0,MartinHafer,Amazing and a bit disappointing.,8,12 February 2012,"Visually, ""Gladiator"" is a masterpiece. I saw a documentary about how they made this film long before I saw the actual movie and it's amazing to see how they used CGI to construct an enormous FULL stadium even though most of it wasn't real! The costumes, props, chariots and trappings were also gorgeous--as good as anything you'll ever see in a film about ancient Rome. And, with some spectacular stunts and TONS of blood, it is brutal--but spectacularly brutal. You really have to see this film and it will knock your socks off.If you look at my summary, however, I say that the film is a bit disappointing as well. As a retired history teacher, I know that much of the history shown in this film is wildly inaccurate. It bears only a very superficial semblance to the facts and it's a shame, as the true story of Emperor Commodus would make for an exciting film. In addition, at times I felt as if the dialog was just awful. Too often, folks talks as if they were making speeches or delivering lines in a high school play. And, it turns out I am not alone. After the film, I read through the IMDb trivia and noticed that the actors ALSO hated the dialog and much of it was changed....though in my opinion, not enough of it was changed. There was often no emotion other than rage or boredom from Maximus, for example. His grief at the crucifixion of his family sounded LESS emotional than it should have--like he was upset that the commissary forgot to but cheese on his burger--not like a man grief-stricken with loss. Simply put, the human side to the film is stilted.So what you are left with is a WILDLY exciting film--a true spectacle. But it lacks the humanity and truth that would have made it even better. Still, it's well worth seeing.",Gladiator
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Disturbing, but beautifully made and well acted, as well as jaw-dropping scenery!",9,15 May 2009,"Ridley Scott rarely disappoints with his films. All of them, including the unjustly-maligned Legend, are visually stunning and just show the director's artistic genius. Gladiator should be up there as one of the best films he's done, if not the best. Almost everything on screen is very graphic, making some scenes upsetting to watch, but the visuals are just outstanding. The music score by Hans Zimmer just adds to the drama that is already there in the script. which is well written and rather Shakespearean. The performances were brilliant, especially Joaquin Pheonix and Oliver Reed. Russell Crowe is wholly convincing in the title role, and Richard Harris and Connie Nielson are also excellent. The costumes are brilliant, as well as the sets. In conclusion, Gladiator is a near masterpiece, only marred by some upsetting scenes. 9/10 Bethany Cox.",Gladiator
2,bkoganbing,The Glory that was Rome was of another day,8,4 October 2020,"35 years after Samuel Bronston and Anthony Mann gave us The Fall Of The Roman Empire, Ridley Scott told the same tale of the Emperor Commodus and
his problems succeeding his legendary father, Emperor/philosopher Marcus Aurelius. Neither film got the story right, both have him killing his father and
both have him with a hero/rival. In the Mann film it's Stephen Boyd in this film it is Russell Crowe. Both have a sister working against him Sophia Loren in the
Mann film and in the Ridley Scott film Connie Nielsen.Although I loved Christopher Plummer in The Fall Of The Roman Empire, truth be told Joaquin Phoenix is closer to the real Commodus. Commodus was only a teen when he became Emperor in 180 AD and reigned a lot longer than it seemed in Gladiator. In real life he was strangled by a wrestler who was part of a conspiracy. He did in fact love the Coliseum and did like to participate occasionally as is shown in both films.In this film when Joaquin Phoenix learns that Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius plans to name Russell Crowe one of his best fighting generals as his successor he kills Harris and Crowe's family. Crowe is sold off in bondage, but works his way back to Rome to take Phoenix down.Gladiator marks he farewell film of Oliver Reed who plays the head of the gladiator school who trains Crowe. Derek Jacobi plays a senator and as he did
in I Claudius dreams of reestablishing the republic.Gladiator won for Best Picture and Best Actor for Russell Crowe and also won for costume design, special effects, and best sound. Sharp film fans will see
bits of both Ben-Hur and Spartacus woven into the story.Gladiator is a well put together drama and Crowe and Phoenix have quite an acting duel. Maybe the real Commodus story will get a film one day. Until then Gladiator and The Fall Of The Roman Empire will do nicely.",Gladiator
3,Leofwine_draca,Epic spectacle,9,22 July 2016,"An epic, awe-inspiring movie which thankfully shows us that Hollywood hasn't forgotten how to make good movies anymore, this is a film which has it all, from intrigue to suspense to violence to subtle romance. Forget any of the other CGI-laden rubbish filling out the multiplexes, this is a film which simply has to be seen at the cinema - or alternatively on a very big television screen indeed. Due to the fact that this film was hyped up incredibly, it doesn't actually live up to the hype, but nothing could have done. GLADIATOR is pure, old-fashioned escapism, nothing less.For once, the acting is totally flawless. Russell Crowe comes out of nowhere to give us a powerful, sensitive action hero, able to emote without the use of dialogue, delivering his lines when needed with a gruff British accent. Crowe is a revelation here - I hated him in VIRTUOSITY, but his acting is excellent and finely judged, right up there with the brooding intensity of De Niro or Pacino. He is well supported by a varied cast, including Connie Nielsen who makes a very sultry and alluring love interest. Joaquin Phoenix makes his snivelling, whining emperor truly despicable, easily soaking up the entire audience's hatred. Oliver Reed is also very good in what was to be his final role, as the proud but friendly slave owner who becomes Maximus' friend. Richard Harris lends an air of nobility and authenticity in his brief role as the dying emperor Caesar, while noted British actors Derek Jacobi and David Hemmings appear as senators.Okay, so the plot of revenge is a fairly clichéd one and the plot here is reminiscent of a whole number of other films, as well as MACBETH, but it is given added power and resonance by the great acting. The music score is also absolutely excellent and really adds to this film's atmosphere. Physically, it is beautifully made and extremely realistic - you constantly feel that you're in Rome itself. Everything is epic and the whole film is chock-full of grandeur. It looks lovely, it sounds lovely, hell, it is lovely.Director Ridley Scott doesn't skimp on the gore front either, leaving in some gruesome shots of people being cut in half, being decapitated and blood spraying in the air and all over the place. The battle scenes are the highlight of the film and are filmed in a weird way - sometimes sped up, sometimes slowed down - which make them so realistic that you do feel like you're there. They're also very exciting, with Crowe taking on ferocious tigers, masked hulking warriors, and chariots too. The twists and turns in the plot are unexpected and there's a moving, poignant ending giving this film an extra element. Old-fashioned, well-crafted and truly splendid - any movie fan owes it to themselves to see this film.",Gladiator
4,SnoopyStyle,Grand,8,2 November 2013,"Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a powerful and popular Roman general. Emperor Marcus Aurelius is an aging ruler who prefers Maximus than his own conniving son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus kills his own father, Maximus refuses to acknowledge the new emperor and his family is slaughtered. He falls into slavery and the gladiator arenas.The scale is a grand. The use of CG is top notch. It really expanded the visual experience to the required spectacle. Russell Crowe takes on the big Hollywood leading man role with ease. Joaquin Phoenix is well conceived as the evil foil to Crowe. The movie has the big battles, and the fun gladiator fights. It is grand in the best traditions of Hollywood.",Gladiator
5,Hitchcoc,Predictable Spectacle,7,23 October 2001,"I never got around to seeing this in the theater. I'm sure it's a marvelous spectacle on the big screen. I don't know what it was. I found the acting good, the spectacle and special effects outstanding, the hero one we could cheer for. Why, then, do I feel so empty? Was it all the hype, best picture of the year? I just don't know. It was totally predictable. There were absolutely no surprises. After seeing The Patriot and realizing both movies have the same plot, I expected something more. Why are evil Roman Emperors always portrayed as cowardly wimps? I still don't believe that he actually was willing to go into the arena with Maximus. He wouldn't have anything to do with war. There is the obligatory killing of the family. That goes back to Macbeth folks. If a ruler wants to stay a ruler, leave the family alone. I know it's just to show how evil and powerful the Emperor is, but do you want the top general in the army gunning for you?--this will guarantee it. There is masterful cinematography in this film. The scenes of violence are masterful. Although once you've seen one fountain of blood spouting up, you've seen them all--one decapitation is like another. What I wanted was to see the characters really dealing with the evil of the times and confronting it. There is always that army out there ready to be commanded again. There is always the possibility that the greatest empire in the world can be destroyed by one guy (like when Mel Gibson won the Revolutionary War all by himself). I think this is really quite a good film. But I don't see it as deserving to be named the best of any year. We've come to demand a movie that looks good rather than one that grasps our heart.",Gladiator
6,kosmasp,Resurrection,8,21 July 2009,"I haven't seen the Director's Cut yet and I have to admit, that the story really didn't capture me as much as it did with others. For once, many things that happened were so foreseeable, I was able to close my eyes, open them a few minutes later and could see what I predicted was gonna happen.While that still works for many movies, it did kind of ruin my enjoyment of the Gladiator. A movie which ""resurrected"" the Sandal movie, as was stated back then. Obviously, ten years later it's safe to say, that didn't really happen. But what made this movie so popular? For one thing, every movie that has a sort of underdog as a main character, can always be sure to get many sympathies. But that's not all! Mr. Ridley Scott shot this movie in a great way. Some symbolisms in the framing and the color scheme, being also responsible for peoples reactions.And while I did like the fight scenes and the scenery in general, the movie left me cold for the main character. I'm not completely alone with my perception of the movie (I still think that a 6/10 is pretty good), but it's more likely that you will like this and won't really think about plot points and the journey of the hero, while you watch this ... Something I couldn't do.Edit: No I watched the longer cut (wrongly called it Director's cut above as Mr. Scott would scold me for saying that earlier - it is just an extended cut) - and unlike Ridley, I actually liked the longer cut better. It added some gravitas and much needed backstory to certain things. And while the movie overall still remains predictable, the scope of it all is plain amazing. Considering the movie started while the script wasn't completely done, might even give this more things to like ... So I reckon I was maybe a bit too harsh on my initial rating (almost everyone I did watch it with fell asleep though), but the rating now is for the rewatch.I still think that other movies (be it the old Spartacus or the newer TV show Spartacus to name a few) did it better ... but considering my love for Sandal movies as a kid, I should have seen the love that was put into this. No matter how easy to decipher and the cliches that were put in. And the fun Russell Crowe had on set .. the behind the scenes pranks, might give you a new view and love for this as well I reckon.",Gladiator
7,classicsoncall,"""Brothers, what we do in life echoes in eternity.""",9,28 June 2014,"I saw Russell Crowe not too long ago in 2012's ""The Man With the Iron Fists"" where he looked about a hundred pounds heavier than he did here; his character was a mercenary named Jack Knife. It was quite a contrast then to see him once again in this film made a dozen years earlier. In fact, considering that Crowe was playing a Roman warrior, he actually looked like he might have been too small for the part. Well, so much for that.""Gladiator"" has an epic sweep not often seen in modern films, the opening battle scene makes you wonder if wars were actually fought that way in ancient times. The political intrigue involved in the plot to murder Maximus (Crowe) and it's failure sets up a dynamic story in which Maximus battles to regain respect and notoriety with the Roman citizenry. Personal relationships are put to the test as Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) proves to be a too cunning adversary to be defeated by normal means.You know, I had to replay the Commdodus/Maximus dungeon scene when Commodus stabbed his enemy, and it didn't make sense to me. When the blade struck Maximus, it appeared to go through his tunic which became blood stained, but in the pull away shot, Crowe wasn't wearing a garment of the same dimensions and he didn't appear to be injured or bleeding. I went back and forth with that one until I decided it had to be an error in filming or editing, but it certainly was a head scratcher.Anyway, this is an intriguing movie as long as you don't let historical accuracy guide you. Or get distracted by the use of elevators to raise soldiers up to ground level of the Coliseum to do battle. What's inspirational is the way Maximus earned the loyalty of his fellow warrior prisoners and their dedication to fight in strength and honor under impossible circumstances.",Gladiator
8,gavin6942,"Great Roman Epic, Better On The Second Viewing",7,18 November 2014,"When a Roman general (Russell Crowe) is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son (Joaquin Phoenix), he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge.The music is very much like that for the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, which should not be surprising given that both come from Hans Zimmer. Did he recycle the music here for ""Pirates"", or is it just a similar style? Hmm.This is the film that really made Russell Crowe an international star, and helped him earn an Oscar (though it probably should have gone to Geoffrey Rush). This is also probably the best film from Ridley Scott since ""Blade Runner"". While on first viewing it may not seem like anything special, it really does present a great telling of Rome and its problems (fictionalized) and could have parallels to empires today.",Gladiator
9,lee_eisenberg,Ave!,7,15 July 2005,"Okay, I'll admit that I didn't consider ""Gladiator"" the best movie of 2000, but it did have it's merits, namely that it focused on plot rather than violence. Russell Crowe certainly did a good job as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix made a nasty Commodus. Although that was sort of the problem: the good guy was 100% good and the bad guy was 100% bad. It might have been a little better if there had been some gray area.But other than that, it was a really good movie. Since we had just gone to Italy when the movie came out (we went for the millennium jubilee), it made the movie all the neater. I guess that you could say: the movies that we watch in life echo in our eternities.",Gladiator
10,jboothmillard,Gladiator,9,6 September 2005,"This is a great story about a man kidnapped, but still keeps doing what he was born to do. Oscar winning, and BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Russell Crowe plays General Maximus, he used to be a soldier who fought a war in Germania. He is thought by King Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) as the son he should have had. Commodus (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Joaquin Phoenix) is the evil man who kills his own father to become king himself. Unfortunately Maximus was taken by a tradesman and he is given to Proximo (BAFTA nominated Oliver Reed) and trained to become a gladiator. He fights against men and animals in front of some audiences. It's when Commodus witnesses one of the shows that he is reminded that he should kill him. Oliver Reed was the most watchable of the actors, besides Crowe, its a shame he died while filming. Also starring Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, Derek Jacobi as Gracchus, Djimon Hounsou as Juba, David Schofield as Falco, David Hemmings as Cassius and Omid Djalili as Slave Trader. An excellent film from Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Alien and Blade Runner director Sir Ridley Scott. It won the Oscars for Best Costume Design, Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, Original Score for Hans Zimmer, and Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Production Design, and Best Film, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, Best Special Visual Effects, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Sound, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama, and Best Original Score. Oliver Reed was number 78, and Russell Crowe number 26 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Reed was also number 26 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, General Maximus Decimus Meridias was number 50 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 98 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for the ending, it was number 24 on The 100 Greatest War Films, it was number 99 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Films. Very good!",Gladiator
11,ccthemovieman-1,A Throwback To The Epics Of The '60s,8,1 November 2006,"An intense Roman epic, a la ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus,"" it was nice to see something like this made again. It had been since the 1960s that we had seen a 3-hour extravaganza like this.Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting. Kudos to the rest of the cast, too.Too bad they don't make more of these type of films, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s.",Gladiator
12,rmax304823,Alpha Males,6,1 June 2007,"The emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is murdered by his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Aurelius's designated successor, General Maximus (Russel Crowe) is betrayed, becomes a slave, a gladiator, finally a the most popular gladiator in Rome, and kills Commodus before he himself drops dead of an unfair wound. Rome is turned over to Senator Grachus and is saved. Commodus's sister (Connie Nielson) has a son who will become the next emperor. Actually, that happy return to a Republic is tacked on, isn't it? Dictatorships continued till the end.I kept trying to figure out just what elements distinguished ""Gladiator"" from the earlier sun and sandal epics of the 1950s, like ""Herculus,"" usually starring some beefed-up parody of a male figure like Steve Reeves, or ""Ben Hur"" for that matter.Obviously ""Gladiator"" is more expensive and the special effects more especially effective. And, thank God, unlike Steve Reeves' epics the movie isn't dubbed, so nobody sounds like Orson Welles gargling.""Gladiator"" is darker all around than almost all earlier movies of the period. Cinecitta was always so sunny and its weather so balmy. There's a moment near the beginning of ""Ben Hur"" when Judah and Massala meet and Massala removes his decorative metal cuirass and reveals the soft scarlet cloth beneath it. It's a neat splash of color. There's nothing like that in ""Gladiator."" The Romans all wear dark clothing, usually black. And their armor is spiky-looking and abrasive, as if influenced by some video game or by Dungeons and Dragons. I guess the Senate wears white but even their robes are drained of brightness, so that they resemble the sheets that my laundry dryer produces. And sometimes it's cold too. Snow falls and the Romans wear fur robes. Pretty ugly stuff.The dialog isn't dubbed but the Foley artists have been hard at work generating the expectable clichés. No sword can be drawn without the slick sound of sharp metal against metal. And God forbid that a sword be thrown through the air without going whoo-whoo-whoo. If one of these behemoths swings his weapon it's invariably accompanied by a swoosh or a wheeesh. I don't know why. It doesn't make the motion more compelling in any way. It's a distraction because somewhere in the viewer's mind there must be the realization that if you swing a piece of metal through the air, it simply does not swoosh. The sounds of battle aren't the only clichés. The ""thumbs down/ thumbs up"" business for death and life was, I think, borrowed from an improvisation in a Cecil B. DeMille movie, not from the historical record.Award for best performance: Richard Harris (his last movie) as Marcus Aurelius, the emperor who is at least as well known for his philosophy -- he was a stoic -- as for his martial exploits. Imagine -- a head of state who can have an original thought? ""Death smiles at all of us and all we can do is smile back."" Award for best-looking and most succulent actress: Connie Nielson. She couldn't be better. I don't know about her performance but she looks absolutely right for the part of the bitter widow, abused by her own brother, hopelessly in love with a man she'll never have. She's beautiful, sensuous, elegant, and as cold as polished steel.Best imitation of Steve Reeves: Russel Crowe, he of the enormous trapezii. I wouldn't want to get in the arena with that guy. His performance? Well -- he tries to laugh at one point.Best bad guy: Joaquin Phoenix isn't bad as the evil, cowardly, deceitful Commodus. It wouldn't surprise me to find that he had an amphora stuffed with ladies' lingerie. I'll give him a pass on insisting on incest, inasmuch as Connie Nielson is the victimized party. But, man, what a creep; no longer the teen age beauty, slightly more plump, and with a thicker voice.Is it worth seeing? Well, of course! Could anything on which so much expense had been lavished NOT be worth seeing? And it's thought provoking too. The thought it provokes is: what is it in human nature that prompts us to watch innocent others suffer and die violently? No? You don't have to look long on the internet to find video clips with titles like ""Iraqi gets blown up,"" or ""Marine has arm shot off!"" We can smugly dismiss ""the mob"" of Romans for their barbaric tastes but we can't pass a highway accident without looking for some mangled limbs. Hell, we revel in it.",Gladiator

14,BA_Harrison,Maximus Excitus Entertainius.,9,27 April 2018,"In the event of his death, ageing Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) intends to leave his trusted Hispano-Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) in charge of Rome, instead of allowing his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to become his successor. Commodus has other ideas: he murders his father and orders Maximus to be executed. Maximus, not one to give up quietly, makes a daring escape, and, badly wounded, heads for home, where he discovers that his wife and son have been crucified on Commodus' orders. Passing out from the pain of his injury, Maximus is captured by slavers, nursed back to health and forced to fight as a gladiator. This new life eventually leads him to the Colosseum of Rome, where he finally comes face to face with the man who betrayed him.From director Ridley Scott, Gladiator is a historical epic to rival the classics from the 'golden age' of Hollywood. Opening in 180 A.D., with a brilliantly orchestrated battle between the Roman armies and the tribes of Germania, Scott's film grabs the viewer's full attention from the outset and doesn't let go until the end, having delivered an Oscar-winning central performance from Crowe, a memorable score by Hans Zimmer, excellent supporting roles from the likes of Harris, Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and Oliver Reed, and some of the most impressively bloody scenes of hand to hand combat ever filmed.If I were to choose my favourite scene, it would be the 're-enactment' of the battle of Carthage, a savage piece of action cinema in which Maximus and his fellow gladiators are ushered into the arena like cattle to the slaughter, only to turn the tables on their attackers, winning the hearts of the Roman masses in the process. A rousing, blood drenched spectacle, it's a fine example of Scott's expert direction, a masterclass in camera placement and movement, editing (the violence is extreme, but the film doesn't wallow in the gore), sound design and special effects, which still thrills even after all of these years.",Gladiator

Rome who soon becomes a fugitive and warrior-slave after the Emperor dies and his ambitious, wicked son (Joaquin Phoenix) takes command. Director Ridley Scott's sword-and-sandal, blood-and-guts spectacular isn't anything original, yet it certainly looks good and has many moments of power and emotion. Scott tries for the sweep of a latter-day ""Spartacus"", but the script isn't as intriguing and the film, while entertaining on the whole, isn't as memorable. Dedicated to actor Oliver Reed (Proximo), who makes his final film appearance, this Oscar winner for Best Picture has old-fashioned ideals transposed after the new-fangled violence, with lots of bloody action to snare modern moviegoers; it works successfully enough, and Scott efficiently uses the long running-time to build character and dramatic tension. **1/2 from ****",Gladiator
16,dbdumonteil,A poor man's Ben Hur,5,4 November 2001,"Completely untrue as far as history is concerned:Marcus Aurelius died from the plague,and he did give his power to his son Commodeus (who did not strangle him,why would he?)On the other hand,Commodeus would have been strangled (in his bath?) but NOT by Maximus.The plot is linear,predictable and owes a lot to ""Ben Hur"".Forget the Christ and we have a similar pattern: a hero's downfall,his family is killed (thrown in jail in Ben Hur),he falls into a slaves(gladiators) trader's hands.He takes a spectacular revenge on his enemy (Commodeus,here,Messala in ""Ben Hur"")Outside Wyler's classic,""Gladiator"" finds some inspiration in Kubrik's ""Spartacus"" and LeRoy's ""Quo Vadis"" too,and even in Delmer Daves'""Demetrius and the gladiators"" (1954)All these sword and sandals,except Daves'one,are superior to Ridley Scott's work.Of course,the battle scenes are impressive,thanks to technology ,but it does not make up for the paucity of the dialogue and the simplicism of the screenplay.The ""poetic"" slow motion ending has been filmed so many times that one wonders why Scott could bother with such a rehash.",Gladiator
17,Quinoa1984,Enjoying the spectacle even more on DVD,9,19 April 2001,"In my first review of Gladiator, I said it had good action.  I think I was a little too subtle with that, because after watching this movie for the first time in a year on the grand DVD, and I see why this film won best picture (though I still feel this is 2nd best to Traffic and Traffic was snubbed like Saving Pvt. Ryan in 99, only that Gladiator isn't mediocre like Shakespeare in Love is).Russell Crowe, as in all of his films commands the attention of the viewer every minute he's on the screen (though once again, Tom Hanks did it better though and also deserved the Oscar, but I'm not mad about it) as a man who is changed as he goes from respected general, to disgraced slave, and then back to respected Gladiator.  Smart, exciting moviemaking all the way, with Scott delivering good direction to the scenes and the rest of the cast being good deliverers to the film (fans of old film stars Reed, Harris and Jacobi will find this a treat).  Even better than I thought it was back last May, and with time should become a classic like Bravheart, though that is better (I also was a little subtle with Braveheart's spectacle). A+",Gladiator
18,michaelRokeefe,What is a man's life worth in ancient Rome.,8,8 June 2001,"This movie is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Exciting story. Well acted. This movie has every element of being an instant classic. Don't haggle about historical accuracy; just enjoy this epic with wild eyed anticipation. A story of love, vengeance and will power.Russell Crowe plays Maximus Meridius, a Roman general that winds up a gladiator after refusing to pledge loyalty the emperor's power-hungry son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). Emperor Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris)on his deathbed wants to turn the leadership of Rome over to Maximus; but the jealous Commodus smothers his already dying father to death and takes over the throne. Maximus escapes a death sentence and becomes a slave; then a gladiator that avenges his murdered family by constantly defying Commodus.
Crowe is excellent as is Phoenix. The two contrasting personae make a great rivalry. Connie Nielsen plays the sister of Commodus and the object of his sexual obsession.

19,sunwarrior13,A Sword-And-Sandal Epic In Modern Hollywood,10,25 February 2012,"Gladiator is a historical epic film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Ralf Möller, Oliver Reed, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel and Richard Harris. Crowe portrays the loyal Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the Emperor's ambitious son, Commodus, murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his Emperor.A man robbed of his name and his dignity strives to win them back, and gain the freedom of his people, in this epic historical drama from director Ridley Scott. In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key adviser to the emperor. As Marcus' devious son Commodus ascends to the throne, Maximus is set to be executed. He escapes, but is captured by slave traders. Renamed Spaniard and forced to become a gladiator, Maximus must battle to the death with other men for the amusement of paying audiences. His battle skills serve him well, and he becomes one of the most famous and admired men to fight in the Colosseum. Determined to avenge himself against the man who took away his freedom and laid waste to his family, Maximus believes that he can use his fame and skill in the ring to avenge the loss of his family and former glory. As the gladiator begins to challenge his rule, Commodus decides to put his own fighting mettle to the test by squaring off with Maximus in a battle to the death. Ridley Scott and an excellent cast successfully convey the intensity of Roman gladiatorial combat as well as the political intrigue brewing beneath.Though the digital effects lack the weight and conviction of their equivalents in old Cecil B. De Mille movies,Scott's sword-and- sandal epic has some of the intensity of old Hollywood in terms of storytelling, spectacle, and violence.",Gladiator
20,hitchcockthelegend,They said you were a giant. They said you can crush a man's skull with one hand.,10,6 August 2014,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is not a perfect film, I would think that the hardiest of fans, of which I'm firmly one, know this deep down. Yet just like Commodus in the film is keen to point out that he himself has other virtues that are worthy, so does Gladiator the film. Enough in fact to make it an everlasting favourite of genre fans and worthy of the Academy Award acknowledgements it received.In narrative terms the plot and story arc is simplicity supreme, something Scott and Russell Crowe have never shied away from. There has to my knowledge as well, never been a denial of the debt Gladiator owes to Anthony Mann's 1964 Epic, The Fall of the Roman Empire. Some folk seem very irritated by this, which is strange because the makers of Gladiator were not standing up bold as brass to proclaim they were unique with their movie, what they did do was reinvigorate a stagnant genre of film for a new generational audience. And it bloody worked, the influence and interest in all things Roman or historically swashbuckling of film that followed post Gladiator's success is there for all to see.What we do in life echoes in eternity.So no originality in story, then. While some of the CGI is hardly ""Grade A"" stuff, and there's a little over - mugging acting in support ranks as some of the cast struggle to grasp the period setting required, yet the way Gladiator can make the emotionally committed feel - overrides film making irks. Crowe's Maximus is the man men want to be and the man women want to be with. As he runs through the gamut of life's pains and emotionally fortified trials and tribulations, we are with him every step of the way, urging him towards his day of revenge splattered destiny; with Crowe superb in every pained frame, winning the Academy Award for Best Actor that he should have won for The Insider the previous year.Backing Crowe up is Joaquin Phoenix giving Commodus preening villainy and Connie Nielsen graceful as Lucilla (pitch Nielsen's turn here against that of Diane Kruger's in Troy to see the class difference for historical period playing). Oliver Reed, leaving the mortal coil but leaving behind a spicy two fold performance as Proximo the Gladiator task master. Olly superb in both body and CGI soul. Richard Harris tugging the heart strings, Derek Jacobi classy, David Hemmings also, while Djimon Hounso gives Juba - Maximus right hand man and confidante - a level of character gravitas that's inspiring.I didn't know man could build such things.Dialogue is literate and poetic, resplendent with iconic speeches. Action is never far away, but never at the expense of wrought human characterisations. The flaming arrows and blood letting of the Germania conflict kicks things off with pulse raising clarity, and Scott and his team never sag from this standard. The gladiator arena fights are edge of the seat inducing, the recreation for the Battle of Carthage a stunning piece of action sequence construction. And then the finale, the culmination of two men's destinies, no soft soaping from Scott and Crowe, it lands in the heart with a resounding thunderclap. A great swords and sandals movie that tipped its helmet to past masters whilst simultaneously bringing the genre alive again. Bravo Maximus Decimus Meridius. 10/10",Gladiator
21,Theo Robertson,Good Hollywood Epic,7,29 March 2002,"It strikes me from the readers comments of the IMDB that as many people dislike GLADIATOR as like it. True it`s the sort of story we`ve seen before in several genres where good defeats evil but what`s wrong with that ? It`s well acted with Joaquin Phoenix playing the role of villain the right side of camp , well supported by a bunch of British thespians - Notice how many of the bad guys are played by Americans and good guys by Brits . Don`t see that too often - and Ridley Scott pulls out all the stops to make GLADIATOR a technical triumph , a shame he didn`t win the Oscar for best director , he`ll be hard pushed to make a film as good as this again. And accolades to John Mathieson and Hans Zimmer for photography and music respectively.GLADIATOR is one of three old fashioned Hollywood epics to have won the Oscar for best picture in recent years . After seeing the overrated BRAVEHEART and the truly awful TITANIC and comparing them with true epics like GONE WITH THE WIND , BEN HUR and LAWRENCE OF ARABIA I thought to myself "" Alas they don`t make them like they used to "". Then GLADIATOR came along and proved me wrong.As a footnote the DVD release to this film is excellent.

Also worth seeing is Oliver Reeds' final performance (he's very good).  All the other acting is OK, but the story is just so drawn out and I was always one step ahead of it.

25,zardoz-13,Caesarean Shlock,5,9 December 2009,"Suffering through ""Gladiator,"" director Ridley Scott's long-winded and sloppily staged Roman soldier epic, whetted my appetite for those glorious sword and sandal sagas that Hollywood produced in the 1950s and the 1960s. Guts, gusto, and grandeur distinguished spectacles such as Melvyn Leroy's ""Quo Vadis"" (1951), Delmar Daves' ""Demetrius and the Gladiators"" (1954), William Wyler's ""Ben-Hur"" (1959), Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus"" (1960), and Anthony Mann's ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" (1964). Although it borrows bits and pieces from those cinematic classics, ""Gladiator"" lacks the passion and charisma which made those movies memorable. Meticulously crafted with stunning, state-of-the-art, digital special effects that recreate ancient Rome, ""Gladiator"" chronicles the tragic fate of a valiant general betrayed and enslaved, who returns as a gladiator to wreak vengeance on a wicked emperorWhile brawny Russell Crowe gives a thumbs-up performance, he is defeated by a thumbs-down script that resembles an uninspired rehash of the Clint Eastwood classic ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"" in a toga with a chicken-hearted villain and a humdrum finale. The action unfolds in Germania in 180 A.D. General Maximus (Russell Crowe of ""The Insider"") wins a brutal battle for his dying emperor, Caesar Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris of ""Unforgiven""), against a Danubian horde. Caesar despises his depraved son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix of ""Clay Pigeons"") and makes Maximus the protector of Rome. Marcus wants Rome returned to the people and he trust Maximus and Maximus only to make this happen. When Commodus learns the bad news, he suffocates his dear old dad in his tent. At Marcus Aurelius' death bed, Maximus defies Commodus and vows to carry out his late emperor's wishes. Swiftly, Commodus has Maximus arrested and taken out to be executed at dawn. Predictably, Maximus outsmarts his moronic captors and escapes. Riding hard for his sprawling farm in faraway Spain, Maximus arrives too late to save his crucified wife and son. Grief-stricken, he falls prey to a band of slave traders who eventually sell him to Proximo (Oliver Reed of ""Hannibal Brooks""). Not only does Proximo teach Maximus how to survive in the arena, but also how to win the kudos of the crowd.Meanwhile, honoring his father whom he murdered, Commodus revives the gladiator battles in the Coliseum. Proximo shows up with his invincible champion and Commodus gets the shock of his life when he discovers that Maximus is alive. The cheering crowds adore Maximus in the area so the corrupt Commodus plots to kill him outside it.Director Ridley Scott of ""Alien"" gums up ""Gladiator"" with a soap opera subplot about the incest between Commodus and his sister. The ""Braveheart"" style battle that opens the movie is so murky that you can barely see the combatants. The actors in the sun-drenched fights are better, but Scott dwells more on clashing swords rather than hair-raising choreography. Sadly, Commodus makes such a weak, sniveling villain that you feel no relief when Maximus squares accounts with him. Ultimately, as colorless as the statues of the Roman rules, who adorn the palaces in this bloody bore of a blockbuster, ""Gladiator"" qualifies as a bust.",Gladiator

Commodus has Maximus wife and child murdered. Maximus escapes before being executed himself, only to be captured and enslaved. He becomes a gladiator and fights to regain his status. Moreover, he is determined to take revenge on Commodus.Pretty much a standard action/revenge movie, set in Roman times. Lots of fight scenes and not much else, including profundity.

I don't think that's completely fair. Sure there are some similarities but ""Gladiator"" is original enough with an own unique style.The movie has a very good unique atmosphere like we are used from Ridley Scott movies. Visually the movie looks wonderful (with the exception of a few fake looking background shots of Rome). Especially the battle scene's (the gladiator fights in particular) are filmed in a wonderful way with some good editing and are something you have never seen before. You can almost feel the tension and fear and smell the sweat of the gladiators when they are entering the arena.The acting is top class! Russell Crowe is a great leading man but was his role Oscar worthy? I don't think so, he deserved an Oscar more for his role in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Joaquin Phoenix gives an impressive performance and the same goes for Richard Harris, Oliver Reed and yes, Spencer Treat Clark that shows his talent.What makes the movie even more complete is the excellent musical score by Hans Zimmer and the great looking costumes and epic settings and feeling.But no the movie is not perfect. The story at times is messy and at times it loses it's speed. It feels like it's just a lame excuse to fill up the scene's between the gladiator fights. Also some characters and moments don't feel needed at all, I don't know I can't really put my finger on it.

29,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,To my wife... none of your business,8,10 January 2011,"In AD 180, after his family(his son and the mother of said kid) are murdered, Maximus(I guess they didn't want to be completely overt and go with Biggus) seeks revenge over the man who also stole the position of ruler of Rome from him; Commodus, who they try really hard to make a villain out of. The acting is marvelous, with Crowe, Phoenix and Reed(R.I.P.) bringing their roles to life. All characters are credible and well-developed. The fighting, although apparently not consistent with reality of how they were trained, is really cool; they're of varying length with nice choreography. They're covered in close-ups and with hand-held, which really gives them a sense of intensity. The scope is epic, and this is realistic and authentic, giving you a feel of how it was back then. This has well-done FX, you basically can't tell the CGI from the real. The photography is excellent, with really impressive visuals. Dialog is fine. It is a tad Hollywood, as the overall thing is. Honestly, I would rate Spartacus higher than this. Kirk has gravitas far beyond that of Russell, the battles are *unforgettable* and powerful, the interplay between the people is heartfelt and rings true(and pays off), and the story is simply more inspirational(slave rises up against his master, early human rights campaign... this is just ""I'm going to get back what I lost or get payback for it"", and could have been set any other time or place). Still, a solid 142 minutes sans credits. There is a lot of disturbing content and bloody violence.

Now, for what I thought of it.I loved it. The story, the acting, the action, it was all good. Russel Crowe just can't go wrong. Can someone tell me a bad movie he was in? Maybe ""Virtuosity"", but even that wasn't that bad. I have to applaud Joaquin Phoenix as well. He played such a loathsome and detestable coward that it was as if he was born for the role.The story was better than just a traditional tale of vengeance. Initially there were no signs or hints that Maximus (Crowe) had the intention of going after Commodus (Phoenix), but once the opportunity presented itself, he definitely was driven towards that goal. And even though we all wanted Maximus to kill Commodus it was more than just that. Maximus was avenging the death of his family and freeing Rome from the hands of a tyrant as well.I really found the story compelling. I found myself wholly behind Maximus and his efforts, if not because of his admirability, then certainly because of Commodus' lack of it.

That's the only reasonable explanation I can offer for how he managed to take the Best Actor prize for this.

He is framed for murder and sentenced to death but he survives only to discover that his wife and son were crucified and burned. Central plot thrusts him in gladiator games where he spends wasted time hacking up soldiers. Triumphant art direction cannot save repetitious story. Director Ridley Scott successfully creates the era but this is hardly a match for his superior films such as Alien and Blade Runner. Crowe carries the film going from honoured soldier to a fighter placed within a bloody game of survival where only his revenge drives him. Joaquin Phoenix overacts tremendously as Caesar who is basically a cardboard villain destine for death and when it happens, it lacks the intended satisfaction. Wasted appearances by Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris. Oliver Reed even appears as an old gladiator who likely wiped his ass with toilet paper that contained more than what this screenplay does. The art direction and visual elements are in top form. The film reflects the Roman Empire and violent sport to entertain the lust for violence. Unfortunately the repetition and violent exploits of the screenplay render this perhaps the most overrated film of the year. Score: 4 ½ / 10",Gladiator
34,Aaron1375,"Rather good action adventure, not sure if it was really an Oscar caliber film.",8,14 February 2010,"This film was released in the summer of 2000 and was a bit more of a film than your typical summer blockbuster. However, I am a bit surprised it won the Oscar award that year mainly because as it is not in its entirety your typical summer blockbuster it has most of the elements of one. It has a lot of action and a lot of blood, granted there is some story to it that makes it a step above mindless summer popcorn film. The movie was also a hit with an R rating which is why I will never understand why they weaken so many films these days, bringing them down to PG-13 thinking this is going to bring them more money. This one proves that you can make a ton of cash with an R rating. This along with other R films like ""300"", the entire Matrix trilogy, ""Hannibal"" (hell this one wasn't even a good movie"", and a host of others yet they still insist on making most movies PG-13. Well enough of that rant, on to this film. Its story is fairly good involving the leader of an army who is basically retiring after the death of the emperor. Well his son for some reason tries to have him killed and does succeed in killing the soldier's family. Well the soldier ends up being sold and becomes a gladiator who amazes the crowd with his awesome brutality. Well he ends up competing in the coliseum where the man who had his family murder watches. So in the end a nice bloody film and one of the few best picture winners I have ever seen at the theater. I think the only other Oscar winners I have seen at the theater are ""Titanic"" and ""Lord of the Rings: Return of the King"". This one is good, I do not know if it really merited an Oscar, but I am not going to say something else deserved it that year either as I remember it being a rather weak year for movies.",Gladiator
35,Wuchakk,What was it like to be a gladiator?,6,13 November 2014,"Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" (2000) takes place in 180 AD and begins with a decisive Roman victory led by General Maximus (Russell Crowe) over the Germanic tribes in what is now Austria. The Emperor (Richard Harris) is dying and wants to turn over control of the empire to the noble Maximus rather than his pathetic son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). After Commodus catches wind of this, Maximus and his family are condemned, but the general survives and winds up a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed), who trains gladiators. Connie Nielsen is on hand as Commodus' sister who sympathizes with Maximus.I saw ""Gladiator"" in the theater when it came out. It was over-hyped at the time and, as a result, I was let down, which isn't to say it's bad—not at all—it's just not as great as the hoopla made it out to be. Maybe I was a little disappointed because it's hard to watch ""Gladiator"" without comparing it to 1960's ""Spartacus,"" the first hour of which represents some of the greatest filmmaking ever, and ""Gladiator"" is underwhelming by comparison (with the first hour anyway).Yet ""Gladiator"" has a lot of strengths, including the serious tone, the score, locations, the recreation of the Colosseum in Rome and the cast. Speaking of the cast, Crowe is probably the film's greatest strength as he makes a worthy protagonist; and Reed is no slouch as he's his typical magnetic self. Believe it or not, Reed died during filming and his remaining scenes had to have his face superimposed over an anonymous actor (!). Maximus' fellow gladiators and friends are also notable (Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller). Furthermore, the arena action sequences are thrilling and indeed give you a glimpse of what it must've been like to be a gladiator.Phoenix is also exceptional as the love-to-loathe villain, but this is where the film suffers. Commodus (obviously derived from 'commode,' lol) is so repugnant and dishonorable that the viewer has no interest in watching overlong dramatic sequences of him in the palace, etc. These scenes could've easily been cut in half.While ""Gladiator"" has a simplistic revenge plot there's some depth to glean here and there. For instance, the Emperor (Harris) chooses Maximus to replace him not only because he loves him as a son, but also because he wants someone outside of the corruption of Roman government to return the empire to a republic. That's what we need in the USA, someone not tainted by Washington politics. Then there's Commodus' sister, Lucilla (Nielsen), who initially comes off ignoble, but then you start to understand her plight and sorta hope she's redeemable.As far as historical accuracy goes (***SPOILERS***), Marcus Aurelius allowed his unworthy son, Commodus, to become Emperor, knowing his incompetence BUT it is believed Aurelius wanted Claudius Pompeianus to succeed him as Caesar in preference to Commodus but was turned down, just as Maximus turned him down in the film. The fictional character of Maximus was partially based on Pompeianus, who had a similar career to Maximus' and personality traits as well, as documented by Herodian. In fact, Pompeianus married Marcus Aurelius' daughter, Lucilla, following the death of Lucius Verus. Maximus was also an amalgam of historical people like Narcissus (which was the protagonist's name in the first draft and Commodus' real-life killer), Spartacus (who, of course, led a significant slave revolt), Cincinnatus (a farmer who saved Rome from invasion, then resigned his six-month ruler-ship after 15 days), and Marcus Nonius Macrinus (a faithful general and friend of Marcus Aurelius). As for Commodus' entering the arena at the end and taking on a mighty (albeit wounded) gladiator and dying, Commodus was known to engage in show combat in the Colosseum, but he was actually strangled by the wrestler Narcissus in his bath, not killed in the arena, and he ruled for a dozen plus years, unlike the relatively short time shown in the movie.Say what you will about these (common) cinematic deviations, but the movie does inspire you to look-up the historical facts. The film runs 155 minutes (the extended cut 171 minutes) and was shot in England (the opening battle scenes), Malta, Morocco, Tuscany and Lone Pine, CA.GRADE: B-",Gladiator

This give you a good feel for the brutality of the time, and the sort of honor that follows this hypocrisy. A good epic. The budget was big enough to make this a believable epic, and the action is done with perfection.  It's nice to see lesser name actors in films these day, because it give you bigger over all budget for the film instead of watching some one get payed 30 million and it hurts the rest of the film.

41,JamesHitchcock,Excellent Revival of the Epic Tradition,8,3 November 2004,"One of the strange aspects of cinematic history is how an entire genre of films can suddenly lose favour and disappear. In the fifties and early sixties big historical epics, with story lines normally drawn either from the Bible or from classical antiquity, were one of the most popular types of film, and their popularity seemed assured after the huge successes of 'Ben-Hur' in 1959 and 'Spartacus' the following year. A few years later, however, they all but disappeared from the screen after the financial failures of 'Cleopatra' and 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'. The genre seemed to be dead and gone; when the film-makers of the late sixties, seventies and eighties made films on a large scale, they generally turned to other subject-matter (often organised crime or science fiction).What is gone, however, is not always gone for ever. The nineties saw, at least on a limited scale, revivals of a number of genres which had seemed to be in decline- the Western ('Dances with Wolves'), the mediaeval history lesson ('Braveheart'), the big-scale disaster movie ('Titanic'), the war film ('Saving Private Ryan') until, finally, it was the turn of the classical epic. Ridley Scott chose to revive the genre by starting where 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' had left off thirty-six years earlier, with the story of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus.The two films have a similar plot. Both start with Marcus Aurelius leading the Roman legions to victory over the German tribes on the Empire's northern frontier. In each case he is assisted by an able second-in-command (called Livius in the earlier film, Maximus in the later). In each case the Emperor has doubts about the fitness of his son, Commodus, to succeed him, but is murdered before he can put into practice a scheme to prevent his son's accession. Commodus proves to be a tyrannical ruler, and the second half of each film deals with the struggle between the evil Emperor and his late father's friend, who represents the forces of good. In 'Gladiator', Maximus also has a personal motive to seek revenge, because Commodus was responsible for the murders of his wife and young son. He himself survives an attempt by Commodus to have him killed, but he is sold into slavery and forced to become a gladiator. (There are parallels here with another Roman epic, 'Spartacus'). Maximus's skill with weapons ensures that he quickly rises to the top of his new profession, and when his troupe is taken to Rome to fight in the Coliseum he sees an opportunity for revenge. The older classical epics were noted for spectacle, and 'Gladiator' is a worthy successor in this regard. The opening battle between the Romans and the Germans and the scenes of combat in the arena are both vivid and exciting. It does not, however, rely on spectacle alone. Like the more distinguished of the earlier epics (especially 'Spartacus') it contains some very good acting performances. Russell Crowe, as Maximus, shows that he has, like Kirk Douglas or Charlton Heston, the commanding presence to take centre stage in a film of this nature. He brought out both Maximus's physical courage and his nobility, and his 'best actor' award was well-deserved. Oliver Reed, in his final film, was also good as the gladiator trainer Proximo, as was Richard Harris as the ageing Emperor Aurelius (although I preferred Alec Guinness's interpretation of the same role in 'Fall of the Roman Empire'). Joaquin Phoenix brought an original touch to the role of Commodus, portrayed as a basically weak and petulant young man rather than a ranting tyrant. His cruelty arises from his sense of weakness and insecurity. Both 'Gladiator' and 'Fall of the Roman Empire' are, to some extent, historically inaccurate. All the evidence, for example, suggests that Marcus Aurelius died of natural causes, and he does not seem to have entertained any doubts about his son's fitness to rule. (It is not, however, a goof, as some have claimed, to show Commodus fighting in the arena; there is historical evidence that he did so on many occasions). The politics of 'Gladiator', with its preference for republicanism over monarchism, seem to reflect modern American values rather than Roman ones. The distinction between a republic and a monarchy was not as clear-cut then as it is now. The Romans, even when they were ruled by an Emperor, continued to refer to their state as 'res publica', and the Emperor never claimed to be a king. (The title 'Rex' was never used during this period; the Latin title 'Imperator' literally means 'Commander'). Succession from father to son was not automatic; the accession of Commodus was the first time in over a hundred years that an Emperor had been succeeded by his natural, as opposed to adopted, son. If Aurelius had really wanted to disinherit Commodus, he could have done so by adopting some distinguished Senator or military leader as his successor. (Aurelius himself was no blood-relation to his predecessor Antoninus Pius). It seems unlikely that he would have wanted to abolish the office of Emperor and replace it with direct rule by the Senate (which was an oligarchy, not a democratically elected Parliament).I was not, however, too worried by this; 'Gladiator' is by no means the only historic drama to look at the past through the eyes of the present. (Indeed, it is probably impossible when making such a film to avoid this trap altogether). 'Spartacus', for example, projected modern ideas about political freedom back to ancient Rome, and 'The Egyptian' had the people of ancient Egypt practising a quasi-Christian religion more than a millennium before the birth of Christ. The epic tradition had been allowed to languish for too long. Ridley Scott showed, in this intelligent and visually striking film, that it was possible to revive it with success, a revival that has continued with 'Troy' this year and 'Alexander the Great' to come next year. I should also mention Hans Zimmer's excellent musical score, which seems well on the way to becoming a modern classic. 8/10",Gladiator
42,StevePulaski,The olde style before substance,4,2 March 2012,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a film that is acted and directed very well, but is an eyesore to look at for two and a half hours. The film's effects are nice, which got the film an Oscar in 2000, and so are the costumes, but they are all captured in a dirty, muddy tone. Most of the film is a dingy colored brown, appearing as if someone imbedded dirty in the camera lens.The film's plot is just a revenge story, soaked within a period piece. It involves General Maximus Decimus Meridius (Crowe), the leader of the Roman Army in AD 180. Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Harris) is very pleased with his latest victory, and grants him leadership, much to the dismay of the Emperor's son, Commodus (Phoenix). It isn't long before Commodus is consumed with rage, and murders his father, claiming the throne as his.Commodus puts out an order to the Praetorian men to kill Maximus's wife and son. Before Maximus can return in time to stop them, they are killed. Being in a functioning state of depression, and after being kidnapped by slaves who teach him how to fight, Maximus finds out he has a knack for fighting and slaying people. So the plot is born. Maximus is a great gladiator, and continues to fight and murder, leading up to his appearance at the Roman Colosseum.I've established that the film is long, which it is, but it is also fairly impotent. It's slow, a bit dreary, yet well written in the sense that decent dialog is always recited. After a while, though, you begin to grow weary of the film's hushed tone, and about five battle scenes later, the material begins to overstay its welcome.The film is slowly paced, but it definitely has a grand appeal. Crowe's performance is fantastic, and he brings life to a new action hero. For the brief time we see him, Richard Harris does a fantastic Emperor, and Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job playing a despicable, intolerable villain.I also stated that the film's costumes are nice, which they are, but after two hours they become sort of a chore to stare at. Some nice CGI is used, some scenes made up entirely of it, yet again, everything looks the same. Everything is mostly brown, green, and black, and very monotonous and harmful on the eyes.Not to mention, no characters are really developed at all. The film is two and a half hours, and neglects to give us very many personal traits of the characters. This is the perfect case of style over substance; a movie trait I've run into far too much recently. To value style over substance is to put looks in front of every other concern, rather than efficiency and depth. John Logan, one of the three writers of this film, would give us so many character traits of Howard Hughes in The Aviator, four years later. It's a shame that wasn't put in the foreground rather than a loud score and heavy action sequences with this.Gladiator isn't perfect, but it's a fairly memorable action flick, with some ups and downs. To me, this seems like a long B movie, with marvelous special effects and well known actors. It's just a shame that in two and a half hours we have to listen to decent, yet sometimes, redundant dialog, trait-less characters, and stare into a vast field of brown. At least we get Oscar worthy performances to watch for the most part.Starring: Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Ralf Möller, and Richard Harris.

43,Smells_Like_Cheese,Eh,3,20 August 2004,"""Gladiator"". What is there to say about the ""Braveheart"" wannabe? May I say that this movie is just too highly over rated.

Like I said, there are 2 or 3 scenes worth watching. But after a while you'll want to throw yourself out the window after boring yourself. This movie can work for some, but as for me.

But, try as it may, the film fails to connect on the human level. What could have been a powerful epic which clearly defined the undercurrents of good and evil responsible the climate of political unrest and upheaval in Rome instead takes a simplistic ""good guy"" versus ""bad guy"" approach, gets too involved in it's own grandeur, and substitutes action for story telling with the likely result of a disconnected audience which will not feel the empathy and emotion such a film should command.

45,MovieAddict2016,"""Braveheart: Redux."" Give me the original any day...",5,20 October 2003,"I originally saw ""Gladiator"" (2000) in the year of its release, and after seeing the movie again last night, my position on the film has not changed. I did not like it three years ago, and I still do not like it. Back then I was not reviewing on a professional basis--in fact, I had just started submitting comment/recommendation reviews on the Internet Movie Database. I gave ""Gladiator"" a bad comment and moved on. Now I can criticize it a bit deeper.""Gladiator"" stars Russell Crowe as Maximus, a Roman soldier who conquers in practically any and every battle. Caesar (Richard Harris) likes Maximus, and so he decides to give the throne to him after he dies and not to his immoral and irresponsible son (Joaquin Phoenix, who played Merrill in ""Signs,"" a much better movie).However, when Caesar's plans are revealed to his son, he murders his father and takes his place as Caesar, commanding Maximus to be taken out into the woods to be murdered. However, Maximus, being the great soldier that he is, escapes and flees back home to his wife and child--only to find them burned alive and hanging dead outside the house.Maximus eventually comes into custody and is thrown in a gladiatorial arena, where he becomes the main star, killing and conquering in every battle. Soon he is like a modern day baseball player--fans line up outside the Colosseum just to see him before the battles begin.Soon the new Caesar finds out who the great gladiator really is, and so turmoil begins. The new Caesar's sister (Connie Nielsen) once loved Maximus, so that is thrown in for good measure, too. While we're at it, let's throw in some futuristic battleships, robots and space aliens that Maximus can fight in the sequel, when he comes back from the dead. (And I'm not kidding about the following--a prequel is planned.)The movie is slow, and when it picks up speed it goes nowhere. It seems like a rip-off of ""Braveheart"" from beginning to end--a soldier's family is murdered and he takes revenge on the man/nation who killed them by fighting. Granted, he has no choice but to fight in ""Gladiator,"" but still...The movie was directed by Ridley Scott, the Englishman who directed ""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner"" and, among more recent films, ""Matchstick Men."" He's a talented director with an eye for atmosphere, but his films don't always work because sometimes his atmosphere gets the better of him--like in ""Gladiator."" The surroundings are dull, bleak and heartless. ""Braveheart"" had some ounce of beautiful settings, and Mel Gibson used long, wide lens shots of Scotland. Here we just get what we are presented with. And when the camera does pull back to give us the full picture, it's usually packed with very bad CGI effects of Colosseums and such.And Russell Crowe. How did he ever win (and I do mean it when I say ""win"") an Oscar for this mess? He delivers every line with the same monotone deadness in his voice as thirty minutes earlier in the film. He is and remains one of my least favorite actors, both on and off the screen. And if he wants to beat me up for saying mean things about him (as he usually does to people), he can just come over to my house and try. The greasy-haired baboon.The dialogue in the movie. Oh my! Things are said that you expect to read in a letter from a six-year-old to his/her parents. (I was just waiting to hear, ""My family is dead. I am sad."")To be honest, there were a few good moments in ""Gladiator."" It has some impressive fight scenes, including one with two men fighting while tigers leap out of cages built underneath the sand of the arena floor and lunge for the battling duo. I must say that I came close to recommending the movie at certain times. But then it would slow down its pace again and turn into some sort of large-budget cornball. I understand that many people love this movie. Give me ""Braveheart"" any day.2.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",Gladiator
46,Rainey-Dawn,A True Epic! A Phenomenal Film!,10,29 June 2014,If you have never seen the movie Gladiator (2000) then you are missing out on one of the best epic films ever made. The movie lives up to all it's hype and I think it will be a film that people will love to watch for years to come. It's one of my all time favorite movies.The cinematographers did an outstanding job as did the movie editors. The costuming and sets are impeccable. The cast could not have done finer at acting out each of their roles that they played so believably and beautifully well. The timing of the actors could not have been executed any better.The story is so extraordinarily good that it will leave you as breathless as all the action going on. The fight scenes will have you on the edge-of-your-seat as the men battle to the death for victory.The film's ending came as a surprise to me - so much better than I was ever imagining. It was the perfect ending to a perfect movie. Not a historically accurate film - but a great movie that will leave you thinking in the very end.10/10,Gladiator

48,sddavis63,A Very Good Movie That Could Have Been Even Better,7,24 March 2002,"The beginning of ""Gladiator"" is powerful. We see the Roman Legion fighting against the Germanic tribes in what surely must be one of the most spectacular battle scenes ever filmed; one which truly does give the viewer a taste of what warfare in that era must have been like. The ending is powerful, as the quest for vengeance finally comes to a head, with General Maximus facing the Emperor Commodus in a gladiatorial contest in the Roman arena. In between - well - things could have been a little better.The acting in this movie, I thought, was first-rate. Russell Crowe as General Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodus and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla, sister of Commodus, all played their parts perfectly. The gladiatorial bouts were superbly choreographed. The set decoration was magnificent, and looked exactly as I would expect Imperial Rome to have looked. So, why do I say this could have been better?(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Basically, the whole thing was just a bit too clear-cut for me. Maximus was too obviously the good guy, Commodus too obviously the bad guy. With this being so clear, we know that the movie must be heading for the final confrontation between the two, and it makes watching the middle 90 minutes or so difficult. ""Get on with it,"" I found myself thinking from time to time. It didn't have to be quite so clear cut. The potential was there to give the viewer a real ethical choice to make. I mean, one can understand Commodus being angry when Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) - his father - takes away the throne that Commodus had believed all his life would be his, and hands control of Rome over to Maximus. Commodus could have been a sympathetic character. He didn't have to murder his father. His father was elderly; a natural death wouldn't have been out of the question. And why the incestuous fascination with Lucilla? I didn't think it added anything to the movie - except to make Commodus even more repulsive. In the end, the movie didn't make me think about anything; it didn't challenge me with any moral decision-making; it didn't make choosing sides in this battle even remotely difficult.Don't get me wrong. This was a very good movie. One can always argue whether this movie or that should have been named best picture; one certainly has to agree that ""Gladiator"" was worthy of consideration. I just felt it could have been better. In the end, I give it a rating of 7/10.",Gladiator
49,cherold,If you like to see heads chopped off then this is for you,4,8 July 2000,The critical acclaim for this movie really puzzles me.

51,ElMaruecan82,The film that 'won' the crowds of the new millennium...,9,30 April 2017,"In 2003, the American Film Institute presented the Top 100 Screen-Characters, fifty each in the hero and villain category, with the fiftieth spots belonging to the most recent characters: Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington) from ""Training Day"" was the last bad guy and in the heroic department: General Maximum Decimus Meridius, Russel Crowe as the titular 'Gladiator'. His reputation outgrew ""Training Day"" and deservedly so, as the film not only resurrected the 'swords and sandals' genre but a new trend of spectacular entertainment that defined film-making of the new millennium.Like Jesus Christ in the Antiquity timing, there would be a before and an after ""Gladiator"" and like Caesar, one's got to give Ridley Scott the credit he deserves. He didn't use CGI for the sake of special effects but for storytelling, it was still the post-""Titanic"" era where CGI was used for the sinking, but the rest was made of flesh, props and bones, ""The Phantom Menace"" had CGI as vital as the actors, maybe more, but Scott used them to recreate the Coliseum, to make the cheerful crowds look real, to transport us into a universe that had deserted screens ever since the 60's: Antique Rome, as if its historical fall had spread to Hollywood. The use of CGI isn't perfect but it is the job of the story to distract your eyes and mind so that you won't try to spot the flaw, and speaking for myself, I was so enthralled by the story that I didn't even want to spot any flaw.Indeed, the real power of ""Gladiator"" is in the story, one of disconcerting simplicity, whose pitch could take indeed the time of an elevator ride but the treatment and the performances enrich it with a Shakespearian texture. You can say it's a story of an ambitious son who kills his father, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to prevent him from restoring the power to the people, but the performance of Joaquin Phoenix is of a dark, brooding and twisted man who can't stand the paternal rejection and surrenders to the reality of his own wickedness and commits the irreparable act. You can almost feel Commodus killing a part of himself with his father, the only shade of goodness left in his heart. If he can't rule because he's too amoral, so be it, and let's start a descent that will go as far as turning the victor of the Barbarians into a mortal enemy.Yes, I started with the villain, but it's the villain that gives its flavor to the film, and Commodus encompasses such a high degree of corruption that he inevitably highlights the straight morality of Maximus, his father's most faithful lieutenant, the son he wished he had. Oscar-winning Russell Crowe plays the general with enough depth and passion to be as believable as Mel Gibson when he played William Wallace (Gibson was the initial choice) but the real power of Crowe is to keep a low profile, never overplay the heroism figure, he's a man not guided by power or ambitions, freed from any corrupting torment, his only wish is to get back to his home near Trujillo. His moral 'cleanness' creates the perfect balance with a villain whose mind is clouded by hatred, Maximus seems ""one-dimensional"" because we relate to him as a good father and a good son while we're more captivated by the back-story of Commodus. The Emperor's last line ""your faults as a son are my failure as a father"" are the kind of lines Shakespeare might have been proud to write.There are elements of ""Julius Caesar"" and ""Spartacus"" but the resulting mix is unique and a standalone classic served by powerful performances, Connie Nielsen is the sister of Commodus and Maximus' previous mistress, and Oliver Reed makes his final performance as Proximo, the slave merchant and former gladiator who starts to respect Maximus as he realizes his value and encourages him to ""win the crowd"" as the only way to earn his freedom. Maximus couldn't care much about freedom, his only wish is to avenge his family and join them in the afterlife, a secret he shares with his fellow slave, a Numidian played by Djimon Hounsou. The films covers many layers from spectacular entertainment to its arousing story and while not being totally accurate, it is engaging in every department and captures the essence of movies as an art of storytelling and spectacle, using special effects, even to recreate a heart-pounding fight with a tiger, something meant not to be noticed.And all the special effects of the world wouldn't have a point if we didn't care for the characters in the first place.The film is known for having been severely bashed by Roger Ebert himself, I read his review and I got some of his points about the fuzzy and muddy look, and yes, there might have a few abuse of the bluish American light, but there's a scene that can summarize my feeling. When Maximus is encouraged by the crowd to kill one of the gladiator, he's popular already, he earns the respect of the crowd but when he spares the fighter, there's a hesitation, some of the audience boos but it then turns into cheers again as he's called ""Maximus the Merciful"".When you win the crowd, whatever you do will look good, I guess whatever Scott did could pass, his film, along with the Best Picture Oscar of the year, had won the crowd as well, and deserves a special nod as one of the most defining and influential movies of the 2000's. Or well, let's just say ""I was entertained"" to the point I didn't want to spot any visual flaw. That's how good it is.",Gladiator
52,paul2001sw-1,History updated,7,28 September 2004,"According to the brilliant but eccentric historian Gibbon, the succession of the philosopher-king Marcus Aurelius by his mad son Commodus marked the start of the decline of the Roman Empire. It was this event which provided the setting for Anthony Mann's 1960s film, 'The Fall of the Roman Empire', and 'Gladiator' is a modern reworking of the same story, with a hefty nod to Kubrick's 'Spartacus' as well. At first, what catches the attention is what's new in the film: the odd, Enya-esque soundtrack and the impressive, almost convincing but over-used computer generated animation (I mean, how many digitally-enhanced thunderstorms does one film need?). But behind the slickness, what's more noticeable is how firmly this film sits in the tradition of earlier Roman epics. I rather like this genre, as the inherent political and personal drama in these almost true stories is immense; though in 'Gladiator', some of the potential is lost through sentimentality and a tendency to reduce events to an elemental struggle of good and evil. Russell Crowe in particular, all honour and valour, is dull in the central role. But as is usual in films such as this, a clutch of talented British thespians lend some class to the project: in this case, Richard Griffiths, Derek Jacobi, John Shrapnel and of course Oliver Reed, his magnificent eyes still wild with life (though he died before filming was complete). Overall, 'Gladiator' is a welcome addition to a canon that has lain untouched since 'Cleopatra'. What I'd really like to see, though, is a film of the life of Dicoletian, one of Gibbon's few heroes in the long tale of the dark years.",Gladiator

But what makes this movie great is the story line is heart felt and you feel for Maximus after his family is murdered. It is the ultimate tale of revenge.
Russell Crowe is a great actor. I never heard of him before Gladiator but since seeing this I have watched a bunch of other films he is in. He's pretty good in them all.

So, I can now cross this one off my list.I think they are right in suggesting that this is one of those films that would have been really good to see in the cinema, namely due to many of the grandiose scenes, and it doesn't really translate all that well to the small screen (though I should mention that televisions these days are much, much bigger than they were back when this was released, though I suspect mine is really just the size of a large TV back in those days).The story is pretty well known though. The film is set during the later part of the Roman Empire, during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus. Actually, the film is the tail end of Aurelius' reign, namely because he has this great idea of returning Rome to the glory days of the republic and his son really isn't all that keen on not getting the opportunity to rule, so he basically kills his father and takes the throne instead. Oh, and Aurelius had offered the throne to Maximus, but like what happens in Game of Thrones, nobody is around to actually witness this transaction, so Maximus is taken out and killed, except he manages to escape and ends up as a gladiator.What surprised me is that there is an awful lot of intrigue in this film, but then again that was pretty much the nature of the Roman Empire. Also, this seemed to be a shorter, and more tamer, version of A Game of Thrones, even though the period in with Game of Thrones was set was supposed to be the English Civil War. However, that is something that I picked up when I read some of the histories of Rome that were written back during the Roman Empire, that there was intrigue. However, I guess that is just the nature of politics, and when played right, the intrigue certainly does work pretty well.Another thing that stood out was that the musical score was the same as that used in Pirates of the Caribbean (though I suspect that was released after this film, so when we watched it back in the day that wouldn't has stood out all that much). Yet, watching it now it certainly does stand out at lot more, probably because Pirates does happen to be pretty ubiquitous these days, with there being something like four films.It's a pretty long film mind you, and I can't say that it really is one of my favourites, and of course Rusty's Australian accent certainly does stand out here. Then again, one really can't complain all that much considering that in reality back in the day they would have been speaking Latin, and the accent no doubt would have been closer to Italian. Still, that is a minor point, though the major point is that it certainly deviates quite a long way from what actually happened (Commodus was not killed in the area, and I doubt he would have gone into the arena anyway - he was assassinated though, but that tended to be the typical way an Emperor left the throne, very few of them died of natural causes).Yeah, it was pretty good, but it certainly isn't one that I could watch again in a hurry, or multiple times either, but then again I probably don't have huge amounts of time to watch films anyway, particularly with all the other ones that I want to watch beforehand.",Gladiator
61,paulclaassen,Beautiful film!,8,2 February 2021,"'Gladiator' is a spectacle of note and a film everyone should see at least once. Jealousy, ambition, greed, betrayal, loyalty, and vengeance are all so well illustrated here. It is an excellent script and very well executed.Russell Crowe is good as Maximus, a man who lost everything in the blink of an eye. Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the antagonist, Commodus. Commodus is the epitome of a true villain. You will hate him. The film features all round good performances from a seasoned cast.Despite the film's long running time, it is never boring. From the impressive opening battle scene to the climatic finale, it is action and intrigue all the way. However, due to the film's theme, there's a lot of bloody and violent killings, hence the film can be grim and depressing at times.Ultimately, though, 'Gladiator' is a fantastic tale of vengeance. The photography is beautiful and the sweeping score is filled with so much emotion. Despite plenty of brutality, 'Gladiator' is still an absolutely beautiful film.",Gladiator

63,Movie Nuttball,Arguably the greatest film ever!,10,13 April 2003,"May Contain Some Spoilers.This comment is My opinions.I already commented of the wonderful epic but there just something I wanted to say. First I feel that this is the one of the greatest films ever and it is arguably the greatest film of all time and I feel that everything was perfect. The cast, the music, the sets, everything and the scenes are perfected with such emotional moments. One is that When Maximus returns home to find his family. Russell Crowe put everything he had into that scene! The performances of the great actors Oliver Reed and Richard Harris was outstanding and Joaquin Phoenix was the perfect choice to play Emperor Commodus and what a performance and Connie Nielsen  was such a smart choice. It was a treat to see Omid Djalili, Sven-Ole Thorsen, Ralf Moeller, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, and Tommy Flanagan in one film! One of the greatest things about this epic blockbuster is the music by great composer Hans Zimmer. During the scene when Commodus and Marcus Aurelius are together for the last time (Patricide which it is called on the soundtrack which is track 7) the music plays during this scene and it fits the it perfectly and I believe that that is the greatest piece of music ever composed and I think this is Zimmer's greatest score ever and I don't think he'll be able to top it. Lisa Gerrard's singing in the film is beautiful! Buy the soundtrack along with the second great album by Zimmer and Gerrard on Amazon.com for a low great price! The second album I feel is even better than the first! Ridley Scott's direction was great and I loved the fast past camera effort and the battles were so good and exciting! That's all I wanted to say. I feel that Gladiator gets 10 stars and is one of the greatest films ever made! If you have not seen this awesome movie yet then when you have a chance rent or even buy it because believe Me when you watch it you won't want to stop and you'll want to see it again and again. Its truly a special film and I Hope that everyone will be able to see the golithian epic!",Gladiator

Its been suggested it is a mindless action flick, using computer effects to take attention away from a flimsy plot - not so.  The script is fine and a hundred times better than the last epic I was unfortunate enough to see in the cinema - Titanic.  Gladiator has a lot of heart and yes, the story may be a little hackneyed, there may be reminders of everything from Ben Hur to Caligula, but the acting is superb, the effects (which don't detract from the story) are great and the whole piece is very enjoyable.

65,Thanos_Alfie,Simply amazing...,8,14 March 2021,"""Gladiator"" is an Action - Drama movie in which we watch a man seeks revenge from the Roman emperor who set the murder of his family and tried to kill him too. He has to find a way to approach the emperor and be ready to take his revenge.I liked this movie very much because it had an amazingly interesting plot that kept me in tense through its whole duration and the direction which was made by Ridley Scott was simply outstanding. The interpretation of Russell Crowe who played as Maximus was iconic and I believe that he did an excellent job. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joaquin Phoenix's who played as Commodus, Richard Harris' who played as Marcus Aurelius and Djimon Hounsou's who played as Juba. In conclusion, I have to say that ""Gladiator"" is an amazing movie and I highly recommend everyone to watch it because I am sure that you will be amazed by it.",Gladiator
66,Dr_Coulardeau,The illusion of Roman civilization,9,3 July 2008,"This extended version is a lot denser that what I remembered of the 2000 commercial version. The politics of Rome are explored in a lot more detail, particularly that strange power the Roman Emperor had because of his own praetorian guard that was doing absolutely everything he ordered, and took orders only from the Emperor. At the end, when the Emperor is dead or nearly dead because he is defeated and disarmed, they refuse to obey their own officer. They will obey him only when the sister comes down and legitimizes Maximus. You only meet servile people and even the Senate and the Senators are just as servile out of fear for their welfare. That could be extended to today, even if today in our democratic countries this manipulation of people is less obvious, less direct, less based on the fear of the leaders but on the fear of an external danger propped up and exploited by the leaders. Fear is still the main nerve of the crowd, and then provide them with some bread and good circus entertainment and they will follow your fears to the end of the world. The film is also extremely clear about two barbaric practices of this supposedly civilized Roman Empire. The conquest war that is not, far from it, always justified by any offensive aggressivity from the ""barbarians"" from beyond the frontiers of the empire. It is brutal and unequal. The advanced technology of the time is on the Roman side. Easy to win when you add to this advanced technology the military professionalism of the Roman Legion. And even so it is shown as what it is: an unclean inhumane and inhuman practice. Worse even the film shows the slave trade and the total reduction of these slaves not even to animals but to objects, properties, commodities you deal with and dispose of the way you want. What the film does not say is that the vast majority of this Roman society is composed of slaves, house slaves, garden slaves, hard work slaves, sex slaves and of course the famous gladiators, the fighting slaves. They all end in death, these slaves, a vast majority premature death imposed onto them by their masters or circumstances, but always to satisfy the desire of a free Roman citizen. The particularity of gladiators is that their end is to die in public from the hand of another gladiator or just mangled by a wild beast or some technical trap. At the top of the ladder of that death is the death decided by the Emperor himself. The film is of course extremely precise about these circus entertainments though concentrating only on the gladiators. There were many other ways to entertain the populace in the Coliseum, true entertainment always bringing death to some people down there in the arena for the real pleasure of the public. This has not changed at all, I mean the pleasure of being the witness of some gross, violent, repulsive dying process imposed onto the dying person by one or many other human beings. The only change is that it does not happen in circuses any more, and with real live, if I can say so, performances of the death of each victim. We have invented in the meantime a machine that enables us to give the illusion of seeing that and yet that does not happen for real. That is called the cinema. In the old days, the Greeks had dramatic productions for that cathartic function, but the Romans did not want anything illusionary, they wanted the real thing and they got it for several centuries with these gladiators and later the Christians, and all the time the executing in public places of all discontents, and even, when you could afford a slave, the real torturing and killing in all possible variations of your slave. We seem to forget, and this film reminds us of it, that the Roman Empire, and before it the Greek or Hellenistic empire was just based on the inflicting of death to any kind of people as the very justification of the social order, the political order or plainly your own prestige or authority. And some speak of this empire as a great period of civilization. Due to these slaves some inventions like watermills devised in the first century BCE were only exploited in the 10th century CE by the Benedictines, hence in the middle of what some call the dark ages (sorry no capital letters). A great film in this extended version.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Gladiator
67,zkonedog,"""Death Smiles At Us All. All We Can Do Is Smile Back""",9,5 March 2017,"For all you really avid movie-watchers out there, think about this question for a minute: Have you ever seen a movie starring Russell Crowe where you said ""that was really bad?"". I didn't think so either.For a basic plot summary, ""Gladiator"" tells the story of Maximus (Crowe), one-time member of the Roman army turned gladiator slave at the hands of tyrant ruler Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). While fighting all that the Colosseum can throw at him, Maximus must also inspire a revolution to return Rome to its former glory.Despite starting off quite slow for the first 30-40 minutes, ""Gladiator"" quickly becomes top- notch drama primarily because of the simmering intensity Crowe brings to his role. Without his presence in this film, I cannot think of another actor who could have turned in such a nuanced, show-carrying performance. His gravitas on screen carries itself almost without dialogue whatsoever.This is also the kind of film (much like Crowe's later work ""Robin Hood"") that is quite long but only builds on itself. It takes some time for the real drama to really kick in, but when it does it is all the more pertinent because of the character development we have already seen.Overall, ""Gladiator"" is a great movie that has a little something for everyone. If you like historical fiction, battle scenes, drama, or incredible acting, than this film will capture your interest for a full two and half hours. I can easily see why it cleaned up at the Academy Awards in 2001.",Gladiator
68,filipemanuelneto,A solid and epic blockbuster that still impresses us today.,8,1 December 2019,"This film is set in the golden age of the Roman Empire, at the end of the reign of Marcus Aurelius and the early years of Emperor Commodus. Maximus is a brilliant Roman general, the favorite of the old emperor, who wishes to restore the Roman Republic and sees in his successor a project of bloodthirsty tyrant. However, Commodus manages to kill his father and succeed him before he carries out his plans, becoming absolute lord of Rome and orders to kill Maximus and all his family. Trapped and sold into slavery, he becomes a gladiator and, thanks to his training and military experience, quickly becomes one of the best. Finally, he returns to Rome, eager to avenge the tyrannical emperor who stole his life and family.Ok, this movie reminds me a lot of Ben Hur with all this story of revenge and injustice set in the Roman world, but let's talk first of what's good ... directed by Ridley Scott, has a good rhythm, no dead moments, and The director did a pretty good job. The script has an emotive story, with a coherent development that gives us strong and well developed characters. Russell Crowe did a good job and shines in the lead role in one of the films that shaped his career. Joaquin Phoenix also had one of the most remarkable films of his career here, giving his villain a ""rich narcissistic spoiled rich boy"" touch. Richard Harris made a good appearance in what would become one of his last film works. But the real good-bye to seventh art is Oliver Reed, giving life to Proximo, the head of the gladiator school. The prestigious actor passed away during the filming period. In the supporting cast, Djimon Hounsou and Connie Nielsen do a good job.However, the movie is not flawless. The film takes advantage of the names of two Roman emperors who actually existed and succeeded one after another. This turned out to be a problem ... in fact the lives of these two emperors have nothing to do with what this movie shows, and the use of names and contexts raises serious questions about likelihood and historical rigor. There are also some problems of lack of logic and credibility. Regarding the work of the actors, I negatively highlight the bad dialogues of this film, with absolutely cliché passages and excessive theatricality.At the technical level, the film uses and abuses CGI, the state of the art at the time, to provide us with breathtaking scenarios that bring to our time the exaggerated glory and monumentality of Ancient Rome. It would be hard to do better than this. The deeply epic soundtrack accentuates this monumentality and has become one of the best-selling and most famous soundtracks in contemporary cinema, in all fairness. The special and sound effects highlighted the brutality of the fighting quite well, while the sets and costumes correspond well to what we might expect in an epic movie this season.Unsurprisingly, and despite all the flaws, the film garnered five Academy Awards (Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Costume, Best Sound and Best Visual Effects) at the 2001 ceremony.",Gladiator

The casting was perfect, particularly on the parts of Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Both were startlingly convincing in their roles, and the fighting scenes were absolutely jaw-dropping. There's nothing like brutal violence to make your day complete, right?The only complaint that I have about Gladiator was that I think it was a little too long, but then again, the best movies are generally a bit longer than average. Even more than that, though, were the special effects. In my opinion, if something looks even the tiniest bit fake, then it becomes immediately obvious that the audience is being manipulated, and that takes so much away from the movie. This happened most clearly with the lions toward the end of Gladiator. As a whole, Gladiator was a spectacular film. It should not be missed by anyone (unless you have problems with seeing decapitations) and it will surely be added to Ridley Scott's respectable list of classics.

76,Vartiainen,Epic historical drama,10,13 January 2014,"What I love the most about this film is how it transports me directly to the Era of Ancient Rome in all of its glory. The sheer scope of this film is awe-inspiring, from the brutal battle scenes against the barbarians, to the slave markets of the Middle-East to the Colosseum of Rome. It all looks, sounds and feels real, and the era has never been more accurately represented.This is also one of Russell Crowe's crowning achievements. He fully disappears into the role of General Maximus, aptly portraying both the brilliant military leader, the anguished family man after revenge as well as the beacon of hope for the people of Rome. The story of Gladiator is his story, and a bad casting choice would have ruined the whole film. In this case it elevates it to a masterpiece territory.The rest of the actors do a fine job as well, though I've never quite gotten the appeal of Joaquin Phoenix, playing here the corrupted emperor Commodus. He's fine villain objectively, but I think he's perhaps a shade too slimy with very little charisma. I get that's the purpose, but I would have preferred a villain with a hint more backbone. Still, only a nitpick.Aside from that, it's an all-around great film with intense and well-choreographed fight scenes, interesting characters, high production values and great use of both music and colour.

80,freemantle_uk,Are you not entertained?,9,28 November 2008,"Some people claim that Braveheart is the best epic movie ever made: they are really wrong, and is one of the worst films ever made. Gladiator one the other hand is a very good movie, showing that Ridley Scott is a master film-making, showing that he can do any genre and helped make Russell Crowe into a true A-lister.Gladiator tells the story of Maximus Meridius (Russell Crowe), a Roman General who fought in the war against Germanian tribes. After a massive victory for the Roman, Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) and his children Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) arrive at the frontline. Marcus Aurelius doubts Commodus abilities to become Emperor and asks Maximus to protect Rome by bringing back the Republic and make the Senate powerful again. However before Maximus could do anything Commodus murders his father and arrests Maximus, planning to kill him. When Maximus he returns to his farm and finds his wife and son were murder and he gets captured by Commodus forces. He is sold into slavery and then a gladiator in a backwater in North Africa. In Rome Commodus decides to reintroduce gladiatorial contests in honour of his father who had banned them. Because of Maximus and his comrades success in North Africa they get a chance to fight in Rome. Maximus becomes so success that the people of Rome love him and becomes a challenge to the Emperor.What Gladiator does well is fight and battle scene. Scott brings in realistic violence which wasn't allowed during the golden age of sword and scandal epics. It's a gore fest, but its a good gore fest. The fights were brilliant. The battle scene at the beginning of film is one of the best ever in cinema, must better then anything in Braveheart. The battle was realistic, showing how the Roman army would have fought against a Barbarian army. Compare it to anything in Braveheart which was a farce in all respects. The acting in the film is top-notch. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix were on the top of their game and this film is an example of why they became a-listers. Oliver Reed offered the audience his swansong and even Omid Djalili offered a little light relief. As well Ridley Scott tries to show Commodus as a more human character, that he did have some redeemable features like his love for his nepthew. The characters are not completely good or completely evil. It doesn't try to moralise the issues. Compare to the God-awful Braveheart where they is no attempt to show the characters as human or realistic, and that all English characters were pure evil and all Scots were goodness and like. The film also had a solid script behind it, which is very quotable and has a good, classical story behind it. It has a old fashion feel to it, and Ridley Scott said that he was influenced by films like Ben-hur and Spartacus. This is one of my brother's favourite films.However, one of the big problems with the film is that one of the best scenes was right at the beginning of the film, similar to Saving Private Ryan, which means that nothing each can in the film can compare to it. As well, whilst most of the film is realist, they are some aspects which are not so realist, like when Tigris of Gaul enters into the Colosseum, but those thinks are minor and doesn't affect the enjoyment.I criticise Braveheart for its historical inaccuracies, but don't do the same with Gladiator. That's because Braveheart was pretending to be a historical film and telling the facts (it doesn't), Gladiator also set itself out to be a fictional story and nothing a rewrite of history.Whether Gladiator deserved to win all the Oscars it got is debatable, but it is a very entertaining film.",Gladiator
81,dfranzen70,Sandals in the wind,9,5 December 2000,"Ridley Scott attempted to do to sword-and-sandal pictures with this movie what James Cameron did for highfalutin disaster pics with Titanic. In other words, a bombastic, explicit, harrowing, no-holds-barred epic. And succeed the action auteur has.Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a loyal general in the Roman army. The Romans have conquered most of the civilized world, and there is only one outpost remaining. The stolid Maximus and his troops overtake the enemy, earning the grace of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). The dying Emperor calls his general to his bedside and tells him that when he's shuffled off this mortal coil, he wants Maximus to be the ""defender of Rome"" and the leadership of the empire to go not to his son but back to the long-abandoned Roman Senate. It's quite a radical plan for the Emperor to have, and Maximus, against his own wishes, consents. When the aged Aurelius dies, however, the plan changes. The  Emperor's snotty, belligerent son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) assumes command (which is easy, since he's the son and no one else knew of the Emperor's plans) and orders the execution of Maximus. The stunned general is led off, but naturally defeats his captors. He becomes a slave and is eventually sold to Proximus (Oliver Reed, in his final movie) and is forced to fight as a gladiator in arenas for the amusement of the aristocrats (severe shades of Spartacus!). And, of course, he must somehow win his freedom, get the girl (who happens to be Commodus' sister), and avenge the murders of his wife and son, which happened when he was to be executed.Crowe grips his sword with an unyielding passion, gladly taking up the mantle passed to him by such golden-boy icons as Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford. He's been touted as the Next Big Thing for a while now, but he seems like he'll be sticking around. Check him out in L.A. Confidential - or if you're in the mood for mediocre fluff, try Virtuosity with Denzel Washington. But Gladiator is the absolute pinnacle of Crowe's relatively brief career. The Aussie magnificently holds his own as an action star and still finds time to emote properly. (Ah, I'm such a sucker for a good emote!) Those of you who want to see him shirtless, you're in luck - however, in some of the scenes he's buried in some seriously huge and obtrusive armor.Crowe's Maximus is completely loyal to the empire, and it blows his mind that he could go from being so highly respected in the land to being a slave. But this is not a morality tale of how a well-off man must suffer so that he may know the less-fortunate; in fact, there's not much moralizing here (aside from the usual vengeance-shall-be-mine theme). Once he's escaped his executioners, Maximus adopts an attitude of grim determination. He's relentless in his goal - he MUST save Rome. This kind of character development we don't get to see much in action movies, and while the movie is exceptionally well written for such a genre film, it's really Crowe's show. A lesser actor might have grunted and grimaced his way through much of the dialogue, but Crowe was more than up to the task. This was a blockbuster at the box office, and with great reason. This might even be one for the ages. My policy is to never overpraise a film as a ""classic"" (or, worse yet, ""instant classic,"" as if you only needed to add water), so I'll restrain myself here. The best way to find out if a movie is a classic is to wait 20 years. This way you get a more subjective historical perspective on the film - who's to say that in 20 years we'll think of this film as a nostalgia piece of the early 2000's?",Gladiator
82,ianlouisiana,"""Infamy! Infamy!...they've all got it in for me!""",6,9 June 2007,"Along with many Ridley Scott films ""Gladiator"" is cleverly made,full of dialogue that at first hearing sounds deeper and and more meaningful than it actually is and comic - book characters. Up to the time of Marcelus's death it holds the interest well enough apart from Mr R.Harris's constant use of the word ""Ah!"" in order to convey ""irony"" ,and Mr R.Crowe's occasional lapse into his native ""strine"" isn't too grating and he's certainly handy with a sword.But the development of the role of Commodus (a name worthy of any ""Carry on"" movie)as the new Caesar (Mr J.Pheonix about as frightening as a baddie in ""Batman"")and the ousting of Mr Crowe signal a drastic change from a well - realised account of the conduct of the Roman Army in Northern Europe to a second - rate retread of ""Spartacus"". With bits liberally borrowed from ""Ben Hur"" and ""The fall of the Roman Empire"" and ""The Searchers"" via ""Star Wars"",Mr Scott's sources are impeccable,it's his execution that is disappointing. A few British TV actors appear as Senators and such,to very little effect I'm afraid,their over-familiarity does them or the movie no favours.Presumably ""Isn't that the bloke from Z Cars?"" was not the response Mr Scott was looking for. Where the movie scores is in the Special Effects department. The fight scenes are well - handled,the tigers being particularly impressive,but CGI alone do not a great movie make. The late Oliver Reed acts almost as if he knows ""Gladiator"" is going to be his last hurrah,it's all in his eyes,most of his dialogue is pretty banal.His leonine head held high with obvious effort,he gives the movie what little gravitas it possesses.His may have been a somewhat checkered career but he went out with all guns blazing.

83,PWNYCNY,There are not enough superlatives to describe this movie.,10,3 October 2010,"Some movies are made to be watched over and over again, that's how good they are. Gladiator is one of those movies. It has all the elements that makes for a good movie. There is a compelling story, an altruistic hero, a sinister villain, a damsel and her young son, excellent musical score, great cinematography, great support cast, strong dialog and a solid finale. The movie has become a Hollywood icon. Its characters have achieved legendary status. Jaoquin Phoenix is superb as the Emperor Commodus, who is reviled by everyone, including his own sister. (Yet this does not stop the indefatigable emperor from doing his paperwork.) Russell Crowe gives a tour-de-force performance as Maximus, the hero general who refuses to cave in to the vindicative and jealous emperor. Oliver Reed, in his final performance, is great as Maximus's friend and ally. The scenes in the Colosseum are spectacular; the Colosseum itself is shown in all of its grandeur, a fitting venue for the kinds of spectacles that became symbols of Roman decadence and cruelty. All in all, this is a wonderful movie, one that deservedly is a classic.The part of the movie where Maximus reveals himself to the emperor is one of the greatest scenes in the history of Hollywood cinema. This is the scene that every director strives for, dreams about and rarely attains. Ridley Scott must have felt great to have put together such a stunning and evocative scene. The corrupt emperor and his erstwhile general, facing off, in front of the crowd, witnessed by the Senate, and the emperor's sister, indeed, by the entire world. Wow! Now THAT'S entertainment!",Gladiator
84,dee.reid,Epic,10,2 December 2008,"""Gladiator"" is one of those films for the ages, a film that defies expectations and becomes something legendary. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for Best Actor as a Roman general seeking revenge on the corrupt prince (Joaquin Phoenix) who murdered his family. While a simple revenge dominates the plot, it really gives director Ridley Scott a chance to re-imagine ancient Rome as it was before its historical downfall. His vision is astounding, with plenty of graphic battle sequences (many of which are enhanced by CGI), great acting, and all-around epic greatness. ""Gladiator"" is really sweeping entertainment of the first order. While I feel I can no longer pay to see Russell Crowe in a movie anymore, this was his greatest performance ever, with an Oscar win that was surely well-deserved.10/10",Gladiator
85,JoeB131,The ending destroyed it for me,1,20 April 2010,"As a Roman History Buff, the ending destroyed it. You have the ending where the fictional Maximus kills Commodus (a real Roman Emperor) in gladiatorial combat. (Commodus was actually strangled in his bath when poison wasn't killing him fast enough.) The sister of Commedus, Lucilla (who had actually been executed at the beginning of Commedus' reign) announces that we are all going to honor Maximus and restore the Republic.For a Roman history buff, this is like saying World War II was Hitler giving us all Ice Cream.What actually happened was that after Commedus (who wasn't that bad of a guy, really) Rome went into an embarrassing period known as the ""Year of the Five Emperors, where a decent man was assassinated, the office of emperor was auctioned off, and three rival generals launched a civil war.This is universally agreed to be the tipping point of Rome's inevitable decline.",Gladiator

It is not inside confidential information anymore, Russell Crowe is not just a fine actor but now he is a big star. His performance as the gladiator was subtle, but yet, powerful.

87,mjneu59,Ridley Scott's artificial epic isn't very impressive,3,22 November 2010,"Ridley Scott's Oscar-winning ersatz epic is one of the least spectacular big-screen spectacles ever sold to an undemanding public: a sand-and-sandal throwback stripped of the genre's all too necessary guilty pleasures. The idea was to recreate for today's digital generation a wide-screen Roman Empire costume drama from Hollywood's pre-video adolescence, but all the fancy computer imagery (and state-of-the-art budget) only makes the new film look and sound more solemn and pompous than its beefcake role models. Worse yet, the occasional token nod toward old-fashioned visual grandeur isn't enough to camouflage the claustrophobic TV screen compositions and typically frantic Madison Avenue editing job (designed, perhaps, to hide the digital wrinkles).Russell Crowe is the title character: a Roman general fallen from imperial favor, battling for his life and honor on the floor of the Coliseum, where the prize for victory is another day of slavery and the cost of defeat is a mercifully quick death. Crowe's protagonist is a man of few words, most of them delivered in a flat monotone, matching the equally colorless photography, shaded in picturesque hues of misty gray and mud brown sepia.Don't expect any surprises from the strictly formula riches-to-rags-to-rebel hero scenario, which doesn't even allow the villains (degenerate emperor Joaquin Phoenix and his sister/lover Connie Nielson) a chance to have any fun. Audiences (and too many critics, who should have known better) conditioned by habit to reject anything original made the film a worldwide hit, but even in our current age of diminished expectations it should have been clear that they don't make 'em like they used to anymore.",Gladiator
88,drqshadow-reviews,"Ridley Scott's Ancient Revenge Fantasy is a Burner, Through and Through",10,21 July 2020,"A number of giant, career-making performances (plus another impressive turn in the director's chair for Ridley Scott) fuel this rich, hard-hitting saga of betrayal, grief and revenge in imperial Rome. The dueling fates of Maximus (Russell Crowe) and Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) share the front and center, twin note-perfect parts that continuously clash over the spotlight, but dozens of supporting players also deserve recognition. Richard Harris as the guilt-ridden sage, Marcus Aurelius. Oliver Reed chewing scenery as a grizzled, cynical combatant-turned-slaver. Djimon Hounsou and Ralf Moeller, comrades in arms who convey an intimate, crucial sense of kinship. As an intensely emotion-driven story, Gladiator can't function without this level of acting power. In less capable hands, it might be laughed off the screen. With Crowe, Phoenix and company in command - and, again, Scott there to expertly piece it all together amid an appropriately epic score by Hans Zimmer - we're swept off our feet.It's an enveloping film; a thick flood of sights, sounds and moods. We marvel over the bustling Roman Colosseum, tense our muscles in the raging chaos of battle, find peace in the metaphor of golden wheat fields as an afterlife. Maximus's justified outrage becomes our own, Commodus (with his barely-contained mania) our bane, and once it's got those hooks in, the script doesn't give an inch. An exceptionally powerful production, damn near perfect in all respects.",Gladiator
89,CubsandCulture,"The script is saved by Crowe, Reed and the action scenes",7,12 February 2019,"Somewhere alone the way of writing this story each of the writers seemingly made each section more direct and clearer. Unfortunately, they ended up going way too far. The script doesn't have much, if any, subtext. There is a brutal directness in the writing that makes the film cheesy in its obviousness. Some of this might be intentional because story is very much one of blunt masculinity. Further, some the choices made in regards to the history are just laughably bad. No Rome did not become a republic again in 180 AD (or whatever). Commodus is made far to much of a coward as well. The script is very poorly executed through at least the board outlines of the story is quite good.But the movie is largely saved by Scott's direction. The story is a big dumb slice of blood sport and machismo; the visuals know this and lean into these aspects. Scott directions the actions scenes withe glee. The MTV style editing is recognizably early 2000's but it works extremely well in this film. Likewise, the less pristine and grimier visuals really fit Rome as a symbol of corruption. This is probably the best movie that could have been rung out of the script.Scott is greatly aided by Crowe, Reed and Phoenix. While all are a bit too pitched to be truly great, each of them turn in electrifying performances that patch up the script. Crowe gets emotion from the cheesiest and cliche lines. Phoenix manages to make a flat villain feel much more rounded (especially in the extended cut) and human. But Reed is absolutely the standout. Proximo is THE lovable rogue of the 2000's. Reed gives a performance of such glee and relish that he really helps you embrace the weaknesses of the script as charms.Should never have been in the Best Picture race but this film has aged well.",Gladiator

Top notch acting, an opening battle scene that almost does for that time period what Saving Private Ryan did for WW2 - it recreates the sheer horror inflicted by the Roman Army. Later, the actual gladiator scenes in Rome are also convincingly portrayed. The cerebral elements where we follow the moral strengths and weaknesses of the characters give it more substance than a mere action movie. Its main weakness is probably that which most big Hollywood epics have had - no more than a passing attempt to use the film as an art form - this, as the gladiator organizer says, is entertainment. (Note - from the little history I've been able to glean, the storyline - who kills who - seems to be largely fiction, although the portrayal of the characters of the main players seems reasonable enough and the other details are apparently quite well constructed. So we get quite a reasonable picture of the Empire in this context if we ignore the plot. Perhaps some historians reading this will want to add details about the lives and deaths of Marcus Aurelius, Maximus and Commodus just to keep the record straight.)",Gladiator

Scott's ""Gladiator"" is build around a mythic character, a man trying to find his way home... It is around someone finding inner strength in a tough time Maximus is somebody who doesn't want to be a soldier We realize this is a man who is pursuing the ultimate which is transcending death and finding love after death which completely transforms your reaction to the man, a man who is very, very strong but very, very loving The plot, familiar from Anthony Mann's "" Fall of the Roman Empire,"" had Crowe as Maximus, the proud well-loved Roman general in the army of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Maximus whose motto is 'Strength and Honor' is like a son to Aurelius, a statement that left Aurelius' own son, Commodus perturbed...Disappointed by the news that his father privately decides to name Maximus his successor, and being a young ambitious son lusting for power, he murders his father, and orders a strike against the general... One of the best scenes of the motion picture is where Commodus is told by his father that he is not going to be the emperor Joaquin Phoenix is easy to hate in a frightening and vile character...Ridley Scott creates a lot of beautiful scenes between the characters He did some fantastic work in all of those wonderful scenes in the film But there's another moment between the emperor and his daughter Lucilla (the Danish beauty Connie Nielsen) that I loved very much Harris says, ""Let's not speak of politics. Let us pretend that you are a loving daughter and I'm a good father. "" They walk for a few seconds and Lucilla says, ""This is a pleasant fiction."" I felt this short scene so sophisticated It seemed to me wonderfully insightful, simple in terms of amount of words, but complex in terms of understanding this strange relationship One of the most successful bits of casting was Oliver Reed He's a harsh and rough businessman who makes his living off the death machine and yet, inside, there was some kind of ethical person that would come out at the right momentRidley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall...

Super fun watching this again, it's just the classic sword & sandal flick, epic on all counts and the type of movie that stays with you for days afterwards. Admittedly the story was also a bit draggy in parts, its almost 3 hours long and at times I was confused as to where it was taking place Morocco? but the location issue is just me.Russell Crowe is Oscar worthy as he embodies Maximus. Perfect as the strong and silent leader, the type of character you feel for and can't help but cheer along especially as he's squaring off against the awesomely crazy & creepy Joaquin Phoenix ""You will love me and bear me a pure heir"" -spoken to his sister. Phoenix was just amazing.Of course the battle scenes are awesome; exciting, bloody and epic, starting in Germany with Russell as a Roman general leading his men into battle. He soon arouses the rage of the emperors jealous and bloodthirsty son when it becomes known that Maximus is to be the successor. A bit of murder happens then with Maximus finding himself a widower, beaten, enslaved and forced to become a gladiator.

95,Cristi_Ciopron,"Cinematography, music, performances, violence",8,24 August 2008,"Few actors are interesting as persons, by what they have to say individually, in private, offscreen. I would name Rourke, Brando, Clift, Crowe. On the other hand, several firsthand actors are eminently uninteresting as personalitiesDe Niro, Pacino, Hopkins, Newman, Willis, Bogart,I have found myself missing Crowe's roles that I already knew. He is a typical example of an actor better than the movies he's inlike Pacino, like Gabin and De Niro for the most part of their careers. He is worth more than his movies.I like the ample, colossal battles scenes (and CNN's best -- and worst -- movie battle scenes list ). The scenes of enormous crowds, of hosts and hoards, of unnumbered armies .The battle scenes make the epics (in the conventional sense). There's no true epic without those battle scenes. Sometimes, it's a perspective, an angle; most often, it's slapdash and exploitation. They give the thrills. The tumult, the excitement, the manly fierceness, too often the highly idealized rendering of the battle's thrills (where realism means gore, but not cowardice, physiology, stupidity, irrational things, confusion, fear, chaos, arbitrary moves, etc.).The battle with the Germanic tribes at the beginning of GLADIATOR is good and impressing and a strong visual experience (though not as copious as deemed by some to beone would have liked moremore of everything in that battle). GLADIATOR is a thrilleri.e., an adventure story, well paced and extremely aware of corporeality, of a happy and athletic one, and of the bodily, manly and physical world. This is the core of a thriller. By its high violence, its large amount of brutality, strikingly featured, it has also a side of decadence. It is suspenseful, inventive, luring.Crowe is not an unsubtle actor; moreover, he's better than Depp, Pitt, and even than Willis, and finer than Spacey. Very endowed, gifted, and very intelligent also. His finest roles have that brio given by the intelligence alone. GLADIATOR is a considerable thrillerextraordinarily scored, acted, filmed. By its inner nature and trend, it is a thriller. I am in a phase when Crowe is (again, but differently) very important to my notions of cinema. I am eager of each Crowe role. The artificiality brought by the CGI suits somehow, if properly used, the cinema's natureI mean the technical artificialities.As a footnote, I consider GLADIATOR was a notable influence on Gibson's religious masterpiecefor the violence, the cruelty, the military brutality, the harsh barbarianism. Way ago, when directors showed violence and brutality, they were aware of doing something sordid, nasty and dirty; but now, they do it with the conscience of doing something grand, epic, even noble. This is the change: the ennoblement of violence on an epic scale. Largerthanlife violence, shown with a clean conscience and with a sort of clean technical pride. Rehabilitating violence on screen.Crowe, with his bitter, manly, intelligent smile.Crowe was right that most of the lineshis, the others' are utter crap. But the performances are unexpectedly good. Of course, Crowe absolutely dominates the movie, and his role might be the best performance ever in this (revisited, reformed, reshaped, reconfigured) genre of movies.It is interesting that once the emperor Marcus was harshly judged for his failure with his son this was hold against him, and nowadays one would consider absurd, unfitting to evaluate Sartre or another such modern philosophers for their failure to live up to their standards. This shows how things have changed, and not for the worseand how the honest quest for wisdom, and for wisdom in each practical aspect, was replaced with the quest for an invalid wisdom masquerading for something else and practically undermining itself.",Gladiator

99,slokes,Do You Like Movies About Gladiators?,7,15 June 2004,"Once upon a time, Hollywood made lots of movies like this, with ""Quo Vadis?"" ""Ben Hur"", and ""Sparticus"" springing most quickly to mind. Then the space age arrived, and sword & sandal epics became as passé as the western.Fortunately, Ridley Scott and a talented team of writers figured out a new way to breathe life in the old formula, with the help of CGI and a talented leading man. Frankly, the story of Maximus, a toppled Roman general who reclaims his political clout in the ring of gladiatorial combat, is a little thin when you think about it. But it's delivered with a lot of panache and visual flair.Russell Crowe isn't too multi-dimensional, but he's more than adequate in the role of Maximus, tender at times but more a gloomy muscleman. He's interesting, even brilliant in flashes, like when he finds the dead bodies of his wife and son, but he doesn't engage you enough to fret overmuch over his fate. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the best performance as the mad Roman emperor Commodus, ""vexed"" as he is by Maximus's reappearance but trying in his own sad way to be noble and loving. At times Phoenix seems to be channeling Malcolm McDowell, though not the time McDowell actually played an emperor in the nasty ""Caligula.""Speaking of British film stars of the 1960s/1970s, there are three of them in this film, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris, and David Hemmings, all of whom are now dead just four years after the picture's release. This amounts to something of a swan song for all of them, a fitting one as it turns out. Reed especially has his moments. Connie Nielsen presents us with both regal sexiness and hurt-stained eyes as Commodus's sister Lucilla, Maximus's former lover who clearly carries a torch still.We wait for Maximus and Lucilla to take up again where they left off, now that Maximus is single again, but the film reminds us time and again that Maximus's loyalty to his family extends beyond death, that he believes he will see them again in the afterlife. This spiritual dimension, unexpected from a film set in pagan times, lifts the film in my mind to the point where it really clicked with a lot of audiences. It also sets up Crowe's best bits of dialogue in the second half of the movie.Of course, there are some amazing fight scenes as well, in the Colisseum and other gladiator venues as well as Germania, where we are introduced to Maximus putting down a barbarian rebellion. The combat scenes are where the CGI work and other special effects especially shine, with a fight between Maximus and his cohorts against a squad of charioteers making for one heady adrenaline rush.But Maximus's followers are never adequately developed as people worth caring about. Also half-baked is some intrigue involving Lucilla and some Roman senators, including Derek Jacobi, who needs to be wearing a toga like Clint Eastwood does a cowboy hat. The crowd reactions to Maximus, especially when they suddenly recognize him en masse as the lost general who had never visited Rome and chant his name to spare him from Commodus's fury, cries out as obvious plot convenience. These aren't major flaws, but they do stick out on repeat viewings. 'Gladiator,' like many spectacles ancient and modern, never quite satisfies as well as it does the first time you see it.All in all, I have a hard time accepting this as the 2000 Best Picture Oscar winner, especially over ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" which is a more amazing feast for the senses and a better story besides. But 'Gladiator' is a good film, something more than your average blockbuster, and worthy watching.",Gladiator

A great mix of drama and action with political schemes and battle scenes. The acting was very good all around with character actors like Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. Joaquin Phoenix was a good antagonist and Russel Crowe gave a commanding presence as the lead delivering a powerful performance that won him a richly deserved Oscar for best actor. I remember seeing this at the theater and it completely blew away Mel Gibson's weak attempt to relive the glory of Braveheart with the failed(and very lame) epic The Patriot. Gladiator comes really close to being as good as Braveheart and at times is also very bloody. Gladiator is also bloody good and is well put together all around.

I hope the movie does well and I am glad it got made.  I cannot say it left me breathless or awestruck, but I enjoy it.",Gladiator
104,Steffi_P,"""There was a dream that was Rome""",8,12 March 2012,"Historical epics set in the classical antiquity were a cinematic staple for a long period in the post war era. The genre died a death in the mid-60s, and even though big historical pictures did crop up from time to time, the Sword-and-Sandal format of Ben Hur and Spartacus seemed vanished. That is, until Gladiator. All at once, the vast ancient-world movie was back. Hollywood and the cinema-going public welcomed it with open arms.Of course, movies don't quite look the same now as they once did. One of the biggest changes in cinema since then is not one of style but one of logistics. Back in the 1950s you could put out a call for a few thousand men, give them all a free meal and a tin hat, and hey presto, you had an army. Now, every extra must be paid properly and you just can't afford masses of them. That extras are getting their due is a good thing, but it has changed the way we make movies. It's one of the reasons why CGI became so widespread – it's essentially a cheap option. However with Gladiator, Ridley Scott has done something Cecil B. DeMille used to do during The Great Depression, back when he was the only person mad enough to make epics in that cash-strapped era. He employs a mix of rapid editing and obscure cinematography to make it look like there's a lot more in the frame than there really is*. It's a neat trick and it works fairly well in battle and crowd scenes. The only trouble is the style is used for much of the picture, and it is somewhat tiresome to see a simple dialogue scene chopped up into a bewildering mess of shaky close-ups.Back in the Sword-and-Sandal heyday there were certain actors who were associated with the genre. Now that the format was being revived, it would be a gamble finding their modern equivalents. Luckily, I can't think of any contemporary player better than Russell Crowe for this job. He has that rugged tough-guy look, but with a quiet dignity that is absolutely in tune with the notion of Romans as civilized warriors. While his performance does not have any exceptional moments, its strength is in his overall embodiment of the character of Maximus, convincing us that he is every inch a general who leads from the front. Also very good is Oliver Reed, bringing a bit of old-style presence to the proceedings, and a slightly pervy Joaquin Phoenix.There is one final big difference between Gladiator and its predecessors. The older epics were almost always religious movies, with stories taken from the bible or the days of the early Christians. However, where those '50s pictures were religious, Gladiator is spiritual. There are no miracles or grandiose sermons here, just one man's very fervent belief in an afterlife. And while this is still just a piece of mythology, its context here – the hope of reunion with his murdered family – is incredibly touching, and is effectively what binds the whole movie together. In fact, Gladiator is arguably the first epic to achieve what so many of the earlier examples strove so hard to be – an epic that is also intimate.*Note that there is some CGI in Gladiator, but it's relatively minimal and is even comparable to the use of matt paintings in those '50s epics.",Gladiator
105,rbverhoef,"Great, most of it",9,21 September 2003,"I have seen 'Gladiator' a couple of times now and I still think it is a very good movie. But the more you see it, the more you notice little flaws. The story is about a general Maximus (Russell Crowe) who is chosen by emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) to become protector of Rome after his death. Instead he becomes a slave because the son of the emperor, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), kills his father before anybody knows his wish. Maximus is sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) and he trains gladiators. Maximus has to make the crowd love him to make it to the Colosseum, to face Commodus who thinks Maximus is dead. Most of the story is fictional.There are a lot of good things in this movie and they almost make you forget the bad things. The movie opens with a battle between the army of general Maximus and a Germanian army. The set-up is great. We see how the Roman army is preparing for battle, with a lot of little details, and how the Germanian army arrives at the battlefield. After this the actual battle is a disappointment. Where everything looked great right before it all started, you can hardly see anything during the battle. Here the editing, cinematography and even direction or not very good. The only thing that is still great are the costumes. I admired them in every shot of the movie.After this the real story, the one I told you above, begins. Most of the things from here on are very good. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who is Commodus' sister Lucilla and an old love of Maximus, are very good as well and veterans as Derek Jacobi (as Senator Gracchus), the late Oliver Reed and the late Richard Harris simply disappear in their characters. The animated Rome looks great and new in one way but therefor a little too perfect, too animated, in another way. The battles in the arenas are pretty good, although the last one is a little too much fiction. You will know what I mean. The ending is the one you expect, a real Hollywood ending, but it doesn't spoil the movie.Last but not least I want to mention the music by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. This is one of those scores you will remember. It is perfect in every scene of the movie. This beautiful score, great acting, a fine direction by Ridley Scott and some exciting battles make this movie very entertaining and still one of the best movies of 2000.",Gladiator
106,truemythmedia,An Epic for the New Millenium,10,21 August 2019,"Epics from the Roman period have always been a love of mine. This movie came out when I was first starting to spread my wings and see movies on my own for the first time. The film is extravagant, violent, and features a brilliant performance by Joaquin Phoenix (""You Were Never Really Here""), who would become a favorite actor of mine.In short, this film was made for me.This review is about to start sounding like a rave but there is just no hiding my love for this film. I have seen this movie so many times i can quote it in my sleep, I can describe the pacing beats of certain scenes and combats, and relate to you the moments in which the audience gasped during my first viewing. It is that ingrained into my film watching psyche.The first place this film excels is in the production design. There are few movies who can boast the subtle boldness of the design in this film. Smashed together, we have Emperor Commodus in the most elaborate luxury, almost to the standard of a fantasy epic, and the dirty, beaten slaves, bedraggled military, and conquered hordes. The Colosseum of Rome, raining down rose petals, next to the backwater communities of Rome.The armor, the clothing, and the buildings do not even seem to attempt to be realistic but rather, play up the theatricality of Rome, its politics, and its entertainment. The stage being set in this way prepares the audience for the themes of the film which center around virtue and honor versus spectacle and show.The show they bring us is no slouch either. The action set pieces in ""Gladiator"" are second to none and no tow are the same. Ridley Scott brings us a variety of combat unparalleled in film. He brings us Roman military actions and formations, one on one combats, two on one combats, 5 on 1 combats, chariots vs ground troops, ferocious beasts, political assassinations, executions, and finally, the Emperor vs a Gladiator.In ""Gladiator,"" Scott explores the many forms of violence which took place in the ancient world and the ways that they were used to both thrill audiences and strike fear into the hearts of Rome's enemies. The film not only exploits violence to keep its viewers interested, it is used to show us why it was such a powerful force to reckon with.The final point I will touch on here is the acting. Russell Crowe (""LA Confidential"") is fine in the movie. I don't think he does anything super remarkable but he plays it well. The real show here is in the performance of Joaquin Phoenix.Certainly one of the best actors of our day, this was Joaquin's debut performance and he does everything he can to make you hate the Emperor Commodus. His sniveling licking of wounds, vicious threats, patricide, incest, cheating, and conniving create a villain so distasteful that you hang on his every word to hear what horrible new thought has made its way down to his lying lips.Without a powerful performance such as Phoenix delivers here, the actions of the Emperor might seem outlandish, too large and grandiose, to be taken seriously. When performed well, as here, it causes audiences to catch their breath when someone speaks a poorly chosen word in his presence for fear of what despicable torture Commodus will devise for them.Clearly, I love this film and, as you have probably seen it already as well, I am sure you do too. It is one of those rare gems of a film which I know almost no one who does not care for it. If you aren't one for violence this movie is a pass but for anyone else, I have a hard time imagining how you could not enjoy ""Gladiator.""",Gladiator

109,Spleen,"Take ""Spartacus"" and subtract: beauty, heroism, intelligence, competent editing ...",5,13 August 2000,"I love ancient world epics.  Before seeing ""Gladiator"" I didn't think it was possible to make one that isn't worth watching; and, indeed, Ridley Scott hasn't done so either, although he certainly seems to have tried, and his film certainly is bad.  For a film set in Rome at its most magnificent there's remarkably little spectacle (and what little there is is largely computer-generated - appallingly).  For a film so reliant on fighting the combat scenes are confusingly, ineptly, MORONICALLY, shot and edited. Scott's latest fascination is with triple-framing.  Every moment of combat looks as if it was lit by a stroboscopic lamp.  This, plus occluded angles of view, over-use of extreme telephoto lenses, and rapid, more or less random editing - all combine to make it next to impossible to tell what the hell's going on.  How I miss the clean, clear spectacle of ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben-Hur"".  The other thing I miss is a score by Alex North or (better still) Miklós Rózsa.  Hans Zimmer's music (think of ""Crimson Tide"", but more minimalist, more new-agey, less tuneful) is horribly out of place (and just not very good); it combines with the stupid camera-work to make the whole film play like a music video - or a 154-minute trailer for something else.Well, not entirely.  Every so often - not VERY often, mind you - some STORY coalesces out of the cinematic debris, and some grandeur rises above the digital fog.  As I said: is it even POSSIBLE to make an ancient world epic in which this never happens?  But such moments are rare, and usually undercut by some conceit of Scott's.  They never last very long.I'm amused (I know people tend to say they're amused when they're really annoyed; okay, perhaps I'm also annoyed) by those who say that this is a story of simple heroism, unsuited for cynics.  The reverse is true.  If you're more cynical than I am you'll probably like the film better.  Two instances:(1)  When Lucilla meets Maximus in his cell, the latter has suddenly become the most cynical, world-weary, why-bother person on the planet; he refuses to so much as lift a finger to help Rome despite the fact that he has nothing to lose, and despite the fact that quest Lucilla offers him neatly coincides with everything he's been dreaming of for the past year or so. Where did THAT come from?  I'm sure that one of the bullet points in ""Screenwriting for Dummies"" is: ""make your hero a reluctant hero""; although I expect they go on to add, ""but not reluctant to the point of selfish petulance"".(2)  Commodus threatens to kill Lucius unless Lucilla betrays all the good guys.  Well and good.  But then we cut IMMEDIATELY to shots of the consequences of Lucilla's betrayal, and it becomes clear that we were meant to infer that Lucilla would, of course, turn traitor - Scott didn't think it worthwhile to show us what Lucilla's response was.  The possibility that she would make a sacrifice for the cause she knows to be right is not meant to even OCCUR to us.  (And it's not as if her character is so clearly defined that we have any idea how she, in particular, will act.  It's clearly meant to be a GENERAL LAW that nobody makes noble sacrifices.)The last point reminds me how poorly defined ALL the characters are.  Some blame the acting, or the dialogue, for this, but there's nothing wrong with either: in fact, most of the lines are stirring - ""corny"", my foot - and impeccably delivered.  The problem lies deeper.  ""Gladiator"" has a disjointed, stitched-together script filmed by a director with no clear idea of what it was meant to be about.P.S.: Surprisingly many people, including professional critics who should know better, have exhumed the mouldering old chestnut about how bloody modern cinema is the modern equivalent of the Ancient World's bloody gladiatorial combat.  Some even think that when Maximus cries out, ""Are you not entertained?"", he's talking to us.  Well, Scott's film is stupid in many ways, but this isn't one of them.  Cinema is FICTION: it wouldn't appeal to us if it weren't.  Gladiatorial combat was REAL: it wouldn't have appealed to the ancients if it weren't.  Modern sport, and modern documentaries, are much closer to being modern equivalents of gladiatorial combat; but why suppose there IS a modern equivalent?",Gladiator

The production would have cost 1/200 of the ""Gladiator"" budget, and you would have left the cinema feeling as silly and empty, but not as cheated, as after seeing this ""white elephant"". Unfortunately, this never-ending melodrama has been hailed as a masterpiece by the lovers of over-amplified sound effects, boringly fake visuals and gratuitous violence; and as in a Roman circus, it has been crowned with awards that make it look worst than it is.

With such a lofty budget, it could have been one of the industries biggest flops. Thankfully the final realization was a wonderment of cinema and mixing some of the old time great actors, with the dynamic new. Scott at the helm was pretty much the ideal choice and certainly only a handful of directors could have pulled off, such an exciting, emotional roller coaster.

114,Kingslaay,An epic film like no other,9,28 March 2017,"Gladiator is a great experience to the film viewer. It is a beautiful and well told story that keeps you intrigued and at the edge of your seat from start to finish. A great cast, story, visual effects and soundtrack are the right ingredients for this iconic film. The story is simply mesmerizing and beautifully told of a respected General who became a slave, who became a Gladiator, and, who then won the praise of many and defied the evil emperor. Just as the spectators in the Coliseum cheer for Maximus so does the viewer as you support his vengeance and justice. Justice against an evil Emperor who killed his family and wants to prevent a Rome governed by the people. The dream that was once Rome as envisioned by his great late father is pushed aside for his selfish wishes. The fights he organizes in the Coliseum are to distract the people as he knows too well that Rome is not the Emperor or the Senate but the mob. Little does he know that soon Maximus will return as a Gladiator to defy him and win the praise of the mob.The final moments are simply masterful. The scene showing Gladiator about to be reunited with his wife and son in the next life and him reaching out to this before he falls is probably one of the best scenes in film history. The soundtrack is simply epic and transports you easily to a time when Gladiators battled in ancient Rome. Hans Zimmer has outdone himself with his work and it works perfectly with some great scenes.Russell Crowe's Gladiator won the hearts of many in the film as I am sure this film won the hearts of many of its viewers.",Gladiator
115,lewiskendell,"The very definition of ""epic"".",8,17 July 2010,"""The beating heart of Rome is not the marble of the Senate. Its the sand of the Colisseum. He'll bring them death, and they will love him for it.""Gladiator ignited or rekindled a fascination with historical epics for a lot of people, and rightfully so. It hearkens back to movies like Spartacus and The Ten Commandments, sweeping and grand film events that go all out in taking you back to a specific time and place.It's a very good movie. The story of a once great man who is stripped of his family and his honor and left with nothing but his desire for revenge and the gladiatorial arena, is simple and powerful. But there are two real reasons why Gladiator works so well: Russell Crowe is the perfect Maximus, and the sets are absolutely awe-inspiring. This is the closest to seeing ancient Rome that any of us will ever get, and if you weren't impressed by Commidus's entry to Rome or the scenes in the Colisseum, I don't know what WOULD impress you. Each building and battle rings of authenticity and attention to detail. Crowe gives a believability to Maximus that many actors wouldn't have been able to pull off half as well. He makes Maximus seem a man who truly would inspire awe among the public and his followers, and jealousy from those who feel threatened by him. There were several notable performances from this cast, but Crowe stands above them all. It's still his finest role, in my opinion.Gladiator is the best movie that Ridley Scott has made since Blade Runner. It's impressive in all aspects, and completely deserves the lofty reputation that it has.",Gladiator
116,screenman,Pretentious and Mediocre,6,6 January 2008,"Evaluating opinion of this movie by the 'Hated It' selection, I lost count of the number of contributors who gave it just one star. I thought they were being unnecessarily 'Roman' in their ruthlessness, but the result does show how disappointed so many viewers were and the extent to which this movie has polarised opinion.I diplomatically place myself somewhere in the middle.For me, scepticism set-in at the outset. That much-vaunted battle scene didn't sit right at all. In combat, the greatest Roman strength lay in the legion. The scrupulously drilled and disciplined foot-soldiers worked in unison, advancing upon enemies in their orderly units and maniples.Their Shields interlocked to create a mobile wall that could form-up on all flanks and even provide overhead protection. In between, they used their short, stabbing swords.The legions, then, were only at their best in the open. In dense forest, their advantages would have been squandered, any fight being a brawl upon the same terms as the enemy. Morover, their big Shields would have been an encumbrance and the short swords inadequate. A good Roman general drew the enemy out to fight on his terms, not the other way round. I'm not a scholar of Roman warfare; it may be there were occasions when Romans had no choice, but this is where the question marks began to pop-up. Check out the impeccable piece in 'Spartacus', where the Roman legions deploy by the textbook, drawing their enemy down from the hill. Perhaps Mr Scott felt that a more faithful rendering would seem like too much of a rip-off. In any case, this battle is quite incidental, and seems to exist only to grip the viewer's attention for the next couple of flatulent hours.Neither was I aware that the Roman army employed fire-bombs. It's not for me to say they didn't, but I have no reference to this tactic at all.I thought Ridley Scott made a futile attempt to create an 'arty' film. The frequent dream-like flashbacks to a hand running through spears of corn reminded me of the recurrent unicorn dream from his fascinating but equally pretentious 'Blade Runner'. From time to time there's even the same high-pitched warbling 'oriental' chorus, intended to project mood, but failing again. Some directors don't seem to realise that cinema-goers have memories.General Gruntus Maximus (Russel Crowe) surely got the easiest Oscar in history. He was believable as an uneducated slob in the way, perhaps, Spartacus should have been; but cerebral enough to be a general? I don't think so. And you don't rise to be a career general in an army whilst obsessing as a farmer about your harvest. You're either one, or the other.There was one particularly absurd scene in the arena when he was chopping-down competitors as quickly as they could be set against him. What then - weren't they trained gladiators, too? I was half-expecting him to begin walking sideways along the arena walls like 'Neo' from 'Matrixus'.As to the 'spectacle' of Rome; well, that was all just computer-generated hokum. The back-room boys can whip-up anything in that way now just by tapping a few keys, so what's the big deal? Check-out the 'real' thing in 'Fall Of The Roman Empire'.As with 'Titanic' and 'Pearl Harbour' a splendid opportunity was missed here to do something really wonderful, but because of flawed vision and misplaced directorial self-belief we finished up with mediocrity. Glorious mediocrity.Still, bread and circuses usually please the crowds.",Gladiator

The battle sequences in the beginning are great not only in every detail in close-up plans but also in general view ones. The sound track is fabulous in some scenes. The story is intensely dramatic and well conceived. Of course historic truth is not respected nor it had to be. The artist is not a historian and when he inspires himself in History to make his work he doesn't need to follow truth in every detail providing he doesn't change historical spirit or commits grave falsehood. The artist is a creator not an imitator. His allegiance is to aesthetic values not to historical superficial truth. We know for instance that Commodus was killed by his friends and his concubine Martia and not by a gladiator who was a former general, in the arena, like in the movie but we also know that he was a tyrannical despot and he liked gladiator fights very much, having in fact taken part personally in some of them.

123,sme_no_densetsu,The general who became a slave. The slave who became a gladiator. The gladiator who defied an emperor.,8,30 June 2009,"Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" tells the story of a betrayed Roman general (Russell Crowe) who is thrust into the life of a gladiator. He lives for the day that he can exact revenge on the man responsible for the murder of his wife and child, the emperor himself (Joaquin Phoenix).The film harks back to the sort of big-budget historical epics that died out in the mid-sixties. Therefore, it isn't surprising that the script's strength isn't originality. The plot borrows elements of ""Ben-Hur"" & ""Spartacus"" and supposedly also draws heavily from ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"", which I haven't seen.Regardless of this lack of originality, the film does manage to present us with a compelling story of a type that had been absent from movie screens for too long. Also, with the advances in CGI, the filmmakers were able to fully realize the epic scope that such a story deserves. While the script may misstep a few times it nevertheless presents an intelligent story effectively balancing action and political intrigue.The cast is solid. Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his work here, which is a bit surprising to me. It's a good performance as far as action-oriented drama goes, but I don't think that it's outstanding by any means. I think that Joaquin Phoenix fared better as the conniving emperor but he only managed an Oscar nomination among some tough competition. The rest of the cast is generally above-average, featuring a number of talented individuals like Djimon Hounsou & Richard Harris.Ridley Scott's direction is skillfully handled and resulted in a well-deserved Oscar nomination. The attractive cinematography & crisp editing were also recognized with Oscar nominations. The visual effects deservedly won an Oscar, as did the costume design, while the art direction scored another Oscar nomination. These plaudits should make it clear that this is a film showing considerable care in all areas of visual presentation.A further Oscar nomination resulted from Hans Zimmer's score while the sound design scored another Oscar win. Very rarely do I notice sound design in a film but in this case I did.I'd say that, more than anything, the high quality of every technical aspect of the film went a long way in securing the film's Best Picture Oscar win. As for my own opinion, I think that the film represents a rare commodity: A crowd-pleasing film that also shows considerable technical prowess.",Gladiator
124,MR_Heraclius,Great,10,24 February 2020,"Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!""",Gladiator
125,Howlin Wolf,Brings new meaning to the word 'epic'...,9,12 March 2001,"It's been a while since we've had a blockbuster live up to the hype. This did, despite there being little hype to speak of originally. Now everyone is talking about it, and with good reason. The cast and crew have turned in a fine film.Crowe is magnificent as the central figure of Maximus. Along with an imposing figure, he brings acting skill to the role when many would have simply been tempted to essay the 'action hero' caricature we've seen many times before. Crowe is wonderfully competent at being both the classic 'hero' type and the man with a bit more depth behind the brawn. This role must surely have taken him to the front ranks of Hollywood's leading men.Many of the other cast members perform extremely well too. Joaquin Phoenix delivers the sort of complex interpretation a figure of history such as Commodus doubtless deserves. No matter how much we may be rooting for Maximus, occasionally we feel sympathetic towards Commodus when he is at his most pitiful. This is a fine balance though, as never is any pity we may feel allowed to overshadow the fact that Commodus can also be spectacularly evil. I shall be watching the career of Phoenix more closely on the evidence of this performance.(POSSIBLE SPOILERS)Often, the efforts of the actresses go unnoticed in relation to their more high profile male counterparts. Not here, Connie Nielsen is also superb as a quiet heroine who the audience can will to get together with the hero.Oliver Reed is fine in his last role, but it is Richard Harris, who, as a member of the 'old guard', reminds us all that he's been doing this sort of thing effortlessly since Crowe was in nappies (probably...) A bravura performance.Ridley Scott, meanwhile, appears to relish a project of this magnitude. The CGI recreation of the Collosseum is magnificent, but Scott never lets such an impressive element detract from the moments of pure drama to be found in David H. Franzoni's script. Instead, he mixes astonishing set pieces with moments of human interaction seamlessly, creating a thoroughly nourishing and rewarding cinematic experience.Proof that they might just make 'em as good as they used to...?",Gladiator
126,Screen_Blitz,Very riveting and entertaining epic brought together by Ridley Scott,9,24 November 2015,"Directed by critically-acclaimed director Ridley Scott comes an historical epic action flick that embraces one of the most powerful tales of revenge ever put together on screen. Set in 180 A.D, this movie follows Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe) in one of the most powerful Roman empires, who chosen by the favor of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris) to the throne of the Roman republic. This sparks incredible jealous in this son Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix) who the emperor deems as unsuitable for the job. Consumed with anger, Commodus murders his fathers and sends an army to murder the wife and child of Maximus. Vowing revenge of Commodus, Maxmius works his way up to the gladiator rank by fighting against the most powerful spartans in the gladiator arena, and his effort eventually leads to the fight of his life. Director Ridley Scott really outdone himself with this enthralling epic, shining more effort and incredible direction from his 'Alien' franchise. Scott polishes this film with a captivating story and masterful script that fuels with film from to start. Opening with an intense and harrowing battle scene between the Roman army and the Greek army that leads to countless bloodshed, the Gladiator boasts a story with such depth and energy, and uses some powerful characters like the main antagonist who is brought to life by the tour-de-force performance by Joaquin Phoenix. Commodus frightens audiences with his cruel and unsettling demeanor, and Joaquin Phoenix boasts such energy into this character, he makes it so believable. Russell Crowe also grabs the spotlight with his performance as the main character Maximus. While the film may not have the power to fill in for its occasionally humdrum pacing, it fuels its plot with some great writing and strives a strong narrative that audiences will not be given much of a choice than to sit through it.Gladiator is arguably Ridley Scott's best picture and one of the best historical epics put on screen. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are both outstanding in this film and deserve a round of applause. This is a film is worth watching for most, but those who are sensitive to graphic and bloody combat may want to stay away from this one.",Gladiator
127,dunmore_ego,Unleashing Helle.,8,6 March 2009,"Truly GLADIATOR is the stuff of great fiction; a story so well-orchestrated and superbly told, there might well have been in Roman history a general who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor.But - as they used to say in ancient Rome - ""only in Hollywood...""Russell Crowe is Ancient Roman General Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of a fierce and loyal army that has conquered the known world under Emperor Marcus Aurelius (regal, world-weary Richard Harris). Maximus plans to retire to his olive gardens with wife and son, but the sickly Emperor has other ideas, bequeathing Maximus the stewardship of Rome over that of his natural-born son and rightful heir, the fey Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). When Commodus discovers this slight, he cries a little, promptly kills his father, arrests Maximus, and gets progressively feyer.Commodus then invents the James-Bond-Batman-Death, that is, don't kill your nemesis quickly and efficiently in full view, order your incompetent men to take him somewhere and probably kill him if he doesn't use his dangerous ingenuity and superior combat skills to escape. This also guarantees you are completely in the dark as to whether your enemy is dead, until he appears unexpectedly somewhere and vexes you.This Maximus does, defying Commodus and leaving him terribly vexed.Thereby arriving at Part Three of the slogan. In the interim, Maximus discovered his family was crucified by Commodus, which caused Maximus untold Academy Award-Winning Acting, subsequently collapsing in the desert and taken into slavery. The Gladiator merchant, Proximo (Oliver Reed, gravel-throated, rheumy-eyed - his last performance before going to that great arena in the sky) handpicks the indifferent yet lethal Maximus to join his stable of gladiators (which includes neighborly Numidian, Djimon Hounsou and man-mountain Ralf Moeller). Proximo scores a gig at The Coliseum, for the pleasure of now-Emperor Commodus.As Darth Vader thoomed, ""The circle is now complete."" There were arena skirmishes before this one, but the Coliseum ""Carthage reenactment"" is the grandest rock star battle for Proximo's now-renowned gladiator troop, inspired and led by Maximus, as stirring and blood-pounding as BEN-HUR's chariot race. GLADIATOR's raucous, blood-glutted battle scenes are fitting successors to the ""realistic"" warfare of BRAVEHEART and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN.""Are you not entertained?"" His helmet disguising his identity, Maximus rallies ""his"" gladiators to defeat the lethal Imperial chariot-riders in the arena, to the surprise of Commodus, who wishes to meet the upstart who would not even salute the throne, let alone die conveniently for the public's pleasure. Maximus reveals himself to Commodus, who is driven to remarkable heights of feyness.Discovering Maximus is alive makes not only Commodus weak in the knees - so too his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), who pined for him back when her father the Emperor owned Maximus's taut butt. Her betrayal of Commodus sets in motion the third act, steeped in politics of reclaiming Rome as a republic, and therefore losing some of its verve.Beautifully filmed, in ocher tones and burnt umber (by director Ridley Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson), GLADIATOR nabbed Russell Crowe a Best Actor Oscar - even though Joaquin Phoenix did all the actual acting! Crowe pulls the Bruce Willis for most of the film, while Phoenix's sway-tilt emotions are a disturbing rainbow of subtlety.Phoenix's performance is absolutely stunning - that of a weak man, filled with disillusionment, contempt, envy, indecision; conflicting emotions constantly dancing across his face, flickers of smiles when we know he wants to cry humiliation, edging tears when we know he would rather lash out like the simple animal he is. It is Acting of a caliber few writers or directors could even describe, let alone trust an actor to convey.""What we do in life echoes in eternity."" Well. maybe, depending on what eternity you're talking about. For all its awe-inspiring action and chest-beating man-sweatiness, GLADIATOR has its faults: writers David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson can't figure what ancient civilization they're writing for. These are ROMANS, boys. So when Maximus pep talks his men at the very first battle ""...if you find yourself alone, riding in green fields with the sun on your face, do not be troubled, for you are in Elysium - and you are already dead!,"" his troops should have replied, ""Excuse sir, but isn't that where GREEKS go?"" In his prayers, Maximus appeals to a ""Blessed Father"" - Jupiter? Janus? GLADIATOR pulls no punches when depicting the slaughter of countless of god's creations, yet is too gutless to depict polytheism. Especially in the Lead Actor with the Oscar push.When Maximus prays to the effigies of his wife and son and the Numidian asks, ""What do you say to them?"" he answers, ""To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business."" Big bonding laugh. Let me get this straight: he's joking about sticking it to his raped and crucified wife in the afterlife? Is that not inappropriate? Are you not entertained? ""It vexes me. I'm terribly vexed."" Phoenix all in white, Gladiator stumbling from a stab wound and seeing his predestination Christian homecoming, Jumilla giving a eulogy that makes our flesh crawl, the Numidian (who had his own religious beliefs) succumbing to the Christian myths (after all, they are the right ones, of course! Not like those other stupid religions, which Christians are still trying to wipe off the face of the Earth) and sotto voce, ""We will see each other again - but not yet!""...Apparently, Gladiator is ""going home."" Believe in a myth hard enough and it will come true.Hail Caesar and all that. Romani Ite Domum.--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania).",Gladiator
128,pyrocitor,Are you not entertained?,10,16 March 2005,"Few films deserve the title 'Masterpiece'. Being able to capture the emotional impact, dramatic force and all around power of what we would consider a masterpiece is simply beyond most films that make their ways to the cinema these days. I think it's fair to say the Gladiator is one of the very few films that does not fall short of expectations. Instead, it easily surmounts them, drawing the viewer in, and forcing out of them every possible emotion by it's sheer power. We can't help but cheer when Maximus strikes down yet another foe in the arena, we can't help but boo and groan with malcontent as the purely evil Commodus (there's no other way to put it) plans his next scheme. Gladiator manipulates our emotions in a way that is fantastic to behold - Hans Zimmer's beautiful and majestic score keeps the mood flowing, and the simple story is brought up by the sheer scope of the production and the incredible performances driving the film.It's been said so many times by now, but Russell Crowe is nothing less than magnificent, easily deserving his Academy Award for his performance. His stunning performance drives the film, and keeps the audience engaged throughout - never once can we take our eyes off him, or be drawn out of the incredible story he draws us into. Joaquin Phoenix, playing Maximus' nemesis, the scheming Commodus, is stunning. The sheer evil he exudes must be applauded, as his paranoid, arrogant, power-hungry dictator is slowly but steadily forced out of the favor of the people by Maximus is breathtaking. We develop a genuine hatred for Commodus, and openly cheer whenever Maximus wins public favor over him. Few villains have matched Phoenix's ability to be genuinely vile to the core. Connie Nielson is also terrific as Commodus' strong-willed but fearful sister, living in a web of apprehension once her brother takes power over Rome. Oliver Reed, sadly in his last performance, is great as Proximo, the slave dealer, who as Maximus puts it, is ""in danger of becoming a good man"". Djimon Hounsou is wonderful as Maximus' loyal fellow slave and gladiator, and Richard Harris is a strong presence as Marcus Aurelius, the previous emperor of Rome, slain by Commodus' murderous ambition.I am hard pressed to find any flaw with Gladiator. It excels in every possible area - wonderful set and costume design, a superb musical score, top notch performances, and an overall sense of power which cannot help but draw you in, and let the viewer witness the majesty firsthand. Are you not entertained? At the very least, you should be.-10/10",Gladiator
129,Maciste_Brother,Rambo of Rome,3,10 January 2010,"As a fan of Peplum films (or Sword & Sandal) and having enjoyed previous films from Ridley Scott, I was surprised by how disappointing GLADIATOR was.The first thing that stood out is how badly shot it was. The DP (and Scott) missed the boat on this one. The film's constant greyish tone was off putting and uninspired. It tries to give the film a realistic look but comes across as forced and in the end more fake than anything else. Because the look of the film wasn't believable, the film's other weaknesses stood out even more, like the acting. Except for Joaquin and the veteran cast, the acting was sub-par. Crowe is monotonous, almost sleepwalking through the entire epic. He can't really be blamed as his character is as one dimensional as possible. He acts like a robot, an unstoppable robot who kills everyone in sight. In one scene, Maximus enters the stadium grounds and proceeds to kill a dozen other gladiators, one after the other, in a single run. The scene is so ludicrous that the reality of the film flew out the window and couldn't get into the predictable story with Maximus reduced to a Roman version of Rambo.The monotonous look of the film also can't camouflage the obvious CGI which today looks even more cardboady than it did 9 years ago. To make things even more tedious, the entire film is a direct rip-off of Anthony Mann's THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, which, albeit wasn't great but at least it respected the intelligence of its audience, unlike GLADIATOR which is the fast food version of history. All of this could have been overlooked had the film been entertaining on some level but the slow pace, ponderous tone and predictable story killed all possibilities for it being entertaining. It's not a fun film at all.In the end, GLADIATOR, which won the Oscar for best picture (it must have been a really bad year), is not even remotely memorable in any way shape or form. Give me a vintage Italian Sword & Sandal flick, like THE REBEL GLADIATORS, before this inert Hollywood production.",Gladiator

133,Jeremy_Urquhart,Theatrical and extended cut review/comparison,10,20 April 2020,"Is Gladiator a straight action movie? Not exactly. It's definitely action-packed, but to call it ""just"" and action movie would be doing the film a disservice in my opinion. This is not a mindless film, although it it a fairly easy watch. However, I do think it has a good deal of substance- it's a movie that stuck with me, and that's definitely not something that happens with most action movies I watch.Action films are good ""relaxation"" movies. It's the genre you watch when you really can't be bothered thinking too much, and just want to switch your mind off a bit and watch stuff blow up and people get hurt. Action movies have a certain cathartic quality, and are often hugely entertaining because they show us things on screen that we hardly ever get to see in our day to day lives. As an action movie, Gladiator succeeds. There's a large number of exciting, fantastically shot and edited arena sequences that really make you feel as though you're there. The fight sequences are visceral and convincing. There's also a large scale battle at the start of the film, which in my opinion is the film's one low point. It's not quite as exciting as it should be, and it's bizarrely shot in jumpy slow motion and with hand-held cameras, a style that is not maintained throughout the film. It kinda feels like Saving Private Ryan's famous opening sequence (a little bit), which is odd. The rest of the movie's fantastic though.It's not a deep film intellectually- the plot's quite straight-forward, the character's motivations are hardly ever ambiguous, and dialogue scenes never go on for a great deal of time. That being said, the film excels in my eyes because of its deep and engaging emotional core. I really cared for Russel Crowe's character, Maximus, and the moment he is betrayed by Commodus- a complete scumbag masterfully played by Joaquin Phoenix- I was absolutely 100% rooting for him to get his revenge and bring his rival to justice.Yeah, it's basically a revenge tale, but I think it really succeeds because Russel Crowe does such a fantastic job at making his character incredibly likeable, and Phoenix does such a good job at playing an utterly despicable villain. And sometimes, that's all you need in order to be utterly invested in a film, even a fairly long one (2.5 hours) like Gladiator. Of course, the movie has more going for it- a good screenplay, some memorable side characters, a fantastic score (Hans Zimmer at his best), some stunning cinematography, and great pacing too- there's hardly a dull moment in the entire movie. Plus the ending is amazing; absolutely perfect for the movie.So, if it's not clear already, I'd say go ahead and watch this movie. Don't be put off by any expectations you might have towards it- it's honestly probably better than you think it's going to be. Make sure you watch the theatrical cut though, rather than the extended edition. The former goes for 155 minutes, while the latter goes for 171 minutes. Trust me, you really feel those extra 16 minutes in the extended cut.Some DVDs and blu-rays try to pass the extended cut off as the ""Director's Cut,"" presumably because director Ridley Scott has somewhat of a reputation for having movies where the director's cut is generally seen as better than the theatrical cut- see Kingdom of Heaven (which I haven't seen yet), and Blade Runner. I knew something wasn't quite right when I watched Ridley Scott's one minute ""introduction"" to the so-called director's cut of the film. From memory, the very first thing he said was something along the lines of ""this is not my director's cut,"" stated that it was rather an ""extended cut,"" and then I think he even mentioned, or maybe implied, that he himself preferred the theatrical cut. Then someone must have glared at him off-camera, because I think he then begrudgingly said something about how the extended cut still made some interesting changes, before reiterating once again that this was NOT his ""director's cut,"" and not his preferred version.Well, that's just great, I remembered thinking to myself. I watched the extended cut anyway, even if Ridley Scott's words had dampened my expectations considerably. It was interesting, to an extent, to compare it to the original (and significantly better) theatrical cut. Basically, I'd estimate that about 14 of the 16 new minutes purely focus on Phoenix's character, which oddly almost creates the impression that the movie is just as much about him as it is about Maximus. We see (or at least it feels as though we see) just as much Commodus as we do Maximus, and this takes the spotlight off the hero, whose journey we're supposed to be focused on, and shifts a bunch of the focus to Commodus, who we already hate enough just going by his scenes in the theatrical cut. His new scenes in the extended cut don't really give much new insight into his character- they just show him being a horrible personWe already knew he was a horrible person though. A massively horrible one.So if you can help it, track down the theatrical cut for Gladiator rather than the extended cut. Best option might be to get the Blu-ray actually; it comes with both versions on the same disc (plus the picture quality is exceptional). That way, you can watch the theatrical cut first, and then if you really feel like it, you can check out the extended cut, but you'll likely be a little let down by it.
Just a heads-up there.
Because I care.Really, the two cuts of Gladiator just go to show how much of a difference trimming a few scenes can make to a movie, and how just 16 extra minutes can kind of change the balance of an already extremely well-crafted story. The extended cut sort of kills the pacing a couple of times throughout the film, and awkwardly gives Commodus more scenes than he needs, but it's honestly still a very good movie. It's just that the theatrical cut is substantially better.Absolutely give this movie a watch- it gets my highest recommendation (if that means anything to anyone).",Gladiator
134,TheUnknown837-1,"I personally wouldn't have given it Best Picture, but it is a very fine, bravura motion picture",8,3 October 2010,"The opening scenes of ""Gladiator"" are a little stodgy. The movie, like many of its genre, commences with a big battle scene in which our hero, Maximum (Russell Crowe) sets fire to a forest while storming against the enemies of Rome. The scene opens up with predictable set-up dialogue and the following battle is rather unconvincing with a plethora of strobes and far too much blurred-up slow-motion. Frankly, I also just did not care for John Mathieson's cinematography in this scene or throughout the movie (I'll agree with Roger Ebert on that note).However, after a rather uninteresting opening, ""Gladiator"" counterattacks with a lot of bravura and a lot of kinetic power. Ridley Scott, who has not disappointed me in the cinema yet, succeeded yet again here. He just had to come back from a lackluster opening.Following the scene I just described, Scott takes us on a (partially-true) journey in which General Maximum is betrayed by the sudden heir to the throne of Italy (Joaquin Phoenix) who smothered his father (Richard Harris) and put the penalty for the crime on the general, whom Harris had originally intended to name successor to the throne. Rather primitive motives, but Scott whips through that rather quickly and moves onto a really enjoyable saga that seems, oddly enough, more like a remake of Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus"" than of Maximus. He is captured by a slave trader (Oliver Reed) and trained to be a gladiator in the Coliseum. Phoenix wants to slay Maximus, but since the public goes for a tough gladiator, his only real method of doing so would be to pit him against tough opponents in the ring.Every now and then I'm in for a good, old-fashioned adventure tale with a fairly familiar flow and a lot of technical virtuosity. All I require is that there be a competent creative artist sitting in the director's chair. And Ridley Scott, who immortalized himself with ""Alien"" in 1979, is most certainly one who fits those requirements. I think Scott realized early on in production that he did not the greatest of characterization in his screenplay and that the motives of all of the characters were primitive. It's a typical jealousy-revenge tale, so instead he proceeds to give it a lot of energy and zest. He presents us a lot of scenes in which Russell Crowe is clad in armor and forced to duke it out with other gladiators and sometimes dangerous beasts such as tigers.I don't really have a whole lot to say about ""Gladiator"" because I said most of it when I wrote my review for ""Spartacus,"" the picture that this one most reminds me of. That also being said, I think ""Gladiator"" is a very good movie, just as entertaining as the one I just mentioned, and well worth seeing. Although personally I would rather skip over that dull opening fight sequence and predictable setup dialogue and cut right to the chase. And I still think the cinematography by John Mathieson is phony-looking and ruins some of the intended historical atmosphere. But that's just me, measuring the pros and cons. The former outweight the latter.I probably wouldn't have given it Best Picture, but ""Gladiator"" is a very fine historical epic with a lot of bravura showmanship and kinetic energy.",Gladiator
135,baumer,What film making is all about! Let the summer sweeps begin!,10,10 May 2000,"I love the summer season for movies.  Some of the best films have been released in the summer.  Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones, Star Wars, Rambo, Jaws, films that pack a punch.  Films that are high on octane and short on melodramatic self importance like the Virgin Suicides.  Chalk Gladiator up as one of the great summer films that has been thrust upon us.  This film has it all, action, gore, bravado, amazing battle sequences, wonderful choreography and a rising star.  Russell Crowe has played his share of different roles but it is this one that is probably going to make him a household name.  Here he is buffed and muscular and visibly toned down from Oscar nominated role in The Insider.To review this film is really pointless.  To criticize it is even more useless.  If you go into this film the way many sometimes over rated-self important critics do and expect another Spartacus, is just plain stupid. Spartacus is a movie unto itself.  I don't think Gladiator wants to be Spartacus, I think it just wants to entertain.  And guess what?  It does that with flare.  There is enough action in here to please those of us that are from the Raiders of the Lost Ark school.  And dare I say it, but this film is better than Braveheart.  I can honestly say that my heart was pounding the entire time I was sitting in the theater.  Some of the battle scenes were what I would consider some of the best ever filmed.  I have to say that the opening battle was not my favourite as Scott opted for way too many close ups where he should have let the action speak for itself.  But that is the only complaint.  Every battle was epic, every attempted mutiny was thrilling and every sneering, wining, sniveling sound that Joaquin Phoenix uttered made me want to get in the ring with him.  I can't believe this is the same guy that was masturbating a lot in Parenthood.  What a resume he has for himself.Gladiator is the first real summer blockbuster in this young season.  And judging by the audience reaction to it and judging by how good it is, it should go on to be one of the big guns from this summer.  I think at this point we are all tired of all the utter excretement that has been forced down our throats so far in this year, we are ready for a film like Gladiator.  This is a film that is worth seeing two or three times.  It is that good and that much fun.Again, it is useless to tell you what is good or bad about the film.  If you like action and violence and men beating each other until death, and ancient battles and names like Caesar and Rome and shades of Hamlet and such, and if you like to watch men get attacked by tigers and slice other people's bellies open and chop off heads and other parts of the body, then this is the film for you.

140,mentalcritic,A special film for one odd reason...,10,5 August 2000,"Detractors claim this film is a hollow entry in the Roman gladiator genre for the most pedantic of reasons. Nothing could be further from the truth. This film is one of the greatest ever made because it has the power to move people, specifically myself. I don't mean just move me in the same way that Robocop or the Star Wars saga move me by making me see aspects of my past and how I would ideally change them. I mean that Gladiator moves me by making me look at the details of a life that was, and still is to some extent, slowly dragging me down and making me abandon life altogether, and motivating me to make a commitment in the way I deal with it.That commitment? Like Maximus, I realised that I am not ready for my life to be over until I have made something more of it. Maximus could not die until he had transcended the way in which Commodus had victimized him, and liberated Rome from Commodus' inferiority complex that masqueraded as a dictatorship. As I saw this unfold on the screen in front of me, I took the death of my fiancee and the abuse of my past and saw that the future was not set, and I could still make my life something worth living.This alone justifies Gladiator's place in the 250 best films of all time, in spite of its relatively miniscule flaws. Before I die, I want to shake Russell Crowe's hand. His performance as Maximus reduced me to a tearful wreck, and at the same time moved me to do something nothing else could move me to do: let go and move on. I will always owe Crowe and Scott a huge debt for this film, which means more to me than any film I have seen before (more than five thousand, so don't bother arguing with me about it) or probably will in the future.",Gladiator
141,Karl Self,Too Long And Not Very Good,2,3 March 2001,"In German there is a good expression for movies such as Gladiator (G): ""Historienfilm"" -- it means that it is a movie which has a historic backdrop, but is not a movie ABOUT history.  What worries me is that many people will think that G is realistic, that the historic context of it or even the entire story are accurate, which is not the case.I found the movie definitely too long -- it would be much better if it had been cut by 45 or 60 minutes.  The story line was too pompous, without much suspense, and ordinary.  The ""look and feel"" (camerawork, lighting, sound track, decoration, casting, etc.) is high quality, though too glossy and commercial - like for my taste.  As for believability -- oh well.  Maybe seen from America ancient Germany is just a quick horse ride away from Rome and right next to a gladiator training center in the middle of the desert, but trust me -- it is not.  And I do understand that there has to be a bad guy, but did it have to be a hare - lipped, father - killing, sister - fancying, paedophile dictator?  And did the good guy have to be such a sickly - sweet mixture of George Washington, Rambo and Walt Whitman?  And -- on a slightly jingoistic note -- if the ancient Germans were such club - swinging barbarians (""hunh?  cavalry attack from back, that no fair""), how come the Romans never did capture the territory?Conclusion:  if the movie had been shortened, I would have found it OK to watch on the small screen (rental or free TV).  As it is, I did not like it. And I find it depressing that such a great director as Ridley Scott seems to have dedicated himself to producing glossy, mind numbing garbage.",Gladiator
142,marcin_kukuczka,"Majestic production that won 2000s-audience; Fabulous Roman epic that echoes in film history as ""masterpiece""",10,18 June 2006,"They were just shadows and dust. Yet, their courageous deeds have been admired for hundreds of years. Their name was ... gladiators.Since 1959 and the release of the ultra popular Roman epic BEN HUR, many people have thought that William Wyler's movie reached the ultimate splendor on screen and no other production may take its stead. However, the memorable year 2000 sees a premiere of GLADIATOR by Ridley Scott. The movie's title does not indicate any novel nor any specific period of Roman history. Yet, the film becomes one of the top Hollywood productions. What is so extraordinary about it that GLADIATOR is admired not only by epic fans but by the audiences of different interests, different preferences, different expectations from a movie.First of all, GLADIATOR, unlike many other epics, shows a very realistic image of the Roman Empire and makes a perfect use of this on screen. In this case, the movie which discusses a very distant period in time (2nd century A.D.) occurs to be clearly interpreted and understood by the 21 century-audience. This fact proves a great talent of the director, Ridley Scott, who exactly knows viewers' expectations. Such a movie is more a spectacle and entertainment than pure history. Therefore, even if there are historic figures in the film, we cannot treat it as history and look for historical accuracy or inaccuracy. It is much more since it generally shows Rome, its power, its emperors, its people, its games, finally...its gladiators.It seems quite unnecessary to present the content of the film while hundreds have done this before me. What I want to concentrate on GLADIATOR's universal aspect, which makes it an exceptional epic. As a matter of fact, no one will fully understand the story of Maximus (Russell Crowe) without profound reflections. Simply, the entire content of GLADIATOR is one great symbol. A simple man, a farmer becomes a great leader, emperor's friend. Yet, when times change, he gets through a personal tragedy becoming a slave, a gladiator whose primary task is to amuse people and the corrupted emperor by killing. Nevertheless, it is him who is honored at his death - He was the one who loved Rome. In my opinion, the very first shot of the movie shows it all - where Maximus heart is - a bird symbolizing gentleness, and fields symbolizing his life. The final fight on arena between emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus cannot be treated historically. It is a symbolic battle between two visions of Rome (using modern language - between two visions of the world) - the one of honor, equality and love and the one of decadence, slavery and corruption. And this is, I think, the most important message of this movie. In this perspective, the movie develops all characters universally.CAST: Russell Crowe, who portrays Maximus, does a very fine job. He portrays a man of a good heart who is exposed to living in the reality that is against all he heads for, a leader who got a new name, ""gladiator"". I loved his performance in one scene more than in any other - in the conversation with the emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Wonderful meeting of two seeing one goal - goodness of Rome! Joaquin Phoenix is also very memorable as brute Commodus, a corrupted emperor who is, on the one hand, a blood sucker, but, on the other hand, a man who wants to be loved. I also loved the performance of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. This beautiful Danish actress very well fits to this role portraying a woman who lives in the very ambiguous reality. A note must also be made of Derek Jacobi, unforgettable Claudius from a perfect BBC series made almost 30 years earlier. Yet, two performances by already late actors are a must to mention, Richard Harris's phenomenal portrayal of Marcus Aurelius and Oliver Reed's slave trader Proximo. Oliver Reed died during filming and his death is a terrible loss to all film industry. We thank him for such a powerful performance in this film, unforgettable, forever in our hearts and minds.Some people say that GLADIATOR is too violent. I admit that there are very brutal moments, especially the ones showing arena fights. Nevertheless, that is what these fights looked like. Visual effects of the movie are so stunning that I was lost in admiration. Commodus's triumphant entrance to Rome (a bit exaggerated in size but representing not that much a city but rather its power), the sequence at Zucchabar, a fictional Roman province set in Mauretania Caesariensis, the imperial palace, the brutal battle in the woods of Germania - all is filled with unforgettable grandeur! The locations at Morocco, Malta, Italy and Spain add a thrill to the spectacle.And the music... it is half of the whole entertainment to watch GLADIATOR without the admiration of its excellent musical pieces. It is a flow from sentimentalism, through exotic sounds to the tunes expressing the gore of the arena. I loved the title song, it touched my heart. There is something like a gentle power in it...GLADIATOR is in many aspects a film that will become a cult movie, not only an ancient epic but a masterpiece of movie art. When I was a boy, I was saddened by the fact that I don't live in such times like the 1950s when great masterpieces were released like BEN HUR, QUO VADIS or THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. Yet, GLADIATOR made my dream come true. We all do live in such times, the times of great movies and this is, without doubt, one of such films. 10/10! They were just shadows and dust. However, who among them would predict that they would once (in almost 2000 years) be the characters of such a film masterpiece. So were only the emperors immortal?",Gladiator
143,rupie,sure to last,8,31 August 2000,"I have to take issue with the previous viewer and, for once, align myself with the conventional wisdom on this film; i.e., that it's a keeper. Especially compared with the slick, technology-infatuated, sex-and-violence saturated dreck coming out of Hollywood (not that this movie does not have its share of violence and gore, but always in context and never, in my view, gratuitous) it is refreshing to have a historical film with sweep and grandeur about real characters with some depth. I found Gladiator thoroughly engrossing and beautifully made, although historically it shares some of the fictions of its predecessor The Fall of the Roman Empire ('64) - e.g. that Marcus Aurelius was a patricide (not true) - although to my thinking it is a far superior movie in every respect. Russell Crowe is simply super here - he deserves a Best Actor nomination, no question. My only quibble is that the movie deserved a grander score - John Williams was needed for this one. But all in all, a great show.",Gladiator
144,Stampsfightclub,brilliant period drama,9,30 December 2006,"The passionate patriotic character of Maximus is fighting a battle for Marcus Aurelius, the previous emperor before his tragic death, to make Rome a better place but Aurelius' son Commodus wants to run Rome his own way.The plots consistent with passionate emotional dialogue from each character. There are many different opinions being harassed around in different societies and through the use of battles and family story lines the film enables audience to really feel a passion behind the character's lives.The battle scenes, sword fighting etc are beautifully directed allowing audiences to see graphic scenes of violence which conforms to the war drama genre. It's a very gripping story and reflects the context perfectly.The costume design and setting help to conform to the time in which the film was set and through the use of old time values including slavery and money we are thrust deep within character and society values.Russell Crowe (Master and Commander) won an Oscar for best actor in a leading role and although I wasn't a huge fan of his character at certain points during the film I can tell that he acted his heart you and deserved his award for playing the emotional yet strongly determined soldier.The interplay between the characters is also strong and creates fantastic tension for the story to thrive upon, especially between maximus and Commodus.The passion behind each character's actions is remarkable, especially Maximus' antics. It's a truly remarkable story that reflects the time perfectly through the emotion, social values, costumes and settings (the Coliseum is tremendous) being a fan of war, period and drama genres this film was perfect and if you are into any of those genres then i definitely recommend this Oscar winning epic. i believe it is a must watch for anyone actually because it is that good.",Gladiator

This really does have feel of of a Hen Hur type epic and it deserves all the plaudits it gets. The Computer technology and the cinamatography that make up this film is breath taking as are the fight scenes.

147,KnightsofNi11,An epic that isn't epic enough,7,22 August 2011,"Ridley Scott's highly acclaimed, best picture winning film seems to be the right formula for the quintessential roman epic. However, I wouldn't allot it quite that much praise. In my humble opinion, speaking that highly of this film would be giving it a little too much credit when it isn't that masterful of a film. It's good, but not that good. It's the story of Maximus, a valiant Roman soldier who is betrayed by his emperor and cast out of Rome, only to return and find his wife and son murdered. Having lost everything, Maximus is captured by slave traders and sold to a man named Proximo who is assembling men to fight in Rome's epic gladiator games. Maximus takes this opportunity to return to Rome and enact his revenge on Commodus, the evil emperor who betrayed him. The film prides itself on being an epic scale action film, using it's flashy showmanship and it's enticing bloodlust to disguise some of its dullness and its weaknesses in many areas.This is a film I really wanted to like. I really thought I could fall in love with this film, and I thought I was during some of the epic fight scenes full of bloody disgusting action that thrills and horrifies to no end. But there's a certain dullness which saturates everything else about this film so that it doesn't quite reach the heights you are expecting it to. Basically, it is your average hero's journey with every necessary archetype standing out and moving about as you would expect. There are no surprises in this film when you really feel like there should be. This film's storyline isn't inherently bad, it just doesn't offer all that it could with a story as epic as Gladiator perceives itself to be. I found myself very bored at times and never fully being able to buy into what was going on. Maybe it was in the acting, maybe it was in the dialogue, I'm not sure. Maybe it was a combination of all the factors of this film that just left me wanting more and feeling like I had been cheated out of some great potential in the end.But what doesn't leave you feeling cheated are the fight scenes. They are explosive, graphic, shocking, and wildly entertaining. Ridley Scott shoots the film with his frenetic display of camera angles and quick edits that make every fight scene incredibly intense and almost too much fun. Honestly, everything that took place in the Colliseum I really enjoyed. And that's only appropriate for a film called Gladiator, right? However, everything else I wasn't all that fond of. The film strikes no emotional chords with me, despite being a well constructed story that, in theory, exceeds expectations. The execution isn't perfect but I still respect a good story, and that's what Gladiator has at its core. Everything that surrounds it is a different story, though. The film just lacks true prowess and integrity to live up to its epic expectations. If you just take it as is then it's still a good film, but it could have been so much more.I spent this entire film going back and forth between liking and disliking it. There were things I thoroughly enjoyed and thing that just left me feeling empty and careless. In so many moments I felt like I was really going to love this film in the end, but the excitement and intrigue over this film flatlines just below a level of greatness. Gladiator isn't the epic scale story of bravery and violence, but it tries very hard to be. I wouldn't go as far to say that this is a bad film, but I wouldn't give it enough mercy to call it a great film either.",Gladiator

149,Bob-45,I Come to Bury ...,5,26 June 2000,"I wanted to like GLADIATOR, I really did.  My sister said it was a great movie, and I really wanted to please my sister.  But I can't, you see, because GLADIATOR is not a great movie.  In fact, GLADIATOR is not even a particularly good movie.GLADIATOR is ineptly directed by  Ridley Scott; no two ways about it.  What else can explain keeping scenes in which the otherwise competent Russell Crowe lets his Australian accent slip through?  What else Can explain allowing leading lady Connie Nielson sleepwalk through her performance for two thirds of the Movie?  What else can explain carefully crafting a subplot involving a German Shepherd dog, then abruptly dropping it?  The ineptitude goes on and on.  The lack of chemistry between Crowe and Nielson is bad enough without further undercutting it with obtrusive, inappropriate music in early key scenes.  High- and low-key cinematography is intermixed without any concern for dramatic appropriateness.  It is almost as though Scott said, `Cloudy day? No problem, the audience won't notice.'  And lets talk about this cinematography.  Many of the low-key interiors with Joaqin Phoenix and Connie Nielson are so poorly lit, you cannot see Phoenix's eyes!  Poor Phoenix, probably the least experienced of the leads, has the toughest role.  Despite what you may hear, Phoenix does pretty well, despite Scott's undercutting.  ACTION FANS BE WARNED. Scott shoots ALL the action scenes without benefit of long shot (for perspective) and with computer generated and slow-motion action.  Think widescreen movie being shown in television (3:4) format.  Expect to be more confused than entertained.There IS plenty to like in GLADIATOR.  The late Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner is magnificent.  Richard Harris is very good as Marcus Aurelius. Djimon Hounsu, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, Sven Ole-Thorsen and, especially,  Spencer Treat Clark (Lucius) are all fine in supporting roles. Savor them if you must see GLADIATOR.",Gladiator
150,TOMASBBloodhound,"A good try, but too many flaws for ""classic"" status.",7,20 March 2005,"Gladiator is an ambitious attempt to tell the story of a man's revenge against the backdrop of the Roman Empire. Russell Crowe stars as a successful general who is sold into slavery after being deposed by a ruthless upstart young emperor. We see him fight his way through the ranks as a gladiator and eventually square off against the young tyrant on the floor of the coliseum. Though not a historically accurate film, it is still worth seeing for a few of the fight scenes, and some of the performances.Crowe is as good as he needs to be as Maximus, the deposed general who only wishes to return home to harvest his crops after defeating a barbaric army at the film's beginning. However the dying old emperor, well-played by Richard Harris, wants to hand over control of Rome to this fine man. When the emperor's evil son hears of this plan, he kills his father and takes control of the empire. Since Maximus refuses to swear allegiance to the new emperor, he is order to be killed along with his wife and child. Maximus escapes the Roman soldiers, but is soon captured and sold into slavery as a gladiator. The rest of the film is centered around Maximus and his plans to overthrow the young emperor with the help of the emperor's sister and a few well-meaning senators.Gladiator could have been a great film, but it's a little unfocused, and some of the scenes could have been filmed a little better. For example, the opening battle starts off well. We see a fully-armed Roman army set to do battle with a Germanic hoard. We get some good shots of Roman archers and infantry men launching a barrage of arrows and flaming debris on the barbarians, and that looks pretty impressive. However, when the battle becomes hand-to-hand combat, everything becomes too murky and hard to follow. Some of the fight scenes between gladiators have the same sort of problems. Maximus, as his instructor tells him, does in fact kill too quickly. Sometimes he has dispatched five or six men without us even realizing how he did it. True he was an experienced soldier who would have gone for quick and efficient kills, but the spectacle is lost in some instances. The re-created Battle of Carthage is probably the most memorable combat scene, and it works fairly well.Few of the characters in this film are likable or well-defined. Oliver Reed gets the best lines, but his character is never fully developed to the point that we understand him. This could be the result of his untimely death during filming, though. Connie Nielsen and Derek Jacobi also have curious roles in the sense that we never really know who's side they are on, or if they are only using Maximus. There is an implied close relationship between both Maximus and Nielsen's character, but it leads nowhere. When I first saw this film, I thought Jaoquin Phoenix was over-acting badly, but now I'm not so sure. It is more than likely that a young emperor of Rome would have behaved with selfishness and paranoia, and Phoenix seems to revel in his role.Overall, this film reminds me quite a bit of Conan the Barbarian. We have similar scenes and themes throughout. Also, we even get an appearance by Sven Thorsen who played a bad guy in Conan. Here, he plays a former champion who comes out of retirement to challenge Maximus in one exciting scene.This film is really no better than Conan The Barbarian, and Crowe lacks Ahnold's charisma and physique.Bottom line: 7 of 10 stars. Worth a look, but not really Best Picture material.The hound has spoken.",Gladiator

The pace never falters thanks to director Ridley Scott's attentive direction, buttressed by an astronomical budget.

152,stamper,"Good, but could have been Magnificent",8,21 May 2000,"NOTE: Before you read my rating you must be informed that as I was watching this film at the CAROLUS theatre in Nijmegen (Netherlands) at 13.30 on Saturday the 20th of may 2000 there was a constant disturbance by two people in the back, who talked all the time. Except during the break, then they kept quiet, of course. I must also say that I despise thy, thoucompanions and thou friends, who spoil other peoples movie experiences, simply because thy don not appreciate the movie or because thy behave in the same way at home, where you watch movies on TV. If it is the first than, please go away and if it concerns the latter, than please, wait 6 or 8 months and rent it, for then thy can speak to thy companion and do anything you like and not spoil it for others as well!!!!!!!!!This might have affected my final rate for the film!!!Now for my review, of course Gladiator was good. It had a lot of action, which was brilliantly coreographed and filmed by the way, quite a lot of blood (though the film was not very gore) a great soundtrack, good actors, especially Russell Crowe (as the revenge driven Gladiator), River Phoenix (as the psychopathic ceasar) and Connie Nielsen (as the suppressed and terrorised Lucilla). But I also liked Djimon Hounsou and Ralph Möller a lot. The plot actually was good too there were just 2 bothers if you ask me, first of all there are far too many boring politics involved for this action  revenge pic, plus there are a few visions, Crowe had in this film that I found very unfitting, especially that in the end. Oh yes I almost forgot, I didn't like the ending very much. The basics were good but the was it was carried out was way too melodramatic. Standing there and stumbling for many seconds falling, then of course the FINAL words of the hero!! But there were more good than bad things here besides a lot of blood, sadness, sorrow, depression, madness, it all really made you feel for these people. I even had tears in my eyes at one point or two, just as I had with another epic film I saw, which is another classic in my eyes and funny enough has somehow a similar plot (as for the basic revenge story), Braveheart. These are the two best epic classics of the past 10 years and surely two films that may not be missed.As you may have noticed I found the ending rather bad, regarding the rest of the film, this is also the reason, why I say, Gladiator was good, when it could have been HUGE, GIGANTIC, EXCELLENT, it could have been TITANIC!!!But it still is a classic, so stop reading and go see it!8 out of 10",Gladiator
153,tbills2,The Gladiator,9,2 October 2010,"I can say there's only one issue with this movie; the Emperor just doesn't seem believable. I didn't buy it. Why would he get in the arena and challenge a foe he knows he can't beat one on one when he has an entire army at his disposal? That's the major issue. If the Emperor was really crazy enough to do something like that, then he should of been a completely different character; he was portrayed in the wrong way. Just the fact that this movie ends by Maximus getting his revenge in a 1 on 1 death duel against the Emperor seems so lame and so Hollywood. Couldn't you give us an intelligent, realistic ending (like the Emperor has Maximus executed but then someone else comes in Mark Wahlberg in The Departed style and ends up killing the Emperor anyways)? Something other than the simple A-to-B ending it has. It's just a shame because it's such an awesome, epic movie. The writing and story is so smart; there's not a single bad scene. The visuals are epic. The Emperor character is the only reason this beast of a movie earns a 9, not a 10.",Gladiator
154,The_Movie_Cat,"""We are all ultimately dead men. We cannot choose when we die, but we can choose how... so that we are remembered""",6,29 June 2000,"This is probably the most sadly ironic line of Oliver Reed, here in his final film role. A cut 'n' paste last scene aside, the veteran actor gives a graceful performance in a film which would see his death before completion.Sadly, British audiences now associate the star more with a performance on Channel 4 programme ""After Dark""; where, amongst a group of chin-scratching pseuds on a discussion show a drunken Reed argued and forcibly snogged a large lady who was far from amused. ""Do you want me to go?"" questioned Ollie, who promptly did, gin in hand, when the rest of the guests begged him to leave the studio. Or maybe his most famous moment would be a slot on a primetime chat show, a jug of orange juice and vodka in hand, bellowing the lyrics to ""Wild One"".If only for giving Ollie back his grace does Gladiator deserve praise. Direction, while derivative and gimmicky, is also well done (though it's easily Ridley Scott's weakest work). Derek Jacobi has a nice role, most famous, of course, for the mini series I, Clavdivs. Russell Crowe is Russell Crowe, all mean, macho and moody with a tiny glimmer of sensitivity underneath. A bit dull for a film that lasts ten days or however long this one went on for.The visions of the afterlife are a little bit silly, and there's never a moment when you don't know how it's all going to end. But objectively, this is a film you can admire. Subjectively, I was bored rigid and kept losing concentration all the way through. Don't mistake me, I enjoy a good epic, but there's no emotional involvement to root you to this film, and ultimately I didn't care about Crowe's character.Sometimes the CGI is a little too obvious, already dated whereas the 50-odd year old Ben Hur still stands up. I laughed at the tiger that looked like it'd come straight out of a ZX Spectrum, and as for the dead one. I was reminded of comedian Brian Connelly. His catchphrase? ""It's a puppeeeeeeeeeeet!""The villain is a nice portrayal of the guy that just wants to be loved. But what makes him such a bad guy? Maybe it's the fact that he kills his father, wants to sleep with his sister and has a harelip. No grey areas for Ridley. Crowe is the manly, bronzed, masculine guy that all the women love.Gladiator is not a bad film, and I did give it a ""6"".

Mostly they are showcases of his visual flair, here is no exception.  Nonetheless, I find Gladiator better than Braveheart for the following reasons.1) More epic in scale and better use of lighting rather than Braveheart's take on Henry V.2) There is a visual style here that Mel Gibson doesn't provide in his movie.  There are many Scott trademark shots and some new ones.3) More characters to deal with.  Overall, Braveheart was Gibson running the whole show.  Here there is a helpful supporting cast to get him through. Kudos to the late Oliver Reed.4) Less outright brutality.  If Braveheart is a medieval version of Saving Private Ryan, then Gladiator is a Roman take on John Woo's ""THE KILLER"". 'Nuff said.Both films have their highs and lows, but the biggest fault I have with this one is that there is very limited sound effects usage.

It is too big to put into an action film. When Phoenix describes the deaths of the gladiator's wife and son; the action is stopped. Scripts that have power are unstoppable trains. The camera work is dark throughout. There is a haze over every scene of unfocused surroundings. Computer generated stadium and battle scenes are over used and lack sharpness. The sword fight between Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix looks unchoreographed and dangerous to the actors.

This is that movie.",10,14 May 2002,"*SPOILERS*Few movies are as breath-taking and exciting as GLADIATOR, a film that contains brilliant battle sequences and marvelous storytelling. After returning from a long, hard battle during the time of the Punic Wars, Maximus (Russel Crowe) is coming home. Greeted by the Caeser (Richard Harris) and his son Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus is expecting gratitude for the work that he has served during the war. But, when the Caeser is murdered by Commodus after learning that he shall not be Emperor, Maximus is ordered to be executed. Escaping his executors, Maximus  is sold off as a slave and must fight in the arena as a gladiator. Commodus then orders for Maximus' wife and son to be killed. When Commodus finds him, Maximus will do anything to exact his revenge. Russel Crowe gives a spotty performance, but it wasn't anything special. Joaquin Phoenix (THE YARDS) was the person who I was most impressed by. He does a good job as the creepy emperor. And it really sucks to learn that Oliver Reed passed away during filming. He did a really good job too. And look for Djimon Honsou (DEEP RISING) as Juba the hunter.
I like the atmosphere of the film. I like the way Rome was recreated as it was back in 180 AD. The opening battle sequence was one of my favorite parts. It has a slight ring of SLEEPY HOLLOW to it, with its cloudy and gloomily eerie sky. This film has everything, action, drama, a little romance, suspense, adventure, and even somewhat of a horror story to it. During the end, when Joaquin Phoenix is giving off his ""Busy little Bee"" story, I was getting a little spooked by his performance. It has something that relates to a royal conspiracy of some sort. When we get into the battles, you are enticed by an endless array of action. GLADIATOR is a great movie. While I don't feel that Crowe's performance should have garned him the Best Actor award, I still think that he should've gotten credit. This is a milestone in filmmaking....5/5.",Gladiator
161,rebeljenn,"uninspiring story and characters, not saved by good cinematography",4,28 November 2005,"The only good thing that I can say about this film is that it was shot well with careful planning in costume and excellent scenery. I cannot fault the picture/cinematography at all. But, this is the only thing the film has going for it, and this alone cannot save a film.'Gladiator' was over-rated as a classic epic of its time. The story is complex and very dull in many places, and it could have been shortened. Now, I am a big fan of historical fiction films, but this one just did not do it. The story was very weak, and I could not get into it at all. The characters were also another problem. I felt that I could not relate to them. The film is not as engaging - the characters and story are weak so much that none of the great things about this film make a difference. It is too bad because I had some high expectations for this film and the genre.",Gladiator

Russel Crowe makes you truely feel for him amd Jaqulin Phenoix makes you utterly hate him. The fighting scenes are extremely enteraining and interesting! The story portrayed in the film is very moving and is an attention grabber from the start of the Movie. The tone of the show is quite serious, but that's expected with this kind of genre.

164,grahamsj3,A really great film,9,6 February 2003,"Russell Crowe's best work (until A Beautiful Mind). Crowe stars as a brilliant Roman General who is double-crossed by a treacherous prince. Crowe becomes a Gladiator for reasons not fully explained (to my satisfaction at least) and manages to become the greatest Gladiator over a period of time (well, DUH!...it wouldn't be much of a film if he got killed early on, now would it?).

The cast does a very good job everyone except russel crowe I don't really care for him much but everyone else did a fantastic job. The action scenes were very intense and had your heart racing.This movie is about a general (Crowe) who is loved by everyone including the emporer. The emporer does not love his own son however and asks maximus(Crowe) to take over as emporer once he dies. The emporers son finds out though and frames him for his death. They send the general for exectution where he escapes and is rounded up by slave drivers who turn him into a gladiator.This movie is very good. Its a must see for everyone. A lot of people think it is too slow and too long but that is nonsense it is just perfect go watch it.,Gladiator
166,RonellSowes,Where Great Movies Meet Excellent Films,10,19 September 2021,"When you really stop to examine a great film, like Gladiator, there seems to be more to it than just the obvious qualities. Sure, it has: intense fight sequences as well as pathos, an unmatched score, a sweeping visual style, penetrating dialouge, fine performances all around including one of the greatest cinematic heros and a brilliantly crafted and acted villain. But there's something else to it, a je ne sais quoi that makes it click into place and brings before you this masterpiece.I could probably fill up far more space commending this film and listing everything that's done so right, but most of those qualities are already known to those who've seen it. However, one aspect that seems to have gone largely unnoticed in it's more than two decade legacy, are its parallels to Shakespeare's Hamlet.Hamlet is the prince of Denmark who's father, the king, is murdered by his uncle Claudius for the throne, setting him on a quest of vengeance. Here is where the two stories mainly diverge as Hamlet's issue is his lack commitment whereas Maximus suffers from no such issue and his problem is simply how. The two tales then ultimately reconverge at the end when Hamlet is pitted against Laertes-his rival and an ally of Claudius-with whose sister Hamlet shares a brief romance. Early in the duel Hamlet is wounded by Laerates' poisoned blade but still manages to slay him anyway before succumbing to his own wound. The play ends with Horatio(captain of the guard and one of few still loyal to the prince) standing over Hamlet eulogizing him and Fortinbras takes control declaring Hamlet a hero and ordering the guards to carry him off.Now, I don't believe just because it plucked a few things from Hamlet does Gladiator diminish in any way. In fact, all it does(besides further proving the genius of Shakespeare) is elevate itself even higher with its literary foundation. As if Gladiator wasn't excellent enough already.",Gladiator

I found all aspects of the production to be first class: the script, acting, choreography, sets, props, costumes, special effects, and so forth all successfully recreated that long past era. I'm not sure of the historical accuracy but all in all, I found Gladiator to be a truly  excellent film, 9/10.",Gladiator
168,jdkraus,One word...Spectacular!,10,24 July 2006,"I heard plenty reviews of excellence about this film, and I wanted to see it for myself. When I saw it, i couldn't keep my eyes off of it, for I was so captivated by it! The key that makes this film so great is how the story flows:A general who becomes a slave. A slave who becomes a Gladiator. A Gladiator who defied an emperor. The General: The film is based off of the time when the Romans were conquering the known world, and it follows the life of a loyal Roman general named Maximus (Russel Crowe). After winning a victory over the Germanians, he is asked for an unusual duty by the dying Caesar Marcus Aurellius (Richard Harris). Maximus learns from Caesar that the politics have been corrupt, as well as his son, Commidus, heir to his throne (Joaquin Phoenix), a coward, more or less.Caesar begs Maximus to be 'the protector of Rome' and to return the power to the senate for democracry versus dictatorship that has ruled Rome since the late Julius Caesar. Maximus refuses, and thus leads to his punishment. Caeasr's jealousy son murders Caesar out of jealousy, and has Maximus executed, who escapes, but suffers a deeper punishment when his only son and wife are brutally killed by Commidus, his so-called brother. (The film carries a strong father atonement with Maximus, who is no richer than farmer, with Caesar who loves him over his own son, who has no virtues.) The Slave: The film changes when Maximus is swept into slavery, and is forced to fight for his life in the entertainment games of gladiators, including the Battle in Chains. He then develops strong relationships with fellow fighters for the vulgar crowd, and his master Proximo (Oliver Reed). Proximo sees Maximus' greatness in being a Gladiator, and beings him, with the other worthy gladiators, to Rome.The Gladiator: Maximus then must fight against impossible odds including the tiger fight and the Battle of Carthage. Each battle he fights for the people brings him closer to vengeance against the ruthless Commidus, and forces him to follow the dream of the late Marcus Aurellius...a free Rome.Gladiator has the strongest storytelling since Ben-hur! Each event is a cause-to-affect that leads to one final conclusion of a war of brothers. One noble, the other a coward. Flat down, i have to say Russel Crowe's performance was excellent and Oscar worthy. The costumes and set-decorations were phenomenal, and gave an authentic and artistic view of an unforgotten Rome, especially with the Colosseum. The cinematography by John Mathieson was beautiful, especially with the usage of blended colors and vivid photography of the scenery of the lands that are traveled in the films' story. Joaquin Phoenix was also excellent as his role as Commidus; critics hate his role for pouting all the time, but he was just fabulous in his role of a jealousy son who wanted to be loved by a father who didn't love him, but at the same time a vicious villain. The rest of the acting was simply great as well.The visual effects were awesome, the battle sequences were very action oriented and contains the bloodshed needed to be realistic, and the other strong element was the powerful score of Hans Zimmer that was deeply cut from the Oscars. The music did not follow one theme like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dargon (which won), but many themes that are uplifting, sad, and very moving. Overall, Gladiator is an epic on a grand scale, that most filmmakers can't follow, because they focus on visual effects versus the story and acting. It is an all time favorite of mine! An easy 5/5 This is no doubt Ridley Scott's (who deserved the Oscar for director) best feat since Blade Runner!",Gladiator
169,AhmedSpielberg99,A Very Engrossing Shakespearean Tale..... Except It Is Not Based On Shakespeare!,9,19 July 2018,"I'm not a big fan of epic war movies. I didn't like LOTR trilogy as much as most people did. I just don't feel invested in such stories. But I found Gladiator way more engrossing and gripping than any movie in the LOTR franchise. It's masterfully directed, edited, and acted. It's beautifully shot. It has a fantastic score. It's very entertaining, and fast paced, Ridley Scott didn't waste any time, and I watched the extended version! It has very complex and compelling characters. And above all that, it has heart. This movie has a very moving and touching story, and that really surprised me. Russell Crowe gave an iconic performance as Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix delivered a magnetic over-the-top performance as the villain, Commodus. This is a hammy performance that doesn't only fits the film's Shakespearean tale, but it also can easily be justified by the character's motives and persona. As for issues, the pacing of some series of events at the first act that lead to a turning point in the plot was a bit faster than it should be, and .... That's all!(9.5/10)",Gladiator
170,Prichards12345,Watchable but rather nonsensical,6,3 April 2010,"I have to admit I'm somewhat puzzled by the highly-marked reviews and Oscars dished out to this movie. I watched this on Blue-Ray for the first time yesterday, and my partner really enjoyed it - she'd give it two marks higher. Me, I found it occasionally good, overlong, treacle-paced, with a lot of one dimensional characters and stock situations. And a horrible, stupid ending.Gladiator follows the exploits of General Maximus (Russell Crowe), successful military commander, being betrayed by Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix), who usurps his Roman Emperor father Marcus Arelius (Richard Harris). Finding his family brutally murdered, Maximus is captured by slavers who sell him to a Gladiator school run by former Gladiator Proximo (Oliver Reed) And from here Maximus sees a chance to avenge the murder of his family.In truth the movie is rather far-fetched but with some stirring combat sequences. The opening battle in Germania is not particularly well-staged (Cavalry charge through a forest?) I have to admit I found the chief merit in the film to be the performances of some of the actors. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are excellent, as is Joaquin Pheonix, who unfortunately appears to be acting in a different movie from everyone else. He gives a sensitive portrayal of a descent into madness (never once does he go over the top) but the film is really crying out for a black-hat villain, and is weakened overall by the character of Commodus. You feel the senate would usurp him easily, and the Roman political scenes are hopelessly inadequate in capturing the spirit of Rome.Russell Crowe is extremely dull and wooden in the part of Maximus, and I can only assume that Oscars are awarded largely on the strength of studio campaigns. Crowe himself has given much better performances. The music is also a very clichéd variation on Mars The Bringer Of War.So, if you don't expect too much you might like it. To me it's far from a great movie. Ridley Scott has made many better films.",Gladiator
171,raymond-15,Vivid action enthralls and repels in bloody combat,8,15 January 2001,"Severed heads roll across the screen, blood spurts from torn torsos and the clash of steel swords keep the action going in a frenzy of gladiatorial combat.  Film buffs who like plenty of action will find it all here and will especially admire the courage and determination of the greatest of all the gladiators, Maximus, a general who brings glory to Rome when he fights and wins the battle against Germania. Russell Crowe who plays Maximus wields a mighty sword against terrible odds.  Maximus through his agility and experience and working to a plan is able to decimate his attackers however many surround him  When the dying Caesar promises that the General Maximus should take over the control of Rome, the choice of candidate is not popular with Caesar's son who promptly sets about the slaughter of his wife and little son.  Russell Crowe shines as an actor in the scene where he discovers the body of his wife hanging from a tree.  This is a scene filled with emotion and heart-break.  The remainder of the story concerns the avenging of this cruel deed.  Those who dislike the sight of blood will have to close heir eyes many times during this film.  The arena scenes are extremely well done on a broad canvas with sweeping views of blood-hungry spectators screaming ""Maximus! Maximus!..."" The supporting actors give very creditable performances as they get caught up in the intrigue and dirty tricks department of imperial Rome, but all eyes of course are on Russell Crowe as the sweaty gladiator, man of courage, man of action, hoping, as we all hope that good will triumph over evil.",Gladiator

173,Christian_Dimartino,A terrific film.,10,4 June 2012,"To me, Ridley Scott's Gladiator does not fit the description of Oscar. To me it sounds like something that would be nominated for MTV movie awards. So when it won Best Picture back in 2000, I was a little surprised because I thought it wasn't going to go to Steven Soderbergh's terrific drama Traffic. But I must say that Gladiator is better, but only a little better.The emperor (Richard Harris) does not feel that his son (a terrifying Joaquin Phoenix) is the right choice to be king; he feels that Maximus(Russell Crowe in his Oscar Winning performance), a super macho soldier, is the right fit. So when his son realizes this, he kills his father and pits the blame on Maximus. Maximus, having lost everything, sets out for vengeance, and becomes a gladiator.Gladiator is long, and requires your full attention. But trust me, that shouldn't be a problem. I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It's a sprawling, big, blood bath of an epic that always holds you and is far from reaching boredom.The film really belongs to Crowe and Phoenix. Every moment with Crowe is enthralling, and every moment with Phoenix, well, any time Phoenix is on screen in any movie, he sends chills down my spine. Crowe is good, but he doesn't deserve the award here as much as he did in 2001's Best Picture winner, A Beautiful Mind.This is one of Scott's best works. It's up there with Alien, Blade Runner, and American Gangster. It would not have been my top choice though. Personally, I would have chosen Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon or Erin Brockovich over this. But Gladiator is terrific entertainment nonetheless.A",Gladiator
174,MattyGibbs,Modern classic,10,23 June 2013,"This is a wonderfully filmed classic about a roman general turned gladiator who lives to avenge the death of his wife and child. It's a long film but it rarely drags thanks some great fight scenes and a towering performance from Russel Crowe as the gladiator Maximus. There are great performances throughout from Oliver Reed as the slave seller and an amazing performance from Joaquin Phoenix as the sniveling and cowardly Commodus. Gladiator is similar to another epic Spartacus but thanks to a superior dialogue and better fight scenes this even eclipses that great movie. It has all the ingredients a great film needs, a great cast, good story, believable dialogue, great cinematography and a great ending. There is very little you can fault this film for. Maybe it's running time but even though I watched the extended version no scene seemed superfluous. Without doubt of one of the best films of the modern era and a film that will be much loved for years to come.",Gladiator
175,Blue-Grotto,"Maximus, Maximus, . . !!",10,5 May 2020,"There is always something left to fight. We survive if we stay together. A naturally talented, tough and good man from Roman times - a general and gladiator - fights in the service of this notion.Roman general Maximus has everything going for him. A long campaign is coming to a victorious end, the emperor adores him like a son, and he is returning home to his wife and boy. However, the emperor has one more task in mind for Maximus. The trustworthy and widely revered general is tapped to fight corruption in the capital. The plan quickly goes awry when the emperor's preternaturally ambitious and demented son Commodus seizes power by foul play and condemns Maximus to death. Through talent and luck the general eludes an untimely demise, but his family and fortunes do not. The severely wounded and destitute Maximus is captured by slavers and sent to die a second time in the gladiator arena. With a thirst for revenge fueling him, Maximus works to reinvent himself, reclaim his inherent power, and resume the epic battle with Commodus for the heart of Rome and its people.Gladiator brings the Roman empire as well as the art of storytelling alive. Right out of the gate Gladiator held me in thrall with its eerily entrancing melody and realistic, flashy battle scene. The story and themes of Gladiator are immensely satisfying. It is hard to believe a world leader had no empathy and cared more for their ambition and image than for people, but it happened! The characters, sequences and costumes are authentic and extraordinary. The characters are cast so well with Russell Crowe (a man's man as Maximus), Joaquin Phoenix (truly bonkers, unempathetic and frightening as Commodus, who can forget his terrifying line ""am I not merciful?!""), Connie Nielsen (intoxicating Lucilla, a master political strategist, sister to Commodus and love interest for Maximus), and others including Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. With seamless transitions and organization, great writing, experienced direction, resplendent photography, innovative techniques, and captivating action scenes, Gladiator fires on all cylinders. Except I wish it was darker and more daring than its PG rating standard. The fascinating models of Rome combined with dazzling special effects made me feel like I was flying over the ancient city like a modern drone. Encouraged by the film, I went to Rome, toured the colosseum and explored some of its many amazing stories from history and the present.Haters point out that Gladiator takes many liberties with the historical truth, but the film gets the essentials right. If I see a bird in the wild, I do like to know facts about it, but more important is seeing and understanding the bird's character, realizing its beauty, and viewing the bird in the context of larger truths. While keeping with the true flavor to the era, Gladiator - as any good story does - makes us care for more important things than the design of someone's sandals or the exact words they uttered.Are you not entertained?! Apparently, we were. Gladiator won five academy awards for best picture, actor, costumes, sound and effects.

Meanwhile Caesars own blood his adopted son Commodus has other plans. Russell Crowe gives a performance which i never thought he would outclass his work in A Beautiful Mind, Cinderella Man and THe INsider. However Crowe is magnificent in this film. He is a legendary actor for his work in these 4 films alone, thats not counting other significant performances in Proof of Life and LA Confidential. Joaquin Phoenix was also great as the villain, Commodus. Connie NIelsen and Djimon Hounsaou were also great in their roles. This film is a great fictional epic, great direction and atmosphere, brilliant cast and a good screenplay from Franzoni (King Arthur, Amistad), John Logan (Aviator, Last samurai), and William Nicholson (Nell).

177,qormi,Sadiator,7,30 April 2008,"The acting was excellent. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar he won. Joaquin Phoenix was very good as the incompetent Commodus. The rest of the cast was excellent as well. The movie was lacking in direction, sets, and continuity. There were some very interesting and original aspects to the film: Crowe's character was not one-dimensional. Neither was Phoenix's character. However, the direction was terrible and there were some implausible action sequences. In the Coliseum, we see a chariot attack upon huddled gladiators. The action seems confused, and rightly so. Play it out in slow-mo and you'll see gaps where people disappear and reappear. This jumbled computer generated mess looks pale in comparison to the live action scenes shot in the 60's. The part where Maximus throws his sword 100 feet to kill a guy was ludicrous; like a cartoon. The shots of the Coliseum were lacking. It was as if Scott couldn't afford to hire extras to be in the crowd. The sets seemed shabby and dark. The sequence at the beginning where the Romans fight the Barbarians was very well done and memorable. Too bad this quality could not last throughout the film. The ending was not satisfying enough. Maximus should have rammed the sword down Commodus' throat. I'll close with repeating that the computer generated action sequences were poorly done. The action was too fast for the eye to see and, if viewed in freeze frame, very deceptive and phony.",Gladiator
178,Movie-12,One of the year's best; a startling experience. **** out of ****,9,25 May 2000,"GLADIATOR / (2000) ****Ridley Scott is an master at manufacturing highly visual motion pictures with energetic, luminous stories. ""Blade Runner"" and ""Alien"" dazzled us with high tech action and suspense. Now the roman epic ""Gladiator"" vividly captures the time period and atmosphere in which its characters inhabit. This is an excellent looking production, one of the year's best. The movie is a visual tour-de-France; beautiful scenery, awe-inducing sets, convincing cinematography, and believable costume designs bring the ancient Roman Empire to life on screen.The story, set in 180 A.D., details the bitter life of the highly proclaimed General Maximus (Russell Crowe). We first meet him as he reigns a bloody victory after combating a slew of savage barbarians. Dying roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), greatly respects his favored warrior, and even chooses he, over his conniving son Commodus, (Joaquin Phoenix), to rule the dynasty after his passing. The emperor wishes for Maximus to restore the republican government to Rome.When Commodus perceives his father's intents, he is furious. Before Aurelius is able to explain his final demands to anyone, his own son murders him as well as Maximus' precious family, and orders his father's favorite to death. Maximus is underestimated, however, and escapes his condemnation, only to be captured soon afterward and sold into a slave camp led by the greedy Proximo (Oliver Reed). There, he and several other hopefuls, including Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) and Juba (Djimon Hounsou), are trained as gladiators, brutal and dehumanized warriors who fight one another to the death to amuse a live audience.""Gladiator"" contains a descriptive and clear first act. The set up and introduction defines the situations, characters, and motives respectfully. The character development is unordinary although extraordinarily effective; Maximus and Commodus are explained as the story progresses. The audience discovers more about them as the movie intertwines with perplexity. This method of character expansion devises depth and involvement within Maximus, Proximo, and Commodus and his good-hearted relative, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). Russell Crowe (""LA Confidential"") undoubtedly will be further recognized as a sensational actor after his appearance as the gladiator. This determined actor conquers his role with complexity and optimal intensity. His performance is more solid than his in the Oscar nominated ""The Insider."" Joaquin Phoenix (""Clay Pigeons,"" ""8MM"")  is diabolical and mischievously believable. Connie Nielsen (""Soldier"") also shimmers in her timid but decisive performance.The confrontation scenes between Commodus and Maximus are hypnotic. The movie grants profound power when the two arch enemies discover each other's identity for the first time. ""Gladiator"" portrays its riveting characters with style and penetration; I really cared about the compelling figures in this movie.I did find a few trifling external problems within this otherwise flawless production. The film's combat sequences are high impact, intensely believable and some of the most involving moments in movies this year. However, the camera work often deprives us from indulging in the shear graphic qualities of warfare. Sometimes the scenes are too sketchy and brief, unlike the fighting in ""Braveheart"" and ""Saving Private Ryan.""In a time of the year when high-brow movies are rare, ""Gladiator"" offers clever writing, smart dialogue, involving characters, and perfect timing. This film is a feast for the senses, an overwhelming jolt of energy, a touching journey into the past. ""Gladiator"" is not merely a movie, but it is an experience.",Gladiator
179,alice liddell,All hail Maximus Acronyms - Romans Unite Before Bullying Insurgent Spanish Heman! (possible spoiler in final paragraph),1,16 May 2000,"There is a lovely film in here about a spoilt brat teenager who unfortunately has tyrannical rule over the Roman Empire.  So whereas most sulky boys kick tables and storm off to their room, Commodus Caesar gets to throw those who annoy and humiliate him to digitally enhanced cats. Joaquin Phoenix gives a magnificent performance, camp in the best swords and sandals tradition, throwing childish fits when he doesn't get his way, sporting marvellously gothic eyeliner (Romans vs Goths, you see), scheming elaborate punishments for his big sister, which, for him, unlike the rest of us, who get our hair pulled, can actually, horribly, be realised.It's also nice to see that the hackneyed tide of postmodernism has been stemmed Canute-like, and a complex period in Roman history, with its plagues, revolts, tyrannies and back-room intrigues and murders can be 'crystallised' in a young boy's feeling unloved by his father.  Haven't we all felt this melancholy burden at one time or another, the failure to do what is right, honourable and Stoic, when ambition and privilege seem much more immediately rewarding?Add to this the accursed, tragic flaws of incest and worse (the difference between mad tyrant and noble hero must always be expressed in terms of neurotic sexuality and fertility-turned-ascetic renunciation), and you have a truly harassed, 'modern' hero, well supported by a ripe mixture of theatrical greats (Derek Jacobi) and former 60s icons (Oliver Reed, David Hemmings - is this Scott's THE LIMEY?).  He gets to watch some champion gladiating too.Of course, a film of this stature, size and scope must inevitably have its longueurs, here an elaborate sub-plot involving Russell Crowe, an inexorable melange of MAD MAX/BRAVEHEART (noble hero turned insane revenger after wife and family slaughtered; the bleak landscapes witnessing vastly scaled pub brawls; the lengthy, dimly lit, self-agonising indoor scenes, as a 'man' debates within himself his 'man'liness and duty; the loaded dichotomy between caricatured, vicious Imperials and unswervingly decent warrior; buddy-buddy development; Godardian, alienating, swelling score) and SPARTACUS (the violent gladiator scenes; the chinned sincerity; the captive peasant taking on the might of the Roman Empire; the structural homophobia).Crowe is a revelation - and reveals a hitherto unmined talent for comedy and parody.  Of course, this works because, like Leslie Nielsen, he marshalls a tautly disciplined straight face, but his clenched surliness, his Heston-like intergrity, his attempt to absorb the Stoic precepts of Marcus Aurelius (his scenes with Richard Harris are worthy of that masterpiece oof classical epics, CARRY ON CLEO), his reciting dialogue Abrahams-Zucker-Abrahams would have been proud to have written, are so funny (the scene where he rises off the ground of the auditorium to 'meet' his family is pure comic genius), so expertly pomposity-bursting, so winding up the pretensions of an entire genre, I emerged from the film with great respect for this stunningly versatile, deceptive actor.He couldn't have done it, though, without the help of Ridley Scott, essaying another mass culture in decline, who has bravely exorcised the complexities, ambiguities and enigmas of BLADE RUNNER to create an admirably simplistic epic, to abandon the weight of historical validity in favour of Boys' Own fantasy.  It would have been easy with this budget to create a teeming, living, authentic Rome, but Scott the postmodernist recognises the impossibility of this project, and, in an act of avant-garde innovation, hangs his drama on a handful of geometric signifiers, with little relation to any reality beyond the drawing board.There has been an extraordinary , and for me higly promising, strain in modern Hollywood filmmaking (eg TITANIC, THE PHANTOM MENACE), in which the new digital technology is not used to create novel, vast, convincing, strange worlds, but to elucidate the principles of Brechtian epic theatre, to foreground artificiality, implausibility, soullessness, encouraging the audience out of the narrative, to stand back and reflect on issues such as the construction of history, mass spectacle etc.  The dreams of the New Wave may finally have come to fruition.Like most films of this type, GLADIATOR is about a hero who is too good for his society, who cannot live in it.  But is he?  The absence of historical verity in the story set me thinking to about what Scott was trying to say. Because the film is a story about a man who lets his family die, who isn't there for them.  This is a curious hero to celebrate, though appropriate in an age where fathers often abandon their families, even to the extent of not paying alimony.  After Maximus (Scott must have been a Monty Python fan) sees the charred crucified bodies, the film goes momentarily into dream mode.  But does it ever come out of it?  This is a story that is full of doubles, strange correspondances, mirror scenes; it thoroughly interrogates the nature of family, and finally reaches a ritual climax in which both sides of the same coin (sons) wipe each other out, like Gothic doppelgangers.  Is the whole film Maximus's guilty dream, about guilt, emasculation, eternal torture over failure, the descent into bestiality? Is it a theme of America's guilt over slavery and subsequent race traumas, or a renunciation of them (both whites and blacks are slaves here).  Whatever. This is the first great comedy of the millennium.",Gladiator
180,FlickJunkie-2,An epic masterpiece that lives up to the hype.,10,3 December 2000,"`Gladiator' is one of those rare blockbusters that actually lives up to the hype.  Produced in the mold of old fashioned Hollywood epics like Ben-Hur, Cleopatra and Spartacus, this film was every bit as spectacular as they used to make them in the heyday of the studios.  With a lavish budget and an eye for detail, director Ridley Scott (`Alien', `Blade Runner', `GI Jane') combines the splendor of ancient Rome (brought to life in stunning detail through awesome, computer generated visual effects) with a human story of gripping intensity, to create one of the most complete entertainment experiences I can remember in quite some time.The story involves the fall from grace of Maximus, a famous general of the Northern Army whom Marcus Aurelius favors over his own son for succession to the throne.  When Marcus dies before making this wish known, his son Commodus is elevated and orders Maximus killed.  Maximus escapes his executioners, but is taken as a slave and turned into a Gladiator.  This sets up a dramatic confrontation between Maximus and Commodus in the Roman Coliseum.This is an ingenious meld of fantasy and reality that plays fast and loose with historical fact.  Marcus Aurelius was, in fact, a roman Caesar during the period in question.  His portrayal as a kind and thoughtful leader was accurate.  He would come to be known historically as the `Philosopher King' and the `Benevolent Dictator'.  He was also a great military leader and conqueror.  Commodus was altered considerably from historical accounts, but the essence of his evil and egocentric personality was well represented. By historical accounts, Commodus was fair and blond.  He was not the sniveling brat who avoided battle as he was portrayed.  In fact, he fought by his father's side for the last five years of Marcus Aurelius' life.  Nor was he passed over by his father for succession.  Marcus was proud of Commodus and named him Caesar at the age of five.  He publicly named him as his successor at seventeen.It is universally accepted that Marcus Aurelius died of plague in March of 180 A.D. and not as depicted in the film.  There is no historical record of any general named Maximus.  Commodus died in a carefully planned coup d'etat, strangled in his bath by a gladiator named Narcissus.  This is also at odds with events depicted in the film.Despite these inaccuracies, much of this film maintained a great deal of historical authenticity.  Commodus did indeed cease the conquering wars and focused on gaining favor with `the mob', a derisive term used by the Patricians to describe the masses.  He would give away food and other gifts and hold extensive games to keep them amused.  He was also wildly popular for personally fighting gladiators in the arena, just as depicted.  He was a ruthless dictator, who had numerous attempts made on his life, and he routinely had Senators and other enemies executed.  His was a reign of terror and debauchery that rivaled that of Caligula.The most impressive feat of historical authenticity was the computer generated views of Ancient Rome.  These were done in meticulous detail and consistent with what is know from records and ruins.  The costumes were also precise and authentic, as were the battle tactics seen in the opening battle.  This film brings Ancient Rome to life in a way that is more realistic than ever before.The story was a cross between the story of Commodus and the story of Spartacus.  Spartacus was a roman soldier who deserted and who was taken into slavery, later becoming a gladiator and then the leader of a slave uprising against Rome.  (For those who enjoyed `Gladiator' and have never seen `Spartacus' starring Kirk Douglas, I highly recommend that you dig it out of the rental stacks.)This film was a directorial masterpiece.  Though the battles were intense, the graphic violence was understated without losing effect.  Scott uses strobe photography to intensify the battle scenes rather than showing a great deal of gore.  Scott chose to emphasize the human story, binding us to Maximus emotionally through excellent character development.  This is a classic struggle of good against evil that turned the viewer into a devoted member of the Roman mob.  It is a story that hooks you and doesn't let you go.  Scott understood the importance of this and made sure that the human story didn't get lost in the spectacle.The acting was superb.  Russell Crowe is becoming bigger than life as a box office attraction, and with good reason.  His performance was awesome, offering both physical and emotional prowess.  Joaquin Phoenix was also deliciously evil as the self tormented Commodus.  This breakout performance for Phoenix is Oscar worthy in a supporting role.  At seventy years old, Richard Harris dusted himself off for yet another powerful supporting role as Marcus Aurelius.The sound on the DVD was excellent and it included an entire second disk of extras, including an interesting featurette on the making of the film.  It was enjoyable to have an opportunity to see another side of Russell Crowe. He always plays such dour characters that it is fun to see him continually mugging for the camera and telling jokes.  It is refreshing to see that after all the fame he has enjoyed, he doesn't take himself at all seriously.This film was off the rating charts.  I deducted two points for historical inaccuracies and still gave it a 10/10.  They don't make films like this anymore.  Don't miss it.",Gladiator
181,redkiwi,Scott classic!,8,28 May 2000,"I've never been a great Ridley Scott fan.  Anyone who can make GI Jane has a lot to answer for, but this absolutely excellent - the acting is brilliant (Crowe particularly), the script is OK and the effects are awesome, especially the coliseum scenes.The only compliant is that is drags on a little long.Crowe - a New Zealander who started in acting in Australia, got his break in the USA and plays a Spaniard in Rome - is certainly showing his versatility, despite his accent occasionally being out of place.Joaquin Phoenix is also good, and undoubtedly the least irritating member of that family!  Richard Harris did well, and the Oliver Reed pieces were also good.  Despite his notoriety for his drinking, people actually tend to forget that Reed was a talented actor, and it is well displayed here.",Gladiator
182,Bogmeister,"Roar of Battle, the Roar of Crowds",9,5 September 2005,"Ridley Scott brings his stylistic sense to the historical epic in this recreation of the Roman Empire at its zenith. This time frame is actually ahead of the usual one with Julius Caesar that we're mostly used to seeing and actually takes place, I believe, during the same time as the elder epic ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""(64). By the title and the hearsay, you'd expect the story to revolve around gladiatorial combat in the arena, but though some of the significant scenes do take place there, the scope encompasses all of Rome and its surrounding provinces. The beginning is a lengthy sequence depicting a final battle in the war against Germania, a brutal & staggering depiction of two armies in combat. It's here that director Scott presents the flavor of what the viewer will become accustomed to as the picture progresses: important people, important events, important decisions - set to an epic scale, of course.But it's the people portion of the formula that dominates what could have been just another epic. Maximus (Crowe), a Roman general at the start of the pic, makes it clear very early where his priorities lie: with his wife & son, whom he hasn't seen in over two years. Yet, he's also intensely loyal to the empire and the emperor (Harris). We realize he's caught between the two responsibilities at this early stage of the film and it's not a simple dilemma; priorities must be weighed, possible impacts both personal & political. Although a decision is taken out of his hands, we see that it's not a simple solution of 'well, i'll go home' as he desired which would have dictated his actions. There's real intelligence to the script by this point. Crowe won the Oscar for his part and though he probably was more deserving for a couple of other films, it's easy to see how he carried the picture here.The supporting cast is first rate. Phoenix as Commodus, the new emperor who takes the decision out of Maximus' hands, does not come across as a standard villain, despite his actions (patricide, lusting for his sister, sadistic murder). You see him make revolting faces during the gladiatorial games, reveling in the blood spilled, and of course you think, what a grotesque villain. Yet, in other scenes he is quite pitiful - it's astonishing we can feel any sympathy for this wretch, but Phoenix plays the 'daddy should have loved me' angle to the hilt - and it works. The no.1 position in the empire dictates that the holder cannot trust anyone, it's so true; no one seems more alone than Phoenix throughout the film. Oliver Reed hams it up a bit as an arena entertainer, but it is Reed, a fitting final role. There's a lot a class spread out among the remainder of the cast - Harris, Jacobi, Hemmings all lend some gravitas, and Connie Nielsen is very good in a truly regal role.Since much of this film involves gladiatorial combat, I must at least mention the fighting scenes in the various arenas. They are very well done. But they're probably not the main reason to see the picture.",Gladiator
183,lawprof,"""Commodus has issues.""",6,15 February 2004,"My teenage son wanted to see this film so we bought the DVD version which offers extra features including commentary by director Ridley Scott.  I hadn't been interested in catching this Roman a clef flick in the theaters and two and a half hours of watching it last night underscored my original reluctance.It isn't a bad movie but virtuous hero against mad Roman emperor has been done before in literature (from Shakespeare to Graves) and often on film. Russell Crowe's effort as Maximus (Max the General) is good but hardly empire-shaking.  Richard Harris as the aging emperor is a nice almost swan song for a fine actor who, for a change, doesn't shout.My son thought that Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, lacked a number of important qualities.  When he comes on big time to his sister, Lucilla, Connie Nielsen, he remarked, ""Commodus has issues.""  Commodus is everything a viewer expects from a big time villain: scheming, madness and - of course - a yellow streak down his back as wide as the screen.The big arena fights are exciting for a while but how many heads can be loped off before a viewer has seen it all too often.  The events try to recreate faithfully the exciting games once put on by the Roman Gladiatorial League with a cast of thousands (or some darn good computer work).The commentary accompanying the deleted scenes is amusing.  Director Scott explains why he left out a scene of lions turned loose on kneeling Christians by explaining that the animals were too passive as they went to lunch.""Gladiator"" is a huge money-grosser proving that this formulaic and potted snapshot of a crucial era in western history can't be reproduced too often.6/10.",Gladiator

187,khatcher-2,"Ben Hur, Barrabas, Spartacus, even Braveheart .",6,7 September 2003,"..............come to mind when watching this epic-style Roman Empire story. And I do not grumble about the story, nor even of its telling. Ridley Scott is obviously a highly professional director; the screenplay is worthy of the film, and the photography is frequently wonderful. Some of the sets are superb.My grudge, I suppose, is that with so much Hollywood razzamatazz, I was falsely led into expecting something different from Russell Crowe. His performance is good, or even better. But so good as to win an Oscar? So be it: Hollywood criteria once again goes astray. Well, anyway, it is all good for the box-office. Do not get me wrong: the film relates its story well, such that at over 150 minutes by no means did it seem too long. Battle scenes and Gladiators in the Coliseum were well filmed. Richard Harris's interpretation stands out head and shoulders above everybody else. What really makes me gripe is the music: it practically ruined the whole film. It seems that Zimmer `borrowed' (if not plagiarized) anything he could get his hands on, with pieces which sounded like replicas inspired by people ranging from Gustav Holst and Andrew Lloyd-Webber, via Vangelis and even a touch of Richard Wagner. I suppose a grandiose-intentioned epic film required music of the same proportions, but Zimmer was not inspired and has never much inspired me in his other films, especially for TV series.A little below seven out of ten for this one, despite the several good points.",Gladiator

Commodus then arranges to have both Maximus and his family killed so that he can usurp the throne. However, Maximus survives and is taken into custody as a slave and then turned into a Gladiator known only as the Spaniard. As fate would have it, his group of Gladiators find their way into Rome where Commodus has opened the Colosseum for 150 days of games - leading to the much anticipated and climatic final confrontation between the Emperor and the Gladiator who defied him.This is such a good movie. The cinematography was excellent, that coupled with the amazing soundtrack really pull you in. The story is very well crafted and acted with great skill.

190,oOoBarracuda,Gladiator,9,11 April 2016,"Epicly April got off to a, well, epic start with my viewing of Gladiator. The Academy Award Best Picture winner for 2000 was definitely grand in scale. Ridley Scott has turned in an illustrious career making impressive films, and Gladiator certainly belongs in this category. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix lead the cast in this tale of revenge against a corrupt Emporer. A gripping tale of avenging the death of one's family, Gladiator keeps audiences on the edge of their seats through the entire 2.5-hour film. Maximus (Russel Crowe) is a adored General for the Roman army. He is even loved by the aging Emporer Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). When Aurelius tells his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) that he intends to crown Maximus Emporer over his own blood, Commodus takes this as the ultimate betrayal. After murdering his own father, Commodus assumes power, as no one knew of Marcus Aurelius' intentions to crown Maximus. Commodus then goes on to condemn Maximus to death and sends henchmen to murder his family. Defying odds, Maximus escapes his execution and hurries back in an attempt to save his wife and child. Too late to save them, Maximus is taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator. Maximus gets through his days by hoping that he will eventually be able to exact revenge against Commodus and fulfill his own Emporer, Marcus Aurelius', dying wish. The day finally comes in which Maximus' gladiator troupe is called to fight in the coliseum of Emporer Commodus to participate in a marathon of gladiator challenges. Joining together with Senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) who wishes to bring democracy to Rome, and Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) daughter to Marcus Aurelius and sister to Commodus who bore Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) heir to the throne of his Uncle and is deathly afraid of her brother, the gang of misfits attempts to bring about the demise of Commodus. Gladiator looks like the spectacle you would imagine it to look like. The sounds and score were perfect for the film and made you feel like you needed to wipe the sand out of your eyes because you were so involved in the action. My favorite part, like others I'm sure, was the scene with Russel Crowe fighting the tigers in the coliseum. The scene looked like reality and thankfully wasn't bogged down with CGI. Russel Crowe played the brooding warrior exceptionally and was matched in talent with Joaquin Phoenix's sanctimonious turn as the self- righteous Emporer. Gladiator was a real tour-de-force as far as the acting was concerned. Another stand out was the stark colors sprinkled throughout the film, especially in the costumes. Janty Yates certainly pulled all the stops designing the costumes worn in this epic and was more than worthy of her Oscar for Best Costume Design. It is the scenes in the coliseum that show just how many extras were used in this movie and acts as further proof that Ridley Scott more than deserved the gold statuette for Best Director he took home from the 2000 Oscar ceremony. Everything came together so well in Gladiator that I can more than see why audiences and critics alike have few negative words for this film. Gladiator is driven by the vehicle of revenge. Maximus wants nothing more than to kill Commodus, both because he is responsible for the death of Maximus' own wife and child, and because it was the wish of Marcus Aurelius for Commodus to die and Maximus to take the thrown. Seeking revenge gives Maximus' life purpose after his escape from death and the loss of his family. Maximus' laser focus on revenge fuels every aspect of Maximus' day and one is left to wonder if this idea of revenge turns into an obsession and if it is healthy. Granted, Maximus gives his life purpose with the goal of revenge, but he is set upon killing which never seems to right any wrongs. The theme works in this film and is paced so well that the audience is engaged throughout the entire film. I am happy that a month of viewing epics had brought me Gladiator, a film I am guaranteed to see again and again.",Gladiator
191,Aylmer,"good viewing, but FAR from great.",4,9 June 2000,"At least it was better than that 13th Warrior ""movie"" that came out last year... it's actually quite entertaining at time, but Gladiator is much too sloppy it seat itself on the top 100 list!Beginning with a badly edited battle scene (what's with all the close-ups of swords clinging and such...  I can't tell what the hell's going on!) and a cameo by an very, very old-looking Richard Harris, Gladiator finally shifts into high-gear when the guy starts to do his Gladiator-thing.  The problem is that it takes too long to get there, and when the film's there they ruin it with ye standard old ""revenge"" plot - basically the same thing that brought down THE CROW.Russel Crow is wooden, but there's some good supporting performances by Oliver Reed (his last performance), Derek Jakobi, and even a small role for seldom-seen actor David Hemmings (from HEROIN BUSTERS, DEEP RED, and SWINDLE) as a wig-wearing ring announcer.  Ridley Scott's ""dark"" Alien/Blade Runner moody photography is out of place in the many interior and (in one case) exterior shots of Rome... which looks a bit too Computer Graphicky to buy.  The high points come with the gladiatorial combat, which looks good and has some decent ideas and bloodletting, but is confusingly shot and edited.  One thing I really didn't like was Joaquin Phoenix as the whiney bad guy... how would he have intimidated anybody? The ending is highly unplausable, not to mention historically inaccurate. It's enjoyable at times, but is an overall groan-inducing experience.  Not Scott's worst work, though not his best either.",Gladiator

It's a stirring story of revenge against the backdrop of Roman glory, with a game played off between the stoicism of Maximus against the cruel envy of Commodus over the people's adoration. It becomes as much about the back-alley politicking and public perceptions as it does the fights within the arena itself. Maximus is the pinnacle of masculinity and heroism against Commodus' despicable antagonist, an underdog against powers greater than himself. And when Maximus gets his revenge and collapses on the floor to meet his wife and son in the afterlife, it hits with the emotional weight it has earned.

201,CinematicInceptions,Solidly executed with a good story and the mark of a classic action film.,8,16 October 2014,"This is a movie that can be enjoyed in a variety of ways. It can be appreciated for its story, lived intensely through its action scenes, emotionally experienced through the deeply established main characters, or soaked in. It is not a movie that leaves you smiling, but the action scenes can make it kind of fun if you don't care for any kind of stories. The story is very solid with good characters, but you don't need to follow the story to enjoy the fight scenes. The inverse can also be said in that the story can still be enjoyed by those who don't like the action. All three of the main elements of the movie, the execution, action, and story, are spiced up with diversity. The story has politics, emotional conflicts, character personalities, and practical issues introduced to it. This is exemplified by the political issues that arise from Commodus taking the place of his father instead of Maximus: Lucilla being torn between her husband/brother, Maximus, and her son: Maximus keeping his dignity when becoming a slave; and his simple wish to return to his family and farm. The action visits multiple regions with epic battles, guerrilla style raids, one on one combat, and of course gladiator fighting. It is intense, but the shots are fairly quick so the gore does not have an overly painful effect on the audience (think high-speed sword fights over extended torture scenes). The execution has classic feels to it, but is rather ahead of its time for the most part. The cinematography is very good when it displays the battles, Maximus' fantasies of home, and the snake-like workings of Commodus. Plus, the visual quality and lighting is sharp throughout. The delivery of speech has a dramatic tone to it, but is also realistic at most points. The film score is kind of caught in the transition period from Hans Zimmer's current style and the John Williams style that it has in Crimson Tide. As to the characters, the main roles are well played and well developed. Maximus is not what you would call a round character. His main quality is that he is able to gain people's respect in his various roles. Whether he is leading a trained army or the scum of the kingdom, he is able to get people to obey, respect, and treat him with an almost child-like love, looking up to him as a role model. Russel Crowe's acting is good enough to not be criticized, but not good enough to be remarkable (though his delivery of the ""My name is Gladiator . . . and I will have my vengeance . . ."" quote is very striking). Commodus makes an excellent villain because at heart he is just a whiny little kid that has to have his way. His ""am I not merciful"" rant is a great summary of his personality. By the time he reaches his demise, he has acted so villainously that it is an indisputable fact that he had it coming to him. Joaquin Phoenix embodies his character quite convincingly, especially in the scene where he is forced to spare Maximus' life despite his own desires. Lucilla plays a strong female character who advocates justice despite its consequences. She kind of gets caught in the middle of everything that happens without a political escape route, but manages to sort of come out on top at the end. The other supporting roles like Juba and Marcus Aurelius add to the story without adding to the confusion of who is who and why did he or she do that. I think Juba's last line of ""Now we are free,"" is a great way to end the movie, because it kind of gives a tangible positive outcome of Maximus' death. The song by Lisa Gerrard that goes with the quote is an excellent piece of music to close out the movie. On a slight side note, I feel that the death of the main character at the end is sort of a sign that a movie is striving to become a classic. The same scenario comes up in Dead Poet's Society, and neither death is implausible or poorly portrayed, but it kind of forces you to take the movie up to that point more seriously. I'm not saying it is bad to include that element, but there are other ways to make a movie a classic and this movie will be one and would be even if Maximus' death had not been included. If you are considering whether Gladiator is worth a watch, I would say that is should satisfy as long as you're a fan of general action. There is more to the movie than the fight scenes, but there are enough of them that anyone who doesn't like action won't enjoy it. As for humorous elements, you'll get more laughs out of a blank sheet of paper (though if you've seen Nacho Libre, there are several moments where you can't resist pulling out a few quotes from the Jack Black wrestling comedy). As stated before the execution and story should satisfy most and is subject to very little criticism. So if you like action and a high-quality watch, set aside an evening or two for this movie. Overall Rating: 8.6/10",Gladiator
202,jhaggardjr,"Good movie, but a great one?",7,16 March 2001,"""Gladiator"", the movie favored to win the Oscar for Best Picture this coming March 25, is an epic movie that I found to be just good. I didn't think it was a great one like most people thought it was. Certainly not as great as ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"", which ""Gladiator"" is no doubt inspired from. The good things about this movie are the two main performances by Russell Crowe (Maximus) and Joaquin Phoenix (Commodus), the action scenes in the Roman Colosseum, and the beautiful film score. All those elements get high marks. The cinematography, editing, and production design are very good as well. But if there's one element that keeps this movie from being a great film is the lackluster special effects. The effects aren't all that great here. Even though they're not bad at all times, there were some effect shots that looked obviously phony. That shouldn't happen in a film like this. Nevertheless, if you like historical epic movies, then you'll probably like ""Gladiator"". I was just a little disappointed that it wasn't the great film I thought it would be.*** (out of four)",Gladiator
203,SKG-2,Entertaining epic,8,8 May 2000,"I can't say I'm a real big fan of what is known as the ""sword and sandal"" genre.  Admittedly, I haven't seen too many of these medieval epics, but I can only think of two I liked(not counting Monty Python's LIFE OF BRIAN, which spoofed the genre); BEN-HUR and SPARTACUS.  The former, despite an annoying lead performance by Charlton Heston, had taste and craftsmanship, the latter, despite a somewhat one-note performance by Kirk Douglas, had irony and intelligence.  The others all seemed melodramatic.  But Ridley Scott's new film shows there's life in this genre yet.Admittedly, the film does suffer in comparison in one respect; Scott seems less comfortable with the talking scenes and the backroom politics, as it were, than, say, Stanley Kubrick was in SPARTACUS.  All the scenes with Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier, and Peter Ustinov were, in that film, equally as compelling as the battle scenes.  Whereas in Scott's film, while he's cast some good actors like Joaquim Phoenix, Connie Nielson, and Derek Jacobi, and they respond with good performances(in particular, Phoenix, an underrated actor, and not the obvious choice as the bad guy), you can sense his need to get back to the action.Fortunately, the action is all well done; while it's clear Scott is trying to have it both ways(make entertaining spectacle which comments on the need for entertaining spectacle), he stages it so well we don't tend to worry about that.  Also, he's helped mightily by the casting of Russell Crowe in the lead role.  Crowe couldn't play a false note if he tried, and he brings a lot to a pretty standard action hero here.  As with THE INSIDER, he's playing another person who takes a stand he didn't think he had to, and he leads by example, rather than bluster.  Overall, while I'm not a big fan of the genre, this is a fine example of it.",Gladiator
204,chaswe-28402,Ridley sure can direct,10,23 July 2018,"Re-watching this after several years has caused me to revise my rating upwards. I must have been over-influenced by reading the silly one-star reviews. This is an inventive and fictional tale, set in imperial Rome, with one or two actual historical characters. Unlike phony Braveheart, it in no way sets out to distort actual history. It is exceptionally skilfully directed, and the narrative never lets up. Ridley seems always to get the best from his actors. One of the least boring epics I've ever watched. Ridley Scott can turn his hand to any genre. Miles ahead of Kubrick: it's as if he is saying: I see what you're at, Stan, let me show you how to do it. Sometimes it steers dangerously close to excessive emotion, but time and again avoids bathos. Excellent script and dialogue. Visually masterful. Great movie.",Gladiator
205,AKS-6,Brilliant acting,7,7 June 2000,"I expected much before I saw this film and as every film fan knows; you should never expect things before you see a film. So, I didn't like ""Gladiator"" as much as I thought I would, but I still think it's a good film. It's interesting, the action scenes are great (the opening battle scene is reminiscent of both ""Braveheart"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""), the drama quite interesting, and the acting brilliant. Of course, Russell Crowe has never been better (I haven't seen ""The Insider yet, though), and we all know how good he was in e.g. ""L.A. Confidential."" Joaquin Phoenix doesn't play a very likable character, Commodus is a pathetic loser, but he does a good job with it anyway. Recommended. (7/10)",Gladiator

But we're still talking about top-notch entertainment. Don't watch this film in a non THX/DTS theater, you'll miss half the experience!",Gladiator
207,chrisbrown6453,Thank you Ridley Scott.,8,8 June 2001,"Gladiator is a truly great depiction of an important part of early Roman Empire. Yes, Gladiator will probably win the Oscar of Best Picture of 2000, but should it?  While I agree that watching it was a great pleasure, I am not convinced that it was the best movie made last year.  In any other year, not containing a film named Cast Away', Gladiator would get my absolute vote, however in the interest of keeping this review to the movie at hand, I will not name which one I feel should win.Viewing Gladiator was definitely a spectacle everyone should endure. It has everything any good movie should; an original story, great acting, and truly awe-inspiring direction.  To be transported to a world that existed over 1800 years ago, and experience the very same excitement the Romans were able to enjoy is just incredible.  Ridley Scott struck did very well with his direction of Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Neilsen, and Oliver Reed (who unfortunately suffered a fatal heart attack during filming).  Scotts' ability to `see' the action in his head, and create the effect for the cameras is wonderful.  This is a far different epic than Alien', and far better than Hannibal'. 
Russell Crowe is fabulous as Maximus Meridius, the great soldier planning to return to his home after fighting his last battle only to find himself thrust between the dead kings will for him to become the new king, and Commudus, the son of the former king wanting him to stay and fight for him. Crowe is perfect in this role, he is strong, rugged looking, and has become quite a good actor since his days in The Quick and the Dead' and the awful Virtuosity'.Joaquin Phoenix is magnificent in his role as Commudus.   Only recently have I noticed what great acting skills Phoenix possesses, and how well he transforms into such diverse characters, such the same can be said of Ewan McGregor and his diverse roles in Trainspotting', Little Voice' and Star Wars: Episode I'.  Phoenix's ability to present himself in such a devious and hateful aspect is awe-inspiring.  As the sister of Commudus, Lucilla (Connie Neilsen) has to play both devoted to her brother, and sympathetic to Maximus.  Neilsen pulls this off beautifully and she is very convincing in her role.The story is beautifully written, and there is never a dull moment.  After I viewed the film for the first time I felt that the gladiator fight scenes were too far apart, and not enough of them were in the movie.  However, a very good friend of mine, we shall call him Michael DeZubiria (check out his reviews), felt it necessary to explain to me that Gladiator is not just a story about fighting, but a story about the life struggles of one man and his quest to avenge the brutal killing of his family. 
Now, while I admit that I liked this film, I am not ready, nor will I ever be ready, to call it the best movie of 2000 (see my Cast Away review).  I do not want to take anything away from Gladiator, it's just that there was a more original, creative film in 2000.",Gladiator
208,acedj,Another Ridley Scott masterpiece,9,5 November 2019,"There is very little fault one can find in this film. It is the story of Maximus, a roman general who is betrayed by the son of his Caesar. After escaping execution, Maximus ends up fighting as a gladiator, with an eye for vengeance. Russell Crowe is magnificent in this role. He brings such poise and humility to the character, it is impossible not to be sympathetic. Joaquin Phoenix is equally as excellent in his role, and the polar opposite of Maximus. I would not only recommend this movie, but I would further insist that you watch the director's cut. It comes in at just under three hours of run time, but it will certainly not feel like it. I would put this in my top 10 movies you should see before you die list.",Gladiator
209,bat-5,Spectacular!,8,9 May 2000,"Ridley Scott has breathed new life into the sword and sandal epic with Gladiator.  Using modern visual effects, Gladiator shows us a Rome that hasn't been seen since, well Roman times.  There is a thriving metropolis and at the center of this mass of humanity is the coloseium.  Ridley Scott's films are wonders of art direction and costume design and Gladiator is no exception. The sumptuousness of Rome in its heyday is wonderful to look at.  With all of the eye candy that Scott gives you, you almost forget that there is a story unfolding, and it's quite a story.  Russell Crowe gives a strong performance as Maximus, the disgraced Roman general. Juaquin Phoenix is perfectly sniveling and underhanded as the newly crowned emperor Commodus. There are scenes of quiet treachery and intrigue and then there are scenes of blood stirring combat in the arena. Gladiator is an epic that spares no expense in giving you thrills from ancient Rome.",Gladiator
210,AvidClimber,Gladiator — A violent and grandiose clash of titans in the ancient grimy world or Rome,10,21 January 2013,"Gladiator has it all. A great story that, even with the old revenge idea, will pick you up and plunge you right in. Gloriously grandiose shots that will fill your eyes and your imagination. Acting that will never take you for granted and just give you real emotions. Dialogs that are well thought, and will only be simple if it fits the scene or the character. Smooth editing and excellent score to be bettered only by the best. And, finally, action with grimy characters that gives this movie the heartbeat of a titan.The opening scene is particularly exceptional. The intrigue gets going pretty quickly putting our unwilling hero in a real and fatal mess. Each piece of the drama is put in place carefully, until everything comes together and the clash happens. It's one of Ridley Scott's great movies.Russel Crowe is the perfect hero, Joaquin Phoenix is truly mad, and both are irresistibly aimed at each other. Connie Nielsen play a very frightened sister that's at the same time courageous, yet worried about her son.This time, I tried listening to it with a very critical eye and I found only the last moment of clarity of Maximus, when he gives his last order, to be a weak and somewhat artificial moment. Beyond that, unlike him, I would have bent my neck right away, and plotted after, but that's a personal decision. It would have killed the whole paradigm right away and made me less of righteous a hero than him.Anyway you dice it or slice it, it's a must see, unless you have difficulty with violence.",Gladiator
211,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Swords, sandals, battlefields and an amazingly poignant struggle at its core  it has all you could ask for in an epic Roman saga, plus well-placed flair and fury.",9,26 August 2006,"""They tell me your son squealed like a girl when they nailed him to the cross. And your wife moaned like a whore when they ravaged her again and again... and again.""Gladiator is an amazing story of revenge. It is a story of one man's struggle to challenge the emperor of Rome, wearing nothing but slaves' attire, being sold as a gladiator for the people's morbid amusement, and seeking vengeance for having his family murdered through these 'games'. It is also a political story about justice in the midst of corruption, interwoven with swords, sandals and battlefields á la epic war saga. This, my friends, is a true underdog story with a hero so poignant that it is impossible not to be engrossed in his struggle.Whatever _I_ will say about this film will simply be semi-coherent, rambling praise as I like the works of Ridley Scott so much. However, far from everyone liked Gladiator (2000). Roger Ebert disliked it. Moviegoers criticized it for being unoriginal  a mild rip-off of Spartacus (1960) and the likes. It may have been warmly received by the Academy, but audiences were very divided when it was released. I'd like to think that I am usually able to see things from other people's perspective, but just this once, how could you not be entertained?So although I usually trust Roger Ebert a great deal, I have absolutely no idea what he was on about in panning the film for its gloomy tone and ""muddy, fuzzy and indistinct"" skies. Maybe he simply forgot to clean his widescreen TV, because the Gladiator I know sees hugely epic games under a brilliant blue sky in the coliseum, a glorious tournament that is so entertaining because of its flair. The final battle has ROSES RAINING FROM THE SKY! It does not get more vivid or colourful than that.These battle-scenes of Gladiator are, of course, extremely well tended to by Ridley Scott who is the master at crafting epic war scenarios (see, I told you fanboy-praise would sneak its way in!). The patient, slow pacing of the film seems to take a sudden halt here, and then fast-forward in an amazingly rapid-fire pace with quick shots, swinging swords, vivid skies and a great score by Hans Zimmer to further emphasize the dramatic mood. The very culmination of this is not at the end, but rather early. It is the moment that Maximus (a superb Russell Crowe) removes his helmet, reveals his identity and faces the emperor, after a long and ferocious battle. It is a scene so poignant that I always wish it would have been saved until later on in the film, thereby giving it even more weight. But no matter, because rest assured that it is goosebumps-inducing enough.A gloriously entertaining, heartfelt and carefully crafted war adventure by Ridley Scott in which little feels missing or incomplete. What more could you ask for? Great acting from the cast, I suppose  well, this is also present in Gladiator. Best of all, the actors have good dialogue to work with so they don't choke on the dated lines. Russell Crowe propels this film with his heroic personality, Connie Nielsen adds introspective depth, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as the twisted but idealist emperor Commodurus. 9/10",Gladiator
212,lagudafuad,here is a roman classic,8,20 December 2012,"The movie moves in the realm of depression and just stays there. Gladiator shows the things that pushed an innocent hero to the point that death seemed like a relief from all that the world has taken from him. Maximus the main protagonist of the movie was portrayed by Russell Crowe in such a talented yet distinctive fashion that you do nothing but bow to the way Maximus handled his trials and tests to come out victorious at the end.Filming took place between January and May of1999 and the locations used were Bourne Woods, near Farnham Surrey in England, Ouarzazate Morocco and Fort Ricasoli Malta.The movie plot is about a loyal Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe), who is betrayed when the Emperor's son, Commodus, murders his father to become Emperor of Rome himself, and burns down and kills Maximus family. After everything is lost Maximus is reduced to slavery and he having one determination, revenge, rose through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena, all in the hope of getting back at the man who killed his family and Emperor. Based squarely on a pitch by David Franzoni, who worked with Spielberg in Amistad, Ridley Scott was approached to make a movie from Franzoni's original final draft but he had the whole script re-written by John Logan who was the person that added the death of Maximus family, to create a lonely soldier with nothing to lose, but Franzoni was brought back as problems start to erupt in the re-writes, Frazoni did all he could to get the script back to the original draft. More issues sprung up, when Russell Crowe almost caused a total re-write of the script, whenever he asked questions he demanded answers and if the answers were not favourable, the script had to be re-worked.The movie can be said to have drawn plot from two older movies, The Fall of the Roman Empire and Spartacus both of which were done in the 60s. A lot of the plot foundation, like the murder of the emperor by his son who wanted to marry his sister, who (Sister) was in love with a General can be said to be taken from the movie The Fall of the Roman Empire. The gladiator aspect of this movie can be said to have been gotten from the movie Spartacus.Gladiator was a critical and financial success and it won 5 Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards, the awards were Best Picture, Best Actor (Russell Crowe), Best Visual Effects, Best Costume Design and Best sound.Gladiator is a classic movie that gives you the fun to see the Roman Empire as some believe it was, rough and full of politics, here is another shelf nominee.www.lagsreviews.com",Gladiator

214,alicecbr,Parallels with the Degeneration of our American Empire,7,10 February 2005,"This movie is rife with parallels to our own degenerating society. Will Durant in his ""Age of Faith"" points out that the republic of Rome segued into an Empire as the leaders became power mad, epitomized by Comitus, who killed his father, Marcus Aurelius (representing the fairer Caesars). These characters were composites of the Caesars who presided over the death of the Roman Empire, so like my country today. 'Comitus' refers to the elite, but weak aristocracy of patrician counts (comites). Notice: NASCAR? The chariot races with the blood lust quotient upped by having them run down the gladiators.Bush? Comitus, the degenerate overseer of the decline of the Roman Empire, who cleverly had the love of the masses by offering them the circuses of the gladiators being torn limb to limb by animals or killed by other gladiators (Boxing, anyone?)Dr. Dean? Maximum, the brave gladiator who alone stands against the wicked Comitus, who loves his country and dies for it in his fight with the cowardly Comitus. But gradually, his fellow gladiators follow his leadership as they recognize his bravery in speaking truth to power. As Bush stole the presidency twice, Comitus had to STAB Maximus before 'fighting' him in what appeared to be a fair match in the Coliseum (ref. also, Bush's receiver that tried to make the playing field even in the debates, and still failed). He, like Bush, could not win in a fair fight.Impotent Congress? ""The Senate, at Rome could deliberate, legislate, adjudicate, but always subject to the imperial veto; their legislative functions were largely appropriated by the ruler's advisory council, the sacrum consistorium principes. America, the Empire? In the view of the emperors, democracy had failed; it had carried liberty into license, and license into chaos. The system kept the Byzantine Empire in existence for a millennium, but at the cost of political stagnation, public atrophy, court conspiracies, wars of succession and a score of palace revolutions that gave the throne occasionally to competence, seldom to integrity, too often to an unscrupulous adventurer, an oligarchic cabal, or an IMPERIAL FOOL."" DurantHeaven? Elysian Fields, the after-life that encouraged people to risk their lives for glory on the battle field (Iraq), and in the Coliseum (NASCAR circuit, boxing ring)As blood lust feeds upon itself, so also the American masses with this movie.....up close and personal, degenerating into a tolerance of torture.

There's so much to recommend this - Lisa Gerrard & Hans Zimmer's iconic score, the canny casting of Joaquin Phoenix as a foil for Crowe; the realisation that I quote this film in everyday conversation far more than I thought I did. If it should have won the Oscars is a moot point - this is another of Ridley Scott's superb worldbuilding - one of his primary film-making skills, giving us a Rome that feels recognisable yet still a break from the cliché's that had seeped in to popular culture before this.

His rescue from the dead is enthralling, if only to be enslaved as a potential Gladiator whipping boy. His story of revenge, catapulting him to the grand arena, seems as inevitable as his determination is contagious.

Ridley Scott has put the emphasis on the visual and on the use of power and the use of the masses to sustain and control this power. Very clever, and ""Gladiator"" is an exceptionally powerful film, albeit a bit overlong and even slow at some points.The visuals are fantastic, I couldn't really see anything that revealed the ancient Rome to be a model or a computer simulation. The war scene and the fighting scenes are amazing, my guess is that the brutality shown here is a bit meeker than what the real thing must have been - the Romans were the worst kind of barbarians, civilized and advanced and yet thirsty for blood. But then again, maybe that was Rome's way of keeping their enormous population in check? Give them spectacles, give them something to shout at, to focus their frustration and anger at - and be sure to point that away from the emperor's palace.""Gladiator"" goes to considerable lengths to show how a weak emperor loses control over the crowds and how his vision of the empire crumbles before his eyes - this is all very well portrayed.",Gladiator
219,PudgyPandaMan,One of the best movies I've seen - especially among modern films,10,9 February 2009,"I typically prefer classic films because I, for one, don't think Hollywood makes movies like they used to. Plus, I think most modern films are heavy on the sex and foul language - and as a Christian, I find it offensive.So it is rare when Hollywood puts out not only a great film in terms of the quality of the story and the performances, but which also has very little language and no explicit sexual content (inspite of this being rated R but that is due to the violence).This movie did something that rarely happens with me in modern films in that it completely absorbed me into the time period, the location and the story. I felt somewhat transported for the entire length - which given its long running time, was quite a feat. It never once seemed to lag or get slow - but kept my complete attention. Not only that, but I have seen this film numerous times (probably at least 6 times) and it never fails to capture my complete attention - even though I know what is going to happen next. That is the sign of not only a great movie - but a MASTERPIECE in my opinion.Crowe's performance was amazing, but I'm a little surprised that he won, while Joaquin Phoenix was ROBBED. He was nominated, but lost to Benicio Del Torro for TRAFFIC. Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was so completely engrossing - the creep factor was exponential. I think his is one of the all time great villainous portrayals - but in ways that at times were so subtle that it made him even more despicable.I only had one mild complaint of the film which is I felt the past history between Lucilla and Maximus was not completely explained and I think would have enriched the understanding of the 2 characters.I own very few DVD's but this is one that we did end up getting since it never fails to deliver a completely absorbing experience - time after time!",Gladiator

How could Hollywood sink so low and nominate this monstrous combination of pure commercial thinking and perverse blood lust for twelve Academy Awards, especially Best Actor and Supporting Actor (???), Best Writing, Best Director, Best Music and  Best Picture? Or is the Best Picture nomination only a result of the number of other nominations?It really hurts seeing how the American audience ignored the terrible way history is treated in Hollywood. Ridley Scott commercialized the Ancient Rome so obviously that one might believe he meant it ironically. But the movie is deadly serious (as is Oscar-winning actor` Russell Crowe who moves his face I think three times during the whole film!), so we are really supposed to believe that Maximus the Gladiator was Christian and hoped to meet his family again in the Hereafter. The whole story is so dumb that even eight-year old children should say they are too old for such nonsense.It is no argument pro Ridley Scott that he gave a second birth to the genre of the sandal movie`. The real Roman movies were historically more accurate, more intelligent and not so overloaded with glaring computer-animated visual backgrounds.

222,mOVIemAN56,A Modern Epic,10,26 March 2005,"(Possible Spoilers)Gladiator could be considered the first great movie of the new millennium. It has story, it has history, it has romance, and it has action. But above all else, it has action. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the leader of Emperor Marcus Aurelius' (Richard Harris) legion in Germany. After a horrific battle to open the film, the Emperor is murdered by his power-hungry son, Commidus (Joaquin Phoenix) and Maximus is sentenced to die. After an amazing escape, Maximus returns home to find his family murdered and home destroyed. Next thing you know he's being sold as a slave to Proximo (Oliver Reed) a gladiator owner. The film is filled with amazing battle sequences held in the arena and a story of revenge that nearly matches Ben-Hur's (1959). Russell Crowe does an excellent job as the betrayed servant of Rome and the ability Joaquin Phoenix shows as a truly insane emperor is amazing. This film has some of the best acting I have ever seen. The film won (If memory serves me right) numerous awards and gratitude from critique's. The Colliseum is a tad to big compared to its actual size yet the director is still able to show how advance the Roman's were when it came to construction, battle tactics, and government. The look of Roman society is a bit off but it does not matter as that is not the focus of the film.Gladiator.

As it is quit known it is a fictionalize as Game of Thrones ,but unlike many historical movies that doesn't bother me much for this flick literally brought the interest for the classical world and let's face it the movie is *beeping* awesome and from the setting alone it is shown the huge work it was put into the project.The story is center to the Roman General Maximus Desimus Marinious ,who after the Emperor Commodus ascends the throne ,he is betray by him and now he has only one goal in life, to kill Commodus himself! The great think it is that though heavily fictionalized the characters ideals and way of thinking is compatible with what Romans had as base for their behavior. They performance although, which are all great don't harm the either! My only small complain is that the gladiatorial fights aren't very accurate (but are awesome) ,dispite that what saves them from criticism is the big budget which make the spectacle nothing short of wow inspiring.Now to the main subject of this review, the increase of mainstream audience for the classical era. When Gladiator came out ,the common people wasn't very kin in Classical history and often dismissed it and studios also didn't give much interest to the sword and sandal genre thinking of it a think of the past. Then this flick made 457,6 million dollars world wide and won five Oscars ,so after EVERYONE wanted a piece of the pie. This renew interest brought us HBO Rome, Spartacus: Blood and Sand, 300 and so on. Now it also borough and awful creations like Gods of Egypt, the remake of Ben-Hur and some more, but if this the price for the people to get started in learning history so be it.Over all I have a soft spot for this film and it truly make me go find out more about the people who ones lived and their actions, tragedies and greatest achievements.

Gladiator is an epic comeback in more ways than one.First, it is the story of a comeback: unfairly disgraced Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russel Crowe) is exiled by mad Emperor Commodus. Reduced to slavery, he earns his keep in the arena, and fights his way to the Colosseum in Rome, and to revenge. It is as streamlined as storytelling comes.Then, it marks the comeback of director Ridley Scott after a series of flops and artistically underwhelming pictures. It also sees the return of a genre confined to the dustbin of cinematic history since the failure of the bloated Fall of the Roman Empire over three decades prior (which incidentally also told the story of a general fighting a redeeming battle against mad emperor Commodus). How odd that a studio might pick a director best known for science fiction to tell what is on paper essentially the same story as that famous flop?Galvanized by techniques first deployed in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, Scott chose to stick to a straightforward, almost very by-the-numbers script and immerse us in the arena. And immerse us he did. From the first shot to the last, Gladiator is a lean, mean, single-minded brute of a film, punctuated with quiet moments of tender beauty. The bloody fights in the arena eclipsed anything seen since, and the Rome depicted was intoxicatingly real, far removed from the stagy creations of old.Serendipity was, as it so often is, essential to this film's success: original star Antonio Banderas - the main reason the screenplay alludes to our gladiator as ""the Spaniard"" - jumped ship, and paved the way for revelation du jour Russel Crowe, fresh from L.A. Confidential. While Banderas is a likable, charming lead, it is impossible to imagine anyone else but Crowe as Maximus: he fits the role and the story like a glove, hard as nails but also deeply wounded and at times even gentle. It earned Crowe not just an Academy Award but super-stardom. Luckily that was not enough to completely eclipse revealing turns from Djimon Hounsou and Joaquin Phoenix as the mad emperor, or first-rate work from departed veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed, the later particularly haunting as gladiator-trainer Proximo.Throughout, Scott's visual mastery speaks for itself, and his seasoned collaborators all produced some of the best work in their respective careers, from set designer Arthur Max to composers Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard, whose epic score truly did echo in eternity as the ad campaign promised.Gladiator is Hollywood at its best: old-fashioned storytelling executed in a vibrant and awe-inspiring way.",Gladiator
225,La Gremlin,Awesome!,6,14 January 2001,"My only regret about this movie is this:  I wish I'd seen it in the theater instead of waiting for it on video (I was very bad about seeing new movies this summer).  I would have enjoyed it a lot more if I'd seen the full effect.Because this is a BIG movie.  And to that end, it's excellent.  The sets and costumes are incredible, the characters are well established, and the action scenes are amazing.  My only problem with the story was that I think there must have been a better way to explain the main political conflict, as the action literally has to halt in order for the characters to explain what's going on.  Other than that, I enjoyed this movie.  Although I'm not sure if it'll be up for best picture, it at least gets my honor of the year's most quotable movie.""That vexes me.  I'm terribly vexed!""",Gladiator
226,dr_clarke_2,"Old-school ""Hollywood"" spectacle from English director Scott",7,15 June 2020,"Ridley Scott's multi-award winning 2000 film Gladiator is a sword and sandals epic in the vein of Spartacus and Ben-Hur and about as historically accurate as either of them. Like those films, this is an exercise in old-school cinema spectacle, of the sort that Hollywood used to specialise in, and although it has much to recommend it, it is a little overrated.
The story unfolds like a Shakespearean tragedy: it concerns two men who are as close as brothers, one of whom betrays the other, trying to have him killed and slaughtering his family. Just as Ben-Hur became a slave, so does the protagonist here, with former General Maximus Decimus Meridius captured and sold as a gladiator, a situation he gradually starts to see as a means to gain revenge against the corrupt Roman Emperor Commodus, who betrayed him. The plot is relentless and remorseless, gradually building to an inevitable climax that sees both men die in a Hamlet-like climax.
It's all really rather traditional, and that is when it works the best. Gladiator has spectacle in spades with Ridley Scott impressively directing the film's many fight scenes. This is evident from the opening battle, where location filming, costumes, stunts, props, special effects and hundreds of extras combine to create an impressive whole. Critics have - as critics do - picked apart the film's anachronisms, both in the costumes and the Roman buildings on display, but they don't really matter enough to detract from a mise-en-scéne intended to invoke the spirit of epics from a different era of film making. Everything here is on a grand scale: John Mathieson's cinematography contributes a great deal to the epic feel of the film, with frequent use of panoramic wide-angle shots that show off the locations and battle scenes. The gory, brutal fight scenes in the arena include many close-ups, which draw the audience queasily into the thick of the action. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard's atmospheric score works well, even if it is so derivative that Zimmer was reportedly sued for stealing riffs from Holst's ""Mars: The Bringer of War"".
Even the acting is old school: method actor Russell Crowe plays Maximus Decimus Meridius with a more muscular, film star approach than he usually brings to his work, befitting the film's pedigree even if he's very naturalistic during scenes such as when Maximus finds the corpses of his murdered family. Joachim Phoenix entertainingly chews the furniture as Commodus and just in case he wasn't villainous enough, he makes incestuous advances towards his sister. Seasoned British and Irish thespians such as Richard Harris, David Schofield, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed bring class to supporting roles, just as their countrymen did in Biblical epics during the nineteen fifties.
The problems lie with the characterisation and the dialogue: Maximus and Commodus are both fairly one-dimensional, and Connie Nielsen's sister Lucilla is little better despite Nielsen's commanding performance. Oliver Reed gives one last great performance as gladiator trainer Antonius Proximo, but he get saddles with some silly line such as ""you sold me queer giraffes"". The dialogue is often portentous and frequently pretentious and if frequently clunks; the characters are little more than extensions of the plot. Thus, Djimon Hounsou brings quiet dignity to the role of Juba, Maximus' friend and fellow Gladiator, but Juba doesn't ultimately actually do a great deal of note.
But this is perhaps churlish. If Scott was indeed intending to ape sword and sandal films he remembered seeing in his youth - as he has implied in interviews about the film - he most certainly succeeded. And the film is a technical accomplishment in its own right, with the Mill's special effects largely meshing seamlessly with the sets and location filming. The biggest special effect in the film was necessitated by the unfortunate death of Reed before he finished filming his scenes and although you can tell when he's been digitally resurrected if you are looking for it, for the most part the production gets away with it.
Gladiator does not boast the best screenplay ever written, nor does it boast the most interesting characters. But what it does do - and does well - is provide a then-modern spin on a classic Hollywood genre fondly remembered by its English director. It's impressive as a cinematic achievement but also as an example of the sort of spectacle that Cecil B. DeMille would have loved: in spite of its shortcomings, I suspect that it will be highly regarded for many years to come.",Gladiator
227,Rockwell_Cronenberg,A Shakespearean epic.,9,23 March 2012,"This movie is pure Shakespeare. I hadn't seen it in years and tonight was my first time watching it in Blu-Ray, which just elevated it to an even higher plane. All of the technical aspects of the film are wildly impressive. The costumes, the sets, the score, the cinematography in particular was an astonishing achievement. So many shots felt like they were paintings, the actors working on some master artist's canvas. Ridley Scott crafts an epic tale of the warrior Maximus, but it's interesting how intimate the sets themselves are. The battles take place within arenas and almost the entire film is in dark hallways, cells or rooms within large structures. Even the big battle scene that opens the film is on a small field, yet Scott is able to give the film such a grand scope. It speaks a lot to his skill as a director.The blending of fantasy and reality, as Maximus is constantly looking into the afterlife, reaching out to be with his slain wife and son, is seamless and beautifully touching. We are given an inside look into what Maximus fights for, and Scott's direction is so clear in delivering that to us. It's truly some of the most precise direction I've seen, working from an immaculate script by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson. The fact that this was an original script still blows my mind. If I had gone in not knowing that I honestly would have thought that it was a Shakespeare adaptation of some play I had somehow never heard of. Dipped in themes as old and violent as revenge, betrayal, incest and battles both physical and political, the film feels like it was ripped straight from the man himself. The dialogue is some of the best of recent years, poetic without seeming like it's trying too hard, memorable without ever becoming unnatural to it's characters.It's all played out by a tremendous ensemble, highlighted by the explosive force that is Russell Crowe. He turns Maximus into a stone badass, but in his eyes you can still manage to see a warm and honest soul. He's a good man who is forced into a dark place and the result is someone you would never want to have coming after you. As the man he's going after, Joaquin Phoenix is the ultimate slime, having so much fun in the depravity of the role but also managing to bring a surprising vulnerability to the part. I was very caught off guard the several times that I actually felt bad for his Commodus. The battles are wildly entertaining, appropriately violent and so immaculately choreographed, as is to be expected on a Scott production. Working in this genre is just another example of the superb diversity that both Scott and Crowe are capable of, and guiding this achievement is both men at the absolute top of their game.",Gladiator
228,TheHoodOfSwords,Great Epic Historical,8,24 May 2020,"It's been forever, and I truly mean forever since I've seen a historical epic like this. I know that some people might get bored of them and maybe it's because I haven't seen a lot but I really like them! Usually, I start with what I liked about a movie and then move onto what I didn't like but I'm going to do it the other way today. The things I didn't like about this movie were the slow-motion scenes and the heavily edited fight scenes. That's honestly it. Moving on to what I did like, one thing that immediately stood out to me was the set design and costume this felt similar to GoT to me in the sense that I really felt like I was there and that I was watching a historical piece. I loved the atmosphere the movie sets up, giant sprawling landscapes and mountains. The whole place feels dusty, lived in and blisteringly hot.Next, by god the score in this film was amazing. Triumphant in times it needed to be but also with tinges of sadness and mourning and loss when it needed to be. They use a couple of themes over again but I think this is one of the situations where it works really well. You really feel for Maximus as he goes through this journey. They make sure you understand he has some moral code but that he is still willing to fight for and kill for what he believes in.Finally, HOLY S**T THE DIALOGUE IS AMAZING. I mean it! If you removed the gladiatorial fighting scenes from this the story would still translate quite well, and it's all because the dialogue is perfect. There was a moment or two that I could feel a bit of it being from the 1990s but for the most part, it was done really well. Russel and Joaquin are both amazing protagonists and villains due to how well they're played out on screen. One is a warrior who is just trying to go back to his family, another is a son of royalty who would give it all up for a hug from his dad. If you're into giant fight scenes and a don't mind a bit of choppy slow motion and quick editing then I would absolutely recommend this to you.Also ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED is a classic line.",Gladiator
229,zeekwunlau,Tragic legend,8,23 April 2020,"The film began in the winter of 180 AD, according to the prologue of the head of the photo. At that time, the Roman Caesar-Marcus Aurelius, hereinafter referred to as the old emperor, after two decades of war, Rome reached the peak of power. To North Africa and north to southern England, the beginning of the film is the old emperor led the army to the Germania of Armenia, the Germans are retreating, the latter is already a war in the urn, and the general of the northern Roman army Maximus Maximus prepared for the army in the early morning. , Ready to give the Germans a final blow.At the beginning of the film, the first shot was given to Massimos 's hand. Even if it was watched for the first time, the audience subconsciously could reflect that it was the protagonist 's hand. The person in the shot was walking forward while stroking the wheat ears in the field. Wheat is the most important crop in the Latin region of the Mediterranean. That person must be on the farm. With light and sad humming, people subconsciously reflect this story as a tragedy. Next, I immediately switched to Massimos dressed in a uniform, with a snow-covered back and a cold wind, and the fur cape on my shoulders couldn't help but flutter. It was a flat shot. Generally speaking, the shots we give to heroes are usually Looking up, the shot for the villain is usually looking down, but this plain flat shot makes people understand the director's style: I am just a narrative person. And the war is imminent, why is this person absent-minded and his eyes flickering? Next came a bird flying away. The person stared at the bird and showed a pleasant smile, as if envious of the bird. The above are all foreshadowings. When I watched the audience, I suddenly realized that the director had explained the most warlike general in Rome from the beginning. He didn't like to fight. He just wanted to go home to farm. He was a very simple soul.The troops are ready to attack, everything has been arranged properly, and only the soldiers who persuaded the surrender to bring back a message. As always, Massimos observed his troops in the trenches, on the one hand, to observe the status and morale of the soldiers, and on the other hand, to tell the soldiers that he was by their side. When the soldiers saw Massimos coming, they all stood up, and they all showed relief smiles and respectful eyes. From here, they knew that this general was extremely prestigious in the army, and won the respect and trust of the soldiers. In the soul. Even though he was so tired, seeing Massimos came, he still had to stand up and put on a ready look before the general, so as not to disappoint the general. After reviewing all the way, Massimos came to the deputy and told the deputy that the troops were tired and hungry and no longer wanted to fight. The implication was that if this were the last battle, the troops might not be able to sustain it. It took too long. Here again shows that Massimos has a very rich experience. After a few observations, the status of the troops can be known. Then the adjutant said that the range of the catapult and the front sight were not set in place, and it might hurt the cavalry around by mistake. Massimos said that this error was acceptable. Next, we saw why he personally led the cavalry around. To put it this way, he not only has rich commanding experience, but also has a lot of experience in battlefield charging. He knows how not to be hit by his own catapult during the charge, which is within his control.The persuasion soldiers had their heads cut, and the Germans came out of the woods to call for battle. Massimos immediately realized that the persuasion failed and immediately prepared to charge the cavalry. First, it was a routine, to encourage morale. Don't disperse the formation, don't be afraid of death, you are doing glorious things, and the tone of the soldiers makes the soldiers laugh, which also confirms that he finally said, ""They said that the god of death smiled at everyone, all you have to do is laugh back."" Then from the rear The Germans were plagiarized, the battle continued for a day, and the Germans were wiped out. In fact, from the comparison of the lineup of the two armed forces at the beginning, we can see that there is no suspense in this battle. The old emperor sat in the rear army all the way, and after the battle came to see Massimos, ""What should I reward the greatest general in Rome?"" ""Let me go home."" Massimos confided his voice, which was also his The goal I hope to achieve throughout the article has never been achieved. The old emperor did not immediately answer him. Such a good general, the emperor must have a heavy trust. How could it be possible for you to go home? Massimos gave his reason: ""This battle is over and no battle is over."" It means that I am a soldier, and I should have gone home if I did not fight. The emperor also gave him the reason: ""There are always battles"", which means that he has more and more important things to entrust to Massimos. Over the years, the two have had a tacit understanding, Massimos understand At this point, I do n't know what the real intention of the emperor Lao Er is.Space is limited. Forgive me, I will only talk about Massimos, not to talk about the prince Commodus, the empress Lucia, and the emperor Lucius. After returning to the barracks, Massimos first thing was to go to the tent to see the wounded soldiers, and chatted with the military doctor. Here we can see that he cares about the loss of troops and horses before and after the war. He is not like the elders. A politician is not like the royal dignitaries. He knows the essence of the war, and he knows every trouble in the middle. Back at the celebration feast, the prince Commodus invited him to serve for himself, and wanted to win him over. Massimos did not give a clear answer; the senator told him: ""You hold a heavy soldier, you will have considerable political power to speak."" Meaning The army listens to you alone, don't you have any ambitions? Want to ""share great things with him"". However, Massimos did not reply directly because of the occasion. If he was on the battlefield, he estimated that he would have killed these chewing people. From here we can see that on the one hand, Massimos is in control of the overall situation on the battlefield and is invincible, but politically he knows nothing at all and does not want to participate in these things. In his logic, the soldier is a soldier, It's okay to fight the battle well. There are so many broken things.Early the next morning, Massimo groaned with his brothers at the camp, but he could not have breakfast with his brothers today. The emperor summoned him this morning and asked him to go to the emperor to camp. From this, it can be seen that his military career was spent with his own grass-roots soldiers, which explains why the soldiers have such a good relationship with him, so listen to him. After seeing the emperor, the emperor was still writing his own diary (Marco Ole remained in his own twenty-year Rongma career and has been writing a diary, sometimes as a memo, sometimes as a dialogue, this diary is right Later generations have a profound influence, whether it is important for future generations' life, or historical archaeology.) The old emperor pretended to be mysterious and asked him why we came here. Massimos did not understand the meaning of the old man. In this regard Massimos will not work anymore. The old emperor's political attainments are also estimated to be extraordinary. He has a clear level of speech and sets up many institutions. Fortunately, the old emperor liked Massimos. If he wanted Massimos to die, Massimos probably died without reacting. Massimos replied: We are here to conquer the land and glorify Rome. This is a very orthodox subordinate answering the tone of the superior. The old emperor obviously did not let him report to work, so he set aside the first layer of cloud and began to suggest to the topic, roughly meaning: ""I am old, Massimos, In the twenty-four years of my reign, I only brought four years of peace to the people, and the remaining twenty years of war. What will people think of me in future generations? Does my life make sense? ""Massimos probably does not hear the emperor for the first time. Tucao was born, and he knew that what the emperor wanted to say was coming, so he planned to follow the emperor's words. The emperor interrupted him and went to bed, meaning that we let go of our fears and opened the skylight to speak brightly, but not ourselves. Say, let Massimos first say that political literacy is evident. Massimos goes straight, you let me say, I said, ""I brought five thousand people, but two thousand could not go back, the rest Thousands of them died after a half, and they fought for Rome. ""He narrated his beliefs, as well as the beliefs of the troops. He thought all this was meaningful and did not want the emperor to doubt himself. The emperor gave a new question: ""What is Rome?"" Massimos further said: ""I have been to many other places, dark and savage, Rome is like light."" From here, Massimo Si is truly loyal to Rome and truly recognizes his motherland. This is the old man testing his inner loyalty to the motherland.Then the old emperor began to enter the real purpose, let Massimos talk about things in his home, this is not a dialogue between the king and the minister, but a dialogue between men. As soon as Massimo talked about this, he smiled, and his eyes were shining. This seemed to be the topic he was most interested in. Here, seeing that the thing he cares most about is his wife and son, he was absent-minded before the beginning of the war and was thinking: ""This It's the last battle, I don't want to overturn the boat in the gutter, I haven't gone back in a year, I don't know if my son will ride a horse, I don't know my wife ... ""And the emperor Obviously he heard the answer he expected. After testing wheth",Gladiator

231,smakawhat,Russel WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN THIS MESS!!,4,23 May 2000,"So this is how I start my summer movie bonanza.  Looking forward to Russel and a good story and some big budget action to produce serious eye candy.How disapointed I was soon to be.  Gladiator is an unfortunate rehash of the same ole good guy revenges against evil and of course it's ALWAYS the evil one's love interest that is in love with the good guy.  This movie falls into that same ole trap, and none of the actors and actresses have anything to work with.  Everyone seems fine, Crowe who is normaly dynamic and plays interesting characters is uninteresting cause his character is the same banal hero in every BAD revenge movie out there. Joaquin Phoenix as Commudus is ok he seems like the only person in the film who looks like a Roman but he's BORING.  It's not that they are bad, it's that their characters are so stereotypical and bleak that there's nothing interesting about them.  And then of course it plays into that HOPELESS cliche when the weak evil guy we all know how pathetic he is, will try to defeat the hero in  a battle we know he will loose.  WHY??? cause he's a looser.  Gee couldn't figure that out..So then I would think at LEAST there'd be some good action in this picture.. Wrong again..  Sure some of the battle scenes are neat, but I found them boring and they were hampered by the BIGGEST complaint I have with this picture.  This film was SOOOOOOOOO darkly shot that I could barely even make out the characters faces.  There is nothing wrong with this effect but it was used so poorly here that the fight scenes were chaotic and blurry (I found my eyes jumping all over the first battle scene), to the simple dialogue scenes where I could barely see even the characters eyeballs. 
Historical inacuracies??  Probably several, do I care?  No.  I went to this film for the entertainment value and it didn't even give me that!

233,Eternality,"A potent motion picture depicting loyalty, corruption, and slavery in the most brutal, uncompromising fashion.",9,16 August 2010,"The release of Gladiator helped significantly in consolidating Ridley Scott's reputation as a master filmmaker. His best two works are still Alien, and Blade Runner made in the early 1980s. But Gladiator has been a cause of optimism for Scott, a box-office success, as well as being nominated for twelve Oscars, bagging five, including best picture. It's a confidence booster for the premier director whose works in the 1990s have been mediocre by his own towering standards.A visual spectacle, Gladiator combines elements from Spartacus, and Ben-Hur, and is made in the tradition of classic epics, but enhanced with modern special effects technology. The result is a potent motion picture depicting loyalty, corruption, and slavery in the most brutal, uncompromising fashion, set in medieval Rome. The level of cinematography accomplished is of the highest standard, capturing Rome in astonishing detail, yet with a certain degree of credibility. The film is 2.5 hours long, but Scott keeps it tightly paced, without going overboard with fancy editing.Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix provide the two supporting pillars, carrying the bulk of the film on their shoulders, giving a powerhouse, and devilish display respectively. Gladiator would only be half as engaging without Hans Zimmer rousing, grandeur score. It's a perfect complement to the visuals. Gladiator comes at a crucial time when the epic genre seems almost non-existent since Mel Gibson's Braveheart.

After the risible and derivative `Hannibal' Ridley Scott swiftly redeems himself with his stylish and impeccable direction in `Gladiator'. I've never been a big fan of his work (I think `Blade Runner' and `Alien' are among the most overrated movies of all time) but this proves to me that he is a good director. The cinematography is sheer brilliance and the recreation of the Colosseum is magnificent. The rest of the settings are indeed superb and the play of dark shade on Rome adds to the atmosphere. The score by Hans Zimmer is equally impressive and accurately timed. The acting standard is also very good and there are great performances all round. Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar he received. Jaoquin Phoenix is dark and moody, as the evil Emperor Commodus (seems a bit like a take-off of Nero). Connie Nielson gives a much needed, international break-through role.
The good thing is that `Gladiator' balances out drama with gruesome battles. There is enough blood here to please all `bloodsporting actioners' yet plenty of drama to enlighten the `cinematic elite'.

236,jose-cruz53,One of the best historical epics,10,2 January 2013,"While more ""serious"" film buffs and film critics don't like Gladiator very much, I, as an history buff, have special interest in ancient Roman history. It is perfectly true that Rome didn't became a republic in 182 AD, and this film can be understood more as an exercise of alternate history. Though is suffers from anachronisms, in terms of dialogue and history: Marcus Aurelius says that he expanded the empire, while in truth he didn't expand it, he only maintained the borders against the pressure from migrating Germanic tribes.Another problem is the fact that Rome never had grain reserves maintained by the State, or at least didn't have according to the historical evidence, and a line o dialogue says: ""he is selling our future"" when the emperor sells the grain reserves, such anachronisms plague the film and are an important flaw but I don't think that they merit the removal of a full point of the film's score. The dialogue and the characters are not the most complex ever but are executed well enough and this is enough. Excessive complexity and pretension can kill a film.Overall, I highly recommend this film to those people that love films but don't have any great pretension. More more artsy types shouldn't see it.

237,the amorphousmachine,We need more Roman Epics these days!!,8,31 August 2000,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is an excellent portrayal of a hero, and a very good film. The opening sequence was just fantastic and the battle/fight scenes were cleverly choreographed.This is a story about good versus evil but it is told so well. Russell is excellent as the hero, General Maximus Decimus Berilus, and Joaquin Pheonix plays the villain, Commodus, exceedly well. His character wasn't over-the-top evil, he had emotion, and his hate seemed to stem from his resentment of his father and Maximus. Don't get me wrong, Commodus was evil but there was a great contrast of his wanting to be loved and accepted, and his suspicion of the people surrounding him. This made for excellent story-telling and added depth to Commodus!It was great to see Richard Harris in Gladiator as Marcus Aurelius. Actually the whole cast was brilliant but it was truly Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott's film! Russell Crowe manages to portray Maximus' stern loyalty and strong sense of justice with ease. We admire Maximus and loathe Commodus- both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix become the characters. This is an great film and well worth seeing! All I can say is, they should have more Roman Epics. And this film has got enough action and drama to entertain, and with performances and direction to match!

I have always wondered why don't they make movies about gladiators like they used to. Oh, well when I hear that ""Gladiator"" was coming up last summer, I thought.  That is going to be a hit.  I believe that when I read  that Ridley Scott (Thelma & Louise, G.I. Jane) was directing it I knew the movie had to be good. I knew nothing about Russell Crowe ""Maximus Decimus Meridius,"" Who is the Gladiator himself, perhaps because his name was not all over the place as it is now, I have movies that I am watching and I go? : Russell Crowe! The movie at hand is romantic, full of good principles and ""biceps"" combined with great fights. I enjoyed the movie very much. I am trying to leave people's private lives outside their work. I thought that Russell deserved the Golden globe nomination that he has received and wish him the best in his career and private life as well.

239,mhasheider,A respectable and fairly engaging Roman epic.,8,8 October 2001,"A respectable and fairly Roman epic about a much beloved Roman general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), who instead becoming the next emperor of Rome is forced to be in the gladiator fights, which were fierce and...a bit on the bloody side.  The strongest parts of this Ridley Scott film are the excellent fight scenes and the performances of veteran actors Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, and Oliver Reed (who died during the filming).  Only the appearence and design of Rome look very grainy and unpleasant.  I have some doubt why this movie received some Oscars that included Best Actor (Crowe, no offense) and Best Picture.  The only nominations that this film should deserve are Best Supporting Actor for Reed and Djimon Hounsou instead of Joaquin Phoenix (brother of the late River Phoenix).",Gladiator

He thought the movie was murky looking, had bad special effects, mediocre acting from Russell Crowe, and he brought down his rating for historical inaccuracies. (Says the guy who praised Brave heart and The Last Temptation of Christ-both of which are great movies.""Was he not entertained?"") His co-host at the time disagreed and called it one of the best movies she had ever seen.So do I, but not very highly.(It's on my favorite movie list but near the end.) I am not bothered by historical inaccuracies, only major biblical ones.(Speaking of which, this masterpiece is from the director of Exodus Gods and Kings.) The action makes this fun and that's all that counts.If you enjoy Ben-Hur, which won Best Picture 41 years prior,you may like this too, because this has a similar plot. Both are about a person enslaved by a friend, and that person wanting revenge. While Crowe's character does not meet Jesus and does return for vengeance-unlike Ben-Hur, the movies share similar plot structures.Gladiator is fun, action packed, and thrilling. While I prefer Traffic, I do think was worthy of winning Best Picture. It's well worth seeing.",Gladiator

I thought the plot was good and kept me intrigued during the long running time. I thought the action scenes were great and it was interesting to watch action without the use of guns or explosions. I like watching watching these types of movies that are based about the past and show you how people used to live. One slight negative about the movie is that it's not entirely historically accurate which is a bit disappointing as some of the characters really did exist, but it doesn't take away the fact that it is a good movie.",Gladiator
244,jaibo,A great big disappointment,5,11 June 2000,"I found this film extremely disappointing. Maybe it is wrong to make comparisons but if put besides Ben Hur or Sparticus, this had a distinct lack of narrative power, interesting characters, heart or intellectual meaning. I personally did not care about Maximus  a man with the minimus of personality  or indeed about any of the barely sketched figures which people the film. I also found Ridley Scott's visual style contemptuous. He does not seem the least bit concerned about making images with meaning or power but merely illustrates the script with pretty, overly crowded pictures. Most of it looked like an expensive advert. I kept expecting the actors to climb into a bath and eat a flake, or a new model of car to drive by, or the gladiators to run round the stadium in adidas trainers! With the exception of Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed, the actors (especially the wildly overrated Joachim Pheonix) were not up to the job, the script lurched from one meaningless event to another and the human interest was zero. I simply cannot understand why people have fallen for this drivel.",Gladiator
245,jeremy3,"I thought this would be just a blood fest, but I was wrong.",10,2 December 2007,"For the last seven years, I heard many people rave about Gladiator. I put off viewing the movie, because I thought it would be just another gore fest. I was wrong. This movie has a great plot and great heart to it. It doesn't sugar coat life in ancient Rome. Rome an assume civilization, but it also was one of great brutality. Life was very hard. Russell Crowe was excellent as a hero who was pure of heart. He could fight and defeat the best of them, but he never did it out of sadism. His character, a Roman general, was a bit naive actually, and believed in ""good intentions"". Unfortunately, he is up against the amoral son of the Roman Emperor (Richard Harris), who is all into macho-ism, but never has really been on a battle field or in the gladiator ring. That makes the son (Joaquim Phoenix) filled with spite, fear, resentment, jealously and hate for all that the Gladiator-General (Crowe) represents. The hero is all about bravery and valor, but not out about playing politician and hurting people out of spite like the Emperor's son was. I really liked this movie a lot. It was very well acted, very well filmed, very realistic, and also portrayed how hard and brutal life was in the Roman Empire. It was also Oliver Reed's last role. He plays an Arab or African owner-leader of the ""Gladiators"". He can be brutal and ruthless, but develops a heart when he sees that the hero is really standing up for the ""common man"", and not just a ""coward"".",Gladiator

All of the other ones were really cool especially the slaves against the warriors.  That was cool and that arrow lady gets it good.  Really good.  The one with Joaquin Pheonix and Russell Crowe was very good.  The acting between everybody was good and Russell Crowe deserved that Academy Award.  I think Joaquin Phoenix should have gotten it, too.  He was really good as the villain.  Overall the entire movie was great and I recommend this to everybody.

250,fimimix,..the whole movie was wonderful..,10,19 October 2006,"I absolutely agree with every favorable comment written here. I can find no fault with David Frazoni's story nor Ridley Scott's direction. The cinematography was amazing and colorful; I did not find the CGIs to be intrusive. That the entire production involved so many thousands of people is a testament to filmmakers' ability to produce beautiful, thoroughly enjoyable movies, eve today. ""The Gladiator"" serves them all up in a gorgeous heap.Mention ""gladiator"" and ""Rome"" and a whole plot comes to mind, but this one certainly combines the necessity of bloodshed, gentility and nobility with action in one grand epic. It is sufficiently historically accurate, but it really IS the story which is the ""star"" in this film. Although all of them gave magnificent performances, it isn't necessary to list all of the cast here. I've read eleven pages of the huge total; I'm sure other readers will read some of them, too. It is, however, irreverent not to praise ""bad-boy"" Russell Crowe doing his act here so eloquently, with principled reverence. Truly, Bravo! Mr. Crowe. AND - an early exposure to Djimon Hounsu in a good role.With the polyglot that Rome was, one should not be surprised to find a contradiction to ""chris_j_albanese"", who says (I think) there was no homosexuality in ""The Gladiator"". ""Chris"" must have missed the scene when Roman guards come to the senator's home to drag him off to jail, with the senator shoo-ing his ""painted"" companion away.....When I tried to re-wind my VHS-cassette - a home-made gift from a friend - it wouldn't. Therefore, I'll be buying the wonderful DVD in the near future, so that I can continue to put-in a lot of time watching this movie, just as I've been doing for about four years. I consider it to be the best of this genre. It must sound rather like a broken record, but I thank every technician who did anything to bring this gem to the screen. It's good for every emotion - an easy 30....",Gladiator
251,illbebackreviews,"A beautiful, intense and dramatic film",7,3 January 2013,"Gladiator is one of those masterpieces of the past decade. This film contains everything that a film needs. It creates emotion, suspense, drama and most importantly a brilliant story that is mixed with real events and great characters. What Ridley Scott did so well, in what is probably his finest film, is that unlike many directors who may get carried away by the action, Scott remains in complete control of the story the whole way. There is not a second of pointless action that is put into the film. In fact, altogether, this film had very little action and a lot of substance into the story. Even though the theme ""Revenge"" has been done to death in films such as Kill Bill, Man on Fire and all the other films, no film truly captures its meaning like Gladiator does.The acting in this film is just brilliant. Russel Crowe does a splendid job with his character Maximum, whom during the film we really see as a real person and his tragedy. It was interesting to see the final fate of Maximum from a brave general into a slave and then into a gladiator who still remains a leader until his death. The other character I really enjoyed was Juba, and the friendship between the two was so beautifully done that I, after watching the Extended Edition, wished there was more of that. Something that really masterminds the film is Hans Zimmer's breathtaking musical score which just further perfects every scene. Even the character Commodus, is someone that I felt pity for, but at the same time found just filled with evil desire. He was brilliantly portrayed in the film and the final stand off between the two was just well put together. ***SPOILERS***When Commodus stabs Maximum just before their duel, you really see how pathetic of a person Commodus has become and his death was brilliantly portrayed. Even though I've cried when some characters die in movies, I really didn't cry when Maximum fell down and died because I knew that Ridley Scott only knew too well that Maximum's death meant that he could live a happier life with his family in the afterlife.I also liked Richard Harris' character of the Emperor. Seeing him getting killed by his only son was just depressing but also made only more sense. When Marcus Aurelius said to Maximus that he wished he had become Marcus' son, that continues to remind we of when Denethor from Lord of the Rings said that he wished Boromir had lived and Faramir had died. This film, much like Lord of the Rings, beautifully captures my interest in the film even without the fight scenes. Everything about this film was brilliant and so I loved it!",Gladiator
252,basrutten,"Finally, a movie that takes its time to tell a story",8,7 March 2002,"After seeing wave after wave of mindless action movies, I was actually quite surprised to for once see a movie that took its time (almost three hours) to tell an epic tale of courage, love, etc.That story is far from perfect: the movie can be horribly slow, there are plot holes, and the entire thing borders on the sentimental, but as a whole the story is quite impressive.The action scenes in this movie, which are not as frequent as you might expect, are quite well-done for the most part, although they are edited in a very haphazard way, making the battles very hard to follow.
Gladiator is by no means a classic, but it's a welcome change from the explosion-per-minute, mindless Jerry Bruckheimer and Ronald Emmerich (to name a few) crap, and it's a movie that has a really epic feeling to it. It make me feel great for at least a week after first seeing it.

253,shadowman123,Ridley Scott puts epic back on the map,8,14 April 2008,"When I was at High School everyone was going on about Gladiator and how good it was. Having seen several old movies like Spartus, I knew that these movies would require you to get into the mood for them to really enjoy them. And it seemed that all these years later and several failed attempts later I finally got around to viewing it. All I can say is that it truly was worth the hype when it came out and after all this time it still has not lost its shine as it still has the ability to entertain us. Ridley Scott set out to give us an epic and thats exactly what he had managed to do. I can't think of anybody else who could of done a job to the quality of Russell Crowe although if you pay close attention you can hear his Australian accent a bit. Joaquin Phoneix him-self was marvellous along with Oliver Reed, along with Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris , they were nothing short of mind blowing. The script was sharp and tight not to mention the costumes, make-up and various other things that made the whole experiences breath taking. The music alone is worth a purchase and it adds a certain haunt to the point where one really does want to cry. To conclude Gladiator for me is a bit like a Porshce Carrera GT , if you put the effort into watching this then I promise it is a form of pure escapism rather than entertainment.

255,Shiva-11,A entertaining movie that will be displaced in weeks.,8,15 May 2000,"Gladiator:  Having defeated the last pocket of resistance to the Roman Empire General Maximus is determined to return to his life as a farmer. Marcus Aurelius Caesar has other plans;  he wants Maximus to succeed him as ruler so that Rome can once again become a republic and be returned to the people.  Unfortunately, Aurelius' son Commodus learns of this and sentences Maximus to death. But, the best laid plansThis movie seems to have triggered a round of ""Blockbusteritis""- after a spate of mediocre films, it is the first big budget movie of the summer and it is indeed entertaining.  But the 62nd best movie of all time (as voted by 3500 members on the Internet Movie Database)?  I think not. 
The first battle scene is without a doubt my favorite part of the film - an amazing spectacle enhanced by excellent cinematography and painstakingly choreographed, it combines the best elements of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Braveheart"".  I was in addition duly impressed by the special effects, particularly the recreation of the Coliseum, and the battles between the gladiators (it may be a bit too intense for some people, after all it's not often that you get to see a literal bloodbath).  I did however have several problems with the story. Maximus rides from Germania to Spain, a journey that would surely take weeks if not months and arrives literally moments too late to save his family - a little too convenient for my liking.  Also, after all that time his wound is still bleeding - surely he would have become food for the buzzards long before that.  Or why did Commodus not have Maximus assassinated when he returns to Rome?  But my biggest question was the past between Maximus and Lucilla: without a doubt, the most pivotal relationship in the movie and it is never explained.  The acting is similarly unbalanced.Once again Russel Crowe proves his versatility as an actor: his Maximus is quiet spoken, stoic, straightforward and lives by a code of honor (a concept too few people are familiar with these days).  It is impossible not to feel for him.  Richard Harris, though onscreen only briefly, is excellent as the omnipotent ruler who knows his time is ending (I hope it was the makeup that made him look that bad) and is determined to do the right thing.  I'm still ambivalent over Joaquin Phoenix's take on Commodus, the villain of the piece - I did not hate him for being evil, but for annoying me.  I couldn't wait for someone to cleave him in two to put an end to the whining, sniveling, incestuous little weasel.Although Gladiator does not have the staying power of Spartacus or Ben Hur, it is a good way to wile away an afternoon.",Gladiator

I wanted the story to be more believable and I wanted to care more for the characters. This is not to say that this effort is not worth seeing. Richard Harris and Russell Crow give excellent performances. The overall look of the period was captured well however the battle scenes, while intense, were so chopped up, one would think the editor, Pietro DiGiamimo had drank too much coffee. The quick camera work along with chopped editing actually made me dizzy. A mixed bag for me but this film should  appeal to those who like epic, action thrillers.

258,harrylosborne,Ridley Scott's defining masterpiece,10,31 March 2019,"Gladiator is the prime example of filmmaking at its best: massive set pieces, honest acting, and a plot to back up the gravity of the scenes. Moving from the forests of Germany and the fighting pits of Zucchabar, before culminating in the Colosseum of Rome, Scott's historical epic flows seamlessly. Russell Crowe gives an Oscar-worthy performance as the grizzled but vengeful Maximus, plotting a course back to the Emperor Commodus (equally brilliantly played by Joaquin Phoenix). The fighting pits emulate the unrest within the capital, as discord grows between the emperor and the Senate.Fighting scenes are appropriately epic: realistic imagery and brutal military style are on full show, accentuated by the devotion paid to the costume design of the film. Hans Zimmer is, as usual, perfect in scoring the film, adding both a solemness to darker scenes, whilst capturing the heat of battle when required. The fine acting is merely the icing on the cake. Not a wrong step is taken, from the leads down to the more minor roles (a personal favourite is Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' gladiatorial ally Juba).Gladiator comes together perfectly in all facets of film - there is a perfectly good reason this is such a highly acclaimed film, and for all the right reasons.

259,Mitch-38,"GIVE THEM ""BREAD AND CIRCUS""",7,25 July 2000,"Rome, just like any other empire (British, Soviet and American, etc.), was bent as seeing itself as enlightening a dark world, even if attained by savage conquering. Therefore, historically speaking, it's hard to see these folks as the proverbial ""good guys"" in some kind of morality play.
That said, director Ridley Scott does deliver to us a pretty good movie. I found the performances adequate, yet still couldn't help see Russell Crowe's character (Maximus) as the L.A. CONFIDENTIAL detective character suited up in armor. The same brooding performance. Maximus, for a Roman General, is the typical Hollywood antihero. (Hey...let's mow these Huns down, so I can call it a day, and get home to the wife and kid.) This is hardly original. I've seen better work of his, in such films as the mentioned L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, THE SUM OF US and ROMPER STOMPER. His main antogonist, is the emperor's son, Commodus, played bewilderingly off-the-box by Joaquin Phoenix. The guy is a walking-talking Freudian slip, whom anyone with an ounce of sense wouldn't let him watch a hardware store for an afternoon, let alone an empire. The contrasts between the two leading characters was simply too obvious and simplistic. I frankly saw too much of a parallel in the script, with the relationship of Marcus Aurelius, Maximus, Commodus and Lucilla. It was like this part was lifted from THE TEN COMMANDMENTS. It reminded me of the old Red Skelton quip: ""Impersonation isn't the sincerest form of flattery...it's plagiarism!"" Well, not as bad as all that, but the screenplay was hardly original, as well.   A nice touch, was adding a few older veteran actors (namely Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed, who gives an excellent turn to his character ""PROXIMO""). The battle scenes and the brutal gladiator fights were stunning in their horrible brutality. Serious kudos for not flinching about the awful truths of human carnage. Top marks in this catagory. The computer generated effects have been well mentioned for their disapointing results, by other reviews, so I need not mention them here. Overall, rather overrated, but still generally entertaining fare if you're not looking for something too deep. A classic on the level of SPARTACUS? Hardly.",Gladiator

I have seen the movie ""Braveheart"" and I find that this movie tends to copy too much of ""Braveheart"" and this is the only thing I dissaproved of in the movie.  The Gladiator tries to act like Mel Gibson, look like Mel and talk like Mel (probably because they are from the same birthplace).  But if you must have an actor that portrays too much of another actor, you might as well have that actor that is being portrayed in the movie instead of somebody else.  The plot and theme of ""Gladiator"" is also like ""Braveheart"".  let's face it, if you've seen ""Braveheart"" because that one came out before ""Gladiator"" then you know what ""Gladiator"" is all about.

Hans Zimmer also provides what is in my opinion one of his best ever scores, which just make the fight scenes even more entertaining. Joaquin Phoenix also gives what is probably his best performance ever, and definitely deserved an Oscar for it. Russell Crowe, although great in the movie, seems to have play his character on one note, making it a mystery how he got one and Joaquin didn't. Another issue is that although it's entertaining, all the enjoyment is on the surface, so it's not the sort of movie you'll be thinking about a lot afterwards. Still a great classic.",Gladiator

At this time he was tired of killing, his thick bushes had added a little silver hair, his hands that had gripped the handle of the sword had become numb, his prestige had made the sword's majesty gradually weakened, and at this moment, he just wanted to go home.

263,Aidan McGuinness,Highly enjoyable hokum,7,7 February 2002,"""Gladiator"" is hokum. Let's begin there. It's highly cheesy - but it's quality cheese. It's nice cheese. I like to eat this cheese.The premise is absurdly simple - Maximus Meridus (Russell Crowe) loses his family and his command after refusing to pledge alliegance to the psychotic new Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix) because Commodus is a loony and killed his own father to gain power, fearing (rightly) his dad was about to dissolve the role of Emperor. So he ends up being a gladiator and uses his skills to rise up and get a chance to wreak vengeance. So no points for plot and there a few historical inaccuracies but hey, it's Hollywood! We expect it..It's the acting and conviction placed into the characters that helps move this movie upwards. Crowe is great - and hey he won an Oscar for his role here. Real sense of the gritty determination he has and check out his ""And I will have my vengeance - in this life or the next"" speech- fantastic fun. Joaquin Pheonix camps it up a little as Commodus and is devilishly enjoyable as the slimy, lecherous, cowardly ruler. Fun fun fun. All the other plays similarly play well here.Ridley Scott puts enough energy into this movie to draw you in. Sure you can argue the battles are done with flashy fast moving camera work in a bid to distract you - there's some truth to that. So what? It looks nice. ""Gladiator"" doesn't have pretensions on being a highly morale and deep tale - it's a fun blockbuster! It's slick and well done. Maybe you can detract points for Zimmer's overly present musical score or the overly heavy imagery of wheat-fields etc. but in the end it doesn't matter. ""Gladiator"" doesn't have enough to make it one of my favourite movies but it does have more than enough to lift it above the general dross. A well deserved 7.8/10",Gladiator

Aside from beating LOTR on the visual and action scales (well, in my opinion), this film really recaptures the Roman era well, and is far more than just standard sword-and-sandal fare - it has a complex story, a complex script, complex characters and complex situations. The character of Commodus was done best - his spite, cunning and villainy was brought to the screen well by actor Joaquin Phoenix. Russell Crowe's Maximus was also a well-played and strong character, and one that you really felt for and understood - his humanity, love and sacrifice made him a true cinema hero.

Let me give you an idea what watching this film's action sequences is like:It's as though                               I wr                               ote the ent ire                                           review som ethi ng lik             e                   this.Now, wasn't that fun? Russell Crowe plays General Maximus, who's the leader of the armies of the Roman Empire. He's just finished beating the crap out of the barbarian hordes when Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) decides he's going to make Maximus the new emperor, spurning his cleft-lip son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). This p***es Commodus off so he kills dear old dad, kills Maximus's family, and tries to kill Maximus, who barely escapes. Maximus ends up a slave, but he starts fighting, eventually becomes the best gladiator in the land and travels back to Rome so he can have his revenge on Commodus.Aside from the action sequences, which made me feel like someone was jackhammering my head, the major problem with the film lies with Commodus, who, if he had any brains at all, would have had Maximus killed the second he saw him. Just take him in the back and bash in his head, then insist he slipped in the tub. Instead, Maximus is able to plot with Commodus's sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), and one of the senators (Derek Jacobi). Of course, Commodus is clueless the entire time. Basically, by the time the film is over, you wonder how the Roman Empire managed to conquer anything.",Gladiator
267,Indy-52,who cares about historical inaccuracy?,9,4 June 2001,"GLADIATOR is a fantastic achievement in modern filmmaking. I never expected to ever see another Roman epic, but Ridley Scott has proved it is possible. What's so great about this movie is that it has a really entertaining and enthralling storyline, not just special effects and action (although it has a lot of that): it knows how to make us care about the people in it and how to develop a sense of style and elegance (thanks to director Ridley Scott). The movie is fueled by a number of powerhouse performances: Russell Crowe is perfect as the title character, I loved Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Joaquin Phoenix made a perfectly hissable villain. I was amazed at how exciting this movie was. Although the opening battle sequence is not very promising, with its confusing, chaotic editing, after that it's just uphill: the film will send you on roller-coaster ride of nonstop thrills. The effects are very well done: there is a scene where we see Commodus arrive at Rome as the new emperor that's absolutely breathtaking. I also loved the way they recreated the Colosseum. Parts of this movie are truly awe-ispiring. The fights in the arenas are spectacularly sensational. I must also mention John Mathieson's absolutely beautiful cinematography and Hans Zimmer's perfect music score. Some scenes where Mathieson's visuals and Zimmer's music mix are undescribably beautiful and breathtaking. The entire film is beautiful: just about any frame of it would make a really good poster to stick on the wall. I recommend this film to those who appreciate to finest things in life.",Gladiator

Just click to see the latest user comments and 90% of them will be negative, trust me. So why, then, did this movie get a rating 8.1 on the database and a solid position in the top 250? Personally I think it's a very good movie, it keeps you riveted to your seat from start to finish. Great performances, great action, wonderful music and production design. It was easily the most memorable movie to come out of 2000. CROUCHING TIGER, you say? Boring hokum. TRAFFIC? Well intentioned, but highly unpleasant and tedious. ALMOST FAMOUS? Unwhimsical, repetitious gobbledygook. CAST AWAY? Pretty funny on the island, extremely crappy everywhere else. GLADIATOR was the film to see, and it more than deserved the Oscars it got. I swear I turned off the Oscars when I saw that TRAFFIC WON for best director. All the guy did was shake his camera around and stage dialogue scenes. Ridley Scott is one great director and GLADIATOR is easily his best film ever. People who don't like it should ask themselves if they like movies at all, since GLADIATOR is so obviously what they are all about.",Gladiator
269,Indy-52,"boring, cliched, unoriginal, flawed. A disappointment! *could contain spoilers*",9,4 June 2000,"i expected much better from this movie. This movie has seriously been overrated by everyone. Sure, it ain't bad, but it's not much better than movies like Mask of Zorro, Star Wars etc. But the critics raised this movie to incredible heights, saying it was a masterpiece. Well, this movie's no masterpiece at all. What makes it disappointing are its simple characters and simple story. We've seen this kind of plot a hundred times before. Strangely, this movie kind of reminded me of the Zorro movie, which i think is a better movie. That movie also had a fight at the end between the hero and the bad guy, and somehow i liked that scene better. Although we knew who was going to win, it was much more exciting than this one. Here it's just way too short and also implausible, 'cause Maximus was dying before the fight began. But getting back to the movie, i found the plot too simple and predictable to really be able to like it. The audience of my theatre wasn't really impressed, either: they all got up from their seats as soon as ""Directed by Ridley Scott"" appeared! But no matter what i say, everyone's going to see this movie. Advice: don't raise your expectations too high.",Gladiator
270,brianberta,"Great action and a great technical aspect, but I did not care for any of the characters",4,7 July 2016,"Gladiator was one of the films I grew up with as a kid. However, as I grew older, I stopped watching it, and I've gone several years without watching it. I wanted to check it out to see if I would still like it as much as I did when I was younger. When I finally re-watched it after all these years, I felt like it didn't hold up. Its fighting and technical aspects were very good, but I could not care about Maximus's character.After a Roman general named Maximus is about to become Emperor of Rome, he is betrayed by his brother named Commodus who murders his family. He is forced into slavery where he comes back as a Gladiator and fights his way up to seek his revenge.The action is definitely the highlight of this film. I think that it's really good. The fights aren't choreographed all too well since they have shaky cam, but I think the fights were shot that way on purpose to show how Gladiators fought by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every time a character gets stabbed, you feel the pain as the stab always feels very realistic without ever feeling over-the-top or ridiculous. The Coliseum looks realistic, and it gave the fights a claustrophobic feeling. During one fighting sequence, they were reenacting ""The Battle of Zama"". A large number of Gladiators were in the middle of the Coliseum and they were surrounded by enemies in chariots. Shortly after the battle started, a few Gladiators were quickly killed off, and it gave the fighting a lot of tension after the viewer learned how much of a disadvantage Maximus had. That was my favorite fight scene in the film.Considering that Ridley Scott is usually pretty good with cinematography (Blade Runner and Black Hawk Down), I had no concern about the cinematography, and I expected it to be really good. I was right. The city of Rome was perfectly captured in the film. Many tableau's of Rome and the Coliseum were beautiful to look at. Rome looked vast, majestic, and full of people. Even the CGI shots were impressive and blended into the film seamlessly. They hold up pretty well today. The only issue I have with the film on a technical level was with its soundtrack that was composed by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard. Some songs felt like they were ripped off of by many other action films. Especially the parts where it sounded like someone was singing in a different language. I've heard that in many other films before and it's starting to feel a bit unoriginal. Other than that, the film worked pretty well from a technical standpoint.I don't think that Russell Crowe should've won an Oscar. His performance wasn't bad. Crowe himself is fine. However, his role is about as basic as you can get for a tough guy role. Any actor with some talent could've done what he did. Speaking of Maximus's character, I could not care for him at all. He's just dour and dull for the entire film, even before his family is killed off. He's bland and unsympathetic from the get-go, and he only gets more revenge filled as the movie continues on. I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I could not care for his character for that reason. I could not care about any of the other protagonists in the film. When a main character died, I didn't care that much for them as I felt like I had just been introduced to them. Their deaths just sort of came and went by. Also, I was not as moved by its ending as I expected I would be before going into this film.Looking around a bit, I've seen several reviewers bring up that its plot of betrayal and revenge has been done to death. If I felt that way, I would most likely have a bigger issue with sympathizing with Maximus. As of now, however, I can't think of any movies which borrowed its plot line that came out before this one was released, and I have yet to see any reviewers name any films with a similar plot as this one. So, until I do, I'm going to put that criticism aside.In conclusion, I wasn't a fan of this movie. It's a real shame, because I was hoping that I could relive my childhood memories of it. I can appreciate it for impressing me with its action and its technical aspect. The action was definitely the highlight of the film, and Rome was also very beautiful to look at. However, much of it seemed wasted since it failed in the most important area: Its characters. Maximus felt like a very generic shell of a character and he seemed very uninteresting. I will always love Ridley Scott though, even though I disliked one of his most popular films.",Gladiator
271,Brogan,Speculator!,8,15 May 2000,"Leave it to Russell Crowe, one of the few actors who actually reads a script for a movie before acting in it.  He has been in two of some of the best movies of the 1990's, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL and THE INSIDER.  Now Crowe proves his marquee star status with his latest film, GLADIATOR.  GLADIATOR is a film in the tradition of BEN HUR, EL CID, and TEN COMMANDMENTS, a classic epic brought into the new millennium. The story is about Maximus (Russell Crowe), a Spanish general fighting for the powerful Roman army.  He is hailed a hero among his soldiers, and admired by his leader, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).  Marcus adores Maximus so much that he would rather see Max, than his own son, Commodus (Jouquin Phoenix) become the future leader of Rome.  Commodus is both hurt and angered by his father's decision, he kills his father, imprisions Maximus, as well as threatens and torments his beautiful sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen).  Maximus escapes Commodus soldiers and discovers that his family is killed and his home is destroyed by Commodus' army. Maximus is then captured and is sold into slavery to become a gladiator, under the rule of Proximo (the late Oliver Reed).  Maximus befriends another slave, Juba (Djimon Hounsou), and together along with Lucilla, and Roman senator Gracchus (Derek Jacobi), they try to defeat the evil rule of Commodus. From start to finish, GLADIATOR is a feast to the eyes and brain.  This is the kind of film that snaggs a couple of Oscar nominations.  Ridley Scott not only proves that he can make a fantastic movies that are in the future (ALIEN & BLADE RUNNER) but also the past, with this film.  From start to finish, and over 150 minutes, Scott manages to makes this film entertaining. With the excellent cinematography, editing, and fight scenes, Scott makes this a unique film placed in the history of cinema. And the acting is also great.  Russell Crowe is excellent, as usual, in his leading role as the faithful and honorable Maximus.  Now maybe, Crowe will become a popular star that he deserved to be since QUICK & THE DEAD.  And Jouquin Phoenix is very vicious and cold as the evil Commodus.  He proves that he can live up to the status that his older brother was in.  Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris are both great as the royal family. And in his final role, Oliver Reed is great as Proximo, the former gladiator who fight his way to freedom. GLADIATOR is a film that both the young and old will enjoy. The old will enjoy it since it's in the same formula as the classic epic film is, and with the great acting.  And the young will enjoy it because of it being so bloody and violent.  But anyone who enjoys brain food with thier summer films will enjoy this film.  Don't miss it!  ***** (out of five)",Gladiator
272,HelloTexas11,entertaining Roman epic,7,8 February 2009,"Aside from its graphic violence, 'Gladiator' is quite the old-fashioned movie; you may even feel you've seen more or less the same story many times before. The plot certainly seems right out of Roman Film Epics 101 as all the reliable ingredients are there. Credit director Ridley Scott and star Russell Crowe for making the familiar appear so fresh again, crafting an intriguing if not exactly mesmerizing film, winning five Academy Awards including for picture and actor and achieving great popular success at the box office. Perhaps enough time had passed for a really good gladiator flick to click with audiences, or perhaps today's crowd has never seen 'Spartacus' or some of the others. For whatever reason, they turned out in droves to see 'Gladiator,' just as the people of Rome turn out to see Crowe's Maximus defeat foe after foe in the arena. Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the 'last good emperor' of Rome, chooses Maximus to be his successor over his own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The son discovers this and kills his father before the succession can be announced and proclaims himself emperor. (Already, you can see where this is going.) Commodus of course is a weak figure, full of despicable traits, including having the hots for his sister, Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). All sorts of conflicts and political intrigue ensue before finally, Maximus and Commodus meet in the arena for a death match. Guess who wins, despite having been mortally wounded just prior to the contest. 'Gladiator' may be the most 'mainstream' film Ridley Scott has ever directed, very straightforward in its storytelling and without as many quirky touches as most of his other movies. Crowe, Phoenix, Harris, and Nielsen all deliver good performances, Crowe in particular winning the audience over, again, just as Maximus does in the movie itself. While there is nothing really remarkable about 'Gladiator,' it is solid entertainment and does not seem nearly as long as its running time suggests, which is always a good thing.",Gladiator
273,Hancock_the_Superb,"A+ action film, C- epic",7,21 December 2007,"In Rome circa 185 AD, General Maximus (Russell Crowe) leads a successful expedition against Germanic tribes in the northern empire. Dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) confides that he is to succeed as Emperor, to the chagrin of the vain, ego-maniacal Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who kills Marcus and usurps the throne. Maximus is expelled from the army, his family is killed, and he ultimately ends up in Rome as a gladiator for Proximo (Oliver Reed). Defying the will of the Emperor and eager to have his revenge, Maximus becomes a hero to the masses and joins Commodus's sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and a cabal of Senators led by Gracchus (Derek Jacobi) in an attempt to bring down Commodus.Gladiator is something of a paradox. As a well-made, entertaining action film, it's hard to beat. Its attempts to be something more, however... not so much. It's very entertaining, an excellent crowd-pleaser to be sure, but it's far from the great film it's widely considered to be.Gladiator wants to be something significant. Its multi-faceted plot, its commentary on society, its distinguished cast of actors, epic battle scenes, and great musical score almost push it there. The movie borrows heavily from ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" (settings and characters), ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben-Hur"" (for the plot). This is not a criticism, merely an observation. And the movie does have an inkling of being something more than just another action movie. And yet it fails, because at heart it is basically ""Braveheart"" in a toga.Perhaps I'm just not enthralled by the film's basic storyline. See if this sounds familiar: A successful warrior who wants only to live in peace is roused to ass-kicking action by the death of his family at the hands of cartoonishly evil villains. This is the plot of ""Braveheart"", ""The Patriot"", and innumerable Westerns, action films, and Steven Seagal/Chuck Norris slugfests. Death of family members is an easy motivation for a character, and dare I suggest a lazy one. Maximus isn't a thoughtful, conflicted hero like T.E. Lawrence or Spartacus, he's just a man of action who wants to wreak vengeance on those who wronged him. In spite of its attempts to convince us otherwise, the movie is basically a Schwarzenegger or Van Damme flick set in Roman times with a lead actor who can act.The subplots of the film don't fare much better. The character of Commodus in particular is a disappointment. One of the few good things about ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" is Christopher Plummer's portrayal of Commodus. Commodus is an egomaniac with delusions of grandeur. He's not horribly complex in that film but Plummer makes it work. Whether it's the script or Joaquin Phoenix's acting, this film's Commodus is a sniveling weakling. I appreciate the effort to give him motivation (his father never truly loved him) but in his big scene with Marcus Aurelius, Commodus doesn't come across as heart-broken, merely insincere. Commodus is a petulant child who lacks menace. David Schofield's duplictious Senator Falco is a much more effective bad guy. The Senate plot against the Emperor is under-developed and comes across as a bad pastiche of ""Spartacus"".On a purely action level, the movie is pretty good. The epic battle which opens the film is not particularly impressive in my opinion, but the gladiator combats later in the film are impressive. The visceral thrill of a gladiatorial match comes across well, particularly when Proximo's gladiators ""upset"" an enemy team. The fight between Maximus and the ""Tigress of Gaul"" is very well-handled, as is the final duel between Commodus and Maximus. The CGI is of mixed quality. It's impressive in some scenes (notably Commodus's entry into Rome) but in other parts it's murky and distracting. Hans Zimmer's score is haunting and helps drive the film's more powerful moments.The movie excels largely because of Russell Crowe. FOTRE failed because Stephen Boyd is a block of wood; Crowe, playing a very similar role, excels. Maximus is not a particularly noble hero but he's a fabulous action star, and Crowe does bring a degree of intelligence and complexity to complement the ass-kicking. The supporting cast is mostly under-used. Djimon Honsou, Oliver Reed, David Schofield and Derek Jacobi give the most memorable supporting performances in the film despite very limited screen time. Richard Harris is disappointing as Marcus Aurelius, and Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen aren't particularly compelling either.""Gladiator"" is one of the best action films ever made, on a purely action level. But in its attempts to be something more... well, not so much, I'm afraid.7/10",Gladiator
274,Ziya90,A milestone historical epic which has been overlooked in time,10,28 June 2013,"Despite, I've been affected negatively by comments like it is overrated or it was not that great in the past, after thinking about it once more, I conclude that Gladiator is a great film. The opening sequence of the movie was remarkable, the bird, Russell Crowe's hands over wheat and the action as a preparation for us. The movie is a first rate historical epic with the help of Ridley Scott the master's craftsmanship in technical aspects such as editing, art direction and the spectacular action scenes. Also great entertainment. The musics are of course fiery and enthusing. The movie is may be too showy at times, but isn't this natural for a movie about gladiator games? It is an effective and impressive film. Russell Crowe is the star of the movie, literally too! He steals the show, but Phoenix is great, a great villain, too. He is unforgettable like the movie itself. Also, you can see the actor who played Conan in the TV series (at that time, I was almost a child) In terms of everything, but especially story telling, Gladiator is much much better than his latter film Kingdom of Heaven. The forest scene at the beginnings requires a little too much suspension of disbelief, but in the end, it was necessary, because there was no other way to do that. The story might be cliché for some, but I think, it was powerful and solid to keep the film throughout. The story editing is a real epic! It is one of the main reasons that make the film a masterpiece in the genre. When I watched the movie for the first time at theater, I was seriously disappointed when I saw the combat area, but then realized that it wasn't The Colosseum when the real movie starts! The CGI was perfect at that time, as I know, it was one of the movies that an improved technology was used for the first time. ""Are you not entertained?"" scene is thought- provoking. The first battle in The Colosseum is worthy of cinema anthology. An unforgettable, iconic, spectacular sequence by Scott! I have no idea how many times I have seen this sequence! As action, may be it is the one of the movie. The craft in this sequence is breathtaking. The tiger sequence is another iconic, unforgettable and well executed part of the movie. In the year, 2000, at theater, I found that masked guy very interesting. The climax of the film was not as climactic as I'd expected, what can I say, I found it a little bit low key, but still a ""deserving"" final.

Before his death, the Emperor chooses Maximus to be his heir over his own son, the wicked Commodus, played by Joaguin Phoenix, and a power struggle leaves Maximus and his family condemned to death.  The powerful general is unable to save his family, and his loss of will allows him to get captured and put into the Gladiator games until he dies.

277,Christopher_Reid,Great acting and story but quite dated and formulaic otherwise.,7,27 June 2008,"I think without a doubt that Gladiator's strengths are its simple but powerful story and its engaging performances. Other than that, however, I think the overall style of the film and the film-making itself are already quite badly dated and forgettable. It doesn't feel like the personal vision of a talented filmmaker (Ridley Scott in this case) but more like an anonymous miniseries with great actors and a very big budget. So, it's good but it should have been great and I find it frustrating because I think it's overrated and I don't know why so many people either can't see or just don't mind what appear to me to be obvious flaws.The action scenes are no longer very special. Braveheart had passionate battle scenes with very precise and skillful choreography. It's not that these ones aren't skillful, but they aren't very original and there's nothing particularly personal about them either. And of course, the special effects are well past their ""best before"" date so that aspect no longer helps a whole lot.Is Hans Zimmer a hack? He blatantly rips off Holst's ""Mars: The Bringer of War"" (and does it badly), not to mention tinges of Vangelis, but maybe Scott is in part to blame for this. His orchestral texture is typical of his scores, there's the obligatory march (that sounds a lot like Pirates of the Caribbean, which he had a hand in, not to mention the Michael Bay movies he's done) and worst of all he employs the subtlety of a sledge hammer when it comes to setting the mood in rousing or emotional scenes. One major exception to this in my opinion was Richard Harris' last scene which I found surprisingly good, as if the director gave him some freedom and he actually liked the scene. Otherwise, Zimmer's music fits the movie, or at least its obvious surface layer, perfectly. No risks. No depth. Plenty of formula.Russel Crowe's performance transcends the dated film-making. It's honest and gritty. Oliver Reed also stood out for me (especially his eyes) while the rest are more than engaging. Coupled with the effective story, the performances make the movie worth seeing (IMHO).So, weakness = formulaic film-making. Strength = story + acting. I reckon if you replaced Hans Zimmer's score with any thematically similar music and re-filmed all the non-dialogue scenes using any competent but disinterested cinematographer, Gladiator would be just as popular as it currently is.",Gladiator
278,bbhlthph,A film that opens the floodgates to what?,1,9 June 2006,"'Gladiator' received numerous awards and has attracted over 2000 largely favourable user comments on IMDb. Although my comments will not be well received by those who regard it as a great film, I believe this is an APPALLING film which should never have been released. A film can be appalling because of bad direction, bad acting, or just plain bad photography - none of these are the problem here. A film can also be appalling because it plagiarises an earlier film too closely without giving any recognition to it, because it is intellectually dishonest, because its contents are antisocial, or because its nature is such that it is highly prejudicial to the film industry as a whole - the last three of these concerns all seem to me to arise with Gladiator. Some IMDb users have expressed concerns about plagiarism - noting its very close structural similarities to 'Braveheart' (1995) and 'Tarkan' (1969), but these are not my concern. When the scenario of a new film is totally different to its predecessor it is hard to justify condemning it for plagiarism.'Gladiator' features exactly the same scenario as the 1964 film 'The Fall of the Roman Empire' which is quite an elegant work that probably deserved to be more successful than it was. But it had one fatal flaw. It was promoted as an historically accurate account of the relatively short historical period when the Roman Empire appears to have undergone a fundamental transformation from an aggressive expansionist would be world empire to a survivalist mode where its main concern became the protection of its existing boundaries. This period, well documented by Gibbon and others, occurred after the death by disease of the stoic Emperor Marcus Aurelius whilst on campaign in A.D. 180. His son Commodus, who had already been co-emperor for three years, assumed full authority at the early age of nineteen with the support of Marcus's trusted advisers, but gradually after four years rule he became increasingly cruel and capricious, showing many signs of insanity, and finally acting in such a way that he was murdered in a palace conspiracy. His successor tried to repair the damage done to the fabric of Roman society but ultimately proved too weak and was murdered in turn, leading to a long period of increasing instability. The highly respected Will Durant was listed as historical consultant for the making of this 1964 film, but his advice was clearly neglected as the film incorrectly showed Marcus rejecting his son as heir to the throne, and his son responding by murdering his father and seizing the throne. Later it showed Commodus killed in the Arena whereas he was in fact drugged and strangled in his palace. Incredibly, this totally fictitious story from the earlier film was repeated in Gladiator. To me this makes the film unacceptable for intellectual dishonesty. We are told it is just a film prepared for entertainment. Fine - BUT ONLY IF IT DOES NOT PURPORT TO BE A HISTORICAL FILM. 'The Sign of the Cross', 'Ben Hur', 'Quo Vadis' and 'Caesar and Cleopatra' were promoted as films of literary works not as historical works, and I have no problem with this. But a film has an enormous audience compared with a historical treatise and, if it is thought to be presenting real history, its inaccuracies can be very misleading. Most people who lived through the holocaust have now died and already a concerted campaign, making extensive use of the media to deny that it ever happened, is under way. If public perception of its reality is ever reduced to the status of a largely mythical event, it will severely handicap the chance of humanity learning essential lessons from history. YES, HISTORICAL ACCURACY IS OF IMPORTANCE, certainly in everything except a declared work of fiction.'Gladiator' is also appalling because much of its appeal comes from the graphic killing of one human being by another in the name of sport. The Roman Games started as athletic contests with readings of literature and dramatic presentations, followed quite early by events involving the public punishment and execution of criminals. The latter evolved into gladiatorial contests where criminals who would be useful in the all important Roman armies could redeem themselves; and much later into the staging of public atrocities which sometimes even featured women and children being killed by wild beasts or burned alive. It has taken humanity many hundreds of years to totally reject such 'entertainment' and pogroms of various types still occur in many parts of the world with alarming frequency. The first step towards establishing higher standards is the banning of public executions, but 'Gladiator' makes extensive use of computer generated images which give all the vicarious thrills of watching whilst one person kills another. It also takes a giant step along the slippery slope of virtual reality which could eventually permit viewers to 'experience' actual participation in such events. IS THIS WHAT WE REALLY WANT FROM THE CINEMA? The 1934 Hayes code which crippled the North American film industry for many years resulted from an overwhelming public demand to restrict films that overstepped the bounds of public acceptability. A third reason why 'Gladiator' is an appalling film is that it has pushed the limits of acceptability to the point where there will be demands for some new form of censorship. Today there is more and more emphasis being put on self regulation whether in government or in corporate life. If the film industry cannot face up to its need for some self regulation IT MAY LOSE ITS ARTISTIC FREEDOM AND BE RETURNED TO THE DARK AGES OF EXTERNALLY IMPOSED PRODUCTION 'CODES'.",Gladiator

He doesn't want the audience to feel left out or downed by not seeing enough, so he shows us everything, from Arms to legs and even heads being mutilated right in front of your eyes.This sequence is one of the many gruelling epic battle sets to follow that punctuate the story of the main character.The plot is fast and thickened to maximum quality. Scott layers the plot so thick that it will be hard not to like. The genius of the editing makes the story and action fast and flowing without leaving anything out.The ensemble cast includes Oliver Reed, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Djimon Hounsou who all provide as much granger and stability as Crowe in the lead role.Verdict: Gladiator is a must-see classic that swells up bold moves by recreating the lost sword and sandal epics that had previously been failing for the past 30 years. But Gladiator hit's not only a revisionary insight into the power of a sword and sandal epic but delivers an emotional impact with it's story and character.",Gladiator

The movie is a great presentation of how things were running in ancient Rome and it manages to touch political, moral, family ethnic stuff... Russell Crowe was a perfect choice for the role and the soundtrack covered the story really nice. Joaquin Phoenix was a great bad guy in this movie, just as it should be for the son of Caesar. Not too much, not too less.. The ending exactly as it should be. Not an unforgettable movie but certainly from one of those historical and war movies that you see from year to year..",Gladiator
281,gogoschka-1,A Masterpiece Of Polished Pulp Cinema,9,27 March 2019,"GLADIATOR is a masterpiece of polished pulp Cinema with all the right ingredients: visceral fights and battles; a beautiful, mysterious woman; a villain you love to hate and a hero with a code of honor (and arms like tree trunks); it has all the drama and heartbreaking betrayals and tragic deaths of a Telenovela and as much blood and testosterone as you'd find in a Rambo movie. It's simply glorious, spectacularly entertaining filmmaking - all delivered straight to the gut and without a shred of irony.And boy is this violent revenge tale and journey to ancient Rome beautiful to look at: every shot is framed like a painting; it's one of those gorgeous looking Ridley Scott films where every landscape becomes as much a protagonist of the film as the actors in it. As for those actors, they are never less than magnetic to watch, and especially Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe stand out; they bring an intensity and all-in approach to their roles that garnered them both Oscar nominations (Crowe won his).I sometimes hear the argument by certain self-professed film critics that GLADIATOR is too pulpy to really be considered a good film. I couldn't agree less. This is one rousing adventure and one beautiful movie with a fantastic cast - and it knows exactly what it wants, and it achieves it to a degree of perfection. It's about as cinematic an experience as film can offer, and it's as watchable today as it was nearly 20 years ago.P.S.

282,kyle-cruse,An epic worthy of Best Picture,9,20 June 2009,"To my surprise, I've read several negative comments on this film, referring to it both as ""fluff"" and a ""Braveheart-wanna-be."" I found ""Gladiator"" to be a well-made, engaging epic and character study of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general who becomes a fugitive and comes back to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge on the ones who killed his family. Maximus is a great character that many people can probably somehow relate to. This is Russell Crowe's best film by a long shot. In the same way that ""Braveheart"" taught us that ""Every man dies, not every man really lives,"" this film teaches us that ""What we do in life echoes in eternity,"" an equally compelling message that resonates both during and long after the movie is over. The film's unique way of depicting the afterlife (which I won't give away here) is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, and the flashbacks between eternity and the battle scenes toward the end are due to Ridley Scott's superb job of directing this film. It's not completely flawless as ""Braveheart"" was, since I could have done without a particular murder sequence and a few of the battle scenes which are a bit repetitive. Nevertheless, I give this film a high recommendation. ""Gladiator"" will entertain and engage you, giving you a lot to think about when living your life.***1/2 out of ****",Gladiator
283,JaydoDre,A very solid movie all-round,9,31 January 2015,"What is cool about Gladiator (besides a whole lot of things) is that it should not offend pro- or anti-Romans. There have been a number of big movies, almost since the beginning of movies, that put Rome into the evil category. This choice echoes from the popular anti-Imperial culture of the 20th and 21st century that favors freedom over unity and order. Sorry, I will stop if that sounds preachy, but the point is: Gladiator gives both sides of the argument and also shows that it is not about the bad and the good sides but rather the bad and the good in the individuals.Gladiator is not the most historically accurate film. After all, they put a whole lot of story conveniently into the events for which there are very few sources for reference. And of course the armor is not going to be perfectly accurate, and of course everything is pumped up. But it actually does a great deal right and looks genuine. The politics get smart toward the middle of the film. This film has depth, though it is not hard to understand.Disguised under all the pomp and depth there is hidden a fairly typical formula for an action movie with a good and a bad guy, a family member in danger, a personal loss, a cheesy honor speech, and of course a mano-a-mano fight, but it is hidden and packaged very well.Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus is not the protagonist but is arguably the main character of the film. The ""evil"" in his character is so refined, deep, believable and even relatable. The cowardice is palpable. He feels like a complex character that creates a good contrast to Russel Crowe's Gladiator, the simpleton soldier with his honor, love and anger issues. Oliver Reed as the gladiator owner was also really good and expressive.The camera work is excellent. The busy sets are filled with good lighting and shots are properly populated, with good atmosphere from all the various fires, mist and snow. Computer generated effects are unfortunately used quite a bit, as the makers would have had a hard time showing the Roman scale without it and yes, some of these effects look dated, but those shots are not shown for long and overall it works.The soundtrack composed by Hans Zimmer is actually not the best if you listen to it on its own but works really well in this movie, especially in battles. It brings the necessary gravity to everything. Speaking of listening to the soundtrack on its own, do try ""The Might of Rome"" when visiting a large city - awesome. Lisa Gerrard brought her voice which is a great recognizable emotional deep contralto, though her main presence in this movie is saved for the credits.The movie is totally rewatchable, and in fact, the second time may reveal many new nuances in the dialogue you may have missed the first time, especially if you are watching the extended addition (which you should). As time passed after its release, this movie was increasingly becoming a hype. Internet memes were being made from it. People kept asking me to make Maximus' armor for a game. This plebeian hype made me increasingly dislike this film by extension, but the fact is that this is a very well-made enjoyable movie.",Gladiator
284,SPZMaxinema,Solidly good film with many enjoyable scenes!,8,23 October 2021,"Aside from a few dull scenes that slowed down the film as well as some minor elements that didn't make a ton of sense, this film was an enjoyable time for both my eyes and ears! Hans Zimmer's score along with much of the cinematography and directing of action scenes, plus for sure Joaquin Phoenix's incredible acting, made this film what it is.

Excellent historical locations, a superb story, great acting and really exciting action scenes. The Gladiator is a story about men, revenge, honor and bravery. And it's perfect in every way. You couldn't find a more masculine character than Maximus, and this character fits the great story perfectly. Good job, Russel Crowe. It was also interesting to see Ralph Moeller as one of the gladiators. The first battle in Germania is especially awesome. I guess it's one of the most well made battles in movie history. The only slightly negative comment I have about this film, is that the ending is a cliché and too much of a Hollywood ending. But that's easily forgotten in this true masterpiece. By the way, the music is VERY good.",Gladiator

What a great movie. I'm sure everything's been said about it, so I won't way much more.
Solid story and acting, there's nothing to complain in that matter!
My favourite thing about it is the cinematography and production design. Everything looks so detailed and realistic in terms of scenery and costume design, it's amazing. Beautifully shoot.
There's a lot of little facts I've read about gladiators referred in the movie, looks like there was a lot of research.
Great sound too, even though some times felt a bit overused in certain scenes...
One of the most hateful villain I've seen in movies!

287,ryan_kuhn,A Guy's Night Out,7,13 February 2005,"This is the guy's movie. No way around it. There's armies in combat, there's a father and son drama, there's gladiators (no duh, in a movie called Gladiator), there are women in skimpy outfits, and by the end, more violence. Not that any of this is bad. You just need to know what to expect when seeing this 2000 Oscar winner for best picture. Oscar winner Russel Crowe plays Maximus, a general in the Roman army who is next in line to be ruler of Rome, as the rightful Emperor-to-be Commodous (Joaquin Phoenix) is bypassed by Caeser Marcus Arillias (Richard Harris) in his final attempt to bring back to the old republic. After the Caesar's death, Commodous orders the execution of Maximus, which begins the epic portion of Gladiator. By the end of the movie, scores are settled, more battles are won, legacies are sealed, and every man in the audience has seen everything he could have wanted. No romance here, so the ladies will have to rely on seeing Russel Crowe running around without much clothes on. The best performance for my money is by the late Oliver Reed, who died while filming was in progress. Reed plays an emotionally unattached slave trader who trains Gladiators to fight in Rome. The movie looks good, for the most part. The computer generated Rome leaves something to be desired however, as the buildings look metallic and cold and some of the people watching the Gladiators are out of focus and not wearing togas. For shame, no togas!!! It's a great man's movie which have some small faults to it, but still good nonetheless.",Gladiator
288,Rathko,Six Years Later and Still the Best,10,20 December 2006,"'Gladiator' was the movie that proved that sword-and-sandal epics were still economically viable, leading the way for 'Troy', 'Alexander', and 'Kingdom of Heaven'. It remains the best of the bunch, a near miracle considering that half of it was written well into production and one of the leads (Oliver Reed) died half way through filming.The screenplay displays none of the usual problems usually associated with multiple writers and battling egos. It is structurally sound, admirably balancing action with drama, and the characters are all well rounded, complex and believable. Scott proves once again that he is one of the best director's around when it comes to 'action with a heart', and his vision of 2nd century Roman Europe is beautifully extended by flawless CGI that achieves exactly what it should while never drawing attention to itself. Arthur Max and Janty Yates, regular Scott collaborators, do an excellent job of bringing a warts-and-all grittiness and realism to the movie. Though the designs aren't that authentic (Imperial interiors were rarely all-black!), they play a large part in ridding the genre of the traditional toga-party kitsch.The leads are excellent. It's to be expected that Richard Harris and Derek Jacobi can do this stuff in their sleep, and Djimon Hounsou has been playing the same role of proud and stoic nobility, albeit very well, ever since 'Amistad'. But Joaquin Pheonix, in his first real adult role, somehow manages to make a sympathetic character out of what amounts to a murdering, incestuous sociopath, and with all due respect to Benecio del Toro, the Oscar that year should have belonged to Pheonix. Russell Crowe, for all his off-screen nonsense, is able to consistently deliver such natural performances that he completely inhabits his characters and was fully deserving of his Oscar win.'Gladiator' is an excellent movie  a textbook example of how these kinds of movies SHOULD be done. It's a shame that the subsequent sword-and-sandal movies haven't come close to the quality of this movie. 'Gladiator' remains the benchmark and it will be a long time before it is surpassed.",Gladiator
289,MF210,Ridley Scott's Best Film To Date,9,14 September 2003,"My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****. Although Gladiator is not my favorite Ridley scott film (that title belongs to Alien), I do believe it to be his best achievement. Gladiator features things Scott has improved upon from his past movies. Gladiator features some great acting, impressive direction, and very satisfying visuals.
The acting is a major strength. Russell Crowe applys himself in this role and does a very good job, he is a perfect gladiator. Connie Nielsen does an admirable job. The standout is Joaquin Phoenix, who is brilliant as Commodus, he makes the villain so deliciously evil that hes impossible to like. The supporting cast all do strong jobs too.There is a dark tone in Gladiator. Its especially evident with the scenes between Commodus and his father. Also, between him and his sister.
The film also has stunning visuals. Great Sets, Good Cinematography, and Stunning Costumes. The Visual Effects are also top notch. The fight scenes are also expertly filmed. A Film with all these stunning visuals may lack a good script, but this film does not. Its script may not be its biggest strength, but it is well written. The film also features a rousing score. Gladiator pretty much remains entertaining throughout, it is a violent film but I wouldnt say its gratuitous. Gladiator is definitely worth your while to see.",Gladiator
290,Gunn,Terrific Historical Epic!,10,5 September 2009,"This movie ranks up there with Ben Hur, Spartacus, The Fall of the Roman Empire (the same story as Gladiator minus the Gladiator and with the second best chariot race on film), Quo Vadis, The Robe and others. The cast is superb from Oscar winner Russell Crowe to Joaquin Phoenix, the late, great Richard Harris, Oliver Reed (in his last role), David Hemming, Derek Jacobi, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Honsou and the rest. Ridley Scott keeps it moving at break-neck pace and has created a masterpiece. I won't go into the plot, but I will say it is nail biting tense, stunningly beautiful, very moving and even heartbreaking. If there's not enough action in this one for you, well then, you'll never be satisfied. I should mention the awesomely magnificent music score by the great Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard.

Crowe finally solidified his place in the acting community with this flawless performance and hasn't let up since. I will never forget the look on his face when he won the Academy Award for Best Actor he looked like he had been told he just won the lottery as I am quite sure he was thinking he was gonna get rear ended yet again. From start to finish you are awestruck with how great this masterpiece is. Ancient Rome never looked so good and the beauty and intense savagery is captured like water in a bottle. It also puts every movie that came out that year to absolute shame without doubt or question. It stands toe to toe with the best epic movies of all time, including Braveheart, Spartacus, and of course Ben-Hur which was by mine and many other accounts the best epic movie ever made. They put together the best cast Hollywood could assemble and knocked out audiences all over the world. Phoenix puts on a great show and certainly deserved the acclaim given him for it I was disappointed he didn't win an Oscar but very glad he was nominated.

However the Romans of that period in history did not have tempered steel (which made its debut in the 14th Century) but is sure looked better on screen than the iron or bronze weapons the real gladiators would have carried.There is true genius in this film:  costuming, photography, art direction and most of all the acting and direction.Ridley Scott outdid himself.  The sheer size, scope and grandeur are breathtaking.Russell Crowe heads an incredible international cast that had to truly believe in this film to achieve the greatness that the audience sees on the screen.Whoever did the matte paintings (no credit given) be they on the traditional glass or CGI deserves a special mention.

I had several problems with the movie.1) It was WAY too long as so many movies are nowadays. It ran about 2:30. It wasn't that it was boring, it is just that it could EASILY have been 1/2 hour shorter and it would have been better. It bordered on dragging almost throughout. There were a few exciting scenes, but even they were too long. Minus 1 point.2) The fights were less than spectacular. I was very impressed with the sets, dress and scale. It was truly an epic in that sense. However, the fights were weak. Compared to Zorro and Matrix, the fight scenes in this movie were low tech.

This is incredibly boring and dull. The story is unoriginal and uninteresting. Perhaps the action sequences will be saving grace. Perhaps not. The action sequences were choppy and very hard to follow and The opening battle scene is so poorly directed that I did not know what was going on at all. Terrible.The acting was wooden. Russel Crowe was not Oscar winning here at all. Phoenix also was not good here as the evil son. I did not see anyone enjoying their roles here at all.

296,sandnair87,A Colossal Performance by Crowe makes this an Epic Thrill-Packer!,9,27 March 2015,"You will swoon with woozy delight over Ridley Scott's thrilling, burnished epic 'Gladiator' - a sweaty, stylish hunk-fest that takes you back to the Roman era. It is so insanely enjoyable and carried off with such dash and chutzpah, that it makes you wonder where this genre has been all your life. Worried about the judgment of history as he ends his days with Rome in a swirl of political instability, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) charges his favorite general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), over his petulant son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) to whip Rome back into shape and return power to the people. Maximus wants no part of the offer and yearns to return to his family. But before this wish can become reality, Commodus intervenes, triggering a series of events that changes the future of the Roman Empire. An attack on Maximus and his family relegates the once-great hero to a shattered, anonymous slave. Purchased by a crafty spectacle promoter, he's trained as a gladiator. The man who once fought for his nation and its ideals now fights to provide thrills to a bloodthirsty mob, constantly enduring Commodus' envy and the ignominy of being a slave. But it is as a slave- gladiator that Maximus finds the way to serve Rome once again, and help deliver on his promise to the late Emperor. Gladiator is film-making at its finest (Ridley Scott in top form), painted on the grandest of canvases, and yet, one which maintains the finest eye for detail. Right from its opening frames of hand-to- hand butchery, Gladiator simply grabs you by the balls and never lets go. On the surface, it's a terrific yarn with rounded characters, agonizing suspense and visceral thrills. Look closer and you'll find rich historical themes, and a harrowing critique of violence as amusement. The depiction of the random savagery amid which the issue has to be confronted is astonishing lending the action sequences an elegiac quality. The atmospherics are so robust that you can almost smell the sweat pouring from the Colosseum as Maximus battles both man and beast for the amusement of the masses. The mob's cheers make a chilling counterpoint to our close-up views of carnage.True, Gladiator is full of arresting splendor and technical virtuosity. But the camera only has eyes for Maximus as Crowe puts a stranglehold on stardom with his performance. The man exudes a physicality comparable to the beasts he has to combat in the arena and holds the screen with such conviction and force you simply can't rip your eyes away from him. Gladiator does indeed deliver the glory that was Rome: a sprawling, enthralling orgy of blood, passion, betrayal and revenge. A gloriously entertaining thrill-packer of truly epic proportions!",Gladiator

298,The_Orenda,Extremely entertaining.,8,17 October 2007,"Bringing back the epic genre, Gladiator makes the classics Ben-Hur and Spartacus proud by recreating the wonder, grit and feel of being in Ancient Rome. An exceptional effort was done by all involved. The costumes, the cinematography, the choreography, even the music itself, Gladiator is deserving in all of its awards and nominations received. Let us not forget the actors themselves. Truly, Gladiator is one film that will stand the test of time for many years to come.General Maximus helps Marcus Aurelius keep Germania under check, but who will do the same for Rome in the case of the Caesar's death? Marcus doesn't think his son, Commodus will do any good in charge. ""No morals,"" the Caesar claims, but Commodus thinks of himself as merciful, by killing his father, Maximus' family and intimidating the Senate. Maximus survives his own assassination attempt and swears to right wrong and get revenge.Some of the best action sequences are seen in Gladiator. A couple of those are the first fights in the Colosseum. Joaquin Phoenix does an outstanding job himself playing the villain Commodus. The scenes with him and Lucius are some of the more terrifying I've seen, particularly since Ridley Scott does a good job portraying their bond from Lucilla's perspective. Proximo stated to Maximus that he had to win the crowd, and surely by doing that, he won movie-goers as well, as this will remain one of Russell Crowe's finest performances. Epic, blockbuster and critically acclaimed, Gladiator had earned its Academy Award for Best Picture, and then some.",Gladiator
299,budmassey,Are you not entertained?,10,19 February 2001,"From the opening moments of Gladiator, and till the last, it is clear that you are being treated to Oscar® quality entertainment. Ridley Scott, who directed one of my all-time favorites, Blade Runner, almost never misses. But few directors can ever hope to hit the mark so cleanly and convincingly as Scott does with Gladiator. Gladiator is magnificent, thrilling, moving, epic, heroic and a dozen other things so conspicuously absent in so many movies and so abundantly present here.Russell Crowe was born to play this role, and he occupies the character with epic vigor and a presence that has a tendency to overpower a scene. It is, of course, true that Crowe's ego made him nearly impossible to work with, and he is said to have proclaimed during filming that he was the greatest actor in the world. There are, in fact, moments in the film where it would be difficult to argue with him. Still, he has subtle moments as well. There is a scene, late in the movie. Maximus is near the end of an epic struggle and all the contentious forces of Rome are whirling around him. He is asked by Lucilla, the emperor's sister, with whom he apparently had an affair years ago, if all that had happened made her seem different. Crowe replies, with stunning understatement, ""You laughed more."" I knew in that moment that Crowe had won the Oscar®, and deservedly so. The story is, quite simply, largely fabrication, though to some extent based on fact. It is true that Commodus was the only Roman emperor to fight in the Coliseum, although his battle with Maximus, as well as its magnificent conclusion, is entirely fictionalized. In fact, Maximus Decimus Meridius is a completely fictitious character perhaps composited by screenwriter David Franzoni and director Ridley Scott, who clearly gave themselves full literary license to rewrite the relatively common story of Commodus into something breathtakingly memorable.Hollywood has been in the movie business a long time. There are many great movies, but few are great on the scale of Gladiator. Every aspect of Gladiator comes together so spectacularly that any shortcomings it may have are easily overlooked. Scott's inspired direction, Hans Zimmer's thrilling score, supplemented by Lisa Gerrard's stirring vocals; all conspire magically to contribute to Gladiator's success. John Mathieson's cinematography, which Scott relied on in Robin Hood and Hannibal as well, is painterly and dark, perfectly matched to the story and characters. There are movies of the genre, towering achievements in cinema from decades past, held in higher regard than Gladiator, but in many ways even they are not Gladiator's equal. Gladiator is not only a peer to the likes of Spartacus and Ben Hur, but, ultimately, their superior. And for the curious, or the skeptical, I would put the Battle of Carthage scene up against the Chariot Race scene any day. Perhaps it isn't as disturbingly, agonizingly long, but the heroism and courage played out in the Carthage scene is without equal. A few of the common problems with epic films are necessarily present. Some of the characters are not fully developed, which, given the story arc, is common in epic films which are based on events rather than subtle characterizations. As for historical inaccuracies, much cited in derision of the film, I don't think Scott is presently seeking an endowed chair in History at any major university, so if he took a few liberties with a well-known story to heighten the drama, I can only reply with a quote from the main character; ""Are you not entertained?"" The lore surrounding Gladiator is definitely fascinating. Oliver Reed, who died during principle filming, had to be recreated digitally in some scenes. Despite the difficulty of this effort, it was less expensive than refilming Reed's scenes and many of the cast insisted that Reed remain a part of the film. Richard Harris is rumored to have refused to learn rewrites, complicating his scenes early in the film. In both cases, their immense contributions to the film make it all worthwhile. Scott's signature touches, a washed-out color palette, the ubiquitous slow motion splattering of blood, and, most notably his tendency to magnify characters by using tight close-ups against backgrounds compressed by the application of telephoto lenses, may have been a bit overdone, but the combined effect heightens the action, the drama and the characters and somehow imbues them with a sense of history fitting the story.In short, Gladiator may be the best sandals and swords epic ever, and a worthy heir to the mantle handed down from its predecessors. Russell Crowe is glorious as the brooding and relentless gladiator bent on revenge. Joaquin Phoenix is electric as the devious and ambitious Commodus, and without a doubt should have received the Best Supporting Actor nod. With Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, sadly both now deceased, added for flavor, this is as great an epic as any. So many reviewers want to dislike movies that are popular, as if it proves that they are gifted with an appreciation of fine cinema that escapes lesser moviegoers. I say nonsense. The reason everyone thinks this movie is great is because it is great. It's beautiful, it's moving, it's just plain fun. Grab some popcorn and prepare to be entertained.",Gladiator
300,danielll_rs,Thumbs up!,5,26 May 2000,"Rating: ***1/2 out of ****WARNING: SOME THINGS HERE CAN BE CONSIDERED SPOILERSI like art-house films. I really do. OK, some of them are really dull and boring, but can you complain of Almodovar's and Buñuel's pictures, or the Kielowski trilogy of colors? I can't. I also like very much films that stay in the middle- are not simply artistic or simply entertaining: ""Magnolia"" (last year's best, by the way), ""American Beauty"", ""2001"". But for every ""That Obscure Object of Desire"" there's a ""Gladiator"". Not that ""Gladiator"" is empty (it talks about honor, courage, revenge), but its aim is to entertain audiences. So what? Let's have fun with it!As every $100+ million budget movie, ""Gladiator"" is visually stunning and perfectly done and executed. The visuals are so great, vibrating and realistic that we feel we are in the ancient Rome of emperors and gladiators. After so many boring and dull films (""1492""- a joy to our eyes but empty as a hollow piece of wood- and ""G.I. Jane""- that I, personally, felt ashamed to watch), Ridley Scott comes back with all his strength. It may be a little early, but he deserves a best director nomination at next year's Oscar. The way he recreates battle scenes and fight sequences in the Coliseum is amazing, almost unbelievable. My biggest disappointment with Luc Besson's ""The Messenger"" was the way he directed the battle scenes. It was the same thing of seeing a tomato being cut in slices, with Milla Jovovich yelling in the background. In ""Gladiator"" it's just the opposite. There's a battle scene in Germania. Only one, but it's so real, bitter, the best since ""Saving Private Ryan"". Thumbs up for you, Mr. Scott! Resurrect the old Rome is not for everyone, nor resurrect the epic genre, which was dead since... I don't know, for a long time. Believe it or not, ""Gladiator"" can be put on the same level of ""Spartacus"" or ""Ben-Hur"". May the epic genre stay with us and go on like this!One of the greatest merits of ""Gladiator"" (and also where its flaws are) is its screenplay. The film has 2 hours and a half, but I didn't feel it that long. I'm not against long picture (see ""Magnolia""), but entertaining films can't be boring. Well, there are slow moments in the film here and there- and that's the only visible flaw I can see. But, taking this, the screenplay is a joy. The characters have a good development, their lines are well written and the situations are emotional and intriguing. The cast just helps to keep our interest. Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nielsen, who I think would be real problems for me, give solid performances. He is Commodus, son of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), who kills the own father to get the throne. Summarizing, the villain. Phoenix is surprising and sometimes haunting. Nielsen is pretty and strong as Lucilla, Commodus' sister and object of his incestuous desire. But Russell Crowe is the big star here. He is Maximus, a general of Marcus Aurelius' troop. The emperor is old and weak, and promises him the throne. Knowing this, Commodus kills his father and orders his soldiers to kill Maximus and his family. He escapes, but his wife and son die. He becomes a slave, but starts to show his talent of fighting. He is sent to Rome as a gladiator, looking for revenge against Commodus. Everything will be solved in the final scenes, which reminded me ""Hamlet"" for some reason- and will make some people cry. But let's talk about Crowe. After terrific performances in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Insider"", he can receive his second Oscar nod with justice. He builds Maximus as a brave, strong, but also heartfelt man. Thumbs up for him too!Talking about 'thumbs-up', everything in ""Gladiator"" deserves this. It's not an unforgettable masterpiece, but I won't be angry if it becomes a classic. It delivers solid entertainment and has a strong dramatic side. What else do we need?",Gladiator
301,Ibuk,Gladiator - a very pleasant surprise,8,4 November 2007,"I walked into the cinema not knowing how this movie was going to turn out. Right from the word go I was gripped till the end. The fight scenes were some of the best I have ever seen. Until this movie I had never seen an historical epic and this movie got me hooked on them. At almost 3 hours it may seem long but you will engrossed in the movie that time will fly by.Russell Crowe was magnificent as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix was superb. This movie is famous for having Oliver Reed's last performance, he died during the filming and some of his scenes are computer generated. Ridley Scott as the director is extremely good.

303,merrywood,A Beautifully Realized Film,9,12 May 2000,"We had grown used to Ridley Scott missing in action when it came to story concept, plotline and story elements.  He seems to have gotten away with these shortcomings because his taste for visual aesthetics is peerless.  He is one of the few working directors whose grasp of visual beauty is constant and always gratifying.	In Gladiator, we are once again surprised because the grapevine said that the script was not really finished at the start and it kept changing with more than one writer in the pot mix.  Indeed, the Gladiator story is superficial and the concept as old as the hills of Rome, but one can delight in the hearing of an old song once more, finely rendered.          Unquestionably, this is a beautifully realized film.  It has all the elements, atmospheric musical score and a fine lead player with a solid supporting cast.  It did not get an overall excelent vote from me due to the current in-style dark lensing and film processing, apparently to look realistic or just to copy an awful dark style we first noticed on television, copied now by nearly everyone and as such will immediately lock the film into a quickly dated style as in the overuse of zoom lenses in the early 70s and similarly, with the Steadicam a few years later.  Heavy style like this serves only to date a film and cut its legs. This brooding, dark style would have worked fine in the north country scenes, the Germanium campaign, but when it continues into sunny Rome and then, worst of all, becomes even darker in the depiction of the Astral Plane in the final scenes, we had to wince.  The Astral Plane, for those who have been fotunate enough to visit it during meditation, if anything, is gloriously luminescent.       Here, we also bid good-bye to Oliver Reed, who died with three his scenes left undone.   The scenes are not missed, but some of us will miss Reed.

305,OneAnjel,Enrapturing dramatization of historical accounts,10,7 November 2021,"Russel Crowe had been in film before Gladiator, but it seemed he burst into meteoric stardom at that point. This film still adorns many of the top best films lists, no small thanks to Ridley Scott, of course, and the many amazing performances here by many well-regarded actors. Gladiator is always a great watch. It's perfectly paced, the costumes are spectacular, the videography is stunning, and we truly feel connected to the protagonist with the emotion exquisitely coaxed at just the right moments. Anyone who doesn't shed a tear at the end can't be trusted.I see many reviews are compelled to say this is an inaccurate depiction. Well, it's not a documentary but a possible scenario based on the main facts that we do know and eked into a great story about one man who obviously is fictional. On a website called Welcome to Ancient Roman History Revival, the author writes in depth about Gladiator, and in part he says: While it is obvious that an impressive amount of historical and scholarly research was undertaken by the filmmakers, much of the plot is fiction. The fiction does, however, appear to be inspired by actual historical events.",Gladiator
306,kergillian,"Sorry Russell, Mel beat ya to it!",6,6 April 2001,"Welcome to Braveheart, the Prequel! The similarities to Braveheart are*uncanny*! In fact, the only real differences between this and Braveheart (aside from the time period) are that Braveheart has a better script, more clever dialogue, better acting, far less horribly cheezy melodrama, and *much* less spit and polish. In fact, Gladiator is *so* polished that most of it looks *beyond* fake! The tigers were so obviously CGI'd that you could see the superimposition most of the time. And the squibs were obvious as well.And the melodrama!! Don't get me started on the melodrama!!! Braveheart should've cut the last 10 minutes you say? Gladiator should have cut the last half hour! Horribly cheezy death scenes followed by some of the worst schlock I've *ever* seen. His buddy burying his little figures as he meets his dead wife and child in the recurring wheat field dream-zone. I feel *something* rising inside of me, but believe me it's not tears...Phoenix was awful and unconvincing (he should watch a few of his late brother's films to learn a couple of things about acting...) and Russell Crowe is so far behind his role in LA Confidential that he's barely worth mentioning...which is frightening, because save for the always fabulous Oliver Reed's too small role, Crowe was actually a standout.Ridley, Ridley, Ridley, what are we to do with you?? First White Squall, now this??? Come one now! And get over the lightning already!! And the pacing!!! OUCH!! It's slow, it's fast, it's slow, it's fast, it's an action film, it's a melodrama, it's an action film...Make up your bleeding mind!! Pacing was horrid! And most of those slow-paced scenes dragged on *way* too long...Admittedly, *some* of the cinematography and sets were amazing (as is usual for Ridley Scott) but most was much less than I'd expect from one of the greatest scenic directors in modern cinematic history. Even aside from all of the hype, this film needed to chop off at least 30-40 minutes, ease up on the too-special special effects and get itself a decent cast. Oscar my butt! My advice? Save yourself two and a half hours and go see Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon instead...or Braveheart...each has everything this doesn't. 6/10.",Gladiator

308,cdjh-81125,A Movie That Everyone Will Watch At Some Point,10,21 October 2016,"Ridley Scott's Gladiator is and always will be one of my all time favourite movies and I have a problem with anyone who calls this movie overrated. The story in this movie is simple but it works perfectly it allows you to easily get behind Maximus played masterfully by Russell Crowe. Russell Crowe is amazing in this movie he turned a simple character into a compelling and damaged character and he earned his Oscar I could not have seen anyone else playing this character. Joaquín Phoenix was also fantastic here he just is so perfect at making you despise him while also being able to understand his inner turmoil and motives. Thought this movie is much deeper than a bunch of Gladiator matches it is what many casual movie fans will watch this for and their filmed perfectly, Ridley Scott did an amazing job at filming these sequences they feel gritty and realistic. Both the physical and psychological warfare that goes on between Phoenix and Crowe is riveting to watch and always puts you on edge to see what either one of them will do next. You really feel like the crowd in the arena are the true enemy, as if they are the deciders of who will live or die and creates for some very intense sequences. The quieter scenes between Phoenix and Neilson really gives you incite into Commodus' mind you really see a whole other side to him and you see that he's not just a character for the audience to hate but a wounded broken man weighed down by the life thrown upon him. One of the greatest scenes in movie history is the ending to this movie it is just masterful, few times has a character arc come together so perfectly. The final fight between Protagonist and Antagonist is riveting you truly feel as if this is the decider and really showcases both their skills. When Maximus finally lets go and dies instead of feeling sadness you feel happiness that he has achieved what he had to and is now ready to be with his family once more and it is beautiful to watch. Djimon Honsous last scene is also beautiful it gives you one last chance to truly see how their friendship has blossomed. Gladiator is a masterpiece it's, in my opinion, Ridley Scott's best movie every thing about it works and I hate the fact that so many people have turned against this movie and I will never understand why they do.

309,thedarkhorizon,A world reinvented - bigger than life on screen.,8,26 December 2019,"I was totally impressed by the craftmenship in this film. The sunlit city, reinvented with CGI and tons of real life sets, the extras, the props, the costumes and just the sheer amount of detail in the pictures struck me. It delivers the power and greatness of the Roman Empire and the power struggle of the characters in it.For me, the performance of Joaquin Phoenix was even more powerful and detailed than Crowe's, but that is up to taste, I guess.The music and Ridley Scotts skill to bring large entities (such as an old empire) with images back to life is one of the greatest trades shown in this film for me. Like blade runner... a masterpiece, showing a different society, politics but still relatable human struggles in a struggling world.

311,C22Man,A Decent Action Epic Over-Hyped as Something its Not,5,30 June 2016,"Gladiator should be the type of film that I enjoy. Ridley Scott taking on something much grander than anything he had previously. A cast of fine actors led by Russell Crowe. A return to the sword-and- sandal epics of years gone by. It's a film of fine visual finesse, engaging action sequences and large themes. So why is it that Gladiator left me feeling so cold? Well it falls flat in its two most important areas, story and characters.It follows the gruff general Maximus who is named protector of Rome by Marcus Aurelius, that is until Aurelius is murdered by his own son Commodus who has Maximus exiled and his family killed. From here you can see exactly where the film is going. Maximus finds himself as a slave and is sold to a gladiator trainer named Proximo (played by the always great Oliver Reed) who wants to take him to Rome and help him fight his way to the top. This story is about as basic and clichéd as humanly possible. The hero is betrayed and fights his way back in order to get his revenge. That is effectively the main premise of the film. For such simplicity to work the film has to either add twists to the story or be incredible detailed, yet it does neither.The story also contains a weirdly handled sub-plot about Commodus trying to crush the senate who are constantly attempting to make him tackle real issues instead of hosting games. This could have been a decent side story but it's never fleshed out enough to leave an impact. Involved in basically every story thread is Commodus' sister Lucilla, who he also happens to want a child with (yes, he's that kind of kooky), and she becomes a plot device to link all of these pieces together. Joaquin Phoenix hams it up big time as Commodus and to be fair he is clearly meant to be a pantomime villain and Phoenix is probably the only person having fun in the entire film. Connie Nielsen deserves credit too for holding her own despite her incredibly underwritten character.Of course when Maximus and his gladiators get to Rome, they smash through all that stand in their way leading to the crowd turning over to Maximus' side and an inevitable confrontation with Commodus. How Russell Crowe won an Oscar for his performance is a mystery. Crowe himself is fine, but the role is as basic tough guy as it comes and anyone with a bit of muscle could have played the role as it is. Maximus is simply a poor leading character. He's just dour and dull as a rock for the entirety of the film, even before his family are killed off. What's is also notable is that the character doesn't grow. He's a bland, unsympathetic slab from the get-go who just becomes slight more revenge-fuelled as things progress. How can we empathise with this type of main character?Clearing those obstacles, I have little problems with the film on a technical level. It's Ridley Scott so you know the film with be very detailed and beautiful on a visual level and that is exactly what we get. Rome looks magnificent. Vast, majestic and full of people, whilst even the CGI is impressive and manages to blend in seamlessly. The film has an almost dirty brown, hazy look to it that actually works to its advantage. It fits the sullen mood that many of the gladiator's find themselves in. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard provide a score that feels like it's been ripped off by every action movie since it, especially the pieces where Gerrard appears to be singing in a made up language.The action scenes are a highlight. There is a grittiness to them that works for this time period. They not that well-choreographed and I thing that ways purposefully done, in order the show how many of the gladiators were fighting by using sheer aggression and desperation. Every stabbing or wounding looks and sounds painful and not in an overblown or unnatural way. The Coliseum looks fabulous and the films gets across the intimidating atmosphere of having to fight in there. I do have problems with how easily Maximus rises to the top, seeing as he's able to lead the gladiators through tough battles and defeat the only undefeated gladiators with relative ease. Then the climax eventually boils down to Maximus v Commodus and its entirely predictable and just a boring way to end.What is notable is that Gladiator didn't affect me on an emotional level at all. Even comparable epics like 'Braveheart', which shares similar issues, moved me. Gladiator left me numb. I didn't care about Maximus' plight because I was just given a shell of a character to try and get behind. I wasn't engaged in the story because it was simply a downbeat repeat of a storyline that has been done to death. I didn't even care on a basic level to see the villain get his comeuppance. All the talks of political treachery, what it means to be a gladiator and of meeting again in the afterlife just seemed like pieces to fill the film out. I can't deny that the film is a technical marvel or say that it bored me, but I can state that is built upon a story and set of characters that are wholly uninteresting.",Gladiator

313,movieman-200,As resplendently near perfect as you'd expect it to be; Gladiator resurrects the Roman Epic from cinema oblivion,9,30 August 2005,"Ridley Scott's Oscar winning 'Gladiator' (2000) effectively resurrects the Roman epic from oblivion and to thunderous effect. The film stars resident Aussie heartthrob, Russell Crowe as Maximus, a loyal General to the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (the late and very great Richard Harris). After a victorious campaign in Germania, Marcus decides that Maximus will succeed him on the throne; a move that does not bode well with the Emperor's only son and legitimate heir, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Determined to secure his birthright, Commodus murders his father before he has a chance to tell Maximus of his placement, and shortly thereafter frames Maximus for that murder. And although Commodus' sister  and sometimes incestuous playmate, Lucilla (Connie Nielson) is both enamored and loyal to her father and Maximus there is little she can do but acquiesce to Commodus' sycophantic desire to be loved, in order to keep his psychotic wrath at bay. Escaping certain death, Maximus returns home to discover that his wife and young son have been slaughtered under Commodus' authority. From here on, the story develops magnificently along the lines of a revenge tragedy, sumptuously fleshed out by a series of stunning digital visual effects. And although this reviewer has never been a fan of digital manipulation in cinema (for most of it betrays total integration with elements of the story), for once at least the thought-numbing grandeur of ancient Rome seems to have been the perfect compliment to the prowess of technical wizardry. The screen is filled with gorgeous, mesmerizing  and for the most part  realistic renderings of the coliseum and senate, the byways and winding streets of ancient Rome, and the reinvented rustic countryside and battlefields peppered with barbarism. Derek Jacobi, David Schofield and the late Oliver Reed, round out the cast with superb character performances. The screenplay by David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson keeps every plot entanglement sharp and moving in a linear fashion, culminating in a series of climactic battles that ultimately ensure a showdown between Commodus and Maximus and seal their fates. If one complaint may be levied at the production, it's at its sometimes heavy handed use of camera panning and film editing that generally makes a rabid coleslaw of the action sequences  never once allowing the viewer to rest on an image but instead having to endure a barrage of snippets wielded as though under the disguise of being visually paint-balled. On occasion these sequences grow more tiresome than thrilling  a quality tempered by the rest of the movies attention to detail and formidable direction. Ridley Scott, long overdue for the Oscar as Best Director, was again overlooked for the honors on this occasion  a genuine shame. Though, at least in this reviewer's mind, nothing will ever rival the titanic and emotional swell of William Wyler's Ben-Hur (1959), Gladiator is a close second on both accounts; a vivid, powerful and ultimately satisfying bit of escapism that should continue to thrill as long as there are fans of the sword and sandal quickie. Gladiator has been re-released in a handsome three disc set from Dreamworks. This set includes both the theatrical cut and a newly assembled director's vision for the film that is 17 minutes longer. In both cases Dreamworks has gone back to the drawing board and remastered the image  removing much of the heavy and distracting edge enhancement that accompanied its first release on DVD nearly four years ago. Though digital images still tend to appear a tad harsher, or more finely defined than the rest of the image  thereby betraying the fact that they are more blue screen than actual set design, the muddy color scheme that plagued the original DVD have been greatly corrected on this reissue. Fine detail is superbly rendered. Contrast and shadow levels are perfectly realized. The stylized look of the film is more finely rendered this time around. Truly, there is nothing about the image to dissuade one from indulging in the splendor of this epic storytelling. The audio is 5.1 and appears to be the same audio mix as the previously issued DVD. It's sonically bombastic and a great compliment to the image. Extras on this occasion include all of the previously issued material  some slightly fleshed out with added material that ably fleshes out the production from start to finish. There's also a new audio commentary and intro to the extended edition from Ridley Scott, a trivia track and snippets of Russell Crowe speaking on his participation in the film. On disc 2 there are seven featurettes  which cumulatively add up to one 3hr and 20 min. documentary on the making of the film. Disc 3 includes a visual effects reel and insight into several abandoned sequences, as well as trailers, television spots and previews.",Gladiator
314,Bil-3,**** 1/2 Excellent return to sword-and-sandal epics,9,18 May 2001,"Ridley Scott's best film in years is this astonishing epic of Roman proportions about a great general (Russell Crowe) who is demoted to gladiator slave when the kindhearted emperor (Richard Harris) dies and his selfish and callous son (Joaquin Phoenix) takes over. The plot moves smoothly over its vast size without stopping for a second, climaxing in excellent fight scenes that combine state of the art sound effects with Scott's unbeatable visual flair. Crowe gives a star making performance as the lead, and Connie Nielsen stands out in a pretty ineffective role as the princess who must watch her brother destroy everything her beloved father worked so hard for.

315,Panterken,Quite simply the best epic movie ever made !,10,14 October 2007,"After my recent re-viewing of the film, I felt obliged to leave a comment. Gladiator is the epic that makes all other epics look bad, it's flawless in almost every way. The music is more than top notch: Hans Zimmer has written his best score in years, the locations are astonishingly beautiful, the colors used are very well chosen and add to the certain atmosphere the movie has, the acting is brilliant: there are three Oscar-worthy performances here (Djimon Hounsou, Joaquin Phoenix, Russell Crowe)...all the elements come together just right and that's really so unique that it's a thrill to watch.There are two things that completely make or break a movie for me: the beginning and the end. A movie can be brilliant up until the end but if that last scene disappoints, I leave the movie theater with a bad aftertaste. Luckily, in Gladiator, the ending is brilliantly haunting, which adds so much to the movie. The music accompanying the scene is one of the best fitting scene-music pieces ever. It's just indescribable.While some may argue that it doesn't deserve all the praise it's getting because it's 'just an action-movie', I feel that it's so much more than that: the dialog is great, the acting likewise, and while the movie may have a large number of action-sequences, that's not what it's really about. It's a tale of a person, a very real person, which is a truly remarkable one.After recently seeing Troy, 300 and Alexander, I'm convinced now more than ever, that Gladiator will be the best epic ever made for years to come ( even despite the growth in technical ability over the last few years). It's always been on my best-of list and that's not likely going to change soon. If I could give more than 10, I would, but since I can't...:-)10/10",Gladiator

317,vasco_cid,Academy was right!,10,18 September 2001,"-The Best: Russell Crowe, Connie Nielsen, the evil River Phoenix, the directing, plot, music, cinematography, the outstanding battle scenes which lead this film to be one of the best of all time. Synopsis: the whole movie. -The Worst:????????????????? -Rating: 9/10Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe) is chosen to be the new emperor of Rome after Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) instead of his son Commodus (River Phoenix), which becomes a corrupt prince by killing his father and claiming himself has the new emperor of Rome. As soon as Commodus has his hands on the power he orders the army to kill General Maximus and his family. It happens that Maximus survives the attack, but not does the family that is burned and crucified alive. Maximus is found unconscious on the ground by a group of nomads who turn himself in a gladiator called Spaniard specially known for his combat skills and are these very skills that take him to Rome to fight in the Colosseum as a Gladiator. Also in Rome Maximus calls everyone's attention once more by his combat skills which  moves the emperor to know who that Spaniard Gladiator is. It is in this moment that appears one of the movie's best lines:  My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius, commander of the armies of the north, general of the Felix legions, loyal to the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and now I will have my vengeance, in this life or in the next.'. Commodus is now frightened to see that his control of the empire is dropping and the people's love for him is each time dropping as well arranges some plan to make the new hero of Rome be forgotten in less than nothingOnce more, revealing the rest of the movie's plot would certainly be really boring and somehow useless because there's almost no one who haven't seen this masterpiece already. Regarding to the movie's evident quality there aren't needed anymore words uttered by another viewer like me, as this year's Oscar nominations speak for themselves. Start running to the Oscar ceremony as the clear favourite, Gladiator's final number of Oscars ended up being somewhat like a big disappointment (there were only five). However the awards delivered to the movie were all fair besides the Visual Effects one. I can tell that I am one of the biggest defenders of this movie, but if the recreation of one big city would have been done in some other movie it would certainly be forgotten or ignored by the academy to the nominations list, in my opinion what led to the big astonishment regarding to this effects was the fact that no one have seen the city of Rome in good old times of the empire so fully created before. It is clear to everyone's eyes that the Special Visual Effects are quite more flawless and astonishing in one of the other nominees Hollow Man. Due to it's acceptance to the big audience it is now a matter of opinion but you can't surely disagree that the effects were eye candy and all the work developed by the computer wise men should have been rewarded by the Academy (see for example the scene were Kevin Bacon disappears, only that about- five minutes scene will show all of you how right I am). Regarding to the other Oscars unfortunately Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon stole almost all the awards that should have been given to Gladiator. It seems that critics and now the Academy are completely going nuts by those poor Tiger and Dragon that don't even appear on the movie But now getting back to the centre of the arena where movies like this one are considered minor when compared to movies that show a cheesy and ordinary love story that should have been water down along with the boat, we have to consider ourselves' lucky to have (only) five Oscars when we should have had 11 (Special Effects out  explained before-) Well, right now when there is lesser space for writing, before I will go back to my resting place, I should (of Course) congratulate all the ones that were responsible of bringing back Roman empire: Ridley Scott's aggressive and reachable vision, Russell Crowe's power which was capable of filling even more the Coliseum, an other powerful artist named Connie Nielsen, who by one single look meaned not what a thousand words could. See it, enjoy it, it might be tragic and get 5 Oscars instead of  11, but at least it is not tragic, ridiculous winning 11 Oscars when it should have been 5.Strength and Honour 9 out of 10.",Gladiator

Where are the shades of grey? those mysterious characters that elevate drama to the next stage.I would call this an average movie that has been over-rated because of the mediocrity that it surrounded itself with. Instead of Aussie Russell Crowe, watch his fellow A Mel Gibson in the classic ""Braveheart"" for a truly complex and heart-rending epic.An average 5 (mostly for the music and technical wizardy)",Gladiator

323,athena24,don't deserve the credit it got.,5,19 August 2005,"When I saw the movie in the theater for the first time I said it was OK. Not a great movie but worth seeing. Of course this is mainly for the battles that are amazing. And the score to the movie is fair enough. But I had a feeling that there is something wrong with this movie. It seemed that this is a replica of Braveheart. Only in Braveheart I got emotional without wanting it and in Gladiator I wanted to but I couldn't, It just wasn't so. The next time I saw it on DVD I noticed that each time I waited for the fights, because everything else is dumb. The plot unveils in turtle pace, the dialogs are over dramatic, it just like all the characters will burst with tears in minute after they say something. The most annoying thing is the plot itself. The characters look very unrealistic and unconvincing, a lot of time is wasted on unnecessary talk and the end can be predicted from the beginning.Well, a little bit of history for the end. There was an Emperor Marcus Aurelius that was considered as a ""good"" emperor, that ended the era of ""the five good emperors"". His son that succeeded him was Commodus ( just like in the movie ), but he's not killed his father. Marcus Aurelius died from a disease. Commodus himself was an excellent fighter. He fought with his father in the north, and after he became an emperor he tested himself each time in the coliseum arena with the gladiators and the beasts, and won each and every battle. Commodus killed by an athlete called Narcissus in his bath. Commodus considered himself a god and wanted people to think of him the same which can be viewed as insanity but for sure he wasn't weak and Coward as he was portrayed in the movie. He also ruled for 12 years, something that the movie doesn't count for.One commercial movie for Ridley Scott, but definitely one of the dumbest he made ( there is always G.I.Jane for this title ). Go see Alexander. Much closer to history, much better movie.",Gladiator
324,jaredpahl,"Both Old-Fashioned And Modern, Gladiator Is An Intoxicating Blend Of Action Spectacle and Intimate Drama",9,9 July 2017,"Gladiator, 2000's Best Picture winner, was undoubtedly one of the biggest successes of the decade. It made tons of box-office cash, nearly swept the Oscars, and revitalized the sword-and-sandals genre for years to come. Does the movie warrant the massive success it received? For the most part, yes. Ridley Scott's Roman blockbuster doesn't have quite the overwhelming emotion of another Oscar-winning epic, Braveheart, but as a brawny action spectacle, Gladiator soars. With a strong story, a profound sense of character, and action and special effects that are suitably exciting, Gladiator is a special kind of sword-and-sandals picture; One with a true dramatic core.Like the great epics of Hollywood's past, Gladiator is simple in its story. Russell Crowe stars as the Roman General, Maximus, whose life is thrown into chaos after the jealous Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) arranges for his execution. Maximus is sold into slavery where he meets Proximo, a former gladiator played by Oliver Reed who shepherds him through life as a gladiator as Commodus scrambles to stop Maximus' influence among the people. The story of Gladiator is a rock-solid tale of revenge, bolstered by well written characters, some sly political subtext, and a couple of stellar performances from Crowe and Phoenix. The two principle characters, Maximus and Commodus, are what separates Gladiator from the slew of sword-and-sandals epics that came after it. They are simply but elegantly written as characters; Maximus, a man singularly driven by a need to return to his family, Commodus, a confused young man singularly driven by a need to be loved. However, it is the performances from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix that really elevate this material. Phoenix gives a brilliant portrait of an emotionally frustrated young man. He is completely unpredictable, but he never becomes campy. He is a real person with real problems, and there is an underlying sadness to his character that makes him so much more interesting than your typical stock villain. As for Crowe, his performance is all about physical presence. Apart from a few big emotional scenes, Crowe's performance is one of quiet masculine stoicism. He adds a remarkable gravitas to this character that all but makes the movie. You feel for him, you relate to him, you root for him, and you become inspired by him. It is a perfect heroic performance. The character stuff in Gladiator really works. Coming from a genre that made do with archetypal characters doing obligatory British accents for years, it is nothing short of a revelation that Gladiator is such a fulfilling dramatic experience. Here are characters you actually care about and not simply placeholders to string up the plot in between action scenes.When it comes to general filmmaking, Gladiator is rarely pedestrian and often astounding. Apart from some strange quirks in the filmmaking like the seemingly digitized zooms or the moments when the frame rate seems to cause a weird flicker effect, Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. Hollywood production values don't get much higher than this. The technical departments are tops in terms of production design and costuming. The movie looks expensive, but there is something else in Gladiator's visual style that keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The look of the film, with its mix of traditional, large- scale sets and CG enhancements, is almost dreamlike. The environments of Ridley Scott's version of ancient Rome, including a painstakingly crafted digital recreation of the famous Colosseum, seem untethered to any kind of physical reality. It's as if what Scott has created is an environment that reflects the feeling of Ancient Rome rather than the reality of it. Just as with the deep characters and eloquent script, there's a modern feeling to Ridley Scott's filmmaking in Gladiator. The reliance on CGI is sometimes overdone, but in conjunction with the costumes, sets, and impressively grandiose score from Hans Zimmer, it adds to the intoxicating atmosphere of Ridley Scott's world.The main attraction of Gladiator is its scenes of gladiatorial combat, and on that front, Ridley Scott aptly gets the job done. There are a few moments when Scott falls back on to standard sword clashing and disorientating shaky cam, but for the most part, the action scenes are exciting, bloody, and imaginatively staged. The best action scenes are the opening Barbarian battle and a fantastic fight scene between Maximus, a veteran gladiator, and a Colosseum full of bloodthirsty tigers. In those scenes, Scott's emphasis on close-up, sweaty, brutal action is totally effective. I felt the cold of the forest mud, the heat of the flaming trees, the sharpness of the swords, and the dusty claustrophobia of the Arena. The action of Gladiator is visceral and bloody, and there is plenty of it. Those hungry for bloodsport will find more than enough manly derring-do to satiate their red-blooded desire.For all its dramatic depth, I can't say I came out of Gladiator heavily affected by feeling. This is still, at its core, a visceral experience, but the small character moments and the textured performances are miraculously riveting. I was intrigued by every second of Gladiator. The action scenes are thrilling, the dramatic scenes are mesmerizing, and the $103 million budget is all up there on the screen in every frame. Ridley Scott's direction is superlative, especially in the third act, as the story, action, and emotions reach a fever pitch. The last few scenes, including the climactic final showdown and the closing 'Elysium' scene, exhibit a crescendo of the kind of daring artistry that permeates the film's best sections. Gladiator is a meaty Hollywood epic of the best kind. It's visually sumptuous and supremely thrilling, but there is a beating heart within this beast. Sure there are a couple of bumps along the way, but with Crowe as the sturdy hero and a simple story of returning home, Gladiator stays with you long after the credits roll.92/100",Gladiator
325,hbs,very long epic with modern sensibilities,6,15 May 2000,"I'm surprised that people liked this so much. It was entertaining, but I've seen several movies I thought were better already this year. I found the mismatch between the ""realism"" of the sets/props/action and the modern sensibilities expressed by the actors to be somewhat jarring. And while I enjoyed the spectacle, the attempt at being serious (which included jerky camera movements and washed out colors) got in the way of that, too. (This is in contrast to Ben-Hur, which is all spectacle.) I thought that the performances were rather good (Crowe was, as always, excellent), but Derek Jacobi was acting in the wrong movie (I think that he thought he was in Spartacus, perhaps), but somehow it all added up to less than the sum of its parts for me.",Gladiator

There are a few good things about this movie, Russel Crowe's performance is good and I liked the look of the film. My biggest complaint about this movie is that I kept waiting for something to happen that never did.",Gladiator
327,pekinman,Historically inaccurate but entertaining,5,10 December 2004,"This Roman extravaganza is fun to watch but bowderlized in typical ""Hollywood"" fashion. The final scene in the Roman Coliseum is ridiculous and descends to the level of a Cecil B. De Mille circus. Aside from that the story is entertaining and the acting, generally, very good. Russell Crowe began his international film career with this movie and has gone from strength to strength in subsequent roles. An amazingly versatile actor, he holds the film together. The other strong performance is from the stunning looking Connie Nielsen's Lucilla, she is pure eye-candy. The two of them just about manage to blot out the miscast Joaquin Phoenix.Bit parts are cast from the usual suspects; Derek Jacobi's predictable performance as the ersatz I Claudius senator and Oliver Reed's slovenly and decadent Proximo. Worth a look-see but I got rid of the VHS I bought. The distortions of the truth about Emperor Comodus are just too much for this film to be taken seriously as an historical drama. It's blood and guts fantasy, nothing more.The technical aspects are excellent.",Gladiator
328,Blade_Le_Flambeur,Epic Adventure,8,22 May 2003,"Ridley Scott is a trustworthy director, and even though a couple of his movies (Hannibal, Black Hawk Down) aren't as great as his older ones (Alien, Blade Runner) he still manages to at least direct them good. Here, he takes the more Hollywood type of approach and uses camera style previously used in the 1998 feature Saving Private Ryan. What Ridley Scott understands is that to see the action, one must be in the action. He uses his this technique in Black Hawk Down with his rapid- fire photography of the battle scenes. In Blade Runner, the camera was constantly focused near Deckard. He carefully chooses his shots here and instead of just saying ""Okay, let's make it realistic"" he choses to be more detailed and shows beauty in the scenes. He should have won Best Director instead of Steven Sodernbergh. Unfortunately, John Logan and co's script ends up being mediocore at best. They are trying to dazzle the audience with a magnificent feast of old proverbs and tight dialouge, but it ends up being the typical cliche type of dialouge. Maximus is the hero, yes, but the writers smolder it in our faces showing how he can just take anyone on and still hold out well. The performances are first- rate, and even though Russell Crowe's performance was powerful it was not as good as his ""The Insider"" of which he truly should have won for. Did he deserve at least a nomination? Yes he did. In support is the always energetic and young Joaquien Phoneix as the deceptive and brutal son of the Emperor, who always seems to have a few tricks up his sleeve. His performances blends craftiness and muscular strength in a beautiful tense and even if his character is a bit cliche it's not noticeable. He should have beat out Benicio Del Toro. Also in the backround is Richard Harris as the wise and friendly Emperor Commodus who wishes for war to end. His performance masterfully builds off himself and his character, and he at least deserved to be nominated for Best Supporting Actor. As Commodus's daughter, Connie Nielsen provides most of the emotional work but she's harldy in the movie. There are some masterful shots here of the towering (CGI) arenas and the interesting costume designs to build upon everything. Even if the script isn't too good, the rest of the movie adds up enough to be a somewhat enjoyable experience and still one of the best movies of 2000. 8.5/10",Gladiator
329,basilisksamuk,"Good, but not for the expected reasons",7,1 March 2013,"If you look on my top shelf of DVDs and Blu-Rays you will find pride of place given to ""Spartacus"", ""Ben Hur"" and ""El Cid"". I have told the story elsewhere about how bizarre English educational policies permanently altered my brain chemistry so that I became fetishistically fixated on sword and sandal epics and how death by being disembowelled by the sword became linked with stories of baby Jesus in a satanic miasma of adolescent confusion. In short, I like a good epic. I had therefore been looking forward to seeing ""Gladiator"" ever since I first heard about it. The question is, then, was it worth the wait? Short answer – no. Long answer follows.I liked Gladiator a lot though it took me half the film to readjust my head to what I was seeing as opposed to what I had expected to see. I would not call this film an epic and it certainly does not compare to the spectacles we used to see in the good old epics as mentioned above. Instead we get a classic Joseph Campbell-like heroes journey story in which Russell Crowe starts out holding high position as a commander of the Roman Army in the North but is betrayed, left for dead and has to fight his way back from the bottom in order to wreak the revenge of the righteous man. On this level it works superbly. Russell Crowe is the man. There can be no doubt after seeing this film that the mantle of romantic tough guy lead must pass to him for the foreseeable future. I would not say that he is a great actor (thank god) but he has the looks and the presence to make the character work. A pivotal scene in which he reveals his identity to Commodus, his nemesis, is simply fantastic.So we end up with a film that has a very strong emotional centre. The murdered emperor Marcus Aurelius is a highly moral man who wants to pass responsibility to Crowe, not to his real son. We see the struggles that Crowe has to go through to accept the responsibility and then how, even when he becomes a slave and his family is murdered, he can still eventually do the right thing. I would guess that it is because this emotional tale is so central, rather than the fighting, that Scott has chosen to shoot so many scenes by using close-ups of the actors and that they occupy so much time on screen. In fact I think this will transfer very badly to a pan and scan TV version because he often uses close-ups with 2 heads either side of the screen with an out-of-focus centre. Nice to see a director really directing for widescreen (at least on this level).But as for the much-touted gladiatorial scenes I have to say that I was disappointed. In the first instance the CGI is still not up to the job. We all know only a portion of the Coliseum set actually existed and the rest was computer generated. It's good but it's still not good enough. The flyover shot of the arena which has been much talked about is also good but still not good enough to make you forget you are watching a computer-generated scene in which the movements of people and animals is still too jerky to be convincing. Compared to the epics of the 50s these modern CGI scenes are not as impressive as large-scale sets.I have to report disappointment over the actual combat too. Compare the opening, admittedly very good, battle with any battle scene from Braveheart and you will see that it is not quite as good. The man to man fighting between gladiators later in the film is even more disappointing with Scott constantly going for close-ups rather than pulling back to let us really see the action. Bruce Lee and Fred Astaire both looked brilliant because they were usually (almost always with Astaire) shot with their full bodies in frame. What made them so impressive was that you could see they used their whole bodies and most of what they were doing was not faked. In Gladiator I seldom escaped the frustrating feeling that tight camera angles were being used to compensate for the fact that the real spectacle was too difficult to depict. Oh and I have to say that men wrestling stuffed animals still looks as silly as it ever did.I regret saying so many negative things here but I say them because the film seems to have been hyped as something it is not. It is superficially an epic but it in no way compares to the best of the original epics. In my judgement this is a film about character and the relationships between men of honour and men of opportunity. The acting from Richard Harris is as impressive as that from Crowe. Oliver Reed also turns in a good performance for his last film and we can only regret that he did not get better roles in his life. Perhaps Reed's tragedy was that he would have been perfect for epic roles as a young man but epics had become too expensive to make by then.Ridley Scott is still, to my mind, one of the best and most innovative directors around and I rate this film highly despite my criticisms. The problem lies in the marketing. This is an excellent film but for every reason other than the ones advertised.",Gladiator
330,GMJames,An ambitious failure,5,7 March 2001,"While watching ""Gladiator"", I was reminded of a number of films with either a similar setting (""Ben Hur"", ""El Cid"") or a similar storyline (avenge your family's murder like ""The Outlaw Josey Wales"", or gather a large group of people to fight against a oppressive leadership like ""Braveheart"").Despite the film's budget and some of director Ridley Scott's impressive visuals, ""Gladiator"" left me cold. The movie didn't blow me away. Throughout the movie, I was reminded of films that did a better job. ""Gladiator"" felt very drab and, in some stretches, dull.I've been impressed with Russell Crowe's work in a number of movies including ""Romper Stomper"", ""L.A. Confidential"" and especially, ""The Insider"". I was not impressed with his work in this movie. I thought that he captured the physical aspects but not the emotional. I was surprised how much I didn't care about his character.I thought Joaquin Phoenix did a better job as Commodus. His callous, cold-blooded actions were right on target. I did find it interesting that Derek Jacobi, who played Gracchus, played a similar character in the title role of ""I, Claudius"" several decades ago.Considering all the battles that occurred in the film, I was pleasantly surprised to see that Oliver Reed gave his most understated performance in the final movie of his career.As always, with any Ridley Scott film, the visuals will always be impressive.

One as brave, noble and honorable as a man can be and the other as cowardly, wicked and evil as a man can be. Reed, Richard, Djimon, and Connie also perform well in their roles. The battles are truly spectacular. Crowe delivers one of the greatest lines in movie history when everyone realizes who he is. Fantastic story with many stirring speeches. Perfect directing by Scott.

This scene should have been the highlight of the film, but it is hard to tell what is going on.The rest of the film really loses direction, like it can't decide whether to be political or revenge-based. Why does everyone want Commodus dead? In what way is he running a 'dictatorship'? This may have been explained but the movie is far too short. Apart from Commodus, all of the characters are 1-dimensional and tiresome. There are a few good fight scenes but they don't really fit into the story.

333,SeminolePhenom,An epic masterpiece. One of the greatest films of all time...,10,10 December 2005,"An aging Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) has decided not to leave the empire of Rome in the hands to his only son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and instead has decided to leave it to Rome's greatest General and his greatest friend Maximus (Russell Crowe). Forced to make a decision by morning, Maximus sleeps on the idea while Marcus Aurelius breaks the news to his son who does not take it well and kills his father in his anger.Maximus wakes up in the morning to hearing the news of the Emperor's death, the only one knowing who the true successor was supposed to be and with an accurate assumption of who killed the Emperor. Refusing to pledge his allegiance to Commodus, Maximus is sentenced to death and escapes and journeys to save his family, only to find them all dead. With nothing left to loose, he lives his new life as a gladiator called The Spaniard, taking his vengeance on other gladiators.This is one of the greatest epic stories told on film. The idea of a man with nothing to loose has intrigued audiences for years but not since Russell Crowe have they witnessed the barbaric violence of a roman gladiator. Crowe plays the greatest gladiator I could have ever imagined and Joaquin Phoenix is one the greatest, most complicated villain ever shown on film.The action is incredible. Not since Braveheart, has there been such wonderful battles and fight sequences. From beheadings to throat slits, Gladiator does not hesitate to show the gory realism of the roman Coliseum. Breathtaking surroundings bring Rome to life though eloquent displays of architecture and the large quantities of people, quenching their thirst for the mindless violence shown in the roman arena. This as well as the wonderful writing and incredible acting bring Rome to life as well as creating a story that could entertain anyone.Gladiator is so inspiring and entertaining that I could watch it daily and still find myself still feeling as strongly as I feel about it now. The film is flawless in every aspect. Ridley Scott makes his greatest film of all time, surpassing Blade Runner and Alien. Overall, Gladiator succeeds in every aspect and is one of the greatest films of all time.",Gladiator
334,jackjack-2,"Overhyped movie, entertaining but mostly fiction",5,3 June 2001,"Many critics blasted this film yet Hollywood fell in love it. Because of the critics I did not watch it until it was shown on HBO. I was appalled with its historical inaccuracy.Basically, Russell Crowe plays the role of a General in the Roman Army under the Roman Emperor Ceaser Marcus Aurelius, who many historians consider as one of the greatest Roman emperors. Marcus died while in Germany in 180 AD. His son, Commodus became the full emperor and made peace with the Germans.
It is at this point that the movie departs from history. In the movie, just befor Marcus Aurelius died he was going to appoint his successor. The fact is that he appointed Commodus co-emperor in 177 AD, three years before he died.The movie makes the point that Marcus Aurelius had no confidence that his son was suitable to be emperor. That much is true and the movie asserts that he tried to appoint someone else to succeed him. That is untrue. If he considered Commodus unfit to rule, why did he make him co-ruler? Because if he hadn't, under Roman custom, his son had to die if he was not made the successor.The story gets more bizarre as it goes on. Russell Crowe escapes execution by Commodus and his family is slain by Commodus, who does not know that Crowe is not dead. As cruel as Commodus is, it is unlikely he would have killed the family of Crowe. It would have served no purpose. In the process Crowe becomes a slave gladiator and winds up in Rome fighting as a gladiator before Commodus. So highly unlikely.I won't give you the ending but it is pure fiction. However, I will tell you what really happened. In 182 Commodus' sister Lucilla conspired with a group of senators to assassinate him. The plot failed, and Commodus retaliated by executing a number of leading senators. Thereafter, his rule became increasingly arbitrary and vicious. In 186 he had his chief minister executed in order to appease the army; three years later he allowed the minister's successor to be killed by a rioting crowd. Political influence then passed to the emperor's mistress and two advisers.Meanwhile, Commodus was lapsing into insanity. He gave Rome a new name, Colonia Commodiana (Colony of Commodus), and imagined that he was the god Hercules, entering the arena to fight as a gladiator or to kill lions with bow and arrow. Finally, when Commodus announced that he would assume the consulship on Jan. 1, 193, dressed as a gladiator, the public became incensed. On Dec. 31, 192, his advisers had him strangled by a champion wrestler.",Gladiator

I'm not very keen to the history of the film, which might put my opinion of the film into a different context than that of a person who knows where, when, and what happened at the specific day and age this movie takes place.The acting is all well done. No one is wooden or stale, and Russell Crowe is absolutely flabbergasting as Maximus. Phoenix is superb as Commodus, and Oliver Reed does a marvelous job as Proximo. Richard Harris' few moments of screen time are very good, and Djimon Hounsou is excellent as Juba.The writing and direction is spot on. This is one of Ridley Scott's better films, and David Franzoni's script is beautifully written, despite the reported inaccuracies.Hans Zimmer's score is also the best of the year. Deep and moving, the score is gorgeous from its more subtle tracks, to its absolute bombast and explosive moments.The special effects used to create a thriving Rome are remarkable. Very realistic and adds to the epic scale of the film. The action is great too, though the camera angles and editing is a bit muddled, and it tends to get difficult at times in which the audience is trying to judge what is happening to who. The visual style of the film can get disorienting -- which is a positive and negative critique -- as some of the scenes are shot with shaky-cam moves.Overall, Gladiator is one of the best sword-and-sandal epics of all time, and definitely the best film of 2000.

340,blackburnj-1,"Breathtaking, entertaining and brilliant",10,9 July 2009,"Ridley Scott was drawn to direct this project by a painting entitled ""Thumbs down"", which depicted a scene (seen a few times in the film) where a gladiator is sentenced to death by the emperor. It is a moment of pure theatre and that is part of the cinematic appeal of the idea of Rome – an idea which had for forty years or so been ignored. Scott's resulting vision was an epic which has been one of the most influential films of the decade.The story is epic in scope, but powerful in its detail. Maximus, general of the armies of the north, is favoured by the Emperor to become the protector of Rome. The Emperor's son, Commodus, kills his father before this happens and condemns Maximus to death. Maximus escapes execution and flees to his home where he finds his wife and child murdered. He is caught by slave traders and becomes a popular gladiator intent on revenge. The work on the script should not be underestimated as this is an effective story of a man trying to avenge his family and, on some level, get home.Maximus sees Russell Crowe in one of his finest performances. He brings charisma and magnetism to the screen which makes Maximus sympathetic and engaging for both genders: a proper, fully developed character and not just an action hero to be adored by teenage boys. Joaquin Phoenix was underrated as Commodus, bringing to bear insecurity and weakness with a terrifying edge, making him one of the greatest villains of recent years. Richard Harris's appearance is all too brief in this film but is memorable enough to be counted as his last great performance. Oliver Reed meets Crowe's performance stroke for stroke and is a great presence in this film (his performance became noted for being completed with the aid of CGI after his death toward the end of filming).Scott, however, is the real star of this film, making a world as rich and detailed as the one he created in ""Blade Runner"" and delivering a terrific story masterfully. The film looks stunning and has a fine Hans Zimmer score. Once again, the computer effects were another step forward (the Coliseum was largely created by visual effects) and have not dated much in nearly ten years.The film's influence cannot be denied (wheat is now a staple image of otherworldliness) and the decade that has followed has been stuffed with historical epics (""Troy"", ""Alexander"", ""300""), none of which have been as successful or as effective. Its claim to greatness however comes from its ability to satisfy those who had come for story and character and those who came for action and excitement. It is the ultimate blockbuster.",Gladiator
341,rmarkd,... sound and fury signifying nothing,7,29 November 2000,"Nice visuals and a feel of an epic isn't enough to un-lameify this movie. What the hell is it about? Some guy who kicks ass as a general kicks ass as a gladiator until he kicks supreme ass. Big deal. Where's the story? What's the story? Sure, there's that little blurb about his wife and child, but there was no emotion in it.This movie was a lame, lame knockoff of a much better Braveheart.",Gladiator
342,rmarkd,What the hell was so great about this movie?,7,22 March 2001,"First of all, I'll give you that the movie was visually spectacular. Yeah, great visuals, great CGI. I'll even give you that Crowe and Phoenix acted well in the movie. I didn't think it was anything special, but fine, I'll give you that. But what the hell was the movie about? Basically, the tagline ""he kills and kills until he kills no more"" applies to this movie. But it had no meaning. So what if his family was killed. Did anyone feel the pain outside of those stupid dream clips which is basically Ridley Scott's futile attempt to make you think about it? These characters were two dimensional. Maximus was the low-key uber-fighter. Phoenix's character was the ultimate evil. There was absolutely no story outside of who is Maximus going to fight next. Pro-wrestling offers more of a storyline.Hey, this was a good action flick, I'd even say a great action flick. But that's all it was. This movie, IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER (IMO), separated itself from any other action flick outside of the level of visual detail and perhaps superior acting. What bothers me is that this movie will probably beat out much better movies like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Traffic, and Wonderboys for best movie of 2000, according to the ""experts"" at the Oscars. History will look back on this as a mistake. Good movie, yes. Oscar winner? No, not even Oscar nominee. 7/10.",Gladiator
343,tomrito,Ridley Scott does it again.,10,5 May 2000,"Ridley Scott has become my favorite movie maker. Once again he has taken me to another time and another place. Although this movie does not have the soul of Blade Runner or the suspense of Alien, it is a visual masterpiece. For over two hours I was transported into the ancient world. What makes this movie great is the acting and the world according to Scott. The acting of the film veterans is just great and it holds this whole movie together. Then you have Russell Crowe who is again a presence that grabs you every time you see him. I would have followed him into battle and died for him. Bottom line is, really really great entertainment.",Gladiator
344,rebecca-ry,Sets an example for future films,10,11 February 2012,"'Gladiator' is one of those films that everyone should watch at least once. I would highly recommend it for anyone to watch simply because it does everything a good film should do:The acting is for the most part excellent, particularly Joaquin Phoenix's role as Commodus where he becomes more and more creepy as the film goes on. Even Russell Crowe performs well in this film despite being a bit over-the-top in some scenes. The supporting actors of this film all perform well and there is no one in this film who lets it down.The scenery and set designs all work well too, despite the CGI Colosseum being over-sized, the interior sets are beautiful.The music is the main aspect of this film which is truly brilliant. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard did an excellent job with this film's soundtrack, especially the track at the end of the film. This film is also shot beautifully by Ridley Scott, with the slow motion sequences at the beginning in the battle against Germania being a good example but also the tiny slow motion shots of Commodus, revealing his evil character. The story is overall very good, there are no points in the film where you are left confused and there are not loose ends.Overall, I can see why this won Best Picture at the Oscars in 2000. It brings out emotion in viewers throughout its entirety and its tearful end will stay with you for a long time.",Gladiator

The movie kind of falls, at least for me, when the film try's to be moving and heartfelt, luckily those moments aren't too frequent and as I said the action manages to remain interesting throughout. The cinematography is pretty good and I really liked Joaquin Phoenix's performance as the pathetic, childish villain, Russel Crowe also gets a good performance in too. The sound design was slightly cheesy towards the end and I thought that family aspect, without getting into spoilers, wasn't given enough time to make me really care about it. Still a fun viewing experience with some really memorable moments.",Gladiator
346,pzanardo,Uglier than any pessimist could expect,1,23 January 2002,"Let's forget ""Gladiator"" won the Oscar for the best film: even worse things may happen. As a matter of fact, the movie contains uncountable mistakes and flaws on Roman history and ancient life in general. Some examples follow.
The gladiators were almost NEVER killed in the arena. That's clear: they were too important for the show business, and it costed too much money to train a gladiator to have him murdered. Their fights followed strict rules, nothing to do with the absurd slaughters shown in the movie.
A Roman Citizen by no means could be made slave, as it happens to Maximus in the movie. If sentenced by the Emperor, he could be killed by anybody, but neither made slave nor tortured. That's the reason why Saint Paul was be-headed and not crucified. And the fact that Maximus uses his long sword (Romans had no long swords) with two hands in a Samurai-like style is just too ridiculous to deserve comments.The Roman army in battle followed a scientific strategy, with tight lines of troops protected by their shields, an established sequence of attacks and retreats, and so on. The battle at the beginning of the movie is an over-confused, poorly photographed brawl. The camp of the Roman Legion was a perfect square, with a strong palisade, and the tents of all ranks were neatly divided inside it. Nothing to do with the messy camping in the forest shown in the film.""Gladiator"" won an Oscar for the best costumes, too. Well, I think that Oakland Raiders fans wear nicer and more realistic costumes. In particular, the armours and weapons in the movie are unbelievably mistaken: most of them first appeared some 800 years later than the epoch of the story.But let's forget about Roman History, and say that ""Gladiator"" is either fantasy, or science-fiction, or something like that. Nonetheless, it remains a very ugly movie. The story is boring and utterly predictable. For instance, the whole episode of Maximus' attempted escape can be fore-seen almost second by second. Maximus returns home and finds his house wasted and his family destroyed... a strikingly original idea... perhaps already seen in dozens of western movies! By the way, Maximus goes from Germany to southern Spain (say 1500 miles?), pursued, with no food. How long did this pleasant journey last? Two months? And what about the gangrenous wound, later healed by a fellow gladiator? Come on! And the repeated wanna-be-touching oneiric scene with the hand and the wheat is clumsy and far-fetched.The action scenes are confused and badly filmed. The violence is so excessive to become ridiculous. The script is awful. The cinematography is generally very poor. Large use of close-ups like in a TV-movie, extremely brief choral scenes. Why? Perhaps in order that the viewer doesn't notice the computer tricks? The fight which closes the movie is by far less spectacular than all other arena scenes: I think this is an enormous mistake for an action flick. Something to save in ""Gladiator""? The bucks it has made.",Gladiator
347,kevin142,Tragic hero,9,20 October 2005,"The old Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius wanted to give the power to his favorite general Maximus. Due to envy, Commodus killed his father Marcus and claimed him as the lawful successor. The misfortune fell on Maximus. After he lost his family, he did not want to live anymore. However life did not go on as he wanted. He was trained as a gladiator. It mattered life and death. If you wanted to survive, you had to kill the opponent.The final duel between Maximus and Commodus was the most soul-stirring duel I ever watched. Although Maximus was a powerful general, he was a kind and generous person. It was his kindness that made him become the victim of insidious Commodus. Maybe he was just fit for leading an army.Russell Crowe convincingly played the brave general Maximus. He was deserved to win the best actor (the academy award). It was a pity that Ridley Scott did not win the best director.A movie that can push you forward. 9/10",Gladiator
348,raphaklopper,Best Roman-Empire movie since Ben-Hur and Spartacus! (Extend edition review-the true Ridley Scott masterpiece,10,15 April 2013,"Who would knew that the director of ""Alien"", ""Blade Runner"" and ""Thelma & Louise"", Ridley Scott. Would make one day a amazing Roman epic since ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Spartacus"". And speaking of the extended edition (only available on Blue-ray) could not only overcome in several details the original, but also be another masterpiece of Ridley Scott's career.The film tells the story of the Roman general, the Spanish Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe). Maximus is on a military campaign in the barbaric Germania, led by the Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), which has lasted over ten years. Aurelius sees in Maximus courage and humility, and the spirit of a true leader, as a proof the love and admiration that the Roman army has for Maximus. Aurelius and Maximus nurture a big friendship and a love of father and son, which led to Aurelius appoint Maximus to be the new leader of Rome after his death, instructing Maximus to make Rome a republic again. But Maximus hesitate just because he expects his military pantry and return to his family in Spain, but the respect he has for the Emperor is very large. Everything changes when the arrogant and envious son of Aurelius, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) kills his father and orders the execution of Maximus and his family. Maximus manages to escape and return home, where he finds his wife and children crucified beside the door. Maximus is arrested and later sold to a gladiator trainer Proximo (Oliver Reed), which later becomes the best among them, and sees a path to revenge.You could say that ""Gladiator"" is Ridley Scott's ""Braveheart"". As it is filmed in the same realistic and violent style, but (in my opinion) can be much more epic. The direction of Ridley Scott is a great help, along with a dazzling cinematography on each scene. Both in spectacular epic battles (inside and outside the visually stunning Coliseum) and the superb dialog scenes.A major problem with films like ""Spartacus"" and ""Braveheart"" was connecting the dialog with the characters, which sometimes it failed and couldn't maintain a line of fiction with true historical facts, often not loyal at all. But I think Scott knew that and hired the right screenwriter for the job, David Franzoni. The writer of ""Amistad"" along with John Logan and William Nicholson, can build a superb narrative to the film from start to finish. Achieving at the same time creating a fiction story, and be extremely loyal to historical facts of the Roman Empire.This is mostly seen in the extended version of the film. Where we have many more dialogs between the characters never getting boring for a moment. And can demonstrate accurately the Roman political system, since the massive corruption and political rivalries within the senate and also the great imperial totalitarianism with the character of Commodus. And thanks to Scott, manages to have a good level of entertainment within the amazing story.But for all become more epic and exciting, Scott asked the best author of soundtracks of this generation Hans-Zimmer to participate in this epic. And delivers a soundtrack that ranges from the thrilling and exciting to dramatic and chilling (as always done ever since).And course, no one in the cast disappoints. Joaquin Phoenix didn't won the Oscar in this movie for two reasons: 1- F#ckin Critics (as always), 2- Benicio Del Toro superb performance in ""Traffic"", 3- Blue-ray versions don't compete for the Oscars. But who shines of course is Russell Crowe, with the PERFECT performance that put him on the map.Not that the theatrical version is bad. But after watching the extended version, the original feels very incomplete. Because here it was shown the exuberant performances of all the cast; the superb direction of Ridley Scott giving spectacular and realistic epic battles; a fantastic script that while it is original, it can be historically accurate with a fantastic story of the general who became a slave, the slave that turned into a gladiator, the gladiator who defied an empire. It has a question in the film: ""Are you not entertained?"" All I have to answer is ""Yes, I 'am""! 10/10",Gladiator

Its strengths are obvious - excellent acting, including memorable performances from Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Oliver Reed, an absorbing story, superb music, and interesting photography. The latter was not to everybody's taste, nor were the scenes in Elysium, but I thought both worked rather well, lending texture to what we were watching.

The home was destroyed, his wife and children were killed, and his tragic fate as a gladiator made the Roman general Max Simmons torment. Carrying too much hatred, he relied on perseverance and faith to complete the challenge beyond himself. When a person is facing despair, the strongest desire for survival often erupts, and those who fall into the abyss for this reason are destined to be abandoned by history. Undoubtedly, the hero Max Simmons, the most perfect man I've ever seen except William Wallace in his brave heart, knocks his opponent down in adversity time and time again, just as he once fought bravely on the battlefield, He climbed from the bottom to the top.

352,DrTuvok,Not quite as good as Braveheart...,8,9 May 2021,"...though still pretty good, definitely the best non-sci-fi film of Ridley Scott's career. They opening battle is definitely awesome, Hans Zimmer's soundtrack delivers, and the (though a little cliched now) revenge story is decently engaging.BUT, Scott fails on a few points. He drags in the shaky cam in many of the gladiator scenes, which comes close to outright ruining them. There are also a couple scenes featuring some sketchy CGI, though the director can't really be blamed for this. Other than that, we are definitely entertained.(Braveheart had neither of these issues, so it gets an A+ while Gladiator just gets an A).",Gladiator
353,Captain Ed,Neither great nor bad -- good entertainment,7,27 June 2000,"This is a much quirkier film than you would expect from a gladiator epic, and it's going to disappoint some people.First off, it is NOT history, although a few historical characters are used. In the film's defense, it really doesn't try to BE history, either, merely using historical backdrops for a morality play.  Although, having said that, the opening battle use of the longbow is an anachronism, I believe; the longbow didn't come into use until the thirteenth or fourteenth century, and its origin was Welsh and English.  Minor point, but since I have castigated other movies on similar points ...The performances were outstanding, subtle, and complex, even the sometimes over-the-top performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus.  Connie Nielsen is especially effective, and for the first half of the film you're not quite sure where her character stands.  I thought Oliver Reed was breathtaking in this film.  It's the only film I've seen where I liked Reed, and what a shame he passed away during the filming.The script gets pretty conventional in the second half of the film, and therefore predictable.  However, the visual presentation is stunning, with washout coloring and inventive camera techniques.  I can understand why these might be irritating to other filmgoers, especially if they're expecting a traditional epic.  Obviously, I liked it.Overall, it's a good film, not a great one, and not one everyone will appreciate.  I think it's overall ranking is excessive, and I rated it a 7.",Gladiator

355,CurtMan@LVCM.com,"Powerful, Engaging, And Exhilarating Masterpiece",10,13 September 2004,"""Gladiator"" has some of the best elements I have ever seen in a film. This is an invigorating, passionate, potent, and beautiful production, in almost listless ways. The direction is near impeccable, chronicling a simple tale of injustice and revenge in such a powerful, under- standing, and reverent manner to both the trials and conflicts of Maximus and the oppressive, grandiose atmosphere of Ancient Rome. Russell Crowe's performance as Maximus is beyond brilliant, perfecting nearly every confliction, strength, and intensity his character possesses and experiences; his attitude is fierce, his movements suggest he is disturbed, and his actions prove he is ready to ""have his vengeance"", and Crowe provides everything he can to make Maximus one of the most compelling characters to ever grace the screen. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, Maximus's enemy and the man who has robbed him of virtually everything he once possessed, is vicious, brooding, and bitter, as he nearly perfects this antipathetic role, where we love to hate this villain, and root for Maximus to achieve his demise. Everything else, from the riveting, stirring, and flat-out indelible music, some of the most portentous and potent in film, to the dialogue between the characters, containing some of the most memorable lines (e.g. ""What we do in life echoes in eternity""), to the fast-paced, involving cinematography, to the incredible realistic look of the visual effects (One would never believe the audience in the Colosseum wasn't entirely there, or for that matter, the Colosseum!), and on and on and on. This is the quintessential revenge and Roman Empire story, executed in a near impeccable and rousing manner. A true sensation of film-making genius. **** out of ****",Gladiator
356,Embley,The first true epic in a while,9,13 May 2000,"Wow.I went into this film pretty sure I would hate it.  Wow.  I was pretty impressed.  It has been a long time since I have seen a film that had an epic feel to it in the same way that Lawrence of Arabia or Ben Hur did.. Not that it is a perfect film or anything.  It is great escapism.  Russell Crowe is fantastic - MAXIMUS.  How can you go wrong with Ancient Rome and all those great latin names?The art direction was very good - thank god they covered the actors in dirt. It always sucks to see clean and pristine 20th century actors portraying characters from the middle ages or ancient times.I thought also that this was one of the first big budget films to really pull off using some surreal effects.  Often they stick out like a sore thumb, but I felt they were very effective in this film.The only problem I had with the film I think was that when Maximus was taken to the desert and made a gladiator, the whole sequence of events was too short.  He's taken away, he is sold into gladiator slavery, he rises to the top of the gladiators, and then he is sent back to Rome to fight for the emperor.  It needed to be spread out just a little.  I know it was a long film, but another few minutes in that part of the film would have done wonders.I particularly liked the camera work during the fight sequences.  Very nice.",Gladiator
357,Keyser Soze-12,Would make William proud,9,24 September 2000,"How good is the movie Gladiator?  Let me count the ways.  One, the direction is beautiful.  Ridley Scott, who directed Blade Runner, has done an impressive job by creating a gritty dark look much like Saving Private Ryan did.  Two, the performances are great.  The characters have deep feelings and emotions, and are portrayed beautifully by a great collection of actors. Three, the script and the story sounds like Shakespeare.  While it is not, if Shakespeare were to have written a story about a gladiator, it would be this movie.    And finally, four, the action makes sense and makes you jump at the same time.  This is one of the best movies not only of the year, not only of the decade, but also of all time.Some critics have called it depressing.  Well, it is in a way.  There is little or no color to the film.  Like I said, the cinematography is similar to Saving Private Ryan.  The story is also a little depressing, but just about every story ever made is depressing if you think about it.  The ending to some people may not seem happy.  But, to those of you who have seen the film, the main character Maximus found exactly what he was looking for and wanted so bad.I'm now about to give away the story, but if you have seen the preview you know it anyway.  Russell Crowe plays as Maximus, general of Roman's army in Germania.  He is the best general in Rome's army and is admired by the emperor as a son.  But all Maximus wants is to return home to his wife and son.  The emperor's son, Comodeus, is selfish and wants the throne now before his father can hand it over to the senate.  As you guess, Comodeus kills his father and blames Maximus for the crime because of his father's love for him.  Maximus escapes only to find his wife and son have been assassinated by the new emperor.Maximus is picked up and sold as a slave where he must fight as a gladiator to win food.  Here his master learns of Maximus's tragedy and tells how he too was betrayed by the emperor.  His master takes Maximus and his other gladiator slaves to Rome to compete in the 180 days of games ceremony set up by the new Caesar.The fight scenes are quick and bloody.  Sometimes it is hard to see what is happening.  It took me a few minutes to get used to the angles and wild motions of the camera.  This is not a movie for children for the blood gets almost unbearable at times.  However, fight scenes are not what this movie is about though the trailers may deceive you.  This is a movie about redemption, revenge, war, and peace.The thing that impressed me most about Gladiator is how well it is written. The words move as smoothly as the story.  The plot reminds me of Shakespeare.  A general becomes a slave because of a jealous emperor.  The slave who became a gladiator.  A gladiator who defied that emperor.  And how that gladiator found his revenge.  The ending scene reminds me of so many Shakespeare plays its almost funny.  As much as I want to tell you about it, I won't.  This isn't as much a movie as it is an experience.  An experience that no one should miss.By the way, for all you a**holes who gripe about how films like this are unrealistic, well, that isn't why it was made.  Few movies are made to be history lessons, and when they are they suck like anything.  Realism is important, but historical accuracy is not.  This movie is made to be entertaining, and it accomplishes that like no movie I've ever seen.Even if you didn't like it, but it for the fact that it's on two discs; TWO FOR GOD's SAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Gladiator
358,CherryBlossomBoy,Victory of production over a lousy script,7,22 October 2006,"There is an unwritten rule in movie making that if you have an excellent script it doesn't matter how you film it. If you have a lousy script - then everything else matters, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music... ""Gladiator"" is an epitome of the latter half of that rule. The case where direction, music, acting and art direction completely redeemed a crappy story.For me it took watching it in German overdubbing. As I don't speak German there was nothing to detract me from visuals and music. And it's a new experience on another level. But more on that later. First the crappy part. The story.Make no mistake, whether you care about history or not, this is a horrible script. It's taking huge (and quite unacceptable) liberties with the period it purports to portray, it's unconvincing even on its own terms, the dialog is pretty much high school and in its core it's a predictable revenge story told a zillion times before. Apparently (according to a documentary about Hollywood screenwriters) only Russell Crowe didn't know what turd the script was so he contributed himself with the juvenile ""husband of the dead wife"" speech.Ridley Scott and his crew apparently knew what stinker they had to work with and did their best to defeat it with excellence in all areas and actually made two films in one.On the surface it's a revenge story. The hero, a favorite army general turned gladiator, seeks revenge against a young emperor, who had general's family killed during the tumultuous succession to the throne. The military battles and the gladiatorial bouts required for this aspect of the movie are done both to tremendous detail and on a grand scale. With the help of CGI they are seen in all their glory and gore. Some accuse Scott of shying away from action but his direction shows everything one needs to see. Yes, the cuts are brief, the camera sometimes doesn't follow through, but the editing is pure poetry and you miss nothing. Cinematography-wise every frame is shot in a way that you could just hang it on a wall as a nice picture. Costumes and scenery are impeccable. A revenge story, yes, but well worth watching.But on another level ""Gladiator"" plays out like a remake of ""Fall of a Roman Empire"". But it's not in the script. It's in the mood set again by production. This other story is about the decline and death of classical Rome and its ideals. There is simple yet effective symbolism to express it, the play on dark and light and the sunrise-sunset arc. The movie starts with a battle at dawn, the way the Rome itself had once dawned, fighting. There is an ideal Roman hero, valiant and dutiful, there's a typical Roman villain, clandestine and scheming. Hero does his best in the light, the villain does his worst in the dark, whenever they swap environments during the movie they fail miserably. The story ends at sunset, symbolizing the end of the Empire itself, and although an uplifting speech is given at that point it is defeated by the setting sun.The feeling of the doom is constantly emphasized by melancholic music. The dreamlike experience of the main character who is already dead but doesn't yet know it is enhanced when he finally visits Rome and the city is an idealistic, blown in proportions version of itself. The script may be a complete falsification of history, but the feeling of decline one gets when watching those scenes is probably completely faithful.So forget the story and the closing speech. Watch and listen the movie. The Roman Empire is living and dying once more before your very eyes.",Gladiator
359,cutter-12,Adequate Roman Epic,7,29 March 2002,"There is much to appreciate about about this picture but at the same time there is much to castigate as well. What could have been a thoroughly involving story turns out to be crippled by a lean script, some very indecisive direction and choppy editing. Not to mention some bad casting in the form of Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, a role which cries out to have been the last role played by Anthony Quinn.The film starts out well and looks bleakly authentic in its depiction of the pivotal battle in the wars between the barbarian tribes of Germania and the Roman Empire. But as the story gives way to 40 minutes of exposition following Commodus and Lucilla's introduction, Ridley Scott seems to tack things on whenever the script runs into weak spots. This leaves the film without a flowing narrative and it seems to want to please a mindless summer movie action market while at the same time aspiring to be something deeper. What it leaves us with is a schizophrenic, unequivocal story full of contradictions. There seems to be an epidemic in the past three or four years - films like this, Titanic, The Patriot, Pearl Harbor, Enemy at the Gates etc, try hard to be great epic films but at their core they are very slight and even trivial. The story in Gladiator holds promise but what little conflict there is set up and thrown at us in the first hour, leaving just a linear resolution to unfold for the remainder. A shame because so many elements could have been introduced in this story to make it truly an awesome and thoughtful epic. I guess complex stories like Spartacus and Ben-Hur will never be made again. This one falls somewhere short, though better than Demitrius and the Gladiators and the film it heavily borrows its narrative structure from - The fall of the Roman Empire.Technically the CGI is at times seamless and other times poor. When our troop of Gladiators run into the colosseum for the first time however the effect is absolutely jaw dropping and the scene that follows certainly delivers the action goods. The acting is very good throughout except for Tomas Arana as Quintus (about as bad as John Dall in Spartacus) and the aforementioned Richard Harris. Like Braveheart, not a bad entertainment experience but highly Hollywoodized and with an uneven narrative. But unlike Braveheart, the ending to Gladiator is a just a little embarrassing as it rips off both Braveheart and Titanic to far less effect. If you can get past the flaws, not the worst Roman spectacle on offer. Too highly rated at 8.1/10.",Gladiator

Why? Because I believe Gladiator is one of the greatest films ever made. As far as favorite films go, this is one of my top five. In fact, as I think about it, it rests only behind ""Evil Dead"" and ""American Beauty"" for me.Of course, who now isn't familiar with this story? The Roman Legion General Maximus, Russel Crowe, is the main figure. The film follows his journey from General to slave to gladiator. It is also the story of Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and his usurping of the throne of Emperor, as well as his knowledge of the people of Rome (the mob), and his lack of knowledge of politics. It follows the side-story of the planning to de-throne Commodus and restore the Republic that once was Rome. All with staggering sets and scenes, a rousing musical score, and a cast of believable, and realistically portrayed characters.Here's the breakdown:What's New: --17 minutes of added material, according to the DVD case.--Countless scenes have extra shots here and there basically adding to the detail of Rome, the environment and atmosphere. --Proximo (Oliver Reed), the man who first purchases Maximus to be a gladiator, is seen being enticed to bet against Maximus and Juba (Djimon Hounsou) in their first gladitorial bout when they are chained together. --Prior toanother early bout--where Maximus alone is the fighter in the arena against several other men--we see Proximo telling him to entertain the crowd. --A new conversation during the time when Maximus is scarring himself in an attempt to remove the mark of the Legion from his shoulder. --Several new scenes of a subplot concerning the poor job Commodus is doing as Emperor and what needs to be done to rid Rome of his influence. --Commodus rages against a statue of his father after finding out Maximus still lives. --An execution of those Commodus believes lied to him about the execution of Maximus. --The revelation that the extremely large gladiator, Hagen (Ralf Moeller), under Proximo is a German barbarian (which adds some depth and insight into a brief exchange between the barbarian and Maximus later on). --Little more depth added to Quintus (Tomas Arana), a member of the Pretorian Guard.The Good: --The acting is superb and believable--Russel Crowe's performance is powerful and often heart-breaking. --The sets and costumes are perfect--you believe you actually are in Rome. The colors, images, and scale are vibrant, breathtaking, and immense. --Brilliant atmosphere and cinematography. --Some of the best fight/battle sequences I've personally ever seen in a film of this nature. Sure, ""Braveheart"" chopped more limbs, but these bouts were more personal and more face-to-face. No running-through-a-field-swinging-a-blade-randomly here. --Added footage fills in many gaps. --Among the best music of any motion picture, in my very humble opinion. I can't count the times when the music and themes from this film have wandered randomly into my mind. --Some of the best dialogue and lines of any film of this nature. A far cry above the Neanderthal ramblings of Brad Pitt in ""Troy.""Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help: --The added scenes may or may not be to the flavor of some people. Personally, I really liked them and the added depth to the story and characters in the film. For me, several small gaps and conversations now make more sense. No new battle footage--that was all kept in the theatrical (also Director's) cut.--At 2 hours and 51 minutes, it may be too much for some people now--but those people don't matter.The Bad: --Not one damn thing. Although, some may be disappointed by the lack of any new battle footage.The Ugly: --Many people complained about the quality of the backgrounds behind the massive sets. Frankly, they don't bother me one bit. You know why? Because a tiny imperfection in the background image in an otherwise perfect film doesn't detract from the film's power or quality in any way.Memorable Scene: --There are far too many. But for the sake of filling this in: The first time Maximus reveals himself as still living to Commodus as well as the climactic final battle between the two. Also, Proximo's Gladiators' first great event in the Colisseum--where they won when they were supposed to lose. You see? Too many to pick just one...Acting: 10/10 Story: 10/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 10/10 (more than the R-rated version) Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 2/10 (quantity--based around Commodus's infatuation with his sister, some dialogue) Violence/Gore: 8/10 (quantity--all high quality) Sets/Backgrounds: 9/10 Dialogue: 10/10 Music: 10/10 Writing: 10/10 Direction: 10/10Cheesiness: 0/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 10/10Frankly, if you're a fan of Gladiator or even Russel Crowe, you need to get this version of the film. If you're a war/epic/battle-film fan, you'll also greatly enjoy it. Standard film buffs--see it. Standard movie goers... well if you've seen the original, and only ""liked"" it or thought it was just ""okay"" or even ""not your cup of tea,"" may find nothing new here to hold any interest. Personally, I highly recommend it, but then again, it is one of my personal favorite films.www.ResidentHazard.com",Gladiator

363,DoctorSkyTower,Excellent Film,10,3 September 2000,"Excellent fight scenes, excellent plot (wow, a film with a *real* story!) and very long (nearly 3 hours).I believe Russell Crowe was perfectly cast as Maximus. Maximus is a hero with loyalty to his country and to the old caesar, but especially to his family. He has the loyalty of his army behind him so is adored by just about everybody.Commodus, the whining, cringing, cowardly git was played well by Joaquin Phoenix. As was his sister. She came across to me as being the real emperor of Rome, while her brother was really a whimpering SOB.What beautiful scenery! Computer effects of Rome was eye candy to behold! See computer-animated tigers and blood! The fight scenes were not as gory as I expected. I have seen far worse! Some of these fight scenes, especially the ones which take place in the Colliseum in Rome, are quite spectacular. Shows how the blood thirsty citizens of ancient Rome love to be entertained... (much like todays' blood thirsty movie audiences who love to be entertained by trash like... dare I say... Hollow Man!!!)CONCLUSION: This film is a must see.",Gladiator
364,IcyTones,Halt! Who Goes There! Stand & Deliver!,10,27 November 2020,"A movie where the featured Black guy is 'NOT' the first to die. Djimon Hounsou who plays Juba is a rising star that has swapped his life as a Catwalk Model & appearing in music videos for an acting career. He has been acting since 1997.
Juba is 'The Spaniard's' confidant whilst both serve as slaves. Both were sold to the local entrepreneur to fight as Gladiators.That unmistakable scar & voice of Oliver Reed was a surprise to see as this movie was recommended to me for 'the chariot race' scene. Twas good to see a veteran actor in this movie. Oliver Reed was to acting what George Best was to football. I always think that whatever major or minor roles veteran actors play, their names should come up first in the credits, but sadly not everyone shares this view.Although it's not a competitive race, there is a small 'Chariot Race' in the Coliseum Arena, but it's a race to kill the band of Gladiators stuck in the middle, before they get a chance to kill the Emperors league of marauders - in the name of 'sport'.The Emperor's son didn't just 'decide' to kill his father, he had a heart felt emotional son-to-father talk with his dad, who responded equally with the same heartfelt emotions of a father who knelt before his son to kinda ask for his son's forgiveness. A father who now acknowledges that he is as much to blame for shaping Commodus's wayward character, is a moment to be treasured. It's the father who has failed his son, not the son who has disappointed his father. The Emperor extended his arms to give his son a hug, but his son Commodus overcome with grief and jealousy at hearing the news that his father's general has been appointed by his father to temporarily rule Rome, he took the opportunity of an embrace to suffocate & kill his father and declare himself the new Emperor.If you lack the courage to be yourself, this movie can only but encourage you. In today's society education is a supportive aid to have a title & letters after your name. When asked to reveal himself, Maximus gave this whole spiel of who he was. Who are you? What goes before you? How do you want to introduce or refer to yourself? These were my thoughts!",Gladiator
365,Michael Kenmore,The work of mediocrity,6,5 May 2000,"I was disappointed. I did not have high expectation, but I was taken in by the word of mouth that alleges Gladiator is a great epic akin to Ben-Hur. Sorry, but Gladiator fails to beat Ben-Hur by the distance. In fact, Ben-Hur is marginally better than Gladiator. There are problems with this film. The cinematography, however beautiful and majestic in some scenes, is murky and at times irritating -- especially the sped-up method used for chaotic effect that left me cold even in the midst of carnage (hasn't this been done already in Saving Private Ryan?). There's a lack of focused direction by Ridley Scott -- the result is too many scenes that droll on and on. I felt no empathy for the cast's stilted performance of the characters throughout the film. The editing is confounding in the heat of the major war battle and gladiator duels. Even a good performance by Russell Crowe can't save this film from being doomed to failure.I despise the flashbacks. It's the cliche that has been done to death. That's the most irritating part of the film besides that annoying and insipid young actress girl. Right in the beginning of the film after the prologue, with the main character's hand weaving through the wheat field, I knew Chuck Rudolph was right when he murmured: ""Malick be damned"". (For those who don't get the quote -- it's a sarcastic reference to Terrence Malick's 1978 Mid-Western classic ""Days of Heaven"")Although technically impressive, the movie fails to engage me in the story I find meandering and tedious. Though I wasn't bothered by gore, I find the audience's positive response to blood and carnage cynical and despicable, especially after the fact Dreamworks/Universal showed the TV spot comparing Gladiator-esque violence favorably to football and hockey.It's not a terrible movie, but it's certainly not great as the majority of the moviegoers seem to believe. Gladiator is as mediocre as Braveheart, and that's the only compliment I have for this film.",Gladiator

Crowe, a sort of uninteresting Richard Burton, is Shane--the little good guy who beats up and kills all the bad guys.

The political correctness is boring.Better to see The Robe, with the real Richard Burton.",Gladiator
367,InlyCii,Brave heart,8,26 April 2020,"No war, no violence, no disaster, it is destined to be an era without heroes. Watching such a film with legendary heroism in such an era is especially awe-inspiring and precious.",Gladiator
368,TheNabOwnzz,"Gigantic in scale, rich in substance & also one of the most emotionally draining movies ever made",10,21 April 2019,"Gladiator is not just director Ridley Scott's ultimate masterpiece ( And i am also keeping the fantastic Alien & Blade Runner in mind when i say this ), it is also undoubtedly one of the most viscerally effective and emotionally compelling of motion pictures ever made.It plays somewhat like a modern Ben-Hur, as a very respectable character is forced into slavery due to him standing up for what is right. Of course, being a much more modern epic, the editing is a lot quicker, as is the entire pace of the picture. However,with 171 minutes playtime in the extended edition, Scott doesn't haste through this picture, and takes his time to set up his characters & their respective arcs. Gladiator is however not a flawless film, as several action sequences ( Particularly in the introduction in the battle of Germania ) feature quite a lot of shaky cam and quick editing, but admittedly this is nowhere near as bad as something like Taken or The Bourne Trilogy. Most of the action sequences are superbly edited, with widescreen shots to create an overview, combined with mediums to immerse the viewer into the action. A couple of times there is a shakycam shot in the middle of this, but it's a very minor issue. Another minor fault is in some of the backdrops. The 'Am i not merciful' scene features an obvious greenscreen, saturated a bit too brightly, and Proximo is obviously not physically there near the end of the film ( When actor Oliver Reed had already died ). Again these minor issues feature only in 1 scene respectively, and therefore do not really do anything to truly diminish the cinematic power that Gladiator provides.On the whole, the cinematography & art direction of Gladiator is impeccable. It is not the best, since as stated before there are a couple of lesser backdrops easily recognizable as greenscreens, but for most of the picture the viewer is subjected to beautiful angles, backdrops & sets. The scenes in Zuccabar are an example of the seductive natural beauty Gladiator provides, and Maximus's ride to his family after his execution attempt also feature some stunning environmental shots. Sets are elegantly crafted and varied in a beautiful color palette, becoming most apparent in Commodus's & Lucilla's scenes. The titanic image of the Colosseum is also one that is difficult to get rid of, despite the fact that i believe it was filmed in full CGI, but apart from perhaps the absolute final shot ( Burying the sculptures ), that is hardly noticable.The art of acting is utilized at its finest in Gladiator, with three absolute superb performances by leads Russel Crowe as Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus & Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. Not to mention the fantastic supporting performances of legendary actor Richard Harris & Oliver Reed. Crowe is the epitome of a brick of stoic masculinity, yet he gave an utterly convincing and extended sob fest when gazing upon the sight of his crucified family, showing us his versatility as an actor. We see him win a battle against Germanians through his discipline, intelligence and courage, and we are rooting for his character from this moment forth. He is in his heart a simple man that just wants to go home to his family, but he is also honor bound to Rome, and proves this through his courageous actions. Not interested by the corruptions of power, he lives only to see justice done. Phoenix is superb as the corrupted emperor, showing us his envy of Maximus simply with one look into the eyes ( Look at Phoenix's superb facial acting in the scene where Maximus reveals himself to him in the arena ), his arrogance & his brutality. Nielsen is also quite underrated, as her disguised fear during every scene with her brother after their father's death is a stunning feat of acting within acting, culminating with her utter terror at the end when Commodus demands a 'pure blood' heir with her.Of course one cannot forget Hans Zimmer's fantastic contribution to his masterpiece, creating arguably his finest score to date, with this especially being the case during the transition between the (Again) 'Am i not merciful' scene and the shots of the arena. Obviously 'Now we are free' is also one of the most emotionally powerful scores ever created. It is also one of Zimmer's most varied scores, as a slight criticism of him is often his repeated melodies ( Admittedly, a lot of the themes in Gladiator still sound similar to The Rock, but a lot of them also do not ). In any case, it is rare to imagine the brilliance and emotional resonance of Gladiator without Zimmer's score.While the narrative is fairly straightforward as a revenge story, the dialogue written is superb, with many incredible lines such as 'What we do in life, echoes in eternity', not to mention the slow character development and character arcs, even within seemingly minor characters like Proximo & Quintus ( You will need to see the extended edition to witness Quintus's arc ) who have their original ideals challenged and overcome throughout the events in the film. Even though Maximus's sole purpose in life has become to kill Commodus in revenge for his family, it is in a way a very hopeful film. A film about standing up for what is right, and being granted redemption and a reunion with loved ones in the end. Maximus does not want to rule Rome, but in slaying Commodus, he secures the feature of it for is people, while also acquiring his personal goal. He demands respect for his valor and his morals throughout the film, and this makes sure that we as an audience are emotionally drained by the time he enters the Elysium fields, and is hailed as a hero by the people of Rome, and a hero he was.One of the all-time greats of epic motion pictures, Gladiator features impeccable acting, writing ,cinematography, art direction & a phenomenal original score. It also features possibly the most relatable main character ever written, which is partly why there are very little films that can equal the emotional power that Gladiator creates.",Gladiator
369,NikkoFranco,"I came, I saw , I conquered",10,31 May 2018,"Veni, Vedi, Vici- the Latin phrase translated to I came, I saw , I conquered. This is a master collaboration, between Russel Crowe (whom I have seen in other roles before and as Maximus Aurelius is supreme) , and Ridley Scott, the revolutionary Einstein of film making and the phrase comes to mind whenever I see this film. These two are the men's men and Gladiator is a movie about rising and falling and rising and falling again but with dignity and passion. Another standout is Joaquin Phoenix who played the conniving, power-hungry, incapable, brutal, unpopular emperor who killed his father for the throne and framed Maximus and killed his wife and son for it. Who will ever forget, "" And I shall have my revenge, in this life or the next "" . I disagree with some commenting that this film is testosterone packed for this is a tale as true as it can be and it's not only about the fight scenes and action but more about our own mirror of moral compass , survival, honor and love.

371,jaybizman,"Gladiator: ""Are You Not Entertained?"" - Yes!",10,11 November 2020,"Russell Crowe rightly earned an Oscar for his performance in this movie.
Joaquin Phoenix played the part of a jealous, cowardly Emperor perfectly.There are thousands of 'Reviews' on IMDB about Gladiator, so I'd like to
add a personal anecdote or two; in the first ten minutes or so there is a final battle between the might of the Roman Army and the ""Huns"" (German Tribes.)
This was the Battle of Teutenberg Forest and it was shot in a farmers field, called Bourne Woods - about two miles from where I used to live.Seems that when the producers approached the UK's Forrestry Commission for
permission to (literally) burn down the forest on the land, they were given
permission as the forest was due to be uprooted anyway. So the Commission
was happy for the movie makers to do the work for them. Amazing.Oliver Reed (RIP) was someone who used to frequent a local pub, and he would
tell tall tales to keep everyone ""entertained"" - his drinking was legendary.This movie, IMO, paved the way for others to follow: ""sword and sandals"", such
as Centurion, The Eagle, etc. and will be difficult if not impossible to beat.Another Scott helmed movie is The Kingdom of Heaven with Orlando Bloom and Eva Green. If you loved Gladiator, check this one out also.Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" - entertainment par excellence. 10/10. Easily.",Gladiator
372,thewillt08,Finally Saw This Movie,8,30 October 2013,"It took a long time but I finally saw Gladiator. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix star in a story I have seen plenty of times in movies. The story is simple. Guy in high power gets betrayed by a jealous brother and falls to the bottom and has to climb back up to gain his vengeance. How many times have I seen this? A lot. How many times does it work really well? A lot. In Gladiator it works really well. Everything from the acting to action worked in this movie.Like I said the plot is basic but it works. I have seen this movie before just with a different setting and characters. Russell Crowe is a general for the Roman Empire, Maximus, and his father who adopted him is dying wants him to take over the empire. Commodus, Phoenix, is the rightful heir to the throne because he is blood related but he takes his brother out of the picture anyway by betraying him and murdering his family. Maximus survives and becomes a Gladiator to get his revenge. I figured out the ending to this movie and most of the key plot points but it was still amazing.Russell Crowe gives an amazing performance in this movie, winning him an Oscar. Crowe has an amazing talent for acting and this was his best performance. Luckily he didn't sing. His best scene is when he finds his family dead. He has an emotional breakdown. Another when Commodus is tempting Maximus to fight and he keeps his composure. Any normal man would have broken down but he kept his cool. Maximus is a very interesting character and a natural leader. I don't know why Joaquin Phoenix's career went down the tubes but he comes through in the clutch in this movie. Commodus is one of the creepiest villains in any movie. He stalks his nephew and wants to sleep with his sister. His jealousy and anger towards Maximus drives his performance. When he is on screen its intense. His emotion escalates rather quickly. Phoenix got nominated for an Oscar and I think he deserved it. The fighting scenes in this movie were top of the line. My favorite being the one with the tigers. I saw the tiger come out and I went nuts. I was pumped and as unrealistic as it was, it was awesome. The Colosseum looked real and amazing. The lack of CGI shows and it makes the movie better. Watching this I pictured the making of the movie and the set. The sands of the Colosseum were probably real and the first section of seating was probably used with extras. The second two had to be CGI for budget common sense but the movie felt real. I watched the director's cut of this movie so it was really long. Honestly I got a little bored and most of the added in scenes I could spot out. There was a lot of filler that didn't need to be in there. I took that into account when thinking back on the movie. The regular version is probably a lot better and cleaned up but the backstory was still interesting. Character relationships are obviously very important and none was creepier than the one with Commodus and his sister. Many times in the movie he tries to kiss his sister. There comes a point where he demands she give birth to his future son. That's messed up. It shows how sick his character is. I understand power hungry but this guy was 110% crazy. Maximus is a great leader and has great relationships with his soldiers. There is the one huge guy and the other black guy he befriends and they are both incredible. Secondary characters like that are important and they do their part.Overall, Gladiator is a masterpiece and I don't know why I waited so long to see it. Hans Zimmer adds an excellent score and captures the emotional part of the movie. Ridley Scott directs this film in the right into the academy awards and he really let his stars shine. Crowe and Phoenix give it their all and help push this movie to get the WillyT Seal of Approval.",Gladiator

374,dalton2,I was disappointed,7,20 May 2000,"I heard and read that this film is a classic, and thus I expected a really great film. But it's not the case. This film has a serious lack of character development despite it lasts 2 and a half hours. Together with the character development, we can see a poor ambient development. We just see a huge coliseum and thousands of people computer-generated. Just that. We don't see closeups, we can't see the feelings involved, and we feel no empathy at all (for a good example of a well done job, see Kubrick´s Spartacus). The camera moves in the fight scenes are acceptable for films like Saving Private Ryan, set in a time where cameras did exist, but not for a Romans' film... They just seem to be used to make us more difficult to find goofs, and that is a dirty trick in a so expensive movie. Another point is the acting. The actors are not bad, but they don't look like people from the 2nd century. OK, nobody knows how they were, but I am sure they weren't like people from the 20th century. I mean, the dialogue, the way they move, the feelings they show. You can use the same acting and the same music in a film set in the Middle Ages and we wouldn't note the change. If we forget that Ridley Scott is the director and Steven Spielberg is the man behind the production company, we just have a mediocre film. I still can't believe that The Sixth Sense got no oscars and American Beauty took them all. Mr. Spielberg, you are rich enough yet, so please let talented people do their thing and stop your 'This is the greatest film ever' propaganda in a Microsoft style!

Once I read about a Jewish concentration camp prisoner who is survived fully, because he is able to free himself inside the camp. Freedom from the fear and mental tortures in which he received during his 3 years of imprisonment. Physical tortures and isolation is better compared to mental and thought imprisonment. Nelson Mandela once said 'They can kept me away, but the will not kept away my thoughts and ideas' Maximus Decimus Meridius (if I'm not mistaken), a top rate Roman general, is offered a choice between coming home to his family Spain or take another duty in Rome. He cannot say no and half heartedly decide to rule Rome and stand up for the people and the republic for the glory of the Roman Empire. A condition which was changed by the corrupt politicians and tyrants. Alas, the Empire died and replaced by his son, a disfunctional characters longing for love and acceptance from his father, the last Caesar. Maximus overuled the Caesar and deserted until he was stranded at the gladiator arena. And we are dealing with the imperfect characters; Maximus who is imprisoned by his own rage and pain towards his family, Caesar who is imprisoned by his own fear and hunger for love, his sister who is trapped in her fear and love towards his brother and son and in between good and evil. The audience was placed perfectly in the screen. From the magnificent opening, the barbarian and bloody fights in the collosseum, through many colossal acts and supportive CGI. Russel Crowe (Virtuosity, the Quick and the Dead, the Insider), the humble hero arise not because he is well built like Arnold or with Bruce Willis sinister look. It's because he is merely integrated with the casts and the atmosphere built by the talented movie crews. And so the Gladiator arise, towards the fight for the freedom. A freedom more than just physical, which asks us about how we're dealing towards our own imprisonment. Freedom from fear, hate, anything. Destined to be another Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Black Rain, Alien, Thelma & Louise) masterpiece, the movie itself speaks with the same ambience like his previous movies.

379,CinefanR,CGI Overkill,6,2 July 2012,"First of all, the CGI is terrible and mostly gratuitous. I don't see why the director couldn't shoot some REAL natural landscapes for Crowe's psychedelic flashbacks. As for Rome, it was all obviously fake, computer generated crap. Not a single sparkle of authenticity. I won't deny the utility of special effects, but I can't be alone on this one. CGI has cheapened the epic by inserting flat digital figures where beautifully three-dimensional human extras once stood, and by creating green-screen worlds that never have the depth of real locations. Watch Lawrence of Arabia"" for example and you'll feel the difference. What a sad irony that a film made 40 years prior to Gadiator"" gives class to contemporary cinema...Secondly, the action was excessively violent. I won't even discuss the historical accuracy. The only bright spots are Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, both over-the-top in a pretty entertaining way. Russell's presence is overwhelming thanks to a spectacular physique and charisma... but not even his amazing acting skills can't save this movie. The music by Lisa Gerrard wasn't necessarily bad, but redundant when applied to (over)emotional scenes. That's the way to manipulate crowds: play the violins and let the blood/tears flood the screens. By the way, Gerrard's music was infinitely better and more properly used in ""The Insider"".",Gladiator
380,marydm-43470,A Ridley Scott Masterclass,10,13 January 2019,"Scott reinvents the epic genre with a vengeance. Sharp script, haunting music, spectacular cinematography, but the acting is just off the scale. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix demonstrate what it means for an actor to lose themselves in their role. They become Maximus and Commodus to the extent that you forget who the actors are as you watch. The multi-Oscared Streeps and Day Lewis' of the thespian universe please note how it's done. We don't want to see you in your roles but the characters you are supposed to play. Connie Nielsen was born to play the role of the Roman matron. Both in bearing and demeanor she is the most authentic Roman noble born woman since Sian Phillips' Livia in the BBC series I, Claudius. Harris and Reed give incredibly nuanced turns, but it's hard to name single actor who first do a spectacular job. I fell in love with Djimon Hounsou here...the editing must get an honourable mention. It balanced the overlapping narrative threads with such clarity the viewer is always in the know.
Why is it a masterclass movie? Because you don't need to know a thing about the Roman Empire to fully get into the story and meaning of the movie.

But length alone doesn't make a movie seem long.  In fact, some movies that are very long don't seem very long at all, such as the Lawrence of Arabia, the Godfather movies and Braveheart, all riveting throughout.  No, Gladiator's problem was that it was obviously going for the look and feel of an epic.  It got the look just right.  No question, this movie looked fantastic; can't possibly give an argument there.  Unfortunately, the film didn't have enough story for an epic.  Solution?

Gladiator is a deep, rich, and meticulously detailed visual experience. This is still one of the most breathtaking and epic gladiator movies that I have ever seen. A masterpiece by Ridley Scott with a soulful music ""Now we are free"" that gives you goosebumps not to forget the brilliant screenplay by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, and Oliver Reed.

384,Soysoy,Have you looked at it twice?,4,3 October 2001,"I used to be a big Ridley Scott fan, when masterpieces like Alien and Blade Runner made me think he was almost Kubrick's peer.Since 1492, yet, I wonder who is actually this guy. I just can't believe someone can change so much from artistic craftmanship to commercial fast mediocre production.All of his movies since 1492 has been merely average Hollywood productions, with solid scenery and photography I agree, but nothing more than Roland Joffé or some other directors. And his movies then respected all of Holywood's codification, would it be for the music, the editing etc... CLICHES!! And Scott was almost forgotten by the cinephiles...With Gladiator, suddenly, Scott makes a ""come-back"", with a lot of advertising... Then what is it?Well, to me, it's the same Ridley Scott who made 1492.While Gladiator has a brillant photography, the poor psychology, the mediocre scenery and the bad editing turns the whole thing into an average peplum with lots of visual effects to compensate the lack of substance.Sure, some scenes are very good, Ridley has a lot of savoir-faire then is able to make some very good shots just because he's fundamentally talented.But I simply can't understand how so many people just can't see the vacuity of this film, and the mediocrity of its production!So my question to all the people who rated this film with reverential ""10"" is: Have you actually looked at it twice, and AFTER all the hype?",Gladiator

387,A-Ron-2,"Hmmmm... well, not the worst film I have seen.",6,11 June 2000,"I dunno.  I was really excited about going to see Scott's new film, I am a big fan of his work.  Also, I did part of my undergraduate degree in Ancient History and find Marcus Aureliuz and his reasons for appointing Commodus to be very interesting.  However, I am not one of those picky historians who needs to have every little detail correct.  I realize that film is a fictional medium and accept fully that it will NOT represent historical events accurately, but will alter them to fit the dramatic needs of the story (no one criticizes Shakespeare for doing the same thing, so why attack others).  Hence, I will not dwell on historical inaccuracies... there were a few, but they did not impact my appreciation of the film.*
Regardless of any of these things, the movies just wasn't that good.  The characters were not particularly engaging and the battle scenes were so staged that there was little, if any, serious tension.  I am not really sure what this is, but Gladiator was simply not very exciting. 
Aside from this, the plot was not really germaine to anything that happened in the film.  The characters were sort of placed into the film without any real sense of context for their actions or motivations.  The individual stories that were being told within the movie were not particularly interesting nor did they serve to advance the main plot significantly.  None of this would have been a problem if there had been more action, or more emotion or more... well, something.The acting was good, but the dialogue and story were so generic and dull that this really could not save the film overall.  Richard Harris was good, but underused.  Joaquin Phoenix was fine, but really wasn't given much to do.  Most of the supporting characters were far too one dimensional to allow the actors to shine through.Essentially, this film did all of the things wrong that Braveheart did right (another historically innacurrate, but far superior film) and suffered because of it.  It is truly unfortunate, because I have a certain love for historical dramas when done well (I even liked Titanic), hopefully Mel Gibson will save the genre once again with The Patriot.* Well, there was one that bothered me a bit, the film attempted to end on an up note, but if I remember my Roman history, the death of Commodus lead to a century of civil war and destruction.  This leads me to question Scott's choice of time and historical characters.  A similar film could have been set much earlier, dealing with Nero or Caligula and been more consistent with historical events... oh well.",Gladiator
388,darkjosh,"Powerful, Herculean Filmmaking",9,22 November 2000,"Director Ridley Scott's Gladiator is a stunning, powerful epic that boasts some fantastic visuals, a solid story, deep characters, intense fight sequences, and bravura performances, making it very likely to grab a few Oscar nominations.  At the least, it's certainly the most entertaining film of the 2000 summer.Russel Crowe stars as General Maximus, devoted to the glory of Rome and a successful military man. When the dying Emperor decides to appoint Maximus as his successor, scheming prince Commodus (a brilliant Joaquin Phoenix) decides to do whatever it takes to assure he will be the next Caesar. Maximus escapes his clutches, but then returns to Rome as a gladiator and wants to exact revenge upon the evil emperorAs Maximus, Russel Crowe shows he is not only a great actor, but a star: Gladiator virtually secures his stature as a leading man.  His performance as Maximus is strong and emotional.  Though his acting talent was proven when he played Bud White in Curtis Hanson's atmospheric L.A. Confidential, Gladiator proves he can carry a film as a major star.  His character is also not a cardboard cutout and shows depth: the writers, thankfully, don't make Maximus a macho, indestructible killing machine and instead he shows sensitivity, devotion, power, and strength.Thankfully, the writers do not forget the villainous counterpart and also give Emperor Commodus depth , replacing what could be the usual out-and-out tyrant character with a tragic, weak, and ultimately inept ruler.  Joaquin Phoenix is brilliant as Commodus, in some scenes evoking pity for his character, only to become reviling in the next.  While Gladiator can be seen as a star vehicle for Crowe, it can also be seen as a display of the fantastic talent Joaquin Phoenix has.  His controlled, calculated performance is effectively cringe-inducing.Director Ridley Scott not only gets great performances from the entire cast, but the visual effects employed are equally stunning.  The magnificent views of Rome, the towering, hulking Collosseum, the brutal, striking battles, and intricate costumes all are used to immerse the viewer in the spectacle that was once Rome. While the story may drag a bit in a few places, the overall power is not muted one bit thanks to Scott's masterful helming of this powerful, entertaining film.9 out of 10",Gladiator

390,eamon-hennedy,Rich and Fantastic.,10,21 October 2003,"*****SPOILER ALERT*****I have to say, I love this film. It is without doubt one of my top ten favorite films ever made. This is without doubt one of the most stunning Hollywood blockbuster made in the modern era, ironic considering that it is throwback to the glory days when big budget Hollywood blockbusters were all about great story and and the onslaught of an emotional context. Gladiator does everything right. The script is superb, mixing the personal story of revenge with the political angle of ancient Rome, the performances from all are fantastic and not one actor feels out of place, be it Crowe, Reed, Harris, Phoenix, Jacobi or Nielson, all have their moment and all rise to the occasion. And of course, Ridley Scott. Not giving Ridley Scott the Oscar for Best Direction was the most blatant example of day light robbery at an award session I have ever seen. As a director who has been accused of putting style over substance, here he gets the balance right. He awes us with a fantastic overhead shot of the Coliseum, and then moves us during the final moments when Maximus enters heaven and returns to his wife and child. (Special kudos must also go to Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerard for their fantastic music, haunting and beautifully emotional, it is one of the best music scores that has ever accompanied a film).
The real star here is Russell Crowe. He may be a hell raiser and famous for getting into fights, but he shows us what a versatile talent he is here with a performance that is one of modern Hollywood's true greats. How can one not fail to be moved at Maximus' discovery of his dead family. The scene is superb, with Crowe giving the scene his all, while his chemistry with Oliver Reed is second to none. Having these two trouble makers on screen is superb, and Reed, had he not have sadly died during production, would undoubtedly have seen a renaissance after this film, and possibly an Oscar. The delivery of his speeches to his gladiators are without doubt some of the stand out moments of the film.
Overall this is a superb film, one of the best films to come out of Hollywood in a very long time. Undeniably this is a classic in the making.Gladiator, I salute you.",Gladiator

393,Figgiedan,For the Love of Rome! What a disappointment....,8,19 May 2000,"Ridley Scott has made a real loser. The first third of the movie was tedious - the one battle at the beginning was so messy you couldn't tell what the hell was going on -- ok the horrors of war show that it's crazy and Ridley Scott was trying to make the viewer feel as disoriented as the film's hero -- guess what? It was done better in ""Saving Private Ryan"" and at least in that film you can SEE the fellow soldiers falling around the main character. One ripoff from a film. Also check out how close it comes to ""Braveheart"" in parts --- ""Say, William Wallace is visited by the young queen while in a cell in ""Braveheart"" and that was cool - let's have Maximus visted by the daughter of the king and conspire against her brother just like the young French Queen conspired against King Longshanks in ""Braveheart."" Plus in ""Braveheart"" there's cool battle scenes, let's try that too. Not to mention the obvious, Russell Crowe sure as hell sounds like Mel Gibson, the only difference is he is so miserable in this film and there is no real heroic character development like with Gibson. When his family is killed at the end of the first act, the moral is that Hollywood truism, ""behind every good man is a dead woman and/or child."" It does pick up after that though. The best part in the film was the 2nd act after he's picked up by Oliver Reed and thrown in as a Gladiator - but even here the battle scenes are too messy and you can't tell what the hell is going on - at one point a Legionaire is cut in half by what I thought was only a wooden stick on the chariot - I had to be explained that ""it must've been a blade"" by my companion who came with me to the film. Now that I think about it, we were asking each other what the hell was going on a number of times, mostly due to the jerky camera shots and the loud noises over whispered dialogue. And I never talk during a film. The ending was ludicrous the ""go home Maximus"" and the ""Lucius is safe"" dialogue made me roll my eyes. There was little to no historical value to the film and Rome was pretty damn boring - plus 5 shots of the same part of the ""majestic collosium"" only verified that it was a CGI-generated shot. Christ, even the CGI birds were splotches on the screen...Anyway, there are a few things that were ok - Reed and Crowe were pretty good. Phoenix was ok as the ""unloved by daddy"" emperor. The actress Connie Neilsen who played Lucilla was pretty good and well as Maximus' two ""buddy"" Gladiators. In short, a lousy script, well-acted but 2-dimensional characters, and messy camera shots made this only another film that disappointed me. A 6.5 out of 10 (D) --- Go watch any bit of ""Spartacus,"" two scenes from ""Braveheart,"" and the first 15 minutes of ""Saving Private Ryan."" You'll have the same damn movie.",Gladiator

He plays Maximus, the commander of the Roman Army who is sent to die by Ceasar's son Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix). But when he escapes, he has to join up with these prisoners and fight battles. This film is going to live for a very long time. It has the Braveheart quality but much cooler battle scenes. It may be long but it flows by quickly. I have to give it a 10. Russell Crow is the new action hero and I think he should go the way of Nick Cage(Oscar nod followed by a string of action films). Let's get him two guns, John Woo, and call it a day. He is such a force on screen, you can't help but call him ""The Man"". Gladiator is a must see and a can't miss. It should be number 1 or 2 on all must see film lists.",Gladiator
396,Mr_PCM,The Greatest Epic of the 21st Century,10,7 December 2005,"If only Peter Jackson hadn't come along and done a rather good trilogy of films, we might possibly be talking about the greatest film of the 21st Century so far. Its sweeping but simplistic heroic tale, crunching fight scenes, award-winning special effects, towering acting and soaring score set this film apart from all the pretenders that followed it. Ridley Scott single-handedly re-invented the epic genre with this story of a Roman solider who is betrayed, loses everything and is sold into slavery, only to fight his way back as a gladiator, all the while driven by vengeance for his murdered family.Russell Crowe gives quite simply the performance of a lifetime as the Gladiator Maximus, one that deservedly won him Best Actor at the 2000 Academy Awards (although his performance in the following year's Beautiful Mind was arguably even better, even if it didn't win him his second consecutive Oscar), and provided a thinking woman's alternative to the likes of Pitt, Cruise and Clooney to swoon over. His gravely voice and impressive physique combine to give him a huge presence, which literally fills the screen. His dialogue is sparing, but his actions speak far louder, adding a stoic sadness to his vengeance-driven heroic character. Before Gladiator, Crowe was a good secondary actor; after Gladiator he was catapulted to the top of Hollywood's A-list, and remains there, thanks to this career-making performance proving him to be one of the finest actors of his generation.Joaquin Phoenix is fantastic as the scheming and corrupt Emperor Commodus who betrays Maximus and has his family killed. He manages to be delightfully and totally evil without ever descending into the realms of pantomime villain, which is a tricky line to walk, and manages to avoid being overshadowed by Crowe's monumental performance.The fight scenes are rousing and superbly choreographed, in particular a scene where Maximus marshals his fellow slaves into an army against marauding chariot archers in the Colosseum. The dialogue is kept simple and never overbearing (no need to worry why all of Europe speaks the same language) and culminates in one of the most memorable pieces of script that is destined to join the ranks of 'Play it Sam' and 'Are you talking' to me' as one of the most quoted (and misquoted) lines in movie history  although it is rather wordy. But here it is, in full; 'My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius. Commander of the Armies of the North, General of the Felix Legions, loyal servant to the true Emperor Marcus Aurelius; Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.' As Crowe turns to the Emperor in the arena and delivers this line, it proves to be one of the most electrifying moments in cinema history  hairs will stand up, spines will tingle, guaranteed.The action is set to some truly beautiful music, and it is shameful Hans Zimmer missed out on the Oscar for Best Score. Ridley Scott was similarly unlucky in the Director category.The film is however tinged with sadness, as it proved to be the final (but triumphant) swansong for the careers of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, both of whom died shortly after making this film. Neither could have delivered much finer performances, and if any performance had to be a final one, both delivered one worthy of such a status here. Reed in particular is a revelation, reminding older generations and showing a new generation of his considerable talent.An inspiring film, rousing, exhilarating, exciting and moving. Superbly acted, directed, scored and visualised. A tribute to how great films could be once, and could be again.",Gladiator

Spare yourself the time and watch a much better movie like Spartacus instead, even the TV series is awesome. In that you actually have a protagonist to root for. Maximus is just an obedient general to the emperor Marcus Aurelius who has slaughtered many people in the name of the emperor, whereas Spartacus is about freeing the people born into slavery and the overall breaking of obedience to the ruthless masters, but I digress.

A bit slow in parts but you got to know the characters and see their pain, suffering, greed, lust, revenge and honor.  Great performances by Crowe and Phoenix.A great adventure.

I know standards fall as time goes on, but that's a rating that should be reserved for a movie that will stay with you for years to come.  All About Eve is such a movie; so is the Godfather.  This isn't going to be one.Don't get me wrong, it's great to see old pros (Reed and Harris) and relatively new pros (Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, and Hounsou) go through their paces; Crowe in particular is better than I've ever seen him before. However, the plot is well worn, the dialogue occasionally lapses into silliness, and the CGIs bother me.  I can remember a time (was it really only two decades ago?) when filmmakers who wanted a mindbogglingly spectacular set built one--they did the work, they spent the bucks, they expended the sweat.  The CGI Colosseum seems like cheating, somehow, and several other shots are so obviously faked, they detract from the action.Speaking of the action, it is quite good.  Scott has definitely lost none of his knack for tense pacing; I was surprised to see that two hours had gone by and I hadn't even felt them.  The fight scenes are not only believable, which isn't even remotely a given in action movies, they're so entertaining they inspire not only excitement but a vague sense of guilt.  And after being weaned on the mega-buff steroid stallions of the 80s and early 90s, it's very nice to see the athletic but not Conanesque Maximus in action.All in all, a good flick, but I'm pulling for Traffic or Crouching Tiger to take home the gold statues.

Beginning with an impressively staged battle in Germany, Crowe embodies this warrior with his whole being.  The favorite of Richard Harris' Caesar to take over Rome, Crowe refuses, and ends up as a slave whose only existence is to fight in the arenas, where most of the warriors die very young deaths.  Maximus sees this as his chance to redeem himself.Besides Crowe's terrific performance, Harris and the late Oliver Reed, as Profumo, Maximus' master, deliver wonderful performances.The special effects are amazing as well, from the battle and action sequences, to the renderings of the Colosseum and ancient Rome.  Gladiator is a top-notch action film, and one that signals Russell Crowe as a major star on the rise.",Gladiator
407,Danimal-7,Things I like about GLADIATOR (warning: spoilers),8,4 July 2000,"1.  The battle scenes.  Even on second viewing, they had me on the edge of my seat, teeth locked, fists clenched.  ""Are you not entertained?""  Maximus demands.  Yup, I sure was.  I was scared, horrified, nerve-wracked and at times revolted.  But bored?  Hell, no!2.  Marcus Aurelius.  In every other movie that shows Caesar Marcus Aurelius, the director slobbers all over him and makes him out as an all-wise philosopher.  Ridley Scott portrays him more like what I feel he was: a well-intentioned fool.3.  There are NO CHRISTIANS in this movie!  Scott broke Rule One in Roman-Epic-Making, which saith the plot must be at least tangentially about conflict between persecuted Christians and evil heathens.  Of course, Christianity in Imperial Rome started out as just an insignificant player among many, many cults.  For once we not only get a hero who isn't a Christian, but a hero who is devoutly and warmly pious in the old pagan traditions.4.  The acting.  Everybody does a wonderful job.  Crowe is so subtle that Phoenix upstages him, but they're both excellent.  Crowe, as always, is a master at hinting at deep thoughts that just barely ripple the surface of his face.  Phoenix gives us a wonderful villain, provoking both pity and disgust, whose footsteps on the path from good to evil are clearly visible behind him.  Nielsen, Jacobi, and Hounsou all enrich the movie, and even Harris (perfectly cast) gives a good performance.  And Oliver Reed is delightful; if he is playing himself, as the stories about him suggest, then he must have been an interesting man to know.  It took a lot of good acting to rescue some of the lamer dialogue, but by God they did it.5.  The coliseum.  Some of the rest of Rome looked too colorless and washed out to be believable, but the coliseum was spectacular.  And those tigers! How magnificent!  This truly was the ""grandeur that was Rome.""6.  Tragedy.  Not only does Maximus die, but his death achieves almost nothing.  We know the Republic will never be restored, the ""light"" that is Rome will be snuffed in the Dark Ages, the dream will die.  But Maximus has kept his integrity; he has fulfilled his word to his emperor by seeing that Commodus will not rule Rome; he has done his part to try to restore the Republic, even if it is in vain, and that may not be such a small achievement.7.  Hans Zimmer's score.  Somebody said he lifted it; I don't know if that's true, but if he did then he lifted it from the right place.  It's simple and powerful, perfectly chosen for the scenes.  The Celtic wailing was a bit much at times, but I don't think Zimmer did that part.8.  A small touch, but a good one.  Lucilla, bending over the dying Maximus, does not say ""I love you,"" which she surely must have been thinking. Instead, she says ""Go to them.""  Which, when you think about it, is really a much better demonstration of how much she cared about Maximus than the more obvious line would have been.And some things I didn't like...1.  The ending.  Ten points for having the guts to kill the hero off.  But Lucilla's and Gracchus' ""truly this was the noblest Roman of them all""-type posturing was pompous and unnecessary.  If we had to have an epitaph, it would have been better just to have Lucius say one sentence: ""There will be no more games as long as I reign.""  Of course that would probably be historically inaccurate, but since when did that ever stop a good storyteller?2.  Tigers Lite?  An adult male tiger weighs 500 pounds.  I don't care if you're Arnold Schwarzenegger, if one of those things jumps on your back, you're going DOWN and staying there.3.  Maximus' home.  Farmers that stand immobile, a mother and child we never get to know before they die.  It all sounded so much better when Maximus described it then when we saw it.But I'm just carping to show that I paid attention.  GLADIATOR's a magnificent movie.  For heaven's sake, fork over the money to see it on the big screen.",Gladiator
408,RestlessRust,"""Braveheart"" it isn't.",6,15 January 2001,"WARNING:  The last line may contain a possible spoiler.   The massive popularity of ""Gladiator"" blows my mind.  Yes, it is an entertaining movie, but it is hardly the type of movie (historic, epic, depressingly dark) that usually appeals to most movie-goers.  In some ways, this movie reminded me more of bleak, cautionary Sci-Fi flicks like ""The Running Man"" (""look at the darkness the human heart is capable of"" type movies) rather than the heart-breaking human dramas recent epics like ""Braveheart"" and ""Rob Roy"" have been.   But I think the weakest part of the movie is the villain, Commodus.  He's too weak to carry the movie, and since the driving force of the movie is Maximus' desire to avenge what was done to him and his family, that is a fatal weakness.  Commodus' only skill is making sure his enemies are incapacitated in some way (or at least outnumbered) before they can get anywhere near him.  You see, he knows how pathetic he really is, so he doesn't allow himself to get into a position in which he is likely to get the living daylights beat out of him (which just about anyone in this movie could do to him).   Maybe it's just me.  Maybe I wanted an evil villain instead of one that just frustrated me so much.  Perhaps the thought of a ruler who doesn't deserve his power will be enough conflict for other viewers.  But Commodus' weaknesses seem so obvious, I just wanted to stand up and tell everyone to open their eyes.  ""This is the man you let *lead* you?!""  But no one in this movie, except Maximus, can see Commodus for what he really is.  (Well, some could, but they wouldn't do anything about it, for some reason.)  So how can I feel any satisfaction seeing such a weak man finally get his due?",Gladiator
409,cinemel,The ancient Roman epic genre is well-served by Ridley Scott's new film.,8,7 May 2000,"GLADIATOROver 30 years has elapsed since the heyday of the epic spectaculars of the ancient world. Ridley Scott, director of `Blade Runner,' `Alien,' and `Thelma & Louise,' has brought his fine sense of visuals to renew the genre in his latest film, `Gladiator.' The jumping off point in Roman history is very close to Anthony Mann's `Fall of the Roman Empire' (1964). Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), Roman emperor, is trying to finish off the barbarian hordes who have been attacking at the northern edge of the empire at the Germanic border. Maximus (Russell Crowe), his top general, is ready to finish off the enemy and does in a brutal Saving Private Ryan-like battle. As a matter of fact, he does such a great job, Aurelius wants him to be his successor, passing over the emperor's own son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Of course, the overlooked son will have none of this and these circumstances set up the relationships and vengeance for the remainder of the saga. Connie Nielsen portrays Commodus' widowed sister and former lover of Maximus. The rest of the film continues from the northern empire to the north of Africa where Maximus is trained as a gladiator and ultimately back to Rome itself where the final conflicts play themselves out.The film owes much to the epics of the 50's and 60's. The look and style of film is definitely current. However, the small gladiatorial arena in Africa is reminiscent of `Spartacus.' Later sequences in the great Roman Coliseum recall `Quo Vadis,' `Barabbas,' and even `Ben-Hur'. The performances are uniformly good, especially Oliver Reed as slave owner and gladiator trainer, Proximo. Reed died three weeks before filming was completed and computer graphics were utilized to scan his face on another actor to complete his scenes. Other computer-generated effects are unnoticeable for the most part, but some matte paintings are obvious as such, though quite effective.
Of course, most viewers have come for the action sequences seen briefly in the previews and talk show promotions. The action is fast with lots of quick cutting making some of the conflicts difficult to follow. However, they do have a visceral effect, as those early scenes in Private Ryan did. It is fortunate that the connecting dialogue material is smooth and not over-ripe as some of the similar exposition in the 50's-60's films. Phoenix is particularly fine in actually making the viewer sympathize with him. Christopher Plummer played the role way over the top in the earlier `Roman Empire' epic. Nielsen has some genuinely emotional moments with him as incest rears its ugly head, a topic not even hinted at in the earlier film. Sophia Loren and Stephen Boyd were quite wooden in the parts here played by Crowe and Nielsen. Loren always had trouble being natural in English-speaking roles in her early career. Her rare interior and exterior beauty often compensated for that.Scott has created a realistic, though sometimes stylized, ancient world. Viewers hungry for the majesty and conflict of those classic films will not be disappointed. The magnificent widescreen cinematography, best viewed on a large screen, will surely help the 2 hours and 34 minutes seem faster moving than much shorter films today. Hopefully, this film will be a revival of a much-loved genre of years gone by.",Gladiator
410,Mario64,Very good but overrated.,7,11 August 2001,"Gladiator is a very good movie. Russel Crow and Jaquin Pheonix both give quality performances and the movie is exciting and fun. The gladiator scenes in this movie were done well and interesting to watch, even though I have no idea how realistic they are. Still this movie is definatly not best picture quality. The screenplay is good, not great, and the story is really only slightly better than average. This movie has many similarities to another movie I felt was overrated, Braveheart. It's still very good, just not great. I give Gladiator an 8 out of 10.",Gladiator

With that established, probably the most fascinating thing about this film is that it plays out almost exactly like _What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?_ for men.  The conflict between Phoenix and Crowe for the approval/authority of the father figure (at least on Phoenix's side) parallels very closely with that of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford in the earlier film.  Seriously.  Watch both of them and then try to say that you can't possibly imagine Phoenix breaking out into that creepy ""I've Written a Letter to Daddy"" song.  Ugh.",Gladiator
412,teejayniles2345,Plot goes haywire - power surges abound,10,30 March 2001,"Gladiator overwhelmed the opposition in Academy voting this year.  Yet those who cry ""foul"" are strikingly naive in their calls for some sort of recount. It is a prime example of Oscar voters going for a big winner when the ""second-place"" entries managed to cancel out one another's separate claims to be better overall films.  This BEST PICTURE shows signs of being less than the sum of most of its commendable parts, due in greatest part to its haywire plot.  Like the much feared power surges for people's home and work computers, it has plenty of emotional highs and striking brief scenes or cuts but they short-circuit the narrative that you want to puzzle through after the final credits.  I believe the screenplay could have made some sort of ""revisionist"" sense about an introspective Emperor but he is throttled and overthrown in some sort of flip-flop of fortunes that's left unexplained.  Don't blame Joaquin Phoenix for overacting when he seemingly improvises with the lurching dialogue.  For anybody trying to make sense of slavery and gladiators, see a much better film from 1960, Spartacus. Back then actor Kirk Douglas and buddies were telling the director what the finished product should be.  Nowadays, the director uses all the arrows in his quiver to nail us to the trees and we wonder what's hit us as the spectacle overpowers the story.",Gladiator
413,NateW,Great action,9,15 January 2001,"I went into this movie expecting alot, and it delivered. The action sequences are spectacular and the performances are very good as well.

I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a historical epic or just something to rent for the weekend. 9/10",Gladiator
414,frankiehudson,Lincoln as Gladiator,10,16 February 2002,"This is a magnificent Ridley Scott film, honoured by a sensational score from Hans Zimmer.Gladiator has all of the visual flare that you come to expect from Ridley Scott, this time enhanced by brilliant use of computer graphics (note the rendering of Rome).  Hans Zimmer produces a good score, featuring also Lisa Gerrard.Oliver Reed does himself justice in what turns out to be his valedictory role.My final thought is that at the end of the film, just before succumbing to his trecherous wounds from Commodus, the title gladiator Maximus announces 'free my men'!  He is clearly President LINCOLN all along, playing out a noble quest to free all slaves and democratise the nation.  This is reinforced by the final, end tribute from the freed black gladiator who says that they've all been freed by Maximus.
NB. Buy this on the special edition DVD, which features tons of stuff on the music (interview with Hans Zimmer), making of, documentaries about gladiators, etc.  the DVD is brilliant!",Gladiator
415,Philaura,Not Best Picture Material - but Entertaining,7,26 March 2001,"The biggest mystery about this film is that Russell Crow got the Best Actor award. His performance was the least impressive of all the Best Actor nominees. Four extremely talented actors with outstanding performances lost to a TV movie of the week performance. How does that happen? He wasn't even cast well. How can you make a Gladiator movie without the beefcake! Russell Crow never exposes ""the gladiator's"" outrageous upper body.  He's always covered up.  Perhaps we should thank him for that.  Don't get me wrong...it's an entertaining view...just got way too much credit.",Gladiator
416,Uthman,Visually stunning; effectively revives a grand genre,9,7 May 2000,"Combining visual elements pioneered in BLADE RUNNER with battle scenes depicted in a way reminiscent of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, director Ridley Scott has successfully revived the long dead genre of movies about ancient Rome. Yes, there have been pathetic, postmodern attempts to cinematically resurrect Rome since the Golden Age of ancient epics of the 50s and early 60s, but none have come close to the historic-artistic integration that Scott has pulled off in GLADIATOR. This movie is so beautiful, that a slide show of selected stills could stand on its own as a work of art.An excellent cast is headed by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, the latter being the first actor to succeed at portraying one of the ""bad"" Roman emperors as something more than a one-dimensional villain. Even evil Emperors deserve better depiction than Hollywood has given them over the years. Connie Nielsen, absolutely ravishing in Roman finery, also carries her role very well. Richard Harris, as Marcus Aurelius, is so good that he really does look like a dying man (I sure hope it's just good acting and makeup!), and of course, it's always great to see Derek Jacobi in a show about ancient Rome. Oliver Reed was excellent in his last film; he will be missed.I predict that GLADIATOR will catalyze a revival of public interest in ancient Rome, which is a long time coming. I hope also that this film heralds a renaissance in Ridley Scott's career. It had been way too long since ALIEN and BLADE RUNNER.",Gladiator

Riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight.I watched the movie again today 20 years later and yeah, it just doesn't hold up.

This was a good movie, well worth your time but this was not a great movie.  The story line was borrowed from a half dozen different movies depicting gladiators.  The acting was professional  but the only Academy Award performance I saw was Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius and that part was so small it had no impact on the film.  Definitely not family fare as it is very bloody from start to finish.  Preview this movie but it would become very tiring in any film library.  I rated this a 7.",Gladiator
420,Denver53,"Amazing visuals, but little sense",7,15 January 2001,"Last week a co-worker told me her husband thought Gladiator was ""the best movie he has every seen."" I figured I should finally see it, and we watched it on PPV. Now I guess I know more about my co-worker's husband.We rated Gladiator a 7, and that is due to the terrific visual settings that convey an epic scope to the film. Without those settings, it would have been a 5. Gladiator revolves around the beliefs and actions of its main character, a man who seems to be stuck in the past and unable to see much around him for what it is. When his luck turns bad after a succession at the top, you feel sorry for the guy but also wonder why such a great leader of men didn't wake up sooner.Honor, loyalty and ""the good of Rome"" is at the heart of Gladiator. If you don't buy into those concepts, then you have a hard time caring much about Maximus or his journey. In this case, I had a hard time with several things, including:Maximus is portrayed as a successful leader who wants Rome to return to rule by the people through the Senate. Setting aside questions about whether the Senators actually represent ""the people"" well, the film makes absolutely no effort to show you anything about Rome that is worth preserving. Its citizens are described several times as a ""mob."" It's leadership spent years on a crusade in Germania that even the emporer said solved nothing. There are no scenes showing citizens who hope for anything better, be it democracy or real leadership or a vision. So what is it, exactly, Maximus wants to save by supporting the Senate? Even Maximus lives so far outside Rome on his nice spread that people call him ""The Spaniard."" He had never even *been* to Rome! Why should the viewer care who rules Rome?Maximus is never set up properly as a fighter who could be an amazing gladiator. In the film's initial battle, he rides on a horse against basically a horde of undisciplined neo-Vikings on foot, and attacks from the rear, no less. He manages to survive, but we never see that he has any special skill in battle other than as a leader. From there we suddenly must believe that he can defeat five or more gladiators in a 5 vs. 1 scenario where his opponents have armor and better weapons! How did that happen? There must have been some great training going on in the gladiator school.The film also never does enough to show Maximum's anger and motivation to meet the new emporer after Maximum's family is slaughtered (no big spoiler; by now you should know his motivation). Is he mourning? Yes. Is he mad? I guess. But he is never seething, or furious, or even apparently taking out his anger on his opponents. He simply kills mechanically, then moves on.At one point a big deal is made of the fact that to survive in the Roman games, Maximus must ""win the crowd."" He promptly goes out into the colisseum with his school's fighters and they win, but not with any flair. Yet suddenly the crowd loves Maximus. Should't we have seen some effort on his part to win them over? This scene was especially disappointing because it is Maximus' first face-to-face with the emporer. Yet we see no emotion, no feeling. Just resignation. It was anti-climactic and a letdown.I'm not sure why some people loved this film. Maybe they buy into the honor, loyalty, old soldier thing. I do, too, when I feel it is warranted. In this case, Maximus reminded me of most Kevin Costner characters: He is there, but wooden, and not very sympathetic. Russell Crowe may have played Maximus as too deadened by grief and not motivated enough by life or revenge. Ultimately, I was mostly uninterested.",Gladiator
421,Calysta,One of the year's highlights?,10,2 June 2000,"Any movie not plugged for mass hysteria and advancements of special effects that seem to occur with every movie released promising unique and original experiences is literally a must-see. Although the film currently co-incides with the release of ""Mission Impossible 2"", this is definitely the more intelligible and less senseless of the two. ""Gladiator"" proves that an epic can be good, produced on a massive scale and not run over three hours. Sometimes two and a half hours however, is still not enough to finish a large popcorn and drink.One of the most noticeable elements of the film is its breathtaking cinematography, much of it possible by the special effects and beautiful European locations, not reliant on exploding helicopters, let alone the flaming city of the Rome. Spectacular battle sequences, a glimpse into an interpretation of the afterlife and even the employment of the simple slow motion technique provide handsome treats for the eyes.
Russell Crowe is the general turned slave, turned gladiator, turned risen hero, turned Hollywood star. His rugged, reluctant performance is naturally the centrepiece of the movie, although almost the entire cast turns in good performances, enhanced by an above average screenplay.
The only disappointing performance is from Joaquain Phoenix, whose pompous Commodus evokes a road company Peter Ustinov as Emperor Nero from ""Quo Vadis"", only no one will be handing any Academy Award nominations or nods of any sort to him. In terms of the possible bouquets handed out to ""Gladiator"", come February 2001, it looks like the film will be receiving a whole lot of them.   ""Gladiator"" evokes the classic epics of the Golden Era, ""Ben-Hur"", ""Spartacus"" and the definitive biblical epic, ""Quo Vadis."" Although the latter was filmed under more strained, theatrical-like conditions now almost fifty years ago, ""Gladiator"" is reminiscent of the film, albeit a more attractive looking one. Its plot line even seems to be similar, Ancient Rome, corrupt authorities, handsome hero falling for the forbidden fruit...a woman, even if Crowe's has a sense of partial fidelity amid faith and personal devastation. The success of ""Gladiator"" has been enjoyed, primarily because the current generation has yet to see such a grand, lavish epic. Since I am fifteen, I can truthfully state this is the only large scale, true historical epic I have ever seen, made in the current day. Since there's enough historical accuracy, heroes, special effects and gory battle violent sequences, which insures box office and something for everyone, there's enough in this film to convince me that, for now, Hollywood may be capable once again of occasionally making films like they used to. Rating: 10/10",Gladiator
422,Jetset971,Good summer movie but Oscar worthy?,7,14 May 2010,"I have had a great deal of discussions with people about this film. I agree it is a good movie. Its entertaining, action packed, worth the price of a ticket. However, I don't think I have ever seen a movie win so many awards without questioning the validity. Gladiator, while still a good film, is hardly deserving of all its accolades. I mean it might be worthy of winning cinematography or production awards or special effects but Best picture? Best Actor? I could think of a 100 other movies in the year 2000 more deserving than this movie. Don't misunderstand, I like this movie, but the problem is that movie awards like the Oscars,presumably, are there to honor high quality and High achievements in each respected field. Russel Crowe does an adequate job, but his acting in his other Oscar nominated films like ""The Informant"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"" were light years ahead of his performance in ""Gladiator"". Furthermore, Giving best picture to this film was mind boggling. I personally feel that the only reason this movie was even in the running at all, was because of the money it made. It was a good action movie and nothing more. Hey, remember that ""Couching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" was also up for best picture that year. In my opinion, It ran circles around ""Gladiator"". Wheras ""Gladiator' was just a good action film. CTHD was a phenomenal action movie and love story and should have won the top prize.",Gladiator

It is a fun summer movie that isn't stupid!!! As opposed to most blockbusters from the summer season, this movie has a plot! And not a bad one. Granted, it is not highly original, and it certainly isn't exceptional, but it is very appropriate  for the movie. Russel Crowe's character, Maximus, is very simple, but Crowe has the power to make you care about him, and believe in what he believes. A very good hero indeed. Joaquin Phoenix is satisfying as Commodus, but he relies too heavily on the same techniques to make you feel how is character feels. But he makes you hate Commodus and, that is his role in the movie: the bad guy. He does it well but not incredibly well. Connie Nielsen is good as Lucinda. So, the cast is good, particularly Crowe as the hero. Ridley Scott's directing is perfect. The confusion of the arena is well portrayed, and you see very well how horrible this place was. The sets are incredible, and you can't say what is real and what is CGI. The action sequences are thrilling. As I said earlier, the story isn't too deep or original but it works.

Gladiator tries to be(or imitate) something like Ben Hur and Spartacus but fails in many ways. I agree that the visual effects are amazing, but the score is not a masterpiece and the most important thing-in my idea-the screenplay is too ordinary and has nothing particular and new to present. It seems that the real point of killing Maximus is to make audiences cry.( I couldn't find any other reason to get him killed). But, in some ways the movie is worth watching.

The budget and the decent castensure that Gladiator is a competent film, but its by no means a goodone.Sure, there are some genuinely engaging fight sequences, but that's_all_ Gladiator has going for it.  And to be brutally frank, they'renot all that great technically.  Crowe gives it his best shot, but hisopponents have to do a lot of incompetent poses to allow him to chopthem up, and for me that ruins any actual dramatic effect that theaction sequences might have had. The extended conversations are just boring.  The characters are wellacted, but are sketchy and uninvolving, and I just can't bring myselfto care about any of them.  And sure, Maximus has a sad story, but sowould all of his fellow gladiators, yet we don't get to hear themwhining.

It successfully brings the pagan Roman of the period to the eyes of the audience. The movie reflects the lifestyle in Rome quite well. It shows that senators elected by the people in the nonsense of the Republic think only of their own interests. While watching the movie, you can see that Westerners and Romans disregard human life just for fun. It tells people that they killed them without pity and that they did not give a little value to human life.

Veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed make the whole affair that bit classier, and it's a fine swan song for the latter.So what if the plot is an old chestnut, we haven't seen this kind of film for a while, and it's done very well. Protestations of historical inaccuracies should be ignored  it's a sad day when we can't enjoy a spirited yarn without being force-fed a history lesson, for no other reason than to keep the pedants happy.  Mention should be made of the effective CGI utilised to bring ancient Rome to life, and the impressive (if vaguely familiar) score. Lots of little touches combine to make this superb entertainment, the best film Scott has given us in some time.

431,Bungle-9,"Brutal, bloody, loud and great",10,12 May 2000,"Saw this the day it came out over here. Had been waiting for it for a seriously long time. Lived up to my expectations.Loads of typical epic elements are present in this film. Death, glory, love, lust, blood and adventure. The overall plot isn't too different from Spartacus, but should be treated as a completely different film. I mean to say that there can't be just one film on Roman gladiators. There's no point in making a benchmark of a film. It just limits the possibilities.The actors were brilliant, and most of all Crowe, who just slips into every role he gets with the greatest amount of ease. We've now discovered a new generation of good actors, and definitely in the form of Crowe. Harris' short-lived role was well played, and the late Oliver Reed puts in a marvellous performance as Proximo (an honourary post-humous award of some description wouldn't go amiss!). Phoenix was relly menacing in his place, and made me hate his character's guts!The camerawork in some places was reminiscent of that of Janusz Kaminski in Saving Private Ryan. It's a good technique that gives the audience the feeling of chaos and atmosphere. Ridley Scott uses his usual flair to produce some excellent visuals, like the Collisseum (even though over half of it was CGI).Last but not least, Hans Zimmer's score was perfectly suited to the task of capturing action and intimate moments in the film. During the battle scenes the music often sounds like Gustav Holst's 'Mars, Bringer of War' from his Planets suite. Very good idea. Well suited to the scenes of combat and war.Overall, Gladiator is an amazing spectacle. And I'd like to finish by saying: RUSSELL CROWE RULES!! But I won't (lol)",Gladiator

Russell Crowe plays the title role (Maximus) to perfection and makes it impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Winning an Oscar as Best Actor (it was really a consolation prize for his loss last year for ""The Insider"") made me VERY happy and he was very humble and dignified while making his acceptance speech at the Oscars in March. Joaquin Phoenix made an incredible breakthrough as the villain Commodus and should have won the supporting actor Oscar for his performance, while Miss Connie Nielsen is convincing as Lucilla, Commodus' sister and Maximus' love interest (but only as a lukewarm love interest since he has eyes really for his late wife). The sets which also should have won (they lost to ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", but the brilliant costumes won so there is some consolation in that) and the score as well. The Academy is just getting more and more benevolent in regards to splitting the awards evenly between several different movies. But ""Gladiator"" by far is the winner of the year.

433,pninson,A solid spectacular,7,21 May 2008,"I grew up in the heyday of the sword-and-sandal spectaculars; I was ten years old when THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE was released. That film bombed at the box office and brought down a studio, and the genre died.It wasn't until GLADIATOR hit the screens that the old-fashioned historical epic was revived. The story is set at the same time as FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE and features some of the same historical characters. The basic plot, however, is quite different, and of course film technology has changed.FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE featured ruinously expensive sets; GLADIATOR was able to recreate ancient Rome with computer generated visuals. There's a certain stiffness to CGI that you don't see in the older films, but it still produces a level of detail that would otherwise be impossible. The Colosseum comes to vivid life, and the production design creates a decadent look reminiscent of FELLINI SATYRICON.The story is fairly simple; one might call it WALKING TALL, Roman style. The wise emperor Marcus Aurelius intends to name the general Maximus as his successor, but his son Commodus has other ideas. Maximus narrowly escapes assassination, but returns home to find his family murdered by Commodus, now Emperor.The film works because Russell Crowe's performance makes you believe in his character. Maximus is a generic hero, but Crowe breathes life into him and brings out dimensions that aren't in the script. A lesser actor could have made this a very dull film indeed.Supporting performances by the priceless Derek Jacobi, Oliver Reed, and Djimon Honsou round out the excellent cast.Where the film falters is in Joaquin Phoenix's characterization of the Emperor Commodus. He is not lethal, threatening, or even interestingly unbalanced. He is a crybaby, a wimp who pouts and sniffles in every scene. FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE suffers from a terrible performance by Stephen Boyd in the lead role; GLADIATOR has the opposite problem: a dull, whiny villain. The problem is more the script than the actor, but Phoenix is unable to find an interesting dimension and ultimately is only annoying. It's easy to believe Maximus can swat him aside like a fly.As a result, the last twenty minutes or so are anticlimactic. The final sequence is effective, however, and again imbues the heroic Maximus with a believably human dimension.It's unfortunate that the success of GLADIATOR didn't lead to a revival of the genre. TROY did not do great box office in 2004, and that may have made the Hollywood execs skittish again. Too bad. GLADIATOR was a welcome respite from endless summer sequels and costumed superhero films, and it's a worthy successor to the classics like EL CID and SPARTACUS.",Gladiator
434,keihan,Strength and honor,9,22 May 2000,"When one boils down all the elements of ""Gladiator"", this is the one phrase in the entire film that stands out the most to me. These are ultimately the words Maximus (played by a stunning, rawly powerful Russell Crowe) lives by and dies by. To most of us at the other end of the two millenia mark, the idea is corny, a punchline for a bad joke (indeed, I felt that this have been the point of the little satirical presentation outside the Collusium). For soldiers, men who put their lives on the line every day, it's a way of life. It's what kept Maximus going, even after everything he ever loved or fought for (the ideal of Rome, the emperor that he fought under for so many years, his family) were no more. There's no honor in going to your grave with business unfinished. To finish it, therefore, you need strength. As the Romans were always hailed as a practical people, the motto makes perfect sense to me.But ""Strength and honor"" go beyond even that simple definition in the film's context. Not only does Maximus use his strength to survive another brutal day in the arena against five heavily armed and armored opponents, but he lends his strength to his comrades-in-arm in a fixed reenactment, turning a certain slaughter into a triumph. Not only does Maximus' sense of honor stop him from hailing an emperor who has none of his respect, but also makes him spare the life of a fallen opponent the entire Collusium wants him to end...until the moment he doesn't.Harlan Ellison has written that it is never the common man who changes things, but the uncommon man. If Ridley Scott's sheer visual epic is anything, it is a celebration of that man, a man who still believes in ""Strength and honor"".",Gladiator

It ends up being about a man who had everything taken from him and finds himself taking a stand for the people against one who wished to rule by his own will.",Gladiator
436,MadReviewer,"Very Entertaining, if Slightly Overrated, Epic",8,17 April 2001,"`Gladiator' is a splendid, action-packed throwback to sandal epics such as `Spartacus'. Russell Crowe is Maximus, a general in the Roman army. After crushing an army of Gauls, Maximus meets with the Emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). Marcus Aurelius tells Maximus that he wishes Rome to become a Republic once more, after his death . . . and that he would like Maximus to help create this new Republic. Afterwards, Aurelius goes to see his spoiled son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), and tells him that he does not feel Rome should have another Emperor.  In a fit of rage, Commodus kills Aurelius and becomes emperor, and then promptly orders the execution of Maximus. Maximus manages to escape his own death . . . . but his wife and son, alas, do not.  Fast forward a few years (exactly how the following transpires is never clear), and Maximus is a slave, a gladiator forced to kill in order to entertain the Roman people.  As his popularity as a gladiator grows, Maximus begins to see how he can exact his vengeance upon Commodus.For the most part, `Gladiator' is well-acted. Russell Crowe is quietly intense as the former general Maximus, and manages to effortlessly pull off a memorable performance in what could've been a wooden role in other hands. Richard Harris is good as the wise and weary Marcus Aurelius, and the late Oliver Reed is excellent in his final role as Proximo, the cunning gladiator trainer.  The weak link of the cast is Joaquin Phoenix, who I still can't believe was nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his stiff, awkward portrayal of Commodus.  I found him annoying instead of terrifying  Commodus needed to be a fearful tyrant, and instead he was little more a petulant child.  This might have been more how the role was written instead of Joachim Phoenix's acting skill, but the character of Commodus still brought the movie down. Ridley Scott's direction is superb  the battle scenes and the gladiator fights are wonderfully done, and the movie has a grand, epic feel that's been missing from the big screen for far too long.  The use of CGI to recreate Rome is incredible as well.  Where the film falls apart to a certain extent is the story  there are a few plot holes that are just big enough to be distracting.  For example, the audience watching `Gladiator' in the theater or at home on their DVD player are given plenty of reasons to hate the vile Commodus . . . but it's never made clear why the Roman people would hate him.  The Emperor puts on lots of gladiator tournaments, gives out free bread, free wine  hey, the average Roman should love Commodus!  So why isn't he?  Little points like this drag `Gladiator' down slightly  and while these detractions certainly don't make `Gladiator' a bad film, I think they're enough to pull it down off the masterpiece mantel.  Personally, while I really liked `Gladiator', I think even nominating it for Best Picture of 2000 was a stretch, and as for actually winning the Best Picture Oscar . . . no.  It's good, but not that good.Still, an intense epic worth watching.  A-",Gladiator
437,Laitue_Gonflable,"A good piece of cinema, but a great movie",9,14 March 2003,"The only way, I have found, to completely objectively rate this movie, is to discriminate between it as a 'movie' and as a piece of 'cinema', the latter being the more arty, deep and ultimately pretentious films made only to further the world of cinema today rather than just to make money as the former.As a movie, Gladiator is completely brilliant: the individual film-making sections work so well together to bring this epic tale to the big screen. There are flawless performances, excellent cinematography, and the art direction and costume design are perfect, both for film-lovers and for historical nit-pickers.Ridley Scott's direction does well to bring to life the great tale of a Roman general turned gladiator-slave, Maximus Decimus Meridus (Russell Crowe) who defies and overthrows the wrongful and villainous emperor of Rome, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The director manages to invoke exceptional performances from the entire cast and leaves us wanting more. One of the other most enjoyable parts of this movie is Hans Zimmer's score, moving in every scene and creating a mood matched by few movie scores. Personally I think Zimmer was ripped off at the 2000 Oscars.Now for the spoilers. As a piece of cinema, Gladiator struggles. The central interaction between the two main protagonists is brilliantly done and the under-tone of each battle scene is well portrayed, that Maximus kills only when he is required to and that is enough for him to go on to the afterlife. However, the film itself is fundamentally inaccurate, historically speaking. History tells us that Commodus was a fine emperor, beloved by his people, far from the evil, plotting emperor we see Phoenix portraying here. Naturally, the screenwriter Franzoni, Logan and Nicholson decided to use artistic license and alter the lines of history in order to make a one-off, unconnected movie. But for this reason, the attempt to incorporate political ideas into this movie fails, as it tries to create a tale of a new, young emperor struggling to follow in the footsteps of his beloved older father, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). But neither the senate nor the real emperor Commodus would ever have had problems on this score. Hence, the 'movie' chooses to write its own rules in order to tell a story, under the pretence that is a historical epic.Also, while not intending to say anything of a racist nature, the casting is slightly odd. Personally I have had a little trouble recently understanding the fact that the gladiator referred to as the 'Spaniard' is played by Russell Crowe who, in this movie, speaks in more of an Australian accent than any other type, while the Hispanic actor Phoenix portrays the Roman Emperor. This is not to say that both actors do not do a tremendous job in their roles, it is just that Phoenix does not, in the end, look much like Richard Harris' son and Connie Neilsen's brother. But overall I don't think it is important, for the simple fact that Phoenix pulls off one of the most amazing and empathetic performances ever to grace a movie screen. Personally I believe that in the past decade, there have been only two truly great villainous performances; Phoenix is one, the other, more recently, being Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of New York. As a sidetrack, Gangs of NY actually contained the similar ambiguous casting, with English-born Day-Lewis playing an American 'native', while Leonardo DiCaprio, born and raised in Hollywood, played the Irish settler.Back to Gladiator, and Ridley Scott's direction being another element to diminish this as a piece of cinema. There is nothing wrong with Scott's direction, it is perfect. But it is cliched, the film is very Hollywood, set against an almost monochromatic ancient backdrop. While the art direction and so forth are all stunning, Scott uses them only as a background to the main tale which is nothing original. It is a little too hackneyed, I would say, to have the main protagonist, despite however many people he has killed, to be the dedicated family man who wants vengeance for the murder of his wife and son and so the character of Maximus does not quite work on that score. But that is the only problem; the battle sequences, both in the arena and in times of Roman conquest, are all impeccably directed and are, unlike some of my other comments, historically realistic as far as we can tell in this day and age. It is actually an accurate depiction of the way people fought during that time period.And finally to mention the performances more in-depth, they are all flawless. Despite the visually odd casting as previously mentioned, Crowe and Phoenix are perfectly cast and perfectly directed to extract brilliant performances in two very difficult roles. While the stand-out for me is always Phoenix, the minor characters also play a very important role. Connie Neilsen produces what I think is her best performance to date as the frightened and virtuous Lucilla, Djimon Hounsou is great as Maximus' fellow gladiator, while Marcus Aurelius and Antonius Proximo provide two later roles for two great and esteemed careers of Richard Harris and Oliver Reed respectively. Having said this, I think that the most perfectly cast is Derek Jacobi as Senator Gracchus. When all is said and done, Jacobi contains far and away the most credibility of the minor characters, both visually and in terms of his performance. It is not an entirely difficult role to play but Jacobi achieves it to perfection.Overall, Gladiator is outstanding viewing and what will become a classic for everybody to see. It is powerful, moving, tense and not overly violent and for these reasons it is extremely widely accessible. As a piece of 'cinema', four stars, as a movie, five.",Gladiator
438,PaulLondon,Welcome back Ridley Scott,8,4 November 2000,"After a decade in the wilderness Scott has made a triumphant return with the exciting ""Gladiator"".  I did, admittedly, take a while to get into this but once I got caught up in it I was swept along with the spectacle. Terrifically cast with good, charismatic actors the powerful acting raises this above the level of many recent blockbusters.  The battle scenes are exciting and gory (and, interestingly enough, put us in the same position as the blood-thirsty audiences in the colisseum)and counterbalance the film's quieter moments successfully. The storyline is nothing new and there are no hidden depths, but, it is made with such panache that it is hard not to like. Special mention for the touching dedication to Ollie Reed-a real character who brought a bit of colour to our screens and gives a good final performance here.",Gladiator

But mostly I don't think the negative reviewers see the depth and get annoyed with the violence. The movie does have plenty of violence. But gore? I don't know what Mary Poppins spinoffs they've been feeding on, but there's a whole buncha movies out there that have more gore. Gladiator flashes the 'chop off the arm' or the 'split the skull' scene very quickly. You know it happened but barely see it.There is much more to this movie than action or gore. All the main actors are good or better. I saw a touching scene here, a real feeling there. And hell, no movie and I mean no movie has ever before given viewers so much of ancient Rome to look at. What a great job of computer rendering!For those who haven't been watching movies for 40 years, this is the same basic story that was the basis for the 'Fall of the Roman Empire', made in the 60's. Sophia Loren was Lucilla, Stephen Boyd as Maximus, Christopher Plummer as Commodus and Obi Wan Kenobi as Marcus Aurelius. Similar but different, I prefer Gladiator.",Gladiator

443,roystephen-81252,The new standard for sword-and-sandal epics,10,28 February 2016,"Being somewhat of a history buff, I've always loved historical movies. My only gripe was that up to the 1990s none of those movies really managed to convey a sense of authenticity. The sets, the costumes, the hairstyles, the battles – everything was too polished, too artificial. I think it was with movies like Dances with Wolves (Kevin Costner, 1990), Braveheart (Mel Gibson, 1995), Saving Private Ryan (Steven Spielberg, 1998) and The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (Luc Besson, 1999) that things finally started to change, and historical films moved towards a more realistic depiction of the various eras – not necessarily in terms of historical facts but the feel. But one thing was still missing: a similar movie set in ancient times, that would reinvigorate the sword-and-sandal genre by matching the epic visuals of Ben-Hur with the new, grittier and more believable look and feel.Ridley Scott's Gladiator, a wonderfully written, timeless revenge story with gripping performances from Russell Crowe, Richard Harris, and Oliver Reed (plus Joaquin Phoenix, Djimon Hounsou & Connie Nielsen), and accompanied by Hans Zimmer's and Lisa Gerrard's trend-setting, haunting score, was that movie. It truly revived the genre and was quickly followed by a string of similar movies (out of which, unfortunately, only one - Wolfgang Petersen's Troy – measured up to the high standard set by Gladiator). It doesn't really matter that Ridley Scott's movie is full of inaccuracies. It's thrilling, it's heartbreaking, it feels real. I have seen it countless times and it never gets boring.Note: The extended cut is even better than the theatrical version.",Gladiator
444,Ysman,"Hey Joey, Do you like Gladiator movies?",7,25 May 2000,"Gladiator seemingly brings back the ""Epic"" film (although the true epics included thousands of extras and larger than life productions and with CGI none of that extravagance is necessary).  Gladiator is by no means a great film.  The plot is paper thin, the story lines moves from point A to B with unfaltering linearity, and the end battle is somewhat of a disappointment. With that said, however, Gladiator was incredible to watch, making the audience watch in amazement as bodies are sliced and diced in the gory arena battles.  Russell Crowe is great (per usual) as Maximus, lending credibility to some of the more ridiculous dialogue and Joaquin Phoenix is superb (again per usual) as the tortured Commodus (unfortunate name).  Y2K has not produced the great films of 1999 (American Beauty, Three Kings, Being John Malkovich) yet, but Gladiator is a nice try.",Gladiator
445,Rhino Rover,Awesome!,10,16 May 2000,"Wow! That's all I can say after watching ""Gladiator"". And you know what? I'm not writing this review immediately after watching the movie like I usually do. I'm writing this review after watching the movie for the SECOND time. Yep, I saw this movie on opening night and then went and saw it again two days later.Gladiator is about a Roman General who's a hero that becomes a slave, then becomes a gladiator, and finally a hero again. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) refuses to support the young Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) as he suspects foul play after it is discovered that the current Emperor and father to Commodus is found dead. Maximus becomes an outcast and eventually a slave as he is bought by Proximo, a man who engages in the sport of gladiating by supplying the slaves that will eventually be killed in these gruesome competitions. To Proximo's surprise, Maximus not only survives competition after competition but he becomes the favorite in almost every competition. But there's more to this man's success than skill alone. There's revenge.Russell Crowe is not one of the better-known actors but he's fast becoming one. I saw him in ""Insider"" and was blown away with his performance there but when I saw this movie I gained an even deeper respect for this man. He is one talented actor. The rest of the cast is no sack of potatoes either. This is probably one of the most talented group of actors assembled for one film.Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Dereck Jacobi, the list goes on and it's hard to find a weak actor in the group. I was particularly impressed with Joaquin Phoenix. I thought he played the young Emperor with a wonderful mix of child-like poutiness and scheming villany that was a good counterpart to Crowe's character. Connie Nielsen's portrayal of Commodus's sister, Lucilla, was equally well done and at times made you feel a bit uncomfortable as the hint of an incestuous relationship between her and Commodus possibly existed.The good thing about this movie was that there was a good storyline to backup the strong cast. The dialogue was appropriate to the story and unlike many of the other ""testosterone"" filled movies, this one didn't suffer the fate of cheezy lines.Overall, a definite must see but I must warn you. There is a tremendous amount of graphic violence so if you're faint of heart this may not be the movie for you. If this sort of thing doesn't bother you, you must go see it. For your information, the real Commodus did participate in gladiating and was rumored to have amassed a record of 1000 wins so he was no slouch in the gladiating ring.",Gladiator

However, there is no Biblical references in this one and it is much darker than the classics (in particularly Spartacus) which it has been moulded around.  Like those films it is truly spectacular (special effects are at their best when you can hardly notice them) and has perfect actors playing memorable actors.  There are some truly touching scenes (especially the last one) and others are fast, furious and blood-wrenched. All in all, Gladiator is a hugely impressive film which brings an old genre back to life and gives it an added dimension.  It will probably spawn a few imitators but this original will end up a classic.",Gladiator
453,tripwires,Spectacular in every way,8,13 August 2001,"I must admit, when I saw the trailer, I thought it was another crap period movie; I didn't like period dramas a lot back then. But after I became a fan of Joaquin Phoenix's, I watched it on a VCD, 5 months after it was released in the theatre. And I truly could not understand why the trailer turned me off so much. Besides Joaquin's brilliant and Oscar-robbed performance as Commodus, Gladiator has all the right ingredients of a spectacular epic, beginning with the opening battle scene. I firmly believe that it is filmed ""shaky"" to convey the confusion and madness in a battle, and not because the guy behind the camera didn't know how to use one. Yes, it contains blood and gore and all that jazz, but do not forget it's a movie about gladiators. Gladiators back then did not sit around, drinking tea and eating sandwiches; they did almost exactly what was depicted in the fights scenes in the film. How else were the film-makers to portray the violence of gladiator fights than to include it in the movie?Another good thing about ""Gladiator"" is that its villain is very much 3-dimensional. I am a big fan of Joaquin Phoenix, and I strongly believe he deserved that Best Supporting Actor Oscar no matter what people say. How often do you get a villain in an action movie who isn't portrayed as entirely bad? Phoenix played Commodus not as a mere villain, but as a spoiled child whose intense search for love drove him to commit deeds he'd later regret (as seen in one of the deleted scenes in the DVD). He gave Commodus a depth that isn't found in most action-movie villain (for example the bad guy in ""Kiss of the Dragon""), and drove the audience into grudging sympathy mixed with loathe. For that alone, he deserves the Oscar.Connie Nielson also deserved some sort of recognition for her underrated performance as Lucilla. She handled her role with great dignity and care; her confliction between her love for her brother that's slowly fading and her duty towards her country is very clearly put across, giving Lucilla the conviction that is certainly needed.Gladiator also has a magnificent score that is, again, Oscar-worthy. The music gives the picture the extra push that sends emotions into overdrive, particularly the **spoiler** Patricide scene, the opening battle scene and the very last scene. The special effects were ASTOUNDING! Just take a look at the Colosseum! Perhaps I'm over-sensitive, but I felt like I was being transported right back to that period.""Gladiator"" is certainly meant to be seen on the big screen. Due to its second release, I had a chance to do just that. And what an experience. Contrary to what some has said, ""Gladiator"" WILL be remembered some ten years from now, simply because it's an epic film about the Roman empire. And a spectacular one at that.",Gladiator

The story line is fairly strong and most of the performances are reasonable but I was not impressed with the special effects. The special effects in my opinion did not enhance my enjoyment of the film indeed they had a negative effect on me. On my initial viewing I was also not at all impressed with the leading man. Russell Crowe in my opinion was given far too much praise for his performance. Joaquin Phoenix was adequate and some of the other performances were OK but in my opinion there was more than one person miscast in this film and overall this is not a good combination. I am not at all interested and never have been that I may be the only one who happens to be a dissenting voice. I will not be watching this film again because its not good enough to hold my attention and it does not have sufficient quality.

457,dima-12,As good as a concept movie gets/a perfect Verhoeven pic shot by Ridley Scott,7,30 May 2000,"`Gladiator` is the symbol of Hollywood`s renewed intrest in medieval subjects and stories.Since techno-thriller self-destructed under the burden of Hollywood`s commercial expectations enchant history became the new well of ideas for moguls.This is why `The 13th Warrior` hit the silver screen and why `Joan of Arc` got funding from Hollywood.`Gladiator` takes as back to the past when Western Civilisation wasn`t as great as we know it since the majority of people weren`t aware that there is only one God. `Gladiator` is the story of the Roman general Maximus who gets involved in royal plots during the time of Marcus Aurelius` reign.Because of his position he gets punished but he escapes death.Unfortunately his family gets slaughtered and he becomes a slave that ends up as a gladiator in Roman Arena.In Rome Maximus plots to avenge his family`s death and to take Roman Empire back to the right path. `Gladiator` is a competent return to`swords and sandals` mythology and the movie doesn`t fail where it`s predecesors did.It is expensive,large-scale story with great actors.Performances of Russell Crowe and Oliver Reed are especially enjoyable and Joaquin Phoenix really gives edge to the character of Commodus,the villain Emperor.Russell Crowe iz amazing and his acting really fits the epic scale of characters behaving and tragedy. Since `L.A.Confidential` it was obvious that Crowe is `the next big thing` and he finally proved it again in `Gladiator`. The script has fine moments but it is generally routine stuff.It isn`t edgy but it does make mistakes concerning history.I mean I ain`t no historian but authors avoid the religious aspect of the plot.Even though Crowe prays to one God while the young `Replacement Emperor` and his sister use plural in religious conversations. The ending is a nice idea but it is bad written and bad writing includes cheesy lines spoken by `as hard as it gets` Crowe. `Gladiator` also features a supportng role Djimon Hounsou the `Dream Works SKG nigger`(remember him in `Amistad` also made by `Dream Works SKG`?). Ridley Scott`s direction is mature and atractive and he proves true the thing Michael Mann said about him to Crowe(Mann said that Scott is among top two percent of shooters in business).His direction is inspired in visual sense and thus he gives us some hot sword  fighting and animal action.The shots of Arena in all it`s glory are impressive and kudos also go to cinematographer John Mathieson who shot Kevin Allen`s masterpiece `Twin Town`.Ridley Scott can`t avoid the classic `Dream Works SKG` blueish colour orientation but this is a legit landmark of the studio.... Overall `Gladiator` is a must-see not because of it`s substance but because of the fact that it interprets some of the classic myths of human culture in the manner of a 100-million studio picture which is fine. I hope that great box-office result of this movie would boost production of such anticipated projects like Michael Mann`s `Spartans` with George Clooney and Verhoeven`s `Crusade` with Arnold Scwarzenegger. If Verhoeven had directed `Gladiator` it would have been a masterpiece.",Gladiator

The characters are as flat as cardboxes and as interesting to watch as looking at the thermometer going up.  When Commodus said to Maximus (gee, Maximus; what an original name) that he ravished his wife repeatedly, it was a point that the audiences should feel anger.  But, instead of me feeling angry towards the bad guy, I let loose with a big, gaping yawn.The victory of Gladiator at the Oscars only shows the current, sorry state of American filmmaking.  Pathetic movies disguised with coating candy, like American Pie, Road Trip, and that Tom Green movie.  Ridley Scott should stick to making his Alien flicks.  So if you want a boring pile of action trash that happens to win Oscars, which it can have Van Damme as it's main lead and it wouldn't matter anyway, go and see Gladiator.(PS: a better alternative would be ""Spartacus"" which is a way, way better film - trust me on this)",Gladiator

Hollywood long ago stopped awarding films that have any merit and only award films that make them money. Even saying that, to give this insipid junk any kind of recognition proves beyond a shadow of a doubt, that the academy awards are a pathetic farce.

After having been betrayed and his family murdered by the new Roman emperor, Maxiumus vows vengeance that will achieve by any cost, and must do so as a Roman gladiator.One of the finest films of its generation and one in which made Russell Crowe a star. Brilliantly acted and directed with awe inspiring action sequences with weight behind them. The viewer will feel for Crowe's plight within this film, as the pacing and story are top notch. The set pieces as well as the wardrobe and mentality of the film are extremely Roman and feel authentic as anything real in this modern age. A film that was nominated and one in which will not only grip the viewer from beginning to end but resonate with the viewer for some time to come. The action sequence are authentic and very tense as is intended. The musical score is heroic and filled with epic grandeur that only further strengthen the film. Many consider this film an epic and one in which still to this day hold up to the test of time. This film as well was Oliver Reed's last film as he passed away during the filming process. Gladiator is an awe inspiring, swords and sandals film that hold back no punches in its action, its pacing or its storytelling.

462,Steven Reynolds,George Lucas take note,9,12 May 2000,"Marvelously directed and spectacularly shot, ""Gladiator"" is an aural and visual feast from beginning to end.  But it's more than that.  It's a powerfully moving story which, despite the 154 minute running time, is economically written and very simply told.  I've seen it three times and it just keeps getting better.George Lucas should see this film about three hundred times before he shoots the first frame of ""Episode 2"".  ""Gladiator"" is everything his disastrous ""Episode 1"" should have been: a great political story with lots of sword play, that still manages to be big on family values and which, most importantly, uses special effects FOR A NARRATIVE PURPOSE and not for their own sake.  From the extraordinary opening battle sequence, to the spectacular recreations of Rome - and what looks suspiciously like a digitally-resurrected Oliver Reed in one or two shots - Ridley Scott deploys the special effects with sensitivity, purpose and elan.  He uses them to TELL the story.  With Lucas, they ARE the story.If I were Lucas I'd be handing over the ""Episode 2"" writing duties to Messrs Franzoni, Logan and Nicholson, and only keeping the director's chair warm until Mr Scott wraps on ""Hannibal"".

464,tsf-1962,C.B. would be proud,10,21 November 2006,"It's a shame Cecil B. DeMille is no longer with us. If he were alive today he would be gratified to see that the type of movies he loved to make are popular again: ""Gladiator,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl"" and ""The Passion of the Christ"" are all the kinds of movies DeMille made; all of them are movies he would have made if the screenplays had been around in his day. ""Gladiator"" is a gloriously retro sword-and-sandal epic, a cross-pollination of ""Spartacus,"" ""Ben Hur,"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire""; director Ridley Scott uses modern CGI technology to make the kind of movie they don't make any more. Although not 100% historically accurate, it's irresistible drama. Russell Crowe is one of the few actors today who can pull off this kind of heroic role; he has the gravitas despite his bad-boy reputation in real life that blond pretty boys like Brad Pitt and Colin Farrell can never hope to approach. Connie Nielsen is a sensuous presence as Lucilla; River Phoenix as Commodus is the creepiest villain since Ralph Fiennes' Amos Goetz in ""Schindler's List""; and the supporting cast is full of stand out performances. It's good to see ""I Claudius""'s Derek Jacobi back in toga; what's an epic without Richard Harris? and of course Oliver Reed as the lovably irascible slave-trader Proximo, who proves not to be such a bad guy after all. The film completely ignores the persecution of Christians under the otherwise humane Marcus Aurelius; but then, ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" ignores the presence of slavery in the eighteenth-century West Indies.",Gladiator

Russell simply shines because that's what he has to do.All said his Maximus is one of the most, vibrant figures in film-making history along side Gables' ""Rhett Butler"", Yul Bryners'""The King Of Siam"", Sidney Poitier's ""Sir"" in To Sir With Love and Morgan Freemans' ""Red"" in The Shawshank Redemption.

467,mercury-26,When In Rome...,9,12 May 2000,"The tag line for this film is `A Hero Will Rise.' Ain't that the truth. Make no mistake, Dreamworks' promotion for Gladiator has the principle purpose of launching this guy to the top of the Hollywood A-list. `Can we get Russell Crowe?' will soon be the number one question asked in production offices across Tinseltown. Looks like filmmakers have finally found a performer who is the Real Deal as it were. I mean, the intensity of his performances evoke true toughness: you feel like you'd trust the guy with your life. Can you now or could you ever say that about Costner? Cage? Keanu? Arnold? Crowe is here to stay and puts the hero back into movie heroics.His new film is another good story in the vein of ""Braveheart""-not a bad blueprint to follow. The reservations I have about ""Gladiator"" all come from the familiarity of some of the scenes. The whole hero of the people' thing it's got going; the retelling of the ages-old story of the struggle against totalitarianism. Here is another one, a good one, set in a time and place we haven't seen depicted in cinema for quite some time. The film uses its height-of-the-Roman Empire setting well and delivers on the promise of action and adventure. Set in the last days of the good Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), the film takes on the familiar subject of a World Power worrying a little too much about its neighbors and not tending to its own growing problems at home. In the opening scene, Marcus watches his powerful Roman army, led by his general and respected friend Maximus (Crowe), tear into a rebelling army of Germanic barbarians. This opening scene is a huge, loud, impressive spectacle that the movie never really tops. The Emperor would like to pass along rule of the Empire to Maximus, which comes as disturbing news to Marcus' disgraceful son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Commodus sees to it that his father's dying wish is not carried out, and promptly orders Maximus executed. From here on, bad things happen to Maximus and to Rome, with the evil nervous wreck Commodus behind it all.Maximus, thought dead by the new Emperor, is sold into slavery and trained to fight in the gladiator' games, the entertainment choice of the times until they were abolished by Marcus Aurelius. Commodus, however, brings the games back. In the past, gladiators who could win over the crowds in the Colosseum would earn their freedom. Maximus has something else to fight for-revenge. Director Ridley Scott (""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner,"" ""Thelma and Louise,"" ""G.I. Jane"") stages the arena scenes with pure entertainment in mind, just as the real things were. The whole idea of the games was to re-enact in a way, great wars fought and won by Rome. So here is Maximus, as a gladiator, pretending to be a soldier in an army he had likely conquered as a general in real life. This is when Maximus' character really gets under our skin. A lesser person might wallow in the obvious humiliation of his situation, but Maximus doesn't. He finds every opportunity to use it for the benefit of himself and his estranged countrymen. The story is so strong that these arena scenes become simply pieces of the whole that help to propel things forward. Scott never succumbs to the temptation of showing any more brutality than is necessary.Joaquin Phoenix creates a truly loathsome human being in Commodus. This is the kind of twitchy, insecure kid a father would keep his daughter miles away from and here he is in charge of the world's greatest empire. The casting of Phoenix; along with Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi, Djimon Hounsou, Oliver Reed, and of course Crowe, shows that Gladiator's creators preferred substance over style.The casting, the photography, the writing-all of these things seem to have been given great care. The result is what will probably end up being one of the year's best films.Grade: B",Gladiator

There was a only one part of this movie, that really got to me. And that was heartless merciless murder of his family. I broke into tears, but despite that depressing scene.

471,robsellke,"Excellent story, vivid characters, awesome fight scenes",10,26 June 2000,"""Gladiator"" is one of those truly memorable films.  The story is harrowing, the bad guys are truly evil, and the heroes are heroic.  Russell Crowe plays Maximus, a former general in the Roman Army, and a favorite of the late emperor, Marcus Aurelius(Richard Harris).  When Aurelius tells his son, Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix), and heir to the throne, that he will not be choosing him as his successor, but Maximus, Commodus kills Aurelius and has Maximus sentenced to die.  Commodus rises to power and has Maximus's family condemned to die as well.  Maximus escapes his executioners and heads to his home in Spain to save his family.  The Romans get there first, though, and Maximus's family is crucified.  Maximus collapses at their graves and is taken prisoner by a slave trader.  The slave trader sells him to an entertainer, who has Maximus trained as a gladiator.  Maximus is incredible in the ring, and is taken to Rome to fight in the just re-opened Coliseum. I can't tell you any more without spoiling the story, though.  The acting is excellent, and the viewer really begins to hate Commodus by the end of the film, and love and admire Maximus.  The cinematography is good as well, with vivid colors and breathtaking shots.  This is truly a great fight movie.",Gladiator

Russell Crowe is not the best choice for the role of gladiator. Most of the movie he mumbles in his chin so you cannot understsnd the half of what he's saying. Maybe if he spoke Latin, we would understand him better. It's too distracting.Also, movie is kinda 'good vs bad' which makes it flat and boring. One of the main characters, Lucilla is a tragic but too pretentious character so you cannot sympathise with her neither.The main character is general turned gladiator, but the actor is too chubby and fat to play such a character. Soldiers and especially gladators in the anciant Roman Empire were the 3% body fat type of people, with limited access to food and all day hard trainings. This guy came out of war chubby and even when he became gladiator he still remained chubby after all that torture and hard training. It's confusing. Actor for that role cannot be 'all you can eat 24/7 buffer' type of person. Another proof that this is miss cast.Only good thing in the movie is scenography, Roman amphiteater in particular.

Non-stop action keeps the adrenaline pumping, the portrayal of the characters makes us see what the director and writer wants us to see, and a story that keeps us coming for more.Russell Crowe does an excellent job in his portrayal of Maximus, a man cut down from a general to a slave, and then became more powerful than the emperor, exactly as the tag-line says. His despair over the death of his family and the future he's denied, his disgust over the games, and his quest for vengeance when he finds the man who killed his family and his close friend.Joaquin Phoenix also does a marvelous job for Commodus. Successfully showing him as a spoiled rich boy lusting for more power, and viewing his as someone not to be feared, but pitied.Even though Oliver Reed died before he could shoot some very important scenes, they flawlessly brought him back from the dead digitally to say his final words, ""Shadows and Dust,"" from a test shoot earlier making the approach of the climax even more gripping.Alien, Blade Runner, and now Gladiator.

474,LaurieMann,"Worst ""Best Picture Oscar"" since ""The Last Emporer""",6,8 April 2001,"This movie is just such a mess, that last year must have been a worse year for movies than I'd realized.  That said, Traffic is head and shoulders in quality beyond this silly toga movie.There are little scenes in this movie that do not relate to ANYTHING - most notably, the scene near the end where someone puts a poisonous snake in a bed.  The viewers are lead to believe that a certain traitor was being killed; the set-up about Cleopatra had been made in the previous scene.  But nothing happens - the character is clearly alive later.The scenes involving war crib from the best - Rashoman and Henry V, with music stolen from Holsts' The Planets.  The gladiator scenes steal from Spartacus (with more gore, of course; Spartacus, made over 40 years ago, is a vastly superior movie despite Tony Curtis' problems with acting).  The Collesium scenes use many shots from Ben Hur.The performances are all over the place.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed (whose ruminations on death in the movie are all the more eerie since he died during the filming) are terrific. Russell Crowe is pretty good, but not great.  His best scenes are during his general days early in the movie.  But Juanquin Phoenix and, to a degree, Connie Nielsen feel like they are in a completely different movie.Some of the photography and most of the CGI work (except when they attempted to animate a tiger) is quite good.  The animated tigers intercut with real tigers showed the CGI isn't perfect because the perspective is extremely flat when the animated tigers are used.This movie is an ambitious disappointment.  It is very much like Ben Hur in that it has flashes of brilliance but is undercut by a surprisingly awkward script.  On the whole, I'll take Ben Hur and Spartacus for great cinema about Rome.",Gladiator

The Romans, on the other hand, loved torture and bloodsports; watching Christians being torn apart by lions or fierce gladiator fights to the death. The premise in this movie involved the murder of emperor Marcus Aurelius - a philosopher in his own right - by his son. One problem - he was not murdered, rather dying of the plague in (what is now) Vienna.Russell Crowe plays a general who had served under Marcus Aurelius and vows revenge against his ""murderous"" son and to instate his last wish; to hand the power of Rome back to the senate. Even though this never happened in real life, this plot device drives Crowe's character to exact revenge against the ""murderer"" of his master. Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) was also strangled to death in his bath by Narcissus basically because he was a vain, masochistic character.So know this information before you watch this film.

A commander of the Roman Armies and a surrogate son to a dying Roman Emperor, Maximus just wants to return home.  He has seen too much of war.In his humility, he declines his dying Emperor's wishes for him to take the throne, and leaves the boon to the Emperor's spoiled rotten son, Commodus (of which Joaquin Phoenix gives a tour-de-force performance.)Because of his jealousy over his father's love, Commodus is sick with envy over Maximus's importance.  In his ignorance, he makes Maximus the main attraction of his new Collusium in Rome, where the warrior, now gladiator, must face death and thrill the crowds -- in turn, making him to be a legend beyond his own Imperial name.With fine acting, a wonderful screenplay and excitement galore, this movie captivates.",Gladiator

The story was engrossing and the performances were first rate.Russell Crowe is solid as the heroic Roman general who suffers at the hand of Commodus, the ambitious and ruthless emperor's son (Joaquin Pheonix). Richard Harris has a wonderful turn as the dying emperor who loves Maximus as his own. The late Oliver Reed is perfect as the slaver ""businessman."" But the one performance that may be overlooked in this rich masterpiece is that of Connie Nielsen as the emperor's daughter, Lucilla. Nielsen's use of expressions as well as words to convey her character's moods is excellent.Some of the violence, though necessary, may be hard to take for the squeamish, but I thought it was not overdone, as is the case in lesser movies with violent themes.

489,The_Other_Snowman,Rote Revenge Pic Poses as Historical Epic,6,4 August 2008,"""Gladiator"", winner of the Best Picture Academy Award in 2001, is less a historical epic of swords, sandals, and the fate of a mighty empire, and more of a bloated B-movie about a guy with a gloomy face seeking revenge for the murder of his family. ""Death Wish"" in Ancient Rome, if you will.Thanks to director Ridley Scott it's a very pretty picture to look at: the icy blue light of a wintry Germanic battlefield, the amber hue of the emperor's throne room, and the Coliseum littered with rose petals like confetti. The many gruesome gladiatorial fight scenes are frenetically paced, visceral if not actually coherent. Some of the modern special effects, however, like the CGI cityscapes, look a bit crude, even by 1999's standards.The script, like most of the scripts that Ridley Scott works from, is strictly rough-draft material. The characters are shallow, the dialogue is stilted and awkward, and the story tries too hard to intertwine the drama of the Roman political arena with the action of the hero's central journey in the more literal arena -- the former scenes only serve as breathing room between the latter scenes, which are the real meat of the film. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix make the most out of their limited roles -- Crowe's terse delivery and brooding eyes establish his character better than the writer ever could -- but veterans Richard Harris and Oliver Reed nearly vanish into parts that ask too little of their great talents.In the end it doesn't feel like a proper epic: it's not the sort of epoch-defining story that spans years and continents and a huge historical canvas, like ""Ben-Hur"" or ""Spartacus"" were -- or Anthony Mann's ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" which told essentially the same story in 1964. It's not even ""Braveheart"", another gory, overblown revenge flick. It's trying to be big and important, but it has nothing important to say; its only purpose is to construct a framework for swordfights.",Gladiator

491,bluzman,Another big budget variation on a well-worn theme,6,25 February 2001,"Gladiator is well-made and sports all the frills of a big budget production -- big sets and lotsa extras in good costumery.  However, let's be blunt, it is a 10-minute plot stretched out to epic proportions.  And, it is not a new plot.  It is not much more than a combination of Braveheart and Last of the Mohicans, go to Rome -- to name a couple of more recent films. In effect, it is hero gets done wrong and his loved ones are killed, so he bides his time and gets his revenge. I think all of the hurrah behind this film is from Hollywood having little else to offer this year at the Oscars (how else could Chocolat get nominated --$$$). Since Crouching Tiger is not part of the good ole boy Hollywood network, Hollywood is working hard to prevent a foreign film from upstaging them. In a different year, this film would not get half the recognition it is getting.",Gladiator

I think Russell Crowe did a good job and Joaquin Phonix did a good job. This movie great acting, great writing, great cinematography, great sets and great costumes. This movie had great battle sequences. This film won an Oscar for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Sound, Best Costume Design, and Best Visual Effects. It got nominated for Best Supporting Actor - Joaquin Phonix, Best Art Direction - Arthur Max, Best Original Score - Hans Zimmer and Best Cinematography - John Mathison. I like other Ridley Scott films including Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma & Louise and Black Hawk Down.",Gladiator
493,shattenjager777,"The three good points of ""Gladiator""",2,15 June 2003,"1.  Derek Jacobi: I love Derek Jacobi and he is one of the world's most brilliant actors. However, seeing him perform in such a lowbrow, low-class, low-quality movie is disturbing.  It's a bit like seeing John Cleese in James Bond films or Kenneth Branagh in ""Wild Wild West.""  It's sad, really.2.  Sets and costuming: This film is visually stunning. I suppose Ridley Scott has to be given credit for his work here instead of being blamed for a bad script.3.  It ends (and this one takes far too long to happen)   ""Gladiator"" is almost as over-hyped as ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Titanic"" in the pantheon of bad movies that somehow convinced idiots that they were good. Russell Crowe's performance is decent, but how in the world can you win a best actor Oscar for playing a completely flat, empty character like Maximus?  Kevin Costner or Keanu Reeves can play a role this simple and do a decent job!  It is possible to add some depth to this character in performance, but Crowe seems incapable, unwilling, or unallowed to do this and thus instead plays this one-dimensional piece-of-paper role and somehow gets accolades for it.     However, the part of this film that kills it is the thing that truly makes or breaks a film:  the script.  A good script can make up for bad acting (as evidenced in ""JFK"" and ""The Matrix""), but good acting cannot make up for a truly bad script (as evidenced in ""Best in Show"" and ""Titanic""). ""Gladiator"" is a case of the latter.  Crowe doesn't give an amazing performance, but he is given little to work with.  In fact, the only actor who really does have a full character to work with is Joaquin Phoenix, and he performs it quite well.  The other characters hardly need acting, even though one is filled by the ever-brilliant Derek Jacobi.  The truth of the matter, though, is that the script is trite and stupid.  As a matter of fact, it's like a very ineloquent version of ""The Tragedy of King Richard III"" without the fascinating central character.  There is also far too much battling in this film.  I got bored with Kenneth Branagh's ""Henry V"" because of ONE long battle scene, but this film seems to have about five of that same length.  ""Gladiator"" is like all of these ""crime dramas"" that are really just action films with just enough plot for stupid people to think they are intelligent.     In sum, if you want to watch a typical, run-of-the-mill action film set in ancient Rome, watch this.  If you want to see nothing other than stunning visuals, watch this (though I would more suggest that you watch anything directed by Peter Weir if you want visuals).  However, if you want to see a movie worth watching, don't bother.",Gladiator
494,MyDarkStar,A solid Best Picture,7,2 March 2002,"For all of the awards and money that went to this movie, this movie is still not regarded very highly by the online movie community (usenet groups etc..).There are several reasons for this. One is that it was in contention for Best Picture against some extremely well made movies : ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" ; ""Traffic"". These are some really incredible movies as well. All three of the movies are deserving of the Best Picture Award. The two losing movies have since become cult classics in their own right, with a very strong following.Another reason that some have played it down is because it SO many Awards. The one that seemed to bother people the most was Russell Crowe's Best Actor Award. Many felt his role was simply physical, and not too difficult to portray.These are valid points in their own right. However, I have viewed ""Gladiator"" many times on cable. It is practically on every other day. With these viewings, I have noticed that the film has a great amount of staying power. There are many great performances in this movie. Joaquin Phoenix's performance is his best without a doubt.So many other elements (which it of course won awards for) will suck you into this movie again and again. I was never a fan of ""Gladiator"". Frankly, I liked ""Traffic"" better. However, I still find myself watching it when it is on - and every time I watch it there is something new that I like.I believe in 5-10 years many people who believe ""Gladiator"" didn't deserve all of the awards it garnished will also realize that you have to view ""Gladiator"" for what it is : a gigantic epic with an enormous amount of elements to be appreciated after many viewings.",Gladiator
495,DesertDogMedia,Gladiator,7,11 August 2014,"Title: GladiatorCondensed Storyline: A Roman general is betrayed by the emperor's son who kills his family, so he must come back to Rome to exact revenge Notable Acting: Russell Crowe plays Maximus and gives a good believable performance and suits the part. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus and is a great villain, but he's also that type of villain you would know will get killed. You wait through the entire movie just to see that scene where he does get killed. That is a great villain. Costume: Maximus' costume is historically accurate an looks the part, along with the outfits of many other in this movie. Incorrect History: The locks shown in the movie had not bee invented at that time. Some of the helmets shown in the gladiator room are from countries north of Rome, such has French, German and Nordic. A horse pulling a chariot wouldn't also have a saddle on. Thumbs up or down for life or death is incorrect, it is actually thumb to the side for death and a fist for death. The opening battle is incorrect as a Roman legion's formation wouldn't break down on contact with the enemy, they would force them back. Medieval knights invented the flail, 1000 years or so after this movie is set.Overall Feel: This movie isn't without its historical errors, and it does have a few. But that doesn't stop it from being a down right great movie to watch, the scale of the movie is perfect. The casting is good. The camera work is meh, but this is made up to us through the great story that we watch",Gladiator
496,spaulagain,Proof a perfect film is not flawless,10,21 September 2020,"While Gladiator is traditional (if not basic) in its overall plot, the characters and performances bring the trophy home in this film. Beautifully shot, with just the right amount of violence and emotion, it's a good technical film as well. Some may find parts of it to be a little cheesy, or some of the side characters to just be meh, those flaws are greatly overshadowed by the leads.Crowe is fantastic of course, but Joaquin Phoenix steals the film with an incredible performance as Commodus. From his first scene, to the last, you build an intense hate for his character. His creepy nature just rubs it all in.This was the first film I saw (when it came out) that I then knew of Phoenix's skills and potential. He's been a favorite ever since.",Gladiator

Yes, there was some of all those things, but what also came off the screen was an absorbing story of a man's determination to bring his life full circle -- make it complete by avenging those who had wronged him.  The computer generated effects were far above those of TITANIC and the work done in the battle scenes was simply awe-inspiring.  I had a few quibbles: the relationship between Drucilla and Maximus prior to the opening of the movie was not explained and the speed of the opening battle varied from slow to fast and it was hard to keep an eye on any one person.  Very minor things!  I spent $4.75 to see the movie and it was WELL WORTH IT!  I think I've recovered from the belly flop that was TITANIC.  I can now go to a theatre and spend my money with confidence.  There ARE good movies out there!",Gladiator
498,n_r_koch,Gladiator nearly killed by writing,8,23 March 2009,"Everything's better now. The acting, the photography, the sound, the editing, the costumes (Roman indigo too, not purple), the effects and the art design. The action sequences, the location work. OK, there are some anachronisms and the history is fictionalized, and the stunts were impressive in the 1920s too. Still, everything's better now. Except the writing.If Charlton Heston, Yul Brinner, and Anne Baxter were reading this film's dialogue you would hear how dreadful it really is. It's a tribute to modern actors like Crowe and Phoenix that they can make even things like ""I shall have my vengeance-- in this life or the next!"" sound as if someone might say them, somewhere, ever. Try it! This fight between quality actor and poor script is fought out within nearly every contemporary Hollywood blockbuster. Why? How much does a joke cost? Do audiences accept this as good writing? Why don't they demand better? To prove all this: watch the DVD with the sound off and the subtitles on. Yes, that's how hard Crowe and the rest had to work. THis movie deserves a 6 (a 9 with a -3 for the writing), but it gets an 8 because the actors are able to put the banalities over and make it sound convincing.",Gladiator

500,dragonshield,"A massive epic, Ridley Scott's work of art - Simply a masterpiece",9,15 August 2007,"""Gladiator"" is, to me, one of the best films ever made, probably even in my personal Top 10 Movies of All Time -list. It's a massive epic motion picture that pleases your eyes and ears with effective visuality, drama, romance and more. The story tells about a Roman general Maximus who gets betrayed by an evil prince. By the acts of the prince, Maximus's family gets murdered and he wanders into sorrow where tears won't be spared. He then finds himself captured to become a gladiator among other slaves, but he still seeks for revenge. Maximus tries to keep himself alive in battles which he is forced into, only that he might someday take his revenge against the evil prince. The story has so much more in it, but I'll just leave the rest of it for the viewers, as I certainly do not want to give away any spoilers.Like I already said, the story is simply fantastic. It's so deep and touching, being very original at the same time. Despite of the movie being a massive epic one it still isn't cliché at all, it just maintains the level of drama in a level that doesn't go over the top. It has a nice flow too and there is no boring scene in any part of the movie, every scene matters and every scene is significant in its own way, that's just how incredible the storytelling is. The building of the main character, the whole theme from victorious to sad, from sad to anger and from anger to a satisfying ending, everything goes like it's supposed to. The creation of the world has been achieved terrificly well; The sets, the dressing, all the details, basically everything. Although there was a lot of CGI used in the creation of the world, the CGI department deserves a big plus on making everything so believable and realistic. Everything looks smooth and soothing, just the way you want it to look like. You can't complain, really.What comes to role performances, well, in my opinion Russell Crowe does an absolutely phenomenal role performance as Maximus. The anger, the sorrow, all the expressions and body language, just great. I don't care if Crowe is an asshole in real life, because whatever they say in the press he still is an amazing actor. He has actually become one of my favourite actors because of his past role performances, he is just everything a director wants from an actor, performing every role flawlessly. He does have that sort of a rough appearance, but he can play a nice guy too. What comes to other role performances there is one more to mention; Joaquin Phoenix. To be honest, I've never liked Phoenix that much, don't know why, but I have to admit that he is too an amazing actor. As the evil prince Commodus he is that brilliant fierce himself again, a perfect actor for an evil role.This is by far Ridley Scott's best film yet to date and when Hans Zimmer's music is put on top of the cake you just can't go wrong with that. The directing is superb and the music is magnificent. Like mentioned above the directing consists of mixtures of genres; Drama, romance, adventure and action. Every department is handled in superior way, in a way that leaves your notebook blank on the side of the faults the movie would suffer from. The music has this main theme in it, which is beautifully composed, including that beauty and also thrill and intensity. ""Gladiator"" is all in all a tremendous motion picture which everyone should see, a born legend some could say. Fantastic story, phenomenal role performance by the lead actor, superb directing and beautiful music; All this compile a film that I can't imagine to be a disappointment to anyone, a definite 9 out of 10.",Gladiator
501,berberian00-276-69085,Oliver Reed as Generational Actor,10,12 September 2013,"I was wondering how to arrange my train of thoughts about actor Oliver Reed.""Gladiator"" (2000) was his last film and though sacrifice should be made not to speak for the movie itself, I still insist of paying tribute to the Actor with this shot which sent him to grave just like many other times he was binging and filming. I read his authorized biography from Virgin Books and was amazed at his extraordinary practices to absorb industrial amounts of alcohol at no costs to his health. I myself can not afford this habit any more though sometime we used to drink and party a lot. I also brood on the fact how people change with age and their zeal for life also.By calling Oliver Reed generational actor I mean the following. These actors appear on the big screen as stars once in a decade, usually in tuples, brought as product by great nations or at least big enough to form a pool. Thus France gave to the cinema in the 60s and 70s Alain Delon and Jean-Paul Belmondo. Unscathingly, here in this movie Reed is paired with Richard Harris - in the role of Emperor Marcus Aurelius - who also happens to be manifesto actor that together with the titular and couple of more fellows created the image of British adventure cinema for 20 years. At least thus appears to me as compared British to American born film stars. So we are talking here about weightlifters to be more precise.Now I want to link the persona of Oliver Reed to a former Bulgarian buff called Kliment Denchev (d. 2009) - an immigrant to Canada from the 1980s. I remember that corpulent man for several reasons not the least that he had physical resemblance to Oliver which I put two-and-two together recently. That Kliment Denchev left Bulgaria for political reasons few people in that former communist country would remember or are willing to. What I recently read about his case was that he deliberately got shunned by the State Security organs and forced to live abroad with his wife as fugitive. I remember this giant of a man from his performances in the 1970s when he was leading in the children's nightly at 19.45 PM two times a week. He also participated in many Bulgarian cult films before he left for overseas.Returning back to Oliver Reed. I shouldn't indulge anyone reading my preferences for him; he had enough fame and many critics. Women also loved him and I want to give a separate estimate for three of his films where he treated the opposite sex in his particular way:1. Trap (1966) - Rita Tushingham, whom I took mistakenly for Geraldine Chaplin, plays a mute that is bought by fur trapper to attend. But they are stalked by Indians in the remote cabin and Oliver loses his leg in a wolf-trap by accident. The young girl finally understands what hard life means and returns to his lame master;2. Hunting Party (1971) - Candice Bergen, a rancher's wife and schoolteacher, makes threesome with Oliver when he and his gang kidnap her for ransom. At first she is very resistant to the abductors but afterwards Oliver feeds her with peaches and she agrees to teach him lessons in gramercy. Subsequently they fall in love but unfortunately the rancher (Gene Hackman) organize a posse that exterminate the whole gang with long range rifle. At the end the three of them die in the desert;3. Castaway (1986) - Amanda Donohoe, who actually became a celebrity with this movie, plays an unemployed secretary that agrees to become female companion for one year on uninhabited island in the Pacific. The film contains limited amount of nudity for which received complaints from the critics. However, Oliver takes care of business and they survive amidst the wilderness until end of time. Sort of ""Blue Lagoon"" film for grown-ups. So long and Thank You!",Gladiator
502,Time Tripper,The movie is way over-rated!,6,6 May 2000,"Several excellent action sequences and a strong performance by Russell Crowe can not make up for a movie that's too long.  The excitement of the film is front loaded, and all the interesting points of the film are exhausted by the middle of the film.  A lot of time is wasted with countless redundant scenes establishing and re-establishing that (1) the new emperor is a spoiled insecure rodent, and (2) ""gee, things would sure be swell if Rome was a Republic again!""  The emperor's conspiring sister is played poorly by Connie Nielson, who couldn't act her way out of a high school play.  Joaquin Phoenix spends most of his time trying to pull off being demented but comes across just looking bitter. This movie is worth the money if you're looking for exciting fight scenes, but plan on making lots of trips to the concession stand during the dialogue scenes.  You can afford to miss them and still be able to figure out every single thing that's going on. *SPOILER WARNING* This film is total fiction, of course.  However, even in fiction there's a limit to believability.  For example, I hope the producers don't actually expect us to believe that after 25 years the emperor of Rome changes his mind about the morality of having an empire the day before he dies, or that the Roman Republic could have been restored in the second century by a single man!",Gladiator
503,m0rg16,Ridley Scott knows how to keep the audience interested.,9,18 August 2004,"I've always liked Ridley Scott. I like Alien and Blade Runner, and all of his other films (except for perhaps Black Hawk Down). And I'd have to say this is one of his better films. Simply because every aspect of the film comes together and creates a beautiful, interesting and thoughtful story of a roman general. Plus we get some awesome battle scenes.Maximus is a General in the Roman Army, in the year 180 A.D. He is leading the Roman armies to fight against the barbarian tribes of Germania. After all of Germania is conquered, Maximus looks forward to finally being able to go back home and seeing his wife and son again. But the Emperor has other duties for him. But before Maximus is able to perform those duties, the Emperor is killed and Maximus sentenced to death, by the Emperors own son: Commodus.Maximus manages to escape the clutches of Commodus but finds that Commodus also ordered the death of his family. Maximus is however captured and sold off as a gladiator, and finds himself in a situation where he must fight to survive. But his real goal is to get revenge on the man who killed his family: Commodus.The film is visually stunning. The battle scenes are awesome. The acting is superb. The script is excellent. Everything about this film is top-notch, but what can you expect from Ridley Scott? He directs the film like he knows exactly what he wants and the end result is something you'll want to watch over and over again. Russel Crowe is absolutely fabulous in the role as Maximus. He outdoes himself completely. You really care for his character, and in the end I always find that a tear rolls down my eye whenever the end credits roll across the scene. Oliver Reed (R.I.P) also gives us a great performance as the aged gladiator; Proximo. To bad he died before principal photography had ended, and had to be replaced by a CG Puppet in some scenes (altough I never noticed this while watching the film). Juaqin Phoenix also gives a stellar performance as the insidious and evil Emperor Commodus.The battle scenes are all great. My favorite is the battle between the Roman army and the Germanian tribes, which gives us some good IL' dirty warfare shots of people getting mutilated: The dark ages way. Other great scenes are when the gladiators are forced to play the part of the Barbarian horde in the re-enactment of the battle of Carthage. Hans Zimmers music in these scenes may very well be some of the best aggressive movie scores I've ever heard.All of this, combined with Ridley Scotts excellent visual style and superb directing, makes for a flawless film that should never be forgotten.10/10",Gladiator

Russel Crowe stars as a general, who is forced to fight in the arena as a Gladiator. There he enjoys success as the greatest gladiator. The film shows how betrayal can be destructive, and how the brave will conquer, while the coward will weep.The Film, besides all then awesome sets, costumes and acting, the Action Sequences are spectacular, and will definitely leave you entertained. Ridleys Scotts Greatest Epic, proves to be one of the greatest films of the 2000s, and probably the best film of 2000. Ridley Scott's direction is great.

505,LDB_Movies,"Lots of action, but little else...",7,26 May 2000,"Overall, Gladiator rates a 7 out of 10 for me. Russell Crowe, one of the best lead actors of our day, gives a thoughtful performance and lends the role of Maximus a depth it almost doesn't deserve. Joaquin Phoenix is a revelation - when the credits began to roll, I looked for the name of the unknown British actor who gave the role of the Emperor true believability, and I was surprised to see Joaquin's name. The rest of the supporting cast, including Oliver Reed and Richard Harris, were excellent. Unfortunately Connie Nielsen's portrayal of the Emperor's sister failed to hit the right notes.The effects are astounding, and the recreation of the Colliseum in Rome is awe-inspiring. My favorite scenes, however, were viewing the ""skyline"" of Rome itself from afar-- I don't think I've ever seen it so realistically portrayed-- I felt as if I were there.My main complaints lie in the movie's length (overly long at 2:30 and draggy in some parts) and the ""choppiness"" of the action scenes. At the beginning, that fast-action/slow motion technique DOES make you feel as if you are one of the warriors, but its repeated use eventually makes you a little nauseated. As a result, you come away from the movie not remembering what you really saw in the action scenes.The opening battle scene could have been called ""Saving Private Maximus"". And much of the repeated head-chopping reminds one of ""Braveheart"". But ""Gladiator"" doesn't live up to those superior films because it lacks the realism of Ryan's battle scenes, and the emotion of Braveheart.",Gladiator

The movie follows the rise and fall of Marcus Aurelius' (Caesar-Richard Harris) Greatest General Maximus Meridas (Russell Crowe) and then his rerise to power as not a general but a Gladiator fighting for his life in the Brutally Violent Colliseums of Rome.  While the movie is not historically accurate as far as story goes (the film never states its factual anyhow) its still a great piece of work by director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner).  Great musical score, cinematography, battle scenes and supporting cast.

General Maximus speaks such nonsense about troops, casualties etc. The massive battle in the movie would have been fine if they didn't have archers or catapults in the scene. After that, they should have used the scene in ""braveheart"", instead of a film about Romans.Remember that Roman army didn't charge into combat without controlled formations? Not considering this fact, the battle is the BEST part of the film. After this incident, the plot of the movie is sooooo predictable, as if the manuscript had been written by someone with the imagination of 12 year old child.Actors then...I have only seen worse acting performed by mr. Sylvester Stallone than the Aussie playing the role of Maximus. Even a wooden log could have put more feeling into the scene when he finds his family slaughtered. Besides, he rode a huge journey in one day, came to the smoking ruins of his villa from a distance of 1000 klicks (try that yourself).And the final scene: Emperor challenging a gladiator into a duel, how stupid is that?

508,serafinogm,Really good film with an opening battle scene that is incredible!,9,9 October 2015,"Loved this movie but the best sequence was at the beginning when the disciplined, methodical, Roman Army slaughtered a disorganized German horde in a filmed battle sequence with no equal other than perhaps the storming of Normandy beach from Spielberg's movie Saving Private Ryan! Tactics will beat brute force every time! The emperor overseeing this slaughter was Marcus Aurelius who was the last of the adoptive emperors, also referred to as the 'Good Emperors'. It started with Nerva, who adopted Trajan, who in turn adopted Hadrian, who was followed by Antoninus Pius who in turn was succeeded by Marcus Aurelius. During their rule there was a considerable expansion of the Roman empire, from northern Britain to Dacia and to Arabia and Mesopotamia, followed by a consolidation and an attempt to perfect the empire's defenses (e.g. Hadrian's Wall in Britain). This all started to unravel under Commodus (son of Marcus Aurelius). The period of the adoptive emperors started with the assassination of a horrible emperor (Domitian) and ended with another horrible emperor (Commodus who also was assassinated). This is all historical fact and that's the end of the movie's factual content everything else is just fiction!

I recently added Gladiator to my 4K collection and watching it in that format was a real treat.After an intense conflict in Germania, Roman general Maximus is summoned by Marcus Aurelius to become emperor after his passing, which infuriates his son commodus. Commodus in turn has Maximus' wife and child murdered and he is then forced into slavery. it is there Maximus ends up in the hands of Proximo, a former gladiator turned slave trader. Through the film, Maximus uses his superior fighting skills to fight his way to revenge in a final showdown with Commodus.The script, character development and choreography of the combat scenes are spectacularly done. the film itself is beautifully shot and flawlessly edited. The roman Colosseum is a true on screen spectacle and the fight scenes are gritty, violent and very intense. On screen performances from Crowe, Phoenix and Nielsen are all fantastic and very believable characters. even the supporting cast from Djimou Honsou (hope i spelt that correctly), and the super adorable Spencer Treat Clarke do a wonderful job at adding to the story.

510,dantown,better than a sharpshord in the neck-or whatever,6,18 September 2006,"Russell Crowe is a pretty fine actor. He has the gift of acting on film: if that is a gift-he has it. He has the capacity to connect with the viewer. This movie is typical Roman schlock/ history =low-brow tastelessness. How do you correctly tell a story about the Roman dirtbags? Crowe portrays the General, Gluteus Maximus, who tries to help the Roman dirtbags protect their dirtbag empire. *** Not that I have anything against Roman dirtbag empires*** At any rate, General Maximus Gluteus (Russell Crowe) gets in a big-ass world of trouble because actor Richard Harris, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, likes Russell/Gluteus the Maximus MORE than he loves Marcus Aurelius's own son: Joaquin Phoenix(Commodus Toiletus). Richard Harris had a big-ass career hit 38 years ago with ""MacArthur Park""-A fine and touching pop song which featured Richard Harris singing this masculine song in a powerful way, but an ultimately painful chorus. It was true grandeur in the pop world of AM radio. It was a sexual and sensual coup d'etat for AM radio which cannot be forgotten.I move on. General Gluteus Maximus runs away from Joaquin Phoenix(son of emperor Aurelius), and meets cool people who are slaves 'n' stuff. This is the second-reel...where a hero suffers and becomes a better person and stuff. Russell Crowe-General Maximus- meets tall African beautiful people who are slaves but act noble. Then, breathlessly, the screenwriter draws us back to Rome, where the evil Roman dirtbags live. The People in the gladiator arena in Rome like the gladiator, Crowe/Maximus , because that is what People do, when they have to think about something. Russell Crowe does big things, being noble. I bet the black Africans taught him something about being noble- because they have fine black skin, or something. In truth, tall and fine Africans are fine and beautiful people. This movie exploits them because this is a stupid Hollywood movie. Maximus puts up with repeated nonsense. He finds a way to win. hooray. I think this movie won the Oscar for best gay hairstyle on a leading Australian heterosexual man: Russell Crowe. what an honor. I believe Russell Crowe deserves better than this silly-ass Roman epic. just my opinion. Russell Crowe is just better than this silly trash-but then-really-so am I. Sometimes movies are just commerce. I don't mean to shock y'all. This a beautiful movie-full of great war scenes, and honor and courage. It is also a sleazy Roman history. Roman history is a sleazy Machiavellian thing. Sorry.",Gladiator

Scott did a good job directing this movie.This movie is just plain epic and sad. I loved the emotions going on throughout the movie. Maximus was a slave and he became a very very skilled gladiator. Do you notice a big change going on throughout the movie? i recommend this movie to everyone. I think this movie is better then all the movies i reviewed in IMDb. This movie is terrific art. It seemed timeless throughout the movie. 10/10. If it went up to 20, i'll give it a 19/20 Have Fun With This Movie :)",Gladiator
512,hmsgroop,"Well done, Russell Crowe!",9,16 April 2001,"The film seems to be symptomatic: an empire turns out a film about an empire. So what do the audiences get? On the one hand, the scriptwriter will obviously not set the Thames on fire. The plot is very predictable, the action (especially in the first part of the film) dragged out, dialogue anaemic. There is a ""politically correct"" Juba and the optimistic end. Good guys go home, the evil emperor is punished, Commodus's sister makes another stilted speech. The drawbacks are numerous: first, I doubt that Marcus Aurelius looked so old (he died when he was 59), second, the child Lucius looks like a typical American kid with strange outfit on, Commodus was killed after he had reigned in Rome for 12 years. So what keeps this film from being a tedious pseudo-Roman stuff? First of all, Russell Crowe. He managed to convey that sense of inborn dignity which can't be taken from a real Man. He did a very good job of his character bordering on magic (taking the poor stuff he had to work with into consideration). Second, it's the sound-track. And third, it's the work of the cameramen. The magnificent landscapes, the huge moon, the glimpses of the other world, the silver cypresses moving in the wind. I believe the film is hardly a new word in cinema, BUT it's a story of a Man, a human being at last, not a story of mundane violence. I think people are getting pretty tired of drugs and addicts, cops and mobsters, tearful soap operas. It's a ""fairy tale"" of course, too, but not a bad one. I'd like to mention that an imdb-user Aleona said it was implausible that a Roman emperor had fought a gladiator. An encyclopedia says about Commodus that he took part in gladiator fights.",Gladiator

It was such a faithful retelling of standard, cliche gladiator movies that I could mouth most lines before they were uttered.  It's probably the most faithful remake in history except for Psycho.    Which is not to say it doesn't manage some entertainment value.  Russell Crowe is well cast, Joaquin Phoenix surprised me with his range (by showing he had some), and Connie Nelson gave a subtle performance when I would have expected something more heavy-handed.  But the action sequences are choppily edited and filmed through a haze, making it hard to tell whose blood it is spraying across the screen (I could only assume it wasn't Crowe's character's).

522,Galagonya,A stunning duel staged against the decaying Roman Empire.,9,9 May 2007,"One comment insists that Gladiator would be something for Fight Club fans. I do not get the idea, but I have to admit that I indeed enjoyed both films very much.That much said, be prepared for beautifully shot scenes, spectacular fights, some interesting characters (there could have been a little enhancement in this respect, but nevertheless, the characters are strong and sound).Kudos to Joaquin Phoenix in the first place. He performs a haunted, tormented and cruel emperor you can still sometimes glimpse the human and pitiable side of, and is altogether very creepy and goes under your skin. Yes, he definitely should have gotten the Oscar. He is the only member of the cast I can not imagine to be replaceable. His interpretation of Commodus adds depth to Gladiator as otherwise it might have been just the usual the very, very, very good guy battles the bad, stupid, really bad one against all odds. Russell Crowe is a fine Maximus. He engages in some spectacular fights in and out of the arena while showing off genuine feelings and wits. The opening battle is in its genre perfect in my belief. The much disputed scenes where he is floating over the fields are a bit kitschy, a bit cheesy, but still, nice thought, and do not work that bad with the excellent music. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are both rendering great performances and contribute mainly to the authenticity (not meant in a historical sense) of the story. Why is it a problem for so many that in the end Maximus fights and kills the Emperor in the arena in a duel that never ever took or would have taken place in reality? Do not expect historical correctness or accuracy, this is not a documentary to be broadcast on National Geographic or the History Channel. Enjoy Gladiator for for what it is, an action-drama-epic imaginary saga set in powerful cruel ancient Rome already overshadowed by its unavoidable fall from greatness.",Gladiator
523,judemcrobbie,One of the best action flicks ever.,9,17 February 2021,"Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix are terrific in this movie. Russell Crowe provides the charisma and acting necessary to the role. His one line helps compound the iconography of the movie, who doesn't know ""Are you not entertained?"". Joaquin Phoenix role in this is played so perfectly. The little details in his are just incredible, the indescribable bottom lip thing he does to show he's sad is brilliant. He also shows this almost MacBeth-like character in the movie as he shows this king going crazy with power.
The cinematography in this is gorgeous and makes every punch, every stab and every kick. Also the cinematography, costume design and art direction are some of the best and subsequently iconic of all time. The mask, the static camera shot of his head and the aforementioned ""are you not entertained"". Just brilliant story telling conveyed throughout.
The first two acts are really strong, bu thee final act seems slightly disconnected. I do love how it subverted our expectations and instead of having a large fight at the end, giving the final act a sense of personality to the fight in the end of the movie. Finally the final scene is truly moving and could almost bring you to tears.",Gladiator
524,Hairy_Lime,Well made and entertaining,7,27 August 2006,"There is a place for a well made, entertaining film like this; as far as I am concerned just not, generally, on the Oscar podium, but still.Gladiator has some impressively filmed scenes; the extended battle scene at the beginning is first rate, as is the recreation of the battle of Carthage in the Colessium (Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't we win? - great line). All of the fighting scenes were imaginatively staged.The acting was decent. Russell Crowe - not one of my favorite actors - proves he can be effective when he's not given too much to say, and Juaquin Pheonix is superbly creepy throughout.But I found myself annoyed at stretches of the film, particularly at the end, where Crowe envisions meeting his wife and child on a tree line alley through a field of wheat, or something. It's what I expect from a Mitch Albom book, not a serious movie. Not that it detracts too much from the film, really. The story of Crowe's family is the peg to hang the action on; it adds neither intellectual or emotional depth to what is in reality a well-made, well-shot, entertaining popcorn muncher.",Gladiator
525,npvarley,The best. Simple as that.,10,11 December 2015,"I will start off by declaring that, IMO, this is the best film I've ever seen. Why? Well, the reasons are many. First up, the acting is superb. All the major players put in excellent turns, as do the bit-part actors. Russell Crowe will never inhabit another character the way he does Maximus. He looks like he was born to play this part. He presents us a man with immense charisma, authority, bravery, honour and dignity. A man prepared to die for what is right. Joaquin Phoenix gives us an emperor, Commodus, that is entirely credible: one minute, he's reasonable and lucid, the next, he is psychotic. Oliver Reed, in his final role, is an excellent lanista (director of a gladiator school). Connie Nielsen, as Commodus' sister and would-be lover of Maximus, has to run the gauntlet of Commodus' psychotic behaviour to preserve her's and her son's lives. All in all, top notch acting all-round. They're given a great story and script to work with, too.The cinematography is magnificent. The colours the dust, great camera angles, judicious cutting around scenes. It works to create intense images that place the actors firmly in the forefront. The digital recreation of roses is amazing and you have to look very hard to detect the digital effects. Ridley Scott has produced one of his greatest directing achievements.Finally, the music, from Hans Zimmer, is magnificent. It supports the action and moods of the scenes expertly, without ever intruding too much, which is the mark, IMO, of a great score and soundtrack.If you have not seen this movie, or bought the Blu-Ray, I have only one question: why not? This is a MUST WATCH movie. Simple as that.",Gladiator

Marcus' neglected and power-hungry son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), has other ideas, however. Escaping an ordered execution, Maximus hurries back to his home in Spain, too late to save his wife and son from the same order. Taken into slavery and trained as a gladiator by Proximo (Oliver Reed), Maximus lives only that he might someday take his revenge and fulfill the dying wish of his emperor. The time soon comes when Proximo's troupe is called to Rome to participate in a marathon of gladiator games held at the behest of the new emperor, Commodus. Once in Rome, Maximus wastes no time in making his presence known, and is soon involved in a plot to overthrow the emperor with his former-love Lucilla (Connie Nielsen, Commodus' sister, after whom he lusts, and also the widowed mother of Lucius, heir to the empire after his uncle, and democratic-minded senator, Gracchus (Derek Jacobi).Without a doubt, one of the best films I've seen.Gladiator gets 10 stars.",Gladiator

Even if doesn't absolutely respect history, this movie is a beautiful work and a great wonder for our eyes. Scott directs the battle with great ability, helped by the editing of the great Italian Pietro Scalia (Academy Award winner for ""JFK""): the initial battle in the woods is frenetic and impressive with the force of a thunder and the fights in the arenas are exceptional, a demonstration of what the evolution in movies can do. And also the cast, which sometimes is sacrificed for the show, shows a very great power: Russell Crowe is a suffering but determined Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix an evil, weak and complex Commodus, Connie Nielsen is so beautiful than good actress and then there is a great english trio formed by Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed (dead during the shots). Giorgio Cantarini (Benigni's son in ""La Vita è Bella"") plays the brief role of Maximus' son.

533,Jim Griffin,Yet another over-rated classic,4,22 December 2000,"Whenever a new Ridley Scott movie appears, I can hardly contain my indifference.  He's way too variable in terms of quality for me to get excited about a new release: Alien is a great movie, Thelma and Louise is nothing special, White Squall is pants, and G.I. Jane was surprisingly good, but I'm the only person who seems to think so.  With this track record, as I walked into Gladiator I was less expectant than Adam Sandler on Oscar night. It turned out to be worse than I thought.Gladiator is an epic-by-numbers.  Sweeping shots over cities, a couple of thousand extras wearing togas, a few seconds in a battle scene where the music turns to silence and the direct-o-matic uses a different shutter speed...  Seen it all before.  While everyone else was dropping their jaws, my thumbs got busy with the twiddling.If you're going to make a movie where the audience can root for the underdog, you should at least blur the lines a little.  Gladiator's heroic goodies and hissable baddies are so obvious even Spielberg would have complained.  For the Autobots, we have Russell Crowe.  He gets fired from his job, sentenced to death, manages to escape only to find his wife raped and his children murdered, is sold into slavery, forced to perform in front of bloodthirsty crowds as a gladiator, loses his car keys and steps on a dog poo.  For the Decepticons, we have Joaquim Phoenix, who killed his own dad, ordered the deaths of Crowe and his family, forces people to fight and die for his entertainment, wants to do his sister, and kicks puppies in the teeth.  It's as balanced as a see-saw with Jabba the Hutt on one end and Calista Flockhart on the other.It has pretensions above the action movie it knows it really is, and it's at those points that the film moves from boring to laughable.  We're told, over and over again, that gladiator fights are brutal, that  the crowds are disgusting for watching, and that the men are unwilling to take part.  It was at this point I phoned Amnesty International to see what we could do to stop this barbaric sport.  Are we really learning anything by this?  It's in these moments, too, that the film's hypocrisy becomes obvious.  While the viewers are weeping at the injustice of it all, they're also excited by Crowe's muscular heroics, and the slo-mo, pop-promo style used for the bloody fight scenes.  We can condemn the audience in the colosseum for enjoying it, while happily stuffing popcorn down our faces and cheering when Crowe stabs another gladiator.  Is he the only one fighting against his will, or are the people he kills innocent victims too?  Who cares?  We've moved past the pathos now, we're on to the fight scenes.  Carry on Cleo had more emotional impact.The ending is as predictable as possible.  Did anyone really think it would end with Phoenix still in power?  The only good thing about the ending was that it actually had one.  Three weeks into the movie I was starting to have my doubts.  Overlong, over-rated, add it to the list of undeserving modern classics.",Gladiator

536,b-a-h TNT-6,Too flawed to be considered a great film,6,26 January 2001,"WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS AHEADThis is a pretty good film, but certainly not worth being considered a serious candidate for ""best picture of the year"" (sadly, the people at the Oscars are probably gonna think different). The reason for my statement is simple: although the visuals are excellent and there are some really strong points through the whole movie, the script is pretty simplistic, and is inaccurate as a portrait of the ancient Roman empire.Also, I have a big problem with Ridley Scott's depiction of ""evil"" and ""good"" characters. Apart from Blade Runner, he always insists too much on how the bad guy is evil, and how the good guy is the voice of reason and freedom. This movie is no exception. Maximus is portrayed too much as the ""good guy"", yet it's pretty obvious that we can't consider him ONLY good. He was a warrior, fought and killed people for Rome. We see him killing people in the arena as a gladiator, yet anyone can realize their lives as men were as important as Maximus', and the Roman empire did wrong to them as it did to Maximus. Don't get me wrong, Maximus was fighting for revenge and for his own life, and we obviously can't consider him a villain. But anger and sadness should be what we see in Maximus, or maybe his character should be partially rehabilitated -- i.e. regretting his life as a legionary and showing frustration for what he has to do to survive in the arena -- before we are TOLD that he is SO good and caring. Sadly, the script doesn't add much depth, and that's a shame because I think Crowe could have done much better with a good script. More, Ridley Scott tricks us by making Maximus a man that once was just a farmer, and that's historically inaccurate (in the Roman empire you couldn't become a Legion commander unless you were a noble). I found the movie too manipulative to make me really care about Maximus' character.More, I found the love story with the princess pathetic. It didn't add anything to the movie, and it was there just to make it a little more appealing to the mass audience. A love story between two ""beautiful people"" always works for some. Not for me. I recently saw the DVD version and I think most of the stuff that got cut out was actually much more interesting than this love story.Elsewhere, the movie is really good. The visuals are great, and I liked Commodus' performance as well (although I wouldn't call it outstanding). The battle scenes are very impressive. The fight in the end is awesome, too.I would rate this movie something between 6 and 7 out of ten, but I stick with 6.

First of all, this movie is an adrenaline pump for impressionable viewers.  Maximus's world is full of danger through the whole film and the viewer shares those fears and thrills, the battles, the gladiator bouts, the secret conspirings.  Secondly, this movie fills your heart with sadness and you are drained and upset when you walk out of there.DON'T try tell anyone that this movie lacks emotion....give me a break!  Not since ""Braveheart"" have I had such a love of a main character.  This dude is a hero in the true sense of the word, totally fearless and driven to achieve his goals no matter what.  Russell Crowe plays him with a modest, almost shy demeanor that is very engaging, considering the character's physical attributes and skills.The photography is spectacular.  The long sweeps of scenery (again reminiscent of the scenes of Scotland in ""Braveheart"") are breathtaking and the depiction of life during those times and especially what Rome was like was one of the best aspects of the movie.I gave this a 9 out of 10, only because some of the dialogue was a little lame and the acting was OK across the board, but not brilliant.

When I heard about the movie I didn't want to see it at the movies but thought I would maybe rent it when it came out on video. But my friend asked me to join him so I did.The first 30 minutes are really bad and I wanted to leave the theater. I am just not the kind of person who pays full price for a movie that is one big slaughter. I think it was very violent and where is the thrill when two people fight each other and many persons die? The movie did however get better when Russell Crowe got to Rome. Not good, but better. At least I was willing to sit through this to the end. The whole time I had 1 question: why all that praise? The critics love it and many viewers too. I can't see why. But I am not into those historical epics anyway. The actors were okay. Russell Crowe can be a good actor but this part was just boring. Joaquin Phoenix was so wonderful in Return To Paradise with Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn. That movie should actually get all that praise, it's very good. He still gave a good performance in Gladiator.

Even the often appalling Oliver Reed does good work in his last film. Ridley Scott directs this film with a deft touch, heavy where he needs to be, violent and brutal, but not gratuitous, and with a good eye for the spectacular.The plot stretches credibility in the latter half and I for one feel that Maximus' identity was exposed to the evil Commodus just a bit too early on. Commodus - what a villain, played with just a touch of camp by Joaquin Phoenix. Swarthy, oily, murderous, cowardly, lusting disgustingly after his own sister, what other name could one give such a character than a Latinised word for ""toilet"".

THe story would have been a success even if Gladiator was lacking in the human element, but the fact is that the unholy tragedy that befalls Crowe and his subsequent quest for revenge drive the rest of the film, and make all of the various actions scenes those of 'higher stakes' than normally expected (ie. the only risk is your own skin, here it is a whole set of moral beliefs and a legacy of love).Such a perfect fusion of drama, acting, action and musical score, this film is Hollywood at it's very best, with a British twist - humilty.

The worst part is the hackneyed Hollywood sappy ending that leaves you feeling intellectually cheated. After Gladiator, I finally decided never to see another Hollywood blockbuster in the theater - why did it take me so long to learn that lesson? On an historical note, Commodus really did enjoy participating in the games, much to the embarrassment of the Roman upper class.

In the aftermath, Caesar dies of ""mysterious"" causes and his son, Joaquin Phoenix, takes the crown.  He orders Crowe to be executed, but Crowe escapes, only to be trained by Oliver Reed as an arena gladiator.  Crowe becomes a favorite of the bloodthirsty crowds by the time that Phoenix learns of his escape. Soon, Phoenix and Crowe will have to come across one another's path. The film has great flavor for the period and solid acting and good computer enhanced effects, but the battle scenes are too often done in a stylized, close-up manner, which makes it difficult to discern exactly what is happening.

Demille film (e.g. ""Ten Commandments"") in that it's great entertainment with a huge budget & sets.  Or for a more modern analogy, it's more along the lines of the grandiose pomposity of the ""Titanic"" movie or ""The Patriot.""

He is a born leader and warrior who has only one dream: to defeat all who oppose his Emperor and to retire back to his Spanish farm with his wife and son. When those things are taken from him by the ruthless Commodus his initial welcoming of death becomes tempered as he sees a way to return vengeance upon those who have destroyed him. Ridley Scott deserves most of the congratulations as it is he who once again delivers us the kind of movie he is capable of making, beautiful, graphic but above all else utterly absorbing. The special effects and the music are amazing and serve to draw you completely into the film as its story unfolds and not once do you find yourself thinking 'Nah, that didn't look real'.

555,artemis_5,Beautiful Tale of Revenge and Power,9,26 January 2006,"""Gladiator"" is about revenge and the struggle between two men for Rome, one an emperor, the other a gladiator slave. The movie begins as Emperor Marcus Aurelius ends his twelve year campaign against the ""barbarians"" to secure the borders of the Roman empire. Following a victory against a Germanic tribe, Aurelius tells his favorite general (who is like a son to him) that he wants him to be his successor and to be the ""protector"" of Rome until the Senate is ready to rule. He wants Rome to be republic once more, but has reservations about whether his son Commodos is willing to give up power. The favored general, Maximus, turns down the emperor's offer because he does not feel that he has the political background to rule Rome, and because he wants nothing more than to go home to his wife and child.In less than a night, Maximus' hand is forced when Commodos assassinates Aurelius and declares himself his heir. When Maximus realizes what has happened, he refuses to give Commodos his loyalty. Commodos orders him and his family executed. Maximus escapes, but his family is burned and crucified (an execution method of which the Romans were particularly fond). Maximus is enslaved and turned into a gladiator when a passing caravan finds him at his burned out home unconscious. Gladiator fights have become very popular since Commodos overturned his father's ban on them, and the man who runs the gladiator school where Maximus is being trained, Proximo, if looking to profit from his new acquisition. Although he initially refuses to fight, Maximus soon gains fame throughout the empire, and respect from his fellow fighters, as ""the Spaniard,"" and eventually finds himself fighting in the Coloseum in Rome.The Rome that greets Maximus is completely under the spell of Commodos, who has won the people over with spectacular gladiator matches. When Maximus become a crowd favorite, Commodos takes an interest in him (not having recognized him). As the two men meet in the middle of the arena, and ""the Spaniard""'s real identify is revealed, a power shift occurs, and Commodos realizes that he can no longer kill Maximus and still keep the Roman public on his side. Maximus realizes this as well, and what follows is a beautifully orchestrated contest of powers between the two men, which culminates in a final showdown in the Coloseum, and an emotionally charged ending.Also to be commended is Hans Zimmer for his beautiful score.",Gladiator

557,Caledonia Twin #1,A triumphant achievement from all angles,10,30 January 2001,"So what if Commodus was actually murdered in his bathtub?  And honestly, do we care that he actually ruled with his father Marcus Aurelius as co-emperor for several years before Marcus Aurelius died?  At least, these are some of the facts which have been rearranged in ""Gladiator"", but why not take liberties with poetic license?!  Great cinema is about drama, and this is not a documentary, nor will the audience be disappointed by what they see. Gladiator gives the audience what it wants: the human connection.  History is not flat, lying on a page.  It was real, as real as today is now, and in Gladiator, history is alive, visually compelling... transporting.  What higher compliment could we give than that so many people have been able to instantly identify with a time and place that most of those watching this film have never given much thought to before?  How can this in itself not be called a triumph?  And I would even argue that the writers of these historical epics *must* truncate and rearrange so many aspects of one historical era to reproduce the whole for our understanding... thus aspects of the equally despotic Roman emperors Caligula and Nero are merged with the character of Commodus... but Gladiator is not merely a visual success, or that merely because of its fantastic special effects.  It is quite simply a compelling story.   We all support Maximus in his fight to avenge the murders of his wife and son.  We all love to watch the strangely intriguing performance of the ambitious, luminously mad emperor Commodus... and the delicate maneuvering of his politically-minded sister, Lucilla!  The acting in Gladiator is also reason enough to see the film.  Not only have we the last performance of the great Shakespearean actor Oliver Reed playing Promximo, and the incomparable Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, but two new luminaries on the cinematic horizon: Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.  If great acting can be accomplished with the simple movement of the eyes, if great acting, as has often been said, can be achieved with and within the subtlety of a single expression, then these two have mastered the art of great acting!  A telling point would be to see the film dubbed into Italian (close to Roman Latin); this would prove, I think, how talented these actors are in the expressiveness of their emotions through the eyes and body language, as well as through their fantastic speaking voices.  As for Connie Nielsen, I have to say that she was excellently cast as the elegant Lucilla; had Ridley Scott substituted her for any other more well-known but less capable Hollywood actress, I think the role would have been the film's greatest weakness.  In fact, it was a wise choice to cast this film with extremely talented but less well-known actors (though NOT ANY MORE!), or else Gladiator may not have seemed so realistic, nor made so powerful an impact on so many.  I would recommend this film to anyone.  My rating: 11/10.",Gladiator
558,Caledonia Twin #1,fiction better than reality; the mindset of Rome,10,1 February 2001,"*Warning: spoilers.  Recently, a kind person out there notified me of an historical mistake in my previous commentary, pointing out to me that it was Lucius Verus who co-ruled with Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris' character in the film) and not Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).  I have to thank that person, because to be honest, I have not read much about the later years of the Roman Empire in many years, and had forgotten many details concerning the end of the Pax Romana.  Nonetheless, and I may be wrong about this as it comes off the top of my head, I do believe that Marcus Aurelius did in fact approve of the choice of his son Commodus, which was not the case in ""Gladiator"".  But I have to say, in this matter, I prefer the fictional account of the events over the reality.  And to me, ""Gladiator"" does capture the essence of a broader Roman history in microcosm.  In particular I found it strikingly interesting that at one of the gladiating tournaments in the film, the commentator spoke of the ancient Roman enemy of mighty Carthage as something out of ""hallowed antiquity""... it seems unbelievable to imagine that the Roman empire lasted nearly a thousand years, and its citizens would probably have never been able to imagine it ending (doesn't it LOOK in the film as though the colosseum was built to last forever?  And they do call Rome ""the Eternal City"", after all) or that a dark age would follow, with a thousand more years of ignorance and illiteracy until our modern age.  It's hard to imagine that by the time in which ""Gladiator"" takes place, the Punic wars against Carthage which they use to stage gladiator battles in ""Gladiator"" had been over for around four hundred years!  It kind of puts it into perspective how short-lived our own modern era is thus far.  And just how long will we prosper before our ""empire"" begins to decline?  When I think of this and put myself in Marcus Aurelius' shoes, who, in ""Gladiator"", could foresee that under his son Commodus, the empire would be heading into disaster (it IS nice to think that Marcus Aurelius would have foreseen this), I can understand why he was so determined to choose Maximus as his successor in order to return Rome to a republic (arguably something better). ""Gladiator"" is on one level a satisfying film because it not only asks what might have been possible to save the Roman Empire from collapsing but tempts us with a possible answer!  As it turned out, nothing could save Rome; though the strength of Maximus' character is such that you begin to believe that he can save Rome from itself.  To sum it up: if you enjoy a thought-provoking film that will leave you with more questions long after the film is over, you'll enjoy ""Gladiator"".",Gladiator

It'll also satisfy many, particularly fans of the sandle-epics of the '50's and '60s.  Be forewarned, however, despite the innately cheesy dialogue and innane plot diversions, ""Gladiator"" is anything but an old-fashioned technicolor epic.  If anything, ""Gladiator"" moves too far the other way, employing an MTV-generation editing style and visual aesthetic that is dizzying and, moreover, overstated.  As well, Scott makes the dreadful mistake of beginning his film with a battle scene that is shot and edited in a fashion identical to the opening scene of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" complete with washed-out colours, varied speeds of motion and muffled sound. If you can look over this, however, you're in for some truly spectacular Gladiator fight scenes in a cinematic mock-up of the Roman Coliseum and 2nd century A.D. Rome.  Here, Scott's style shines, in much the same way it did with Blade Runner almost 2 decades previous.  Rome's ancient architecture is rendered believably real, with the employment of special effect techniques that seemed frivolous and tiresome in last year's ""Star Wars: Episode 1, The Phantom Menace.""  Strangely enough, the future of the historical epic looks bright.  And so does Russell Crowe's career, mind you.

The characters are quite as flat as they are on Star Wars 1 2 and 3. Even cinematography makes you squirm. Zoom in on a actor while he is monologuing?

In particular, I was highly disappointed with the cinematography.  Why, oh why, do all modern directors (other than Ang Lee) think that every action scene must feature a shaking camera and intermittently altered film speed, both of which interfere with the viewer's ability to actually SEE what's going on?  The battle scenes, while impressively staged, were not filmed nearly as well as ""Braveheart"", the swordplay looks quite tame compared to ""Crouching Tiger"", and you can find more impressive Colosseum action in ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben Hur"". The plot and dialogue were hack writing at best and revisionist history at worst, with clearly American sentiments filling in for anything recognizably Roman.          There is actually a lot to like about this movie.  The sets are dazzling, the acting is quite good, and the drama is often quite real... although it isn't sustained throughout.  Russell Crowe gives a strong performance and commands a tremendous screen presence, although he displays less range than in his earlier work.  Joaquin Phoenix manages (barely) to avoid falling into the realm of camp, although he is dealt quite a few inane lines.  In fact, all the main actors deserve tremendous kudos for salvaging what could have been a bomb in less capable hands.  It's worth noting that ""Gladiator"" received Oscars for acting and costumes, not for directing, cinematography, or screenplay.But Best Picture?  Are you kidding me?

I also didn't expect to see any real history presented. Even otherwise great movies take more than a little liberty with historical fact but this one was so far off they might as well have used completely fictional characters. The real disappointment is with the much praised visuals. When Maximus and the other gladiators enter the coliseum it is announced that they are going to present a re-enactment of the siege of Carthage.

569,lucifer,Better than Ben Hur? Indeed it is.,9,24 May 2000,"This is the first Roman epic for many years, so many were ready to rip into it, with comparisons to Ben Hur and Spartacus awaiting.First things first, this easily holds up to the aforementioned epics, whilst surpassing them in several areas (the realism for one). Secondly, it puts Russell Crowe into the running for the ""real man"" roles that Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson are getting too old for.The whole cast come off looking well, especially given the fact that there were only 35 pages of useable script. Add to that the fact that from those pages, Ollie Reed and Richard Harris would still refuse to use some of the dialogue because they didn't like it. Much of the script was done in situ. A Roman epic as done by John Cassavetes?The only sticking point (performance-wise) was the occasionally hamminess of Joaquin Phoenix's Emperor Commodus (given that his name is also used to refer to a toilet, he's forgiven). He more than makes up for this by being very effective the rest of the time (thus he only rates a 0.2 on the Ustinov scale of hammy scenery chewing).The action scenes are stunning, easily outdoing Ben Hur's justly famed chariot race. Crowe comes off best here, though only just - his whole performance carries the film. With a presence you can't fail to be pulled in by, Crowe scythes through armies and gladiators alike, becoming a firm crowd favourite along the way.As with Spartacus, the events here are based on real Roman history. The two Marcus Aurelius and Commodus were previously portrayed by Alec Guinness and Christopher Plummer respectively, in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964).One final note. Rest in piece Ollie.

570,dover,A Riveting Movie,8,17 May 2000,"Chances are you know something of this movie, and have heard the excellent reviews for it.  This is largely to the fact that, as a summer epic, ""Gladiator"" is a very watchable  and entertaining movie, delivering all the big-time action some want to see, while still maintaining a level of clean dialogue and plot to spark the interest of the more discerning viewer.Russell Crowe, as the hero Maximus, is very good. He is excellent at playing the outraged but moral good guy stuck in a position he can do nothing about (a la L.A. Confidential), and he is brawny enough to pull off the action hero look.I especially liked Joaquim Phoenix here. The part he plays, the new Caesar Commodus, is partially based on fact (unlike the entirely fictional Maximus). He's the only one here who really manages to convey the sense of decadence and depravity that pervaded the upper classes of Roman society during its decline. In my mind, Phoenix stole every scene he was in.There are a couple problems. For one, director Ridley Scott (who did Alien, amongst others) concentrates more on heads getting chopped off then what could have been a rather engaging plotline, which is reduced to the bare points necessary to drive the action. This movie also falls into the ridiculous assumption Hollywood always seems to make that the upper class of any society has a British accent; it may not be a huge deal, but it's a pet peeve, and it makes no sense. Why would there be any particular accent? The battle scenes, while exceedingly bloody, are also a bit contrived, and don't seem real at all. Scott also makes some incredibly obvious attempts at symbolism using background colors that no one will miss, and it loses some significance because it's just so obvious.All in all, this was a very good movie. It was fun to watch, and I was entertained for 2 1/2 hours. The combination of action, good acting, and semi-intriguing plot makes this a shining example of the blockbuster epic, sure to entertain just about anyone.",Gladiator
571,Eelco_1977,Excellent!,9,29 May 2000,"I almost loved everything about this movie, accept Joaquim Phoenix (alias Commodus). I really hated it in the first hour of the film when he came in the picture, his acting was really horrible. But, the last 40 minutes he did a better job. The fightscenes were the best I've ever seen and I never did feel bored during the movie. I was pleased that in the movie the fightscenes didn't play a leading role. The story was excellent but a bit cliché at the end. It wasn't that hard to find out how it was going to end. The film's score was good, but not the whole time, but that's I think a matter of taste. I hope Russell Crowe will get an Oscar and that this movie will be nominated a lot of times. Great!!!!!!",Gladiator

574,mr composer,Nice Tale of the Roman Empire,9,18 October 2001,"This is yet another successful film starring Russell Crowe, who has turned in some of the most versatile acting performances in the past decade, including ""A Beautiful Mind"", ""The Insider"", and ""L.A. Confidential"". This film is a well-paced, action-packed (if not always realistic) film. What my wife liked about it (of which I'd have to agree) is that it is simple in its plot, very easy to follow, yet is never lacking in the right amount of action or momentum. It is a summer-movie but a well-made summer movie. I'm not sure that I would have voted this for the Best Picture Oscar it received (""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" had more depth and ""Almost Famous"" was very witty), but I certainly can't say it was a bad choice. This is definitely worth a look at least once.",Gladiator
575,Bob A-2,"Riotously campy success in the ""guilty pleasure"" genre, but much too long due to pretense of being some kind of intellectual high tragedy.",5,27 August 2000,"Finally saw Gladiator. Now that's guilty pleasure. Definitely a guy movie, as men outnumbered women three to one in audience. Star Wars, popular as it was, made the mistake of actually being about something; I'm happy to say that Gladiator has no redeeming value whatever. Just blood, mud and crud. Some of the killing made me laugh out loud, like when Crowe stabbed a guy with two swords and then chopped off his head while he was still standing. When Oliver Reed went into that monologue, accompanied by full orchestra, about the thrill of the cheering crowd I almost thought he was going to sing There's No Business Like Show Business. You know something is a bit over the top when one of the most restrained performances comes from Richard Harris! Another big laugh was when Crowe and Djimon win the crowd over by becoming the first ""tag team"" gladiators in pre-television history. Film pictures all the gladiators as united against some unnamed enemy over on the other side of the arena, thus daintily skirting the more Spartacus-like reality that the gladiators fought and killed each other -- and therefore, presumably, were hard put to have indulged themselves in the kind of emotional ties we see here. When the leading lady (Connie Nielsen, in fact just about the only woman) arranges to meet Crowe privately, she explains for the audience's sake that patrician women purchased sexual favors this way all the time. Seems to me everybody onscreen would know that already! It's like in The Mikado where Yum Yum turns halfway toward the audience and says to Nanky Poo ""But darling, you forget: in Japan..."" except that in the latter case WS Gilbert meant it as a joke. The one thing that dampened the pace was long dialogue scenes between the battles, as if the movie were hunting desperately for some intellectual point that would justify its existence, not unlike the '63 Cleopatra in that way. Unnecessary in either case, serving only to protract the running time. Gladiator should be at least a half hour shorter than it is. Audience ate it up, though.A friend commented ""Gladiator will live on TNT and USA forever!"" but I think she underestimates basic cable: there will probably also be a series starring Lorenzo Lamas.",Gladiator
576,Rick NYC-2,two movies for the price of one,8,14 May 2000,"There is the drama, very Shakespearean in nature, with the complexities of power, betrayal, loyalty, love of king, family and country; and then there is the action. The movie has the feel of a committee behind it. The screenplay probably didn't specify too much about the battles, both military and gladiatorial, and somebody along the way probably decided that that the movie was too sophisticated and dramatic to sell without a lot of violence. The battles and fights are not particularly ingenious. I was never grossed out to the degree I had hoped for; I was rarely in suspense, and I didn't find the action to be specific enough. I wasn't always sure what specifically was happening in a fight. The violence didn't measure up to the politics in the drama. That said, the drama was fine, and Joaquin Phoenix held his own as the evil Commodus, and Mr. Crowe will get another crack at an Oscar. The story, by the way, is a flight-of-fancy, taking off from the more boring history, which is that Marcus Aurelius chose Maximus over his own son, Commodus, to rule Rome, but Commodus had Maximus (and his brother Condianus) assassinated after an early attempt was made on his life, orchestrated by his jealous sister Lucilla. Lucilla was exiled (later killed) and many suspected enemies (Maximus among them) were also assassinated. That wouldn't have made a very good movie, so we start by having Maximus show disrespect for Commodus on his first day in office, which causes Commodus to have him assassinated, the attempt of which he escapes miraculously. Lucilla remains in the story as a weak, sniveling (possibly incestuous) hanger on, and the historical fact that she was a power hungry conniver herself is conveniently excluded so that she can stay in the story till the end. In real life, Commodus was finally poisoned by a favorite concubine (Marcia) with the assistance of the palace staff, who were all afraid that they might be next in Commodus's paranoid rampage of executions. In addition, Gibbon (Rise and Fall of the Roman Empire) tells us that Commodus was much like Caligula in his taste both for assassinating his potential enemies and for orgies with both boys and women. That sexual side was not in the movie. I sorely longed for Bob Guccione's presence. Finally, only a small reference is made to the fact that Commodus fancied himself a great gladiator, calling himself the Roman Hercules. His servants concocted fixed ""battles"" with (drugged) wild beasts and (drugged or disabled) gladiators that he would always win. The crowd, according to Gibbon, found this display of vanity a bit annoying, but the thing that made the people really mad was that he was simply killing too many people. People will tolerate a lot from an emperor, but not the possibility that they will be his next victim.",Gladiator
577,markguszak,"Pretty good movie, but far from great.",7,28 December 2000,"I perhaps had too high of expectations for this film. I am a big Russell Crowe fan and the hype surrounding this movie was rather positive. However, whenever you see Ridley Scott's name as director, you should have reservations. I feel that Scott is right up there with Jerry Bruckenheimer in the making of MTV video movies. The stories tend to have some style and little substance. In Gladiator you get that style, but sadly, very little substance. Although Crowe was very good, that is no great feat, Crowe is always good. The problem with this movie was the real lack of supporting players. Phoenix was rather one dimensional and Oliver Reed was dead, literally. Perhaps I am being too negative, the movie is certainly entertaining and worth the rental, but it is not Spartacus, not even close. You want to see some kick butt fighting, check it out, but there are few Oscar clips here. Perhaps I should be more complimentary, it was Ridley Scott!",Gladiator

Gladiator is a 2000 historical action/drama film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Crowe portrays the loyal General Maximus Decimus Meridius, who is betrayed when the Emperor's ambitious son Commodus (Phoenix) murders his father and seizes the throne. Reduced to slavery, Maximus rises through the ranks of the gladiatorial arena to avenge the murder of his family and his Emperor. While Gladiator was criticized by historians for its historical inaccuracies, its epic scope and intense battle scenes won praise. The film's success may have helped to revive the historical epic genre, with subsequent films such as Troy, Alexander, and Kingdom of Heaven, the last of which was also directed by Scott.",Gladiator

582,tommyboy-16,good but could of been better,7,30 December 2000,"This is a very good movie. I viewed it at home and I imagine it would be even more majestic on the big screen with a tub of popcorn in hand and my shoes sticking to the floor.Russell Crowe is great as Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is very believable as your typical schizo, paranoid Caesar with a flair for incest. I think he drank too much of the Roman water or maybe it was just a case of when in Rome do as the Romans. Hey, you look kinda cute, sis. Richard Harris's character as the old Caesar is a little too soft for me. I realize he is old, but hey, its good to be king. He was a little too touchy feely, but Harris salvages it and reels you in.The look and feel of the movie is awesome and the story is superb. The story reminded me a lot of Braveheart with a few different twists. Braveheart stuck in a different world. Unlike Mel Gibson in Braveheart, Crowe does not give a quick glimpse of his gluteus maximus. I guess that is not his trademark. By the way, in my mind thats a big plus for the movie.I scored this movie an 8. A disappointing 8. Why? Maybe because I was expecting a 9 or maybe even a 10. Why did it not deliver? I expected more true history, I guess. The gladiator's contests were too choreographed. The violence sometimes fit in the movie like hair in your chewing gum. Can't get it out, but it definitely does not belong there. Many of the fights were very good and others were like Jackie Chan and sword meets the gladiator. The one that comes to mind is when Maximus has 2 swords and stabs them into his foe. Not bad, pretty cool, very Romanesque. Then he draws them out, twirls them around and does a double sword decapitation of the poor soul. He must have worked at Beni Hana as a table chef. I was waiting for him to spit some tobacco, go into a back flip followed by a chinese split and remark, ""I'll be back"". machomus maximus ridiculous! I like the gladiator type fighting in Conan the Barbarian much better. I think when guys fight to the death you may see a little fear, more frantic fighting, and maybe even some biting or spitting and maybe even a little begging. You know, the way you would act if a snake crawled in your bed at night. A fast pace.The tigers were real healthy looking and for some reason I always thought they used lions. The contestants entered the arena very elaborately sometimes and so did the feline carnivores. Maybe thats the way it was; I don't know.Don't get me wrong this is still a very good movie. If you like a little tussle in the coliseum mixed with some emotional stuff then rent it. I may even buy it some day. I say, a big thumbs up, let the movie live.",Gladiator

I don't care what anyone says I think Joaquin Phoenix did the best job as Commodus.

This is definitely Oliver Reed's best performance ever, unfortunately his last.

Yet, as much as I loved Russell Crowe in this movie, I find that Joaquin Phoenix's performance was just a little bit better. Phoenix has such amazing talent and I was really upset when he didn't end up winning the Academy Award for this performance. Also, Connie Nielsen was also very good and made a perfect Roman princess.

Phoenix's (Caesar's heir) didn't compare to Russell Crowe (Maximus).Characters a bit weak.  What's Maximus' feelings?  Is he unwilling to fight anymore?  Why does he fight so hard when he has nothing to live for?  Does he care or not?  How could Caesar not anticipate his son's rage at being passed over?  And if the sister was so cunning how is it she didn't find a way to assainate her brother who paraded around defenseless in front of her every day for 5 years?  Or that she would allow her secret plans to be heard by her son?  How could a former gladiator slave then go on to enslave more gladiators yet have a self-sacrificing loyalty?The cinematics were a cut above most movies but a cut below Scott's. There were too many different filming styles; in the beginning we have the slow motion blurred battle scenes (yuck).  Then CGI-peppered panorama shots (sorry, those CGI falling rose petals, birds and people still don't look quite right).  Then (my favorite, the most Ridley-like) lush dream sequences with wind swept European countryside.

Three hours long when it should have been 90 minutes, the film has little to go for it apart from Russell Crowe's glower and a wash of grainy CGI effects. I will never understand how Joaquin Phoenix, who is a descent actor (Just watch ""To Die For"") managed to get an Oscar nomination for aping Malcom McDowell's performance in ""Caligula.""

Russell Crowe seemed to have phoned in his performance on this one, and is very disappointing considering his range as an actor. His Academy Award for this film was to compensate for his loss for the film, ""The Insider"", in which he was truly excellent. While it was good to see old timer pros like Reed and Harris, they only served to remind the viewer of those days when Hollywood knew how to produce a spectacle through solid direction, set design, and the coordination of extras through the use of second unit directing, i.e., Yakima Canutt.

591,fmbr-1,Too many errors and an actor made out of wood,3,22 October 2008,"There are a couple of reasons I didn't really like Gladiator.First and foremost is Russell Crowe. I'm an Australian and while it seems a little unpatriotic, the guy is pure wood. He is the new Charles Bronson who has one expression and sticks to it.Thus I had a problem when he supposedly 'sells himself to the crowd'. I'm also a wrestling fan and I can only guess that 'selling' must mean something different to the people who made this film. Crowe does no selling here.The other problem I have is some biiiiig holes in the plot. Commodus becomes the new Emperor and sentences Maximus, and his family, to death. Maximus kills the guards and rides as fast as he can for home. So fast he kills both of the horses he rides although he might have been a little faster if the cinematographer didn't decide that he absolutely had to put in some visual effect to boost his career.Anyway, he gets home and Roman legions had already arrived, tortured and raped his family, hanged them and then left. My question, how did they know? Did Commodus, still up in Germanica somewhere pull out his cell phone and make a call?! I mean, Maximus goes as fast as he can but the enemy troops seem to not only know Commodus' orders but that he is the new Emperor.A friend of mine said that there were communication methods that could have been used. Carrier pigeons, signal towers, etc. Fine, but if the film makers want me to buy that, they should show me this.Next, Maximus falls to the ground grieving for his dead family and then boom, next scene, he's a wounded slave. How did this happen? Even more curious is why a slaver bothered with caring for a wounded slave with the Mediterranean so close by to act as a dumping ground.Third, I still can't understand how Maximus manages to become such an acclaimed gladiator. Nothing I saw endured me toward him and while he was a general that doesn't make him an exceptional fighter. I don't know if I'd win a fight against General Schwarzkopf or Collin Powell but I bet Mike Tyson could beat them in a fight.Finally, all the other anachronisms just added up to cause my poor suspension of disbelief to evaporate.",Gladiator
592,The-Plague,After a Roman soldier is betrayed by his emperor's son he is sold into slavery and forced to fight as a gladiator.,7,14 June 2014,"""Gladiator"" comes out of the gate swinging, immediately opening on the battlefield. Caesar Marcus Aurelius stands off to the side of the battle watching General Maximus Meridius (Crowe) lead his troops to yet another victory. After the battle Maximus longs to return to his family, but Marcus Aurelius wishes to have Maximus succeed him as a regent, in a step towards eventually turning Rome back into a republic. Aurelis feels that his son Commodus is too unjust to rule and that Maximus will unselfishly give Rome back to the people. Commodus learns of his father's plan and before anyone else is informed of the Caesar's wishes he is killed by his son. Commodus then takes control of Rome and condemns Maximus and his family to death when Maximus refuses to pledge his loyalty to the new Caesar.This film is the first large scale movie set in ancient Rome since the 1960′s; it basically combines the plots of ""Ben-Hur"" and ""Sparticus"" then adds a dash of ""Braveheart"" for good measure. ""Gladiator"" is the first movie I've reviewed that had me torn between two numbers to the point that I had to incorporate a half option in my stats section. This movie is director Ridley Scott's first since his box office bomb ""G.I. Jane,"" which lost over 40 million dollars. Luckily for Scott this movie was well received by critics in addition to being a commercial success. ""Gladiator"" won five academy awards including best picture, and grossed over 180 million dollars, but I feel it still had flaws. In my review I will focus mainly on the problems that I had with the movie rather than its merit. 'Gladiator' is fourteen years old and it is still considered a notable success, and anything positive I have to say on top of that would simply be redundant.To begin, Ridley Scott hired historians to ensure that this would be the most accurate movie ever made about Rome, but the story is still full of historical inaccuracies. It is true, that sometimes history must be changed when making a movie to keep the audience interested or to keep the story progressing smoothly, but the inaccuracies to which I refer were sever enough to lead to one historian quitting Scott's team and another asking for their name to be removed from the credits. While I am not going to sit here and list every single deviation from historical fact, I do find the need to raise one query. Why does a Spanish born Roman general have an accent from Australia, a country that during the time period would not existed for over a thousand years? If I only had to review the first forty minutes of this movie, up until Maximus becomes a gladiator, I would consider it perfect. At this point the movie noticeably loses pace, and even the incorporation of the gladiator fight scenes do not help. Luckily, 'Glatiator' still has one ace up its sleeve, Commodus does not know that Maimus is the famous Spaniard. Oh wait, never mind, he finds out immediately following the first battle in the Colosseum! When Maximus removes his helmet to reveal his identity to Commodus he also removes the remaining tension. I wanted Maximus to thrust forward with the fury that only a man who has had his wife and child brutally slain could posses, and nothing.The audience is left to trudge through another hour in a half of hollow fight scenes and Commodus' scheming. Another hour in a half of a second rate villain lusting after his own sister, listening to himself talk, and emitting seriously creepy vibes towards his nephew. Another hour in a half of plot and sub plot with its merit being outweighed by the urge to hit the fast forward button on the remote, just for a little bit. As the movie comes to a close the viewer is rewarded with one last mediocre fight scene pitting two completely unmatched opponents against each other, then poof, it ends. We are left wondering what could have been if everything went right, like the star quarterback that blew out his knee right before going pro.",Gladiator

His consistent and admirable work pull you completely into the screen and take you on a really fun, sad, and rewarding adventure.The art direction in this film is superior. The camera, the script, and the direction are all examples of first class work.  Yet, sadly I see that some people chose to rate it as an awful film...why? Nothing about this film is done badly.

594,ufster-2,All the elements of a great tragedy with a side dish of critique of democracy,9,26 November 2015,"It's a story of love, greed, loyalty, revenge, sex, betrayal and camaraderie all packed into a nearly 3hr movie. What more could you want? Acting is top notch, scenery and visuals are fantastic, pacing is spot on. The many elements of the story are hardly original but they come neatly together to make this movie into a masterpiece.Yet I think what captures the audience in this movie is deeper than that. One sits through the movie feeling, knowing that there really is no resolution for our protagonist at the end. Sure he'll get his revenge and overcome the odds, kill the bad guy and die peacefully believing he'll be reunited with his lost loved ones yet something is missing. Apart from the small diatribe about giving power to Roman citizens and restoring democracy, so much of it feels like it's been done in vain. If one wasn't overly invested in the death of the evil emperor, I can't see where that resolution would come. Strangely enough, this is a better movie for it. I compare it to Troy in this aspect.The wholesome/moral/upright part of the story about a good man avenging the gruesome murder of his family while central to the course of events, doesn't lend itself to an epic finale where all wrongs will be righted and where justice would prevail. No wrong in this instance can truly be righted and what we are asked to accept as justice is ambiguous and less than fulfilling to say the least which I think is all for the better. This is not the epic story of the life of Ramesses II, this is Shelley's Ozymandias ridiculing our notions of greatness as The Gladiator lacks one thing he wants, a simple life with his family, to die of old age in his bed during his sleep yet every step of his life he's pushed by external forces to rise to a challenge he would rather avoid.He's not really a good guy in the classical sense either. He's a Roman General which means he's been told to go and kill hundreds if not thousands of people to invade their land, pillage their resources and ironically enslave them as cheap labor or for recreational purposes. This rings true for many of the other characters as well. The revered emperor who neglected and abused his son having the nerve to chastise him for his ""immorality"" and incompetence, whose actions in raising the poor kid turned Commodus into a man whose ambition and thirst for greatness and power can't be satisfied until all is obedient and subservient to his power, his vision, his ambition. The lovely princess Lucille whose own desire for power and survival skills extend to conspiring to kill her brother. The senate, a corrupt bunch of politicians hiding behind the veil of democracy and claim of representing the people lavishly living off the finances of Rome. Last but not least, the people of Rome who have no qualms about being entertained by slaves being forced to murder each other for their entertainment, trusted by the ""wise"" emperor to make decisions for the well being of themselves and other Romans. This is where the critique of democracy kicks in, contrasted with Commodus' ambition for greatness, his drive for actualizing his vision for Rome these masses of Romans are only interested in their illusions of democracy, in their misguided virtues, in their violent sports and in their desire to feel victorious against the ""barbarians"", the end of the movie becomes somewhat anticlimactic with the thought. One could get political and start drawing parallels between this and the Rome of our era, United States, but I believe this review has gone long enough already.",Gladiator

The first quarter after the battle scene seems to drag on as the pace slows down however it recovers as the rest of the movie is excellent.",Gladiator
598,Ebert,What a mess!,1,27 May 2000,"Ridley Scott is an relapsed. Since ""The Duelists"" he insists in put some cheap glamour on historical situations. The result is a complete mess of incorrect historical insights, kitsch images based on manneristic painters of the XIX century like Sir Lawrence Alma-Tedema and Jean-Léon Gérôme. The dialogs are pure soap-opera: the kingdom of obvious bla, bla, bla. Some isolated efforts of Richard Harris and Oliver Reed are responsible for the less camp moments of the movie. For a second time we assist The Fall of the Roman Empire. Now as a farce. As we said in Brazil: Que merda!!!",Gladiator
599,Twillhead,"""Gladiator"" Is A Perfect Ten",10,13 May 2000,"""Gladiator"" is a film that should suit all tastes. It is expertly mounted and an eye-filling event; the blood and gore, delivered in split-second imagery (allowing your head to fill in the rest) should satisfy the most blood-thirsty movie goer; and the story is a superb tale of good vs. evil, power vs. honor, and ""Might for Right"". I was reminded of ""Camelot"" many times during this film, especially by the almost unrecognizable appearance of Richard Harris as the wise and noble Marcus Aurelis. But the sole weight of this overwhelming piece rests on the shoulders of the magnificent Russell Crowe. If one doesn't believe in him, then one doesn't believe in this epic costume drama. Kudos to the rest of the cast as well, and hand over heart for the late Oliver Reed. But back to Crowe--he is an actor to contend with. My one worry is that this film will reinvent him from ""gifted actor"" to the next ""Hollywood Hunk"". I've watched other mercurial, vastly talented actors, like Mel Gilbson and Alec Baldwin, sell out to beefcake roles, and I'm praying Crowe doesn't fall under the same spell. Although his work in ""Gladiator"" is a tour de force performance, he very nearly sprays testosterone from the screen. It's what was exactly demanded from him in this role, and he exceeded expectations in that regard. My hope is that he continues adding to his extraordinary body of work, rather than ""selling out"". Take my word for it, he'll be the next ""Mel Gibson/Alec Baldwin/""People"" Magazine's Sexiest Man on Earth if he isn't careful. Want to take a trip along side a great actor? Watch ""The Sum of Us"", or even ""The Insider"", and then immediately go out to see ""Gladiator"". In all cases you'll witness a great actor doing his job extremely well.",Gladiator

But then it is spoiled by people opening their mouths. Not because they all have really bad teeth, but because someone should have taken the time to come up with a good script for Ridly Scott to do something with.As ever Mr. Scott proves what a gifted director he is with great visual flair, but again he is poorly served with material that is all mouth and no trousers. And as for the performance by Joauqin Phoenix, well to say he was overacting his role as a madman would be to insult the undisputed title holder of overacting madmen, the one, the only Brad Pitt.It's not bad, but how anybody could say that this is a better film than the simply sublime 'Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon' proves how little taste there is in the world and how unfortunately good guys so often don't get what they deserve.",Gladiator
601,FatPhil,Good solid movie,7,3 November 2003,"Not one of the all-time greats, but certainly one of the all-time pretty-darn-goods. Solid acting from almost everyone. Perfectly fitting soundtrack. Well balanced dynamics (action versus silence versus dialogue). Highlights for me were the later interactions between Caesar and his sister - in particular the busy bee tale and later the only time he really raises his voice at her.Visually, it's a little monotone, but there's good use of space by the director - the claustrophobic scenes give you that sense of discomfort and the more open scenes can be quite airy.Violence levels were expected to be high, so there's no point in anyone complaining about that, you have all the warning you need before you've ordered the ticket.",Gladiator
602,PogoNeo,Epically overrated - even the music,3,15 December 2016,"This picture is epically overrated- it is not the number 46 of the 250 best movies, like the IMDb ratings system states at the time of writing of this review. Because it simply never should have been even near such top 250 list. Aside from a clearly visible big budget, only three things are worth of mentioning: shots of hand brushing thorough stalks of wheat (which are iconic), ""Are you not entertained?!"" shout out moment (of intensive emotions) and the point of story when there is a conspiracy created ""to get him out"" (which in turn leads to a few minutes of enjoyable suspense). Other than that, this picture is quite boring and mediocreIt is suppose to be an epic story, but it does not suck you in on any scale. Instead of that it just epically blows, like if it was a giant blown egg shell- decorated on the outside, but empty on the inside. Even the very first battle in the woods has some stupid visual techniques, with addition of some dog disguised as a wolf saving his master- and what a load of kitsch that was. And the kitsch comes back in epic size at the grand finale- the only missing thing at that point is a group of gladiators singing ""Kumbaya"" to the crowd of cheering and crying spectatorsIn this picture even the music is way below expectations. Yes, there are some good moments, but overall in the beginning and at the end the music is rather weak, while in the middle it is somewhat without a taste or noticeable substance. And what is more, the Wikipedia says that Hans Zimmer took some of this music from Gustav Holst and Richard Wagner. But there is more to it- most likely he also borrows from Henryk Gorecki. And on top of that, some tracks sound like a reworked version of music from ""The Rock"" [1996]"", which Hans Zimmer co-composed; and also there is a musical motive in the ""Gladiator"" that he later on simply reused for the ""Pirates Of The Caribbean"" movie series. But what is the most disturbing in regards to the score is the fact, that he got nominated for that work by Academy Awards, while the co-composer Lisa Gerrard did not. So it is just ridiculous that the music which is at best mediocre got nominated, but at the same time it is scandalous, that only the man of the two persons that created it received such nomination. (Of course all those Oscars prizes for music / songs should not be viewed as something like some kind of musical Metre Convention agreements)But what is most important- it does not matter, if you watch this movie in crappy conditions at the time of its release when you are entering your young adulthood, or if you watch it some 15 years later on a good home cinema system when you are an adult. It is still boring and also flat to some extentDo not waste your time on this one. Go watch a ""Spartacus"" (2004) instead- although it is a TV movie and was not intended to play in the same league as Ridley Scott does with his big bucks flicks, that ""Spartacus"" beats the ""Gladiator"" almost to the ground (but also in no way constitutes as one of the 250 greatest movies ever made)",Gladiator
603,john-3109,Epic struggle,10,15 January 2006,"Ridley Scott film Gladiator (2000), reputedly inspired by a painting, is set in ancient Rome at the time of Caesars (approximately 100-50 B.C.). Leaders of a republican empire that spread across the whole of Europe, most of the Middle East and North Africa, we join their premier General Maximus (Russel Crowe) on the battlefield immediately prior to their invasion of Germany.Caesar himself (Richard Harris) is in old age. He is wondering whether this great empire he has conquered has been worth the sacrifices he has had to make to secure it.It is not long before he finds out. His aptly named and disaffected son Commodos (Joaquim Phoenix) is soon hell-bent on winning control of all that his absent father has won. His unwilling sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) and nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark) are drawn into a succession of outrageous betrayals which they feel helpless to avoid.Loyal Maximus, meanwhile, suffers the loss of his family and barely escapes with his life. Tended to by Juba (Diimon Hounsou) and exiled, of necessity, to a remote part of the Empire - he rebuilds his shattered life championed by the unlikely promoter Proximo (Oliver Reed).No longer the leader of a legitimate army, Maximus makes his name as a prize-fighter or Gladiator. Even in the time of ancient Rome, such a fighter could win his freedom from slavery by open competition in the public arena.Returning to Rome as a self-made champion, Maximus is soon recognised by long-serving members of the Senate like Graccus (Derek Jacobi) with whom he conspires to free Rome from the tyrannous hold that Commodos has gained by deceit.A powerful tale, well told and full of the dark uncertainty that attends such great events.",Gladiator
604,MikeSmash,"Crowe wins big as Maximus in ""Gladiator""",8,13 February 2006,"Russell Crowe earns high marks for his performance as Maximus in the heavily Oscar nominated ""Gladiator"". With a superb supporting cast consisting of Joaquin Phoenix, late Oliver Reed, Connie Neilsen, Richard Harris, & Djimon Hounsou, ""Gladiator"" quickly vaulted Crowe to super stardom. The brutal battle scenes, background shots of the countryside in Rome, the costumes & weaponry, & the gladiator fights exceeded all expectations. Ridley Scott's masterpiece of film-making will stand the test of time & should be used in film schools to teach students effective film direction.""Gladiator"" chronicles the story of Maximus(Crowe), General to frail Caesar Marcus Aurelius' Roman Army as well as a husband & father. After a victorious battle far from home, Caesar(Harris) holds private court with Maximus to offer him his position after his passing. Overhearing this, Caesar's jealous & scheming son Commodus(Phoenix) guilts his father then murders him. Commodus plots to get rid of Maximus because of his lust for power & envy of his father's love for Maximus. I could go on but I would be giving away too much.To make a long story short, Maximus survives Commodus' henchmen's attack, is found near death only to be sold into slavery, loses his wife & son to murder by Commodus' minions, & becomes a very celebrated gladiator in the area. Maximus exacts his revenge on Commodus in the end but pays a heavy price. Maximus soon is reunited with the ones he loves most, his lovely wife & son.There are no disappointments to report with ""Gladiator"" other than to say that Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of Commodus was not his best performance of late. He does get back on track later in ""Ladder 49"" which suited him much better. All in all, a very good film with beautiful cinematography & background music as well.

It's, um, another big Hollywood flick. So what's not to like? I guess if you're at all fussy about how you spend 3 hours of your life then you'd best not waste it in the dark with this one. Ridley Scott, who has brought such a wonderful to feel to so many of his other films succeeds only in making this one dark and distant. We never get close enough to the characters to care about them.

607,Robert-132,A very good film to start the summer...,9,6 May 2000,"The first of the summer blockbusters finally arrives, and if it is any indication of what the summer will be like, this will be a great year for movies.Gladiator tracks the career of a Roman general named Maximus (Russell Crowe), who falls from grace after Emperor Marcus Aurelius dies and is succeeded by his son, Commodus.  Maximus finds himself in the arena fighting as a gladiator, trying to gain revenge for the murder of his family.Ridley Scott's direction is simply inspired, and he is able to bring stellar performances out of his actors.  Further, the art direction and computer imaging brings the ancient Roman world to life more vividly than any film before it.Perhaps one truly great trick that Ridley Scott pulls out of his book is to turn the theatre audience into Romans.  I personally found myself excited as the blood spilled onto the floor in the arena, much to my horror (I have always considered myself peaceful and civilized).  One comes out of the theatre with a sense that perhaps one isn't quite as far from the brutality of the past as we all would hope.If I have any complaint, it is that some of the combat scenes move too fast and have too much going on.  The end result is that the viewer doesn't quite know what is happening.  Perhaps the clarity of the battles in Braveheart would have been more helpful here.So, the final score: 4.5/5.  Definitely worth going to see.",Gladiator
608,Aleona,The Academy bows to what Hollywood is ridiculed for,5,11 April 2001,"First of all, Gladiator is NOT an epic!!!! I know there are sites that claim that historically it is true, but let's be honest...no emperor will ever fight a Gladiator. EVER!!! No matter who the Gladiator really is, just imagine Spartacus fighting the emperor. Umm...no!Second of all --- there is no way Gladiator deserved the Oscar for movie of the year...Sure it deserved to get all the technical decorations and computer animation and whatever else they did to make the Coliseum and all the special effects, but BEST MOVIE?? Is the Academy on crack?
Third of all -- there was no strong acting...NONE!! There were some touching scenes and some beautiful scenes of nature and blood for that matter (if you find that thrilling), but not one actor did a wonderful job acting...They were all predictable. Of course the girl loved the hero and the father didn't love the son, etc., etc. A cliche on top of cliche is all this movie is made of and then it gets an Oscar. Well at least next year the Oscars will be better because they couldn't possibly screw up more this year.
And lastly, when I leave a movie theater, I would like to have something to think about because of a movie I just saw. Some sort of a greater, bigger picture. Here we had a point that being dishonest and weak fires back! That's an original! And it certainly take three hours to deliver that point to the audience. I am not even arguing for good movies to be recognized because given what I think is good may not be the standard for everyone else, but let us not recognize something that is unworthy of it. I was also disappointed in Russel Crowe because I did not expect him to go from LA Confidential and The Insider to crap like Gladiator.",Gladiator
609,RAY-130,"RIDLEY SCOTT WORKS FOR ""PIXAR FOR ""SOME"" ADULTS"" (no naked ladies etc.)",6,19 July 2006,"I think this movie can best described as Blood and Guts"" with super duper computer generated graphics. Displaying ancient Rome as a Beautful cesspool with mobs to be appeased but not a hint of nudity or sex to speak of, is unfair to us, the Romans and filmmakers. ALso this flick makes absolutely no effort to reflect any of the actual history of the period and does not come close to showing the Insanity of Commodus.As a fantasy flick its pretty good and I recommend ""Fall of the Roman Empire, The (1964)"" which covers the same ground withs it own version of history but with Sophia Loren as Livius and slightly more skin/Just watched this movie, again, in 2009 and 2006 comments still correct.",Gladiator
610,Theoron,I've seen this movie before...,7,6 August 2002,"It seems as if the folks at DreamWorks could not decide whether they wanted to remake ""Ben Hur,"" ""Spartacus,"" or ""The Fall of the Roman Empire,"" so they decided to remake all three.  They took two awesome scripts and one mediocre screen play, stuck them in a blender, and the resulting concoction has become the better-than-average ""Gladiator.""  It borrows most heavily from the mediocre ""Fall of the Roman Empire"" in terms of characters and basic plot, but quite a bit of influence from ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" can easily be noted.This is the story of Mad Maximus (Russell Crowe), an Australian who moves to Spain, looks good in a toga and so becomes general of the Roman army. Unfortunately, he refuses to kiss the behind of emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), because he's a bit upset that Commodus killed his own father and Max's best friend Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris).  One bad thing leads to another, and old Mad Max finds himself mixed up with an international cast of characters fighting as gladiators in the Peoria of North Africa.  Soon the day of their big break comes, and it's out of Peoria and on to the Hollywood and Broadway of the ancient world: Rome; to play games of life in death before tremendous crowds at the biggest theater in the world: the Coliseum.Many find the gladiatorial contests of ancient Rome to be rather savage and brutal; but you have to give the Romans a break, in that Hollywood, video games and ice hockey had not yet been invented.  What else is there to do for entertainment other than watch a bunch of strangers poke and stab each other with sharp objects?  Sure, Playstation II has better blood & gore graphics, but several centuries of technological advancement will do that for you.  In the old days, the blood and gore of the arena was all that was available.But an interesting twist develops in the plot: Commodus' sister Lucilla (Connie Nielsen) finally realizes after thirty years that her brother is a sick, unrepentant pervert and lunatic.  Some are slow learners.  So she decides that the ol' gladiator/general Mad Max might be just the guy to help her submarine her bro, and restore peace, justice and the American Way to Rome.Anyone who has seen ""Ben Hur,"" ""Spartacus"" and ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" has already seen this movie.  There's no surprises or suspense, just lots more scenes of people being decapitated and/or disemboweled.  It's amazing what special effects artists and CGI have been able to do to help bring brutality into a far more realistic light than in the past --chalk up another great moment for Hollywood.In the hands of most directors, a film like this would be the scorn and bird droppings of most film critics.  But DreamWorks had an ace up their sleeve: they got Ridley Scott to direct this train wreck of a script, and then work his incredible magic to make the ugly duckling transform into a beautiful swan.  Well Ridley is good, but he's not God, so what we end up with is a swan who's kinda cute, but not quite up to the cover of Sport Illustrated's swimsuit issue.   Still, this is far more than most could have done with such muck.Ridley Scott is one of the few directors who the word ""genius"" sticks to like glue.  You've seen what this guy can do, and do better than most anyone else.  For the movie ""Gladiator"", Scot goes all out.  He gets the BEST actors, the best set and costume designers, and the best composer, then puts it all together and creates a tremendous feast for the eyes & ears.  There are many great performances all throughout this picture, and the camera work and art direction are absolutely top notch.If there is a complaint, it is with the fight sequences.  They are the typical fast cut/shakey camera mish mash that's been going on for ages. One minute a group of guys are facing one another, the next minute a whole bunch of them are dead.  How did it happen?  Who knows, who cares.  Instead of carefully staged shots and fluid camera work, we get the cinema equivalent of projectile vomit.  Oh well, at least I can always put on ""Crouching Tiger"" or ""Phantom Menace"" if I want to see sword play done properly, or the Tyrone Power version of ""Zorro"" (1940).  But I will admit that the battle scene between the Germans and the Romans at the very beginning of the film was extremely well done.  The fast cuts and bouncy camera did an excellent job conveying the excitement and confusion that is prevalent in large scale combat.The actors and the performances they give are far too good for a film of such tripe.  Of particular note is the performance of Lucilla by Connie Nielsen.  The film is worth the price of admission (or the price of the DVD) just to see this woman's face light up the screen and give the over used theme of blood vengeance such dignity, poise and grace.  Lucilla is by far the most interesting character of the film, for she is the only one who goes through a process of transformation by means reflection and examination, rather than by forced external entanglements.  The characters of Commodus and Maximus could have been easily played by cardboard cut-outs with the words ""Bad Guy"" and ""Good Guy"" stenciled on each.  What you see of Commodus and Maximus in the first ten seconds of film is what you see in their final scenes, there is no change or awakening in these two guys.  But Lucilla rewards us with an interesting sort of redemption that makes a rather predictable film worth watching.  As Ridley Scott himself said of Ms. Nielsen: ""She can rule my empire anytime.""My generous rating: 7/10",Gladiator
611,imdb1,"Excellent movie, unfortunate that the General misses human emotions.",8,26 May 2000,"This movie left me with the expression of just one man: The Gladiator.  The rest I forgot as soon as the credit titles began.  I was impressed and that says a lot for someone who sees about three movies every two weeks in the past years.  When I think about what impresses me about this character, who is actually just an ordinary hero, almost invincible, who can slaughter six man in a few seconds without blinking his eyes... what made this character so different, then I come to the conclusion: his modesty. Never before I have seen a Man this Great and yet so modest. And because THAT is what makes this movie so special, what leaves you with feelings of admiration for this Great General (`It's just a movie!', you keep telling yourself), the choice of Russell Crowe as actor seems excellent.  However, this movie could have been so much better, if only Crowe would have shown more humanity. What I miss is (emotional) pain: what this man did go through in his live should have left marks in his face, in his eyes that saw more then an ordinary man can bare. Unfortunately, in this respect his character is rather flat, emotion-less almost. That makes him not-so-human, and therefore touches the spectator less deep in his heart.

This is an epic with no heart and soul - lots of oh-so-evil bad guys and goody-two-shoes, sweetness & light nice guys. You don't feel much for anyone in it, unlike other modern 'epics' like Braveheart, and computerized SFX or not, it can't hold a candle to the likes of Ben Hur/Spartacus etc. In fact, even the effects are not really all that impressive - and if the acting and script had been better I probably wouldn't have noticed, but I had so much time on my hands that I started trying to guess where the 'real' actors and sets stopped and the 'virtual' ones started. It's not quite like Titanic - the effects are not so impressive, and the acting is nowhere near as awful - but it does unfortunately come to mind. Still, at least go & see it in a decent theatre, it will shrivel away to nothing on the small screen.",Gladiator
614,Mr. Superbad,amazing,8,22 May 2000,"Let me say that I saw this in an old theater with natural reverb, that was freezing the whole time. I've noticed Ridley Scott movies have a slightly muddy soundtrack. It's hard to describe, but it's noticeably when you view them. The natural reverb of the theater made it difficult to understand some of the movie, but I still found myself enjoying this movie.
Fuzzy, muddy, indistinct? I don't think so. Practically every scene in this film is beautifully shot, and looks like it could be turned into a painting. From the contrast of fire against the dark woods in the beginning, to the fights in the Coliseum , this film looks amazing. The cgi people weren't going for stark realism, but a very stylized look and I believe it works. If you look at the Coliseum the first row of people is real, and the second is cgi, and for the life of me I couldn't tell the difference. Since everyone seems intent on comparing this to Braveheart, I'll do the same. To put it simply, it makes Braveheart's cinematography look amateurish by comparison.
On top of the amazing cinematography, you have a completely immersive score. I never found it cheesy or manipulative, and I HATE manipulative scores (for example: Braveheart). What can I say about the story? It's a simple revenge story, but that really doesn't matter because the execution is so masterful. It's about death and redemption. My only complaint is that it seemed like some of the plot was cut out to make this more of a summer movie. I'm sure the dvd will fix the situation, though. Is this completely historically accurate? Of course not, and it doesn't pretend to be. It's a fictional tale, told in a historical setting. Demanding 100% historical accuracy from a movie that doesn't claim to be historically accurate is absurd and unfair.Overall, though, I don't really care what other people think about this movie. To me it is a work of art.",Gladiator
615,spinin,This movie kicked my butt!,10,6 June 2000,"""Gladiator"" is a very simple story. Most of the time, it is a typical war hero adventure. Sometimes it even appears stupid. The plot is not very complex and gets repetitive. The hero kills because he must and that is enough reason for him. He wants to avenge the death of his wife and his kid so he will plow through his enemies until he gets to the man responsible. When he does, he will save the day and all will be well. There are a bunch of other war adventure cliches in between the major plot events. Normally, no matter how compelling the story is, a simple war film will not win me over 100 percent. Although ""Gladiator"" is very one-dimensional and predictable at times, it surpasses other similar movies. Many elements contributed to grasp my attention and have me surrender to this adventure.As I said the story is simple. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) has just led Rome to yet another victory and the empire has expanded once again. The Caesar, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), is a dying man doubting what he has achieved for his people. Since he has such a close bond with his general he decides to change his mind and ask Maximus to become the next Caesar instead of Marcus Aurelius' incompetent son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). Maximus is a simple warrior that only wants one thing: to go home. He knows the exact number of days he has not seen his family. Although he loves Marcus Aurelius, he cannot imagine himself as the next leader of Rome. For that reason, Marcus Aurelius wants him to take over and bring happiness back to the people. As Maximus ponders whether to accept the offer, Commodus finds out about his father's decision. He is heart-broken and jealous and in his rage he murders his father. Quickly he announces himself as the next Caesar. Because Maximus is suspicious and not willing to serve his new leader, Commodus has him arrested and orders an execution. Similarly, he orders Maximus' family to be killed as well. While Maximus escapes, his loved ones are murdered and his house is burned down. The exiled general is eventually captured and bought by Proximo (Oliver Reed) who trains him and many others to be gladiators in a smaller province outside of Rome. Maximus quickly steals the hearts of many spectators and becomes their favorite. Back in Rome, the power hungry Commodus decides to bring gladiator games back to the people of Rome and so a confrontation between the young Caesar and Maximus is evident.Ridley Scott's direction sells this story. He uses dark lighting and vast settings to create a similar tone to the one in ""Blade Runner."" The darker mood is great in ""Gladiator."" Not all hero adventures such as this one have to maintain a mostly positive atmosphere. The storytelling is overwhelmingly powerful and very compelling. Dynamic cinematography is effectively used during all major battles and gladiator fights. The music is excellent. It just screams out at you. This simple tale is transformed into the most interesting and engaging picture of this year. Russell Crowe is great as Maximus. He portrays courage, honor, and anger with a warrior's mentality. His repetitive drive for vengeance is forgotten in the way this film is presented. Joaquin Phoenix is even better as Commodus. This is a confused man that wants power, but doesn't know how to get it or what to do with it. He expresses jealousy in sight of anyone who is more loved than he is. That is why he hates Maximus. He believes his father loved Maximus more than he loved him. He wants to feel love from the people of Rome; therefore he will do anything to please them. He wants to be loved by his sister, more than a sister should love her brother. He forces these things and they confuse him. Commodus is in pain and is blind to what he is doing. Ridley Scott makes sure Commodus' eyes are never quite visible in the film. They are always encircled by darkness or make-up. This is exactly the type of character that would be present in the future world of ""Blade Runner."" Phoenix's performance is Oscar worthy.Because of the performances, the beautiful music, the dark lighting, and the energetic cinematography the simple story of ""Gladiator"" evolves into an overpowering film. It's good to see a film set in a darker moodier ancient Rome instead of another World War II epic. It's also great to see a movie with so much energy and power that it makes you forget about its simple storyline. Many beautiful sequences in ""Gladiator"" make this film an unbelievable experience. It is tremendous and seems larger than life. ""Gladiator"" is better than, say, ""Braveheart"" simply because of its raw power. ""Braveheart"" was a great adventure that just wasn't enough in comparison. ""Gladiator"" is exceptional and surpasses other smarter films in the genre simply because of its overwhelming presence! It will absorb you with all its might. This film might be overlooked during the Oscars because it is another war epic, but hopefully it will get some recognition. ""Gladiator"" achieves greatness in its dark powerful storytelling and great direction by Ridley Scott. It will be one of the best films of the year. Thank you for making a predictable story burst out as if it was so much more. This movie kicks ass! Overall, a 10 out of 10!",Gladiator
616,timtindy,above average but far from great -- a 6 out of 10,6,4 May 2000,"Gladiator is an entertaining enough way to spend almost three hours, but it never manages to achieve the level of greatness that it so desperately aspires to. Russell Crowe as always adds a sure hand with his fine acting, but I felt the action scenes were a bit stagy.Joaquin Phoenix never convinced me he was a man corrupted by ambition.  It WAS nice though to see veteran actors Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed on the screen again.All in all, a movie worth seeing, but don't expect greatness.",Gladiator

619,Reviewer746,Facelift of 60's Sword-&-Sandal,5,17 October 2021,"I've always been confused by this film's popularity, especially among supposed history nerds. It rubs me the wrong way that so many people continue to compare Master & Commander unfavorably against Gladiator when this film is such a wreck and that one is such a masterpiece.The best thing about this film is the acting. I can't fault anyone involved. But that's where the accolades end. The dialogue is like something out of a comic book - simple and overly dramatic. The adventure elements are cut short to make room for the action, which is mostly just downright silly. The sets and costumes are comic-bookishly silly and anachronistic. The overly dramatic action score works fine for Pirates of the Caribbean, a comedy, but not so much when it's meant to be taken seriously - I honestly think this movie would have been better with less film score.It's hard to tell what's happening in the opening battle sequence. The Romans (wearing anachronistic armor, using stirrups, shooting fire arrows and employing ballistae and testudo in a field battle) appear to be fighting an army of at least a dozen Germans. The Roman battle lines immediately disintegrate into a classic Hollywood-style mêlée upon contact. The fighting involves extras tapping each other with their weapons in low-fps slow-mo. Sloppy combat between extras usually works fine in the background but not as the focus of each shot.The dialogue in the opening scenes after the battle is extremely poor. The script that sets up the plot of the whole movie reads just like a comic book. It's even worse than the original from which it was lifted almost wholesale (The Fall of the Roman Empire).Why are they using film score inspired by 18th century flamenco music to indicate to the audience that Maximus is from 2nd century Spain? The helmets in the colosseum are comically anachronistic and ahistorical.Commodus is an interesting historical figure. I can't help but feel that Gladiator wasted potential by opting to be nothing more than a sloppy, ahistorical amalgamation of 1960's Rome flicks retailored for modern audiences.",Gladiator
620,branflakes4547,Starts great but ultimately suffers from bad writing,8,2 July 2019,"I just want to say that I loves the first hour of this movie. The positives: the acting, the sound design, the special effects, gore, action scenes (sort of), and the production design. Thr negatives: the editing was horrendous, the script ranges from good to god awful, dialogue that feels like a B movie at certain points, and the bloody slow mo imperative to early 2000's movies. Overall it is a great prouction, and for the most part I enjoyed it. It had great scenes but overall it gets a little repititive and drags a bit with little to no story depth in the last hour of the film. Glad I watched it though",Gladiator

Needless to say, it's one of my all time favorite movies, and I believe it deserves all the popularity, awards and positive comments. Gladiator brings you all that you can possibly expect from its genre. It takes you to a different time and place and tells an epic fairy tale of a true hero. Director does justice to the plot and characters make the story proud. Russell Crowe is exceptionally great in this film with pure talent and amazing chemistry with his character, and in fact the whole cast seems perfect. All in all, this is a movie I'd gladly recommend to anyone without a doubt. It really is a classic of our time.",Gladiator

The fight scenes are excellent and the fact that a man could do what the main character did seems impossible. The production was great with epic proportions and worthy of an Oscar.The acting was good though at times fair. The power of the story and plot carries this movie. The scenes and confrontations are memorable and powerful. Russell Crowe did an excellent job convincing me he was who he was playing, but the best performance was put out by Oliver Reed. He was magnificent as the slave owner of the gladiators. I thought it was him when I first saw the character, but was not sure till the end credits as he protrayed the tough old gracious retired obviously successful gladiator of times gone by. The performances of the young emperor and his sister/concubine are not as powerful, but adequate. Richard Harris does a better than expected job as the old ceasar.If one can handle Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart you can handle this movie, though one gladiator fight sequence may out do what was in those movies.",Gladiator

The story is brilliant, the acting is outstanding, and the soundtrack is perfect.All of the acting performances are outstanding, but the most memorable performance is that of Russell Crowe. His performance here put him at the top of the Hollywood A-list, and he deserved the Best Actor award. He is riveting as Maximus, the Roman General who was betrayed. He was forced to become a slave, and then a gladiator. Some of the most memorable quotes come from the character of Maximus, such as 'My name is Gladiator'.Another outstanding performance is that of Connie Nielsen as Lucilla.The action scenes are well done, and extremely bloody, but this makes them more authentic.If you haven't seen this movie yet, you are missing out on one of the best movies ever made.Definately 10/10!",Gladiator

With an excellent story and outstanding acting, Gladiator is definitely the most popular movie to come out in 2000. The true Roman culture and life of a gladiator is displayed through the eyes of Ripley Scott (the director). You will definitely feel as though you are Roman when this film is finished. With a powerful enemy and a damsel in distress, this clearly is one of those true action movies that almost runs along a Walt Disney storyline. During a survey for the best movie movie to be out yet this year, 89% of the votes were for Gladiator.

As any historical movie fan, I was immensely impressed by the fight scenes. The movie should be credited with its success in the battle and hand to hand fight parts. It can be even said that Gladiator has the best ever ""arena - fight"" episodes. Sadly, this is all there is to this film. The entire movie is dull and apart from action parts you keep yawning and looking at your watch wondering when the next action scene starts. Weak dialogs and gloomy air is the reason for the downfall of Gladiator.

629,daryl42-1,"So emotionally strong and captivating that you will not take your eyes off the screen until it is over. Also, a movie for men.",8,3 June 2010,"8.6It is no secret that men love Gladiator. The film's protagonist is easily relatable to. He is not a rich man, nor a noble. He has a family and a bit of land. He doesn't ask for more than that. However, he is also a soldier. A very good and respected soldier, in fact. He is a general. However, he is still under the rule of a king. That authority oppresses him and takes away what little he had. He manages to gain his respect and recognition back, but he doesn't do this by performing superheroic acts. In fact, most of the time he has his head down. Yet, he is a strong man, one that is able to survive everything that is thrown at him. It is easy to see why Gladiator appeals to men.It also helps that the film is very engaging. The filmmakers take the approach that puts you in the shoes of the protagonist. The protagonist doesn't say much, and only responds in wholehearted mutterings. The film does a very good job of engaging the audience's emotions. Throughout the narrative, it is easy to be captured by the tale and not be able to break free until satisfaction is found. The conclusion of the film comes as a surprise, but it does so in a way that summons so much emotion from the audience that it doesn't leave them with a foul taste afterward.The cinematography in Gladiator is great. From the cold forest that the intro sequence takes place in, to the hot, golden scenes in the desert, almost every scene in Gladiator does a fine job of inviting the audience. There are some very powerful scenes in the movie, such as the sequences where someone is walking through a wheat field, and passing his hand through the wheat. My favorite part of the entire film is that this was included in the beginning of the movie, and not just at the end. The moments where Maximus, the protagonist is near to death, are done very well. There are some mesmerizing moments where he seems to be floating to the afterlife.Of course, Gladiator is not without its imperfections. The film doesn't focus too much on the whole Gladiation thing. I can see this being pretty disappointing to some audiences. However, the gladiatorial chapters are handled very well. Again, the filmmakers display incredible ability to involve audiences. Some of the characters are a little hard to believe, in terms of their actions. Namely, the king and his sister. Some of the things that they do and say are a little unbelievable. Not in the sense that it wouldn't happen, but in the sense that it feels out of place in the film, and it doesn't translate well to the screen. The film is also paced a bit weird. It feels like too much time is spent in the setup, that the middle of the film ends up suffering. Clocking in at about two and a half hours, it's very surprising to see that such little time was spent in the arena.Gladiator is a very powerful film. It has good performances, and an incredible job by the crew. The only thing that holds it back is ultimately the script. Watching the final product, it feels like the pacing is odd, and the script needed to be refocused on different aspects of the film. Still, the filmmaker's ability to strike up emotion in the audiences is the strongest point of the film. Most likely, the film will capture your attention and not let go until its conclusion. It is also a film that appeals greatly to men. Some people say that film-making is all about the story. I think what is more important than the actual content of the narrative, is the execution of it. Not the story itself, but the storytelling. Apparently, Ridley Scott and crew know very well how to tell a story.",Gladiator
630,what3v3r,Now Thats what I call Screen Magic !,10,3 August 2005,"I used to mumble ""Afterlife' a Joke"" till Gladiator happened. Now I start to wonder if my actions will in fact echo in my Afterlife ! Set in Ancient Rome, The Gladiator is everything spectacular that you can imagine about a movie of such epic proportions. Breathtaking visuals of the amphitheaters and of Rome itself will segue you into an ancient Roman realm. The grandeur of the ""games"" will just etch itself in your mind. And the afterlife concept and its depiction was really mind-blowing.USP 1: Dialogue! The Dialogue is everything that can be. It is Awe-Inspiring. It is Heart-Rending. It sends your Pulse-Racing and your hackles springing. I have watched this movie a zillion times now and have memorized every bit of verbal legerdemain that it has to offer. It is clearly exemplary in buttressing the already superior climaxes.USP 2: Russel Crowe - Welcoming you into a cesarean time , is a stubbled Russel Crowe breathtakingly wielding his sword first in battle as a reputed general ,then in the amphitheater as a slave and finally in the Collosuem as the Gladiator. Although the entire cast have a splendid acting performance, Crowe in particular is terrific. Makes it all the more challenging, as his character traverses a wide variety of emotions and situations. He also command a certain air of unnerving chivalry throughout the movie. His English accent goes really well with the movie and its resounding dialog.USP 3 : Hans Zimmer - Soundtrack! Hmm! How many times has it resonated in my ears ! Its brings the Afterlife to ...well ...life. It sets a super cadence to which you would pound your feat , drool your way through Elysiums and colloseums , enliven your emotions and indulge your senses. You could rerun the entire movie in your head with the soundtrack alone ! The sound track for the most part has a tinge of ""Gregorian"" and fittingly so too.USP 4 : Cinematography and Special Effects - Cinematography and Special effects are so outstanding, that without the aforementioned USP's the Colosseum scenes would have comprehensively eclipsed the rest of the movie. And the Academy certainly didn't disagree either. Of particular significance, is the portrayal of Afterlife which although is a complete human conception , tends to inculcate into the movie a sense of mysticism. This is exactly where the Cinematography is a huge success.It was really pleasing to witness ""The Gladiator"" make all the big snatches at the Academy Awards even against such stern competition as ""Traffic"" and ""Erin Brokovich"". The Gladiator doesn't fall short to make it to the established pedestals of movie making on any front. All in all, a ""Screen Magic""!",Gladiator

The battles were poorly shot and hard to watch, especially on the small screen. I must give credit where credit is due though. The film is very beautiful and the visual effects of Rome were very good.

Nothing more, nothing less.But - I was a little disappointed with Russel Crowe. He is a star in my eyes - a true actor. In this film he simply walks around with a goofy, bewildered expression on his face - and that's all the acting, he gives us. Joaquin Phoenix has a face of a villain.

Of the 2 and a half hours running time, there are really only 30-40 minutes of excitement. The rest is average at best and the ending is just ridiculous. THIS IS NOT A CLASSIC.

The opening battle scene was almost psychotronic in it's atmospherics...like a Roman version of Alien. Wow! I love this director. Russell Crowe has definitely arrived too. He takes charge immediately as a believable Maximus, a great general with character, courage and the loving loyalty of his men...men of one of history's greatest armies. (""When I give the signal, let loose hell."") This guy's an alpha-male with a capital alpha! The movie follows his destiny as he navigates the twists and turns of Roman politics, greed and power. He is betrayed by a vile dweeb, a dying Marcus Aurelius Ceasar's son, who orders Maximus and Max's wife and son killed. This succeeds for the family but Max escapes and is spun off on a Jean Valjean-like journey of redemption and obscured identity. Except instead of becoming a mayor, he becomes...you guessed it...a Gladiator. Apparently, he is a gifted scrapper and builds quite a reputation. He comes to Rome and settles up the score. Riveting. Engaging. Awesome. The acting is superb. The script is intelligent and marvelously credible considering the difficulty scriptwriters have with historical movies, at least as far as I'm concerned. And it is terrific history! Very accurate. This presupposes that I know some Roman history...well, of course, I do. It had some tragedy which my companion (my wife) always finds intollerable and of course I gave her my standard speech about how film is not always supposed to make you feel warm and fuzzy but rather challenged and sometimes jolted. And as usual, it was hopeless. No way any movie gets an Oscar vote from my wife when kids get killed. However, she made me proud by brightly acknowledging that the violence was not gratuitous, in fact she said ""it was necessary to the advancing story arc and was done tastefully."" At this point, I felt some pride from how well she had learned her Film 101 lessons.

I personally believe that is something to admire, being so serious all the time. We don't see Russell smiling or laughing a lot, but that doesn't affect his acting skills at all.Crowe did an excellent job as Maximus in this movie, Gladiator. The rest of the cast was very good, including Joaquin Phoenix, who surprised me with his great performance.The plot is pretty good, I wouldn't say it's VERY entertaining, it has some very few dialogues that could be considered boring, but overall, it's a great script.The recreation of the ancient Rome is just excellent. The architecture of the buildings and The Coliseum is just fantastic. People in charge of that deserve a lot of credit and recognition.The movie could be considered long (over 150 minutes), and some people might find a few scenes boring, but generally the movie keeps the viewers paying attention all the time. The fight scenes were very good, people who aren't big action fans might enjoy watching this film (though it's not completely action, a little drama too).Crowe's character in here is very interesting. It's the kind of person that expresses the kind of feelings that make you think he doesn't fear anything, he always knows what to do next and he thinks the right way. While watching the film you get to like the character.The ending is tragic but at the same time happy. The ""bad guy"" dies and the ""good guy"" wins, but something that maybe people weren't expecting, the good guy dies too. Maximus takes revenge, killing the Caesar, and then he dies, but if you think carefully, you'll notice that he actually wanted to die, to be together with his wife and son again, in the life after death.This was a good movie. It's not the kind of movie that really ""gets into you"" and causes strange feelings and such (not many movies do that), but it's a good film and certainly worth watching.

The deafening roar of the crowd, the clash of steel, and the incredible visuals on a huge screen drew me into the movie like no other film has.Pretty much everything about this movie is amazing from start to finish. My only warning is that some scenes may be a little to brutal or graphic for some people (I know even I cringed a couple of times) and you might be a little careful who you watch this with. Ahh, who cares! The experience'll probably do them good. 9/10 on My Personal Scale.",Gladiator
650,lspaiser,A very good movie - in spite of its grand spectacle style,8,25 August 2005,"Gladiator is 2 1/2 hours long and I watched it in two parts. I agree completely with ""gregatory"" (another reviewer - see that review) in most respects.Russel Crowe is clearly one of the greatest actors alive today. His role here is nothing short of that. Also the description of the almost impossibly gory battle scene in the beginning (as well as the gladiator scenes later), could be trivial blood and gore performances. But they are not. It is clear how brutal these things were, but the craft the the producers use to portray them makes them sensible and tolerable. What we see is the horror of war - even before anybody had a gun or cannon or bomb.Frankly, I was put off by the performance of Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. He played a despicable and weak, palsied man so well it seemed his acting was equally bad. It annoyed me and I almost panned the movie for that. But I believe that was a personal bias. Apparently the role was just that - awful, the man was awful, that is.The second part (for me) fit together with the plot and was quite credible. Still the movie lacked something to make it absolutely great. It was also somewhat predictable - not an ingenious plot.So I rate it as very very good (8 points) but not great. As I mentioned though, Russel Crowe is great. I think, like Clint Eastwood, he is typecasting himself. His role and performance does remind me of Capt. Jack Aubrey in Master and Commander.He is definitely the Commander.",Gladiator
651,ericendres,One big 'meh'...,6,7 February 2002,"Ay, carumba... I was looking forward to this film, as I generally like these types of films, and I was thinking it would contain some epic qualities of action, intrigue, characterization, etc. However, this was one big 'meh', and I ended up regretting the time it took to watch over a few days during my lunch hour!The picture just wasn't very exciting or interesting. There was nothing in it that I didn't expect to happen as I watched it. The characters were predictably bland. Even the fight scenes were rather ho-hum. Just a lot of bashing and blood, which is probably what it really was like, but you know, in a film, you expect some more kind of essence or drama to it. The final fight between Maximus and Commodus? Who cared, by that point? There was very little artistry or drama to something that should have been quite a powerful confrontation... I agree with Roger Ebert's review that the look of it was very dark and bland and depressing, both visually and in terms of character.What's really baffling is how this was awarded best picture of the year, and Crowe as best actor, and that what's his name playing Commodus was even nominated for an Oscar! Yikes. I mean, I suppose it may have been a weak year, and you certainly can't count on the Best Picture being the 'best picture', but you expect it to at least have something significant to it. This had very, very little to it. I think of just two years ago, when the Best Pic noms were - Shakespeare in Love, Life is Beautiful, Saving Private Ryan, Elizabeth and Thin Red Line. Every one of those movies had so much more to them than this film does. It's almost ridiculous, the difference there. Not to mention others that weren't even nominated that year, like Truman Show and Gods and Monsters...Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix (that's his name!) were both rather unspectacular, mumbling their way through their lines like David Mamet's mock GREAT ACTOR would. (It's no wonder they were rewarded so!) They just didn't really cement themselves into those roles, particularly Phoenix. I can think of several others who could have done that part, and might have been more interesting. Then again, it could have been the direction, or the script, but his character actually seemed to have some of the more interesting things to say, so that probably rules that out. And it's not so much that Crowe was bad in the part, but it just wasn't that much of a part. He fights, he looks veangeful and sad, he mumbles a few lines, he fights some more, he longs for his family, fights some more... Not all that much to dig into, really. I haven't seen The Insider or A Beautiful Mind yet, but I must imagine that there's a lot more for him to have been 'best actor' for in those characters and films.There were some little things here and there that were alright, and some of the minor characters did well, but on the whole, a pretty big waste of time to watch...-EE-",Gladiator

I wouldn't rate Gladiator up there with Braveheart, that's why I say it's a mix.  The 13th warrior had plenty of action, but it lacked a central theme and a strong character.  Gladiator has these faults to a lesser degree, and it has the same muddy look to it.  It is a good film...just not a great one.  So, if you liked the 13th warrior then you'll like this film, but if you think 13th warrior was a little shallow and convoluted, then chances are you'll come out of this movie with similar thoughts.",Gladiator
658,jcpdiesel21,Great movie? Yes! Best picture? Hmmmm...,7,28 April 2001,"I saw Gladiator last May and really enjoyed it.  I have never seen a movie of this scope and dealing with this subject, so I thought that it was original for today's types of movies.  I am a big fan of Russell Crowe and thought that he did a great job in the title role of Maximus.  He is a very strong character who follows his own path and ideas, but shows a tender side in his desire to be with his family.  The majority of the cast was great, especially Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus.  He has a very strong talent and will be sure to make an impact in movies in the future.  However, I thought that Connie Neilsen's Lucilla was a bit weak and while she did display some independence in her actions and thoughts, she still held true to the standards of typical women's roles.  While I did think that the movie was great, it was hardly the best picture of 2000... but I'm not sure what would be instead.  It was a fairly weak year for the movies in comparison with recent years, especially 1999.  It was nice to see Russell Crowe win the Oscar for best actor, but he should have received it LAST year for his stirring portrayal of Jeffrey Wigand instead of Maximus.  His performance in Gladiator was excellent, but somehow it did not measure up to his former role.  I still believe that Tom Hanks was robbed for not getting an Oscar instead!7/10",Gladiator
659,cowboyerik,Greatest Sorta True Story Ever Told; Most GLORIOUS!,10,17 May 2000,"Gladiator, is the greatest story ever told. The greatest and most glorious film ever created without a doubt. If you have no appreciation for history, your ancestors, or the course of mankind, your family or yourself, you might not like this film.Gladiator should serve notice to mankind, of what in fact, mankind is not. No honor, no glory, no wisdom as well as many other faults. Today, commercials, radio, cash and campaign managers determine our leaders. Not for accomplishments or ability but for status and figure head. Gladiator, depicts Rome, and a few leaders in a time of great corruption and mis-guidance of central authority.Gladiator illustrates the price of Roman restoration, and what it will cost the United States, to restore our leadership in all branchs of government, except possibly the Judicial Branch. Our leaders are immoral, corrupt, and ride on the backs of others. No mater the party affiliation, sex and money(Democrats), or Iran-Contra/Coke/or the ruininous state of Texas(Republicans), all are corrupt, and frankly only SANDBAG the government our people need. Anyone see stats/statistic on Texas, it is the most toxic state in the country! Thank you Gov. Bush. Florida beachs don't smell to good this year either, more like sewage.Gladiator inspires the mind, even after viewing 4 times, it is still compelling both emotional and morally.

There aren't too many screen actors that can be on the screen and you can imagine them leading an army or hoard of men with their strong wills, courage, and personality, Crowe has this screen charisma. Errol Flynn had this and the list is very short, no, not even Mel Gibson did it in Braveheart.

I must say that I've always been an ancient history buff and I was into war-gaming when I was a teenager and into my early twenties. So, I had to do some reading about ancient warfare tactics and what have you. Now, the opening battle scene was a delight. It really gave me perspective on why the Roman army was so superior to most other armies of the time. Historically, the Romans relied on heavy artillery as a first hit and continued until the armies clashed. By then, their foes where already exhausted scared to death. This opening scene really made me see it happen.That said, now let's talk about the movie. It was so entertaining. I was genuinely pleased throughout the whole movie. It was visually dazzling, well acted and all in all just plain lovely.So why didn't I give it a ten? The story was just not 100% convincing however entertaining the movie was. But although I found the young Caesar's story slightly unbelievable, it did in a way reflect the lunacy that the rulers of the era where famous for.A word about the actors: they all played their parts exceedingly well and all the parts suited them perfectly. Russel Crowe was truly great, Richard Harris was indeed Caesar and Connie Nielsen was edible (wink, wink... what can I do, I absolutely love her?!) I can't really go on about everyone in that movie, but I can say that every single one was just great.",Gladiator

666,Costu-2,Wow! and again I say WOW!,9,10 June 2000,"Every so often, a film comes along that seems to have just about everything : a compelling story, incredible acting, fine sets and costumes and music. And -Gladiator- is such a film. Russell Crowe gives an extraordinarily textured performance as the central character Maximus, a warrior-poet who chooses private life over public ambition and then finds his world turned upside down. (IMHO, Mr. Crowe should have been the winner of this year's Best Actor Oscar for his work in -The Insider- ; the performance he gives here merely serves to reinforce that conviction.) Connie Nielsen is radiant as Lucilla, daughter to the late emperor Marcus Aurelius (finely played by Richard Harris). Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, and the late Oliver Reed also deserve kudos for their performances. But it is Joaquin Phoenix whom I found the most intriguing. His Commodus is that film rarity : a ""round"" villain...if indeed that word even applies in this case. The character's motivations can be understood, and, even if the choices Commodus makes cannot be approved, at least one can sympathize with the twistedness foisted upon him that leads to such choices.

669,spottedreptile,"Rousing entertainment with subtexts you can engage with, or not. .as you please",8,7 May 2000,"Gladiator is one of those rare films that does not depend on one single knock-em-dead effect or device. It's like a great meal you really enjoy without noticing one individual ingredient. Hence it's rather difficult to take it apart.Firstly it's great entertainment. This is a film designed to entertain, something many studios and directors have forgotten how to do in search of the Great Message that will change the World. You could almost call it a 'people's film' just as Maximus becomes the people's hero.
The analogies in the film to modern life can be taken as far as you like without spoiling your enjoyment of the story and the spectacle you engage in. Entrepreneurs, the Olympics, sport-as-war, war-as-entertainment, public image creation, it's all there if you want to philosophise about modern spectacle.  But Gladiator is still a good story about a deprived hero setting out to Get Even with the usurper who knocked him down. It sounds hackneyed but Ridley Scott knows how to get your emotions really inside the story so you care about the characters. It's really Russell Crowe's movie. He's so dominant and so bloody good. However he doesn't steal the film from other characters, which is another measure of a great actor. Joaquin Phoenix gives a very insightful interpretation of a man who just doesn't get it, who can't work out the secret of how to win love and how to be powerful where it matters most. He's not a stereotypical villain, but this does not detract from the film's impact, rather it enhances it. The supporting cast are just as good and it's an eclectic blend of accents and styles but it works. Actually I found it refreshing to hear Australian, English, American and European all together - it made the film more universal.The pacing of Gladiator is excellent. Despite the early fight scene I found my involvement built up slowly until I was hooked about half an hour in. The Germania battle I found distracting, only because I hate dropped frames and I don't think Scott does this as well as Spielberg did in Private Ryan. It's well-intentioned but I found it irritating.Violence was controlled and in context and worked very well. This is after all a battle epic. The choice of film stock sometimes came to the fore a bit more than I liked - I felt it was overdone. But on an emotional level this film worked beautifully for me. Like the Colosseum audience, I cheered for Maximus and booed for Commodus. It was fun. The ending was appropriate given all that Maximus had lost.  I didn't feel cheated or deprived. I felt I saw what I came to see and got a bonus.
The subtexts you can take or leave as you wish. Gladiator doesn't force them down your neck. But if you want to engage at a philosophical as well as a visceral level, then you can. A rare achievement. Ole Scott, Ole Crowe. Ole Gladiator.",Gladiator

From his excellent Sword-work to his well-tuned voice, he more than accuratly portrayed a man tormented by the loss of his Emperor, the loss of his family, and the loss of his freedom, both to Slavery and a Tyrannical Dictator.  The film looked very authentic, ranging from the gruesome but realistic battles and Gladiator matches to showing what Ancient Rome might have looked like at the height of it's power and glory.If I sat on the Academy, I would have to definately give this film a lot of nominations for Best Picture, Director, and Actor.

At other times I thought I was watching BRAVEHEART MEETS THE PATRIOT MEETS SPARTACUS. I was never really drawn in to the Russell Crowe character, in fact, I felt more sympathy for Comodius than Maximus.While the slashing and chopping is entertaining in a sort of WCW way, it seemed contrived and obligatory. As a history lesson it ranks right next to MONTY PYTHON'S SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL.

This movie should have been a masterpiece with these marvelous actors, big budget, talented director.When I first saw ""Gladiator"", the one thing I didn't like was ending. in ending scene the whole theater starts laughs. too cheesy to touch. How could Lucilla and the people let Roman Emperor's dead body abandoned like that? I think there's lack details of how brutal, devilish the emperor was. and how much the people in Rome hated their emperor.Joaquin Phoenix was the most outstanding part to me.

675,Bunty-at-IMDB,Are you not entertained?,9,4 May 2011,"If you're not, then watch this film. After quite a long time, I have seen a film which is near-perfect. Outstanding story, outstanding acting, direction, music, production design, cinematography, editing and what not.The film is a fictionalized account of life of a Roman General Maximus, whose family is murdered (crucified), he himself is ordered to be hanged, all thanks to evil emperor Commodus. However, the destiny had other plans, he is turned into slave, into gladiator and ultimately he is fated to avenge his family.Probably Ridley Scott's best film, his magnificent vision of ancient Rome and focused direction is something to be applauded. His way of story telling has unique style to it. He got almost all things right - ranging from costumes to acting, sets to cinematography.While film's story sounds like some classical Shakespeare tragedy, David Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson manage to give the script a cinematic edge. Although the film suffers some schmaltzy dialogs here and there, but it is engaging enough to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat.The film's sheer USP is the lead actors - Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix. Viewers feel the vengeance and sorrow of Maximus. Crowe's portrayal of Maximus is very humanly. Crowe manages to show the most complicated complex emotions in a very effortless way. But for me, Joaquin Phoenix took the cake away for his Commodus - he is as evil as a Satan but the same time, we all feel for him. Sometimes he behaves as if he is a sociopath, but again, he behaves as if he is not loved. Phoenix's pure acting talent will leave you spellbound.Apart from above, the film features amazing score by Hans Zimmer. The tracks ""Wheat"" and ""Progeny"" are completely haunting and they echo to your ears even after the film is over. The film features beautiful photography by John Mathieson, which is, of course, is highly color graded, but still, gorgeous none-the-less. Production Design by Arthur Max is breath-taking - you are really immersed into the 180 AD Rome.Another thing worth mentioning is the visual effects used in the film - the complete re-creation of the time-period, the digital reconstruction of Colosseum and of course the CGI tigers - are all outstanding, and it is very well justified why the film won Oscar for Visual Effects.In the end, Gladiator is highly entertaining, and at times, tear jerking film which is extremely well-made, fueled with great acting of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.

Phoenix is such an awesome evil character in this movie and Crowe epitomizes the ideals of a military republican, dedicated to his country and leaders, fighting for what is right.The only thing that I could complain about is I'm not sure how gore-laden nor vulgar the non-TV version is, but I'd definitely watch the edited version because who needs all that extra junk that makes the DVD R-rated in the first place?!I could write for days about how many great things are included in this movie, but I'll just keep it short and say that it ROCKS!",Gladiator

I watched it, then watched all the special features on the second disc, and ended not getting to bed until about 2 in the morning. Russell Crowe may have been noticed by Hollywood in L.A. Confidential, but this is the movie that made him a STAR. He is amazing, going from strong and forceful Roman General, to showing remorse for his wife and child, accepting his fate as a slave, then realizing that he has a chance to go to Rome and perhaps extract his revenge on the evil Commodus. This is not just a guy movie, as there is alot of emotion in it. Love, loss, happiness, and more... This is now my favorite movie of all time. If you havent seen it, RENT IT AND WATCH IT.

680,Vince-40,Ridley is one of my favorite directors only because of the visuals!,8,15 May 2000,"Well Ridley Scott is the director of 2 of my favorite movies of all time, Alien and Blade Runner. I also like Thelma and Louise.I think that Gladiator is a good film, but not a great one. I think that it doesn't beat Thelma and Louise (the film seems to be very underated because everybody said that Gladiator is Scott's best film since Blade Runner or even Alien).Ridley Scott's good sense of casting is casting is very present in Gladiator and he knows who to direct an actor.Russell Crowe is very good : I mean he is Maximus ! But I think that the best performance is give by Joaquin Pheonix (maybe it is because his character (Commodus) is the most developed in the film). Pheonix is so incredible that he steal every scenes that he appears !!! Connie Nielsen is impressive has the frightened sister of his younger brother. She is also very beautiful !The supporting actors are very good too begining with Richard Harris who gives a very credible performance. The late Oliver Reed's first lines are funny and he is also credible. Djumon Hounsou (sorry for the wrong spelling) is good too, but I think that we don't see him too often. Derek Jacobi is always very good. Spencer Treat Clark give a very good young performance as Lucius.Now technically the film is impressive. The camera works are well done and the cinematography (Ridley's force) is outstanding! Some may not apreciate the effect during the battle scenes. I think that it is a kind of violence censure. The violence is often suggested more than shown. It could have been a lot more gory ! So I think that the fast editing is a good thing, but I was disapointed the first time that I saw the movie (I've seen it twice). The score is very good. Hans Zimmer deserved to be in the Top 10 greatest and prolific Hollywood composers. The score: The Rock meets The Thin Red Line: 8.5/10 . The CGI effects disappointed me in the first viewing, but it grow on me the on the second viewing!Ridley Scott's direction is NOT at his best but the actors are very well directed and Scott's vision of Rome is well represented. The themes in Gladiator are a bit similar to the themes of Blade Runner, but here stop my comparision with that masterpiece. Surprisingly, there is a ""intimate feel"" in that film and that feels good to have Ridley back! (Unfortunatly his next is going to be bad (""Hannibal"" staring Sir Anthony Hoptkins, Julianne Moore, Gary Oldman and Ray Liota). Ok maybe not, but I have a bad feeling about it! Ridley's cinematography (with the help of cinematographer John Mathiesen) is impressive and he really shows his influences of David Lean. The shots in Morocco remind me a lot of Lawrence of Arabia !I think that the weakest point of the film is the story. It is not very weak, but it is cliché and there are a lot of deja vu espacially if you had seen Braveheart two days before ! The characters are not very deep and there are some little plot holes.Well, I think that it is the Hollywood film that you must see this summer if you only want to watch one, but don't expected a masterpiece it is not. ...A kind of Titanic movie...8/10",Gladiator
681,PreOre72,Amazing!,10,8 May 2000,"`What you do in lifeit goes an eternity'; Roman General Maximus (Russell Crowe) says to his legions of men, to rile them up, before they battle a horde of barbarians. 	 The opening sequence in Ridley Scott's new Roman epic has beautiful captivating shot of the destruction from overhead with the flaming arrows flying through the air, great sound, and Crowe to give inspirational speeches to set the whole mood for the next two and a half hours. 	 The $103 million film follows Maximus after he is betrayed by Commodus, portrayed brilliant by Joaquin Phoenix, son of the late emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) who wanted Maximus to take over his empire and restore power to the senate.  Well, Commodus would hear none of this so he ridded of Maximus and took care of his evidence of living.  After Commodus takes over Maximus begins his quest for vengeance.  Oh yeah, the audience is excited because Russell Crowe is Maximus in yet another impressive performance, following 1997's `L. A. Confidential' and his Oscar nominated performance in 1999's `The Insider'. 	 `Gladiator' has all the right components for an amazing epic with some new directorial twists by Scott.  The acting is flawless in all aspects, the soundtrack is captivating, the writing is precise, the cinematography is stunning, and the action sequences are uncanny. 	 We've got blood, gore, action, writing, direction, cinematography, special effects, big name actors, a gigantic budget, and historical inaccuracy. We've got the 21-century's spin on a dead genre of film, the Roman epic. 	 All in all, one of the most exciting and satisfying films in recent years and the best one to kick off 2000's summer blockbuster season.10/10",Gladiator
682,Gordon-38,Such a Mixed Bag,5,21 June 2000,"I absolutely love Ridley Scott.  ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner"" both rank among my favorite films.  ""Gladiator,"" though, just didn't work for me.Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, and really ought to be a big, big, big star.  Unfortunately, he's not given much to do here.  He fights, he broods, he whines...but he's never really forced to stretch his talents.My main quibble, I suppose, is that the movie was clearly going for ""Braveheart"" effect, and it fails.  It was easy to get some sympathy going for Mel Gibson's character in ""Braveheart.""  He was fighting for freedom and justice.  Sadly for ""Gladiator,"" it's pretty hard to develop much sympathy for any particular faction within the Roman empire.  Where ""Braveheart"" was able to give us a few effective hallucinations and dream sequences, ""Gladiator"" shoves it down our throat with oddly-colored, tripping-on-acid dream sequences every five minutes.  Yes, we get the point.  He misses his family, and he'll see them in the afterlife.  Move on already!Apart from the dream sequences, the movie does look pretty spectacular.  The Colliseum is an impressive sight.  The costumes, for once in a sword-and-sandal epic, don't look like the costume department simply raided the bedding department at K-Mart.  And the fight scenes are, indeed, entertaining and visceral.In the end, though, the movie is less than the sum of its parts.",Gladiator
683,PJ-52,When in Rome...,9,8 May 2000,"This film reaches some fantastic heights here are my personal highlights:1. When Maximus(Russell Crowe) reveals himself to Commodus(Joaquin Phoenix) after his first victory in the colosseum. 2. The battle in the colosseum: Maximus versus the undefeated gladiator and the lions.3. The final duel in the colosseum. This was not a long duel, and was represented realistically. An untrained Emperor versus a highly experienced wounded Maximus.4. ...and any other battle scene in between.Gladiator looks good, sounds good, and really lifts you, that is you want to be Maximus and avenge the wrongs which have been dealt upon you. A classic good versus evil story.",Gladiator
684,DaWeas007,EXCELLENT MOVIE!!!!,10,8 May 2000,"I can sum up the experience of Gladiator in one word, AWESOME!!!!! My friend and I went to see it recently and both of us being refined movie critics gave it two big thumbs up, if I could, I'd have voted a 11+ for Gladiator. The action sequences and the visual effects were second to none and there wasn't a point in the movie where I wasn't urning for the next scene to find out what was going to happen! It also leaves us with an important message; It shows us that if an extraordinary man such as Russel Crowe's character (the general) can be humble, kind, unselfish, and save the world (in this case Rome), than there is hope for everyone to do good in their own lives and help the world in some way. Very well done indeed overall and I'd definitely recommend this to any moviegoer looking to wisely spend 2 1/2 hours of his/her time.",Gladiator
685,Lil'Girl,Sword Wielding Fest,8,7 May 2000,"Okay, I enjoyed it in spite of the blood, body count and gore (or maybe because of it). It was well-paced and well-acted. The fight scenes were satisfactory and Russell Crowe looked liked he did know how to hold a sword. This viewer still doesn't know what to think of the ending... seems rather bizarre to me. I guess it was necessary for the two foes to come to a head but I'm not sure that it was entirely convincing to do it in the way it was done. Still I enjoyed the performances of several decent British actors and of course, Russell Crowe is always stunning.",Gladiator
686,gstiger,"Gladiator is a slightly flawed, but never the less entertaining, blockbuster.",8,29 May 2001,"Gladiator provided one of the very few enjoyable movie-going experiences of 2000.David H. Franzoni's screenplay is adequate. It's clichéd and doesn't introduce any new ideas or concepts to the genre but it is still entertaining. The cast does a fairly nice job at giving life to their roles. Russell Crowe does a great at putting the human back in the hero in his role as Maximus. He does a good job at bringing ferocity and nobility to the character of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is pretty good as the disturbed villain, Commodus. Some of Joaquin's more emotional scenes are a little over the top and hammy, though. Oliver Reed is wonderful at bringing a hardness and edge to the character of Proximo. Connie Nielsen and Richard Harris also give commendable performances.Hans Zimmer's score is fantastic. During the battle scenes it is effectively powerful and energetic and during the more dramatic scenes it is very sorrowful and mournful.The set and costume designs in Gladiator are very good; they bring out the splendor and glory that was ancient Rome. The CGI effects are acceptable but sometimes it is evident that the images seen on the screen were generated from a computer. Ridley Scott is in top form as usual; the film carries his wonderful stylistic flare.Pietro Scalia's editing, and Scott's direction brings the grisly battle scenes to life. Scalia utilizes quick cuts for the battle scenes, which prove to be very effective. His editing does falter however; at times the film tends to drag on a bit too long. John Mathieson's cinematography is one of the films poorer qualities. The camera movement is occasionally too bumpy and some of the images appear to be too murky and dirty. Overall, Gladiator is a good film; one of the few enjoyable films of 2000.",Gladiator
687,arbarnes,OLD HOLLYWOOD MEETS NEW HOLLYWOOD,7,17 July 2000,"The great thing about GLADIATOR is the way in which the film combines elements of the classic Hollywood epic with a modern style. It is both respectful of the tradition  to which it belongs,  and bold enough to step in a new direction. It is not simply a remake of FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE (though outwardly the story is virtually the same), but a combination of all the great Roman epics that graced the screen during the fifties and sixties. You have the gladiator school from SPARTACUS, the horrors of the Colosseum from QUO VADIS, the burning conflict between two former allies from BEN HUR, and countless other references to what we have seen before. But, as well as being an example of solid  golden Hollywood storytelling the film is stylistically very much of the age. The epic as a genre invariably stretched the scope of film-making, being at the forefront of the latest technical innovations -be they in colour development, sound, format (eg. CinemaScope) or, as with GLADIATOR, computer-generated imagery. But at the heart of any epic is the conflict between (usually) two opposing forces, represented by two characters. And no matter how fine the effects, the art direction and the staging, it is this conflict that must grab our attention. In GLADIATOR, the characters of Commodus and Maximus represent the two opposing forces of insecurity and stability. The dynamics of this conflict, so wonderfully presented by Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe, are classical in form, though with many ambiguities and cadences that make their conflict far more than a simple battle between good and bad. It is in this aspect that GLADIATOR takes a bold step in using classic Hollywood tradition (goodie versus baddie) to unravel and show the complexities of its characters and their dilemmas. This is a successful strategy because the film holds our interest throughout because of the psychology of the protagonists as much as the grandeur of the staging. Simply big is never enough -there has to be a very identifiable human conflict for the film to be personal too. GLADIATOR is both epic and personal.The film boasts a number of fine performances. Carrying on the Hollywood convention of having English actors play Romans is an echo of past epics -a reverent ploy. Joaquin Phoenix, though American, speaks with a British accent too ..Roman emporers in Hollywood films invariably did so! Such details give a sense of nostalgia, or at least recognition -always a key factor in genre films. Another example of genre convention is the ""bad but loveable"" supporting character, in this case played by Oliver Reed. He is an instant reminder of the sheikh in BEN HUR or Peter Ustinov's character in SPARTACUS, and serves the same purpose.The effects are fortunately never allowed to get before the conflict of the story, but one cannot write about GLADIATOR without mentioning them. I have always been sceptical of computer generated imagery, and I think there is still some way to go before I believe ""totally"" what I see on screen, but GLADIATOR shows a historical accuracy both in the battle scenes and in those in the Colosseum, which can only be commended. I only wish the film had been made and presented in 70mm, for if ever a picture in recent years demanded it, then it was this.",Gladiator
688,sal_ruggiero,Russell Crowe gives another great performance!,9,1 August 2000,"Gladiator is an awesome movie with an awesome cast and an awesome director. Starring Russell Crowe in one of his better roles, Gladiator combines the blood/violence of Saving Private Ryan, the story of a Ben-Hur type deal and grand acting to create a web of decite, lies, fights, and death.Russell Crowe is a well respected general - Maximus. The beginning is like Saving Private Ryan, where the barbarians and the Roman fight each other until one of the sides happens to fall, (the barbarian Germans.) Maximus, after the battle, meets with the emperor who tells him that he is dying and giving the empire to his control. When the emperor's son hears the news, he tries to do all he can do to get the crown (played by Joaquin Pheonix.)In order to gain control, the emperor's son takes the lives of Maximus's son and wife. Maximus becomes a slave/gladiator and learns from one of the best gladiators of all time to regain his freedom - he has to win the spectators before he can win the emperor. Later in the story, Maximus meets up with the new emperor in the Colloseum and the story goes from there.Russell Crowe gives another Academy Award worthy performance. Gladiator is one of the best films of the new millennium!",Gladiator
689,donahue-1,A grand epic  told by a master storyteller.,10,13 August 2003,"A grand epic  told by a master storyteller. Sit back and watch a master ply his craft. As noted by previous reviewers - director Ridley Scott's cinematic masterpiece explodes onto the screen with the force of Spielberg's `Saving Private Ryan'  with the best battle scenes since Gibson's Braveheart.
This film is an epic tale of one man's loyalty, betrayal and revenge - - against the backdrop of Rome at the height of her glory  and brutality. Director Scott weaves an intricate fabric paralleling one man's fight for justice  and a nation's struggle for freedom  both cumulating in the final battle between one just man and the deific ambitions of a megalomaniacal Cesar.  Sit back too  and take a lesson in acting from the old master Richard Harris.  His `whispers' are more powerful than another man's battle cries. 
Then too  take a lesson in acting from the new masters Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix.  These two actors can do more with a glance or a tilt of their head  than most actors can do with their whole bodies. 
Last but not least  was Spielberg's Dreamworks  being the icing on the cake.  Director Scott was exceedingly careful in not making that all too familiar mistake of letting the special effects overpower the story line. DreamWorks' `unleashing hell' in the opening battle scenes  through to the recreation of the Coliseum in all of her terrible splendor was truly captivating.  Throughout  there was not one weak link throughout the movie.  Supporting actors and actresses were the best in the business.  Derek Jacobi and Connie Nielson never disappoint.  Plus  I'm at a loss for words to describe the visual impact of Ralf Moeller and Sven-Ole Thorsen.On a parting note and in scanning some previous comments   I'd like to observe that those folks  who have been nurtured on Kung Fu flicks - - will be understandably disappointed in a film of this depth and breadth  and realism.   In summary  a truly captivating and entertaining movie - - with perhaps its greatest strength being that it forces one to give ample pause to reflect on one's own life and life goals.",Gladiator
690,gopal4320-840-668506,Story telling at its best,10,18 November 2013,"Although this film has many great actors it was Crowe and Connie Nielsen who give it heart. Crowe's presence fills the auditorium and convinces the audience important events are taking place. Crowe pulls you to his side and you root for him almost from the start of the film.This work is his finest from his appearance as the fierce but reluctant general who was a farmer at heart to his work as the brilliant, unstoppable gladiator warrior to the final scenes when he finally faces the man he has cursed and vowed to kill. He defies an emperor. The Emperor is a yellow-livered, depraved poor excuse for a human being but he is no pushover. He is a weak but determined worm of a man who knows what he wants and how to get it. He is ruthless and selfish in attaining his goals, always wrong-headed but unrelenting in his pursuit of satisfying his twisted desires. What he wants he takes with no respect for others.The movie culminates in a life and death contest between Crowe and the emperor and at times the outcome seems in doubt.The film was lush and stunning representation of Imperial Rome and the action, both on the battlefield and in the colosseum, is both beautiful and compelling. This movie contains almost no historical truths but this quickly becomes a matter of ""who cares?"" ""Gladiator"" is story telling at its best and whether the naysayers, and there are many, like it or not, ""Gladiator"" is destined be a classic.Connie Nielsen brings a strong and pure feminine energy to the film and her final scene, while melodramatic, will remain firmly established in my mind as one of my favorite movie memories.Could anyone have played the emperor better than Joaquin Phoenix? Possibly but could anyone else have given us greater insight into the twisted soul of the emperor? Could anyone else have allowed us to actually feel compassion for the tortured psyche of the emperor? I don't know but Phoenix did all that and gave us a portrayal of a man driven mad by his obsessions.",Gladiator
691,Billybobble1,My favourite film ever amongst true greats,10,30 October 2019,"I have given this and Dunkirk 10/10, both films without fail make me cry like a baby and I have a heart of stone. It is very hard to justify 10/10 but for their sheer consistency in manipulating my emotions I cannot fault either film. They are both the epitome of filming excellence and should be observed as such.Gladiator has been my favourite film almost since it came out, I say almost as like any true work of art, I didn't necessarily absorb it's full clout on first viewing, which to me is not only okay, it's a testament to great film (on first viewing I didn't get American Psycho at all, 2nd viewing I saw it's excellence).I do believe you should not give 10/10 reviews but there has to be exceptions when it is truly deserved and this is one of those few times. I have an ability to pick holes in almost any film I watch, I have to say almost as in this, I can not. If I HAD to pick a hole, almost 20 years later it would be the cgi, which is pretty much flawless.I don't review with spoilers or hints at plot, I prescribe to advising why this is a necessary part of your film education.
Put simply, with this film, if you have not seen it and/or have no opinion of it, you're opinion means nothing to me. It's that simple.",Gladiator

694,alex-306,Worth seeing in the theater,8,1 June 2000,"I expected Gladiator to be mediocre thematically, perhaps a cross between The Matrix and Spartacus.  As it turned out, I was pleasantly surprised. Although I cannot give this film an overwhelmingly positive endorsement, it certainly is worth checking out in a theater.  Its greatest strength is, of course, the visual effects.  Ancient Rome is recreated so beautifully that my jaw literally dropped during some of the scenes.  Additionally, there are some great battle scenes, including a large, ""Braveheart-esque"" affair and smaller, gladitorial encounters.  Overall, it's the kind of brutality you can really sink your teeth into (ie, it's stunning visually and lighthearted enough that you don't really feel bad about being entertained by it).The plot is a bit silly, and the film drags at points.  Without the awe-inspiring eye candy, this movie would be merely decent.  As is, this is a fine film that foreshadows the kind of film making we can expect with the astronomical increase in special effects quality.",Gladiator
695,Spider-52,I Weep For American Cinema,3,27 March 2001,"Everything there is to be said about this movie has already been said, so I will keep my comments brief.  ""Gladiator""'s musical score is breathtaking; the rest of the movie, in all other facets, is garbage.  If you generally like what the majority of the American population likes, you will enjoy this movie.  If you usually prefer films with competent direction (including action scenes where you might actually *GASP* be able to see the action), intelligent dialogue (it took three people to write this?!), professional acting (brilliant death scene Russell...you really deserved that Oscar), or special effects that seem even remotely realistic, you may wish to look elsewhere.  The latest in a long string of inane Best Picture choices, this is by far the worst in the history of the Academy Awards.The only consolation for myself and those who share my opinion is that in twenty years, ""Gladiator"" will come to rest in the same category as ""Rocky"" and ""Kramer vs Kramer""--not that there were any ""Taxi Driver""s or ""Apocalypse Now""s released in 2000.  If this is a sign of things to come, the future of cinema in the United States will be very grim indeed.",Gladiator
696,Andrew-162,Epic that pays homage.,7,7 May 2000,"The movie ""Gladiator"" filled pretty much up to my expectations. It had wonderful photography and visual effects, probably one of the most enjoyable movies to look at of the 90's. The action sequences are tense, suspenseful, gut-wrenching, slick, and above all, violent. Russel Crowe's talents, unfortunately, are somewhat wasted in this part, since primarily his part is just to fight and be brave. He does do this little well, though.
The plot of this movie is reminiscent of countless other epics.  Emperor has doubts about who to give his throne to, and his unexpected decision stirs up jealousy in those not chosen (Ran). So unchosen decides to run off the one chosen and tries to kill him, though the chosen somehow survives, while the unchosen believes he is dead (though not an epic in practical sense, The Lion King, and possibly others). The chosen finds his wife and son dead and vows vengeance against the now king (Braveheart). He is instead, though, sold into slavery and enrolled in a gladiator school (Spartacus). There, he is put on display in a colosseum to compete with others for the audience's amusement (Ben-Hur). He rallies up support, but after being betrayed by his own people, he is caught by the king (Braveheart again). Then, there is an ending which I'm not quite sure what movie it is from. I must not have seen it yet. Alright, so maybe the movie is going to win any acting or writing oscars. It probably doesn't deserve them anyway. However, the scenes in the colloseum are so beautifully and skillfully crafted, that the academy still should grant ""Gladiator"" oscars for Best Director Ridley Scott, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, and maybe, just maybe, best picture.

His men were very loyal to him, and his right hand man ""Quintas"" was not in the Pretorian Guard,(who protects the Emperor), so for him to turn against Maximus is just not believable, during the Roman empire in the years A.D. it was the army who plotted against the Emperors and in many cases put their Generals as emperors.Be that as it may,its a story of the destiny of men ""when death smiles at you, all you can do is smile back"", as we will all dead, its the when and the how.This is also the third film that had this special type editing, I don't know what to call it, but its like a slow motion, speeded up editing process that's quite unique.This movie has a message here and its all to real",Gladiator

We see the trailer for a film like `Gladiator' and get all pumped up and slap our $8.00 down as soon as we can. But after sitting through 2 ½ hours of a slow, unoriginal story, I could feel nothing but disappointment. Yes, I will admit that there are some cool scenes (the first fight in the Roman Coliseum is by far the best), but that's not enough to make a good movie.  We start with an ok  plot, but one key element is missing  CHARACTER.  None of these characters have any substance to them at all. They are all flat, stereotypical boring characters that have little to nothing of importance to say.  I won't blame the actors, I think all of them have shown what they are capable of with a good script, but with a bad one  not even the most talented of actors can save a film.  So, that is probably the biggest problem here, a poor script that lacks true character development and interesting dialogue. But the direction is also poor.  It was like Ridley was trying to do a little  `Saving Private Ryan' but did not succeed in doing it nearly as well.  To compare it to a similar film - `Braveheart'  we see why `Braveheart' was a much more interesting film, because it had  a great bunch of characters that the audience identified with and cheered on.  `Gladiator' just could not deliver, and boy  was the ending disappointing.  I'm sorry people  if anybody can tell me why this is such a  movie, please do so, but this movie just reinforces for me the idea that Hollywood will always undermine the intelligence of its audience.  `Gladiator' gets a big fat 3 from me.",Gladiator

702,AP-Project,"Great Acting, Profound Story",10,10 June 2002,"This movie truly deserved to win Best Picture. Ridley Scott does a magnificent job directing, and the acting is stellar from the entire cast. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla is particularly enchanting, and really looks the part of Roman nobility.  She embraces her brother the emperor, but schemes against him at the same time.  Joaquin Phoenix is also captivating as the callous and callow, yet fiercely cunning Emperor Commodus.  The late Oliver Reed is wonderful in his part as the former gladiator Proximo, who earned his freedom. Russell Crowe is very good as Maximus. He portrays the strength, pride and dignity of a Roman General very well, and rightly maintains that facade even when he is reduced to gladiator/entertainer/slave status.                                                          The score by Hans Zimmer is appropriately haunting, as this is a heartbreaking film. It hurts to see Maximus lose his family, and become an outcast from the society he loved. It also hurts to see that refined society transformed into a bloodthirsty mob who live for the games orchestrated by a petty tyrant not deserving of the title emperor. Gladiator is very much a tragedy.  I found it amusing that one major critic said he didn't like it because it didn't have enough blue skies and bright colors.  Ok, I guess you didn't get the point of the movie.

The plot was actually non-trivial, Russell Crowe had a wonderful screen presence, and the violent action scenes we well shot and were genuinely exciting.However, don't mistake this movie for Great Cinema. It isn't. This is a Hollywood-spawned crowd-pleaser, a ""Roller coaster of a movie"" that will ""have you on the edge of your seat."" While the plot was non-trivial as I said, it had few surprises and is not particularly interesting, though it did its job of wrapping the action scenes extremely well. The characters also do their jobs; unfortunately, without much flair. I would rate the thinness of the characters as this movie's worst flaw; the bad guy is wholly bad (they even make him a sexual deviant to drive the point home). The good guy is wholly good - plenty of reinforcing the ""loves his family"" angle to show what a wholesome fellow he is. The other slaves are eloquent, good-natured, stoic, and dignified. If you were sold into slavery, beaten, starved and then told to be hacked into little pieces for the amusement of others, would you be so likeable? Me neither. The wise emperor, the faithful servant, and anyone else you care to name, are cardboard cutouts.

709,zordy,It looks like star wars but is much more disappointing.,4,22 May 2000,"Is it likely that emperor Commodus fights in the arena with a gladiator (although wounded) who already proved himself Rambo plus Terminator? Is it likely that one can make a general disappear in the middle of his army without arising the slightest suspect or reaction in an era in which emperors were made by armies? Is it likely Marcus Aurelius standing few yards away from a risky battle like general Lee on a cliff overlooking a Civil War fight? Nobody wants a movie to be absolutely consistent and historically correct, but a shade of inner plausibility is always required not to look ridicule. Besides, all can be forgiven as long as it's entertaining. But all you can save in this mess is a bit of digital architecture which seems dejà vu after Star Wars, and battles (although edited in a dizzy way): the rest is boring, the screenplay childish. Scott is running out of inspiration (like the last De Palma and the late Kubrick), cinema has less and less to be proud of, and I like Ben Hur better.",Gladiator

While waiting for the film to start, I noticed the usual groups of movie hooligans coming in, and I was expecting usual hooting,  laughing, and loud talking that make modern movie-going a torture. From the opening scenes to the final ending, I never have experienced such a silenced crowd as I did last Friday night.The movie was brutal, relentless, tragic, and funny.  The audience were deer caught in the glare of an oncoming freight-train. Two and a half hours later, upon noticing my girlfriend silently wiping tears from her eyes, I realized this is why we go to the movies.  Not to compare and nitpick the movie the way these silly, silly people with no lives tend do, but to immerse one-self into the story and stunning visuals that very few movies in our generation have been able to do. Thank you, Ridley Scott, for giving us a reason to go to the movies again!",Gladiator
711,bleakeye,"A ""Sorry"" to Russell Crowe's ""Insider""",3,15 April 2001,"The only reason that Russell Crowe received the best actor award at the Oscars is for ""Gladiator"" is to make up for not giving him the award for his performance in The Insider the year before.  A charismatic actor, Russell Crowe was the only reason to watch this overrated movie.  I've lost faith in the Academy for their past choices when it comes to their ""Best Picture Award"".  ""American Beauty"" and ""Unforgiven"" were the only winners that truly deserved the award.  Though supposedly historically correct, the story does not offer anything to be impressed about.  Russell Crowe's character ""Maximus"" is unbelievably noble (Spaniard with Australian accent?) throughout this 3 hour movie.  Even his brutal killings (to prove what point?) are designed to be admired.  All the characters are one-dimensional and dialogue is clichèd to the point of being ridiculously fun (not a good thing).*POSSIBLE SPOILER*A general wins a battle, loses everything (position as general and family) and climbs up the ladder of success to face the evil emperor to a predictable end... Death.The story is the least of this movie's problems when compared to the battle scenes.  The camera moves too quickly and misses it's aim most of the time (horrible, even if it was intentional).  This is what you get when you pace the camera for a gunfight instead of a swordfight.  Editing is even worse than the cinematography if you examine it closely enough.  A scene in which a sword is taken by Maximus from an opponent is unbelievably screwed up. After all of that, we are exposed to a rollercoaster ride in which the rails have loose screws.Yet, after all it's flaws, majority of the people like this movie.  Why? Add it's box-office competition when it was first released with a barrage of more horrible movies plus advertising and promotion plus DVD with special features designed to make people admire it even more plus Russell Crowe with Meg Ryan equals ""Movie of the Year"".  It's difficult to disagree with majority but this is very overrated.",Gladiator

714,parsleylion,Epic tale of power struggle in Rome set c.180 AD,8,28 March 2001,"The opening scene of gladiator is a telling moment in the movie. General Maximus is thinking of being home on his farm with his family. This thought is captured in the picture of Maximus running his hand through ears of wheat while standing in a field planted with that crop. The scene cuts to Maximus in a forest in Germania on the eve of a battle, for a moment he sees and contemplates a robin as if with a friend, this is man of interesting qualities. What follows is a bloody battle sequence in which Maximus kills and maims and is nearly killed in turn. Life for Maximus is brutal, cruel and dark and yet we have seen he is not. Who is this character?Enter the Emperor Marcus Aurelius, Richard Harris on a good days work, to congratulate Maximus. Cometh also the emperors son, Commodus and daughter, Drusilla, effectively the royal family, and a retinue of Roman politicians. How does Maximus deal with the political intrigues of a great empire, he fights wars is the answer so he doesn't need to. But now he is placed in a position where he must take sides. He becomes a victim of intrigue and ends up a slave, a gladiator living with the possibility of death, daily.Gladiator is the story of the intrigues of Rome, of Maximus' fight for revenge and how one man can defy an empire. Spectacular in its settings, with the city of Rome and it's Colliseum recreated with computer graphics as a backdrop, Gladiator is big screen cinema. The stunning images of director Ridley Scott capture a gritty and harsh time while displaying the beautiful light and colours this director is renowned for. Incorporating bloody battle scenes set to the equally impressive musical score done by the experienced Hans Zimmer and enchanting music of Lisa Gerrard, this movie is the work of a good team who know how to show the talents of their craft.Coming in at just on two and a half hours in length, Gladiator is the tale of slave versus master, of a spirited man versus a man twisted by power into a hateful tyrant, of worthy leadership against fearful controlling ambition. It is a film of great drama, with spectacular set piece battle scenes interspersed with intelligent dialogue and interesting and plausible characters. It is not necessary to undergo a crash course in Roman history to appreciate the story, which is heavily dramatised and largely fictitious, though the impact of the civilisation of the time needs to be appreciated if the movie is to suitably interest you.",Gladiator

Phenomenal camera work, passionate motions, colourful landscapes, lifelike wounds and a wonderful casting. Hans Zimmer composed amazing music from the beginning to the end of the film. Furthermore, that Enya song, Now We Are Free, is one of the most expressing soundtrack for me in film history. All the fights were perfect and dynamic, and the costumes and helmets...everything just at its potential! Russell Crowe deserved his Oscar, his performance and his victory are such an incomparable ones I have not seen on the screen before. He represents all in his actions that I want to become. Through his moral, he gives an unforgettable memory to me that I am very grateful for, indeed. Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus was a great choice but he still has to wait for his Oscar, though he did an amazing job as well.11 OUT OF 10 or 6* OUT OF 5* is my final judgement.Thank you Russell Crowe, well done!",Gladiator
716,thefinisher_23,R.Scott is the most underrated director EVER,10,11 February 2009,"Some films know not to take themselves too seriously. Gladiator is one of the few films that know it must take itself seriously. It sweeping story, epic action, unflinching villain, determined ensemble, involving story, and larger than life hero make this a classic film by more than one standard. Director Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien, American Gangster, Black Hawk Down, Thelma & Louise) has made many a great film but his ability to let his incredible visual technique tell his stories is by far an aspect that has made him a legend. The narrative itself is not lacking in anyway. In fact it might be the best one Scott has presided over. Maximus's rise from noble general, to broken man, to finally a valiant, defiant, righteous hero is beautiful, triumphant and heart-braking. Russell Crowe can embody any hero and here he take on a true superhero like persona. Senators, queen, and Roman citizens rally around him to bring down a suspicious emperor. To us though Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) is much more than suspicious we see him as disturbed, perhaps perverted, certainly sadistic, evil, murdering, disillusioned son of Marcus Aurelius (whom he murdered when he found that Maximus was to be emperor). The battle scene at the beginning when Maximus's troops rout the Germanic tribes is hauntingly beautiful and glorious. Also worth noting is the solid display of the supporting performances. Connie Nielsen is stellar as Lucilla, a woman who is caught between trying to best her diabolical brother (whom she still loves because he is family) and trying to keep her son safe. The implied past relationship between her and Maximus adds to the stakes of the story. Derek Jacobi is well cast as a seasoned determined senator on the side of Maximus. Djimon Hounson and the later Oliver Reed are likable and identifiable as Maximus's gladiator allies. On the whole Gladiator is unforgettable, involving story whose characters move us. The action is thrilling, the stakes are many, and our hero personifies righteousness and strength. This film won the Academy Award for 2000's Best Picture. I highly doubt it that close of a vote.",Gladiator

No pc soapbox, no one trying to convince you to follow some socialist utopian agenda, just pure, undilluted storytelling!  And, Ridley Scott (screwed at the oscars) delivers with this cinematic masterpiece!Crowe is phenomenal as Maximus, the hero of the story.  Maximus is driven by an insatiable thirst for revenge, yet beneath that burns the love for the dream of Rome, shared by the former emperor (Harris).  But, Joaquin Phoenix (also screwed at the oscars) turned in one of the most disturbing portrayals of evil in moviedom.  Commodus (played by Phoenix) can't be purely hated--look at his upbringing.  But, his actions can ONLY be hated.  And, the threat he poses to his own people cannot be settled through talk or appeasement.  One cannot reason with insanity.  They are, by nature, unequivocable, and Maximus/Commodus portray these elements beautifully.The characters are believable, played perfectly, and the story is impeccably blended with action, drama, and even romance.

Because of this Commodus kills his father, and orders the death of Maximus, and his wife and son. Maximus is not able to save his wife and son, and allows himself to be captured and put into the Gladiator games. The only thing that now keeps Maximus alive is the possibility to win over the crowd, and have a chance to get his revenge on the new Emperor.Gladiator is in my opinion Ridley Scott's masterpiece. With very excellent action scenes, and an absolutely fantastic musical score by Hans Zimmer, it quickly after watching it became one of my favorite movies of all time. Russell Crowe was in every way deserving of the Oscar he won. His performance was beyond fantastic, along with Joaquin Phoenix who was just unbelievable.

719,Angel-Shadow,"Gladiator, proves that love prevails above all",10,10 January 2007,"Gladiator for me is Ridley Scott's finest work. It is credible to state that alien was fantastic but for me this is his greatest achievement in film. Gladiator holds a message within which is never give in, or give up when your cause is worthy, and we can see that Maximus's cause is more worthy than any. Crowe is nothing short of world class in portraying to us the character of Maximus. Yes he is a born fighter and general of Rome, yet he loves his family more than anything and only wants to live peacefully with them. It is because of this that the audience can understand Maximus's drive for redemption, regained respect and vengeance for his family. The battle scenes for me show how Maximus fights with his heart and nothing else, he slays the fighters for his family, he wins the crowd for his family and gains his vengeance. Lisa Gerrard's ""Now we are free"" creates an overwhelmingly emotional end to the film and had me in tears for the first time ever in a film. Gladiator is nothing short of a masterpiece and shows that despite all the endless rubbish that has come out of Hollywood over the past ten years there are still gems and films to remembered for a long time, and Gladiator is certainly one of them.",Gladiator
720,Squeele,A decent B-grade Peplum turns into an overblown blockbuster.,4,16 June 2007,"...and if you think that ""overblown blockbuster"" is a pleonasm, wait until you see this movie. Even if it's not completely shabby, the amount of self-indulgent, ham fisted dialogue coupled with the sheer stupidity of the script makes one wonder...Ridley Scott used to be a visionary. Which doesn't really translate in his poor rendition of the ancient Rome. Colors, framework, costumes: the art direction is very weak. The script is so formulaic and falsely clever it's almost insulting. And the editing rarely shines. The action is either boring or gives serious headaches; only one scene really stands out: Maximus (painfully portrayed by a sleepwalking Russel Crowe) leads his enslaved friends to victory by resorting on their old warrior reflexes. Nothing really shines except that scene; the supporting cast is bland (Connie Nielsen) when not irritating (the usually great Joaquin Phoenix gives a really bad performance as the emperor Commodus).But the most hilariously bad moment is the climactic battle: Ridley Scott and the hack who wrote this should be ashamed. The whole movie tries to re-write history (I'm not even calling that revisionism) introducing modern, Christian philosophical and moral values in the story through Maximus' perception. If we trusted the movie, Rome was a beacon in a world of barbarians. This ends up giving the hero the upper hand in a duel against Commodus, avenging his family with the sacrifice of his life. This whole ending, not only ridiculous on screen, is truly aimed at the blood-thirsty audience who needs his fix of ""eye-for-an-eye"" climax to feel satisfied, like in a good ol' ""Death Wish"" Bronson flick. Not only this is an historical lie (too bad for a movie that tries so hard to feel ""realistic""), but it really misses the mark emotionally as the real demise of the emperor showed true poetic justice, as opposed to the self-righteous, overwrought lines Crowe delivers.As for the ""revisionism"" complaint, I'm asking you: what if, 2000 years from now, a screenwriter comes up with a WWII epic comic book movie (not unlike a peplum of our times) where Captain America (Maximus) single-handedly defeats Hitler (Commodus)? Well, it *may* turn out good. If Ridley Scott isn't directing.",Gladiator
721,Private Ryan-2,"Terrific film, interesting portrait of Roman empire...",9,9 May 2000,"As a history buff, I had a lot of fun with ""Gladiator.""
The actual plot for Gladiator was nothing new. As a matter of fact, it ""borrows"" a lot from ""Macbeth"", ""King Lear"", and ""The Odyssey."" And some of the dialogue was trite... On the other hand, it's probably the most realistic depiction of the middle Roman Empire in film to date. The use of CGI was outstanding, specially the reconstruction of the Colisseum. I enjoyed the minor details a whole lot: the dresses in the Roman empire had more to do with how people actually dressed in the Middle Ages, than the greco-roman ""toga and sandal"" vision that Hollywood created. Also, notice how the nobility wears blue colors: it was the most expensive color for fabrics, since very few things in nature have that pigmentation.
I enjoyed seeing the palaces with actual furniture, (unlike in classic Hollywood), and the nobility using glasses and glass utensils. Romans were incredibly skillful at glassworks. Unfortunately, only a few pieces have lasted until today. It was also quite impressive how the movie starts by showing you why the Roman Empire was so powerful and lasted so long: their technology and war machinery was ages ahead of the rest of the known world. Most of Europe was still living in tribal societies. As we can see in the opening scenes, the tribes of Germania barely entered the bronze age when they got beaten by Roman war machinery. And of course, I appreciated that the main character, Maximus, is not from the Laetium (Rome), but from Spain, one of the provinces of the Roman Empire since about 100BC. Spain, Portugal and Southern France (Hispania, Lusitania, and Galia) were the second most important provinces of Rome.
Spain was kind-of like their ""Cambridge, Mass"": they sent their future Caesars, senators and Emperors to the many Roman universities in Spain (Salamanca, Complutum, Caceres) and military academies. Even Julius Caesar, for instance, was educated in Spain. With its minor flaws, ""Gladiator"" was definitely a great show, highly entertaining as well as educative.",Gladiator

It's a wonderful epic, an intense action/adventure, a touching story of redemption, loss and betrayl, and an all-around rousing entertainment with glorious scenery and atmosphere. Though it's clear that digital computer effects play a part in serving the scenery, it doesn't take away from the enjoyment. In fact, it enhances it. The performances are top notch, particularly from that of Russell Crowe and Joaquin Pheonix, who is deliciously diabolical as the villian.

It has all the stock characters in place: rugged, down-to-earth hero, his slain family, the princess who loves him and the effiminate prince who hates him.  The whole movie was filmed in a murky indistinct way, and half the time you couldn't tell what was going on (except in the oddly lucent ""floating"" flashbacks when everything seemed very computerized and unreal).  There are no high points of emotion in ""Gladiator""; an epic movie needs ecstatic joys and breathtaking lows, but all this movie gives us is grim unpleasantness, which is not fun to watch.

The movie has such great shots, that you will be truly impressed. There wasn't any saving made by the producers with the staging of the scenery. It has been set to resemble perfectly the Roman times. The fighting scenes in the gladiator's arena are shocking, but tastefully done. Actually, the movie begins with a battle between a Roman legion and a German tribe's army. Great shots! It is much better than the fights in Braveheart. The other impressive side of the movie is the consistency of the plot. The movie has a coherent plot which sends us a clear picture of the happenings, without limiting the suspension. You cannot guess the end of the movie at all, and neither the next step, but as it happens it is logic. The last but not least is Crowe's acting. I have never heard about this actor until this movie, but he plays very well. He is manly and sensitive altogether. I commend its casting, when other candidates were more known.

727,Lumbering_Jack,"Action ... and a story, too!",8,9 May 2000,"""Gladiator"" is a good movie without being a great movie. It's not that it had any huge flaws in it, it's just that it never built upon itself. Instead of getting more and more powerful with each battle and each scene of intrigue, the film just resets itself to its previous level. This effort to keep itself in check is what kept the movie from being ""great.""It started with a great battle and, like I said, just cruised along after that. It had no grand climax, just a quiet ending.The story is intriguing -- a tale of treachery, revenge and triumph -- though I'm told it was lifted from ""The Fall of the Roman Empire.""Technically speaking, ""Gladiator"" is intriguing. Here's why:
>>>Unlike Roger Ebert, who criticized it's muddy tones, I thought the use of two major colors -- blue and brown -- was impressive. It helped bring it together thematicly if you think of it. Blue for the sinister politics and brown for the Maximus' battles.>>>Another interesting thing was the use of snakes. Just before some of key gladiatorial battles in the film, they always showed people playing and taunting snakes. Perhaps it was director Ridley Scott's way of saying if you mess with Maximus, you get bit.>>>Particularly pleasing is that Christianity or Judeaism wasn't in the film at all. Why? Because every other film I've seen like this makes a point to show that it was the hero's religion that made them the good guy. In fact, ""Gladiator"" goes out of its way to show Roman/Greek religion as it was truly embraced by the Romans. It was a nice touch.And finally one minor criticism: A recent cliche that has surfaced in movies about ancient times is that the villain is always considered sexually deviant. He's a homosexual. He's in love with his mother. He wants to sleep with his sister. He's a sadist.Why is this? Isn't killing people in cold blood a good enough reason to be a villain? Why do the writers have to continue their ""character development"" into the sex thing?May 9, 2000",Gladiator

The acting was very good, apart from the old Caeser when he died, you could still see him breathing which I thought was a bit amateurish.  It spoiled the effect for me.The main thing that was lacking was the empathy for the characters. Maximus obviously had a bit of a bad time, but you didn't get the sense of his pain that a good movie will provide.  Well written characters either endear themselves to the audience or make the audience hate their guts.  The audience have some emotional response to the heroes or villans, but this film didn't do that.I didn't hate the new Emperor, just as I didn't care when certain events happened to Maximus in the middle and end of the film.The fight scenes were the only redeeming feature of the movie, but they could not save this stunningly mediocre offering.I am disappointed because I thought this would be great, but cut an hour and maybe it would be.",Gladiator

The story is not all that deep,  and while none of the characters except the bad guy are really fleshed out all that deeply (they're pretty much all stock),  you are given enough of the story to make all of the characters' motivations quite believable.  The movie occasionally attempts to make a social or political statement,  but never really delves into the meaning of it very far before the story changes gears.  I was quite impressed by the effects,  though, and enjoyed being given the architecture of Rome in her glory than just seeing lots of things blowing up (some shots of the Colosseum are quite impressive).  When the action is on, it is good with some exciting,  if hectic,  fight scenes.  But this is not an action movie by any stretch, with the fights really being few and far between.  The actors and actresses all turn in very good performances.  Crowe's character wasn't called on to display a wide range of emotion or to show a serious internal struggle,  as his ""job"" is made quite clear from early on.  But he still commands a strong presence onscreen and easily becomes a hero you feel good about rooting for.While not quite what I'd call an epic,  due to its fairly straightforward (though far from dumb) story and lack of a strong message,  I was still highly entertained and left quite satisfied at the end.

Not because the subject matter was prosaic, for that was not the case, but rather, due to the film's longevity and amateurish characterization techniques.Despite the abundance of events taking place throughout the course of the story, by the end of the movie I felt cheated in the sense that the conflict and main characters themselves lacked what one may refer to as ""soul."" The former half of the movie presented an excellent backdrop for the final battle that was to come--but unfortunately, it all quickly collapsed from there as the characters displayed stagnant traits that went on far too long, and were elaborated upon far too little.At one point, it is mentioned in the movie that the crowd is fickle;  it will revere a winner one day, and have forgotten about him the next.  The movie accentuates the fact that by winning the crowd, you can win your way to the top.  Yet I found it difficult to believe that after two fights, Maximus had become the champion of the people.  And I found it even harder to believe that after two fights, the viewer was supposed to regard Maximus in the same light.A quick rule for emotional storytelling:  Allow the viewer to be capable of relating to the character through his actions and feelings.  Dismal demeanor along won't do a thing if the viewer cannot realize that the character is as human as them.",Gladiator
733,natt-2,"So much wrong, so much right",5,16 May 2005,"The photo is excellent. The acting is great. The score is superb.In the end, though, it seems that this movie is more inspired by Fall of the Roman Empire (the Alec Guiness film) than real history. It even seems to take pride in being historically incorrect, making the horrible King Arthur (the Clive Owen film) look like a fully correct historic textbook.Some issues:#1: The emperor Commodus was quite a lunatic character in real life too, but he would never try to face the best gladiator in single combat, even if he got to wound him first. #2: No legions were ever allowed to enter Italy (unless there was civil war) during the era in question. To have a field legion from Germania wintered in Ostia is incredibly stupid and incorrect. If the field legion is in Ostia (which is very close to Rome, being Rome's port), who ever is guarding the germanian border? #3: Even if Maximus could have returned to his legion in Ostia, what difference would it have made? There were 10.000 praetorian guard and 20.000 ""police""-like troops in Rome at any time. I admit that those soldiers were much worse than hardened legionnaires, but how would the legionnaires get through the very impressive walls of Rome? All Commodus would have had to do was to lock the gate. #4: How could Maximus be captured as a slave? That was not the way slave traders got their goods. To make a roman citizen a slave is unheard of. To make a legionnaire a slave is even worse. A deserter? If he was a deserter, he would have been slain, not made a slave. #5: No, the republic would not be reinstated. Not even the senate wanted that at most times, especially in 180 AD when there had been 84 years of very good emperors that the senate loved. Even when there were bad emperors (such as Commodus, Caligula, Caracalla and Nero) who were murdered with the senate's approval, the senates first goal was to get a senate-friendly emperor on the throne, not reinstate the republic. Interestingly, that was exactly what happened when some senators actually had Commodus murdered in AD 193 (yes, thirteen years after the death of Marcus Aurelius). The senate remembered the Roman Revolution, 100 years of crisis in the late republic, saved only by the emergence of the emperor. Only nutcases wanted the republic system back, because it had proved unfit to govern an empire of that size. #6: You should definitely not mention the reinstatement of the republic in front of the next emperor in line. That would have been high treason and, as I said above, a sign of your own stupidity and non-understanding of politics. #7: There were 600 senators. There were no secret police worth the name yet in 180 AD. You could not ""have every senator followed"" #8: People would have been offended if someone threw bread on them in the Colosseum. Bread was free in Rome, available at your local bakery.I realize that a movie is allowed to change history if needed for its plot, but here I do not feel that those changes are needed.I could go on with unhistorical stuff. How could Tigres expect to face the leading gladiator and win if he had been retired for five years? He obviously did not have much time to train. Compare a MMA fighter of today returning after five years retirement facing a champion. That would never work. Tigres never stood a chance.The parallels with Fall of the Roman Empire (which is a better movie) are interesting. If you liked Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius (and he was good!), wait till you see Obi-wan Kenobi do it. I recommend it highly.",Gladiator

This wasn't it.  The story never drew me in, or gave me a reason to care what happened.  I think Russell Crowe is a talented actor, but not in this...

741,Loothor,"Hardly original, but terrific entertainment",9,16 June 2000,"""Gladiator"" is not an original film.  There's tons of comparisons to ""Braveheart"" floating around, but there's dozens of movies that came before, and dozens more will come that have this same basic story.  Sympathetic powerful man is wronged by those around him, loses everything, comes back to attempt vengeance against the forces that destroyed him.  Frankly, there's much better comparisons than ""Braveheart"".  ""High Plains Drifter"", ""Rob Roy"", even films like ""Payback"" just to name a few of many.But this is unimportant.  A film like ""Gladiator"" is not about originality. It's about sweeping vision, high production value, and engrossing entertainment.  And ""Gladiator"" achieves all this extremely well.  You'll hardly believe 2 1/2 hours have gone by when you reach the end of this film. The portrayal of ancient Rome is exciting and believable, the story is predictable yet gratifying, and the directing is interesting without being distracting.  I particularly enjoyed the rapid cutting of fight scenes, which Ridley Scott has managed to make both exciting and excruciating without showing excessive gore, and without highlighting fake swordplay.While I think the cries of ""Oscar!"" only serve to illustrate how haphazardly Oscars are handed out, the performances are very good.  Joaquin Phoenix is particularly effective as the despicable, creepy, yet pitiful Commodus. Russell Crowe is an excellent fit for our grimy hero, and Connie Nielsen lights up the screen with her refined beauty and presence.Ridley Scott has demonstrated his slick professionalism as a director in a way that has not been seen since ""Blade Runner"".  ""Gladiator"" is a big movie, and it deserves to be seen on a big screen.  Go to the theater before it's too late, there hasn't been a movie as deserving of a big screen and big sound since ""Titanic"".I rated this movie 9/10.",Gladiator

Intelligent movies are the ones you watch at home... with the exception of Gladiator.  Sure, some people can say that it's all action and not much else, but compared to the rest of the action epic crop, Gladiator pumps the most brain power out of all of them.  Name another action movie this year that makes you wanna go ""ick"" at Commodus' incestuous advances towards his sister.  Name another action movie this year that almost brings your critical ass to tears when General Maximus comes across the ashen remains of his old life.

745,#1 Gracie,A Great Film...But Not As Good As Awards Make It To Be,8,12 February 2001,"I watched ""Gladiator"" last night to see if it deserved to win over ""Traffic"" at the Golden Globes. And while I still think ""Traffic"" is better, ""Gladiator"" still proved to be a really good film. However, I don't think it was the best film of the year.The story begins in wartime b/w Rome and Germania. Maximus (Russel Crowe) is the general of the Roman army, and he leads them into battle. To sum it up, they kick major Germanian army booty in a really bloody battle (if you are intensely disturbed and grossed out at this point, don't continue watching the film). Anyway, the Emperor of Rome currently is all proud of Maximus, and it turns out he really admires Maximus after his good work all these years, which, of course, sparks intense jealousy from an already ""bad dude"" Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), the current emperor's son. So when Commodus becomes Emperor, he orders Maximus to be killed. But Maximus dodges being killed, returns home to find his family dead, and then while wandering around lost, he's picked up by some salesmen and is held as a slave. He's then sold as a gladiator. The rest of the story chronicles him being a gladiator that sort of teaches Rome with his fighting and rebellious ways to be more powerful than the Emperor...which Commodus isn't too happy about.This was a better movie than I thought it would be. The story was good: it was creative, pretty, touching, and interesting all rolled together.The acting was exceptional. Russel Crowe captured the intensity of Maximus' feelings and displayed them well for the audience to intake. Connie Nielsen was convincing as Commodus' sister. But the best performance in the whole movie was Joaquin Phoenix as the nasty Emperor of Rome, Commodus Caesar. He gave his character an evil that was seen through coyness and nastiness, both blended to give Commodus that bad guy touch that really makes you fear and hate him...and yet he seems so innocent at times. The only other time I've seen a performance like that is when Topher Grace played slimeball Seth Abrams in ""Traffic"".I loved the cinematic artwork in this movie, namely seen during the first battle in the story. The camera dissolves and movement were all used to just make you say, ""Wow!"" throughout the whole movie. I also liked the color usage: blues for outside scenes at the beginning battle, brownish oranges for inside, brightness in the gladiator arena, and darkness surrounding the Emperor. These techniques managed to turn a summer popcorn movie into a piece of art that can be appreciated through many movie goer's eyes.This film is definitely in my top 5 of 2000. While I personally think ""Traffic"" is the best film of the year, I won't ask, ""How much money was under the table?"" if this movie wins the prize.I give it an 8/10, being it was a little overly long. Length wasn't the problem; after all, ""Traffic"" was 147 minutes and I loved every minute. But unlike ""Traffic"", ""Gladiator"" got really boring at times and I found myself looking at my VCR clock a little too constantly.",Gladiator

Still, I can't imagine the acting or dialogue would be much improved by seeing it in the theatre, and watching it at home allowed the viewing audience to guiltlessly engage in an ongoing game of Spot-The-Cliche. That interactivity and Joaquin Phoenix's OTT performance actually kept us more-or-less tuned in for the full two and a half hours, which puts this ahead of quite a few blockbusters and/or Oscar winners in my personal top ten thousand.",Gladiator

The battle sequences in the Colisseum are excellent, but outside of those scenes the film moves too slowly and is too long. I rate it 7. Russell Crowe's character is fighting for an ideal that is never really explained (what - a slightly less oppressive Roman Empire?), and so some of the drama seemed thin to me. Basically, Stanley Kubrick's ""Spartacus"" (1960) does everything ""Gladiator"" wants to do, and does it much better (including the fact that Spartacus is fighting for the more noble cause of ending slavery).",Gladiator

Exiled, yes. Killed maybe. Asked to commit suicide to retain his property, most likely. It is unlikely that he would return to find his family crucified, of all things. Romans were very specific about who got crucified and why. Romans usually avoided it, no matter how cruel the tyrant(?) was.Roman legionnaires would NEVER have a tattoo unless they were barbarians who got one BEFORE joining a legion. Marking or mutilating the human body was expressedly anti- Roman. No statue or depiction exists of a main-period Roman showing a body-marking.

I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears.

It's been a while since release and time hasn't been tough on quality. The battle at the beginning continues one of the best ever crafted. Sometimes people tend to underestimate the value of drama a film occasionally has to receive not to be deemed shallow. This isn't simply about blood- thirst of the Colosseum crowd, it focus on the relationship between a general and it sking, how this king seems to favor the general instead of his own son to be next Caesar of the great empire of Rome.When the son kills his father and takes on the throne the general is cast out and his family brutally murdered. After a series of events he ends up a gladiator and seeks revenge against the king. Sure the scope is taken to a hole new level for stuff like battle between the two, a king and a gladiator.The general expertise in battle grants him a considerable high status upon so many victories as he climbs his way through.

Scott has been responsible for some rather good films, i.e.Blade Runner and Thelma and Louise. He has also done some TV commercials that are dazzling. Gladiator is beautifully filmed, although the special effects are labored and somewhat annoying. It is basically a popcorn epic without a thought. What holds the film together is Russell Crowe's remarkable presence. Together with Ralph Fiennes he may be the most talented screen actor before the public today. The camera loves his face and the soundtrack his voice. Supporting his efforts is a cast of absolute perfection. Connie Nielsen as the quasi- love interest is not a great beauty, but is hypnotically interesting. Joaquin Phoenix as the resident ""mad hatter emperor"" leaves no scenery unchewed in a sort of Freudian twist on the genre. They are backed by a veteran British cast of absolute perfection: Derek Jacobi, Richard Harris, a bloated David Hemmings and the late Oliver Reed. What in the end makes the film come a cropper is dialogue from the screen writers that is utterly laughable. You won't be bored by the film, but I wish Russell would just cash the check, ( I hope it is a large one), and get on with his appropriate business of making first rate films that can make use of his enormous talent.",Gladiator

I didn't HATE Gladiator; the production values were great, the directing good --- I guess it was mostly the story, and (believe it or not) the acting that I take exception to.  In my summary, I called it ""Titanic in a Coliseum"", and I wasn't kidding. I found Titanic to be an okay, but overlong movie.  That's how I found Gladiator.  Actually, it wasn't tremendously long...but about three-quarters of the way through, I found myself glancing at my watch.  I simply didn't empathize with Crowe's character...I found too many thing ways way too under-explained (like his becoming a slave...no spoiler, they tell you that much in the trailers), and I also didn't find many of the supporting characters particularly charming me.  All in all, I'm probably one of only three or four guys in all of North America who didn't love the movie.  But again, let me make it clear...I didn't hate it.  It simply didn't ring my chimes. The plotting was murky at crucial points, the sound track too ""Titanic-y"" (that soft, ethereal music just didn't cut it for me), Russell Crowe simply didn't impress me all that much, and neither did most of the other stars of the show.

771,Nedla24,It Coulda been a Contendah!,7,14 May 2000,"Overhyped!Gladiator is perhaps the most frustrating movie that I have ever seen. Expecting either an action-adventure popcorn movie, or Braveheart 2 I sat down with baited breath.  However, the opening battle scene was completely uninteresting except for the special effects firepower.  Then the movie slinks into a long series of poorly written scenes that serve no thematic purpose (no matter how much they pretend to) but are only there to forward the plot.  I was almost entering REM sleep when the movie shocked me awake with something very strange, a well-written scene.  Once Crowe is sold into slavery, we finally get some movie magic working.  Oliver Reed and Djimon Honsou enter with well written characters and powerful screen presences. Strangeley Crowe's, Phoenix's, and Nielson's characters suddenly become more interesting as does the plot.  The battles begin to have meaning, as does every word.  I exstatically awaited the ending... only to see the writing go back to hell and end in a poorly handled, overly simplitic, and flat out bad ending.  In 3 hours I saw a bad pseudo-epic turn into the next braveheart, only to give way to an ending only found in a bad action movie.  The acting is fine, Crowe is a commanding screen presence and can bring dignity even the most horrible of lines.  Reed's performance is gripping and wonderful, as is honsou in a very small role.  Nielson is dignified and beautiful, Phoenix's characterization oscillates as much as his role does, but he is effectively complex and twisted.  Unfortunately they were all wasted on a Great script wrapped in a horrible beginning and ending.  It's worth a peek, but it should not be an Oscar contender.",Gladiator
772,guardkid,"Entertaining...but not a great ""Roman Epic.""",8,20 May 2000,"Russell Crowe - very good performance. Great fight/battle scenes/tiger shots etc and even the special effects worked well - cool shots of the Colosseum. The film however lacks the quality of other Roman epics such as ""Spartacus."" Apart from Russell Crowe and Richard Harris, the other members of the cast weren't too impressive.(perhaps due to poor dialogue and lack of character development).Contrast this to Spartacus - Kirk Douglas, Jean Simmons, Laurence Olivier, Tony Curtis, Charles Laughton and of course the fantastic Peter Ustinov (best supporting actor Oscar) - what a cast! Yet again like so many other films - music was unnecessarily included in scenes where silence would have been far better. Especially that early scene in the film (*spoiler alert) where Marcus Aurelius tells his son (the irritating Commodus) that he will not become Emperor. What follows is is a way-over-the-top emotionally charged sobbing scene with highly dramatic music involving two characters we hardly know. Its as if Ridley Scott is shouting at us ""You must feel emotion here!"" - ridiculous - the viewer doesn't care about Commodus at this stage of the film! - it made me cringe instead. Btw: What was with all those ""flashbacks""?The choice of music was iffy at times and the ""incest"" overtones - how did that help the film? The character of Commodus was poor - extremely annoying at times (like a brat) and cowardly. Apart from all that it was an entertaining film - it was an epic in terms of duration but not in quality. 7/10.",Gladiator
773,SimianLogic,Absolutely amazing.,9,12 August 2000,"Many of my friends and I (who at our local high school are probably considered the nerdy group--and couldn't care less) anticipated this movie since the first time we heard of it.  One of my friends, who styles himself as a Roman history buff, was sure that the movie would stretch the truth in favor of entertainment value.  Sure he would grumble the whole movie, the rest of us drew straws as to which would have to sit next to him opening night, and it was of course me.  He grumbled all the way there, but once the movie started, he was silent the whole time.  He found stuff he could nitpick after it was over, but while the movie was rolling he was in as much a state of awe as the rest of us.  This is undoubtedly one of the best movies I have ever seen, enough so that I saw it three times in theatre.  I seldom see movies multiple times, exceptions being Jurassic Park(4 times), Independence Day (2 times), and the Matrix (2 times).

The movie maintains its uniqueness among these heroic sagas in the way it affords us a view of those times and men in those times. The panoramic scale the movie maintains to set us up and bring us into the parts of the story is breath-taking. The camera shots of the protagonists makes sure the viewer is held firmly and moved surely  through the plot. The intensity of the final confrontation is brought by sheer force of the way the viewer is brought to this point. For people who enjoy movies, this is an event that must not missed. On a personal note, the opening scenes were a bonus to students of Caesar's Gallic Wars.

I saw a bloated, overlong, tedious, humorless, joyless, tired, boring, ugly-looking, cliched film with terrible digital effects and lead characters with zero personality. Scott has directed two of my favorite movies, ""Alien"" and ""Blade Runner,"" but ""Gladiator"" is a dead zone. Anybody could have directed it. Alan Smithee may as well have done it.Two movies show up ""Gladiator,"" even as it strives to be like both of them. They are ""Braveheart"" and ""Spartacus."" Both Mel Gibson and Kirk Douglas showed more zest for life (and violent death) than Russell Crowe, who appears to be either A) sleep walking or B) angry with Ridley Scott for putting him in the movie. What a boring performance! To see this kind of savage, revenge-driven character done right, there's still no topping Mel Gibson's portrayal of William Wallace. It was over the top, but by golly, you felt the man's passion.""Gladiator"" is a mess. I don't know any other way to describe it. Oscars and money don't always equal quality, apparently.",Gladiator
778,hassan-ilahi,Gladiator: A breathtaking epic from Ridley Scott,9,18 March 2011,"After a jubilant start to his career, I wasn't too impressed with Ridley Scott with his films. They sure were epic pieces, but they usually weren't masterpieces. I wanted to see something visually dazzling and also very good in every other aspect. Gladiator was a perfect example of that...This breathtaking epic was visually sophisticated, well-made, and brilliantly acted. Ridley Scott did an amazing job with the brutal battle scenes, scenery, and characterization. This is truly his best film.The performances are perfect and ravishingly powerful in every way. Russell Crowe simply took the daylights out of me with his outstanding performance as Maximus. The guy was literally born for the role! Joaquin Phoenix is creepy and mesmeric as the evil Commodus, remaining perfect the whole time. The rest of the cast is also great...Overall, Gladiator is probably the best medieval epic you'll ever see. This is mainly because of Ridley Scott's brilliant direction, the outstanding performances, and the Oscar-worthy battle scenes. A must-see that deserved all the Academy Awards it got!",Gladiator
779,p_adkins2004,Not the classic it wishes it was.,6,2 March 2007,"With Oscar weekend just passed I decided to dig out a film that had won loads of Oscars, and nominated for even more. I went for Gladiator, a flick I hadn't seen for at least five years, which five years ago I remember thinking wasn't anything special.And apart from the action sequences, that view still holds. Sure, the coliseum scenes are something special - possibly some of the great action scenes ever shot, but they are let down by a mess of a film, full of bad dialogue, gaping plot holes and bad acting.Russell 'I can only do one expression' Crowe, is perhaps one of the films biggest let downs, he can't decided whether he is a emotionless bad ass, not giving a damn whether he dies or not, or whether he is an emotionally fragile man. I've never been a big fan of Crowe, but especially in the role of Maximus, I feel it is one of the film's hindrances.The dialogue is camp and cartoony, with one of the first lines ""Why can't people just admit when they've been conquered?!"" appearing completely inappropriate for a savage battle scene. Throughout the film the dialogue is one of the recurring problems, which makes itself apparent when it appears self-aware or over-sincere (""You must live or I shall die"").Also, we're meant to believe that Maximus can escape the Roman army and travel undetected from Germania back to Spain, but wait he can't escape from a shoddy little slave ring. Its plot holes like this that mean that Gladiator can't be the classic it badly wants to be.However, it does have quite a few redeeming factors, such as the fact that it is really well directed by Ridley Scott (his choice of panning camera shots and brilliant intimate feel to the battle scenes have to be seen to be believed). And Joaquin Phoenix is spot on as Commodus, never choosing to portray him as a straight bad guy, but the most multi-dimensional character in the film.Oh yeah, and the soundtrack is great too!",Gladiator

It could be the conclusion or the unrealistic idea that a man that far progressed in the roman army and in Roman life to be consider almost a son by the emperor has no real passion for war or political progression and is hamstrung by having the cunning and guile of a rock.

Unfortunately, there is little to either the story line or the acting to understand the ridiculous comments regarding the quality of this movie.  The antagonist is reminiscent of Caligula with over-acting and a twisted personality that defies understanding where his political strength came from.  The protagonist is wooden and compares poorly to all the prior ""heroes"" of this genre. Russell Crowe manages to make Victor Mature look good which is quite an accomplishment.When you start a movie by having the aging caesar far removed from the political center of Rome decide that he will confront his perverted son and announce that the son is getting the shaft and the general is getting the glory, credibility drops like a stone.  No one but Maximus, the son and the daughter know of the plans for succession. Oh, surprise! son kills father. Son kills Maximus' family.

Here, the FX are used to bring ancient Rome to life with astounding quality and scope, great job by Mill Film.

It has a riveting story of revenge, amazing acting performances, and great action.  The action is not as plentiful as in Armageddon, but the scenes do come and they are amazing.  Breathtaking cinematography, and an epic as well as solemn musical score help Ridley Scott's grand vision.  I predict best actor nomination for Russel Crowe, as well as best supporting actor nomination for Joaquin Phoenix.  Go see this movie.  NOW!!!!!",Gladiator
791,636,The digital special effects were a disappointment.,7,5 June 2000,"I went to this movie to see Russell Crowe and the digital special effects. The digital special effects were a disappointment. The biggest being when Russell Crowe went into the Coliseum in Rome for the first time. I was not impressed by the panning around the Coliseum. A good deal of it looked artificial to me. I could plainly pick out the digital stuff. When they were building the Coliseum and there was a shot going over the under construction building it was obviously digitized. In the movie there was a shot from high up towards the ground of the Coliseum and you saw all these small people and they seemed Sim City like. Any scene that had a flock of birds was disturbingly not realistic and poorly digitally created. I am sure that they could have done a much better job. I liked Russell Crowe in this film and just mused to myself what it would have been like if Dr. Wigand could have gone into a telephone booth and come out Gladiatorman and slaughtered all the CEO's of the tobacco companies at the senate hearings. It would have been neat to see right arms flying and heads rolling. The fight scene at the beginning of the film was truncated and did not seem to be as effective as it could have been. Check out Braveheart. The fight scenes in this film are excellent but Russell Crowe does not look like what I envision a Roman to look like. I think of Kirk Douglas. Russell Crowe has the looks of a bloke in an Aussie pub. One of the best performances in the film was given by Oliver Reed. I really feel this is one of his very best. Richard Harris also does fine work as Marcus Aurelius. I did not even recognize David Hemmings of Blow-Up fame. He obviously doesn't have the Dorian Gray portrait thing going on. The Emperor is a puff and I could not help thinking of the Monty Python film The Life of Brian where the Emperor says ""What do they find so amooosing?""

796,Daff-4,"Solid, but nothing special",8,17 June 2000,"Walking into this movie, I was extremely hyped.  Walking out of this movie, I was reading the list of ingredients on the back of the Malteser packet. Enough said.Gladiator is certainly worth seeing - the visuals are impressive, the action is fast-paced, and Russell Crowe is gruff and heroic.  But that's about all. The script is so-so; the plot is basic and predictable; and, most disappointing of all, you really don't get sucked in emotionally.  I mean, all a film like this aims to do is:(a) present a two-dimensional hero;(b) do some nasty things to his relatives; and(c) get you squirming in your seat waiting for the bad guys to get what's coming to them.It was like this in Mad Max ('Road Warrior' for you Americans out there), in was like this in Braveheart, it was like this in Rob Roy, and it was like this in virtually action/drama ever made.  For the film to succeed, an audience should be 'angry' when the relatives get fried, and 'pumped' when the good guy gets revenge.  I was pretty non-plussed on both counts.As for specifics:Russell Crowe is good but not fantastic (and nowhere near as good as his performance in LA Confidential)Oliver Reed's character is overdone and annoying (the only thing he adds to the film is the 'pick which scenes Olly is dead in' game - as he died before filming finished and is computer generated in some parts).The CGI effects are, as always, dreadful.  Although the stadium itself looks ok from the inside, the wider shots of Rome look fake.  Why they PERSIST with these crappy effects I don't know.",Gladiator
797,diffusionx,"Imperfect, but engaging and entertaining",7,24 February 2001,"Gladiator strives to be more then a brainless big-budget action movie, in that sense, it deserves credit. The question is, though, does Gladiator actually manage to do this?In a way, yes. The storyline, while fairly linear and lacking a huge amount of complexity, manages to give proper motivation to each character and it flows smoothly. There never is any doubt what a character is doing in any given scene. The characters are even well-defined, which is more than can be said for the vast majority of its ilk.However, Gladiator does have its problems. There is no joy, and little emotion to this movie. Everyone who is in this movie is either vengeful, depressed, angry, or just plain said. It's a rather cold movie, in that way... compared to its fellow Best Picture nominee Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (which exudes warmth and emotion), Gladiator is extremely cold and joyless. While the storyline does do a good job of saying why everyone acts like this, it still doesnt help the fact that the movie is extremely cold. Im not asking for a tacked-on love story, just a little bit more emotion then anger or depression.Still, that aside, the movie does manage to stay entertaining. Some parts dont seem to flow quite well, but, for the most part, it is good. The many facets of what is going on (for example, Commodus' dealings with the Senate) are well represented, and Ridley Scott manages to do a good job of sticking with these topics and dealing with them.Gladiator has its fair share of special effects, and they are very nice. Fitting in with the theme of the movie, however, much of it is filmed in drab earth tones. The early scenes are extremely blue or red, but never in between. Compared to a movie like ""Titus"" (to be fair, that movie only kinda-sorta takes place in Rome, but I digress), Gladiator is quite dull looking. Still, most of it does fit - the Colosseums look as one would think, as does everything else. But the movie definitely is not vivid, nor beautiful to look at. But it does look nice. A lot of the camerawork is good, but a special point must be made about some battle sequences (both the opening, and some effects used in the gladiator battles). There is just too much herky-jerky effects... enough to distract one from the actual event. In Braveheart or Saving Private Ryan, the camera moved around a lot, to be sure, but at least one still got a good feel for what is going on. With this movie, the cameraman fell so in love with these techniques that he neglected that people would actually want to know whats going on.Still, in spite of these flaws (some more significant then others), Gladiator is a very good movie. It is entertaining (although it does get boring at parts) and it does tell a good tale. However, compared to a movie like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (the two movies do have a lot of similar elements), Gladiator does come out as being the inferior one. But, that doesnt mean it's a bad movie - in fact, its probably worth a spot in a movie fan's collection.",Gladiator

I've seen it twice at the theater, and have every intention of seeing it again before the summer ends.  I'm fervently hoping that Hollywood realizes how successful ""historical fiction"" can be.  ""Braveheart"" is another excellent example.  Russell Crowe does an outstanding job as the stoic Roman General Maximus.  The supporting cast is excellent as well. Gladiator features plenty of action, but unlike so many ""swordplay"" movies, the action does not seem overly unrealistic.  What really seperates Gladiator from so many other similar movies is the fact that one never loses interest in the plot as the action unfolds.  There are no tiresome ""downtime"" sequences, nor does one get a sense that the ending of the movie was rushed in any way.  The movie flows from start to finish, and is a great ride for the entire 3 hours.I'm really hoping to see Crowe cast in similar roles...the hero in a serious/realistic movie.

Reminded me of ""Payback"" (Mel Gibson takes on the mob) minus the humour. This guy was UNSTOPPABLE.. I mean, why didn't he just take on the whole Roman army himself?  Totally unbelievable.The special effects are awesome, the fight scenes are stylistic masterpieces.  I have been to Rome however, I have seen the Coliseum, and I don't think it would ever look quite so ""gold"".  Actually, everything looks ""gold"" in this film, giving the film a somewhat tacky commercial sheen.  I wish he'd done something a little more rough around the edges like Spielberg did in Saving Private Ryan.  The one dimensional story never approaches the emotional impact of Kubrick's ""I am Spartacus"" climax either.Still, I must admit that this would make for a very nice Imax experience.

The story is only fair and the characters flat; and, at over two and a half hours, there was ample time for much better story and character development.  Unlike Braveheart, and The Patriot, two other recent period epics, I was never drawn into the story, never became involved emotionally with the characters, never really cared. And, Crowe seems to play the same character in many of his movies; it's time for less grunting. It was nice to see Richard Harris, I wish he'd do more.If you see it, see it for the scenery and the special effects; they are FANTASTIC.  I remember watching Titanic and being able to pick out the people and scenery that was computer generated. Not so in Gladiator.  Rome looks like it's real, nothing short of amazing.The blood and gore, if you worry about that kind of thing, wasn't as bad as some have said; in fact, there was much less than I expected.Worth the time if you must.

I could single out certain individuals to point the finger at for this artistic failure of a film, but can't seem to see the point in it, this film was bad in so many areas that it really is a collaborative debacle.  Even the general audience failed, because in accepting this film the standards for what will be honored as a great film have been lowered dramatically.  The dialogue was stupid, the characters were completely overdrawn, the performances were typical, the plot was as formulaic as it gets, not one moment in this film left me anticipating the next, not one character was original or intriguing, and the cinematography was unimaginative and monotonous.  On top of this they kill off Richard Harris the best actor in the film at the beginning of this movie which crawls on its belly to the end.  To its credit the film does a decent job of creating the coliseum which unfortunately is not as impressive given the fact that Spartacus the original gladiator film was done four decades before this release and was just as successful if not more in this aspect.  This film never comes close to achieving the success of similar films made long ago. At best Gladiator is a watered down flat derivative of Spartacus.  The film is as dead as the time period it was supposed to depict, and perhaps just as dead is the general public's knowledge of a good film.  As a side note when one asks why it is important to have an appreciation and understanding of history in regards to art or a lexicon in the language of film I can think of no better reason than 'without a perspective of a variety of great works one will never fully be able to appreciate or understand what a great work truly is.'  In short this film lacked everything that constitutes a great film.  What is that?  Great filmmaking.",Gladiator
802,scaevola,Hollywood entertains the masses and makes a LOT of dollars.,3,10 December 2000,"Judging from the box office, entertaining the mob with gore still works as well now as then.  So well that most folks disregard the ludicrous storyline, lame characterization and historical inaccuracies.
I give this movie a 6 for excellent manipulation of the crowd, exciting (if overdone) fight scenes and for making a tremendous spectacle of itself. And I bet it will win an Oscar because it does so well what Hollywood values most - As a previous reviewer states `you could almost smell the blood.'
-SPOILERS-LUDICROUS STORYLINE/LAME CHARACTERIZATION:  Great Roman General takes a *very* sudden fall, somehow becomes a slave, then a depressed gladiator, then hugely entertains the Roman rabble (and us) with his blatant defiance of the Emperor.Oh any Emperor would just sit right down for that, especially one psychologically resembling Caligula.  This particular Emperor doesn't off this insolent guy supposedly because the mob rules Rome and they like him. Well, the mob is notoriously fickle, as well as easily led.  I'm sure any creative Emperor could work something out. (Check out the storyline of this movie if you don't believe me.)  Besides, it's the army that rules Rome. As Pompey so succinctly explained, they have swords.First off, Marcus Aurelius (reputedly a wise and canny philosopher) decides his amoral (read insane) son will just say ""Oh, ok dad.  Guess I won't be Emperor cause you say so.  No problem you like Maximus better.""  NO one could be that naive, even in the movies.Then a great Roman general becomes a slave.  Here's how: He intentionally ticks off the new Emperor, escapes from the Emperor's minions through his eXcellent fighting, then stumbles around wounded and in a daze for a *really* long time, somehow crossing half a continent without shelter, food, water, sleep or a change of scenery, and eventually reaches home (Spain). Or something.  `If you go home wounded you will become a slave?'   Guess he didn't have any friends or neighbors in the area.Then, once Maximus reaches the pinnacle of his gladiator career, some Senators and the army want to support him in a coup.  Wouldn't this coup have been a *lot* more realistic back there on the Germanic battlefield, *before* the slavery bit?  But Maximus missed his chance.  Instead, he childishly gestured defiance to the new de facto, *patricidal* Emperor without even consulting his power brokers, the army, who happened to be on site celebrating a major victory.  Could any great Roman general be this politically inept or have such underdeveloped survival instincts?  Besides, it would have saved him a long walk and a lot of grief.We also have the ruthless slave master Proximo (kudos Oliver Reed, RIP) who sells the goose who layed the golden egg because he develops higher ideals. He just suddenly loses interest in profit because he *likes* this guy?  I have a sneaking suspicion that people who habitually and mercilessly exploit others do not suddenly become kind hearted, even for someone who reminds them of themself at that age.Last and best, a sniveling, cowardly Emperor intentionally stages a final public battle in which he takes on the world's greatest, undefeated gladiator single handedly. (Ok, so the gladiator isn't 100 percent here.) Now it is an historical fact that Commodus fought some tough gladiators in the arena.  Weird but true.  But would *this* character have done so?  I just can't believe it, no matter how much of a tantrum he had because everybody liked Maximus best.HISTORICAL INACCURACIES:   It says this is fiction in the credits. Still...
I don't care how decayed the Roman military system was at the end of the Pax Romana, I imagine they could hold a line in battle better than *that*.As for fighting battles purely for the Glory of  Rome,' even King Arthur wasn't so fatuous.  How about to protect Rome from the barbarian hordes (clearly a continuing threat) and for *financial gain*?And various Senators (to say nothing of Marcus Aurelius!) want to reestablish the Republic?  They hadn't had any real power since Augustus. It was just a ceremonial post that could bring in some bucks if you played your cards right.  And reestablishing the Republic is laughable.  They were all a little too busy trying to stay alive to worry about reactionary revolutions.  Besides the army would never have cut off their own power base voluntarily. And they had the swords.Hey, but lots of shots of Russell Crowe sans shirt though!",Gladiator
803,scaevola,"Common Historical Misconceptions Clarified: (just the facts, ma'am)",3,27 December 2000,"ESSENTIAL TO THE PLOT and you might want to know:Commodus did indeed fight gladiators in the arena.  Sort of a fixation thing.  Needless to say, he arranged to win -- yes, *every* time.  Insane emperors were dicey.  *Stupid* emperors simply did not go the distance.Roman citizens were *never* enslaved within the empire (this includes Spain), no matter what they did.   Never.   They were executed in Rome (for major treason) or banished (for anything less).  Stray slavers did *not* just pick up tired or wounded folks left on the road.  Any Roman citizen would 1) have on a ring of citizenship to proclaim his inviolability or 2) be given every courtesy once declared.  Citizenship was precious and worth many lives -- you did *not* mess with Citizens of Rome.  This was *not* a democracy.  Maximus would *never* have been enslaved on such a ridiculous pretense. Sheesh.Make no mistake:  The ARMY was the *real* power in Rome.  --They had the swords--   *Not* the unarmed populace (this is laughable).  *Not* the solitary emperor.   Proof?   The entire Roman Empire was auctioned to the highest bidder by the Praetorian Guard (the only armed troops within the city) 1 year after Commodus and his shortlived successor were murdered. Beyond the guard, the greatest threat was a successful general with a vast and loyal following in the legions.  And the army outnumbered the Praetorians.  By a LOT.  So just imagine Maximus getting hauled away for execution within sight of his vast, victorious and worshipping army.  WITH Commodus in the camp.  Ridiculous.  'Might' wins every time.  Commodus would never have been so idiotic as to have even approached his camp.  His father, yes.  He did actually attend this battle.  He was secure.  But Commodus? Ridiculous.Roman generals were quite politically sophisticated. This was part of the job as the upper eschelon of Roman power.  NO Roman general would have so annoyed an 'emperor elect' as Maximus did when he refused to shake hands with Commodus.  No Roman general could have been so politically inept.  No Roman general would have expected this rebellious gesture to be ignored. And where are the Preatorians (right here near the emperor!) and where are the army (10 feet away)?  This is not only a tactical, but a strategic event. Think here! It's what generals do best. Give EVERY successful Roman general credit for his survival instincts.  ANYone (even a slave) at this juncture would have done the required thing (shake hands) and then MET HIS ARMY to engineer a coup.  He needed his (vast, victorious, worshiping) army to acquire power.  No Roman general (no human being!) would have been so dense as to make a damning futile gesture when his power base was only 10 feet away celebrating a major victory, just waiting for him to make his move. Sheesh.EXTRANEOUS TO THE PLOT, but you might want to know (the credits clearly state this movie is fiction):You were hoodwinked if you thought that battle scene was realistic. The Roman army was primarily effective because of its supremely structured and disciplined front *line*.  Barbarians fought as a mob and were often defeated even if outnumbered several to one--simply because they could not break that line.  The chaotic beginning battle scene is straight out of the Middle Ages and has *nothing* to do with Rome.  You saw a classic 'free-for-all' (or 'melee') out of the age of knights.  Fun, but not Rome. Romans would have held their line and moved foward as an intact, solid unit, thrusting ecnomically upward with their short swords (never meant for this wasteful barbarian 'swinging' business) as they went.Romans fought only to secure Rome and make some denarii.  Glory was *not* part of the program.  Forget that.  Remember:  Barbarians overran Rome in the end--they never stopped being a threat, esp. the Germans.  AND Romans became *very* venal once conquest began.  GREEDY and SCARED.  That about does it.  Skip that glory bull.  They sure did.Regarding Maximus fighting hand-to-hand in the beginning battle.  Julius Caesar occasionally fought so when his troops needed some fortitude (granted as infantry, not horsed).  We remember this because it was unusual. Perhaps Maximus was unusual also. (?)The Republic was so long and so deeply dead that it is *comedy* to suggest that Maximus (or even Jupiter) could bring it back.  Senators had been merely pawns since Octavian.  It could not have been brought back 200 years earlier, either.  It was also *not* a democracy--not by a long shot.  This is pure Hollywood playing to your emotions.  Slavery was so part of the infra-structure that the revolt of Spartacus (in Julius Caesar's time) ended with 6,000 slaves crucifed every 1,000 feet on the major road out of Rome (the Appian Way).  Not exactly democratic.  Think about it.  You going south for a vacation this summer?  Nice view.Romans did not kneel to pray.  They stood and covered their heads with their toga. And their idols were *not* tiny little figures of their immediate family.  The idea would be shocking to a Roman.Marcus Auraelius named Commodus as his heir when his son was 5.  Commodus reigned for 12 years.  Indeed, he was *not* a nice person.Skip the stirrups.  They arrive much later.Above? just the high points. Read others in this list for more.",Gladiator

Personally I don't give a hoot if the facts are all wrong, if the uniforms and clothing and use of weaponry are historically incorrect. (People who's concerns about this dragon of a film tend that way, I gave those geeks wedgies in High-school) But the representation of the Roman empire as a benign benefactor spreading civilization through out the world is ludicrous, such sentiments belong to the aforementioned wedgie sufferers and elitist euro-republicans.Then there's the script, which is a pathetic attempt at lyrical writing, even Fran Walsh and Peter Jackson could do a better job. Never the less, it was amusing in a so-bad-it's-funny sorta way.And Russel Crowe, let's not forget the torment of watching Russel Crowe act. It's like his brawling: fake and an attempt to hide his 80's new wave rock alter ego; Russ Le Rock. But his constipated stoicism and grunting and mumbling will appear as the classic lone warrior acting to the low-brows who love this film.Oh, Yes and then there's the music. When I heard Rock like rhythms played over roman soldiers marching, I laughed out loud, usually anachronistic film-scoring is the forté of Asian cinema, that can pull this stunt. The music only got worse, from new-age warbling of Lisa Gerrad to pompous choir passages, that even Howard Shore would be ashamed to use.This movie was a non wavering onslaught of boredom and cinematic torture, and I for one was happy when the credits rolled.",Gladiator
808,misteme2003,"A Perfect 10, a fabulous epic, off the charts...**POSS SPOILERS**",10,24 October 2004,"After seeing this movie countless times (I've owned two DVD copies, lost the first, bought another) I've finally gotten around to comment on it. This is one of the best epic movies I've seen to date. You'll see the ""glamour"" of the Roman empire, one mans quest for revenge, and fantastic filmaking at it's best, with an awesome score to accompany it all (Hanz Zimmer). Even the soundtrack is great. When I first sat down to watch this film, I was taken aback by the brutality of the opening sequence, but I hung in there and I am so glad I did. If it was Ridley Scott who cast Russell Crowe in this, he should have won best director...(well he should have won anyway). First, the bloody scenes were fearfully realistic, the costumes elaborate and detailed, and the special effects astounding. The Colosseum crowd CGI created yet unknowing to the naked eye. This movie has all the elements of a great epic, war, battles, love stories, tragedy, ""strength and honor"", integrity, beauty, and it deserved every Oscar it received. Russell Crowe's acting was and remains some of the best I've seen on the screen so far. His response to his loss was heartbreaking, and his quest for vengeance, intense and heart pounding. With his change in status, he never changed his ""character"" and his performance shows it. Russell Crowe deserved that Oscar, and I applaud him. Connie Nielson was an unusual choice, but she got it and deserves honorable mention. This was also one of Richard Harris' greatest choices, he was made for the role of an emperor, we lost a great actor with his death, as we did with Oliver Reed as Proximo, the slave owner and former Gladiator. Another ""newcomer"" Djimon Hounsou as Maximus' friend and fellow slave/gladiator was a wonderful surprise, he was enjoyable to watch and likable...it would be nice to see him again on the silver screen. Joaquin Phoenix was another wise pick for the young emperor, we see what a fine actor he is in this film and his great potential. We know that because we hate him in it...and kudos to him for eliciting that emotion from the viewer. If you watch this film, you'd be hard pressed to find fault with it. It's so spectacular, emotionally charged, and full of talent. I still find myself listening to and loving the song ""Now we are free"" by Enya (played during the final scene in the Colosseum with the sad yet triumphant ending) When asked or discussing movies, I usually mention this one as my all time favorites, as ""new"" as it is. My only regret is that with the ending as it was, there is no room for a sequel (however although a sequel would unlikely be as great, it would have been interesting at least) This is a movie you've got to see, people will be talking about it and viewing it for years to come...don't miss it..10/10!!!",Gladiator

810,AgentDice,I think you've been afraid all your life.,10,3 February 2014,"Although this film has many great actors it was Crowe and Connie Nielsen who give it heart. Crowe's presence fills the auditorium and convinces the audience important events are taking place. Crowe pulls you to his side and you root for him almost from the start of the film.This work is his finest from his appearance as the fierce but reluctant general who was a farmer at heart to his work as the brilliant, unstoppable gladiator warrior to the final scenes when he finally faces the man he has cursed and vowed to kill. He defies an emperor. The Emperor is a yellow-livered, depraved poor excuse for a human being but he is no pushover. He is a determined worm of a man who knows what he wants and how to get it. He is ruthless in attaining his goals, always wrong-headed but unrelenting in his pursuit of satisfying his twisted desires.The movie culminates in a life and death contest between the Crowe and the emperor and at times the outcome seems in doubt.The film was lush and stunning representation of Imperial Rome and the action, both on the battlefield and in the Colosseum, is both beautiful and compelling. This movie contains almost no historical truths but this quickly becomes a matter of who cares? ""Gladiator"" is story telling at its best and whether the naysayers, and there are many, like it or not, ""Gladiator"" is destined be a classic.Connie Nielsen brings a strong and pure feminine energy to the film and her final scene, while is almost melodramatic, will remain firmly established in my mind as one of my favorite movie memories.Could anyone have played the emperor better than Joaquin Phoenix? Possibly but could anyone else have given us greater insight into the twisted soul of the emperor? Could anyone else have allowed us to actually feel compassion for the tortured psyche of the emperor?

811,pg-tsinc,Some numbers just for fun,9,14 February 2016,"The 'reconstitution' of the battle of Carthage between gladiators & legionnaires of Scipion is very uplifting. I watch it as some kind of motivation when facing a challenge where my odds are under average. The last time, just for fun, I've decided to count the 'casualties' on both sides. I know some of you are extremely good with numbers and according to the best I can do: I've count 21 gladiators (it's not easy). 6 chariots will get in, each one having 2 men or women on board. During the sequence, you'll not see more than 3 chariots at a time, and 'during the battle', you'll not see the entire arena neither. Only 4 gladiators are kill by the legionnaires at the beginning. Maximus kills 3 legionnaires. Something a bit weird is the use of women in reconstitution fights. From the 60s to 200 AD, female gladiators appear, as ""exotic markers of exceptionally lavish spectacle"" (Wikipedia). It reminds me a bit about Muammar Gaddafi's use of sexy female's bodyguards: 'Kadafettes'. Listen well, I don't underestimate women in Arenas...It's clear that many women can fight & be bodyguards, but c'mon the use of Pinups (or Drag Queens as security) is an insult. It's a message to the outside world +- like 'You're a bunch of minus, so I only need a few gogo dancers to protect me? Most of these women claim rape after Gaddafi's Nemesis ?",Gladiator

The plot is simple and mythic:  A hero is denied his rightful reward, is cast out of society, and makes his way back to his rightful place.  Russell Crowe's Maximum oozes honor and dignity, even when all he knows is destroyed around him. Joaquin Phoenix's Commodus is his antithesis -- an insecure, scared, and malevolent ruler.  You know good will triumph in the end (it always does in such blockbuster films), but the hows and wherefores are worth watching nonetheless.  Ridley Scott has created a visual masterpiece in his recreation of ancient Rome (the cityscapes reminded me, oddly, of Naboo in the Phantom Menace; surely my imagination was running overtime?).

He then went to  Germany entered an alliance with the Emperor of the Eastern Empire.   He then attacked the Western empire and emperor Gratian and Gratian was killed in battle. Maximus ruled some of the northern and western provinces for a few years and then decided to invade Italy and took over the whole Western Empire for a year or so, then got into a war with the Eastern empire, and lost, and was executed. Marcus Aurelius was an interesting emperor, but he lived 200 years earlier.  His chief general in Germany was Avidius Cassius, who usurped him a couple of years before he died, and the conflict forced him to appoint Commodus as joint emperor several years before he died. Commodus went insane, (possibly due to lead poisoning), and was eventually strangled by a gladiator as part of an assassination plot by his sister and his own cabinet.

I think Russell Crowe did a good job, but nothing about the Maximum role required him to act that hard.

817,tracee,Can't Stop Thinking About It,10,7 May 2000,"For me, there was mostly nothing unlikeable about this movie. The fighting sequences were great. I do not doubt that battle at that time was just as it was depicted. Admittedly, I was into it although I would not applaud as many of my fellow moviegoers did over every death. The story was a really good one, too. The only thing I didn't like was the ending. I thought it was a little ridiculous that Commodus would take Maximus on. But, for where the story had gone up to that point, if I were the writer I could not have seen any other way for the story to end, either. Gladiator, also strengthened one point in my mind. I couldn't help but feel a little sympathy for Commodus, whose father would have taken anyone for a son, but his own. He probably hadn't seen his father much in those 20 years he was off fighting barbarians and all. Not that it's an excuse for his behavior, but it's kind of tragic because that is easily how a lot of people lose their way in the world. Having been denied love and approval from parents and peers, they're easy prey for negative influences, people who shape their unloved, weakened spirits into evil and hatred. Or, in this case, their own idle minds think up evil things. It's really sad. I saw this movie twice this weekend and this idea stayed with me the last time. Movies are only partly make-believe. There's still some truth to each one, some humanity that we all recognize. Anyhow, back to that last fight scene...though I realize this is a movie, I can't believe Commodus went out like that. After the first few times, he should have realized Maximus was not affected by his weak punches. See, he was used to those chroeographed fights he had with his Praetorian buddies in the woods and didn't know how to improvise when caught without his sword. With life at stake you'd think he would've bit the guy's nose or kicked him in the nuts or somethin'. Oh well. I really like this movie on the whole. Each of the performances was great ! I for one, was paying too much attention to the action that I could care less whether or not I could see every person in the upper tier of the audience. Though I usually don't compare movies, I did think the opening music sounded a bit ""Last of the Mohicans.""

We've seen this story dozens of times before, in a dozen different genres, from gladiator movies to football films. The antagonist attempts to, and sometimes does, force out the film's opening hero only to have the hero come back, after a period of rebuilding and soul searching, and defeat the antagonist in the end. James Caan and John Houseman did it much better in ""Rollerball"" The characters were all your standard Roman cliches with the exception of the wonderful final performance by Oliver Reed. This was the film's one saving grace.The film style in the battle and fight scenes was rocky enough to give the most stalwart rollercoaster fan motion sickness, while the more cerebral portions of the film were so deadly dull that these sections could cure even the worst insomniac.

Russell Crowe does impress immediately with his performance as Maximus. He is truly heroic from the start.
The battle against the German barbarians is one of structure against chaos. You can see clearly why the Romans did win so many wars with their formations and attack patterns.After the opening scene the story develops quite well. I know that there have been a lot of negative comments about the story but I disagree. Maximus is a simple man of 'strength and honor' from the start to the end and he fights for his vengeance. There is simply nothing more to it and the script contributes to that theme quite well.Connie Nielsen as Lucilla (Christabella from the Devil's Advocate) plays her role very well. She plays a tough aristocratic lady not to fool around with; her relatives (Marcus Aurelius and Commodus) don't want her as an enemy! When the story develops the true nature of Lucilla reveals as mother and fighter for the right cause but trapped in the web of her brother. Nielsen (well educated, speaks 7 languages fluently) must have prepared herself quite good for the role. Oliver Reed is quite impressive as Proximo, the big boss of the gladiators. While filming Reed died in Malta from a heart attack. Joaquin Phoenix is fair enough as Commodus but not as impressive as the other main actors (including Richard Harris as the old and tired Marcus Aurelius, the old Ceasar).The photography is astonishing and sometimes breathtaking. The creation of the old Rome is quite an achievement. It is amazing what they can do with computers these days. (I read that the scenes of Proximo in the second part where computer generated because of Oliver Reeds death) The few times repeated weat scene works well and gives a peacefull quiteness to the violence and blood shed.It is an excellent movie and I'm sure that we will see more historic dramas in the near future.",Gladiator
821,zza99tmk,Ridley Scott finally delivers the goods again,8,22 May 2000,"I saw ""Gladiator"" three weeks ago, but only now I've got the opportunity to write a comment: the opening battle sequence alone is absolutely impressive and perfectly sets the tone for Maximus' story. Russell Crowe was good but with his powerful Jeffrey Wigand (from Michael Manns modern classic ""The Insider"") still in mind, he didn't impress me as much this time around. Yet, I can't think of another actors to be more suitable for such roles as Russell Crowe and it's clearly to his credit that ""Gladiator"" is such a fine movie. Joaquoin Phoenix is much less convincing, I actually found him pathetic. But that is as well one of the few minor weak points in an otherwise decent script: they should have come up with a tougher, more dangerous emperor - Commodus never convinced me as a serious nemesis for Maximus. Richard Harris, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed (if much of his appearance in the movie had to be computergenerated due to his death during the shoot, then I must say, the result is baffling - it's never obvious, though you might guess where they used CGI) and particularly Derek Jacobi as the senator who strives to dethrone Commodus were so good in their roles that they easily compensated for the shortcomings in the characterization. Visually, ""Gladiator"" is ravishing to look at and the battle sequences are some of the best I've ever seen (dull remake of Braveheart? Bah! Braveheart is self-indulgent and plain idiotic - eat your heart out, Mel Gibson). Admittedly, there were some images in the movie similar to those in Leni Riefenstahls NS propaganda movie ""Triumph of the Will"" but so what? There is no fascist ideology (neither obvious nor hidden) in Ridley Scotts film to worry about. If Scott borrowed images from Riefenstahls propaganda piece then in the intention to establish the sense of epic proportions, to show the power and glory of the Roman Empire, nothing else. ""Gladiator"" has been compared to ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"" - time will tell if it once will be hailed as a classic. I personally like it more than ""Spartacus"" (from which maestro Kubrick distanced himself), but it comes nowhere close to Wylers ""Ben Hur"".

822,cxw1065,A class act!!,7,18 May 2000,"I am usually worried that I'm in for a big let-down when I am looking forward to a film as much as I was to this one.  This time however, I was very pleasantly suprised, when Gladiator not only fulfilled but surpassed my expectations.  It's a brilliant film, which (while containing weaknesses such as a script which wasn't quite as good as it could have been, and one climactic scene which completely changes, and ruins, the ending) manages to engage your heart and mind.The performances are without exception excellent (although the accents may distract a bit, there is such a wide variety of them).  I must single out for commendation Mr. Phoenix, who despite his youth manages to portray a character with such conviction that you never for a moment doubt his interpretation.  His physical performance is as good as his mental one.The film rests firmly on the (extremely attractive and capable) shoulders of one Russell Crowe.  In a tour-de-force performance, he manages to convey a man (not a superhuman) with frailties and doubts and fears and heart.  I cannot convey to you how brilliant this man's performance was.  If anyone else had been this character, the film would have rated at best a five out of ten.Kudos to Russell Crowe, and to Ridley Scott, for managing to keep this film on a level with humanity, rather than one in which the characters become killing machines.A must see, five stars out of five.",Gladiator
823,Cathz,The best movie of 2000!,10,13 January 2001,"I was lucky enough to see Gladiator on the big screen, and I'm glad I did because it was an experience to remember.  I believe this is one of the most brilliantly made films I have ever seen, and I could not point out a single flaw.  The cast was exceptional, not least Russell Crowe, moody and magnificent in the title role.  Joaquin Phoenix was also utterly believable as the twisted Commodus.  I had never heard of Connie Nielsen before, but found she gave a very convincing performance as Lucilla.  British fans will not be disappointed either, for an excellent support headed by Oliver Reed and Derek Jacobi adds even more strength and depth.The story itself is powerful enough, helped along by some truly awesome special effects.  The view of the Colosseum is so real and yet purely digital, the battle scenes are sometimes gruesome but always breathtaking. Finally, a masterful score by Hans Zimmer gives this film its heart-wrenching edge and brings out every emotion in the brutal tale.Anyone who thought this an over-hyped blockbuster in the way of 'Titanic' is utterly mistaken.  It is a masterpiece and historical epic that brings back the true meaning of cinema.  I only hope that the Oscars can do it justice, if for once they get it right.",Gladiator
824,elaurens88,Hated it!,1,20 September 2000,"This movie's popularity is completely inexplicable.  It is basically a pastiche of cliches from every historical epic ever made.  The basic premise - a man's loved one's are killed and then he gets revenge on the sneering villain - is reminiscent of everything from Braveheart to Ben-Hur.  The only bright spots are the performances of Russell Crowe, Derek Jacobi, and the late, lamented Oliver Reed, but the film is so awful, who could care?",Gladiator
825,bringing-sexy-back,Cant believe I never saw it before now!,9,19 February 2007,"Being honest, I was never intended to see Gladiator, thinking it just wasn't my type of film, more of a 'boys action movie'. How wrong was I! Being bored last night, it was on TV so I thought I might as well see what everyone was raving about. As with other epics like it (Braveheart, The Last Samurai), I was on the edge of my seat, eyes glued to the screen.I thought the characters were well written - the complete opposites of the strength and courage of Maximus against Commodus's pathetic coward of an emporer. Some of the lines between them have to be amongst the best ever - the 'father to a murdered son...' and 'smile for me now brother' They bring a tear to my eye (and only braveheart and titanic have also done)Commodus is such a self-indulgent coward, you just have to hate him, and Maximus is a real hero. Their climatic fight is brilliant, I didn't know which way it would go, considering commodus has just stabbed his opponent. The ending was sad, but I felt it was fitting with the film, and I was glad when I seen Commodus about to die, realising he never would win over the crowd.I would recommend this film to everyone, its constantly interesting, has some amazing scenes and dialogue. And most of all, I think I will enjoy it even more on my second viewing. I'm going to buy the DVD very soon!",Gladiator
826,naun,Only a flesh wound,6,24 March 2001,"Gladiator isn't a great film by any means, but it isn't nearly as bad as some reviews would suggest. Sure, it depends mainly on big budget spectacle and production design to achieve its effect, but it's surprising how far big budget spectacle can take you.I disagree with those who say that Russell Crowe was more or less interchangeable with any other Hollywood action star in the main role. I thought his basic persona - the strong yet vulnerable man carrying deep hurts - was quite well used in this film, and his performance and Connie Nielsen's lent a semblance of human interest to a script that didn't give them much to work with. The film's ability to build human drama isn't helped by its failure to provide a credible villain: it's obvious from the beginning that Commodus is no more going to be a match for Maximus than Frank Burns was for Hawkeye and B.J.Some people have also criticized the film for its gratuitous violence, but I'm not sure if I go along with that either. If you are going to make a gladiator movie, you might as well go for broke. As a number of commentators have pointed out, we go to gladiator movies for pretty much the same reason as the Romans went to the Colosseum. To see blood.Having said all that, I don't think the film was particularly well made. The film seems if anything to get less spectacular as it goes along, and what should be a series of climactic sequences at the end come across as hurried and confused. There are also rather too many places where the film is unintentionally comic. There's the film's odd notion that the Roman ruling classes all spoke in upper-class British accents. Then there are what look like odd borrowings from, or maybe misplaced tributes to, other films: the American Beauty-style falling petals, or the slow-motion battle sequences, which looked elegiacal in Kurosawa but seem Pythonesque here. Actually, even Maximus' name struck me as Pythonesque - I kept wondering whether his first name was Naughtius, and whether he had a friend called Biggus. Perhaps Naughtius Maximus would be an apt nickname for Russell Crowe in real life.Once or twice the film does hint at higher ambitions. It touches on the theme of Commodus', Gracchus' and Maximus' relationships with the public, and the potential was there for the film to be a very original type of political thriller - something that would have given point to all those crowd scenes and all those power plays. But that theme isn't developed. In the end, Gladiator is not that kind of film.",Gladiator

Simply put, they kill everyone the main character knows, and that forces him into action that will force him to action that involves killing all the bad guys.  Normal antagonists aren't enough anymore, the bad guys must be literal psychos. It's depressing. This movie handles things a bit differently.  The main character actually remembers his wife and kid throughout the entire movie.  Sorry, no more spoilers.

831,jalvarad,Timeless Modern Classic,8,1 May 2014,"Who said that epic movies were out of vogue in 2000? Whoever had that thought was proved wrong by the modern reincarnation of a stereotypical sword-and-sandal motion picture called Gladiator. Gladiator has all the right elements of a big-screen epic, which certainly made the movie worthy of mass appeal around the world when it was released in the summer of 2000.The storyline is filled with well interwoven subtle eternal themes that make the movie a compelling classic for generations to come. Even though some may perceive some of the scenes as grotesque and barbaric, the movie presents a well-balanced view of life in Roman times. It is certainly entertaining, artistic and thoughtful in its own way.With an outstanding cast of actors, Gladiator has shown to the world that great movies can still be made when enough attention is given to every single detail of production. Certainly the movie was a success because of its script and seasoned and measured acting performances. It was also Oliver Reed's farewell performance, which fully encompassed his abilities as an actor. Perhaps it was pure fate that the casting director and production team chose him for the role. Nevertheless, it is hard to imagine someone else playing his role.This is certainly a movie that must be seen on the big screen uninterruptedly. And once you have seen it, please grab a history book and learn few more things about the ancestral heritage of the Roman empire.",Gladiator
832,ilovelctr,"Not bad story, some solid acting, crafted with extremely well choreographed martial-arts action sequences",8,6 September 2010,"Back when this movie was born, I didn't get the chance to watch it. I'm glad I did today, of course, the 10th anniversary remastered version.In general, it's a typical action-oriented Hollywood blockbuster, where there's not much plot involved. But this film successfully keeps its pace at a mid rate that doesn't make audience fall asleep, which is good for its genre. Compared to action thrillers like Bourne films, it lacks twists, while compared to formulaic ones like Kill Bill and 300, it still offers you a lot to see; not to mention that it's got a good ending.As for the acting, not THAT much can be pointed out as outstanding since for a historical epic like this, it's mainly about men's bravery and the like. But, Russell Crowe's portrayal as Maximus is beyond awesome! He really brought the character into life as well as some depth. And of course, he's looking handsome as always (said by me, a boy who's not gay :D, LOL). Other characters do well enough to keep the film go on, but perhaps it's due to the simplicity of the parts for them that they do just good but not great on the whole.On the other hand, directing, coloring (post-production), score and staging are all very well done. The colorful cinematography reaches state of art. Everything, ranging from constructions, sceneries, costumes to decorations of rooms, is beautifully colorful. Action sequences are where the film truly stands out. Apart from being well choreographed, there're also many little innovations to them that are very original.The major flaw is certain useless subplots that slow the already-not- fast pace down, especially in the 1st act. But that doesn't hurt much, as the later scenes' intensity makes up for it.8.5/10",Gladiator

834,mrforgetful,Gladiator rocks my socks,10,31 July 2005,"For fear of somehow being misunderstood, I wanted to make something quite clear before I get started: this movie is awesome.Yes this movie has spectacular special effects, yes this movie has amazing battle sequences, and yes this movie has a riveting soundtrack. But that's only the beginning of how incredible this movie is. The problem is that most historical epics would be happy to stop at that and be like ""oh, well at least he's wearing sandals and we have cool fight scenes."" Nuh uh not here.Gladiator features an amazing cast. Joaquin Phoenix is incredible as Commodus, and makes a fairly obscure historical figure very 3 dimensional: Commodus is one of the greatest baddies in recent memory. Richard Harris is outstanding as Marcus Aurelius, and everybody else does a great job as well. Last but not least, is Russell Crowe. This guy can act. And what is amazing is that he's awesome in this movie but he's even better in other movies. He's not just a one note guy. He's such a good actor that he can say scarcely anything for about 20 minutes in a movie and still get people to understand what he's doing/thinking (as there is a point in this movie which is similar).The script is also excellent. As far as sword and sandals epics go, most are content with articulate set pieces and large scale battle scenes (huzzah!) but lack sorely in a decent screenplay soaked with character development (hissss...) Gladiator is not this way. Instead of merely trying to work around battle scenes and try to uncover a plot, it works the other way around, and the battle sequences must work around the story line. So not only is Gladiator an able action flick, but it is also an ancient political thriller.Now that I've got that out of the way, let me go back to the battle scenes, because they are just amazing. A combined effort of superb editing, heart-pounding musical cues, and great cinematography create several amazing sequences. Especially the scenes in the Colossium. I still sit there and think ""holy crap, how did they do that?"" Any movie lover should watch Gladiator. There is a reason it won 5 academy awards. It's not just a testosterone-pumped action flick, but a quite intelligent story and does not insult your mind.",Gladiator

It's the same ""You betrayed me and sent me into exile, but I'm back and ready to kill you,"" story, but in this version I didn't care about any of the characters. Maybe it's because I don't find Russell Crowe's acting style compelling or maybe the characters are genuinely underwritten, but I just didn't care about what happened. My advice is to just watch Ben Hur instead. At least you get a cool chariot race there.",Gladiator
836,viggodahlin,Joaquin Phoenix is one of the greatest actors of our time.,8,9 August 2021,"There is no denying it. Phoenix in all of his movies he delivers. He commits perfectly to the role he plays and in playing the character Commudus he truly shows, that it doesn't matter if he's the villain or the hero.The story in this film is quite dark if you think about it. The greatest general of Rome, Maximus continues to obliterate the enemy in his scope with extreme audacity. Although, later on we are introduced to his displeasure battling in the war and his longing to his family at home. The Caesar tells Maximus that he wants him to take over as the new Caesar after he dies. Maximus does not want the throne and so on he refuses to accept the honorful request from the Caesar.As soon as Caesar tells Commudus that instead of him, the true Caesar, Caesar wants Maximus to take the throne, it all goes to hell. Maximus gets the worst punishment possible (his family gets burned alive and he has to submit to being a slave). And after all this he still manages to rise in the ranks and ultimately overthrow the throne from winning the crowd and killing Commodus.But it wasn't this simple of a story for me, at least for the character Commodus. Commodus, he's envious, greedy, sad and a very lonely soul. From the very start we see how his own father completely and utterly humiliate him in front of the whole soldier army, and indirectly chooses the general as a ""better"" son. But he keeps his head up, he knows that he will still be the next ruler of Rome and to marry his own sister. But this plan becomes a lot more difficult when his father comes to him to say that he will pick the general as the next Caesar and not him, and that ""Your mistakes as a son, is only my mistakes as a father."" Hearing all this, he puts up a beautiful speech and then hugs his father to at last say, goodbye...Commodus kills his father and then later on picks himself to be the next Caesar as it wasn't official of his father's choice. Maximus's family dies and he gets hunted to be killed so no complications can arise. Everything works out as he wanted but nothing is what he dreamed of. The crowd of the colosseum and entire Rom boos him and want him gone. The senate isn't either to pleased about his arrival but of course one narcissistic guy enjoys his upcoming. Commodus is quickly tired of the senate and want him and his sister only to exist in this purified world. He caresses her often and eventually tries to kiss her but she in no way feels the same, she is terrified of him and hates him.Commodus doesn't care and forces her to be with him or he will kill her son. Later we see him watching the gladiator games and a particular someone getting extra attention. He goes down to see who it is and yes, it's Maximus. He tells Maximus to drop his weapon if i recall correctly, and after a short solid pause Maximus doesn't follow his orders, the CAESAR's orders. The crowd loves it and Commodus obviously can't kill Maximus in front of the crowd, then it would be impossible to get the crowd back. A little input from myself is that, this is where Commodus realizes that it truly does not matter which position he is in or Maximus for that matter, it all stays the same.After a few events unravel, Commodus faces Maximus in a 1v1 sword fight. Both lose their sword after a while but Commodus has a knife up his sleeve and tries to stab Maximus but the reverse happens and Commodus tries punching Maximus several times in his arms with nothing happening. Maximus ends it and Rome is saved.A very fine storytelling indeed. The reason as to why i focused much more on Commodus is because he is certainly more sympathetic and interesting. He truly never understood love or life in that matter. His goals were always deceitful, malevolent and greedy. He never received even an ounce of love in his entire life and all he ever wanted was for his father and for his sister to love him. He never deeply wanted anything more than that. It's heartbreaking and the acting that Phoenix applies to this intricate and lonely soul is absolutely astounding and just beautiful. My words can't merely express enough how great of an act Phoenix puts on.8.5/10.",Gladiator

It has craters in the story the size of the Colisseum, but Russell Crowe makes it all work.  He is totally believable as a hero, as a gladiator, as anything.  He is a rare combination of star power and awesome acting skills, and he grounds and dignifies this movie even when it gets manipulative, cheesy and vulgar. Also, the writing was surprisingly mature.  I loved the way the Colisseum looked, I loved seeing Oliver Reed again, and Richard Harris. Joaquin Phoenix was fantastic too.  The music sucked big time.  If Gustav Holst was alive he would sue the composers for stealing unashamedly from his symphonic poem, ""The Planets"".

Yeah a slave gladiator takes over the greatest empire on earth by Killing Caesar in a duel front of spectators. How likely is that? The film tries its best to try to convince that it is plausible, but that's what makes this film hilariously bad.The fighting scenes were poorly choreographed. The Tigers lounges out, it seems, only when the director wants them to, not when the gladiator should be trounced by it.The special effects in this movie were not special.

There were a few ""big"" moments like the opening battle scene but everything just peters out towards the ending. Even the gladiator fight scenes, though well cheoreographed, were not exactly epic in scale.   The only other visual feast was when Comedius returned to Rome as the succeeding emperor but that was in the first third of the film!  Russell Crowe does a fine job but the most interesting role belongs to Connie Nielsen.  She seemed morally ambiguous and her claims of fearing her brother and being coerced into certain actions were only half-believable. She could be more opportunistic and manipulative than cowered and a victim of circumstance.  This role could be explored deeper but I'm glad there was such a character to cast some doubt and shadow in an otherwise black or white morality storyline.Watch the show for it is a fine piece of work but NOT one of the best film that one will ever see.",Gladiator
841,repulsion,Ridley Scott's lame take on a WWF bout,1,17 December 2000,"The denizens of the Roman Empire were a particularly bloodthirsty lot, and apparently not that far off in mentality from our own culture. The vox populi, bored to the heavens with the multitudinous burdens inflicted on them by their government, seek escape in the mind-numbingly bland entertainment provided within the Colosseum. Gladiators fend for their lives against a series of uniquely dressed foes and beasts, all in the hope of winning their freedom. Everything about this testosterone-toned epic is meant to cater to a population who likes their filmed landscapes served to them WWF-style.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is a top army general in the army of Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris), a dying patriarch who (in predictable fashion) unwittingly causes trouble within the family ranks by offering his throne to Maximus instead of to his son Commodus (Joaquin Pheonix). Auerlius' son is the kind of whinny, pussy-whipped boy that your audience likes to hate because the character's moral fiber makes the character so easily expendable. Commodus' temper tantrums lead to patricide and the film turns into an interminably messy three-hour affair simply centering on the standard theme of revenge.Maximus is sent to die in the woods but manages to get the upper hand and kill Commodus' henchmen. He returns to his homestead only to find his wife and son lynched from trees. Poor Maximus is denied the throne of Rome and is now being fueled to wage a one-man war against the sissy who wiped away his entire family. As Maximus works his way back to Rome, unbeknownst to the new king Commodus, our foppish king swishes around the kingdom ridiculously hitting on his sister Lucilla (Connie Nielson) and hovering inappropriately over his nephew Lucius (Spencer Treat Clark).In the first hour Ridley Scott has expertly painted his archetypal figures, forcing us to love the brave Maximus, wifeless and sonless, and hate the creepy teenager with the thirst for forbidden fruit. Maximus, once back in Rome, manages to enter a gladiator troop manned by one Proximo, the late Oliver Reed. This little group of circus freaks will provide Maximus with the proper cover through which he can maneuver himself into the hearts of Rome's people. Not only is the man driven by revenge but he is also cocky enough to believe that he has what it takes to accomplish the sort of feats no other gladiator has been able to accomplish. By his side is Juba (Djimon Hounsou), the proverbial Black voice of wisdom. If not for Will Smith's more unfortunately stereotypical role in Legend of Bagger Vance, this would have been the kind of role that would have garnered the deserved scorn of people like Spike Lee.For two hours, Scott inundates us with endless arena fireworks that would serve the acrobatics of the Rock and Hulk Hogan to a much better effect. The characterization of Crowe's character amounts to nothing more than a cocksure man, full of false bravado, whose only apparent skill is to raise his arm into the air and scream for his men to surge into battle. He is the kind of screen character who wages war against hundreds of foes within the course of a movie and manages to dispose of all of them with relative ease. He is also the kind of superhero archetype that garners the admiration of young boys like Lucius, something which causes our dear Commodus to go even further over the edge.Scott is to be admired in the end for at least not being a hypocrite, as he practices what he preaches. Since the citizens of Rome seem only to live for bloodlust, Scott manages to paint Gladiator as nothing else than that: entertainment geared for audiences whose sole interest is seeing men and tigers beat the s**t out of each other for three hours. But if this is all there was to the film then one would see little complaints from my person but Scott makes the mistake of filling his film with arty flourishes.The film opens with Maximus walking across a field, his hands slowly caressing tall blades of grass. These flashbacks, along with various cutaways to fast-moving skyscapes, amount to nothing more than pretentious attempts to add artistic credibility to an otherwise sophomoric film. Its as if he is aware of the fact that his film is devoid of any three-dimensional resonance that he tries to quickly interject soft touches of humanity into the proceedings. The end result is nothing less than visual illiteracy, ringing completely false and cowardly.When it comes to epics none come better than Tarkovsky's Andrei Rublev or Eisenstein's Alexander Nevsky, two masterworks from Russia's greatest directors that fully captured the three-dimensional scope of war. The bad guys in these films, unlike the one played by Phoenix in Gladiator, are the kinds of foes whose selfishly malicious journeys are never cartoonishly drawn. The landscapes created by the Russian masters were poetic and grand, full of visual and emotional urgency. Scott's film is amounts to nothing more than being beat over the head by a club for three hours.",Gladiator

However I was somewhat disappointed by the extreme use of computer graphics. I deliberately haven't read any comments from other viewers or any other reviews so I could write unfettered.  The emperor, the son of Marcus Aurelius, was the best actor along with his father. The fight scenes were excellent but they were mostly camera motion and sound effects. How one man could survive hand to hand combat with a never ending no. of physically fit combatants was hard for me to believe.  And lastly,  I missed out on hearing a large number of words.

846,keithanddeenie,almost the top of its genre,8,2 July 2000,"The battle scene in Gladiator presents the dichotomy of the human butchery below and the serenity of the sky above.  That image becomes the theme of the film itself.  Like all worthy films, Gladiator is a love story.  Love being a complex emotion with two faces, it is the character of the cruel and cowardly emperor Commodus that truly stitches this movie together.  As Commodus, I found that Joaquin Phoenix gave a performance comparable (if not exceeding) that of no greater a portrayer of cinematic villainy than Christopher Plummer.  Plummer, the most noted Iago, Shakespeare's ultimate bad guy, of the 20th Century, also assayed the part of Commodus in The Fall of the Roman Empire (1964).  In that, lesser, film Plummer's Commodus provides the common foe that enables the love connection between Sophia Loren and Steven Boyd to shine.  In Gladiator, Phoenix's brooding depiction of a man balanced on the edge of insanity lends his victim the pedestal of greatness, and in turn propels Gladiator above other Ancient Roman era epics, with the exception of Ben-Hur.  It is love that sends Commodus over the edge, not love of a woman, but love of himself, when he finds that he can't truly kill his father, the emperor Marcus Aurelius, whose spirit carries on in the person of the betrayed general and eventual gladiator Maximus (Russell Crowe).  The battle scene and the scenes of gladiatorial combat are not cheap gore.  They underscore the inherent brutality of that place and that time in history.  There is blood, but just enough to make the point intended.  Another theme in Ancient Roman costume epics has been the birth and fruition of Christianity, most notably in Ben-Hur and The Robe. This is touched into the canvas of Gladiator with a fine brush, as if Seurat had painted the scene, but it never comes forefront, almost thankfully. Like the sky above the battle scene, it is simply there, in the love of Maximus for his absent wife and son.  There are some noted actors who contribute to Gladiator:  Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius; the late Oliver Reed; and Derek Jacobi (who has had plenty of experience in a toga as the star of the I, Claudius series).  Gladiator is a worthwhile and uplifting film, well-acted and well-directed.  It does not succeed to the top of its genre, but very nearly so.",Gladiator
847,nashcalefarms,"i think i liked it even more than braveheart, which is hard to say",9,23 June 2000,"ok, in order to talk about this movie of course one gets embroiled in talking about braveheart. i really liked braveheart. it was the 1st good epic in a while. i own it. really, i liked it. however, here are some reasons i have, after much deliberation, decided gladiator is a better movie. there will be some SPOILERS probably. 1. mel gibson is a good actor. i liked him in braveheart and even more in lethal weapon. he has a unique ironical twist to his acting. but i think russell crowe is overall a superior performer. he is quickly becoming a favorite of mine, from what i've seen him in: l.a. confidential (awesome!!), the insider (didn't really like it but he was great), and now this(also some movie the name of which i don't know but i think bridget fonda was in it and it was about magicians). 2. better story. braveheart was very simplistic, which worked, but i thought there was a more substantial plot here. roman politics i personally find very interesting. 3. i could care less that it's historically inaccurate. anyone who thinks braveheart was accurate needs to brush up on some history. geez, robert the bruce was way more historically significant than wallace. 4. i thought the action was better. braveheart had great battle scenes but i thought gladiator's action scenes were more inventive and original. 5. phoenix was real good. some people will say he was too whiny but i thought that was what made it good. i don't know a lot of pathological villains but my gut tells me real bad guys probably have at their core real insecurity issues. a word about the 1st scene - SPOILER!! - i thought the shift to blurriness at the end was great, it was melodic and if they had just had just continued the fight as was there definitely would be even more braveheart comparisons. now, just to be objective, a few problems: 1. the ending. the whole thing with people crowding around him and someone saying ""who will help me carry him?"" was cheesy and out of place. 2. that part at the beginning where he's riding home threw me for a loop. i don't mind time elapsing quickly but it seemed disjointed. i mean, he rode really far, like across the whole freaking roman empire!! anyways, overall it was awesome. i genuinely think that if both braveheart and gladiator came out at the same time more people would like this, but it's hard to say a new movie is better than one you already love.",Gladiator

Honestly, I must have seen this movie a solid 7 times, twice in theaters.  Every time I go into it trying to find what all the buzz is about.  I still don't see it.  Mind you, Crowe was great, most of the battle scenes where definitely on point, but why is it so good.  What am i supposed to take out of this movie?If you ask me it's overrated, but it could have been much better.  The plot lacked as the movie progressed and the final battle was anti-climatic.  No one can honestly tell me going into the final battle that they could not predict the outcome.  It was by far Maximus's weakest opponent.A pretty good movie, but if you ask me, I'd rather see Braveheart ten times before i watched that movie again.",Gladiator
849,movieandtvfanatic,Overrated....simply put.,5,14 March 2010,"Some movies manage to split the public and critics' opinions right down the middle but still manage to do well at the box office and get tons of awards notice and high ratings. ""Gladiator"" is one of the biggest examples of this, and I am in the camp that finds this to be a weak film.2000 was fairly weak year for movies, but this isn't an excuse for ""Gladiator"" winning the Best Picture Oscar. You still had great films that were completely snubbed like ""Almost Famous"" (my choice), Billy Elliot, Cast Away, Wonder Boys, and among the nominees, Traffic. These films represented the few glimmering moments of film in 2000.Gladiator has actually grown on me with repeated viewings but it is still by no means a great or even good movie. I feel that Russell Crowe did not deserve the Oscar over his entire category and while I am not a huge fan of him as an actor or from what his persona perceives, he did give good performances in ""L.A. Confidential"", ""Romper Stomper"", ""The Insider"", and ""Cinderella Man"" and these went relatively unnoticed (save for ""The Insider"").

This film has drama, an easy to follow story, incredible performances, fantastic writing, and unmatched set design. In all honesty, I loved the performances and story so much in this film that the action might have been my least favorite part of it. Between Russel Crowe's simple but powerful performance to Joaquin Phoenix's literally unbeaten performance as an unstable psychopath filled with rage, there was always something interesting and nail biting going on.

It gave us a glimpse into the inner workings of the royal family's drama and politics, too.So much to see, think about, and enjoy! A feast for the eyes of those of us who enjoy a vicious battle.

To be quite frank, Russell Crowe's performance bored me to tears. I couldn't believe in his portrayal of Maximus, there just seemed to be something lacking. The only scene in the film that he actually made me believe was when he was speaking to Marcus about his home and how he didn't want to be emperor. There I was convinced after that... nothing. Joaquin on the other hand did a phenomenal job. He was ruthless and i literally couldn't wait to see what he would do next. To me he was amazing as Commodus. The fight sequences were a little drawn out but I feel that way about most fights in movies and they weren't bad but just a smidgen over done. The scenery was awesome and the sets had a great WOW factor to them but thats all that was really good about this movie. The ending ticked me off the most. I hate movies were from the beginning you know the main character is going to die. I mean why even bother with it? They should've at least had one of them live, maybe it would've made it better I don't know.

Its about a pathetically boring music score and the use of huge suffocating close ups for emotional intensity. Its about blurry computer generated reconstructions and a cloddish leading performance.

859,eldakim,The true definition of being a man,10,7 June 2006,"This is by far one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It actually inspired me to be something greater. I felt the need to achieve and become what truly defines a man. Maximus is seriously one of my favorite characters in movie history because he's fascinating and interesting to know about. He is also, once again, what stands as a true definition of a man. A man has to be responsible and patient, and this man just does that. If I have to pick a single most influential person besides Jesus, I'd still go with Maximus. What he did in the movie was truly outstanding and I wish that he was an actual person in history. The death of his family gave him a small moment of despair, but he took it all in, including the loss of his rank and his status now as a ""slave."" As Maximus gradually progresses as a gladiator in the movie, he just becomes more and more bad ass, being the true hero of the entire movie. He never flinches in pain, but stands up, all the way to the end. The faithfulness he builds in his two friends is awe-inspiring, and their willing to take consequences for his survival is what represents strong friendship. Maximus is by heart THE man. Gladiator is one of the most inspirational movies I saw, and there are no others like it.The movie itself was purely genius. Although it's a pretty simple story about revenge, it has interesting side stories and build ups of characters. The performance as Maximus by Crowe was electrifying. He pounds in every good quotes in the movie in the most awesome ways. Phoenix as Commodus was also notable. I truly hated this character because I saw him as a coward and the true villain of movies. He is just so evil and so cold, even his expressions and appearances define that. Phoenix was just so great as this character, and no others would have been able to land such a villainous role. Other notable characters were Djimon Honsou as the gladiator friend as well as the many others that Crowe's Maximus encountered. Connie Nielsen was also great as Lucilla, who was interesting in that she didn't have a like mind as Commodus. I felt the passion she had for Maximus and the statement she makes about Maximus in the end. I think Oliver Reed as Proximo was a great character that I can easily compare as the teacher. He brought up Maximus's true strength and trained him to become a defined warrior. At first impression, he seemed like a cold blooded man, but the last scene of him with Maximus proved of how caring he is for Maximus and for his sake. Overall, the actors and actresses did an outstanding job playing their parts.The score and the effects were just beautiful. The battle songs were just so inspirational and I found myself listening to it for a boost of strength. The special effects and movie quality was so rich and brilliant, with some of the best actions available.Overall, I think Ridley Scott did a great job in making this film. This movie will simply be placed in my list of best movies in all time.",Gladiator

865,markles,The best movie in years...FOR ME TO POOP ON,1,11 May 2000,"Let me preface this by saying I'm a fan of most of Ridley Scott's work. Bladerunner is a terrific flick and Alien ain't too shabby, either.  Then I saw the trailers for Gladiator and some early reviews(almost exclusively raves) and got excited for a good, well-made film.  What I got was the most boring movie I've seen in a theater in quite some time.  Initially, I gave the film the benefit of the doubt...a lot of people liked this so it must get interesting sooner or later.  About 45 minutes into the film, however, I realized it wasn't going to get any better.  I first looked at my watch at that point and proceeded to do so at least every ten minutes thereafter.  I hoped the reel would catch fire and save me from watching the last hour but, alas, I had to watch until the end.  I probably would've left but I attended the film with my father and we hadn't been to a movie together since T2...what're ya gonna do?.Gladiator was lifeless and unoriginal.  The plot was shabby and often laughable, and I honestly believe the folks at MST3K could've had a pretty good time with it.  Much of the dialogue was cheesy, the camera work was largely uninspired and every time a computer generated 'roman' backdrop was on screen the characters amidst them were fuzzy and shadowy.  At other times Scott included footage to purposely sicken the audience, i.e. the ""snot"" scene.  Did anyone else find that as nasty as I?Another problem with this film as that, despite its epic running time, the plot progression is hasty and incomplete.  Maximus goes from general to slave in about 3 scenes(why is he a slave again?) and kills around 7 people as a gladiator before becoming the most popular man in Rome.  There's plenty of room for good development within two and a half hours.  Instead, Scott pushes Gladiator's sub-par progression only within the brief action scenes(the only interesting scenes in the entire movie...honestly) and offsets them with minutes upon minutes(hours?) of crap that doesn't go anywhere.  The raves this movie has received confuse me.    Gladiator is the most overrated movie in years.If you're looking for a good movie along the same lines, watch Conan the Barbarian.  Gladiator uses roughly the same story line, but Conan is about 3000 times more entertaining.  And don't get popcorn before you enter the theater.  Believe me, you'll welcome any excuse to get up and stretch your legs before the movie actually concludes.",Gladiator
866,shosee,"As his character commands legions, does Russel Crowe command his audience",7,26 June 2000,"In a spectacular historical drama such as Gladiator, the acting must be on the same scale or the whole thing becomes comical.  Russel Crowe brings brings a style that portrayed a character of heroic proportions while at the same time making him accessible to the average person.  Crowe has a approach to this role, as he did in ""The Insiders""  that shows the human foibles of his characters without making them look weak or pathetic, but rather human and vulnerable.  This makes the character look all the more heroic in their pursuit of the quest, their meeting of the challenge. A hero is all the more appealing when he disposes of a truly despicable adversary.  Meeting the challenge to provide the evil, in this tale of good over evil, is Joaquin Phoenix.  This guy gave us a totally corrupt and spineless adversary from frame one.  Playing the power hungry, selfish, insecure, lying and witless, son of the Emperor, who kills his own father to gain power and then tries to seduce his own sister to satisfy his warped desires, Joaguin succeeds handily at turning the audience to the side of the out manned and helpless hero. All of this played out on the stage and setting of ancient Roman Empire. The action scenes were spectacular and well thought out.  The costuming was interesting, but I think not accurate historically.  Except for a couple of incidences of scenery players, guards and line soldiers, chewing gum, I felt that Director Ridly Scott did a good job of taking us back to a time when there was only one ball game in town, The Roman Empire. It reminds us that while world conflict takes nasty turns and is fraught with danger from the unknown and unknowable, it is equally dangerous to put all of the power into the hands of the few for the convenience of peace.",Gladiator
867,Madcapsjs,A Visual Stunner and Nice Escape on a Hot Summer day.,7,14 June 2000,"First the good, I finally got to see what the big deal about the Roman Empire was.  When you read it in books and see it in pictures it doesn't have the same punch as when it becomes a living breathing thing as it does in Gladiator.  Russel Crowe is great as Maximus and Phoenix makes Commodus the biggest wussy in recent cinema.  Overall, I give a big yippie-yahoo to Gladiator for a nice escape from whatever you are escaping from.  My only complaint?  It was just a wee bit long and the drama-love story aspect of it just was a bit of a letdown.  How long did it take Maximus to get from Germania to his house anyway?  Did anyone else notice that his hair had grown out?  Who cares, right?  Enjoy the show...but, I suggest you buy a snack and hit the head before settling in.",Gladiator

Did everybody else go to a different movie then I did? Did they not see an overlong bore? Did they not see the maybe 2 or so facial expressions Russel Crowe used in the movie that is supposed to be good acting? Did they not see the action scenes that were put in fast motion and slow motion that were completely unneeded, unartistic, and unoriginal? I wonder if Ridley Scott could have ripped off Spielberg a little more? And the dialogue! Did I hear the young emperor say, ""Im very vexed, terrible vexed!"" I laughed out loud. Was that supposed to be that funny? Or was that just horrifically bad writing? And how about those lovely computer generated lions? Complete trash.

869,Irakli28,Lacks originality,3,18 August 2000,"After seeing this film my generally neutral attitude to Fall of Roman Empire (the film the Gladiator is almost a remake of-at least the same period and the same characters, almost the same beginning and the end) to almost  an admiration. Almost forty years ago they made a watchable, highly spectacular film, with no pretention to be more than a big costume drama, with a wonderful star cast and the magnificent Sophia Loren in the midst of it. What about the gladiator? special effects used to restore the ancient rome are very good. And film is a good sample of new technical solutions for historical films. But apart from this The Gladiator has nothing to be proud of. I can say that there are at least 2 reasons for a film-addicted person like me to dislike it:1. The story. This is not even a drama, this is melodrama, plot lines concerning children and Christianity are very weak and can be used as a samples (in comparison with the above mentioned nice film of sixties) of incrreasing religiousness and family values addiction of Americans (the trends that may be are not bad as just a social-cultural phenomena but have a very bad impact on cinema). The development of the story is very flat and predictable, (europeans,especially french, often make some new interpretation of old movie themes, but always add something new and original not just to filmmaking process but to the story as well. The story of Gladiator is to polished,well known, reserved, making impression that its makers were doing everything to avoid any originality and interesting moves. 2. The cast. Well, its nod bad, but the main character looks more rather like rugby player than roman general, though his acting is rather good(though not an Oscar-worthy), Mr. Phoenix visually is rather a good type for the Emperor, but all the rest are very boring and unappealing, including the main fimale character (good looks, good acting, but.. not Sophia Loren), It was especially disappointing  to see a very bleak and unimaginative acting of great actors of the elder generation (Richard Harris and late Oliver Reed).Finally I must say that the director of this film, Mr Riddley Scott who made several very good films in his early career started loosing imagination in 90-ies. All his last films  have a very promising plot, but a rather ordinary solution. Unfortunately The Gladiator is not an exception.",Gladiator

Not only are they expertly done, most of the violence is not graphic but inferred by clever use of sound effects. But, alas, there's a story. It's a variation on the much used ""evil twin"" formula, which for some strange reason brings to mind Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. It's not always believable, the characters are almost cardboard-like, and the dialogues sometimes range between formula and pretentious.

872,tonyruben,Don't believe the hype!,6,5 June 2000,"Now don't get me wrong, Gladiator is not a bad film, it simply isn't as good as everyone seems to be saying it is.  For some reason it has captured the imagination of what I call the James Bond audience, the people who only go to the movies once or twice a year and this has artificially inflated it's rating. There are plenty of other people writing about how good the film is, so I'm going to concentrate on it's flaws.Firstly, it is far too long.  Clearly the producers wanted to make an epic like in the old days, but they seemed to have assumed that epic means length.  Wrong!  I'm sure a half-decent producer could have taken at least half and hour out of the film.  It takes far too long to get going.  After the inital battle, which for me was the high-point of the film, there is no action for about 45 mins.  This is the point where the plot takes place. The problem is, the characters are all so cardboard that the audience can easily work out what the plot is about, and five minutes here would have been more than ample.The fight scenes were some of the worst I have ever seen.  You would think Ridley Scott (or his second unit director) would have seen The Matrix, a Jackie Chan film, or at least one Martial Arts film.  That is how to direct an interesting fight; long, stationary shots showing off the skills of the stuntmen, not close-ups and constant irritating cutting on movement.  It was impossible to work out what was going on in most of the fight scenes.Thirdly, there is far too much CGI.  Yes it was impressive to recreate the Coliseum, but then they ruin the effect with overkill.  And the CGI tigers were absolutely awful.  Surely real tigers would have been cheaper and far more impressive.Fourthly, historical accuracy...  oh we don't need to bother with this, after all, it's only a movie...And don't forget the wonderful array of accents!I can't help comparing the film to Ben Hur or Spartacus and I'm afraid that Gladiator comes a poor second in terms of story and spectacle.",Gladiator
873,yulie-2,Overrated,5,1 November 2000,"I don't live in the States, so by the time Gladiator got here, I had a fair idea of what to expect - an impressive, well acted, well directed historical spectacle. And since Russell Crowe is had impressed me in the past, I went and saw it. About five minutes in I got a strange feeling that I'll end up disagreeing with the reviews.Wow, did I ever. Let's start with the acting: inconsistent best describes it. Crowe was good, though not up to his L.A Confidential and Insider standard. Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed turned in decent performances as well. Joaquin Pheonix overacted a bit but for the most part I thought he did an okay job. Richard Harris was ridiculous and Connie Nielsen was very pretty, but calling what she did acting would be a stretch. The kid was very annoying. Now, the other problems: Many sequences in the movie were so dark I couldn't see the actors' faces. Obviously not a good thing. Is this meant to convey the darkness of Maximus's predicament? The oppressiveness of the Roman Empire? The treachery of Commodus? I wonder...Still, the biggest problem was the screenplay. A lot of the dialog was plain silly, and I spent much of the movie wondering what motivated some of the characters. The whole thing seemed horribly one dimensional and contrived.Maybe it's just me? Well, I went with four friends, all of us with very different tastes. None of us enjoyed Gladiator, and I think my friend summed it up best when she said she was very impressed, but she doesn't think she liked it.Despite my rather negative opinion, I'm going with a 5/10 on account of the movie's better performances and some nice cinematography.

874,DrPrunesquallor,Why I prefer Spartacus,6,8 July 2001,"I found this film to be massively overhyped, and was unbearably derivative, particularly of Spartacus.Spartacus, on he other hand, is one of my all time favourite films. And given the immense similarities, I should have at least found Gladiator ntertaining. And I figured out why I didnt today - characters. Gladiator has none. Maximus the Gladiator is deliberately played by Crowe as a walking Zombie throughout the film, the Emperor is barking mad, and only Oliver Reed's part has any sort of substance, and even then is a carbon-copy of Peter Ustinov in Spartacus.And speaking of carbon-copies, the emperor bears a strong resemblance to John Hurt as Caligula in the classic tv series I, Claudius (incidentally, Derek Jacobi, Claudius in that series, crops up in a small role here). However, Hurt's character had far more depth and believabilitly, and most importantly, was better played.None of the other characters here really got anything to do, so that rules them out as well.At least the emperor was fairly enjoyable to watch. Joaquim Phoenix has a lot of potential, he should go far. And another thing. The score was dreadful. God knows why it sold so well. And God knows how come this film got so any Oscars. Russell Crowe as best actor? How difficult is it to look grim and stand still a lot? Dear oh dear.The best scene was the opening battle. That, at least, was brilliantly filmed and very powerful. If only the rest could have lived up to it.If you liked this, you should vastly prefer Spartacus and I, Claudius. If you havent seen this, dont bother and watch those instead.",Gladiator

876,jessestlr,I am GLAD I saw this one,8,11 July 2001,"When I saw Gladiator, I was reminded of Braveheart.  But you know what? That's actually a really good thing, seeming as I loved Braveheart. Gladiator is good on all scales.  Visually, it is probably the best film of the year.  Story, one of the top five.  Acting, one of the top five. Gladiator leaves on the edge of your seat the whole time.  What's amazing about this is you don't see many action movies that debate between systems of government, and this movie handles it so well.  This is brilliant film making, it just might be better than Braveheart.  So if you liked Braveheart, you'll LOVE this.",Gladiator
877,grant_smith,Enjoyable,9,26 October 2000,"A very entertaining movie with a reasonable storyline. More flashy but not as good as ""The fall of the Roman Empire"" which had better acting.The action footage was excellent but some of the character to character dialogue could have been improved, also the actor playing Commodus wasn't very convincing. Special effects were excellent, the creation of the atmosphere of the Colosseum was breathtaking. You felt like you were there.Opening battle scene was brilliant. Go see it!",Gladiator

This should fall somewhere within the first 3.I believed the cinematography, cool fight scenes, a great length in running time and a reasonable plot with a great actor really filled in positive slots.

879,ylings-86636,Gladiator,8,22 June 2020,"Sometimes the story of a slave changing into a general, although there are many films of the same type, looks very shocking.

The resistance crowd will always have a leader, and each person who acts as a leader has his own unique place.",Gladiator
880,zorn24601,Masterful historic epic,10,17 June 2002,"Brilliant acting, brutal battle sequences, and a concise story propel ""Gladiator"" to epic status, making it quite possibly the greatest epic of Ancient Rome ever filmed, rivalled only by ""Spartacus"".Russell Crowe proves himself to be one of the great actors of our time as he plays General Maximus, a man who only wants to live a quiet, peaceful life with his family. Instead, Maximus is hailed for his abilities in battle, first on the battlefield as he helps Emperor Marcus Aurelius expand the Empire, then in the gladiator arena after he is betrayed, sold into slavery, and forced to kill for the entertainment of the barbaric masses. Crowe shows us the General's quiet desperation to get home after the battle in Germania, his unimaginable shock at finding his family murdered, and his intense desire to avenge his family by killing Commodus, a range of emotions that many actors these days have trouble playing convincingly, but which Crowe handles perfectly.But a hero is only as good as his nemesis is bad, and Joaquin Phoenix portrays the insane Emperor Commodus flawlessly. Commodus is shown as more than a crazed dictator; he is shown as a young man who wanted to feel love from his father, but couldn't, even when his father tried to express his love for Commodus. His unsettling passion for his sister makes the audience dislike him, but his apparent love for his nephew makes him seem human, until he threatens the boy near the end. The audience comes to hate Commodus, but there is also a feeling of pity for him, and that is a hard balance for an actor to maintain. Phoenix shows that he has a long, impressive career ahead of him, and in my opinion, he should have been awarded the Best Supporting Actor Oscar when he was nominated for this role.Everything about this production is remarkable, from the almost Wagnerian score to the jarring choreography and cinematography of the battle sequences. A true masterpiece of movie making.",Gladiator
881,icclyf,Excellent,9,19 July 2020,"Great Story! Great Writing! Great Acting! Great Directing! Great Score! This movie has it all. I especially enjoyed the mood of the film. Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style. The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations. Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor."" Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine. It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla. However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles. Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers. Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators. The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate. The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene. But the whole movie is a rush! Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie. Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing. I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages. Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!",Gladiator
882,jdticktalk,Poor casting and dreary.,7,31 August 2021,Again Hollywood doesn't seem to care about appropriate casting.....just name recognition.....in essence they're saying to the audience....eat!

883,twofold420,overrated Hollywood tripe,5,13 June 2008,"How did this movie ever win best picture, and why do people like it so much? It has some of the worst dialog in the movie I have ever heard, and Connie Nielsen's ""acting"" just made me want to throw up. Not to mention the abysmal plot where there are several problems: 1) We're made to think that Commodus is a bad emperor mainly because he killed his dad and wanted to sleep with his sister. 1st thing wrong about this is that wanting to get laid with his sister doesn't have anything to do with being a bad emperor. 2nd thing is if I was in Commodus's situation, I would have killed him too for not letting me be emperor for some stupid general played by Russell Crowe.2) The general won a couple fights and suddenly he's everyone's favorite action hero.3) It's the same tired old revenge plot we've been seeing in movies for years with nothing added to make it interesting (see Kill Bill for that). Also so what that he killed his wife and son too; it's better to get them out of the way then to have them coming for revenge after killing dear old dad (although they probably wouldn't have done much), and they were not even in the movie, so I really didn't care (see Star Wars for caring that family members die).4) Problem 3 led me here about how in movies they always leave the main character alone in an easy situation he can get out of instead of just killing the loser while he's being held. (see Austin Powers for making fun of this Hollywood trend)5) The emperor would never get in a ring to fight a slave, especially when he knows he's gonna lose. How stupid! (see Spartacus for gladiator fights with purpose) Well I'm sure there's more, but these are the ones that anger me the most.Anyway there were some things I did like about the movie which are some of the action scenes were intense and exciting, and the music by James Horner was pretty darned good and enjoyable to listen to. Too bad that it wasn't part of a better movie.If the Academy wanted to pick an action movie as best picture, they should have went to the far superior Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",Gladiator
884,easmax,Lethal Weapon without car chase,3,19 February 2005,"A mediocre flick with excessive cast,excessive crowd scenes, excessive violence, excessive everything except what makes a movie more than fluffy shallow entertainment.Remembering all the rave reviews when this movie was first shown and the awards it received I was expecting to see an outstanding movie. I was surprised and disappointed.People who call this great movie must never have seen a great movie.Gladiator begins with an improbable event. The old Caesar Marcus Aurelius is along in his elaborate carriage in Geremania and he calls for his son Commodus and tells him he is not going to name him Caesar but will have his favorite general Maximumus be the leader who will bring back the Republic. for gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth. It seems we have regressed to It's highly doubtful that none of Caesars guards are near both as witness to this important act and as protectors.So of course Commudus kills the old man and then sends soldiers to kill Maximus. Maximus is severely wounded but escapes and then some how gets from Germania to what looks like a desert in North Africa !!These two improbably events are followed by dozens more. There are so many why not throw in a car chase or two...As another reviewer said,it has.. gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth. .",Gladiator

Gladiator delivers a great motion picture experience for those who like action movies with great stories and emotional intensity. It also tells people what entertainment was in roman times and it almost shows everything that happened in a gladiator arena. Russell Crowe is spectacular in this movie.

887,AdamWhite1421,Four years on and still as strong,8,9 August 2004,"Upon release this film set the world on fire. It was an amazing achievement. Four years on and it has lost some of its original charm but most of what made it great still remains. Russell Crowe deserves to be a superstar based on this performance alone. He controls the screen with such ease he was destined for good things from this moment onwards. This film also kick-started Ridley Scott's second career high which is a good thing for the movie world as he can be one of the best directors when he wants to be. The score by Hans Zimmer is as amazing as usual, I can't recall the man creating a bad soundtrack for a movie.Now for the downside. The film is only really good when Crowe is on screen. Joaquin Phoenix put in an amazing performance as the new Emperor but that didn't help the scenes in Rome from being very boring. I also can't help but cringe at the ending, only because watching the slaves walk out into the coliseum and stand around while Connie Neilsen badly acts being sad was a terrible way to end such a good film.8/10",Gladiator

889,AlTheReviewer,The Gladiator,10,11 April 2014,"The Gladiator, directed by Ridley Scott is a classic. It is a film that can only be described as beautiful and elegant, with a storyline based on heartbreak and revenge. Russell Crowe gives the performance of his life as Maximus the Roman General who seeks revenge for the betrayal and murder of his family by the deceased emperors corrupt son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). You follow his struggle from near death to retribution in a mind blowing performance of grit and determination, given by his love and memories.

896,osric4,Good but Oscar worthy???,9,28 July 2001,Ok is it oscar worthy yes and no.  It is a very good movie and should get awards for the Visual effects as they were absalutly wonderful but best picture??? I think Not.  For one yes it did have good directing but Ang Lee was better in Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Acting.  Ok it did have good acting but sorry Tom Hanks Did a better job then Russell Crowe.  Other then that yes it was a good movie it had a ok storyline and for the acting that was good but lacked a few things as did the story line.  For one the story was the same throughout the whole movie you knew what was going to happen before it happened.  Fight after Fight.  Sorry he wouldn't have lasted but maybe 3 fights not as many as he did.  So people say it's a movie it dosn't have to be accurate.  Well I think it should be somewhat accurate.  other then that it did hold my attention and the music was totally good.  Richard harris did a good job.  It's a good movie and it's worth watching but it really didn't earn best picture in my opinion.  That would go to crouching Tiger hidden Dragan. (own both on DVD) I'd Give it a 8/10,Gladiator
897,nateman-2,A masterpiece that reaches back 1800 years to become ahead of its time!,10,6 May 2000,"An evil leader who acquires power by lies and brutality. An evil man who despite the efforts of many good men continues to prevail. An evil man who wants to remove all the remaining traces of the republic. An evil man  who wants to be loved by the people but is twisted and perverted . An evil man whose sole talent is knowing how to play to the mob. It is so close to the current situation in Washington that I'm surprised this movie was even made.     The beginning of the end of Rome started when Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his army and turned Rome from a republic to a dictatorship. A similar point was reached recently when a corrupt and cowardly senate declared that a president in effect was above the law. Abuse of power was free to flow from that point and the life of Rome slowly flowed away with it.    This movie if anything embodies the hope that men of good character can still overcome a juggernaut of evil and turn the tide. To say that this movie provokes no thought or that the ending was a letdown only shows that they did not understand the greater significance of this movie. How it speaks to our own time and offers hope and inspiration to those few good men still remaining. That in this dark hour, when stock options act like bread and circuses to mask the accumulating corrupt concentration of power to one evil man, that character still DOES count and that good men with strength and honor can still prevail.",Gladiator

900,brichtr1,Have people forgotten what a GOOD movie IS??,10,12 July 2002,"I am as amazed as confused at how anyone could find this movie anything less that a masterpiece. A triumph in acting, special effects, directing, setting design, costume design, plot, dialogue, and anything else associated with movie-making. Long ago, when movies were time-spent productions, when only one movie would come out in theatres a month, when a movie earning 4 stars wasn't a rarity.. this was the time when audiences knew how good some movies could be. (Hence all the classics.) It's frightening to see today what movies have become. With 3 movies coming out each week, sometimes many more, it's hard to determine the quality from the ""merely entertaining"". Some movies have their moments. Almost every one does. A funny one-liner, a cool death scene, or a wicked plot twist. But this doesn't make up a good movie. That isn't what it's all about.What also needs to be realized, is that when someone thinks of a movie as their ""favorite movie"" or a movie that they ""hated"", they are merely saying their opinion about it, which has nothing to do with the movie itself. Obviously what one person thinks of as a great movie is not the universal definition for cinematic greatness. (I remember my brother feeling betrayed when Corky Romano wasn't nominated for an Oscar). For example: what one person may hate about a movie, another person may love about it for the exact opposite reason (An overprotective parent may hate this movie for it's violence, while if it had been cuddles a bunnies, some ""macho man"" may have hated it too.) Truly these are not grounds to be judging movies. However, there are universal traits for movies which one can rate a movie on. (Acting, story, etc.) Perhaps this is why we have award ceremonies. Because some people can't decide for themselves what good acting really is.
As a serious movie lover, these are my strong opinions. I am merely trying to make sense of all the negative comments about this movie.(God I wrote a lot!) My opinion about it anyways::  In my opinion Joaquin Phoenix MADE the movie. (My FAVORITE actor!) Russell Crow was great in this type of role, but Joaquin did an AMAZING job. He was able to portray the bad guy but with soul (Something VERY difficult to do.) This was obviously overlooked however at the Oscars. The Academy must have forgotten how much easier it is to be the guy everyone loves, the ""good guy"". The story itself seems to be the reason we loved Maximus. We felt sorry for him. We wanted him to win. Whereas Joaquin was just so damn GOOD at it, you HATED Commodus within the first 5 minutes. He was so damn good at being bad. You must judge good acting NOT only by how well they preformed, but how into character, and how believable, and how 3-D their character was(not always in the actor's control), and how hard their role was to bring to life. I know this is becoming a Joaquin praise rather than a review, but I think this was the BEST I have ever seen him. BESIDES Joaquin, the MOVIE is nothing short of spectacular. A true movie is inspiring, it's good at what it does. (In this case it can make you cry for an hour after the movie's over, feel suspense, and realize that this is more than fiction which little people do.) We need to remember that this stuff really happened. Obviously being 2000 years from the time it took place, it isn't entirely accurate. But than again, when was the last time a documentary won Best Picture? Would any of YOU see a documentary with such enthusiasm? Would it have made enough money to pay for the lavish settings and costumes the crew would have to create? NO!! Which is why it is a MOVIE. Besides, for NOT being a doc, it actually IS pretty damn accurate. Almost all the characters were real -except Maximus- and the fact that Rome was/is real at all is amazing enough. The recreations of everything to the gravel is breathtaking. The sets are so beautiful and real, you feel immediately as though you are in ancient Rome. Also the corruption and insanity that was going on with the politics back then is also there. They were murdering each other left and right! (Due to the lead poisoning.)So the themes fit as well.
It is also a very simple yet powerful story which any decent human being can sympathize and relate to. So in short, it really IS a good movie, not worthy of the ignorant, inane comments by some who probably couldn't tell a Shakespeare masterpiece from the Nutrition Facts on a Snickers Bar.~Rhea",Gladiator
901,The Love Dragon,Old fashioned fun.,7,22 February 2001,"When I first saw GLADIATOR in the theatre, I was amazed. I hadn't seen anything like it before. When I saw it on video, I began to actually consider the film, as one always does. I found it quite different.What makes a motion picture good. The acting has to be good, the story original, the directing careful and good, the dialogue realistic, the screenplay well written, the cinematography original AND good, and entertaining.In Gladiator, the acting is great, fantastic, even. Phoenix is evil as Commodus, Harris on target as Marcus Aurelius, Nielson convincing as Commodus' sister, and seems to care for Maximus and her child. Russell Crowe amazing, being exactly what the writer and director wanted him to be: tough, caring, slightly emotionless, though, and at times funny.The story is quite original, it mixes true historical events and fictional sequences alike to create something wholly new. The pacing is perfect, and the dialogue  and screenplay are good. The sub plots are involving and one comes to care for the charcters.The cinematography tells a good story. Old fashioned camera angles are used, as well as technically impressive photographing techniques are employed in the film. The action scenes are exactly what Scott wants them to be, confusing, violent, compelling, and showing not only the common horrors of war and violence, but also those invovled's feelings and what it was like to be there in them.There is no question that Gladiator is not entertaining- it is! Old fashioned Rome stuff and today's violence, as well as involving charcters.So why not like the film? Okay, there are historical inaccuraces, but Scott doesn't want it to be real. Spartacus had inaccuraces, Ben-Hur did, too, no one is complaining of them.In addition to the above things, the art direction is beautiful, the score compelling, the costume design good (however inaccurate), and some good old Braveheart style violence.I keep thinking to myself, this film isn't that great, it doesn't even deserve a nomination, but then I think about what I tell you, and I realize it really is a great film.I have not seen Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon or Chocolat, so I can't say anything about those. However, Erin Brokovich was just awful! But I'm reviewing Gladiator here. Traffic was gret too, but I have only seen it once in  the theartre, so I have not really had a chance to truly evaluate it.In conclusion, Gladiator is an amzing film, not to be missed. I give it eight out of ten, but even now I find that I am giving it a lesser score than I think it should. I don't want to like this film, but I can;t help it!",Gladiator
902,cheitman23,"Entertaining, but really.....",7,26 March 2001,"After the Academy Awards, I have to temper my displeasure a bit. This was not a bad movie at all. It is quite good compared to, say, Demetrius and the Gladiators. But this has to be the most overrated movie to win Best Picture since Forrest Gump. Even more overrated than Titanic. Take one part Spartacus, one third Braveheart, and one third Caligula and blend. The female character is pure window dressing, the effects are poor but thankfully used sparingly.The period armour and weapons are all wrong. The tacked-on ""going home"" racial liberation bit at the end is pure hokum. In it's defense, the film does have two very fine performances (rewarded) and some terrific action sequences.Still, I am sad that we could not have seen the award go to one of the more challenging and visionary films, Crouching Tiger or Traffic.

I enjoy Russell Crowe but felt his Oscar award should have waited for A Beautiful Mind...not Gladiator. Juaquin Phoenix was very nearly as good as Christopher Plummer's Commodus in Fall of the Roman Empire.  I enjoyed watching the film for it's special effects and opening battle scene to see how closely Scott came to recreating a real battle.  I looked at the costuming, weaponry, etc. and in all respects I think Ridley Scott did an outstanding job...I was convinced I was seeing Rome, Romans, and Roman battle.  But, the story itself paled in comparison to the wonderful effects!  I felt in my heart the animosity, the loathing that came between Ben Hur and Messala.  I did not get that kind of feeling with Maximus and Commodus.  You cannot help but feel the agony of Ben Hur who, having defeated his mortal enemy, finds out from Messala's last words that the ""race is not over"".  At the end of Gladiator, it's ""who will help me carry a great Roman"" and off we go.  I never quite understood why the other gladiators were so quick  to die for Maximus.  After all, he was there to kill them.  (the charioteers from the Battle of Zama scene were gladiators also..at least that's how it would have historically been).  I could not buy into Commodus's thinking on letting Maximus live.  The real Commodus would not have hesitated, Maximus would have been executed on the spot when he revealed his face.  I'm hoping that more classically developed stories of ""real"" characters will be well filmed when they show up in 2003-2004 (""Alexander the Great"", ""Troy"" and ""Hannibal"").  I'd love to see Ridley Scott-style special effects in all these but...with story lines that I can really feel in my gut.",Gladiator
907,primevalsoup,Brilliant,10,26 October 2008,"Great action, story and acting. Full marks for being one of the best films ever made.It is not historically accurate with the plot but that's not the point (it seems a mash of different events and people who existed at one time or another in during the Roman Empire. From what I know of ancient Rome the story is within the realms of possibility.) The characters are all great. Pheonix is annoying but intentionally so - he acts his character perfectly. The script is kind of poetic at times - it seems it underwent at least three full scale revisions by different masters of script writing.There are a number of different accents in the film but then Rome was probably a pretty multicultural place and we're hardly going to wish they had made it in Latin.",Gladiator
908,arthursranch,Uneven and Pretentious,3,26 December 2013,"Ouch. This was the first DVD I ever purchased, and the first I gave to the local thrift store.First of all, I was subjected to Richard Harris all too much at the beginning, and what was that all about? How did that contribute to the film? Film is all about compression of characters and more-or-less smooth progression through the story. I'd have left the Richard Harris part on the cutting room floor. To present ""the wrong person is on the throne"" can be done very effectively in many other (shorter) ways.Second of all, Joaquin Phoenix's character was wholly one-dimensional, the result of which was a uniformly downward-feeling mood. Think of Stephen Boyd in Wyler's Ben Hur. Of course, Gladiator was a kind of remake of that one, which was a remake of a really good one. I now better appreciate Francis X Bushman.And what was the dog all about? I get all that Roman Valhalla stuff, but the execution was pretty corny, all dreamy and, can I say it, cheap. And let me digress - Richard Harris's part in Caviezel's Count of Monte Cristo might better have been left 60% on the cutting room floor. It gave the same problem, taking time and focus from the meat of the story.Gladiator was a one-and-done for me.",Gladiator
909,s13ky,The struggle of a man in finding justice,8,13 July 2012,"Gladiator has been my most favorite film of all time. It is an epic masterpiece in many ways and it really explains why despite the numerous viewings, Gladiator still amuses me with its powerful imagery and many other crucial aspects so that it won five Academy Awards. This film is very well written, the well-ensemble casts, the A-class acting (especially Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix), the stunning cinematography and definitely a strong character of Maximus (magnificently portrayed by Russell Crowe) whose life, struggle, disappointment and anger really move the audience, as if the world attention centers on him. Gladiator is not a historical film, because it only used the history of the ancient Roman Empire merely as the time setting. All other aspects namely those gorgeous shots, the great storyline/plot, the fantastic cinematography, the vividly lavish colors, detailed production design and digital imaging (that successfully rebuilt the stunning beauty of the ancient Roman Empire) and all sell really well, making the 170 minute-long running time definitely worthwhile. The visual of great battle in the first 15 minutes really stole my heart. The gruesome pictures, the blood and violence just to beautiful to abandon. Everything in this movie seems perfectly balanced, Ridley Scott as the film director really did his homework well in redefining and revitalizing the big battle sequence once considered masterpiece from Spartacus and Ben Hur. In the end, once again, I would say that Gladiator perfectly combines some crucial elements such as good, moving story, dazzling visual, beautiful scenery, filming techniques, direction and touching music score into one harmonious, action-packed film about heroism and its true meaning.",Gladiator
910,Skoveng77,And here it is! My favorite movie of all time!,10,11 February 2006,"Yes, finally I get the time to comment my undisputed favorite! Gladiator is my favorite movie because it gave me the opportunity to a bit of a 'teaser' of what I could expect in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. But since Hollywood altered and messed up LotR, Gladiator remains my all time favorite. However!!! My favorite thing to do (as you all know), is to rap down on my favorites. This time, Gladiator must pay. Hehe >:)Gladiator did one very serious mistake; it mixed fiction and reality. That's a mistake that a. o. Xena: Warrior Princess made several times. (There, they portrayed the Troyan war to occur sometime during Julius Ceasar's reign as war Marshall. These two event, both actual events from history, occurred with a void of 400 years between.) They started of the film with the Romans going to war in Germanica. And winning. This is wrong. The Roman Empire never seized Germanica, and never won any battles there. (Except for Italy beating Germany in soccer a couple of times.) They continue with Commodus, son of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, kills his father to become the new Emperor. This I cannot verify as a true event or not, but it seems far-fetched. I don't buy. However, it does make a good drama scene. And they end the movie with Emperor Commodus being killed by his former general, Maximus, now turned gladiator, in the Colosseum. Now, it is true that Commodus did fight gladiators in the Colosseum, and it is likely that that's how he died, I do not know this for sure myself. But, the film's main character, Maximus, is merely a character of fiction, so if Commodus was killed in the Colosseum, it was not by him. Except for this, the film is the absolute best in its genre, and yes, I still consider it a lot better than the LotR trilogy. Here's my five reasons why. 1. Gladiator had to start from scratch. No one had heard of it before its first press release and premiere. LotR has been common knowledge for more than 40 years. 2. LotR was written by one of the worlds's greatest and most intelligent authors of all time. How are you suppose to best that? I'm not saying that the Gladiator script was better than the LotR books, but at least it was an honest piece of work. 3. Like millions of other LotR fans, my expectations for the trilogy was sky high. And from a book reader's point of view, I was more or less disappointed when I saw the result. This was not Tolkien, this was Hollywood. Gladiator was more Hollywood than LotR, but we didn't expect it to be anything else either. 4. When Gladiator was, and remains to this day, completely free! Unlike, LotR, it's not tied down by copyrights and spinoffs and merchandicing and whatnot. You might find a couple of t-shirts or something out there, but they would most likely only be promotional or something. The LotR concept have released billions of merchandice, and they are dependant on these things being sold, and they expect a certain amount of profit. What was once a wonderful piece of authory art and the most loved and respected piece of fantasy literature of all time has become a money machine. Shame! Gladiator is of course making a lot of money still, but no everybody expected that to happen. And at last 5. Gladiator clearly thought of real talent and realistic appearance before popularity and sex appeal. Compare Russell Crowe's MAximus and Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn anyday, and I am very sure you will have to admit that Russel's MAximus will come out victorious. Russell looks like a regular, everyday worker. A bit grimy and rustic, and hard knocked. Maximus looked like he hadn't seen water ever most of the film and it fit him well. Ergo, Russell fits the bill when a character needs to be down and dirty. Viggo Mortensen, who is a very good looking fellow to begin with, was made to look good as Aragorn, even when Aragorn was dirtied up or injured. He was always stylish, even in the Ranger rags he wore. Now don't get me wrong, the LotR trilogy is so definitely worth a watch, but I don't think you should watch with any expectations whatsoever, and certainly not with the books in mind.So, my recommendations are as follows; watch Gladiator if you don't have the time to watch any of the Lord of the Rings films. I can guarantee that you will be just as entertained, if not more.One more note; this movie was also Oliver Reed's last film as he died during the shooting of the film in Malta due to heart failure. He was 61. The film is dedicated in his memory.",Gladiator
911,captain-balrog,Is this the same guy that made Blade Runner? Seriously?,1,28 December 2012,"Well I hated this film; I've hated nearly all Ridley Scott's films. Loved Alien; Loved Blade Runner. Then I hated everything up to American Gangster, which I thought was alright but not fantastic. Robin Hood was the next one I hated. Then came Prometheus, which I didn't hate, but after three viewings I'm still wondering if it was just a really expensive commercial for Christianity. Still, at least Russell Crowe wasn't in it.Russell Crowe! Does he know something about all the big Hollywood directors that they don't want made public? Did he find their sex dungeon? Seriously, how is he getting all these roles? It certainly isn't on ability. I think he might actually be a worse actor than Sean Connery.That's the main problem with Gladiator, and with many of Ridley Scott's films. Russell Crowe is in them, and I think it's a sign of Scott's increasingly poor judgement. Yes, I grant you, Russell Crowe may have appeared to be good in Romper Stomper, but we now know that he actually is a mentally challenged thug with delusions of grandeur so it doesn't count.Anyway, there are other issues, like the mind numbing tedium of watching an unimaginative director play with his enormous budget for hours, or the excruciatingly familiar plot lurking beneath the costumes, or the pantomime bad guy hammed into the middle of next week by Joaquin Phoenix.That brings me back to the acting, and the Crowe. Crowe time! That's what my inside voice shouts when he appears; it helps me get through films that he's in. The worst instance of Crowe time! in Gladiator is the bizarrely comical moment where he finds his character's family dead and tries to act accordingly; it's like an acting version of karaoke. I started to think that the original role was played by Harvey Keitel and he was probably this Australian bloke's favourite actor.Story wise, it's like a badly remembered history lesson retold in the style of Dallas, or Prisoner Cell Block H, at least that's the way the ""Dramatic"" scenes come across; the action is much more in the direction of a period Arnold Schwarzenegger film where the bad guys appear to have run straight out of a computer game just in time to be slain due to their low skill level and intelligence. Don't get me wrong, I like Arnie; you know where you stand with Arnie. Ditto computer games. The problem here is that it seems really out of context.Some people have complained about the historical accuracy; I don't care about that. I'm not overly interested in the Roman Empire and as a result the level of historical detail/accuracy would be lost on me anyway. I mean, if Attenborough started telling me that Gorillas are actually cleverly disguised Ninjas I'd be a bit annoyed – assuming peer review established such a claim to be untrue – but I went into Gladiator expecting a film not a documentary.I'm not saying that accuracy is never an issue; I'm from Belfast and I know that a great many people were upset at the awful way the Titanic disaster was treated by Hollywood. You can't help but wonder if, somewhere in Hollywood, there's a script for a whimsical look at the Hindenburg sitting on someone's desk.I think it's long past time we all stopped expecting the next great Ridley Scott film; it isn't going to happen. Ridley Scott is not a great director. David Lynch is a great director. David Cronenberg is a great director. David Lean is a great director. Why are they all called David? I don't know. In Britain high profile political journalists are called John. No one knows why",Gladiator

913,davelock-00029,One of the best i've seen,10,10 June 2017,Gladiator is about the warrior Maximus . The film is set in Italy back in the Roman age . It tells the story of Maximus the warrior who became a gladiator that fights for his life in the arenas.I love the story and the performance of the actors in the film . Russel Crowe stars as Maximus and Juaquin Phoenix plays the role of Commodus ( the son of the emperor ) . Commodus is my favorite character because he has a very interesting personality .I think this is an ideal film for people who like action movies and bloody combats . It is a bit sad but it has a great ending to it,Gladiator
914,EugeneandSasha,Gladiator is better than...,9,1 November 2005,"Gladiator is the best epic war film. Gladiator has the best war scenes I've ever scene. Better than Troy and much better than Alexander. I liked the digital effects in Gladiator. Troy and Alexander are pretty fun to watch, but in Alexander, i really want to forward it to exciting scenes, like war sequences. Gladiator, I can just sit there and watch it, because if you miss a part, you won't get it. The end was great, i really liked it. It was the best fight scene at the end. Every part kept me interested and there wasn't one part that bored me. It had one of the best endings ever. So if your tired of crappy, imitating war movies go to this one it's the best there is.10/10",Gladiator
915,Deviator-4,People give this movie too much credit,7,7 May 2000,"Although it was not a bad movie, it was not all that good of a movie either. Ridley Scott seems to get more entertaining scripts every time he directs, but he gets worse and worse at directing. The battle scenes drove me up the wall.  The cameras are so close-up that all we can see is blood and movement.  The resolution is grainy and dirty looking, which makes it even harder to see.  Scott must also believe that the only way to show battle is by filming it like a music video.  A few seconds of a camera shot is shown, then a second of another shot, then another shot, then another and another for five minutes straight.  Now it's not only hard to see, but dizzying as well.  A better director would have used longer shots to show off good fight choreography, development and tactics of battle. But Scott takes the easy way out.Now we know we can't rely on the director for a good movie. The cast overall is good.  Commodus (Phoenix) has a few good moments, but is just too dull to be enjoyed as a villain.  Scott tries to give us pity for the bad guy to add depth to his character, but it doesn't work.  I didn't feel anything for him, hatred or pity.  I was a little surprised that Phoenix wasn't better than he was in the role of Commodus.  He is a talented actor and he was by far the best part of '8mm', but he will work for this movie.  The supporting cast does a good job in few scenes that they posses.  The gladiators are big and mean enough, the senators do their job to move the story along, but the best supporting performances come out of Proximo (Reed) and Commodus's sister, Lucilla(Nielson). As important as the supporting cast is, everything rides on Crowe's performance as Maximus. He does wonderful.  He carries this movie on his back with little help.  He broods and glares and doesn't talk much.  He has great reaction shots and is a good physical actor.  Without him, this movie has little redeeming qualities.With Crowe leading the charge, the movie is marginally entertaining and worth going to see.  But don't sit to close to the screen, the camera shots might make you nauseous.",Gladiator
916,PennGirl,Russell Crowe is a Roman god,10,20 July 2000,"This movie was fantastic.  Far from just a typical guts n' gore warrior flick, the actors succeeded at portraying genuine feeling, emotion, and motivation for their actions.  While on the surface, the plot line may seem implausible, the characters' passion brings it to life and a shocking reality.  You walk out of the theater honestly believing that Maximus' desire for vengeance, combined with his skill as a general, could lead him from slavery to the doorstep of the emperor. And as if that were all not enough, Russell Crowe is a modern-day Adonis.  I'll be first on line when the DVD comes out.",Gladiator
917,BigMan-12,Even Roger Ebert is wrong once in a while...,8,9 June 2000,"I can't understand for the life of me why he was so harsh on this picture. This is easily one of the best movies I've seen in a long time.  It kicks the crap out of Titanic, by a long shot.  Basically, take an event film like Titanic, but add real actors and a better plot...I totally fail to understand how someone could fault this film for bad graphics while praising Titanic.  Certain scenes from that movie look so bad as to be laughable.  (I'm thinking of long external shots of the boat at night...)Russell Crowe kicks ass in this role.  He's every bit as good here as he was in ""The Insider.""",Gladiator
918,Allen-27,Disappointingly Lacking,6,12 May 2000,"When going to a Ridley Scott movie, I always feel a sense of security that I will be delighted with the cinematography, if nothing else.  This foray into computer enhanced filming is horrible.  Cleopatra, 30 years ago, was far more realistic since it was...well...real.  Certainly, computers reduce the cost to produce a movie of this scope, but one is always aware that one is looking at a computer image.  In old movies, where sets were built, there was no way to be sure that the movie wasn't filmed at an old ruin.  The scenery was made of physical materials, not virtual images.  Every time I saw those little pixels in the Coliseum flickering I was totally distracted. The whole movie, from a technical standpoint, is a case of ""The Emperor's New Clothes.""",Gladiator
919,Gigante,What else is there to say?,10,5 November 2000,What other good can I say about this film that hasn't been said already? Gladiator is simply one of the most impressive films ever made.Superb acting from the two male leads (Crowe and Phoenix). Brilliant fight sequences. Massive sets and great scenery. Tension building music. Excellent special effects. Erm....did I mention the fight sequences?Gladiator will go down as one of the greatest films of all time and too right. It is a rollercoaster ride from start to finish and will keep you hooked throughout. The sword and sandals epic makes a welcome return to the cinema and I only hope there are more classics to come in the next few years as we saw with the likes of Spartacus and Ben Hur of the past.,Gladiator
920,Addie-7,"An old-fashioned hero, brilliantly portrayed",9,29 June 2001,"There isn't much I can add that hasn't already been said, but what made this movie so special for me was Russell Crowe's brilliant portrayal of Maximus as a genuine hero of Shakespearean proportions.  I don't mean to imply that there is any resemblance between Gladiator and one of Shakespeare's plays, or that the dialogue resembles one of them. But the creation of a truly heroic character in a pivotal role is a classical and, unfortunately, out of date device.  It requires an actor who can not only convince you that his character possesses a heroic and noble nature, but who can also make you care terribly about what happens to this hero.  Crowe does both.  The viewer loves and admires his Maximus, and agonizes with him in his travails.  In this, Crowe reminded me of Laurence Olivier at a comparable age, although I'd guess he would cringe at the comparison. As to the rest of the cast, I couldn't find a single weak link.  In fact, the only thing I didn't like about the movie was the extent of the gore in the battle and gladiator scenes.  I can't believe that so many prolonged grisly scenes were necessary to get the movie's point across.",Gladiator
921,Overjoyed,Great film that was a pleasant surprise.,10,3 August 2000,"I wasn't going to see this movie, the ad campaign just didn't draw me in. About a week after it's debut, my friend treated me to this movie and I must say I was pleasantly surprised. It had a great story and the action in this movie was just perfect. I remember just being filled with great excitement whenever a Gladiator fight broke out. I really liked Russell Crowe in this film, an actor I didn't even know existed until this movie was released. I like how they make the bad guy Comodus so maniacally insane in some aspects that you kind of pity him, yet you know he is nothing but a brat and needs his just due. I recommend Gladiator.",Gladiator
922,cookedw,"Entertaining, yet typical",5,4 June 2000,"While Russell Crowe did a decent job in this film, the movie certainly lacked in substance.  While I will say I was entertained, by the end of the film, I was very ready to leave.  To start it off, not only is the storyline cliched, but a good portion of it was taken from Braveheart.  In all fairness, any heroic tale will have similar concepts, but there were too many direct parallels to be ignored.  Secondly, the acting was nothing spectacular -- Crowe did a wonderful job (with the little he was given to work with), but Joaquin Phoenix left his character as shallow as one comes to expect from a big-budget Hollywood film.  There were two scenes I was impressed by in the film -- the opening battle, and the battle re-enactment in the Coliseum.  The opening sequence was shot very masterfully -- I thought the camera effects and silence definitely added to the intensity. The scene in the Coliseum was pretty cool, too, but it lacked the depth and sincerity of the opening sequence.  Instead, its use of teamwork and anticipation was stolen directly from the scene in Braveheart with the large wooden spears used against the cavalry.  The storyline is very uninspired, the characters are shallow, and there is no need to use your brain at any point.  All in all, the film lacked depth.  It was what has become of Hollywood -- large budget = crowdpleaser = crap.  Gladiator, you've failed as a film - 46%.",Gladiator
923,Young Garrett,The Classic Hollywood film of 2000.,8,14 October 2000,"Rome was the greatest and most advanced civilisation the world has ever seen, yet corruption was to eat out it's heart. This story shows how a good emperors legacy can be bled by an evil despot (his son) and the rightful heir nearly deposed. Near perfect characters make this movie a real winner. Crowe esspecially is a great gladiator/general, his face shows all the hardships one would face in such a trying time. The betrayl of Maximus (Crowe) makes the viewer feel nothing but contempt for the old Emperor's evil son.The rest of the movie aside, the one image from this film that will last is Maximus walking through the long grass fields with his brushing against it. It does bare resemblance to The Thin Red Line in this respect.",Gladiator
924,watrmeln,"An exciting hack and slash movie, but little else",6,15 May 2000,"Billed as an epic (and certainly long enough to be one), Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" had me anxiously waiting for its release for almost 3 months. Imagine -- Spartacus meets the modern movie techno-wizardry!  The potential was enormous.The opening scene, with its hundreds, if not thousands, of soldiers, overwhelmed me by its sheer magnitude.  Scott captures the fear, bloodiness, and brutality of war while at the same time, embuing Gen. Maximus (Russell Crowe) with an amazing gift for leadership.  The repulsive beauty of violence has rarely been captured as well on film.Though the action scenes were amazing, the plot left me wanting more.  The superb acting by Joaquin Phoenix as Emperor Commodius was skillfully complemented by Connie Nelson's Lucilla, conveying to us their tension-filled relationship.  However, the basic premise of paternal neglect begetting cruelty never truly sells.  Kudos to Phoenix for valiantly trying to rescue this crucial plot weakness with his acting skill.Crowe remains, throughout the movie, nobly removed from the rest of humanity.  This is both his strength and weakness, as his relationship with Lucilla was unconvincing.  Though both actors were great individually, their on-screen chemistry never truly smoldered.  Not enough attention was paid to their history and I left the movie wanting more.""Gladiator"" begins on a strong note but fails to capitalize.  If you're looking for a great modern epic, stick to ""Braveheart"" or ""Saving Private Ryan.""  Excellent action and CGI can only compensate so far for weak plot development.",Gladiator
925,doozer333,A Classy Pop Corn Movie,9,29 May 2000,"You've always got to review a movie based on what it set out to do. Gladiator set out to be a grand, summer movie, action set piece. And it did that. Masterfully. And most glorious of all, it didn't make you feel guilty for enjoying it. The plot was thin but it was solid. Everything that took place happened for a distinct reason that was in context with the time period and the characters. The characters themselves were written archetypically. Maximus is the unflawed hero, Commodus is the sniveling villain, Proximo is the scoundrel with a heart of gold etc, but the performances took all of them to another level and made you care. Russel Crowe in particular is a master of doing just that. Give that boy a cliché, and he will beat it into submission. And he will do it sexily, which doesn't hurt. The action scenes are big and exciting but never unbelievable or embarrassing. To grade Gladiator as an extremely serious, epic film in the same mold as say, Spartacus, is a bit unfair. It is a summer action movie, but it is a smart, well done, and exciting summer action movie that thrills its audience without playing down to them.",Gladiator

Commodus is bad because he wants his sister but they never show his egomaniacal nature.DIALOGUE(2) : Some truely great lines from Maximus and Proximo can't cover-up the obtuse expositional lines.

Sweeping set pieces, heroic feats of courage and villianous deeds of deceit that actually happened!
I mean ---- after seeing the first two shots of this movie (hand in the wheat shot and Maximus w/ the bird shot) who among us did not believe that we were going to see something of a transcendent nature? I certainly did. Even after the first 30 minutes I felt like it was fulfilling my expectations. The small touches : Maximus' faithful dog, the frost sticking the blade in the scabbard, the small statues of Max's family leant a certain ""realness"" to the opening reel that never carries over.Unfortunately, some sloppy directing, a poorly concieved story, and some of the stalest dialogue ever helped to ruin the film for me. Not to mention the complete WWF'ing of the gladiator concept and some poor effects/art direction. They took a great concept and turned it into a parody.Yes, I know I need some cheese w/ my whine but I'm just tired of seeing movies where things so blatantly violate my suspension of disbelief. When an effect is clearly just that - you can't help but be bounced out of the story. Each of the effects shots of the city and the stadium appeared to have been done by a different effects house w. it's own individual style. To compensate for the poorly done effects a dark shadow was cast over the entire production to hid the shortcomings that CGI brings.(NOTE : I have heard that the in all locations save LA and Arizona movies are shown at 75% of their original brightness. So this could have some effect of how good the effects looked.)When dialogue is spoken on such a broad level (for international translations, of course) that you are re-writing it in your head, viewership becomes tetious.When things end in The Big Fight(What ever happened to The Palace Coup?) the film becomes just another typical Hollywood production.
When lip service is giving to the ""Afterlife"" and ""gods"" and ""the senate"" and those ideas are never explored beyond being character arc or plot mechanisms you feel cheated.In my opinion the kung fu aspect of Gladiator is what gets it such high marks among audiences (especially on the internet).""Damn, did you see the way he stuck those two swords into that guy and then chopped his head off with both blades! Awesome!""Now I have no problem w. styling violence but the type of one- up-manship that has been occuring since SPR and the Matrix ultimately hurts things that really matter.

927,emilian77,The only realistic movie about ancient Rome history,9,4 August 2001,"The producers of this movie must know well ancient history, and, in the same time, they know well how to add fantastic elements to transform a simple movie into an awesome one...Surprisingly, this movie shows high class elements in scripting, direction, acting, photography and action scenes.The opening is epic; it represents a battle between Romans and ancient Germans. Never a movie on ancient history has shown a battle scene so well realised; not only it is highly exciting and dramatic but also, there is a historic realism in representation, battle technics, nomenclature. Apart classic elements, like an exciting show of the Roman phalanx in action covered with shields repelling German's arrows, You will see a series of innovative realistic historic features: very good costumes, war dogs, catapults and so long. The battle shown in ""Spartacus"", although good, was less realistic, and surely was far less enjoying and thrilling.Another important thing is that this movie, unlike all other of its genre, shows the real religion of ancient Romans (substantially, the adoration of ancestors) with realism, respect and seriousness, not like old movies of this type, where this religion was considered only ""paganism"" and never showed. And then, after this, You have wonderful actors and fantastic plot, perhaps a free variation on the real story of the despotic Commodus (in the reality, Commodus was killed in 192 a.c. by an ambush of a gladiator, Narcissus, hired by his sister and the Senate).It is really the case to say: thumb up!",Gladiator

929,ryder_78,Magnifico,10,19 February 2007,"I'll make this short since there are probably thousands of reviews here already.This is the 2nd movie after Saving Private Ryan that reduced me to tears at the end of the show. The success of this film was largely made possible by the talented director, great cast and a huge budget allocated for the movie. Although Crowe was the lead actor, much credit have to be given to Richard Harris and Joaquin Phoenix(not forgetting Oliver Reed) for adding depth and character into the movie. If I were only allowed to choose one, I would pick Harris(in portraying the slain emperor) as the best supporting actor over Joaquin, Oliver or Connie Nielsen. I think his performances are very powerful and not to mention the fact that I particularly admire his incredible acting in the scene where he told Joaquin he was not going to be his heir to the throne. His gestures, his expressions when listening to Joaquin's rant were just so real that you really feel for him being an aging but noble emperor.Russell Crowe is better off given roles as a fighter(for a good cause) just like James Braddock in that boxing movie. He's still better suited to movies with patriotic kind of battles such as this one in Gladiator. Crowe just sucks big time acting in dramas and movies with love elements. Please we don't want to see him fall in love with Meg Ryan! We want an action star out of Russell!! I hope the directors are reading this so that Crowe can be given more roles that involve leading a pack of army or something and turn out to be a hero at the end. Never mind if he's dead or alive at the end of the show but it just adds more compassion and probably reduce some folks to tears if he really fails to keep on breathing at the end.My 2 cents worth.",Gladiator
930,mukor,Ben Hur Lite,3,16 July 2001,"Gladiator is an infuriating movie, an immensely overrated Ben Hur light that is clearly a graduate of the Armageddon school of filmmaking.  Nevertheless, it does some things very well.  And this is the problem perhaps. The combat sequences are a sight to behold, as exhilarating in their beautiful bloodshed as anything Ridley Scott has ever done (and he is the American master of beautiful bloodshed). But the drama that connects these sequences seem only filler, existing only to move us (sometimes in a most incoherent way geographically speaking) to the next moment Russell Crowe gets to bear his teeth and fight another battle.  But how is this a good movie?  If anything Gladiator is more of a punched up, swords a blazing series of dance numbers.  The drama rests on the shoulders of a one note performance by Russell Crowe, whose core emotion seems to be one of grimace and pout.  He is a character who has one desire and one desire only:  revenge.  Many critics loved the intensity of the performance but why?  A complex, interesting character should have complexity to them.  But this character has no complexity, no range of emotions: he is a Stallone character trapped in an art film.Joaquim Phoenix, on the other hand, was a delight, an over the top sociopath who brings a few precious moments of levity to an otherwise drab, ugly, and humorless film.",Gladiator
931,techspec,This is a truly great epic film in the vein of Spartacus.,9,3 May 2004,"Russell Crowe plays a general in the Roman army who through a series of treacherous actions finds himself a gladiator. In the same genre as Spartacus, this movie is far more spectacular...and I loved Spartacus. Despondent at the loss of his wife and child, Maximus (Crowe) has refused to fight as a gladiator and wants nothing more than to be reunited with his family. Of course, he does fight, and looks forward to revenge for his misfortune.Crowe plays the part of a loyal Roman general (of Spanish descent) very well. The king looks at Maximus as a son...and there is where the problems begin. Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus, the king's real son, who is nothing short of a spoiled brat. The fight scenes in the movie are spectacular, but the plot will satisfy even the ladies who go more for the romantic films.",Gladiator
932,MikeG-1221,"An excellent, albeit historically inaccurate, film.",8,26 August 2001,"A rousing story of one man surviving adversity and destroying a corrupt man in the process, Gladiator is a very entertaining 2 1/2 hour ride. The best part of the movie is the backdrop itself, for which Ridley Scott aggressively takes the moviegoer on a trip throughout all corners of the Roman Empire, and even to their concept of heaven in the process. Definitely worth the money, and I'm sorry that I didn't get to see it on the big screen.I was disturbed, however, by the historical liberties taken with the script. For those of you who don't care about this sort of thing, please stop reading now.OK, first of all, Marcus Aurelius died of the plague, which would have been pretty hard for Commodious to fake if he had killed his father. 2nd, Commodius lived for 12 years (180-192 A.D.) so his quick rise and fall doesn't really jibe historically either (he died in a wrestling match). Also, he was known for his physical strength, so his wimpiness in the movie really didn't make sense.These items, taken alone, bother me a little, but then there are more disturbing factors to take into account. For one, soldiers weren't allowed BY LAW to get married, so all of Maximus' talk of ""going home to see his wife"" really doesn't make sense. Soldiers did keep women on nearby plots of land, but they probably wouldn't talk openly about it. Also, Rome was in a defensive posture; most of the lands they had acquired they acquired BEFORE Marcus Aurelius came to power.I think what bothers me the most is the fact that Marcus Aurelius was no hero. He was renowned for persecuting Christians; he stepped up efforts during his regime, believing that Christianity would be the death of the empire. While he did do some very good things for the empire, he wasn't the benevolent patriarch that the movie made him out to be. He also tried to marry his nephew to his daughter so they would produce a ""super emperor""; my guess is that he probably didn't want Rome to be a Republic again.Revisionist history is troublesome. Although this did happen nearly 2 millennia ago, we still can't forget that the emperors of the day were not heroes by today's standards. I'm not one of those politically correct people who thinks that movies about despots shouldn't be made. I simply believe that historical figures should be presented honestly for what they did (and didn't do), and not sugarcoated for a mass audience.Having said all that, I really did like the movie. I give it an 8/10, with the disclaimer that it's no Braveheart, but it is visually stunning and hard to look away from while you're watching it, but not a movie that really will affect me for months after seeing it.",Gladiator
933,JoySLeigh,A Rare Profoundly impactive movie,10,20 March 2015,"Ever since Steven Speilburg (sp?), it has been rare to find a movie that achieves what ""Hollywood"" stood for back in Charlie Chaplin's day, then Jimmy Stewart, Bogie and Becall, etc.Gladiator isn't a gently-tugging-at-your-soul's attention kind of movie. It GRABS you from the very first, less than 5 minutes into the opening, and doesn't end until the movie is over. Even then, I recall wandering out of the theater, almost in a ""fugue"" state of mind. THAT'S how powerful was the movie's moral is, not to mention plot, character development, protagonist vs antagonist, all the way from the gripping start to the ending. Evil vs. Honor, the ""parable"" of the consequences of choosing to live the thrill of Exhilaration, achieved ONLY via the absorption of selfish greed and power, compared to the everlasting courage of a principled, moral, ethical, self-effacing life.Actually, Ridley Scott DID do another classic - Alien (the original.) But with Gladiator, Russell Crowe, and Joaquin Phoenix could not have been better chosen for the roles played.This was a movie on a scale beyond epic...hence, no chance of a sequel. You cannot exceed 1000% in movie calibers.",Gladiator

935,nbarlow,Padded out to make it feel more 'epic',7,21 March 2005,"Gladiator is a long film. Epic films are supposed to be long. But somehow Gladiator doesn't feel like an epic film. Sure, it deals with the rise and fall of a Roman Emperor, has spectacular battle scenes, a nearly spectacular CGI Colosseum, and everyone speaks in the clipped 'BBC English' accent that we all know they used in Roman times, but somehow the story doesn't carry enough weight.We feel bad for Maximus when he's betrayed, and we hate the villain and want him to get his comeuppance. But we don't give a toss about the Roman people, who are portrayed as a bloodthirsty mob, so why should we want them to be freed from their tyrannical emperor? It works better as a personal revenge tale than as a chapter in the history of the Roman Empire.The script is weighed down with pretentious and meaningless pronouncements (""Rome is an idea""?) and the plot is too full of coincidences. The action sequences are well executed (if you'll excuse the pun) and none of the actors embarrass themselves, but overall this is an above average film that has ideas above its station.",Gladiator
936,Epaminondas,Crowe can't save voyeuristic and incoherent film,5,24 January 2005,"Russell Crowe's fine performance as an ex-general turned into a slave and then a gladiator cannot save this picture from its utter absurdity, as the ending stages a pathetic duel between him and (no kidding) the Emperor of Rome in the Coliseum!!! There are some impressive scenes in the film, and Crowe has a beautiful screen presence; his friendship with a fellow Numidian gladiator is nicely conveyed, as is his attachment to amulets representing his family; the revelation of his identity is aptly charged with tension; and the preparation of the first battle is superb. Alas, it then turns into an orgy of gore.Being an ancient Greek (Theban to be precise) general, I'm bound to have qualms about this film's treatment of antiquity. As many reviewers have noted, the sole idea of a roman citizen (let alone a general) being turned into a slave is absurd, as is the trip from Germania to Spain during which Crowe seems to pass through some sort of rocky desert before entering the hills of Tuscany... How familiar is the filmmaker with the geography of Europe I wonder? Depictions of power relations in Rome are also quite laughable.But it is the voyeuristic stance and contemporary political relevance of the film which I find most disturbing. The despisal/fascination for the 'mob' which runs through the film has a distinctly fascist tinge. The violence is in some places unbearable, all the more so as it is gratuitous (the slaughter of Maximus' son)... My deep rejection and indeed contempt for the film really developed from listening to Ridley Scott's commentary on the DVD, in which he avows, among other depressing platitudes, that he would really have liked to live in Roman times, granted he was among the wealthy ruling classes... Probably in order to enjoy the spectacle of death and violence he in turn successfully inflicts on his twentieth-century teenage audience. The implications of such a fascination for slavery and violence are frightening, and make one want to watch SPARTACUS over and over again, as a reminder of the times in which Hollywood stood for humanist values, and not their despisal. It is also an opportunity to find where many seemingly novel ideas in GLADIATOR actually originate...All in all, despite how much we want to believe in Crowe, the film is far from the historical and psychological complexity (and visual clarity in battle scenes) of the much-underrated Alexander. Indeed, Crowe would have been perfect in the part, and would probably have had the guts to oppose to the wearing of Colin Farrell's ridiculous blonde wig!",Gladiator
937,radoii_87,A summer blockbuster with a novel twist...,8,6 February 2014,"Summer blockbusters are creatures of their own, aiming to cater to and exploit our lowest desires. Ridley perfectly understands this and consciously tries to redefine them when he gets a chance. Unlike many others, he knows what he is doing and approaches the matter with care instead of force. This works only because of him.We have a movie about a spectacle, in which we and the mob are one and the same. It's cynical as it bashes the industry and us, yet hopeful with its vision for the future. The visual style is novel and somewhat counterintuitive. Typically, one would expect huge cinematic battles, filled with bloodshed, as well as a very architecturally dimensional Rome, filled with pride of its history. Here, these are handed very differently, casually placed in the background. We imagine and deduce them from the eyes of the characters - very subtle, especially for a summer blockbuster. Instead, the focus here is on emotion and tension. Tension between a ""cheap entertainment thrill"" and ""strength and honor"". Judging by how successful this was, new endeavors should learn from it, as it shows that the audience expects something more. Crowe is utilized well here. Some of his scenes with Joaquin carry and project that tension for us to feed on.4/5 - Worth a watch. We've started to demand much more after this.",Gladiator
938,Fd-Up-Squirrel,One of the greatest films ever made.,9,3 March 2006,"From the actors, to the settings, to the cinematography, to the score, every step of the way through this amazing epic is a monument to what films should be. Hans Zimmer's emotionally driven score helps drive the story of Maximus (Crowe) through his glory as a General to his decent to a slave to his rise as a much loved Gladiator. The emperor is dying, and instead of giving the glory of Rome to his son (Joaquin Phoenix) he feels that Rome's light would be better carried by Maximus. But when the emperor tells his son, he kills his father, assumes the throne (since no one else had been told of the emperor's plan) and has Maximus' family slaughtered and his home burned, and even attempts to have Maximes killed off. Maximus escapes to his home and finds no reason to live, but is taken in as a slave and sold to be a Gladiator. With nothing to lose, and the vindication of his dead wife and son, Maximus defy's the Emporer and becomes more loved again, which only angers the new Ceaser even more, making him even more jealous.It's epic by all means, and is one of the greatest films in the history of films. Russel Crowe's performance is emotionally breathtaking from the delivery of his lines, to his ability to let emotion pour into his character like so few actors ever have. Gladiator is hardly unmatched in history, and will be hard to even come close to equaling in the future.",Gladiator

The story line itself is just simply awesome. Also who doesn't want to watch a movie with Russell Crowe and Ridley Scott as the director. They both made and starred in many acclaimed movies. This movie was made in 2000 and is still better than other movies out there! It really explains about the Roman Empire and the power they had as well as their weaknesses. It shows that and it also doesn't sway away from the main story. It doesn't just show a man for revenge, it goes deeper about his life and honor. His role as a general and the responsibilities with the surrounding people. The cinematography can't be explained...there is too many positive factors! You will never take your eye off the screen! There is always a climax in every scene and it just goes on and on! Get ready to be amazed!",Gladiator

Three Kings, The Insider and American Beauty all got close, but not since Saving Private Ryan, two years ago, has a movie recieved four stars from my critical perspective.  Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" is the real deal. Love, passion, action, emotion, and excitement put together one hell of a potpourri to make this the most unique and well-done movie of 2000, and will remain that way. The first time I saw it was opening weekend, and I was not as impressed then as I am now. The first time it was great, but I felt like I just witnessed a bad car accident. The brutality of this movie (Roman behavior and lifestyle) overshadowed my enjoyment of it. The second time, was much better, and the third which I just watched, was nothing short of amazing! Russell Crowe is a bigger bad-ass than William Wallace, and though this movie is not AS good as Braveheart, it is just as enjoyable and unforgettable! Hopefully in March, we'll see Scott and Crowe accepting Oscars for Best Picture/Best Actor-something that is most definitely deserved.",Gladiator

But it's ultimately a three-character movie (Maximus, Lucilla, and Commodfus)and none of those three characters are all that interesting. The ending should be devastating in terms of emotional content, but it just lacks the heart of earlier Roman epics like ""Spartacus"" and even ""Quo Vadis"".  And, despite the lavish computer-generated effects, the film is sorely missing an epic scope.  Contrast Commodus's arrival in Rome with Cleo's spectacular entrance in the '63 ""Cleopatra"".  Maybe the latter film wasn't all that great either, but it captured the scale and pagentry that ""Gladiator"" misses.",Gladiator
945,nasakcuf-3,Very atmospheric movie. Recommended!,8,26 June 2000,"This film has sort of an epic feel to it; the crowds, the sets, and the ambiance in general all work to effectively re-create life as it might have been in the Roman Empire.We begin with Maximus, a very successful Roman general, and Commodus, the incompetent heir apparent to the reigning Caesar, Marcus Arelius. Maximus, after winning a key battle against Germanic hordes, is offered what is essentially a wish by Arelius. Maximus is battle-weary and just wants to go home. While the aging Arelius initially agrees, he is in failing health and recognizes that Commodus isn't fit to rule, and therefore offers Maximus a ""protectorate of Rome"" position instead, which the reluctant Maximus takes under consideration. If he accepts, he effectively would be Caesar, something that wouldn't sit well with heir apparent Commodus...I thought this film was quite effective on many levels. Maximus was portrayed as a general following the orders of his Caesar, sometimes reluctantly but always to the best of his abilities. Commodus was portrayed as a cruel letch which, if memory serves, he was. And the Roman Senate, a hotbed of intrigue and corruption, served as a curious counterpoint to the concept of a Caesar, showing that not even the Caesars were perfectly free to do as they wished. All in all, a very watchable, atmospheric movie well worth the price of admission.",Gladiator

My only complaint is that Crowe's ""General Maximus"" comes off as a bit too much of an innocent for his lofty position as a commander of legions of men.  Crowe manages, in spite of this, to make you believe Maximus is a commanding man, a true leader.  Ridley Scott certainly cast the best man for the job.  Joaquin Phoenix made me emotionally squirm in my seat every time he came on the screen.  His depiction of the nearly sociopathic son of the Emperor is a role he is clearly well capable of playing.  Richard Harrison is always a delight to see, as is Oliver Reed.",Gladiator

But this was not what I expected. This is nothing else than your average Death Wish - one man goes for revenge flick, only difference is that it's set in the roman empire. Why do we have to see the same story over and over again? Where are new, fresh ideas? Yeah, you don't see a $ 100 million movie for intellectual advance, but this is Ridley Scott! Remarkable is the physical presence of Russell Crowe. Since his cool-as-hell performance in `The Quick and the Dead' he was the man for the important roles, and here he shows that he's able to carry a whole movie. A truly breathtaking performance, he's the man right now!Good action scenes and SFX, amazing sets and great acting are not enough to distract from the weak plot, but makes at least a typical popcorn movie, and isn't that what most movies are all about? 6/10",Gladiator

They're not the show, the Roman world, a very specific silly version of the Roman world is. Its a well-balanced movie, with nothing being especially good.Speaking of which, for a budget that big, the effects were pretty, but they clearly weren't that impressive. You can tell where they are, which is too bad. In a year with better movies (hardly a bold statement, and its not like they get much better), this wouldn't be considered for anything.

949,08131352022,'A masterpiece of its kind ',10,7 December 2004,"I have never been really interested in Roman Empire movies. Now I finally got around to completing my Russell Crowe DVD collection. So I also ordered the widescreen signature edition of the 'Gladiator', two disks (second disk with bonus material) from Amazon.com. I received the DVD last Tuesday. On Wednesday I watched it for the first time. On Thursday I watched the bonus material and part of the movie again. Now it's been a week and I have already watched it 3 times and I am already thinking about watching it again tonight. It's a masterpiece of its kind with one of the most magnificent photography and brilliant special effects I have ever seen. Russell Crowe as Maximus is absolutely perfect. He is the true hero such a movie needs. Though the rest of the cast is also well chosen and gives a great performance, Russell Crowe is the character this movie needed to become outstanding. With each viewing you will discover another interesting detail, another facial expression that wows. I also recommend watching the bonus material disk after the first viewing. It will give you an astonishing behind the scene look at how the movie was made and how real some scenes actually are. The documentary on Gladiator games provides an interesting insight into the whole subject. And don't miss the deleted scenes. They shouldn't have been cut out. The sound track especially the main theme is also overwhelming. One of my favorite scenes is where Russell Crowe rides the pirouette on the grey horse at the end of a fight.

From its battle-scene beginnings to its battle-scene endings, Gladiator is predictable. Ish. And that's where the excitement comes in. Each time a new part of the plot, which is largely transparent, is introduced, you find yourself altering your perceptions of the characters, the situation they're in, and the possible pathways for the movie to travel along. And Ridley Scott does a great job, feeding tidbits to the viewers as they go, so they learn a little more about Maximus and friends as the movie goes on. At 2½ hours, you'd want to be able to say the movie was engrossing. And it is. Looking back on it, I don't remember there being a great deal of dialogue. And it's not the Meet Joe Black kind of not much dialogue either. This dialogue is sparse because it can be - the story is *shown* to you, not told you. A very entertaining movie.

At one point in the movie, I took a glimpse at my watch and was elated to find out I had another hour and half to go...I can't fathom how someone could vote this movie a '1' out of '10', they must have expected a boring, tear jerker with bad acting because anyone that likes action films HAS to enjoy this movie.  Maybe not as much as me, but GLADIATOR doesn't rate a '1' in any aspect, especially not overall...

955,Greg Lord,A Star Is Born - and his name is Russell,10,25 May 2000,"Stunning, magnificent, overwhelming: Gladiator' is simply one of the best films ever made  go see it! End of review.What  still need convincing? Oh, OK then: English director Ridley Scott  already responsible for such masterpieces as Blade Runner', Alien' & Thelma & Louise' - has done it again. In a year that has already produced many great films, (e.g. The Talented Mr. Ripley', American Beauty', Galaxy Quest'), this in my opinion is the best film of the year; not only that but one of the best of all time  it's that good!Recreating the swords & sandals' genre, in the great tradition of Cecil B. DeMille, Spartacus' & Ben Hur', (which gets more than a passing nod in one of the many stunning set pieces), this like a lot of great movies has a plot that is simple but involving  a tale of wrongs done & attempted revenge, the heroic good guy battling against the odds to avenge himself on the evil ruler. In keeping it simple Scott is able to focus on what this film is all about  an action-packed epic, visually stunning & with outstanding performances from an outstanding cast.From the outset you know this is going to be something special. A Roman legion is in a dark, wet forest (actually in Surrey) preparing for a final battle to quell the last of the resistance of Germanic tribes to the advance of the mighty empire. The resulting battle is wonderfully atmospheric (the hooting' of the barbarians as they prepare to attack is particularly eerie) & it's recreation of the Roman war machine in full cry is awesome to behold. This is filmed on an enormous scale  the sets are breathtaking. Whereas in the past films such as this have had to rely solely on large real sets & a cast of thousands', Scott has added 21st-Century computer technology & shown us what really can be done with it. As a result the sheer HUGENESS of this movie is awe-inspiring. This is probably as perfect a recreation of ancient Rome as is currently possible, & the sets ooze historical accuracy, no doubt helped by being based on a true story. Conversely, the action sequences are handled superbly & with close-ups & cuts to interactions between the fighters you also feel you're right in there in the thick of it. Scott gets this balance just right, & the result is a film with some of the most stunning action sequences you will ever see, & lots of them. This is one of those movies where everything seems right'  Scott has once again achieved that rare feat of touching perfection. This is despite the slight inconvenience of Oliver Reed dying during filming & having to be partly replaced by technical wizardry, resulting in a partial rewrite! The cast are all excellent: Reed himself puts in one his best performances as a gladiator manager, & Richard Harris as the ailing Caesar, Joaquin Phoenix as his wonderfully depraved successor, & Connie Nielsen as his sister are all superb. A particularly inspired piece of casting, as a Senator, was Derek Jacobi  whose most famous role, & one of TV's great performances, was in the title role of the BBC's groundbreaking I, Claudius'.
The most praise of all however has to be reserved for the film's star, Russell Crowe, who plays the deposed General Maximus.  I realise that I'm not exactly impartial here as Crowe, like me, hails from little old New Zealand - but he is simply magnificent. He eats up the screen with his every appearance, & can be at once tender, terrifying, grief-stricken & commanding. In my opinion he deserves an Oscar. Anyone who's seen him before  particularly in the excellent & controversial Oz film Romper Stomper' - will already know what he's capable of, but he's here added an extra dimension to his already wide range of skills in that he is obviously a natural as an action hero. If he isn't already, I think he is set to become Hollywood's no. 1 action man, leaping into the void created by the advancing years of Schwarzeneggar, Stallone & Willis. And unlike Arnie & Sly, Crowe can also act! This is a near-perfect cinematic masterpiece: moving, visually stunning, superbly directed, with a great star turn & terrific support, & some of the best action sequences ever seen on film.

The plotline is very carefully studied and it parallels the real historical events that took place during the rule of Emperor Commodus. Only for the sake of historical truth I tell you several characters and events are fictitious but that doesn't make the movie any less breathtaking. I strongly recommend it.,Gladiator
957,JoshL007,Today I saw a film become more powerful than any other...,10,10 April 2001,"Critique: 8 out of 10Back in 1959, MGM released a film that critic's hailed and audiences adored. This film went on to win eleven academy awards, and instantly becoming a classic all around the world. This was director William Wyler's Ben-Hur. Nearly 40 years after that, comes an epic-like film, with a similar storyline, titled Gladiator. An entertaining, well-made movie, that brings back the treasures of yesterday.The plot, although original, is cleverly written by screenplay writer's, David Franzoni, John Logan, and William Nicholson. General Maximus (Russell Crowe) the greatest military leader Rome has ever had. After defeating, the Germanic renegades, Maximus is looking toward going home to his wife and son soon. Yet, the dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius wishes to give the throne over toward Maximus, instead of the rightful heir his reckless son, Commodus. Maximus isn't thrilled about the idea, and tells the Emperor he'll think about his decision. Though, before Maximus can give his answer, Commodus hears about this and kills his father out of anger. Commodus takes the throne immediately, and asks for Maximus support. When Maximus doesn't give it, Commodus is furious and orders to execute him and his family. While Maximus barley escapes, he family doesn't. Wounded emotionally and physically, Maximus passes out, only to be captured by slave traders. Purchased by a former Gladiator, Proximus (Oliver Reed), Maximus finds himself competing in small gladiator contests. As Maximus becomes more popular, he discovers he may be able to take revenge on the man who killed his family.Director Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner"", ""Hannibal"") brings to the screen, some enormous cinematography, making you feel as if you were right there among the characters. The Gladiator fight scenes are brought to life, from clever camera angles, and the frequent shaking of the camera.
Russell Crowe (""Proof of Life"", ""The Insider"") performs wonderfully, and brings to life his character's emotions. Joaquin Phoenix, plays the corrupt young Emperor well, and delivers a believable performance being crude, selfish, and full of hate against Maximus. Supporting Actress Connie Neilson, (""Mission to Mars,"" ""Soldier"") plays the emperors sister, and Maximus former love interest (something that should have been discussed a bit more). Oliver Reed, does a fantastic job as Proximo, the retired Gladiator, who's quest is to help Maximus win his freedom.Violence. This movie is filled with it, from a man being sliced in half, from decapitation's. While, I wouldn't have made the film this gory, it does make for a completely realistic feel! This film is a wonderful, it has a few flaws, but besides them it has become an instant classic around the world. Though, not everyone will enjoy this film as much as I did, it's worth seeing. I give it: 8 out of 10.",Gladiator
958,Everwas,A quality action-film-done-right with emotion and beauty,8,13 May 2000,"A truly incredible film, ""Gladiator"" is epic in nature with an interesting plot, strong emotion, beautiful imagery, and fierce action that held me on the edge of my seat until the final credits fell.  Due to the human struggles of the plot and the identifiable characters, I became empathetic and emotional, truly ""pulling"" for what I wanted to happen (as was intended, I'm sure).  The battle scenes were highly engaging and interesting to watch--not just the same old fights.  The beautiful locations and imagery really added a great visual layer to the film that enhances its entertainment value, its enjoyability.  A couple scenes have aspects that are unrealistic, and the special effects were sometimes pixelated and unrealistic, but I appreciate all that ""Gladiator"" accomplishes and recommend it highly to anyone in the mood for a -quality- action film.",Gladiator
959,handyman-3,Only One Minor Flaw,10,4 June 2000,"There is only one flaw in Gladiator and that is that the cinematography frequently takes attention away from what is happening instead of staying decently, and professionally, out of the way of how the action/story is proceeding.  There was a time that the camera spun around with no real reason to do so.  It might also be said that the choice of color and/or exposure is sometimes intrusive also because it is too unnatural.  There are some areas of the story where it would be ""natural"" as in the Elysian Fields or in the candlelite tent of Caesar.  But none of this is too intrusive, it's just that in a masterpiece it is the only intrusive element.  Maybe it can be fixed up in later editions.",Gladiator
960,etherealtb,An Unique Opportunity for a Great Actor,9,29 May 2000,"This is one of the best movies in recent memory.  Not because it is ""perfect"" film by any means; it definitely has it's flaws.  But it is worth the price of admission if only to see superb actors such as Russell Crowe, Jouquin Phoenix, Richard Harris, Oliver Reed, Derick Jacobi, etc. strut their stuff.While many people who have been Russell Crowe fans for years will resent the fact that many are touting ""Gladiator"" as Russell Crowe's ""breakthrough"" role, fans long ago noticed there was something unique about this guy in such film as ""Proof"", ""The Sum of Us"", ""Quick and the Dead"", ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Insider"".But in spite of the films flaws, Crowe fans will not be disappointed in ""Gladiator"" because they get a chance to see him carry the entire weight of a big budget film (he's in practically every scene) on his ample shoulders. As with Vivien Leigh in ""Gone With the Wind"", it is hard to imagine this film working without the presence of Russell Crowe.He makes the most believable gladiator I have ever seen on film.  I'm sorry, but as much as I loved ""Sparticus"", I never believed Kirk Douglas could be a real gladiator.  He looked more like a gymnist; I never believed he could survive in the Coliseum.But as good as the other actors in ""Gladiator"" are, and as good as the effects and fight sequences are, the plot and script could not have been as compelling with any other actor but Russell Crowe playing Maximus.
There is some unique quality about this guy (perhaps the strange mixture of violence and compassion in his face) that brings an absolutely unique contribution to this film.  His acting covers the gaps in the script....mostly done with his facial and body expressions since he is rarely given quality lines to say. (Most of the lines in the film are a bit corny or cliched.  It's a good thing they had this brilliant cast!)For example, we are expected to believe that this man, Maximus, who is capable of the most excruciating violence, is at heart a tender hearted family man who simply wants to go home to his farm.  It is left up to Mr. Crowe to make us believe this, and he rises to the occasion in spades.Someone pointed out to me that Crowe does not speak one word of dialogue from the time that Maximus is sent out to be executed by Commodus to the time he is in the gladiator ring shouting, ""Are you not entertained?""  The fact that, throughout this long sequence (20-30 minutes) I never even noticed Maximus never spoke, is just proof of the unique abilities of Russell Crowe as an actor. This is one guy who could have easily been a silent movie star; something that can't be said for 95% of the actors around today.As ""Gone With the Wind"" would have been just a so-so well made movie with nice production values without the presence of Vivien Leigh, so too would ""Gladiator"" have only been a so-so movie without the presence of Russell Crowe.  But because of him, it becomes a symbol of brave people everywhere fighting everywhere against unbelievable odds.  Let us hope, as with Vivien Leigh, that the Academy recognizes this unique talent and gives Mr. Crowe his best actor Oscar!",Gladiator
961,pheidias,I knew Spartacus...you're no Spartacus,5,30 May 2000,"This is a good-looking movie. Let's get that out of the way.  The character actors are very good (including Derek Jacobi, thrown in perhaps for associations with ""I, Claudius""?).  Crowe is good enough, although he isn't given a lot to work with, meaning he doesn't have very interesting lines. The Hans Zimmer score is predictably derivative: Holst, Orff and now Dead Can Dance -- things that go thump-thump-ahh-ahh.  But the ""atmospheric"" style seems to be in vogue at the moment.  It really interfered with my enjoyment, though.  The historical accuracy was wildly varied: pedantic details of the manmade environment peeked out from wholly unrealistic scenes.  You can hire consultants to reproduce period textiles, but not period sensibilities.  The writer and director have to find those in reading some of the plentiful sources that have come down to us from Rome.  I wonder how much time they devoted to hearing the voices of ancient Romans before staging their big computer crowd scenes.  Spartacus took up some serious issues, even though it was quite corny.  This is just a revenge tale with exquisite production values. 6/10",Gladiator
962,Jace007,Fall Of The Roman Empire?,9,25 February 2001,"Gladiator is a film worth watching. But as I was watching the film, I suddenly felt like I've seen this movie before and my appreciation for it started to lower. Wasn't until the final scenes that it clicked. I was sure this movie was a remake of The Fall Of The Roman Empire. Gladiator had similarities to this 1964 movie starring Sophia Loren, Boyd and Christopher Plummer as the over the top Emperor. I found this movie a bit corny and it sort have had negatively influenced my judgement over Gladiator.Todays action movies you mainly see guns and explosions, but when a movie like Gladiator comes out it should be fresh, new and entertaining. I found the movie entertaining and fresh - but it wasn't a new storyline. But putting everything else aside, movies are there for enjoyment and entertainment. As long as a movie has these ingredients it can't possibly go wrong. Gladiator is one of these movies that has the ingredients. A great movie, but if you want to see a better gladiator movie, I would recommend Spartacus.",Gladiator

All kidding aside, it was a disturbingly accurate picture of the Roman Empire during that period in history.  The blood lust of the mob can certainly be compared to modern-day sporting events.  Professional wrestling comes to mind, among other things. While not a perfect picture, neither was anything else this year.  Even though ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" and ""Traffic"" were probably better movies, ""Gladiator"" has more feel-good crowd appeal.  I do believe that Russell Crowe deserved his Best Actor Oscar, and his supporting cast did a superb job as well.  Plush sets, great costumes, and incredible computer graphics.",Gladiator

967,keenenpieter,Gladiator,9,16 July 2002,"I bought the video of 'Gladiator' for my dad's birthday. He loved it, my brother loved it, my mother loved it, my Latin teacher loved it, everyone else I know loved it, and of course I loved it too. But I wanted to see it in the cinema, because it's more powerful there. A friend of mine once told me the end of the film, that wasn't very nice, but still I wanted to see it and I'm glad I did. I like movies about ancient Rome, even when I was a kid, this is after Ben-Hur my favorite one.The story is simple, but it's very strong and effective shown to the audience. A Roman general, called Maximus (Russell Crowe) is betrayed, and he's forced to go into slavery, as a gladiator he tries to survive, and after many victories, he goes back to Rome in the Colosseum, where he wants to take revenge on the corrupted emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).This movie has an excellent cast, Russell Crowe as the hero, Joaquin Phoenix as the corrupted emperor, Richard Harris as the TRUE emperor, Connie Nielsen as the sister of Commodus, and Oliver Reed as the former gladiator who teaches Maximus how to be a magnificent gladiator. Pity that it was his last performance. (Oliver, we'll miss you.)The performances were terrific, especially from Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, but the others were terrific too. As for the Oscars, there are people who say it's been overrated, I think it's a bit underrated, even though it won 5 Oscars. I was disappointed that Joaquin Phoenix and Ridley Scott didn't get an Oscar for this, because they both really surprised me. However I was glad that it won an Oscar for Best Picture and Russell Crowe for Best Actor, I wasn't surprised about that because Russell really showed what a true hero is. Ridley Scott did an excellent job with this movie. I'm really impressed. The special effects are outstanding, and they don't subordinate the performances of the actors. Ridley brings us in the heart of Rome, and inside the walls of the Colosseum, where the battles are organized. These battle scenes are really great and exciting to see. But the best thing Ridley Scott did, was to give us a clew how it was in the ancient Rome, I mean, those things REALLY happened back then, and Rome loved this: the blood, the gore, the fights, etc. Ridley Scott made these images very realistic, in a way it's beautiful made, even though it's extremely violent and brutal. But behind all the violence and the blood, there's a striking story of a man, who becomes the poorest man, but after a while he becomes a hero and he puts Rome back on its feet. Ridley also describes the politics and the corruption in Rome, those things also were well known in the ancient Rome.I really enjoyed this movie, and after all those years it's fun to see another Roman epic. I recommend this movie to everyone, my advice, BUY it, don't RENT it, and get ready for a big pile of action. The Roman epic is back again.",Gladiator
968,Shevy1103,History has been written...,9,20 March 2013,"I do not have the words to describe how brilliant this movie is, Yet, I'll try to find some.The quality of this film is off the hook! And the action scenes are incredibly nice, bloody, but nice. For example Maximus first battle in the arena. The choreography of that was explicit. The war at the very beginning; also great, but every scene in this movie was great in their own way, so.It's the classic good meets evil, slave meets emperor, right meets wrong, all these classic and endless feuds have all come together in this movie, in a fight, a fight that will not stop until there is but one left standing.David Franzoni wrote the story and David Franzoni wrote the screenplay, and he did an indescribable, magnificent job doing that. You don't believe me? Ask the 5 Oscars, 45 other awards and 79 other award nominations this movie got.This movie is (believe it or not) based on emotions. In fact all movies are. Take away the emotions and what have you got left? Nothing! What is a fight in the arena without rage? What is a relationship without love? What is a good day without happiness? What is the point of righteousness if there is no wrong in the world? You get my point.In this world, there are no words, no words at all that can do the acting in this movie or the movie itself any justice.Before I sat down to write this review I did a search for gladiator to find out the last name of the writer, and I stumbled upon this: ""This movie teaches us a crucial lesson about power. Power is one of those elusive qualities that we all aspire to have. We seek it through money, through education, through politics, and through our social ties. When we think of the Roman Empire, we think of ""power."" The Roman Empire ruled over the Old World for hundreds of years. There were other individuals and nations that managed to conquer much of the world: Alexander the Great is the most famous, and Napoleon wreaked some havoc in his time. But since the fall of the Roman Empire, that level of sheer power has not been matched."" Everything with this movie is awesome. The acting, the lighting, staging, music, everything. I can actually not think of one single thing with this movie that is less than awesome. True story.Well, I am guessing you have probably figured this out already, but this was a good movie. So, good that I am giving it 9 stars. Yup, 9 out of 10 stars from me, and If you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend you to do so.Howdy ho and a bottle of rum! Buenos Noches mis lectores. Good night and see you later! Shevy",Gladiator
969,ajsb55,Gladiator,8,12 October 2008,This was a great movie although it did take me three times to think that. The first time I saw it I was disappointed because I had expected a much better movie. The second time I saw it right after I had seen A beautiful mind and walk the line so I really enjoyed the acting in this movie by Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe. The third time I saw this movie I thought it was just amazing and everything that happened during the movie was great. The music by Hans Zimmer is fantastic though it does resemble to the Pirates of the Caribbean music a little bit. The costumes and the special effects and the color in this movie was just fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix should have won the Oscar for his role. Crowe rightfully deserved his win.,Gladiator
970,Arthur_Desmond,A phenomenal disappointment,4,30 September 2006,"At the time of its release, ""Gladiator"" promised far more than it delivered; part of the audience still had some hope ""G.I. Jane"" and ""White squall"" were the exception to Scott's career (other ""exceptions"" such as ""Thelma & Louise"" and ""Black rain"" were too far behind to be remembered) and Crowe had recently hit the big screen with ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The insider"", making us believe he was indeed a versatile actor.But when the moment of truth came, it all came down to a formulaic, even boring revisiting of ""peplum"" with a penchant for vengeance and codes of honor, some sort of Spaghetti Western on sandals. Worst of all, it is extremely inaccurate in its depiction of Ancient Rome, and there is something in its inaccuracy that makes me think it was intentional; for instance, the only main character with a Mediterranean phenotype is Joaquin Phoenix, albeit the rest of the main cast (Crowe, Harris, Nielsen, Jacobi, Reed, ...), although apparently Roman patricians and ""equites"", would be far more adequate playing Celts or Germans. And moreover, the true Germans were shown for a couple of minutes as furtive, dirty, easily disposable barbarian thugs who hid behind the trees making guttural noises and looked anything but Nordic. Furthermore, a grandiloquence is attributed to Roman architecture, urbanism and daily life which is highly unlikely to be even similar to the real Rome of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus. Even some of the weapons shown at the beginning of the film are extremely unlikely to have existed. In other words: this is not a reconstruction of Rome, but a projection, a deformed mirror from which a certain country of our days looks at itself. This happens to a certain point in ""Alexander"", too, and makes me think the current vogue of historical cinema is more directed at redefining the position of the United States as a summit of ""enlightened power"" in the midst of an uncivilized world than at maintaining accuracy and resemblance to the true facts.The truth is Ridley Scott has only given us two good movies in all his career: ""Alien"" and ""Blade runner"". The rest of his work could have been directed by Spielberg, Cameron or even his own brother. Instead of wondering why his filmography is so mediocre nowadays, we should wonder how could he direct those two masterpieces. Maybe the essence of artistic excellence is heavily dependent on having the right collaborators rather than on personal genius, especially since the latter is not so frequent, after all. This would explain, for example, why Schoedsack and Cooper delivered one piece of Art in 1933 and never came even close to doing it again.",Gladiator
971,oli_rawlings,consistently indescribably superb,10,28 October 2005,"Their are no words to describe this grand historic epic. Gladiator is a film everybody would enjoy, for it has a great story, great action and superb acting (no wonder Crowe got an Oscar!) Gladiator recounts the story of one of the greatest Roman generals Maximus, who was forced to slavery by the corrupt incestuous heir to the throne Commodus (Phoenix) who killed Marcus Aurelius the emperor for he knew he offered Maximus power over his own son. Maximus has then become his worst enemy. Commodus having ordered to kill him and his family, Maximus escapes death and as becomes the general who became a slave, the slave who became gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor. Gladiator has some of the most beautiful scenery and CGI effects I have ever seen. IT really is one of the best ""recent"" films out there. The script is also very effective and suiting, and somehow adds a poetic feel to it and so does the superb music used. The actors all did very well in their roles, though Crowe dominated, it is also a memorable performance by Phoenix and Nielsen most memorably and also Hounsou and Harris.

978,Hitchcock-3,The Fall of Rome (in movies),4,16 May 2000,"Too bad...I was hoping for a revival of Roman Gladiator Greats.     Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" is not all that it's cracked up to be. Although most of the action sequences are astounding, the dialogue is so awful that each time a character says something it sounds like nails on a chalkboard.  How many times did someone say ""I will have my vengance!""?  5 times, by my count.  Gladiator has lots of scenes devoted to character depth, but no real person would talk in as many cliches as these people do.     Another Gripe: The movie is much longer than it needs to be.  If the last hour (of its 155 minute running time) was to be cut off, absolutely none of the plot would change!  The plot is supposed to thicken in the last hour, but that never happens because every interesting scenes which surfaces is shot down by cheesy dialogue; every scene which starts promisingly falls flat on its face.  I suggest cutting out 50 of the last 60 minutes and putting the ending in sooner.     A few highlights: The fighting scenes in the ring truly are amazingly staged, if over-gory, and the opening battle is a delight.  Finally, Russell Crowe does try hard to rise above the script, and his performance would have been memorable if he had some actual material to explore.     I say ""Gladiator"" is only for those of you with three hours and eight bucks to burn.  Otherwise, go rent Ben-Hur, even though you need four (well-spent) hours for that one. Grade: C-",Gladiator
979,Fieracha,An amazing journey,10,12 May 2000,"I have seen near-perfection, and it is ""Gladiator"".Others have said more eloquently what I could here, so I will not go into any detail. In summary:Russel Crowe:  The 'rising star' who deserved a little gold statue for ""The Insider"" had better nab one for this role. Maximus is a typical soldier - powerful presence, quiet confidence, emotional yet controlled (especially when Commodus tells him his son ""squealed like a girl"") and ultimately, dignified in victory.Oliver Reed: A classic as always. We will miss his screen presence. The CGI used to recreate his face for some scenes is faultless.Joaquin Pheonix: Develops a character we can really learn to hate. Others have said there was not enough screen time for Commodus, but I thought there was nearly too much! Connie Neilson: Suitably whimsical as a princess in the beginning, we see her develop into a strong mother figure, discarding all for her son's safetyFight scenes: Not the best I've seen, but they would have to come close. The first battle against the Germanian horde contrasts sharply with the gladiatorial arena. The skip frame effect serves to enhance the confusion of real battle, while the slower, more elegant shots of the arena display the game of death fought between essentially large men wearing silly hats. :)Costume, Sets, Design: Faultless - there are more gold statues up for grabs here.CGI for scenery: At points it was just a tiny bit fake (especially when they put birds into the frame), but overall the effect was superb.Some people have criticised the film for not being historically accurate, but what is it you people want? Truly there is no way to satisfy some of you, and you've lost the ability to just enjoy a movie for what it is. If you want to see history, watch a documentary.Personally, I shall be very interested to watch the Oscars next year and see if, once again, a movie gets snubbed because one of Hollywood's darlings isn't at the helm. We know Australian actors can grab the gold (Geoffrey Rush for ""Shine""), but how long before we get another?10 out of 10, but it was worth at least 12...",Gladiator
980,sunface,Comparisons to Spartacus are unavoidable,8,10 May 2000,"When I first heard about Gladiator I immediately thought of Spartacus. Would it be a remake?  Would it be anything like it?  It might be interesting to compare the two for a moment.On the surface there are many similarities between Gladiator and Spartacus: a slave-gladiator hero, an eccentric but likeable gladiator owner, Senator Gracchus scheming for power, a power-hungry sexually-muddled villain, and a female lead with mixed allegiance.  I think Russell Crowe gives us a better hero than Kirk Douglas (forgive me Mum), and also gives a better performance; in fact, Russell Crowe might be the best actor of his generation and is magnificent in this film.  Oliver Reed's Proximo cannot match up to Peter Ustinov's masterful portrayal of Batiatus.  Derek Jacobi is strong as Gracchus and compares well to Charles Laughton.  As a villain, Joaquin Phoenix is certainly no match for Laurence Olivier.  And in outwardly dissimilar roles, Connie Nielsen is actually a better female lead than was Jean Simmons (I should be shot for saying that).Both movies have strong battle scenes, but Gladiator has more of them (presumably to please today's average movie-goer) which means that screen-time for political wheeling and dealing is sacrificed - the affairs of the Senate were some of my favourite moments in Spartacus.  However, the numerous Coliseum battle scenes in Gladiator gave Russell Crowe more opportunity to build as a hero - and were some of the best scenes in the movie.The victory won in Spartacus is a personal one.  Whereas in Gladiator Maximus' victory is for the people of Rome.  And that is where the two films become very different.  The theme of Gladiator is that Rome was inherently good and that the corruption of the Senate and the tyranny of the Emperor were the evil forces - once you defeat the tyranny and corruption, Rome becomes great once more.  The theme of Spartacus is that Rome was inherently bad and regardless of who was in power, slaves would always be slaves and had to fight for their personal freedom and for justice.Overall, I liked Gladiator very much.  I'm not sure it is as good as Spartacus - only time will tell us that - but I think I liked it as much as Spartacus.",Gladiator

The direction,effects and action sequences were at time mind blowing.Russell Crowe plays the lead with refreshing understatement and reminded me of Richard Burton at his very best.The story is very very loosely based on the last days of the Roman Empire but allowing for some poetic license we were transported to a time when life was cheap and the contentment of the mob was paramount.The film even had moments of humour especially from Commodus the errant son of the Marcus Aurelius but it was his evil which was superbly portrayed by Joachin Phoenix.This probably wont win the best film at next years oscars, due to it not being about life in modern America but i doubt i'll see a better film this year.",Gladiator

Mr. Scott has finally goven up trying to imitate his brother, Tony, and returned to more traditional story telling (forget G.I. Jane). The story is compelling, with real meat to it (some of it cleaved!).There is absolutely nothing wrong with this film. Even the minor historical inaccuracies work (stirrups on the horses, for example). The supporting cast are all given wonderfully realized characters to play. Watch for Oliver Reed to get a posthumous Oscar nomination next spring. Production design,a fantastic score, photography- it's a real repeater. Which is why I've seen it four times so far, with more viewings to come.
Congratulations, Mr. Scott.",Gladiator
984,spyder7,You have to see it.,10,28 November 2000,"The best estimate I can get is that about 2% of people disliked this movie for some stupid reason.  As you can see by the barrage of praises, Gladiator is a superb movie, I think it has a very legitimate shot at Picture of the Year.  If people can't acknowledge that, I think they are very short sighted.  I noticed that the biggest criticism received is that this movie has an very unoriginal storyline.  Well, in that case most love story movies, cop shows, natural disaster films, and science fiction films are horrible too.  Give me a break, ideas are made to be built on, this movie does a spectacular job of a Gladiator story.  Just see it, it's worth it.",Gladiator
985,CKDexter-4,Ridley Scott loses against the Computer,4,18 July 2000,"As a former comment stated, the first twenty minutes of GLADIATOR are unique in the historic genre. The adversities of the winter in Germania's hinterland and its barbarous inhabitants are displayed very realistically. This breathtaking effort will not be surpassed for decades to come. But afterwards??? It seems like Ridley Scott's work was done. The computer took over - a big mistake. Digital Rome, digital Forum, digital Colosseum, even digital people - so obvious, that the film becomes more and more similar to an ""Asterix""-Cartoon. The plot... well, what plot?? It disappeared somewhere between two fighting scenes. And another very disturbing thing about GLADIATOR is, that every single line is spoken in such an over-significant way, that it could be as well the final line of the movie. Every time I thought: ""No line can outdo this superb quotation"". But it goes on and on and on... There's more to a good movie than exceptional fighting-sequences.",Gladiator

I think it was a good enough movie, entertaining and all that, but there was too much emphasis on the special effects instead of the actual story, which wasn't great to begin with.  I was not impressed with any of the acting abilities but it was entertaining. I guess maybe it shows that I'm not a huge Crowe fan.

Give me a break.  I was extremely disappointed, especially in the end.  It was very predictable and not satisfying. Russell Crowe was alright.  Connie Nielson was nothing special.  Joaquin Phoenix wasn't that bad.  Derek Jacobi gave one (of two) good performance.  Djimon Hounsou was also pretty good. I think I enjoyed the popcorn more than anything else....",Gladiator

989,Without Remorse,All praise,10,3 December 2000,"One must sit back and think a bit after seeing this particular flick of Russell crowe's. what's the question?: ""how lucky can u get?"" I've been watching Mr. Crowe since he has been on the movie scene and he has always managed to catch my eye in whatever he has been starring...one thing that really helps him is his manly dark voice. It gives him an aura of being in command and that he knows what he's saying & doing.Joaquin plays the evil-doer excellently in this film.His crying was quite believable.He wants what all children want of their fathers but he never gets it..well, at least,not in the way he wanted it. All round applause for all the artistes BUT Russell crowe just does it toooooooo nicely. What a performance!! The dialogues are sooooooooo great & original. when he takes off his mask & reveals himself..that long speech he gives in a definitely sexy tone should be etched in gold. .... ""... i will have my vengeance, in this life or the next."" ...that must have scared Commodus out of his skirt alright.Mr. Crowe's best movie yet...Ridley scott does a perfect job..standing ovation for him. Truly deserving a 10/10.",Gladiator
990,shoktart,Edge of Your Seat Fun!,10,19 February 2001,"Great Story!  Great Writing!  Great Acting!  Great Directing!  Great Score! This movie has it all.  I especially enjoyed the mood of the film.  Even though it has a lot of action, there is a subtle elegance throughout the picture that gives it great style.  The movie flows effortlessly from scene to scene, while at the same time creating wonderful intensity and nail-biting excitement.The acting in the movie more than lives up to expectations.  Russell Crowe is brilliant in his role as Maximus, the ""general who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor.""  Crowe's intense style is perfect for the relentless determination and confidence of Maximus.  Joaquin Phoenix is equally wonderful in his role as Commodus, the corrupt emperor. He plays a great villain because he is able to give Commodus depth by showing certain vulnerable or fragile sides, while at the same time instantly transforming to let the ruthless nature of his volatile character shine.  It also helps that Joaquin has the classic Caesar look that works perfectly with his role.Connie Nielsen is also very good as Lucilla.  However, perhaps the two finest performances in the movie were given by a couple of acting veterans in supporting roles.  Richard Harris and Oliver Reed were exceptional in what will be remembered as crowning achievements at the end of their careers.  Harris was perfect as Marcus Aurelius, the aging Caesar who reflects upon his life and contemplates how the world will remember him. And Reed, especially, gave my personal favorite performance in the movie as Proximo, the trainer for the gladiators.  The way he spoke about the life of a gladiator, the splendor of Rome, and the ""thrill of the Coliseum"" really added excitement and anticipation during the viewing of the movie.Gladiator is filled with many memorable moments that one would need to see more than once to fully appreciate.  The excitement felt for me when Rome is first shown in all its wonder and marvel is my favorite scene.  But the whole movie is a rush!  Hans Zimmer provides the absolute perfect score to capture the different moods in the movie.  Ridley Scott sets the perfect tone with his artistic and creative directing.  I would recommend it to anyone who can stomach intensity and enjoy an epic story for the ages.  Next to Braveheart, this movie is the greatest of all-time!",Gladiator

The Rome which he recreated in the movie is more beautiful than my imagination. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix gave powerful performances and I don't think any other actor can do better job than Joaquin Phoenix as a Commodus.However, there are some big historical mistakes in the movie. In history of the Roman Empire, Emperors never fights with the gladiators. But it is acceptable because this is a big budget Hollywood movie and it needs a powerful ending. Finally, Gladiator is good film and Scott makes another great job, stylish camera techniques, good storytelling, amazing atmosphere and visual effectiveness of colors are the proofs of his artistic vision.",Gladiator
994,jiefengf,"Came for Crowe, Leave with Phoenix",8,2 September 2020,"A classic movie successfully portrays a set of intensive characters in a relatively simple plot. The macho and valiant hero Maximus played by Crowe a man worshiped by his people. The beautiful and resourceful Lucilla by Nielsen a loving mother and the true continuation of the spirit of her father. And the envious and serpentine Commodus by Phoenix. The delicious portrayal of these characters creates a classical but still rich dynamics that for me is the main dish of this movie.In addition to this classicality of the plot and the characters, I appreciate the slightly heavy stroke on Commodus. This leads us to explore the natural question of what this man of jealousy is thinking. It's a man who yearns for respect and love of his father and his sister, all of which the mighty general has taken away from him. He seeks no power or fortune, but the name, which the enslaved Maximus claims so easily. This extra colour on the character of Commodus is like the shadow of the painting. A minor change, a huge enhancement.The story is complete. As I am not very knowledgable about neither the history of Rome nor the book, for me, the plot is still able to create a noticeable and constant tension that keeps me intrigued till the end. The ending is actually a little surprising, as I expected a realistic ending of tragedy. This ending, while emotionally pleasing, is a bit cliche. But then, the revelation of such ending reminds me that the move is about a poetic story. I don't feel this clicheness deal much damage to my experience to it.The friends Maximus make when enslaved as gladiator are not completely great. I cannot make a clear point on it. But I feel some of the strokes on these characters are not aesthetic enough and their purpose seems too obvious. This breaks the fluency and the naturalness of the story development. These characters should not bear so much personal emotions with Maximus.All in all, a great entertainment. An epic with strong characters. A story simple and beautiful. Flaws are not unnoticeable, but forgivable.",Gladiator

996,crowboy181,What a name for a movie. When I first saw the tv previews I knew it took place in Roman Times.,8,13 January 2002,Gladiator was a decite movie to go see and it had a twist to it at the end. The special features were incrediable.  For best picture of the year it ran very close to Erin Brokvich.  I like the part when the lion comes out of the trap off the ground and nearly bites him.  Whats interesting about the movie is that he gets past the biggest obstacles and finally everybody gets their freedom.  Nuff said,Gladiator
997,Star_Red,Overrated movie about fight techniques (minor spoilers),6,4 July 2002,"I had the feeling that Gladiator uses its plot primarily to show brutal gladiator fights. It has certainly an intriguing plot, which depicts a Roman general's revenge for betrayal, his family's slaughter, and his Emperor's murder, but there were too many fight and battle scenes for my liking. Still, it is an entertaining film that shows not only the shiny grandeur, but also the bloody, ugly cruelties of the Roman Empire, although some scenes, such as the bird-view look of the Colosseum, or the city landscape in the background when Commodus and Lucilla are standing on the balcony alone and talking, looked too CGI. What I had the most problems with was the final arena fight: We know that Commodus is so hungry for acceptance by his people and popularity, that it is unlikely that he would dare to kill Maximus in front of the watching crowd. And although this is a fictional story, it's unimaginable historically, that an Emperor would fight against a gladiator in the arena. As for the acting, Russell Crowe was very good and well suited for this role, but most of the other actors were only mediocre, especially Joaquin Phoenix, who overacted too often.I think the Oscar for Best Film was way too exaggerated; maybe it received it because there hasn't been a film about ancient Rome for a long time.",Gladiator

The swarthy, sexy, manly Maximus...has there ever been a more charismatic character on screen? Maximus is the kind of man that you would follow to the end of the earth. The personal journey that he goes through, from proud general to defeated slave to celebrity gladiator, is extremely moving...and the film's strong spiritual subtext made me extremely emotional.

1003,fadedGlory,Pointless gorefest,2,7 February 2005,"What we have here is a mixture of Ben Hur and Braveheart, and unsurprisingly it sucks.The main objective of the film seems to be to cram as much gore as possible in the space of a single movie, without bothering about trivialities like story, character or meaning. If it purports to show the beastliness of staged human fights to the death it utterly fails because it only lowers the viewers to the same voyeuristic level as the Romans themselves.Who cares about Maximus, a cardboard character with revenge as his only motivation? What to make of the crazy editing in the fight scenes that makes it impossible to understand what is going on? What with the bizarre geography and time lines? How to make sense of the opening battle which is claimed to be about a German settlement, yet takes place in the open and shows cavalry charging through a dense forest? Why the fake poetry of the hand in the wheat field? Who cares? Gore, gore and more gore, that is what sells tickets and, incredibly, delivers Oscars.The only thing I could appreciate, contrary to many others here, is Joaquin Phoenix' portrayal of Commodus as he descends from mere creepiness into downright raving lunacy. Nice bit of acting. All the rest is a waste of perfectly good celluloid.",Gladiator
1004,jack-davy,Not Living Up To The Hype,5,11 May 2016,"The film doesn't truly 'take off' until exactly 50 minutes in. The 'big battle' scene which kicks off the film should have got my pulse racing. Instead, it left me wondering why I bothered to watch.The magnificent Colosseum doesn't get a look in until 1 hour and 20 Minutes and even then the graphics are very fake looking (even for the year 2000) and there is not enough shots to showcase the size of the historic amphitheatre. The first battle scene in the Colosseum takes place shortly after this 1 hour and 20 mark, and at last - it's good viewing. Joaquin Phoenix plays the stereotypical spoilt brat Emperor with Daddy issues and having seen him in countless other films, it's fair to say his acting at it's height in this film.It's now 16 years old, so I will forgive the cheap looking Colosseum shots, but with 1997's Titanic being 20 years old next year - it still stands a lot stronger than 'Gladiator'.What annoys me is how highly rated this film is, as well as the hype and numerous accolades. I can only put it down to the fact that this film re-ignited interest in the Roman Empire and it was most certainly a good-looking film to kick off the Millennium. Sadly, it's not for me.",Gladiator

1009,Jenny-83,Gladiator - a 'chick flick' that appeals to everyone.,9,17 May 2000,"A lot of people use the term ""chick flick"" to describe any movie with emotion, implying most guys couldn't stand a movie with deeper meaning than just people blowing each other up. If that were true, Gladiator would be classified as a chick flick, but the guys I know who have seen this movie have loved it. And I love it, too.It's filled with star-making performances, especially in the three leads - Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen. Phoenix and especially Crowe did an exceptionally good job, I thought. Maybe this is just because, as a big fan of the ""sword and sandal"" films of days gone by, I wanted to see some young hotties get into togas and armor. But I think I would have enjoyed this film even without these two very attractive actors as the leads.Gladiator is over two hours long, but I never could tell. The story of Maximus (Crowe) and his quest for revenge against Commodus (Phoenix) is so engrossing I never once looked at my watch. The set and costume design, as well as special effects, are fantastic. Yes, this movie is bloody, and if you're under 14 you probably shouldn't go see it. But the focus of the story isn't the fighting. It's about the lengths humans will go to for love - to avenge their love, as in the case of Maximus, and to be loved, as in the case of Commodus. It's about love, and if that makes Gladiator a chick flick, then it's a chick flick. But it's the best gosh darned chick flick I've ever seen.",Gladiator

1011,Firebowl,"Ancient Rome lives again, supercool Crowe in this summer's certain Smash-hit",8,2 May 2000,"""Gladiator"" certainly is one of the very few movies this year everybody's been waiting for. And the waiting was sure worth it. In short, ""Gladiator"" gives you everything you might expect from it. It does not deliver less, neither does it deliver more: Half-hearted attempts to put more weight on the political issues of the Roman Empire don't work very well, and comments on the decadence that led the Empire into its destruction seem too much put on. These things only speed down a plot that is so action-packed, it would have satisfied the audience without that much thought-provoking stuff.In fact, it will make the audience cheer and yell for more, just like a long time ago in the Colosseum. Ridley Scott delivers visual images that are so intense and powerful, so detailled and simply HUGE, you feel like they were made for battlefield paintings the size of the Empire State Building (horizontal, that is). But the most unforgettable thing about ""Gladiator"" is Russell Crowe. His performance is simply beyond human. When Crowe stands in the dusty arena of Rome's Colosseum, making his already legendary revenge oath, you are simply blown away by his tremendous charisma. A look into his eyes, and you think that the concept of honor was not invented for him, but by him. After you have seen ""Gladiator"" you will certainly know what ancient Rome looked like (especially when it was Partytime in the Colosseum). You will not understand Rome's political situation, for the movie gives wrong facts (intendedly) and just doesn't work in this direction. But hey, nobody wants politics in this movie, anyway. It rocks, you will enjoy it, and you will yell for more. A Gladiator's work: Give the audience what it wants to see. They will love you for it.",Gladiator

1013,Lucifer-23,We Who Are About To Die Salute You,10,5 May 2000,"I have been waiting a long time to see Gladiator, having first seen the trailer for the film way back in December when I went to see Galaxy Quest. I must say that the wait was worth it. Comparisons have been made between this film and the earlier Roman Epics such as Spartacus and The Fall of the Roman Empire, but I think, all in all, this film holds it own. From the opening sequence with Russell Crowe remembering what it is like to walk in the wheat fields of his home to the final shots of the Collesium right before the final credits roll, this film was breathtaking. I have always liked movies like Ben Hur, and seeing a modern version of one of these fine films goes to show that sometimes a return to the old days of timeless epics would be good for Hollywood. Special effects pay a big part in the movie, and they have taken the place of elaborate sets that Hollywood once created. In fairness, the cost of making a film like Ben Hur or Cleopatra by today's standards would be astronomical. It would make the reported budgets of Titanic or Waterworld pale by comparison. If you need a computer to do what craftsmen once did, so be it. It is about the film, after all, more so than the sets. As long as they look believable. On a sad note, this was Oliver Reed's last film. I think he did a splendid job and only wish he could have been around to see the finished project. I am sure he would have been proud. I highly recommend this film to one and all, both as a glimpse into what life was like back then and as a return to a grand style of film-making.Hail, Caesar.",Gladiator
1014,ech,"A worthy film, though not without flaw",7,30 May 2000,"Gladiator is an epic film.  A moving story with good characters. I must compliment all the actors, Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix especially.  I felt I understood all the characters, each had motivation, goals, and a personality.  To those who have belittled Phoenix's performance, I suggest you check whether he was merely playing an unlikable and deranged character very well, or if his actual acting was lacking.  I think the former is the case. I did notice a few flaws.   The first was the excessive and obvious use of CGI, which I feel gave the movie an unreal and unbelievable look at times. The second flaw involves the historical accuracy of the film.  While this only slightly detracted from the film, I did find it distracting.  For example, I seem to have noticed stirrups in use (certainly the actor's foot position suggested stirrups), which weren't invented until the millenium after the time depicted.  Pens and paper, and other minor inaccuracies were to be noticed if you were in the know.  As I said though, these minor inaccuracies did not take away from the depiction of the film.  Of course, the largest inaccuracy is the eventual outcome of the film, with regards to the fate of the Roman empire, which I will not reveal.  In the end however, this is a story, for entertainment, not a historical documentary, and I am more than happy to forgive and overlook such transgressions in the name of a good film, which this definitely is. The only other complaint I have about the film was the use of cuts to the 'dream world'.  These cuts are confusing for most of the picture.  Who is having them?  Why?  What do they mean?  They gave the film a disjointed feel to me.  Though eventually the reasons for these 'dreams' becomes clear, their execution left something to be desired for me. The conclusion?  ""Gladiator"" is a fine film, worth seeing.  The closest to an epic film I have seen in some time, ""Gladiator"" regales with war and love, vengeance and madness.  What more can you ask?",Gladiator
1015,Schaphra,Very honorable man...,7,3 July 2000,"""Gladiator"" is excellent film. It has very strong message of honesty, honor, dignity and love. Do you still remember this words...? Russel Crowe is in a role of Maximus, Roman general, who is favorite of Marcus Aurelius, Roman Cezar, who wishes Maximus to be a Roman Protector, a guardian of Roman republic. Aurelis son, Commodus, has some other plans... Maximus was very popular amongst Roman army, but, over the night everything changes... In this movie, Ridley Scott guides us through ancient Rome, through it's plots, factions and nasty tricks. Great camera, picture, music and effects is visual luxury; movie has action, story, great players and moral. Oliver Reed is great as Proximus, the spirit of old Rome, honest and bloody, when human life has very little meaning. Violence in this movie makes the point - in movie where human life on battlefields has no importance at all, it show us how meaningless and horrible and monstrous is taking human life in Arena, or killing helpless women and children for political causes...Russel Crowe is really good. His tired face is representing human struggle between honor or surrender...",Gladiator
1016,Lofwer,The first truly grand movie this year,9,7 May 2000,"During the first five monthes of 2000, I sat through loads of dreck, waiting for some film to live up to the annus mirabilis that was 1999.  I went to Erin Brockovich, and was repulsed by the manipulation of the audience in that film, not to mention the deification of Julia Roberts and passed through the film.  I decided not to look for a good movie, just an entertaining one, and I went to U-571.  Instead of giving solid action, it tried to build characters into a story that couldn't handle characters. They piled cliches on an unsturdy frame, and the all film colapsed.  I really wanted Gladiator to be the film that I would love, and I truly did love it.  The opening has echoes of Saving Private RYan in style, but goes beyond that film because it truly ties us in to Russell Crowe's character, instantly.  We know who he is, we identify with him, and we are instantly willing to follow him through to the end of the film. All of the fight scenes are on a grand scale, perfectly mounted and expertly executed.  But there is more to this film than action.  Russell Crowe had better become a movie star with this movie, because after The Insider, he truyly deserves it.  He is a romantic, heroic, nobleman in the grandest sense of the word. Joaquin Phoenix is suitably over the top at times, yet there is depth to his characters.  He is a human villain, and yet a hissable one none the less. That is great movie making.  The political aspects of the film are also magnificent, adding a sociological dimension to the film that at no time feels like the film is teaching the audience.  It is worked into the story organically.  It also manages to work this massive scope into the context of a conventional, though thoroughly compelling and engrossing, revenge story. All in all, this is extraordinary, majestic, wonderful work.  Now that I've listed everything I can think of that is great about this movie, allow me to take this opportunity to curse the name of Hans Zimmer.  His score is, until the last twenty or thirty minutes of the movie, horrible, and should be excised from the film and replaced with something else in later incarnations of this film.  Hopefully this is less than 1,000 words.",Gladiator

Now I understand what scriptwriting courses mean when they say to avoid ""talking heads,"" and boy, this movie has exposition a-plenty. Long, draggy, incomprehensible exposition---anytime there isn't a fight onscreen. Plus, all of that exposition is done by predictable, cliched characters possessing as much depth as a sheet of paper. Not that the acting is bad---it wasn't. But if you've seen any entry in the ""they-killed-the-family-of-the-noble-hero-and-now-it's-payback-time"" genre, then you've already seen this movie. What's sad is that Russell Crowe is a fantastic actor, and ""Gladiator"" would have benefitted greatly from having a flawed anti-hero like his role in ""L.A. Confidential.""  And while this $100 million movie IS pretty (if a bit vertigo-inducing with rapid-fire jump cuts and camera angles), it seems to possess a lot more style than substance. Wait for the video.",Gladiator
1018,eshy76,An Instant Classic,9,16 June 2000,"Wow is all I can say to this....I went to see Gladiator expecting to see a great film and it delivered big time. The storyline and atmosphere of the movie is reminiscent of the classic Braveheart but this movie is just as good as Braveheart in its own right. From the amazing special effects (computer images are used extensively I hear, for example to recreate the Colosseum and also to replace Oliver Reed after he died in real life during the shoot!) to the breathtaking scenery; from the masterful treatment of the gladiatorial violence (split second shots of the gore, a la Braveheart again) to the outstanding performances of the cast, this film just oozes class from every pore. Scott is a genius and I don't believe that anyone would have done the gripping storyline of the movie any more justice than he has managed here. A real ""tour de force"" and surely the best film of the year. Endlessly recommended.",Gladiator
1019,s.g.miles,Maximus Entertainment,9,18 August 2000,"I went to see this film (Dragged along after a few beers at the pub), expecting a mediocre action flick with the odd piece of Roman imagery thrown in for good measure, and a storyline savaged by the usual gang of Hollywood butchers. Instead I was presented with top-class acting, characters with character (so rare these days), visual splendour, an easy to follow and intriguing story, choreography of the highest caliber and a soundtrack of genious. The most appealing feature of this film for me was the characters, in particular Commodus. How refreshing to watch a villain who displays so many emotions outside of those specified in the Hollywood standard template for bad guys. I enjoyed this film very much and think all involved should be commended. If you haven't seen it.......please do.",Gladiator
1020,movietom-2,Glad it's over,2,13 January 2001,"Well, there go two and a half hours of my life I can never retrieve.Perhaps a better name would have been ""The Comedy of Commodus"", as I laughed through most of this travesty -- that is, when I wasn't groaning. This is the kind of ""historic epic"" that is neither historically correct in the details nor the epic it considers itself to be. The endless historical errors are mentioned in other comments and in the ""goofs"" section of the IMDB page for this movie, so there's no need to get into them here. As for the epic part ... well, I spent much of the time trying to decide which real epic was being ripped off (""Braveheart"" a lot of the time; ""Private Ryan"" definitely in the opening battle scenes, via the hectic camera work and the leached-out colors).Let me put it this way: If you thought ""Legends of the Fall"" was a good movie, you'll probably fall for it again here.",Gladiator
1021,mrblabbie123,"Rip roaring epic/strong drama/great acting, score and direction/bad script",9,10 January 2001,"Gladiator-the film about Maximus (Russell Crowe) who, after the newly ""elected"" emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) kills his family, rises up in an attempt to defeat him. The film contains tons of splattery action, and he-man butchering, but Scott incorporates his brilliance into it, with constant symbolism, and true care for Maximus. With this, we get some of the best thrills I can remember in the past 5 years out of Gladiator's action scenes. Scott also incorporates some great drama, with a compelling and sad scene at the end, a feel for the evil emperor, and the aura of the scenery and its surroundings. The acting, all I can say is...WOW! Russell Crowe, anyone who doesn't appreciate his acting talent should be taken out back and shot. He is amazing! Angry, ferocious, honorable, determined, and seriously p***ed off. Joaquin Phoenix is as good, and almost better. Evil, disgusting, repulsive, but you have sympathy for him, and sometimes he seems relatively normal. Oliver Reed is great, but sadly he died during the film's production. Connie Nielsen is also very good, and Richard Harris, in his small role, is worth praise. Ridley Scott, who is unfortunately getting a little old, directs this film very well, like I've mentioned before, and inserts provoking themes inside the action and angriness. Praise for him. The score! Hans Zimmer did the rip roaring action scenes mostly, and Lisa Gerrard did the chants. This combines to be one of the greatest scores I've ever heard. Sad and heroic. Now that I've honored the other things, let me get mad at the scriptwriters. John Logan I've come to dislike with his idea of good films: dumb football movies (Any Given Sunday), awful horror movies (Bats), and a movie thats extremely good but script isn't (Gladiator). I think Franzoni and Nicholson had a good idea going, and Logan, who (I'm making an assumption) butchered the script with fake lines and totally off historical facts. Moving on to possible Oscar nods: Winner- Best Actor-Crowe/Best Supporting Actor-Phoenix/Best Score-Zimmer,Gerrard Now that I'm done with that, I'll say this: GO SEE IT! YOU'LL LOVE IT! ***1/2 stars out of ****",Gladiator
1022,mrblabbie123,Brilliantly graphic and stunningly beautiful,9,21 May 2000,"Ridley Scott's masterful ""Gladiator"" concerns a, you guessed it, gladiator who's family has been gruesomely butchered and has been thrown out of his position as general by the emperor Commodus. Soon, Maximus fights his way into the harsh world of the gladiator, and begins to defy an empire. Commodus soon realizes that he is becoming the underdog and is literally losing his fame. Soon, he develops a plan. The musical score is extremely beautiful and yet heroic and powerful. I have a gut feeling that will be nominated for Best Original Score.The director, Ridley Scott, who's previous films include the frightening ""Alien"" and the action-packed ""Bladerunner"", does a wonderful job as director in this flick. He knows when to use a tool and when not to, and sometimes he needs to know how explicit a tool can be, and he succeeds in this. The acting is superb. Russell Crowe is an instant Oscar nomination, and the guy (I forget his name) who plays the African gladiator is superb, and he might snag a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The sister of Commodus puts on an O.K. performance, and while Commodus is a weak and pathetic character and the actor does that well, he is pretty fake. Now, since my review is coming to an end, here is what this will receive: Nomination for: Best Actor Best Sound Best Supporting Actor (Maybe) Best Picture (A chance it will be) All in all, this is a 10 out of 10 movie, even though it has small pieces that are a little off-course, it's still a 10. All hail Gladiator!",Gladiator
1023,Dr.Tuba,A wonderful romp through Rome.,8,11 December 2000,"This movie straight off will not satisfy history buffs or IFC fans. However, it is full of smooth dialogue, great lines and scenery, and tons of emotion.  I didn't expect to be wowed, but some things just did it to me. I tried not to like the plot, but was simply overwhelmed by the spectacle. Still I cannot go higher than an 8 due to those plot points.  (if you read any of these reviews, you'll know... i'll spare you another list of flaws).However, this is Russell Crowe's film.  He oozes dignity, machismo, bravery... he is just 'da man.  Now while I'm not a huge Russell Crowe fan, this movie was made for him.  He dominates it like a Colossus, overshadowing other roles as simply the coolest character around.  His acting wasn't as colorful as some... Commodus was better acted... but he carried the image of the practical soldier who just wants to go home to the hilt.  A hero to look up to, which is missing in the modern culture for the most part.In all though, the film was a fantastical romp through the Roman world. Sure it had glaring inaccuracies.  Sure it had silly plot leaps.  But it was a movie to slam you into your seat and make you watch.  A well cooked steak and potatoes kind of movie.  I heartily enjoyed it.",Gladiator

Most of the action scenes were really cool even though not entirely original, but the story was boring.  The movie had nothing important to say, so I don't understand why we were forced to sit and watch many endless dialogue scenes that led nowhere while we waited for Maximus to kill someone else.  Best part of the movie was the opening battle where there was real ""setting up the mood"" scenes to delay us from seeing a visually enticing battle. The  only action scene I didn't like was where he fought the fat guy with the tigers... OK let me explain! Maximus killed about 8 guys in 20 seconds in one the earlier matches with incredible speed and skill.. but when he fights this overweight, slow, old  pushover Maximus was moving as slow as molasses.. and no one could just shrug off a tiger that has jumped on your back!!By the last few blows I was ready to move on but then I realized what I was moving on to..

I am starting to watch him in all of his movies, and he has made a true fan of me! His performance in Gladiator was exquisite.  He was just so believable.  His accent, though try as he may to mask it still projected itself into the movie and this I truly loved and found so fascinating about him. I love to hear this man speak. He does give a solid strong performance in this role. I have always been a fan of Oliver Reed and he will be missed. What a wonderful performer he has been and a wonderful addition to the ranks of all the wonderful actors their have been in hollywood. This movie is one that will be added to my collection.

A little long, perhaps (hey, I wasn't into Spartacus that much, either) but entertaining. The battle scenes were the best and Russell Crowe was as magnetic as ever.Saying that, however, it wasn't his best performance. The trouble with films like this where the speech and setting is ""old"", the performances tend to get a little wooden, as the actors can't act ""naturally"" in the role.Although the history is a little innacurate (commodus was killed in his bath not in the arena) but a movie is nothing more than just that, and so history should not really be taken into account and the movie can just be enjoyed.One thing I did like was the soundtrack. Well written and worth more than a few listens.Overrall 8/10",Gladiator

However, I have been disheartened on my Trip to Italy by its later leaders, such as Commodus, and so forth. Historical Films rarely break from the overall path History actually took, and when they do, it is normally a bad thing.Here, however, I am happy. Commodus, who was actually a real emperor, was a meglomaniac whose rule marked the beginning of the decline of Rome. And in reality, his death was followed by chaos. However, to see not only that emperor die in such a way, but also for the film to depict the restoration of the Senatus Populusque Romanus (or SPQR) to power was touching. Normally, I scorn historical films for not being like what really happened. Now, it is the actual history which I wish was more like the movie.Did this make any sense?",Gladiator
1034,thirumurugayuvaraj,A movie with heart,10,1 January 2010,"Thousands things have been already said about Gladiator. is there anything else left to say about this movie? definitely yes. there are three kinds of movies in this world, first one is copy work from other movies or novels or history, second one is a complete fresh idea or a fictional work and third one is a combination of both. well gladiator falls under the third category.The pace of the movie is decent but very apt for this kind of story. A journey of the man, how he see his world changing, collapsing, betraying and at times helping. We get more involved and impulse when the movie rolls on just because we are more informed of so many things which the man (gladiator)in the screen doesn't seem to know. We feel more painful than him, more nerve cracking than him and more betrayed than him.Few people love violence, few love sentiments, few love fictions or history and some more people love romance. put all this people together to watch this movie and they will say that they had their part in it. some times i keep wondering what happens now to the Rome when the end credits role, making me to question my IQ and convincing my heart saying its just a movie. well its not so!we always say the best is yet to come. gosh we are wrong , this is the best and better.

To say specifically,Russell Crow is at his best.His powerful voice along with magnificent acting made the movie a special one.Crow as Maximus makes you feel like a gladiator- the honor,the braveness, the pride as well as a true human being.Beside Crow, other actors are also in their best.Believe me you will not regret if you see this masterpiece.definitely you will feel the vain of a Gladiator.",Gladiator

Yet it fails quite badly with some of the dialogue being too unrealistic and/or too formal for viewers to empathise with the speaker.Putting dialogue aside this film astounded me. The set design was astonishing : Scott creates such an immersive world around the characters. From the blood soaked battlefields to the sprawling Coliseum, this film is absorbing. Even from a minor set such as Marcus Aurelius' house, the effort Scott clearly put in to set design and production is very evident.Alongside that both Crowe and Phoenix give very convincing performances that certainly match the quality of the production.Overall, while the at times the dialogue is a bit lacklustre, the visual dynamics paired with some incredibly convincing performances and a majestic Hanz Zimmer score make it plain to see why this film is held in such high regard.",Gladiator

This is a well-told story of revenge and political machinations brewing beneath the surface of the Roman Empire. I won't spoil any surprises or any of the film here. But let me say this Gladiators cinematography is extraordinary. The film looks beautiful from shots of fields, to the shots of Rome from overhead, the Colosseum, and the sky. This is a great-looking movie. The battle scenes are terrific. The gladiatorial combats as staged by Ridley Scott and his collaborators are some of the best ever committed to a movie. Russell Crowe is brooding, smart and efficient as the titular hero, General Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix literally chews the scenery as Emperor Commodus, an almost deranged Caesar. Nielesen shows depth as his sister while Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris are good in their roles. Oliver Reed in his final farewell performance captures Proximo perfectly as an apolitical entertainer and former gladiator. Long live the General Maximus, and long live this movie!",Gladiator
1041,Sasha_5,"Great film, with slight apologies to history",9,24 September 2008,"Gladiator is a great film, a must for anyone's library if they call themselves a student of film, history and/or entertainment in general. The film is a beautiful representation of the Rome of our dreams and a brief period, the age of Commodus, within that grand vista. The film did take several liberties from the truth: 1-Commodus was not a scheming adult but a bit of a lad when he became emperor; there is no evidence he did or could eliminate his father. 2-The man that killed Commodus was not an erudite military general but instead a crude brute wrestler, hired by conspirators to do the job. 3-His sister was not a victim of Commodus; indeed, she conspired to have him killed; he caught her 1st and had her exiled from Rome. 4-Far from being treacherous, Commodus was a relative ""babe in the woods"" who was assailed by conspiratorial senators who ""missed"" several times until that ""wrestler"" ended his reign, in a hot tub of all places.",Gladiator

Gladiator however I watched three times.. and the first time I just never wanted it to end.It's a pretty simple story. The hero gets betrayed and seeks his revenge against the villain. But I don't think I have ever seen that kind of storyline be better told than in Gladiator. The scene ""I am Maximus Decimus Meridius.. ...and I will have my vengeance. In this life or the next."" is probably my favorite in movie history.It's not really historically accurate but I don't care.

It is my favorite movie anyways, or at least one of my favorites.The movie just has a lot in it, from epic action scenes, like the opening battle, to really emotional scenes, this also is the only movie ever that made me cry, and i don't cry that easily. The actors in this movie are really skilled anyways (especially Russel Crow, it is one of his best movies in my opinion)You also really believe you are there. They really gave it the correct feeling.

I was pleasantly surprised.If you can get by the preposterous premise of the film, you will find a literate script, good performances, and a movie that really moves along at a fast pace.  It is the only Roman epic that I would willingly see again besides Spartacus.  In fact, there is a lot in Gladiator that can be compared to the first half of Spartacus but Spartacus remains the superior film.  I am glad that the producers of Gladiator chose to emulate Spartacus rather than The Fall of the Roman Empire(which was a terrible film) upon which the plot was based.Some good things about the film include the lack of sex and foul language which would have restricted the viewing of this film.  There is plenty of violence but it's in a comic book style and not too realistic.  The use of Oliver Reed and Richard Harris was truly inspired and they contribute to the film in the way that Alec Guiness contributed to Star Wars.  The overall quality of acting is very good.  The special effects are fine and the scenes in the Colluseum are especially memorable.It is not a great film, or even the best film of 2000, but I enjoyed it and would recommend it with enthusiasm.",Gladiator

I know there are a lot of historical inaccuracies inthe film, but that didn't bother me, after all this  is a movie not an history lesson. Anyone interested in the period and the real events can find plenty of books that will shed light on it.The plot was basically a remake of 'The Fall of the Roman Empire'(much underrated)with elements taken from 'Ben Hur'(hero loses everything and is thrown into slavery) and 'Spartacus'.

Let's just say that the last fifteen minutes of the movie were purely fantasy, while the rest might be written off as a...dream-version of history. Ahem. 2) The music was awful.  This is not Xena. Please don't subject my eardrums to the atonal wailings of some middle-eastern woman.  It wasn't appropriate to have synthesizers when you've got someone like Basil Poledouris who could've scored this masterfully with *real* instruments!Okay, onto the good stuff. I'll skip comments on acting and whatnot--it was good and bad, you decide. But I will say this: the political themes presented in the movie are entirely topical to 20th century America. Demagoguery hasn't ever been more rampant--listen to Gracchus, people. He knows of which he speaks:)  Secondly, watch for the comments on the folks who ogle men about to kill each other, and about the idea of bloodsport in general.  Then, look around yourself in the theater, and ask, ""How many people are here just to see a man and tiger try to kill each other? Or to see the 'big battle scene' with all of its violence?""

The gore is totally exarragated in many parts in which they were not necessary. You expect violence in a movie like this but it was just way too much. Also  all the other Gladiators would not have been that nice to Maximus in real life. They would normally just save themselfs. So the movie is not bad but not as good as it could be.,Gladiator

Part of this was the mobmentality that pervaded the college theatre where I saw it, withhordes of frat boys cheering and applauding at the goriestscenes.  Do they not realize they are just like the Romans inthis sense? I couldn't believe some of the dialogue that wasallowed to come out of characters' mouths.  Some of the specialeffects were interesting, particularly the construction of theColiseum, but the sped-up look of the scenes was extremelyirritating.

The beginning fight scene along with some of the shots of Rome shows why this movie is truly an epic. The total grandeur of the picture along with some excellent acting help make this movie one of the top 100 of all time despite some obvious slow points in the plot.  This movie clearly could have been 3+ hours had they fully developed the main characters and the plot.  The special effects are blended in nicely without taking away from the movie and it's realism.

It also has cinematography reminicent of Thin Red Line, which adds to a fantastic picture. One of the two problems I had with this movie, is that it seemed to attract a large audience of professional wrestling fans. I happen to think that anyone who comprehensively watches wrestling has the attention span of a 6 year old. So it felt like there were a bunch of 6 year olds staying up later than they should be to watch this movie, when I was there. Screaming ""Can you smell what the rock is cooking"" when the fight scenes are happening and ""BORING"" when they stop and talk. The other problem, is that it for some reason doesn't feel like a masterpiece. At the end, Phoenix didn't seem to be sooooo evil as he was hyped to be throughout the movie. He was just a misunderstood problem child who got mad at daddie for embracing someone better then him. He could have been more powerful, and evil, there are ways.",Gladiator

Russell Crowe really shows his chops, and I actually believed that Maximus was the most noble man on earth.  Phoenix also gave a good protrayal of a very flawed man, not just a one dimensional evil villain.

1054,Tessa-7,boys' film / bad computer graphics - what a disappointment,2,2 June 2000,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, but it was so badly made!The plot was minimal, the computer effects were very unconvincing, and some of the acting was sub-Eastenders standard (Joaquin ""my little busy bee"" Phoenix).Saying that, Russell Crowe & the late Oliver Reed were both very good - shame they didn't have one of Shakespeare's Roman plays to get their teeth into - if you want violence with a good plot, try Titus Andronicus.The cinematographic equivalent of a Chelsea match - just a boys film, and not a very good one at that.",Gladiator
1055,Thalya,A MOVIE'S MOVIE,10,6 May 2000,"And that's not a comment I throw around lightly. This ain't no stinkin' summer action flick folks. On the surface, it may seem all action action action, but really, thanks to the furious pace of the cinematography, the action (and gore) isn't centered upon at all. That's not the point. If you find yourself wanting to see it all more, you're no better than the mob in the Colliseum. THAT'S THE POINT OF GLADIATOR.Having followed Russell Crowe's career for some time, having seen him in interviews, and now, having seen him in Gladiator, I realize no one else could play Maximus because Russell Crowe IS Maximus. It's that simple. Gladiator in its early stages very much resembles his career up until this point, and in his dialogues (some of which Russell is said to have written himself) Russell is letting himself exist up on the screen under the pseudonym of ""Maximus"". Ridley Scott is known for taking massive images and then telling intimate portraits. While Russell's is a piece of the intimate portrait, the massive image of Gladiator is the Roman world paralleled as our own entertainment (not just sport)-centered way of life. The world Scott shows is dark, Rome a shadow of what it once was. His use of light is reserved for places where the ideal and metaphorical are able to peek through the canopy of the real: home, Elysium, forelighting, etc.. And indeed, light is rare, just as in the world Scott creates. But mind you, watch the characters for this as well: Lucilla and Lucius, what's the Latin root of these names? ;)In all, this is my ideal movie, going beyond what I could have ever expected coming in, knowing Russell Crowe, Ridley Scott, Hans Zimmer, and DreamWorks were all attached. The subtle commentary Gladiator offers on the experience of viewing the movie itself is on the same level as that of L.A. Confidential. That is the qualification that makes a well-executed movie go from a 10 to an 11 in my books.Light and Dark. Life and Death. Strength and Honor.",Gladiator
1056,socraticirony54,Just good.,7,19 May 2000,"Gladiator is nothing special, it's just good. At times it looks great and at other times it looks artificial and simply stupid. The character of Commodus is incredibly annoying, although I say that, he is the most interesting in that he is not your usual scheming cowardly little prick that you encounter in films like this, but is also deeply disturbed. The best scene in the film involves Commodus and his father in the build up to the murder, brilliantly acted by Harris and Phoenix. The story is dull in it's familiarity, there's nothing there really but your basic "" i want to get home to my family, oh shit my family has been killed by the bad disloyal Commodus so now i must get revenge because i am good and loyal"". Having said that, the battle and fighting scenes are very entertaining with plenty of fine decapitations. Considering all the trash produced in the nineties which Gladiator stands high above, it's worth going to see just for having some element depth, and not just being dumb futile crap. I'd say it would rank just about in my top 30 films of the nineties. Although with Scott's other films Bladerunner and Alien this does not compare. Gladiator is just good, nothing more.",Gladiator

Personally, I tend towards the latter emotion, though some of the violence is repugnant, but most of the times more insinuated than truly depicted. The story of Maximus, the Roman army general who loses all but his life and fights his way up  in the arena is fascinating though not highly original and the dialogue is not particularly strong as well.But the cinematography is excellent. The opening-scene wherein a Roman battalion take on a Barbarian army is breathtaking and most of the fighting-scenes are really well done also. The moment when the gladiators are waiting in the tunnel to enter the stadium where an armored giant is swinging a huge metal ball around gives you the feeling you are there yourself. Some of the acting is good, as is the music.Powerful stuff on the whole, and surely will fire up your adrenaline-level.

1059,King Yuriy,A horrible epic,2,14 May 2000,"This is the worst movie I have seen this year and I saw ""Romeo Must Die"". Popcorn farers will consider this movie deep, moving, and informative.  In reality, the acting is horribly melodramatic, more sentimental and overblown than anything I have seen in a while. I felt like I have seen every scene in this movie about a thousand times before:  that's how filled with cinematic cliches the plot is.  Only redeeming future are a couple of great fight scenes, especially the one with the juggernauts, which was the only time I found myself cheering for either of the sides.  That marks another major fault of the movie:  in the opening scene, it is impossible to tell who the characters are, and what side they are on, with exception of Maximus (who we simply know to be a Roman from the ads) and one big German guy too animalistic to be on Rome's side.  There is some foreshadowing done with a dog, who one expects to play a major role in the battle or to functon prominently in the rest of the movie, it does neither.  I am not even gonna mention the historical errors, but looking up Lucius Verus or the Gracchus brothers in the dictionary should be enough.  That, and I still haven't figured out why Romans should speak with a British accent.  Oscar voters should fall in love with this:  it's an epic, it scores huge at the box office, all performances are overdone.  If you ever liked a Fellini or a Kubrick film, stay away.  2 out of 10.",Gladiator
1060,viva-6,"Good, but not great!",6,26 May 2000,"This was a very well-made film with great acting and an interesting story. Yet I left the theatre disappointed. There was just something missing in this grand epic. Maybe character development?I would have loved to see the early years of Maximus and Commodus. Why is Maximus so beloved by the emperor - because he is a brave, honourable man? Why does he have such a low opinion of his own son? The fact that Maximus is the emperor's favourite is just a given. The reasons for that are never explored - we are simply told that that's how it is. So we never know why Commodus is who and what he is. In that sense I find the story to be just too simple.That doesn't mean it isn't worth watching. It just didn't grab me as much as I thought it would.

The shot when the camera pans across the battle field in the opening sequence is amazing, as the viewer sees the arrows streaking across the sky, the catapults launching in order, and the armies marching.

1064,LaChantefleurie,Highly UNDERrated,10,21 May 2002,"I was reviewing the comments above and was surprised to see that most of them were derogatory or lukewarm about the movie. There are some who call it an action flick and some who call it Oscar fodder, and truthfully, it is both. But even if you don't see all the different aspects that come together to make this movie so wonderful, the Academy did. There are REASONS that films win Oscars, in case you didn't know. **Possible spoilers, somewhere in the message, yeah yeah...**     First, let me say that my opinion was extremely biased against the movie in the first place. I was feeling sore that Russell Crowe beat out Tom Hanks for Best Actor, and didn't even bother to see Gladiator to see if it was justified. Before I saw this movie, I was grumbling, ""Piece of crap...Russell Crowe probably sucks...I know I'm gonna hate it."" After...well, my tissue box was empty, my mouth hanging open, and my Tom Hanks posters in the trash. I had never cried at a single movie until this one. What really astonishes is the large percentage of people who seem to hate it. Perhaps they're automatically going against the Academy because it picks so many crappy movies, but this time it was right on target. Those people were right, Gladiator didn't deserve best picture of the year. It deserved best of the decade.The blood and gore portrayed were real, and graphic enough to deserve an R rating. But they were not put there just for show. Every maiming/decapitation had its place in the movie. Partly why they showed so much gore is to chronicle Maximus' resignation to the fact that he must kill to survive, and not only that, but must kill in front of the bloodthirsty Roman public for entertainment to survive. He maintains a hearty disgust for it throughout the movie (""Are you not entertained?"") but doesn't fight it. There is no controversy on that point. To think that all the arena scenes were completely pointless is wrong! Through them, Maximus gains the support of the people and enough power to topple the emperor.Need I even mention the acting? Definitely! Russell Crowe deserved every praise he got, but there is one actor who didn't get praised nearly enough. Joaquin Phoenix. Most movie villains are corny or just plain evil, but Phoenix's Commodus is multi-layered and complex. He provides the perfect foil to Maximus, his dangerous insecurity makes him a loose cannon to compete with the gladiator's quiet confidence. By the end of the movie, I hated him with a passion; hated not only the character but hated him, so thoroughly did he immerse himself into Commodus. His insecurities make him all the more sinister, and as he was 'telling' Lucius the busy little bee story, he truly scared me. I was getting chills! I haven't seen him in Quills, but he was getting many compliments on that too. Let me just say that he's one of the best actors in Hollywood! British great Derek Jacobi delivers a sold performance as Gracchus, the pro-republic senator who enters the conspiracy against Commodus. Too bad he didn't get more screen time here, or something more remarkable to say and do. Derek is great in any movie, however! Connie Nielsen didn't really stand out to me; although there is certainly nothing bad about her acting, in a cast of such talent she was the status quo. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris complete the ensemble to make it the movie where everyone is an award-winner.If you want something that truly shines, in story, setting, cast, special effects, and pretty much anything else you can think of, don't hesitate to watch Gladiator. You won't be disappointed!",Gladiator

It is obvious to me that Academy members did like ""Gladiator"" much more than the other 4 films nominated for Best Picture. And when they voted Crowe as Best Actor, they were stating that he ALONE carried the film. His acting is SUPERB. I'm pretty sure that those who question Crowe's talent are not familiar with his career. Try watching ""Romper Stomper"" and ""The Sum of Us"" back to back to see what I mean. ""Gladiator"" is an excellent film. It was the year's best indeed. It's closer to Shakespeare than it is to ""Ben-Hur"" and other Hollywood epics of the past. It's going to be an influential film too...just wait and see. ""Gladiator"" is not ""Titanic"" nor ""Braveheart"". It's a MUCH better film. Its heart lies in its hero, not in its F/X or action sequences. Maximus! Maximus!",Gladiator

I thought it was dark, boring and I wasn't even impressed with the F/X. Then I saw it again...And it was a revelation. Once you let the film speak to you in its own language (and not the one of the old Hollywood films) then you begin to savor it. Of course there are some ludicrous scenes ( the final confrontation between Commodus and Maximus, for example) that don't change even if you see it 10 times, but one must credit Ridley Scott for having the courage of giving us a new, more authentic look of that era, even though it was much darker and bloody than other representations we were used to see in film. Russell Crowe is perhaps the key to the film's success. His performance is outstanding. I just hope Crowe is not going to become the next Nicolas Cage. I'd like to see him taking more risks as an actor, as he has done in the past.",Gladiator
1068,Melville-7,An overrated mess.,1,7 July 2000,"Aside from Russell Crowe's strong performance, GLADIATOR is a chaotic mess. The editing is jumbled and confused, especially in the Arena scenes. To say this confusion is ""realistic"" is absurd, since when facing an opponent in the Arena, the most important thing is to remain clearheaded and outmaneuver him if you are to win. The celebrated battle in the forest in the beginning is just a silly attempt to ape the D-Day segment in the similarly overrated SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. As for the supporting performances, the best that can be said is that Richard Harris is dour and Oliver Reed is enjoyably hammy. Joaquin Phoenix is never convincing for a moment as the emperor. His performance would be more at home in a modern high school pageant. The photography resembles a European perfume commercial more than an evocation of ancient times. I wasn't aware the only color available in Rome was gold. For a truly excellent version of the same story, check out Anthony Mann's superb 1964 FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. While both films are based on the same historical characters, GLADIATOR shamelessly ""borrows"" many plot points from the earlier film, to less effect. Russell Crowe's supporting cast cannot hope to compete with such classic actors as Alec Guiness, Christopher Plummer, James Mason and Sophia Loren in FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE. It would also be pointless to compare the directorial style of Anthony Mann, who is without a doubt one of the great American filmmakers of the 50s and 60s, with that of Ridley Scott, who directs like he's making a commercial for GLADIATOR perfume or a music video for a band dressed as ancient Romans. Just compare the finale man to man combat in the Arena in Scott's film with the same scene in Mann's. No comparison.",Gladiator

1082,Gilliam123,Gladiator,9,8 January 2012,"If you haven't seen Gladiator you've probably still heard of it. It is set in The Roman era and stars Russell Crowe, Joquain Phoenix, Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou, Derek Jacobi, David Schofield, John Shrapnel, Ralf Moller and Richard Harris. The plot is straight forward enough, but it is the depth of the characters that I feel make it far more interesting. Russell Crowe takes the lead as General Maximus, friend and apprentice of Emporer Marcus Auerlius (Richard Harris). When Aurelias names Maximus as his successor, Aurelias's son Commodus (Joqauin Phoenix) kills his father, banishes Maximus and assumes control of the throne. Maximus is bought into a Gladiator troop owned by rich ex-gladiator Proximo (Oliver Reed, in his last acting role). Maximus uses his military skills in the arena to get him all the way back to Commodus until it is agreed he will fight the Emporer one-to-one. Maximus then gains the trust of Commudus's sister (Connie Nielsen), Nephew (Spencer Treat Clark) and First Senator (Derek Jacobi). The stage is set for an almighty show-down between a lowly gladiator and his emperor. I found the film very powerful in terms of emotion and meaning, and Ridley Scott's directing is his best since Bladerunner. The ensemble cast, headed by Russell Crowe, works great, although what I don't understand is how Russell Crowe won the Oscar he was nominated for, but Joquain Phoenix didn't. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris perhaps give the strongest performances, as the film's 2 classic actors. The film is now 12 years old, but because of it's picture quality, and fantastic CGI, it looks like it could have been released yesterday. The final note is that Hans Zimmer's score is one of the best in any film made in recent years.",Gladiator
1083,chunga95,Epic for All Times,10,19 August 2011,"'Gladiator' is the story of General Maximus. Like the famous movie tag line Maximus is the general who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor. It has been little more than 11 years since this movie was made and its influences and precedents are legion. More than that, it may yet be the best of all the historic Roman movies (Ben Hur, Spartacus, etc).For one, the character Maximus is a great expression of the Athenian Ideal. He is a citizen soldier, trusted leader of one of Rome's greatest armies. He serves Rome because, in Maximus' own words, he has seen much of the rest of the world, which is brutal and dark - Rome is the light. He believes in Rome and in its exalted leader, Caesar Marcus Aurelius. Maximus' defining characteristic is love - love of country, love of Caesar, and most importantly love of his family. He does not seek power nor influence, he only wishes to do his duty with honor. Russell Crowe fleshes out this character expertly, and brings a quiet soul to a very violent life. Winning the Oscar for his performance understates how timeless and beautiful an acting job he gave.His antagonist, Commodus, is quite the opposite. While Marcus Aurelius pointedly prefers Maximus, he spurns Commodus from assuming the throne because of his weakness and immorality. Joaquin Phoenix deliciously plays the corrupt and vile Commodus and creates one of the great 'characters-you-love-to-hate'. When the movie was still playing in theaters the common review I heard was 'but I hated Joaquin Phoenix'. I would ask why, and the response usually centered around how 'creepy' or 'slimy' he was. Joaquin made the villain so sinister he made us hate him, as we were meant to. Connie Nielsen gives a heartfelt and stoic turn as Lucilla, who in many ways reflects the broken heart of Rome and its hope that it can be whole again.Most movies, particularly in the modern era, tend to cast antagonist and protagonist as very similar in character and ideology save one critical, large difference. Here, 'Gladiator' gives us polar opposites: Maximus the general who fights for honor and love and idealism, Commodus who schemes and lusts for self-serving power. It makes for an extremely compelling script with a venerated supporting cast, many of whom were already well-established classical actors such as Richard Harris, Derek Jacoby, and Oliver Reed. They bring gravitas to small but critical roles and supply the weight of Roman political intrigue.Enough cannot be said for Ridley Scott's vision and direction. In so many ways, the movie is an accurate portrayal of Roman history, and in others a wild fantasy of it. He paints a grand and imposing visage of ancient Rome that is as much a character in the movie as any actor. It gives scope to the stakes Maximus and Commodus are playing for. Stylistically, the influence of this movie has oft been repeated, but never duplicated. The violence is simultaneously brutal and vague, bloody and implied. The cinematography is at times elegant and vicious, still and harried. Its a great blend that keeps your eyes glued to the screen and leaves a thin, glossy veneer that elevates the movie above slasher B-flick violence, which is precisely what gladiator fighting was. The gray tones of Germania, the warm sepia tones of Trujillo, the bright granite of Rome - a wonderful color palette that Ridley paints with to perfection. I especially like many of the Rome scenes that mix shots in half-shadow, half-light underscoring the divided, dark nature of the Roman empire.Its a stylistically transcendent and progressive movie of conscience and soul that tells a very old, classical tale. Many professional musician friends of mine did not like Hans Zimmer's music score at all, but I disagree. Its simplistic and stirring and fits the movie perfectly. It cues the audience into the horror, the tension, and the grandeur that was ancient Rome. This movie will endure because it has a timeless soul and is told artfully and truthfully. I have seen many of the 50s/60s period epics that are so revered, but I do not think they will stand the test of time as well as Gladiator will. To me, a product of post-modern cinema, those movies do not connect emotionally nor historically. Ridley Scott brought an historic grittiness to 'Gladiator' that I think will endure and, consequently, was one of the forerunners to the last ten years of cinema where movies are now revered for their gritty accuracy, rather than their bubble gum ignorance of it. Like the conflict between Maximus and Commodus, 'Gladiator' is a refined study in balance and conflict and threads this needle expertly with as poetic an ending in movies as you'll ever see. It is great now, and still will be when movie lovers not yet born discover it.",Gladiator

The gore is less distressing (as with Pvt Ryan) and Russell Crowe becomes stronger - I like him better than Kirk Douglas in this kind of role, and Kirk is an immortal.  But to me, Crowe seems less contrived and self-conscious and just as powerful.  ""Spartacus Lite"" a la Ebert suggests to me that the older movie (filmed near my town) has more human faces and sentiment with no computer scenes (though some obvious painted horizons) while Gladiator can seem too perfect (and location-authentic in appearance as a result).  I found the Blade Runner quotes by the director heavy-handed (the crushing of the creator's head with unseeing eyes looking on, among others) but my family didn't notice it, despite many Blade Runner viewings. I loved Oliver Reed in this (after delighting in his role in 3-4 Musketeers) as well as several other actors in the supporting cast.  The simulated environments were hard to fault and very beautiful.  The battle scenes rank with the best ever - Cross of Iron, 'Ryan, Hamburger Hill, Platoon, Braveheart and others.  It is long and uneven with occasional clinker dialogue and a slow middle, but I and my family will see it yet again. With its obvious integrity and great production values I say it will stand the test of time.",Gladiator

This movie tries to get you to the Roman's era and it happens for several moments specially in the Maximus' fights at the Roman Circus, but in the begining there are too many fails in the script, and those scenes where you must feel deeply sad you don't get any feeling...  The movie has great music for listening to at home but is not ideal for the scenes, it doesn't support the movies' ideas... The effects are cold and don't support the scenes neither... so the movie just get in the middle of its way and there are some scenes where you can even remember those movies where the job is too easy and eberything's prepared for the movie before it was made...

These movies were made 30+ years ago, so I guess in the obvious lack of ideas the producers thought it would be a great idea to redo the same freakin' material.""Gladiator"" also draws obivious comparisons to ""Braveheart"" but ""Braveheart"" is a million times better movie. Or ""Saving Private Ryan"". Heck, ""Armageddon"" is better than this overrated piece of trash. Crowe's character's motivation is to avenge the death of his wife and son.

1089,Stef-22,Tragedy of symbolism over storytelling,7,21 May 2001,"The expectations of this film are enormous,, given the hype and popularity surrounding it since release. The acclamation accorded it is , no doubt, explained in part by cinema audiences having been starved of Roman epics for so long. The same phenomena influenced the hype of many early 90s westerns, few of which merited serious attention (Tombstone and Unforgiven)
Anyway, to return to Gladiator the viewer must always be wondering where is the plot, the story?. This is not a movie for the impatient, however, neither is it a movie for a patient viewer seeking true immersion in the story. The story is simply too ponderous. I always felt that I was watching a film and perhaps this is the worst crime any film can commit; the failure to let the viewer escape into its world and pretend for a period that this (the story)is actually happening - now and that he/she is a privileged witness to the events. None of the actors provide their characters with more than one dimension. Russell Crowe looks superb in the stills but in motion he  delivers no more variety of emotion than Dirty Harry (or worse Chuck Bronson in the Death Wish series!) Oliver Reed provides the few positive moments of feeling and passion. Mr Phoenix has 2 superb scenes as he murders his father and later when he threatens his nephew's life. Both are powerful, although the former is derived from Bladerunner - when Roy Batty crushes the skull of Tyrell.In the end we have a film which tries hard; delivering top stars; strong cinematography; an action charged setting but ultimately lets itself down by spinning a boring yarn. For a more entertaining version of similar events see The fall of the Roman Empire (1964).",Gladiator

The scenery is breathtaking; the action scenes are well done and the ending almost had me crying. (I would have been able to cry, but since the theatre was packed, I restrained myself.)All in all, a masterpiece. This movie is right up there with my all time greats, and I can't wait for the DVD. Also, buy the soundtrack! It's the music that makes the movie! I really hope this movie wins big at next years Oscars, it really deserves to.This is definately one of my favorite movies ever (if not my favorite.) Everyone should see this!!!

Russell Crowe is so natural as Maximus (as he is in every role he undertakes).  Joaquin Phoenix was a dynamite casting choice, and unlike many movie villains, he was complex and had such a wonderful history behind his actions.  The whole cast was MADE to act with each other.  The casting choices were perfect.The movie is magical because it so easily makes the audience believe its reality.  True, the story itself may not be true but Rome was portrayed so wonderfully.  Few movies (if any!) have been made that have been so believable in its atmosphere of the ancient, yet surprisingly advanced Rome (though its tastes for sex and violence might have been more than gruesome). However, Ridley Scott has toned down the gruesome aspect so that we can focus on the story at hand, which is moving and very enjoyable.This has become the highlight of the movie industry for the summer, in my opinion.  It has fast become one of my favorite movies!  I have not done it justice here.  It's definitely one to catch in the theatres.",Gladiator

A great deal of eye-candy, the eternal fight between good and evil, some gruesome action and a fast pace.Well, stand assured that they're all there (except maybe for the fast pace at times), along with some above-the-average acting. And before complaining about the end fighting sequence, keep in mind that emperor Commudus (obviously crazy at least as Nero) usually went fighting in the Colosseo against gladiators. The gladiators were obviously lethally wounded before the ""match"" to avoid problems to the emperor. Did Ridley Scott knew about it? I sure think so.Overall a good movie. Yes, explicitly violent - but the Roman age was violent. Probably not suitable to children, but a good movie for any adult.",Gladiator

Each of the major characters is almost completely unbelievable, especially Crowe's Maximus. You would get a better history lesson, a higher art, and more entertainment watching Spanky, Alfalfa and ""Our Gang"" do a rendition of Julius Caesar or something. ""Gladiator"" was so boring and bad that it did not even elicit any unintentional laughs. But you may groan in agony waiting for it all to end. No surprises, no titillation (something we have a right to expect from the decadence of ancient Rome), no effective moral lessons, no revolutionary film making. Fans of extremely violent video games might get a thrill or two, but that's it. Testosterone addicts who desire to commit violence against others and feel completely justified in doing so might relate to the protagonists in this film. I don't. It stinks.

1097,bollekeceuninx,"If this movie is a joke, then it's a bad joke...",1,22 July 2000,"Is this movie meant to be a joke ?  A parody of what it could have been ? A motion picture that presumes to be (visually) ""a Roman Saving Private Ryan"" but carefully avoids showing the horrors that were plain in Saving Private Ryan.  Somewhere I get the idea that either producer or director must have thought : ""Yes great, let him charge into his opponent and hack his head of with one single mighty sweep.  But, as we want as many spectators as we can get, let's put a tree between the audience and the guy who gets his head chopped off."" So there you are, half the movie embedded in a semblance of violence that pretends to be shocking but isn't in the least.  Which is acceptable if you're broadminded enough, after all there's the other half of the movie. Unfortunately the actors (with the exception of the revered Derek Jacobi) must have felt similarly about the ""action"" scenes, because they try with all their might to ""act"" their way through the rest of the movie.  There's nothing as irritating as an actor being very aware of the fact that he's acting and showing it !  See how good I am ? But even then : the story might be good. Which it isn't.  The story of ""Gladiator"" is a flimsy excuse for a second rate B-movie plot . With excuses to anyone who ever wrote a B-movie plot. Did anyone actually get paid for writing this ?  Historically staggeringly incorrect hardly begins to describe it !  Full of dead ends (let's not reveal the ""plot"") and dead dialogue. May I suggest something ?  Don't spend money to see it.

1099,Dash-7,Clarification on a great movie,9,9 February 2001,"'Gladiator', the fictional story of Maximus Decimus Meridius, is an excellent movie. There is a deep spirituality to the movie, an unraveling romance and breath-taking action sequences. Superb acting by the leads and supporters (Jaoquin Phoenix was incredible as evil Emperor Commodus) adds to the spectacle that is Gladiator. Ridley Scott hits the mark with his latest masterpiece. Now for some clarification. Some critics, professional and Internet-based alike, have stated that ""Gladiator's"" storyline strays away from the actual historical events that took place in ancient Rome. Please do your homework before you blatantly bash the credibility of a movie: at the end of 'Gladiator' there is a disclaimer: ""Although some characters were taken from actual historical events, the STORY IS FICTION"". Therefore, they can use the names but can write their own story. On a final note, Hans Zimmer has composed another amazing score. His other works include 'The Rock', 'Crimson Tide' and 'Backdraft'",Gladiator
1100,moviecat-6,"Something, something, but not very good.",2,26 December 2000,"There are probably some spoilers in this review.  On the other hand, if you have already seen this movie, spoilers don't make any difference and if you have not seen it, spoilers may not make any difference either because I very much recommend that you don't bother wasting your time to see it anyway.Considering the hype that Gladiator had before, during, and after its release to the theaters, this had to be one of my worst disappointments. The good guy-bad guy situation was so obvious that I think all the people involved with making this movie must have been too close to it to see what they were doing.  Either that, or they thought viewers were all stupid.  A little character development might have helped here.This movie is basically about two guys.  One is General Maximus something that ends with an s, something else that ends with an s, and he is a really, really good guy.  Then there is the son of the emperor, something that begins with a C and ends with an s, who is a really, really bad guy.  How do we know this?  The movie's first major scene is the general bravely leading his troops into battle (and fighting hand-to-hand himself, which seems dumb for the commanding general), and wins a great victory.  He then shows his fine personal side by having a heart-to-heart with the emperor.  General Maximus says he now wants to go home to his wife and kid and there is a gooey filmover that shows the audience what a nice family life he has.  His boss tells him that he wants the general to take over leadership of Rome since the emperor is about to die.  The good general goes away to think about it.  Then the emperor's son comes in and finds out this distressing information when he talks to his dad.  Naturally, he then murders his father so he can lead Rome himself.  What a bad guy he is!The general is awakened to find this out and examines the body so as to determine that he had indeed been murdered.  Things get worse for the general when the naughty son orders him executed.  A bunch of the son's soldiers then take the luckless general away.  They promptly botch the execution, however, when the general with his hands tied and unarmed somehow kills everyone.  The general then rushes home, but gets there too late and discovers that his family have been horribly tortured and killed and the farm burned.  Can the son get even worse and the general even better?  In this movie, the answer is yes, of course.The general is then captured and placed into slavery and made a gladiator in order to please the blood-thirsty people.  He then makes an amazing recovery to kill about a zillion other gladiators who have no redeeming characteristics.  The son implements his plan to lead the people by hitting on his own sister, making advances to his nephew, and planning 150 days of killing to cement his loving bond with his countrymen.  This guy is definetly no George Washington.While this is all going on, we movie viewers are treated to some of the silliest special effects ever.  In one scene, an ordinary chariot explodes when crashing into the side of the stadium.  In another, tigers pop out of the middle of the stadium to try to kill the already hopelessly overmatched gladiators.  Nothing works and the slave-gladiator continues to mess up the son's plans by killing everybody he faces.  Even ""the only undefeated gladiator in Roman history"" (remember when defeated, a gladiator is dead) is coaxed out of five-year retirement to come back and be easily killed by the indestructible general.The movie's ending is still more rediculous.  For historical accuracy, all the people in the movie, including the slaves, have perfect teeth, look clean despite impossible conditions of sanitation, and are so well fed that a few look overweight.  I just don't understand what everybody sees in this film.",Gladiator
1101,Rodion15,A superb insight into the intrigues of power in ancient Rome.,9,27 May 2000,"I went just reluctantly to see Gladiator, with the idea that it would fall wide short of Spartacus, but I was mistaken.   Its 150 minutes passed  quick as lightning; after the first time I saw it I was so amazed that I couldn't quite make up my mind as to the real quality of the piece, so I read some reviews and talked to some pals and got multifarious feelings that ranged from `A royal stunts-and-special-effects surrounding a void' to `A landmark that will get all the Oscars'; so I decided to enjoy it again and make myself clear. This movie has an excellent plot of noticeable roundness, full to the brim with nerve and surprise.  Though it hasn't all the appeal to me of Spartacus, it doesn't lack depth.  A weak point: It spares too much in blood and crudeness, which would be very valuable not for morbid curiosity's sake but as an effective means to represent the most brutal aspects of the Roman Empire and to make us reflect on the value of human rights nowadays and when compared to the most sophisticated of ancient civilizations.

Phoenix is very good as the complex Caesar. Despite what others have said (Roger Ebert), the computer generated city was as good as those of Episode One, in my opinion.

The fighting in this movie is so excessive and well-done, I've never seen anything like it before. The story is not a slacker, it really has plot (a good one i might add). The recreation of Rome was very accurate and the costumes were awesome. I know maybe they usually didn't wear as much but I happen to know that Gladiatorial fights differed from time to time. The only mistake i found was the repeating crossbow, which wasn't invented until 7th Century by the Chinese. But oh well... it still looks awesome.  The soundtrack is compelling done by Hanz Zimmer from the Rock and Lisa Gerrard from...? It's a wonderful soundtrack. The Gladia they used in the movie were well-made and the chariots were magnificent with an added blade coming out from the wheel. Buy the soundtrack. This movie doesn't have as much gore as it could have which is a plus since gore has been taking over Hollywood. I've seen this 3 times and I love it more EVERY SINGLE time i watch it. This is my favorite movie of all time, it beats braveheart by 0.5 of a point. I love this movie. It's magnificent. I recommend this to all people, even those who don't like too much gore.

1108,matanovi,A traditional matrix + the highest level of performance = An excellent motion picture.,10,29 May 2000,"I have to admit that I entered my local multiplex with an endless dose of scepsis about `Gladiator' convinced that it's going to be just another popcorn entertainment project of modern Hollywood postoriginality, and it is in some way, except it's, in my opinion and my experience, a lot more. And that makes him more than just worth seeing.The creators took a traditional matrix of old Hollywood spectacles and then did one of the hardest screenwriting jobs today and that's to lay a modern superstructure on top of it, balance the pieces well, measure the chill, the drama and the romance correctly and finally construct the visual performance in a manner which stories of this magnitude deserve. The creators did all that amazingly powerful, convincing and  emotinally hammering bringing todays artistic conscience and computer techinque abilities to the borders of possible never going over the line or overdoing the performance to make it in discrepancy with the given plot. HOWEVER ...... They did a crucial job to the film's final quality by rewriting the original draft which, among other differences, had a happy end, and that's something that proves that they knew what they were doing. I was very afraid, to say at least, that it will be a conventional happy-end-movie, and was prepared for that conclusion already seeing Russell Crowe and Connie Nielsen kissing in front of the sundown in the closing shot of the film, and if the original draft wa kept in the final version of the movie I would be even more disappointed than I was preparing to be, because the film was constantly promising a lot more than that kind of conclusion. I can't express how relieved, satisfied, moved and touched I was when that didn't happen.I have to say that the intro battle in Germania and the fight between Maximus and Tiger are two of five most spectacular action sequences I've ever seen in movies, the `big fight' at the end one of the strongest finales in history, and the end altogather delivers one of the most moving conclusions in recent times, and one of the most important in history of the world, too.All actors give strong performances, I myself was especially impressed by young Joaquin Phoenix and his magnificent portrayal of Commodus - one of the most repulsive, and yet believable bad guys I have ever seen - and also by his unique ease in snapping from character in one style of performance and film to another completely different, diametrically opposite one. The performance by young actor who playes Lucius will be the unsung one, although I hold that the kid was so good and convincing in his behaviour for the period his character's in, that he deserved a lot more screen time.I was sincerely moved by the film in a lot of ways a film can get to you, and think it's a proof, more than welcome one, that Hollywood can still make great, full-blooded movies which get under your skin even without much originality or genuine artistic idealism that always heads for the development of new approaches to storytelling. Or maybe `A traditional matrix + the highest level of performance' is a way to go if a lot of new Hollywood products will have the final quality of this one.

1110,Richard-211,Something missing...,8,7 July 2000,"8/10. I want to be more generous, as I enjoyed this film, but it has too many little weaknesses.I remember thinking as I watched it, 'if they cut the fight scenes, would I watch this film again?'. The answer is no.The fight scenes are excellent, if a little stronger than in Ben-Hur (et al.) in order to satisfy the modern audiences' bloodlust. I understand the comments likening this film to Braveheart. In both films you feel you are being given a glimpse of what it really must have been like to be involved. They are gripping scenes and, unlike Saving Private Ryan, the fighting comes along at nice regular intervals, a fresh hit to prolong the high...While the rest of the film is not too bad, I felt it was just a little simplistic. Only Commodus was what could be described as a complex character. His sister should have been, and maybe she was before the cutting room, but she ended up behaving like a Bond girl. The actors were up to it but I felt the quality of the script let them down. It wasn't ambitious enough. It was as though Ridley Scott lost his nerve and tinkered with it to ensure mass market appeal (i.e. shortened it and dumbed it down).I cannot leave without mentioning Olly Read.

The ambiance an production design created in all scenes is fantastic (from the battle in germania to the fights in the arenas). The Emperor is a very interesting and troubled character magnificently portrayed. Russell Crowe is a sort of a Mad Max of Rome. The dream scenes are magnificent and I could go on and on.

People, this movie is bad. It has no sensible dialogue, Joaquin Phoenix is miscast (he would've been strangled the next week by the praetorian guard), and Crow is slipping in his choice of trash. We're not even going to ask for historical accuracy (by the way, there isn't any) since that would be either too much or too confusing.No character in this movie had any depth. I am still curious how the whole legion did not notice the absence of their ""beloved"" general. I am lost at how a man who went to France ended up in a desert on a cart. I am amazed that at first this man doesn't care about anything, then he wants revenge, then he doesn't, then he yells at that queen, then.. you get the point. And after that, a slave owner who sent people to their deaths dies with ""honor"" on his lips. Then, a woman who stood by and did nothing while her brother was slaughtering people is preaching to the good citizens of Rome the merits of honor and justice (she preached to the crowds that came to see people be decapitated). The contrasts of good and evil were so well defined, that no three year old will be confused.This movie must rate high with audiences, but so does Scooby Doo. If you like the mental twists of Scooby Doo, you'll like this movie as well.",Gladiator

1115,blakes-4,A mighty tale from ancient Rome,9,22 November 2000,"The Gladiator undeniably on of the most powerful and emotional movies to come out in a long time. The plot in itself is simple, but powerful one and colored by complex personalities and political struggles of Rome. While not attempting to be historically exact, characters for example are taken from actual persons. General Maximus is based on modest Cinccinati of Rome who just wanted to be family man after winning the war. Commodus was a real Roman Emperor actually strangled to death on Colosseum by a gladiator (he liked to fight against gladiators, but gave his opponents swords made of soft lead so he could always win). Acting is excellent, Russel Crowe especially unforgettable as Maximus and Joaquin Phoenix is well cast as dreadful but unfortunate Emperor. Good camerawork and warm colors really pump life into Ancient Roman Empire. There are also computer-generated special effects, but they are not used excessively as in some movies (SW: Phantom Menace for example) and merely support storytelling and image of believeable Roman world.On the blood and gore department, Gladiator shows everything that is necessary to the story and doesn't go to extremes like some historical movies.Overall, Gladiator is much more than just a return to spectacles-it's a whole new perspective into an era. A Warm, touching movie with powerful plot and at the same time excellent historical spectacle made with good taste. Highly recommended.My Rating 9/10",Gladiator

1117,JulyHizon 18 male,TOO MUCH HYPE,5,4 April 2001,"I haven't seen many of the films that came out last year, but there's no way the AMPAS is telling me that GLADIATOR is the best one of all of them. Anyway, I thought the movie was okay. I don't think I'll ever forget it, but it wasn't that good. What I like was the sense of masculinity I felt while watching it. The costume design was awesome, the score was good, and the set decoration was also good. But the cast was sort of boring, the characters didn't have a sense of humor and all of them were always bitter and they all act the same. Russell Crowe did a good job though. I thought Joaquin Phoenix's character weeps and wines too much; how could a great cesar raise someone who's the exact opposite of him? And how come he is always kissing everyone? And the battle scenes could've been better. I didn't enjoy them too much because they're built on messy close-ups of blood rather than strategy. No one in the audience could tell what's going on during the fight scenes because the camera was always pointing in the wrong direction and when it was pointing in the right direction, the scene would change chaotically. For example, when the horses on the chariots kept crashing, I was too busy trying to figure out why they're crashing instead of enjoying it. And the sound kept skipping too! I thought HOLLOW MAN should have won best visual fx instead. But who cares!",Gladiator

Original scores and songs by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard gives you out of this world experience. Music has been used in places of dialogues, that many scenes in this movie are just told by music only without a dialogue.You can watch this movie again and again, you will still be mesmerized by this movie each time.

The special effects are lame (chariots have engines in them that explode?). If not for Alien I would think less of Ridley Scott, but maybe he needed a couple bucks or something.

The first time Crowe and fellow slave gladiators fight in the arena, Phoenix eclipses the scene with his convincing depiction of blood lust. One could watch the film again just for those few moments of insight into a genuine character.",Gladiator
1127,Jagged-11,Flawed and over-confident in its supposed 'genius',6,12 July 2003,"Gladiator is a film which contrives to be something more than just another 'no-brain actioner' but unfortunately the film tries too hard to be unique and simply wallows in its own pretensions and clichéd dialogue, delivered by unconvincing cardboard cut outs of characters.The plot,in short, revolves around Maximus(Russell Crowe) a talented Roman general who, after winning a huge battle at Germania,is privately chosen by the Emperor(Richard Harris) to be the next ruler of Rome. Commodus, the Emporer's son is informed of this and does not take the news well and swiftly reasserts his right to the throne by .....well I think the rest is already covered quite sufficiently in the 'Plot Summary' section, so I'll begin criticizing this bloated piece of historical nonsense.Ridley Scott is famed for his distinctive visual flair, and Gladiator is another impressive piece of style over substance, as Scott lavishly recreates imperial Rome with the aid of some imppressive computer graphics and superbly choreographs the elaborate battle sequences with brutal attention to detail. However once you get past these superficial details you discover the glaring faults that prevent the film from being as good as it should have been. Crowe's maximus is a fairly 2-dimensional character and his facial expressions seem to be limited to either scowling, suppressing rage, or just generally moody, whilst his dialogue consists of 'uber-hero' clichés all delivered in a typically macho, gruff voice lacking any inflection or emotion. Crowe can be a very good and versatile actor but he flounders in this role, remaining in dull monotone for most of the picture.The Film is partially redeemed by solid performances from Connie Nielsen as the tragic, but strong-willed, heroine and Joaqiun Phoenix completely camps it up as the vile Commodus to great effect and Derek Jacobi is impressive in a small role as a member of the Roman Senate.Many people love this film but I don't consider it to be particulairly special (maybe I'm too demanding) so I reccomend you check it out for yourself, but the fact this film won the 'best picture' oscar proves very little and only demeans the academy's already waning credibility.For now I'll give the film a mediocre score of 6 out of 10",Gladiator

This is a nearly three hour long movie doesn't feel long at all, when its over you just wish it would keep going. The action sequences are incredibly well made and put together. However, it doesn't just feel like an action film. Scott does a great job developing each of the characters through their dialogue and their responses to situations.

Ridley Scott is placing himself at the top of the Director food chain with yet another great film. Russell Crowe is Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix is Commodus, the battle lines have been drawn and let the war begin. Not just for country but for the love of a father. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris are so good in this film it is truly a shame that they will not be around to entertain us in the future. Gladiator shows us that a well written story and a well acted and directed movie can transport us to another time and place.

A fifteen minute trim could do it a lot of favours, and Joachim Phoenix is too much in certain scenes. On the other hand, its Crowe's finest hour, with good support from Oliver Reed and Richard Harris.Scott's recreation of the second century Roman world is outstanding and ambitious. Battle scenes feel like a Vietnam movie, gladiatorial combat is fast and bloody. What really makes Gladiator work is Scott's commitment to a brutal world. People die, and life is unfair.

It is an extremely emotional film that is both exciting but can almost leave you in tears. The gore is at a nice level: not to little to be unrealistic but you can watch it (mainly without flinching). It has a well thought out script which plays out in a realistic manner. I would have given it a 10 but I didn't for two reasons: A) nothing's perfect B) if you know much about history you will notice a few anachronisms. If you ignore the historical mistakes it is a very enjoyable and thought provoking film. I think Russell Crowe and Joaquin phoenix's performances were excellent which adds to the realism of the feature.,Gladiator
1134,addanilov1,My favorite historical movie,10,8 March 2014,"In modern times people used to be selfish, egoistic and greedy. They can do everything to reach their goals – even they can kill their relatives. People always were the same. They never change. Even in Roman Empire people used to be such.Ridley Scott clearly knew that and decided to make a movie ""Gladiator"". The whole crew and cast are fascinating: Ridley as a director, Hanz Zimmer writes soundtrack, Russell Craw and Joaquin Phoenix as a main characters – it's definitely a masterpiece!The plot of the picture is that Emperor Marcus Aurelius' was killed by his son Commode, and Commode unfairly became Emperor and made general Maximus a slave. Maximus' family was cruelly killed also by Commode. And Maximus began to revenge for justice. This movie is a big adventure of one person who didn't want to accept what is happening in his homeland. He is the only one who wanted to change something. And he changed.I am really proud that the world have such great people like Maximus. He is the one to which all people should be equal. People betray, take bribes, do unfairly things. And Maximus is impersonation of justice, devotion and all virtues. The film touched a lot of topics: politics, problems of higher and lower societies, compression of the old and new generations, respect for traditions and history and a lot of another life problems. It can be good ground for reflection. ""Gladiator"" – it is like the Pacific Ocean – very extensive and full of mysteries, intrigues and adventures.In my opinion it is legendary movie that people will watch at any time.

Great plot and I recommend anyone who loves action to see it. A father trying to return home safely to his family after raging a war. It really speaks to us about how man for many years conquer territories. It truly speaks about war and destruction. How people really got through that time I loved every minute of this movie. Russell really puts on the show of his life in this movie. I like the bloody and gory parts in the movie. Anyone who is very squeamish should not see this movie at all.

I think if I had of watched it when released I would've not been in a frame of mind to comment with any intelligence.Maximus, as portrayed by Russ, is somewhat of a complex character. Deeply loyal to his Emperor,( Richard Harris) Stirling performance.. with a sense of true dignity, and leadership. He is, the complete opposite of Joaquin Phoenix, and that is what makes this movie so very compelling. One is a total Monster, ( brilliant performance by Phoenix) and the other by contrast A Genteel Warrior. I could care less about the rest of the props, support cast etc, except those gorgeous cats, Maximus ( Crowie) just draws you in, IMHO and that's the thing that makes movies watchable, enjoyable and plausible, whether based on fact or fiction.

Also the fights of Gladiator as slave are brilliant and suspenseful. The film is probably more appreciated if you're interested in Rome and all that has to do with this former empire of the Earth. Not only Russel Crowe but all the actors did a great job. I especially loved the role of Commodus though he is the bad guy. A mighty character, but then again, not almighty.

1143,hmcnally,"Well recorded sound on DVD, little else",3,12 March 2001,"I rented Gladiator (1) to try out my new home theater speakers (upgraded from ""2.1"" to ""5.1"") are any good and (2) to see if Roger Ebert is right, whether this could be the worst movie ever to win the ""best picture"" academy award.  The answer to both my questions is ""yes.""Wow, this flick really sounded great on my stereo, dts encoding a special treat!  Even the perfunctory and unremarkable ""epic music"" sounded good.  I was able to tune up all 5.1 of my speakers, so don't touch my levels, I got them set just the way I want 'em.  And now, the bad news.Gladiator is overlong, overdirected, underscripted, and totally forgettable (aside from a being DVD showcase).  It's hard to make a good epic. Spartacus this ain't.  Moreover, as good as the sound was, the visual effects looked artificial.  The tigers in one of the fight scenes were particularly cheesy.  In the action sequences, it looked like the actors were filmed as they moved slowly, and then were restored to real speed through mechanical/digital means... this makes everything well focused, but ironically, a perfectly focused swinging forearm w/broadsword looks more like claymation than reality.The acclaim of this movie doesn't astound me--people like gladiator movies. Indeed, all I kept thinking of as I watched was Peter Graves' line from ""Airplane"": ""Joey, do you like movies about gladiators?""  Hey, at least I got a laugh when I thought about this... 2.5 hours of total humorlessness is tough on a viewer.  ""Saving Private Ryan"" had more laughs than Gladiator. Oh wait... the exploding firebombs in the opening fight scene had me howling.  I love anachronism.Such an oh-so-serious tone should be saved for the likes of Schindler's List or Judgment at Nuremberg.  Gladiator fails at profundity.  In trying to be an action flick, it fails worse--it's an hour too long.  As an ode to history, I have no idea--I have problems identifying, much less cheering for, the ""good Romans"" of the reign of the Caesars.",Gladiator

There was some superb acting, but the way the film was put together just comes off being very superficial.  If a ten-year old boy was to make a movie, this would be their approach.In a certain sense, the setting of the film was a time of rather simple people, so in that sense the movie could work.  However, all these dream sequences are tacked on seemingly to try and give the movie some kind of deeper credibility.  In that sense, the movie as a whole fails.

1145,JackMcVee,Awe-inspiring,10,13 May 2000,"I was SO surprised by this movie. I saw commercials for it on tv, and just passed it off as another no-brains-all-brawn-popcorn-action flick. Not that I dont enjoy them once in a while, its just the commercials and ads and stuff didnt intrigue me, nor did it make me raise an eyebrow. BUT, my friend dragged me along to see it anyway, and I was pleasantly surprised.I wont bore you with the plot of the film, but let me just say - this movie has brains AND brawn. Everything was nearly perfect. from the visuals, to the acting, to the filming locations - nearly everything.The characters were interesting, which was a breath of fresh air in these types of movies. Maximus -- dear lord, I've never cheered somebody on so loud. He 's a sympathetic figure, as well as a noble one. Russel Crowe deserves an Oscar for this. Commodus -- did anyone else wanna rip this man's head off? Especially after that ""squealed like a girl"" comment... but Joaquain Phoenix created a three-demensional villain. Lucilla -- another sympathetic figure. Connie Neilson did good with her character, a lesser actress would've made her seem like a downright wimp.
Proximo -- Oliver Reed was indeed a great actor, and I'm glad to see this was his final role. All in all, Gladiator was a fantastic film. --But, this movie is NOT for the squeemish.

Excellent fights (though my girlfriend said some of them were ""splatty""....  she liked the movie, too, though) and the ending was great.

1147,Blim,Extremely Disappointing...,6,28 July 2000,"This has to be one of the most disappointing films I've seen in awhile. I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe, unfortunately their collaboration on this film resulted in an extremely boring film with drab cinematography and no heart. I will admit the opening battle scene is pretty impressive, and all the other battle scenes are above average. Everything in between is mind numbingly boring, the plot was like something out of the Street Fighter games I played as a kid.With an epic film of such scope like this I expected at least some nice cinematography, but it was dark, and uninteresting. The CGI collisium was equally disappointing, it looked like a model out of a computer game and like Roger Ebert pointed out, the fans in the stands were blurry. Ben-Hur or Spartacus were a lot better at giving you that feeling of being in acienct Rome and just sucking you into their world, this movie left me feeling distant from everything that was happening on screen.Although Russell Crowe gives a respectable performance as Maximus, all the characters were uninteresting. I didn't feel anything for any of them and when the emperor was finally killed I was just happy the movie was almost over. If the relationship between Maximus and his family had been more fleshed out I might've felt some more sympathy for him, but when he kissed commodus' sister, all sympathy i had for him disappeared.I think one of the reasons the movie is so popular might have to do with the fact that although there are long boring scenes, you quickly forget about them when people start getting their heads chopped off. It's unfortunate when a movie like this comes out and immediately catapults up to #59 on the user top 250 when films like The Thin Red Line aren't even on the list. Go rent Spartacus for a better film set in ancient Rome.**/***** 2 stars out of five",Gladiator

I'm used to gladiator type films being lavish, with warm earth tones, lots of red cloaks and reddish dirt and dust kicked up by horses' hooves. This is really dark and blue, and the MTV style editing and grainy film stock make the battle sequences obscure and confusing. I'm also used to Charleston Heston or Kirk Douglas bellowing to his comrades, leading them to heroic acts of vengeance. Russell Crowe is much more subdued, I'm not saying that's bad, he does a remarkable job and is the best part of the film. Once I got used to the stark contrasts and the story gathered momentum I began to enjoy the film much more.

1150,richie-29,"great action, no heart. (SPOILERS)",5,14 May 2000,"I came into this movie hearing rave reviews about it, but afterwards, I must say I was rather disappointed. To be fair, the CGI shots of the crowds at The Colluseum were gorgeous, and the fight scenes were top notch. However Gladiator was missing something that other historical epics had, and that was emotion. In Spartacus, we see the horrible conditions that Spartacus and the slaves lived in, and we rooted for them to fight for their freedom. In Braveheart, the film spends a great deal of time developing the romance between Wallace and his wife, and when she's killed by the English, there is a greater emotional response when Wallace fights the English. There was none of that in Gladiator. Although, we see Maximus' wife and son murdered, I felt nothing, since practically no time time was spent fleshing out their relationship. And also Maximus' goal is to overthrow Commodus as emperor and bring control of the Roman Empire to the Senate. I don't know about you, but government restructuring pales in comparison to trying to topple a kingdom. By the time the movie ended, I really didn't care who won or lost. I give Gladiator a 5/10 (5 is for the special effects.)",Gladiator

Besides great fun, Mr. Scott gave us lessons on art and human virtues.  I can hardly wait for Hannibal. 10/10",Gladiator

I don't want to go yet!!!,10,7 May 2000,"The opening scene of a hand trailing through the tips of soft wheat as it blows and the ferocious battle that occurred after sucked me right into Ridley Scott's new picture starring Russel Crowe (L.A. Confidential) and Joaquin Phoenix (8mm).  The story line is so heartbreaking and triumphant at the same time it leaves you breathless afterwords.  Spectacular acting by Crowe and especially Phoenix who intimidated me in the audience.  The cinematography was beyond amazing and Scott's eccentric style of filming battle scenes is intriguing.  I was anticipating this movie very much so because I grew up watching Ridley movies like Legend and Blade Runner. Those were standard must have movies and must see in my family.  Take it from me, see this movie...don't be stupid.",Gladiator
1153,Bernie-58,"Sword and sandal epic revived, as boring as ever",2,1 June 2000,"So Hollywood revived the long forgotten sword and sandal epic, absent from the screen in the last decade(s). In the case of Gladiator, it would have better still not be revived.Gladiator comes along as a multi-million, box-office super-seller with actually nothing behind it. We get the mass battle scenes, some sword-dancing fights between gladiators and a lot of togas. The plot: not outstanding, the characters: cliché-like. No character gets really developed, everything is aimed at a sensual overflow (sometimes intersparsed with un-motivated sun-set shots). In addition to that, the shooting is quite poor: murky, unfocused and plain. The body count is high, but triggers no emotions (kind like a splatter movie in sandals..)To put it simple: I had to fight to stay awake, save your (over-time) money for some better films.",Gladiator
1154,Goldmine-2,"Good film, but not so real",8,7 September 2000,"""The Gladiator"" is really a great film. You can see the fantastic way of filming of Ridley Scott, the sceneries are marvellous and also actors are really good. The plot is very simple, but effective. There are all the main elements to make this film a ""Kolossal"". It reminds me many films about the Ancient Rome, especially ""Spartacus"" by Stanley Kubrick. But the main difference between these two films is that ""The Gladiator"" is very approximate in its historical elements while ""Spartacus"" (as also other films about Rome and,generally, historical arguments)is very accurate. For this reason, I think that Gladiator is a good film, but not a good historical film. There are too many wrong elements. I can give some examples: in the initial battle we see many crossbows which did not exist yet at the time, or the (marvellous, anyway) scene of the Colosseo with all the flags at its top (it was more similar to Wembley Stadium rather than the real monument!!!) and other little things. Oh yeah....another important mistake: the film shows us Rome as a big city,with streets, with many people and around the central city......NOTHING, no streets, no little cities, only some isolated houses somewhere.....that's not true! Maybe, I'm a little bit meticolous, maybe because I love history....but I think it is to pointed out these little mistakes. Anyway, the film is really good and I gave it an 8!",Gladiator
1155,reccepatrol,A definite Oscar worthy masterpiece,8,24 May 2000,"When I planned to go see Gladiator for the first time, I knew it would be good. But to be honest, I never expected such an incredible motion picture. Russell Crowe delivers his best performance yet. Joaquin Phoenix, a relative newcomer to the movie industry, does an incredible job as the lauded Emperor. It tells the story of a General(Russell Crowe) who is betrayed by his new Emperor(Joaquin Phoenix). His family butchered and his life destroyed by the Emperor, General Maximus finds himself in the ranks of an ex-gladiator who trains slaves to fight in the rink. But Maximus is bent on revenge. And so an epic battle between good and evil unfolds in those heart-pounding two and a half hours. The battle scenes are terrifically put together. They even rival the ones from Saving Private Ryan. And as for the casting, I don't think anyone could have been better cast. So far, Gladiator is my top vote for best picture of 2000(And I've seen everything). A little bit of friendly advice. Go see it twice. You can enjoy the awe of it all the first time, then enjoy the terrific dialogue even more the second time(at least that's my theory)My personal vote: 8,00$/8,50$(It's a long story, but that is my rating system)How to see: Cinema",Gladiator

The budget was astronomical, but the quality was poor. Russell Crowe tries very hard to put on a good show, but does he? NO!! He can't act.

We then enter fabtasyland for a short while while Maximus rides from Germany to Spain and is then captured by slavers in the middle of civilised Rome and taken to Morocco. mmm.Proximo is a great character played by Oliver Reed, but then we get to a series of difficult to appreciate gladiatorial combats that frankly had little entertainment value and were gratuitous.Not that they were't authentic, just that they had little cinematic value.The film then drags on for ages and eventually the almost Goth-punk Emperor fights Maximus in the arena and is killed. ho hum, I was begging for the film to end by now..Now why should this film, which is quite authentic, not implausible and both modern and Roman in morality, be disliked by me so much?I can only echo Ebert that the film is dark, dull, morbid and has no flair.

I don't think any other actor can show anger better then Crowe, and Maximus has a lot to be angry about. It's almost three hour running time is appreciated because the movie never gets dull and the I was still thinking about the action scenes as I left the theatre.

I am not going to write a long comment to explain the shortcomings of this movie because they are so obvious. First of all, the movie was full of clichés and exaggerations. The plot really lacked originality. This was actually the ROMAN VERSION of BRAVE HEART or the latest version of BEN HUR rather than gladiator. I cannot understand why such a stale plot was used...Secondly,, the visual effects were fairly poor, apart from being realistic. For instance the tiger was like a character of one of Disney's animations. It was obviously non-realistic.. And it was also too obvious that the upper part of the coliseum was computer-generated..In the next place, the movie was unreasonably long; long enough to bore the audience. So, all Gladiator fans; please stop giving this poor movie more than it deserves. Since the production cost of this movie was high, some thought this was a great movie, who are fascinated by the fake beauty of gladiator!!! This is the unfortunate fact about gladiator.",Gladiator
1162,coboconk,Honourable mention,8,2 November 2000,This movie lived up to the hype that accompanied it. The fight scenes and the opening battle scenes were breathtaking and seemed all too real .  The vistas of classical Rome were impressive. On the downside I think that Joaquin Phoenix was a mediocre choice for the role of Commodus . He just didn't seem truly evil. Instead he overacted and seemed to be trying to convince the audience of his malice.  Crowe's character Maximus lacked direction and conviction and so the movie as a whole lacked a central objective. Instead the individual yet fabulous scenes stole the show.  To sweep the Academy Awards like Braveheart did I think that Gladiator needed to become a fuller epic by weaving in  more war scenes .  As one review mentioned already  there is room for a movie depicting the roman legions and their wars.  But in this movie the war was a backdrop and it was underutilized.  Honourable mention at the awards.,Gladiator

I like spectacle films, especially when they're dealing with the Roman Empire. I must remark that ""Gladiator"" isn't worth much historically spoken. It's 99% fiction and 1% history. Marcus Aurelius was succeeded by his son Commodus and the latter was in fact a hideous man, but he wasn't murdered in the Colosseum by a gladiator who actually was an army general. There are other flaws in the film, but those are based more on historical misunderstandings than on faults by the screenwriters. If you want to read about this, an author named John Kelly wrote an article about this. It appeared in one of our Belgian newspapers, I don't know the original, English title of the article (sorry!). But on the other hand, I don't think it was the meaning of the filmmakers to make a historically correct film.

What pushes this film beyond it's beautiful setting and brilliant cinematography would have to be the acting.  Russell Crowe outdoes his performance in ""The Insider"" as a moral man determined to grant Caesar Marcus Aurelius' wish of not allowing his son Commodus from taking over.  Joaquin Phoenix finally has achieved a role which allows him to fully let lose as Commodus the ambitious and manipulative son of Marcus Aurelius.  The reason Gladiator is so appealing to such a wide audience is because it touches many moral areas including the afterlife and longing to reunite with family.  This film will undoubtably win the Best Picture oscar along with many other awards.",Gladiator

1169,imt206,Why does everyone think this movie is so good?,1,2 July 2001,"I don't understand what all the fuss is about this movie.  I mean, was I the only one who noticed how crappy the screenplay was?  All right, there were some good special effects, but that's about it.I cannot believe that Gladiator even got a best picture nomination, let alone the oscar.  That has to be the biggest travesty ever in oscar history (even bigger than Shakespeare in Love beating out Saving Private Ryan in 1998).  I know that Dreamworks had to have at least one best picture nomination, but why didn't they push Almost Famous?  It was such a better movie than Gladiator.  I think Almost Famous was actually one of the top five movies of the year, and it would have made much more sense if Dreamworks has pushed that movie instead of Gladiator.
I guess I'll compromise and say that I don't disagree with Ridley Scott getting a Best Director nomination (only because he got a DGA nomination), and I thought Russell Crowe was pretty good as the Gladiator, so I won't protest his nomination, either.  But other than that, Gladiator did not deserve any other major nomination.  The most appalling one is best original screenplay.  What was the Academy thinking?  And what was up with Joaquin Phoenix's nomination?  There were so many more deserving supporting roles this year, like Michael Douglas in Traffic and Mark Ruffalo in You Can Count On Me.All I can say is that I've lost all confidence in the Oscars.  It's not about the quality of the film anymore, what counts nowadays is the campaign. It's such a shame...........",Gladiator

1176,Decinian,Hmmm... a plot...interesting...,9,30 July 2002,"There is an ever more popular trend in Hollywood movies now-a-days. The trend is taking a substance, called plot, out of scripts by mass amounts and filling these gaping holes with another substance called action. Now dont get me wrong action is fine in the right amount of dosage and for the right movies however now thier seems to be an overflow of this stuff. As you can tell by the sarcasm in my comments that i like this movie and i like the fact that it takes the time to set up a story rather then jump into a bunch of bull. And becuase of an overdose of this plot this movie gets a bad wrap. I personally love this movie and was what turned me on to history. Now with that out of the way lets talk about the movie. I must say that nearly every aspect of this movie, from the extensive amounts of weaponry created to the acting and directing impressed me. Ridley is a fantastic director and does a phenominal job with this movie, using old techniques of movie making with modern day technology was a stroke of genius. The historical accuracy ( the armor, arms, and buildings. Not the story ) was amazing, from the blade of a sword to the grandure of Rome astonished me. Music! The music makes this movie and sets the mode so well it almost makes you weap ( well, not really but you get the picture ). Hans Zimmer is truly a god at music, i respect him a great bit now. All actors in this film do a great job, however Jaquin Pheonix really stills the show. Playing the very disturbed and conflicted Commodos, Jaquin does a great job expressing conterdicting emotions and facial expressions. Though the story is well told and petty solid ( with exception of some historical inaccuracies ) it is not that original, of course then again what is now-a-days. And.... geez i didnt realize how much i loved this movie well lets cut to the chase. Im not gonna insult you or call you an unitellectual if you didnt like this movie or thought it was boring, becuase i can understand what your complaints are. I just dont agree with them. But if you liked BraveHeart or Spartacus you will not be let down by this movie.

That means it allows enough time for the characters to develop, so that the viewer can get attached to them and not stay indifferent, thus, making a three hours long film, interesting rather than boring (like LOTR). At the same time, the plot moves quickly enough to stay interesting, original and surprising.The special effects, as are the battle scenes, are SUPERB! By far, the best I have seen, and what makes Gladiator such a great film, is that it doesn't rely on them to make it so good (again, unlike many other films of the genre, or most action films for that matter).You got it right for a change guys - well done!!!

The battle scenes are some of the best I've ever seen, thrilling and realistic. Joaquin Phoenix is also very good as Commodus.WARNING---SPOLILERS CAN BE FOUNDNow for the bad parts, and unfortunately, there are many: Damn it Ridley Scott- Read a history book! The movie is FILLED with historical mistakes and errors. I tried no to think too much about them, and I tried not to care, but when they are so obvious and incredibly silly, I could not ignore them. Here are only four of them, to keep it short. FIRST: The Germans did NOT stand in an open place, waiting as the Romans loaded their siege equipment and prepared their archers. Speaking clearly: The Germans were not freakin' STUPID! They used a type of guerrilla warfare, hiding in their forests, and making surprise attacks, often at night, when the Romans were camping and resting. SECOND: SO, Maximus rides from Germania to...Spain? wounded? And taken by slavers to northern Africa? That would have taken months, even years! THIRD: Maximus is what..Spanish? The word Spanish was'nt even invented by 180 ad. Spain was called Iberia and the inhabitants Iberians, and these where barbarian warrior tribes of possible Celtic origin. FOURTH: The emperor is fighting a gladiator in the Colosseum? Very silly.Furthermore, the acting could have been much better. Russel Crowe is quite boring! You can't feel for him in the same way as you could feel for Mel Gibson in Braveheart, just for example.I know- Everyone is NOT historians, and some only want to get entertained and have some action at the screen, but I can't help but feel that this movie is overrated.",Gladiator

My mind has already wander away from this dog of summer. What other movies are based on the Nova series? Well there's ""Twister"" and...",Gladiator
1191,Robert-74,"Excellent movie, highly recommend it",10,3 May 2000,"Gladiator is one of those films that grabs you from the first moment until the last.  There are no real points that seem to drag on, as many movies of this length (2:45) seem to contain.  Russell Crowe is superb in his portrayal of a Roman fighter and gladiator.  The film using nice camera work and interesting imagery for transitions from scene to scene.  And the set of Rome itself was nice.  I didn't like how dark (not evil-dark, just plain dark) it was many times, making it hard to see.  And the theater I saw it in had a bad sound system, so it didn't sound very good.  But it was a free advanced screening, so hey, who's complaining =)SPOILERThe only thing I really didn't care for was the handling of the ending. The way Maximus finished off Caesar was not very exciting.  Final confrontations in action movies should be more...actiony.",Gladiator
1192,Ironclad,A quick observation....,10,2 December 2000,"I saw Gladiator in the theater, and loved it.  I commented on it on IMDB back in May, 2000. I just purchased a copy on DVD, and noticed that in the beginning, in the moments just before the battle against the German barbarians, that the battle cry the Germans are heard to make, is from the movie Zulu!  It is repeated at least one more time during the battle.  I'm not complaining, but just thought I'd bring this up(as I just watched the movie Zulu yesterday, also on DVD).Happy hunting!",Gladiator
1193,Ironclad,"History isn't so boring after all, now is it?",10,5 May 2000,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film!  This film was filled with pleasant surprises: from the grand cinematography, action, gore, special effects, to the plot itself, and the great support cast, including Derek Jacobi and Richard Harris.  As a historian, there were a few minor things I could quibble about, such as some of the armour used was clearly from a later period, such as that used in the Crusades, and even spied a Viking Helmet from the era of Canute.  That and the prescence of a Sinaloan Milksnake(indigenous to the western hemisphere), crawling in bed with someone.....a presumed victim of a harmless snake...The only other criticism was that to make the evil Commodus even more despicable, they had to throw in an implied incest scene to villify him more.  But still, Commodus was never as vile and clearly insane as Gaius Caligula.I also liked it when the emperor was telling stories about Claudius...who was played so effectively in the series ""I Claudius"" by Derek Jacobi....who did a nice job playing a senator in this film.Otherwise, I thought it was a fantastic film, and I plan to go back and see it again!",Gladiator
1194,DeirdreoftheSorrows,"Just wonderful, had every thing you could want from a movie.",10,6 January 2001,"This has got to be one of the best. This film contained everything that one would go to a cinema for. The story line was fairly simple, but so well done. The cast suited the roles , the acting was excellent and the cinematography was wonderful. What can be said that hasn't already? This is a film I'd watch again and again and again..........",Gladiator
1195,Gallus,Historical Baloney,4,1 July 2000,"For those who may care : this movie is historical baloney, pure and simple. It is true that, in the late 2nd century of our era, there was a wise Roman philosopher-emperor named Marcus Aurelius whom the unfortunate circumstances of his time forced to wage incessant wars on Germanic tribes and that, after his death, near the front, he was succeeded by his son Commodus, a madman who fancied himself the incarnation of Hercules and often performed in the arena. But the connection stops there, and that is a pity, for the true facts of CommodusÕ reign, which lasted some 15 years (A.D. 177-192), would probably have made a much better story than what we have here.As for Maximus, he is a pure invention. The only character by that name in that period of Roman imperial history is the young son and heir of the short-lived emperor Maximinus Thrax (A.D. 235-238). There are, it is true, some similarities between the career of that Maximinus and that the fictional Maximus, for Maximinus was both some kind of a muscle-man and a good general, who won many victories on the German front. However, when you read more about him, you also find out that he was also a brutal tyrant who enjoyed killing large number of people, when he was not busy dispatching bulls with his bare hands - his favourite past-time... (I could never quite understand why Hollywood feels the need to change the facts of history when they are so sensational!)Tons of money were poured into the making of GLADIATOR, and one wishes that the producers would have made better use of those resources. The sets are impressive, but hardly accurate - except for the reconstruction of the Colosseum, which corresponds more or less to the current scholarly consensus on what that extraordinary building looked like. (Notice the awnings on the top-tier. Their purpose was to provide shade to the audience. It is only recently that scholars have begun to work out the complex details of their structure and operation.) But the Roman skyline, full of elegant fluted domes, is all wrong. That is the skyline of SEVENTEENTH CENTURY Rome, as rebuilt by the Renaissance popes and their successors. In ancient Rome, the only large domed building was the Pantheon,  which survives, and it did not at all look like that. Also, as anyone who has been there will tell you, Rome is located in hilly, not mountainous, country.They also botched their Marcus Aurelius. Richard Harris is a fine actor, but a bit old for the part and there is a big problem with his hair, which is long and straight, whereas the hair of Marcus Aurelius, whose features immortalized on his coins are familiar to anyone who knows anything about Roman history, was short and curly. That may sound like an insignificant detail, but it would be like making a film of the life of Adolf Hitler and forget the moustache... For a spitting image of Marcus Aurelius, check Alec Guinness in THE FALL OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE.In my opinion, the best, and perhaps only true good, moment in GLADIATOR is the impressive opening sequence, a graphic illustration of the kind of ruthless and savage campaigns which the Roman emperors of the period had to wage over and over again to stem the barbarian tide on their Danubian border.The rest of the movie is only slightly better than mediocre, with Derek Jacobi looking like if he were a guilty man, very embarrassed to be there and very anxious to take his money and run. I am sure that many people will disagree with that harsh assessment, for this film has clearly been designed as an audience-pleaser.To those interested in more than well-packaged trash, I suggest to go to the nearest video store and rent a copy of Stanley KubrickÕs SPARTACUS, a vastly superior gladiator film, and one that will give you a remarkably accurate sense of the greatness that was Rome, Çan eternal thought in the mind of GodÈ.",Gladiator
1196,ck-21,Best movie of the summer,10,7 September 2000,"I was reticent about seeing this movie - I thought it was just going to be another slashem/hackem macho movie. But from the opening sequence in Germania to the end, I was caught up in the film completely. Russel Crowe was marvellous as a simple man who just wanted to do his job and go home. Joaquin Phoenix was vile and despicable as Commodus, but surprisingly sympathetic - one pitied as well as hated him. Derek Jacobi was a perfect touch for those of us who learned of the machinations of Roman politics with I, Claudius and Oliver Reed went out with a great performance. The initial battle portrays the domination of the Roman army perfectly. The combat sequences were the right balance of blood and skill but the director did not focus on gore in graphic slow-motion detail which would have bogged the movie down. Even the music was well done, although I think Mr. Zimmer should have acknowledged the influence of Holst's 'The Planets'. An excellent production altogether. I'll definitely purchase it when it's available.",Gladiator

I studied Rome back at school for 7 years and was very pleased when I heard that they had made a ""sandal and sword"" epic in my time, as opposed to Ben Hur and Spartacus which were made way before me.Having studied Rome for so many years, I had so many images in my head as to what it would have been like. This film turns those images into reality. Russell Crowe was perfectly cast as the vengeful Maximus. He was really menacing and you could tell that his character had a huge chip on his shoulder (which wasn't surprising since his family had been murdered at the bequest of the Roman emperor, Commodus,, who was now Maximus' enemy). Joaquin Phoenix was great (but a bit hammy!) as the 19 year old emperor. Oliver Reed turned in a sterling performance. This film is a fitting tribute to his memory.      ""Gladiator"" is great entertainment with battle scene after battle scene, wowing you at every turn, dispersed by golden shots of an age-old Rome. You will not be disappointed.",Gladiator

He Escapes, and becomes a Gladiator, leading to a nasty showdown with Commodus, now emperor.

I must say the visuals were spectacular.  Seeing Rome in all of its greyish-brown glory is quite magnificent.  I think Ebert trashed it for the monotonous colour scheme but IMHO, this adds to the feeling of actually being there.Russell Crowe has been in a couple of really great movies over the last few years: The Insider (also very long :)) and L.A.

The movie is the Private Ryan of roman times. If this movie had made in those times it would have had the same affect Ryan had on this society. It showed us that battle is not always a noble thing.In my view this movie is not as good as Conan if you want to see great Fighting scenes but, if we are rating it by that it is the second best after Conan the barbarian.

My expectations were raised repeatedly, as the first and second trailers plus the glowing recommendations of friends who'd seen it equaled the possibility of a huge disappointment.Thankfully, the work of Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe and others did not let this moviegoer down. While the plot was good and well done, Gladiator's strength lies in its great battle sequences. You want blood? You got it. You want guts? You got it. These battles are some of the best I've ever seen on film.A certain MTV Movie Awards winner for Best Fight Sequence... the hard part will be deciding which battle to pick.While the battle sequences will be the number one topic of discussion as you're walking out of the theater, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the great performances from the main actors. I doubt Crowe has ever been better, there's a good chance you'll be chanting his name along with the crowd during the Coliseum scenes. Probably not Oscar-worthy, but you never know... Joaquin Phoenix deserves some recognition as well, he makes a good villain. From the moment he arrives on screen, the audience immediately hates his guts. By the time that these two finally meet, you'll want to see Phoenix get what's coming to him quite badly.A great movie, the best I've seen this year (so far), and a certain DVD purchase in the winter.

Russell Crowe answers the age old question ""what do women want""...  a man of honor, strength, integrity, intelligence, with a light in his eyes and passion in his heart. The violence is real enough to be taken seriously, but the film does not linger or wallow over it. While much has been made by some critics about how audiences cheer the violence in the Coliseum, they/we are also cheering the clear underdogs, fighting for survival in a world not of their own making. When Maximus wins against the odds, and still shows honor and mercy, he is a hero well worth cheering.  I was struck by the similarities to a hero in our own day.

1208,Brest,Masterful entertainment: 85% epic 15% history for the new-comer star Crowe.,8,22 May 2000,"This must be a nostalgic time. After the highly old-fashioned Mission to Mars (questionable but fascinating, and not as ugly as seen by most reviewers), here comes `Gladiator', a piece of cinema which refers directly to the righteously quoted milestones of the genre (Ben Hur and Spartacus). Engaged in the most expensive production of his life, Ridley Scott proved himself, again, at ease in creating deep impact visual scenery. The rules of entertainment force him to go very shallow with historic context and motivation: what counts here is to see an epical hero regain his dignity and obtain is vengeance in a world of hardly conceivable brutality.The highest point of the whole movie is the fast yet sharp description of Maximus as a `Homo Pius': it happens when he prays for protection and good advice in front of the small images portraying his family and his ancestors, and even more when, during the movie, those little stones become symbols of love-beyond-the-life of a simple family man. This is typical RS cinema's blueprint: the depiction of a weak and lonely hero, carrying on the burden of loyalty and honor and the trembling light of Reason in a world of cruelty and darkness (see for reference The Duellists, Blade Runner, Black Rain, 1992: The Conquest of Paradise). As simple and almost simplistic this scheme may seem, RS is in perfect command of the matter as he tells this story staged at the sunset of the Roman Imperial era: the opening battle sequence is shorter but more effective than the Bravehearts' ones, and the `ludi circenses' in a stunningly realistic Coliseum are powerful and convincing.Many have complained about the mistakes in historical and especially linguistic details (for an Italian, who has studied Latin in high school, it is painful to notice it: would it have been too expensive to hire a Latin language consultant?): I think that they are almost inevitable in a production of such a complexity, and you better not look, in a movie, for something that you should find in a good book of history. All in all: Gladiator is a nostalgic and masterful piece of entertainment, in which glows the vague hallmark of an authentic `auteur', even if this latter is deeply compromised with the dirty Hollywood money.Ah, and don't worry about strict historical accuracy: Hollywood is as likely to produce a perfectly faithful Roman movie, as it is the rest of the World to produce any Roman movie at all.",Gladiator
1209,Keith Loh,Excellent production lacking passion,8,29 April 2000,"Gladiator is worth seeing more than once just to take in the historical detail, the awesome use of CGI to portray a world long gone, and for good performances by Russell Crowe, Richard Harris, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen and the late Oliver Reed. Fans of battle scenes and history should flock to see the nice illusion of authenticity that director Ridley Scott weaves here, which promises to bring back the golden days of the historical epic. It lacks, however, an essential passion that drives each character. On the surface, Russell Crowe seems to have many motivations, revenge for one. He glowers through this entire movie. Yet I did not feel much rage between he and his nemesis, Commodus, as the story dwelled more on the politics between the Senate and the Republic, important historically, but not developed here in terms of a human story that had meaning to the common person or to the characters involved. This is a typical Ridley Scott movie. An impeccable production without a centre.",Gladiator
1210,dorthul,"Disappointing...no, I wasn't expecting much.",4,24 May 2000,"I am glad that I did not have high hopes for this movie, since I then would have been greatly disappointed. I expected a no-plot action movie with a good actor - Russell Crowe. I was right. The plot is weak and very unoriginal. Everything about the plot wreaks of banality, since there are no original ideas introduced into this film.I find Russell Crowe a good actor - believable, and able to provoke sympathy. This film provides a lot of star status, but little acting potential, besides the disgusted looks when he gores someone with a spear, or the moments of pain when he finds his wife and child murdered.Commodus is a completely overplayed villain. The film tries so hard to make him seem evil (using all the bad-guy tactics) that it just gets old.Special effects were mediocre, although they were hard to discern due to the poor lighting throughout the movie. Rather than be given a chance to appreciate some of the tactics and maneuvers of the gladiators, we were thrown into a jumble of random fights that did nothing but confuse.How this movie can be given an average vote of 8.5 on IMDB is unbelievable. I suggest that those voting actually watch the movie rather than marvelingat the blood and armor.",Gladiator

Russle Crow gives a fantastic performace as Maximus, and was completly believeable.  However one thing stood out.  Joaquin Phoenix.  Was he like the newphew of the director or somthing.  He was terrible in the role. Every scene he came on i couldnt help bury my head in my hands.

That's why my vote is casted to Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.",Gladiator
1213,drjhcrow,'Bloody and the Beast' entertaining action for those in need of a killing frenzy.,8,5 May 2000,"Lots of very exciting action.  Generally good story line until the total collapse at the end.  And I thought only the French did not know how to finish a movie!  Forget about the end and you're on.  General is victorious ... betrayed by jealous heir to Caesar ... escapes death ... somehow winds up a gladiator (super gladiator) ... goes to Rome... drives his betrayer (new Caesar) crazy ... wins big at killing and becomes a superstar ... new Caesar's sister betrays Caesar for gladiator (sounds real to me!) ... from here the story line goes south. 
Basically this is a revenge story with terrific action and some stars that make the movie fun.  Russell Crowe, as Maximus the gladiator, is a terrific presence on screen.  His only weak lines were with Caesar Senior (Richard Harris who looks like he has just about recovered from the beating in ""The Unforgiven"") when he is describing his home.  Crowe just could not do those lines.  No one could do those lines!  Elsewhere, Crowe is the gladiator! What a killer!  Crowe looks perfect in this rugged, physical role and he has a very good voice.  Joaquin Phoenix as Caesar Junior is fantastic as a disgusting figure.  He was nervously sexual around his sister, played by Connie Nielsen.  He definitely convinced me that he was unstable.  Nielsen is a real beauty and gave a strong performance - where has she been?  Oliver Reed was pretty good as the master of the gladiators.  This part lacked consistent definition.  I think that Reed needed to be cruel and money driven from start to finish.  What other kind of person could run a gladiator slave operation?The scenery, clothing, and hardware are outstanding.Flaws and all, I liked the movie because the good parts and good scenes carry the imagination along quite well.

All my friends were very anxious to see one more swashbuckling epic from one of Hollywood's most respected directors, Mr. Ridley Scott. I was too because the Roman Empire is one my favorite subject since I was in high school. But ""Gladiator"" is not a Roman Empire epic, it's just a action-packed movie, with some lame love scenes and one more crazy Roman Emperor in the middle of the mess (Commodus, a routine and unimaginative performance by Phoenix). The direction is heavy, dull and without flavour. Crowe who is now saluted as the most proeminent name in Hollywood nowadays seems to me not so good in fact.

Good cast next to Crowe who really surprises everybody concerning his art of changing his roles so dramatically (e.g. ""Insider"").

Russel Crowe gave an intense and convincing performance. My only complaint is that the movie seemed at times like an unofficial sequel to 'Braveheart' as it concentrated on the same idea of a would be farmer whose revenge inspires him to fight for the good of his people.

It has stunning action sequences (such as the initial battle scene), incredible visual effects, and a gripping, interesting story.  Crowe does an excellent job, but Phoenix, as Commodus, is the one who probably deserves the biggest applause.  And the computer-generated reconstruction of the city of Rome at the peak of the Roman Empire's grandeur is simply breathtaking!
I would say this is one of the best movies ever... if it wasn't for the ending.  The little speech that Lucilla gives after the final fight between Commodus and Maximus was the downpoint of the movie - it is so typical of big Hollywood studios to insert a final ""message"" by a character as a learning point of the movie.  This movie does not need any messages or learning points: they are very evident.  The final speech takes away all of the excitement from the recently-finished fight, and all grandeur from Crowe's character, since Lucilla steals the end.

1222,norwood34,"Brilliantly Acted, Very Entertaining",10,27 July 2002,"Russell Crowe earned his Oscar for his portrayal of Maximus, and it had nothing to do with the fact that he didn't win for The Insider.  His performance in Gladiator is absolutely flawless.  I can't imagine anybody else playing Maximus.  This was my first time seeing Russell, and now he is my favorite actor.If I had to describe Russell's performance in one word, it would be `subtle.'  Less is more.  Joel Siegel, the film critic on `Good Morning America,' said `Russell Crowe is not an action star, but he is such a great actor he makes you believe he is an action star.'  Joel is missing the point.  The LAST thing this movie needs is an action star!  The role of Maximus required an actor who could convey all the facets of Maximus' personality and emotions.  He also needed to look good in a tunic and perform convincingly in the action scenes.  Russell combines all the necessary qualities and looks gorgeous.  I can't praise his performance enough.  Russell always holds your attention and makes himself clear, but always in a very subtle way.  He is never flashy or exaggerated.  He conveys Maximus' dignity, intelligence, courage, intensity, warmth, sense of humor, and all his other qualities.  He is also totally believable in the action scenes.All the performances in this movie are excellent.  Joaquin Phoenix should have won the Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Commodus. Connie Nielsen (Lucilla) has real chemistry with Russell.
The soundtrack by Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is magnificent and should have won the Oscar.I also have a couple of minor complaints about the movie.The cinematography in the beginning of the movie is awful.  I know they wanted us to understand that Germania is cold, but it was not necessary to photograph those scenes in such a way that everything is tinted blue.  It just looks wrong.  The actors have blue faces and the costumes look dull and washed out.  The scene in which Maximus walks out of Marcus Aurelius' (Richard Harris) tent and meets Lucilla is the most egregious.The writing leaves something to be desired.  When Commodus discovers that Maximus is alive, he says `They lied to me...They told me he was dead.' But there was nobody left alive!

1223,IAM_AMI,All time Classic !!!!,9,3 May 2019,"One of those all time classics that reshaped the genre when it was all but dead. Crowe is splendid in the lead role and commands the screen in a role he was born to play. Ridley Scott returns to form after a few films fail to find critical or financial success. The film swept the box office and awards so, the film plays out like an artistic big budget passion of love. This is one film I haven't tired from after all these years and have just recently experienced the extended cut, I think studios should allow 3 hour films as a standard practice. I cannot fault what I might even call my favourite film of all time.",Gladiator
1224,colin-deshong,You'll Never Forget This Movie!,10,13 May 2006,"Gladiator, by far, is the most exceptional movie to date that I've seen, and probably Russell Crowe's best performance.The movie, taking place in Rome shortly after the reign of Scipio, and the barbarian Hannibal, instantly captivates you in the intro with an exploding scene that will leave you speechless.Immediately you think that the movie will be just a bloodbath and without a true meaning, but Ripley Scott delivers a much more powerful message! Maximus Decimus Meridius, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, overpowers the emperor of Rome, and sets an inspiring finale. Words cannot describe the impact you'll receive from watching this movie to it's entirety! With an amazing ending, a detailed, yet interesting storyline, Gladiator keeps you moving and excited all the way through, and ultimately can end with viewers in tears. A beautiful ending! My favorite movie by far!",Gladiator

Maximus escapes his execution, but finds his wife and child murdered. Wandering and wounded near death, he is picked up and put into slavery, and selected to fight for sport as a gladiator. From there, he seeks revenge.While it's all grand opera, and driven by sweeping gestures and pompous, overwritten dialogue, it is prone to plain silliness - especially in granting us the big showdown at the close. But the sheer dynamism of the action, coupled with Hans Zimmer's lavish score and the forcefield of Crowe, still makes this a fierce-some competitor as one of the best historic films in recent memory.",Gladiator

Excellent performance of the duo, trying to overcome the other in and out the movie, always with these words to count for.
I wouldn't rate this a straight 10, since in my opinion, the trama could be more developed around his vengeance and could have take another way that would be interesting to see.

1228,kentuckyblackbird,worth another look,3,7 December 2007,"Everyone seems to have an affinity for this film. Maybe I prejudged it and did not go in with an open, or even a slanted mind. I look at the background images on the screen as much as I look at the main characters in the foreground. The cinema was impressive as well as the timing from scene to scene. Maybe, just maybe, I missed something important in this film, prompting me to give it a negative critique. However, I will never change my opinion of the impossible story line.

1230,austin6174,"Great Special Effects, OK Movie.",8,16 June 2001,"Gladiator is one of those movies where you just know what's going to happen next. After returning from war, Maximus (Russell Crowe) is to be given the crown as emperor of Rome, but instead is sent to be executed once the Emperor's son (Joaquin Phoenix) kills the emperor and takes it for himself. After escaping execution and winding up a slave and a gladiator, you just know how the movie is going to go. While the scenery and battle sequences are great, the predictability and general lack of caring about most of the characters makes this a rather unspectacular movie. Crowe does a decent, but not Oscar-worthy job of portraying Maximus while Phoenix does an equally decent job as portraying the evil, self-centered emperor Commodus. No one else in the cast is really given all that much for character depth and thus I never really cared about most of them. I give the movie 9/10 stars for the special effects and 7/10 for everything else, averaging an 8/10 for the movie.",Gladiator

Perhaps I just don't enjoy revenge fantasies.  Anyway, I couldn't help watching this and thinking ""Russell Crowe really deserved the Oscar for 'The Insider', not this piece of Hollywood pap.""

1232,taishi81,A movie that will not be remembered 20 years from now as a great film,6,10 July 2001,"I love good action films, the kind that entertain and enthrall, and every once in a while leave a viewer in awe. I love gladiator movies. Since childhood, I have been a fan of swordfighting and swashbuckling melodramas, as most young boys are. There is nothing wrong with the fun in them, because every once in while a great one like ""Spartacus"" and ""Braveheart"" comes along, a truly epic film that not only pierces the eye, but the imagination as well. Those films were not just spectacle, but had real heart in them. They contained stories that worked with enough good writing and direction to move beyond just a popcorn flick. The film ""Gladiator"" did not. I know people love this film, that even many critics called it a wonderful success. In that light, I tried hard to like it. I sat down twice in the theater and once at home to give it an honest look, but sadly, a new revelation never came. At best, it is just an action flick, and since I love these types of movies so much, that label saddens me all the more.Here is my argument. Many claim that the action scenes were the best they had seen. I thought those claims were simply caught up in the flashy technique that was used, but not the resulting experience. Director Ridley Scott used quick cuts and blurry hand-held camera work to film the fighting scenes, copying much of the same style that Spielberg introduced in ""Saving Private Ryan""'s opening sequence. It places the viewer almost inside the battle with the same kind of confusion that a soldier might feel. All fine and dandy in a modern battle that uses guns and explosives, weapons that require little skill to use or watch on screen, but in mid-evil warfare, I would like to actually see and understand the fighting with swords that takes a focused camera to capture. It can be done. ""Braveheart"" gave scenes just as strong in action, and much more understandable. those scenes were enthralling, and are still the standard in my opinion. Sadly, every action scene in this movie was much the same: blurry, quick cutting, not easy to understand, and therefore not easy to enjoy. I wanted to scream at the screen ""Just let me watch the fighting!!!"" This movie was not trying to make some great statement about war or its time, like the Spielberg film, and therefore did not need to go all artistic for not reason at the moment the crowd is supposed to sit back and enjoy the ride. Since the action let me down so much, it was now the job of the plot to pull me along.There were many things that worked in this film concerning the plot. The actors were very good, particularly Richard Harris in the beginning as Caesar. Many scenes worked by themselves, but did not really add up to a complete picture. Often I felt like the characters were acting a particular way not because the story had given them any real motivation to, but because the plot required it for the moment. When Maximus was needed to be mad, or noble, or depressed, or vengeful, or hopeful, or hopeless, he simply was. The man was a rollercoaster of emotion in this film, but his reason for being such was not consistantly shown. A plot cannot drive the characters, it must be driven by them and what they would actually do if they existed. While it was all handled well by Russel Crowe, a fine actor, it made me feel manipulated as the viewer.Overall, it was a popcorn flick, a movie to entertain, but to challenge, and certainly not to win an Academy Award, the worst presented in years. The special effects were very noticable, made so to appear ""wowing"", but they detracted from the reality instead of enhancing it. I do not understand why people think ""Gladiator"" is greater than it is, a movie that will not be remembered 20 years from now as a great film, unlike other films that were nominated right along side of it.",Gladiator

Unfortunately, it all goes downhill from there. It isn't the performers faults since every single one of them give amazing, emotional, even, at times, riveting performances (the kinds you should find in better movies) and who give the whole picture more class than it deserves. It isn't Hanz Zimmer's nor Lisa Gerrard's fault since they have composed a score that's almost (and I do mean almost) as unforgettable as the Godfather's. And it certainly isn't Ridely Scott's fault since he yet again succeeds in immersing the audience in the world he has created. No, the ones who are to blame are the people who wrote the saccharine, clichéd, soap-opery script and who, in the process, have wasted all of this incredible talent. They should be fed to the lions.

Still, did we have to witness a  grinning seven year old boy being trampled ruthlessly by horsemen? Did we have to hear the line ""They tell me your son squealed like a girl as he was nailed to the cross, and that your wife moaned like a whore as she was ravaged over... and over... and over again?"" Thank you, Ridley Scott.It's sad that people are so casually able to dismiss stomach-churning moments such as these in the film...for what? For a supposed hero's hollow 'vengeance' that may or may not ever come to fruition? For Russell Crowe's rugged (cough) good looks? Whatever the reason, it's bad enough that the average audience continues to have such a fascination with 'bloodlust', but that gratuitous violence towards children (even though fictionalized) now passes as part of the overall entertainment package...what does that say about us as a society?",Gladiator
1242,darkmedia,"Gladiator, 2000",9,28 August 2010,"This movie is near-perfect. When we watch a movie, more then often it relies on other factors, for example violence, or crude humour to weave the plot, or simply to entertain. Not often are we allowed to watch a simple movie, told simply and yet beneath the story we get a sense of something immense and complex.Gladiator, told simply, is a film surrounding Maximus Merridius Decimus, a general who becomes greatly acquainted with the emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Upon Marcus' dying wish he wants Rome to become a republic and entrusts Maximus to the task. Commodus, the Emperors son is deeply wounded by Marcus' father treatment to Maximus and seeks revenge. What continues is a beautiful told story of friendship, jealousy and anger. What I love about this film is that it centers around Maximus/Commodus and doesn't center around the violence of the arena. This movie is, fictional - it is made to entertain and it does so, it is not a real account and should be watched open-minded. I highly recommend this film to anyone, the only criticism of this film that I can give is the first battle scene which is unfortunately a little strange, but the rest is...****1/2 out of *****",Gladiator

1244,RealtorMatthew,Perfection in movie-making,10,9 May 2011,"There are some movies that move your spirit in an indescribable way - a way that makes you look at life differently. A way that causes you to not take your loved ones for granted, ever. Gladiator is such a movie.Gladiator is one of those movies that is the ultimate version of good versus evil. In one corner you are cheering on the protagonist, and the other your skin crawls when you see the villain.Probably Russell Crowe's finest performance, Gladiator brings us back during the time when the Roman empire was at its peak. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is the leader of the army and has just come off of a major victory. His desire is to return to his family, but Caesar's son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) has other plans for him - to continue to lead Rome as a world superpower. Where there opinions differ is in the rule - Commodus in an emperor and Maximus believes it should be given to the people The rest of the story involves Commodus's attempts to destroy Maximus because of his ""betrayal"" to the Roman empire. Maximus becomes traded as a slave and is forced to fight in Gladiator wars, which frequently result in death.The scene in the movie where I felt the most tension was when Commodus confronted his father about a particular issue.During this time Maximus forges a few strong relationships with his cell-mates and becomes a symbol of perseverence.Maximus is bold,courageous, and never backs down. My favorite quote from the movie is ""What we do while alive echoes in eternity."" Lots of great quotes throughout the movie.The music is incredible and earned an Academy Award nomination. I would describe it as being hauntingly beautiful. The scenery is breathtakingly exquisite and gives us a good idea of what it looked like at the time The cinematography is probably the best I've seen, in particular during the Gladiator fight scenes. These scenes also got my adrenaline pumping, while anxiously watching to see who would die next.The final scene of the movie is simply stunning and moving, a fitting end for a film of this magnitude.As I can't think of one thing to change, my movie review for Gladiator is 10/10 stars.",Gladiator
1245,cordedpoodle,Spoiler but read it anyway. You'll be glad you did.,3,23 June 2005,"Warning Spoiler,,,,It's hard to believe that this bomb gets such high ratings. 1) Wooden acting and dialogue. 2) The MTV 'fast cut"" photography does nothing to enhance the movie. It's merely a FAD promulgated by no talent camera people who substitute faddish standards when they can't think clearly or creatively. 3) Scott treats Maximus and Marcus Aurelius like they are noble characters, with corny swelling music. Instead of what they were. Vicious, ruthless creeps on par with the worst of the Nazis.4) Now to the worst part and the spoiler. Even if you've disagreed with the former you have to agree with this. This movie wants us to believe that Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) would put Maximus (Russell Crowe) into slavery because he threatens Commodus's chances of being the Emperor. He lets him live so he has a chance to come back and threaten later. Duh! Yeah that makes sense. He kills Maximus's wife & kid though. C'mon! Any dufus dictator would have just executed him plain and simple.Then we are supposed to believe that Maximus rises to the top of the gladiatorial thingee far enough that he becomes a hero gladiator. Again. Duh! Commodus would allow this? Double Duh! Now the crowning blow to credulity. We are supposed to believe that the wimpy Emperor would be STUPID enough to climb down into the arena and fight the buff, tough, well trained killer Maximus.How stupid can movie goers and reviewers get? Pretty damn stupid I guess judging from the reviews here. Not all of us are fooled though.The real tragedy is that within the story of Rome are countless compelling stories. Truth is way more interesting than this kind of contrived fiction. A real movie about real life Romans would have been far more interesting. Romans were like us. Their rulers were lazy, corrupt, ignorant, egotistical and horribly brutish. They had slavery like us, conquered like us, maintained a republic for 200 years, like us, until they capitulated to a dictator and a dictatorship in the name of security, which I hope we avoid. The Romans were masters of self delusion and deliberate ignorance of the society they created.Spartacus, of course, comes to mind. The way that Kubrick explored the inner decay and fear of Laurence Olivier's Marcus twisted Licinius Crassus was brilliant to say the least. On the surface Crassus is genteel, educated, brilliant, but on the inside... Crassus kills HIS gladiator the way a real Roman Emperor would, after he is wounded, near death and no threat. He kills him in fear, cowardly, with a knife to the throat. He desperately wants Livia's love but doesn't know why or even what love is. He will never know love. He is obsessed with her indifference because it threatens his self deluded image of his own superiority. Rising to become the most powerful person in Rome he's really a pathetic shell of a human being terrified to confront his humanity. So pathetic he is worthy of pity from his slave.There is nothing in this film that even comes close. Its all flash over substance and not even great flash. The tension and anticipatory horror in final battle scene in Spartacus is palpable. We feel it the same as the rebels feel it. We are small and vulnerable in the coming gigantic battle. We feel their fear but we also know they are ready to die free because the alternative is worse. We are with them in spirit because we ARE them. We fear the Romans but we also hate their decadence and lack of decency and what they will do to our families. We may die but we are going to take down as many of them as we can.In Gladiator we are treated like dumb observers who can't think for ourselves. We are marks who are stupid enough to pay the admission price. We ARE the observers in the coliseum, lazy, corrupt, ignorant, decadent, stupidly accepting a absurd plot.",Gladiator

The Colosseum was wonderfully reanimated. Also the actors/actress were very well casted. Crowe as Maximus gave one of the best performances of his acting career I think an Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus was very good at making me hate him.Gladiator is a film that brings us to our feet. When Crowe's character Maxumus says the line about his son and mother you cant help but cheer him on. This film is a film that gives meaning to film making.

1248,strikerman,Everybody has to love this movie,10,22 December 2008,"Yesterday I saw this masterpiece for the third time, but I was tremendously impressed again like I have ever been when I have watched it.Maximus, a highly decorated commander of the Roman Legions and friend of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, wins the most important battle against the Teutons and is now looking forward to spend his evening of live with his wife and son in his homeland Spain, but Marcus Aurelius wants him to be his successor.Commodus, Marcus' son, who recognized his father's plans, kills his father and appoints himself as the new Ceasar. Maximus, who is able to escape from the execution, ordered by Commodus, manages to come home, but his family is already killed by Roman troops.Maximus now becomes a gladiator and after several wins he cut's his way to the Colosseum, where he meets his archenemy Commodus. He reveals his identity to Commodus and is now the idol of the people in contrast to Commodus who is hated by them.Commodus knows he cannot murder Maximus, because that would make Maximus a martyr no more than to let him alive. The only possibility is a hand-to-hand fight against Maximus in the Colosseum. And of course Maximus wins, but is terribly hurt. In the last moments of his life he gives the power back to the Senate and dies in the arena so he is now reunited with his family.The movie contains everything which a good monumental film needs, action scenes, intrigues and a heroic epic.Russel Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix, two of the best Hollywood actors, have done an excellent job. Crowe has played the role of his life.What makes this movie special is Maximus' live journey which is characterized of ups and downs. Everybody can identify himself with Maximus. Everyone shares the thrill with him that he kill the hated Commodus (excellentely played by Phoenix) and that he cares for justice.

1255,imdbunit-42945,Roman history,10,19 October 2018,"A very memorable and remarkable way to show roman history. The story and names were fictious in comparison to Roman history however the movie made a remarkable approach to its audience and made them believe that its a true story of Roman empire.On May 5, 2000, Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe unveiled their R-rated Roman epic, Gladiator, in theaters nationwide. The film claimed five Oscars at the 73rd Academy Awards, including best picture. The Hollywood Reporter's original review is below.Emphasizing brawn over brain and spectacle over intimacy, Ridley Scott's Gladiator nevertheless is an impressive accomplishment in its re-creation not only of the golden age of the Roman Empire but of the unspeakable brutality with which one of the world's greatest states conducted its business.Following up on his recent best actor Oscar nomination, Russell Crowe solidly anchors this epic-scale gladiator movie - the first in nearly four decades - by using his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics. A guy's guy, but one who should have considerable appeal for women as well, Crowe will be a major factor in the worldwide success of this ultimate jock movie from DreamWorks and Universal.
Like the Caesars, who commanded vast armies and ruled much of the world's population, Scott marshals the resources of a cast of thousands, colossal sets, exquisite costuming and graphic imaging to paint in the details of a credible though sometimes geographically confusing depiction of the Roman Empire.Although the physically daunting production at times threatens to overwhelm the implausible tale, Crowe and several actors, most notably the late Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen and, in an extended cameo, Richard Harris, never let the human dimension get lost.The screenplay, originally written by David Franzoni (Amistad) with John Logan and William Nicholson apparently doing rewrites, formulates a startlingly simplistic good-vs.-evil scenario. It also asks an audience to swallow the idea of Rome's greatest general becoming almost overnight a slave and then a gladiator. Then again, in the second century of the Christian era, the Empire was a pretty crazy place and anything could, and did, happen.The movie opens as Crowe's General Maximus undertakes the final battle of his three-year campaign in the northernmost reaches of the Empire. ""At my signal,"" he tells his aides, ""unleash hell."" And hell it is. Scott treats us to a striking display of warfare A.D. 180-style. The ancient killing machines swing into action: Thousands of spears and flaming arrows pierce the air, catapults fling fiery clay pots against flammable trees, hand-to-hand combat entails broadswords and axes, and a flanking maneuver led by Maximus himself sees the cavalry slip behind enemy lines to finish off the outmanned resistance.In this early sequence, Scott signals the scope and scale of his ambitions, painting a broad canvas of blood, valor and horror, where action is slowed down to create a blur of shade and color, an impressionistic chiaroscuro of maniacal madness.As the smoke of battle drafts away, the movie's main characters are revealed. The dying emperor himself is unaccountably on hand, the white-manned Marcus Aurelius (Harris in a role John Huston would have played 20 years before). Waxing philosophical about a rule where virtue and wisdom is overshadowed by constant warfare, Marcus lays bare his unhappiness about the corruption of Rome.He informs Maximus, his wastrel though ambitious son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and his much wiser daughter Lucilla (Nielsen) of his intention to pass over his son to appoint Maximus as Protector of Rome. However, Commodus makes certain the old man dies before those wishes are widely known. He declares himself emperor before the body is cold, then orders Maximus' immediate death.Escaping execution, Maximus makes his way seemingly overnight - locations are vague throughout - to his home, where he finds his wife and son hideously crucified. Gravely injured himself, he falls into the hands of a slaver, Proximo (Reed), who turns him into a gladiator along with fellow slave Juba (Djimon Hounsou).Meanwhile, Commodus, implausibly unaware of Maximus' survival, arrives in triumph back in Rome where he indulges himself in all kinds of villainies. To take the populace's minds off his evil designs, he restores the gladiator games to the capital.Soon enough, Maximus, who has covered himself in glory in games in the provinces, gets called up to the big leagues. Arriving in Rome, he aims to achieve greatness in the arena, win the hearts of Romans and challenge the emperor himself, the man he has vowed to destroy.Neither Scott nor his writers seem the least put off by the flatness of this moral universe. Crowe's warrior embodies all that is good in the Roman ideal - where strength is found in honor and one remains loyal to a higher morality than political power. Phoenix's tyrant, on the other hand, is a sniveling and indolent punk, snarling his every line of dialogue and incapable of even the slightest glimpse of anything reflecting his noble lineage.To drive home Commodus' tyranny, his entry into Rome is accompanied by monochromatic shots of the pageantry that ape those in Leni Riefenstahl's Nazi propaganda classic Triumph of the Will. Scott thereby ensures his audience always understands where the moral center lies. But some of the fun drains out of the movie when its makers resort to caricature over character.Nielsen's Lucilla is more confusing than complex, seemingly allied with her brother but emotionally pulled toward Maximus, with whom she once had a romantic dalliance that left them both bitter. But Nielsen delivers a character whose contradictions stem from not only divided loyalties but a moral inheritance from her father.Reed's ex-gladiator-turned-slaver emerges as one of the film's more interesting figures, a man of practicality who, as practical men are often wont to do, proves to be a man of more honor than one might initially think.But it is Crowe who dominates, a sexy and decisive man of action, bloodied but never bowed. Crowe is one of the most watchable of movie actors, fast on his way to becoming a movie star.Arthur Max's sets recreate a splendid Rome, though some CGI shots of the afterlife, which figures prominently in Maximus' inner life, are too contemporary looking to jibe with the ancient world. Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard's music catches the ominous majesty of the cruel Empire. John Mathieson's camera is never showy yet always in the right place to catch the action. The stunt work is thrilling, an unimaginable choreography of men, weapons, chariots and wild animals down to the smallest details.The movie is impressive in scope, but like the gladiator games themselves, designed for mindless spectacle to please the multitudes.",Gladiator
1256,Zaphoid-2,"Ummmm... ""Wow!""",10,10 May 2000,"When I went to see this film, I wasn't sure what to expect... I'd seen Russell Crowe in ""The Insider"" only a few weeks ago, and I can't believe he is the same person that starred in this film! I think ""The Insider"" and ""Gladiator"" really show Crowe's depth as an actor. Playing two totally different roles with totally different challenges equally well.
Crowe's magnificent performance aside, the entire film was shot on a glorious canvas, and despite the fact that I saw it in a theatre that was lacking surround sound and high quality picture, it was a visually stunning film to watch, and I can imagine it as a film that would truely benefit from a good screen and good sound...The supporting cast was excellent all around, and Ridley Scott has proven once again he is a master at his craft. I can see a spate of Oscar(tm) nominations from this film, and it richly deserves them. I will be looking for this film to buy in DVD when it's released...",Gladiator
1257,Giac,Gladiator - simply a terrible movie (SPOILERS),2,8 May 2000,"I must admit that I'm very surprised at how highly everyone seems to regard the movie ""Gladiator.""  What I don't understand is why.  Personally, I think it's a terrible movie.  I won't even bother detailing its numerous historical inaccuracies.  To do so would require a book.  For those of you more historically inclined, suffice it to say that the movie combines elements from the reins of Julius Caesar, Caligula, and Commodus.  Indeed, the Emperor actually portrayed in this movie is more like Caligula than anyone else.  Some of you may consider this to be a minor point but we are talking about a span of 200 years.  If this were equated to modern times, you would get a scene where Abraham Lincoln takes Air Force one and flies back to Washington.  200 years is 200 years.  But, as I promised, I won't get stuck on the historical inaccuracies.What makes this a terrible movie to me is the stupid plot.  In the beginning of the movie, Commodus has no problem riding into the camp of a powerful general.  Seeing as powerful generals often seized power in ancient Rome, this would seem to be an exceedingly stupid thing to do.  Next he kills his father, Marcus Aurelius.  No one seems to care or suspect.  I guess they were more stupid in those days.  Next, Maximus refuses to shake his hand, signalling no support for the new Emperor.  Of course, because everyone in those days must have been stupid, Maximus does not feel his life is in danger and takes no immediate steps to protect himself.  If you believe that people from the past were dumber than what they are now, you can accept these glaring mistakes but I can assure you that people back then were not this stupid.Now Maximus is seized from his tent to be executed.  Where is his army? Here is the general who was adulated by his army but, suddenly, his army is nowhere to be found.  Next, Maximus overcomes not one but 2 armed executioners.  Of course, they had no idea that they had to be careful with the condemned man because they were more stupid in those days.Next comes the confusing part.  Maximus has been wounded in Germany. Somehow, he makes it all the way to Spain in a couple of days.  (It must've been a couple of days because he's still bleeding!) The only explanation I can offer for his having made it so fast from Germany to Spain on horse is that his horse must've been a Porsche.  (He was in Germany after all.) Then, somehow, we find him in Africa.  I won't even ask how he got there.Things get even better from here on in.  First of all, the gladiator fights are so vicious and brutal that if this had been true historically, Rome would have run out of gladiators very quickly.  Of course, our hero Maximus is in reality Superman, who somehow made his way to ancient Rome before coming to metropolis.  It's not enough for Hollywood that Maximus never loses.  Not only does he never lose, but he can defeat upwards to 10 men at a time as long as they are obliging enough to approach him one at a time. Maximus can also wrestle off Tigers.  Like I said,- Superman.Then things get really ridiculous.  The Emperor, who previously ordered Maximus' execution, suddenly decides that Maximus is too popular to kill now.  He had no problems trying to execute him amidst his own army where Maximus was tremendously popular, but now he fears the mob of Rome.  We keep hearing how the real power lies with the mob so I guess it's understandable that the Emperor fears those bakers, millers, and stonemasons more than Maximus' army.  Alas, the poor Emperor Commodus.  The most powerful man in the world simply is unable to kill this invincible gladiator Maximus.  Like I said, Superman.Finally, the Emperor decides to take things into his own hands.  He will kill Maximus himself in a gladiator fight.  Never mind that Maximus can take on 10 professional gladiators at a time.  The Emperor will take him on.  Of course, he gives him a little stab wound to even things up.  I like equating things to modern times.  So, the president of the United States, unable to rid himself of a dangerous adversary who has somehow become heavyweight champion of the world, decides to challenge the champion in a boxing ring after having administered a drug.  This is what this movie would be proposing if it were set in modern times.As I said, I cannot understand why people think this is a great movie.  If you believe people were more stupid in the past, then maybe you can accept the pap that this movie is offering as a plot.  I personally thought the plot was written for children.  And even though I haven't dealt with the historical inaccuracies, believe me when I say they are constant throughout the movie and they are also ludicrous.

Russell Crowe has shown he can be an A-list actor.  I wasn't sure what to expect, I just knew it would be a great movie.  And it was!

This film is amazing.  Everything about it, from the cinematography, to the costumes, the special effects, the score (I am in love with the score!), and even the acting, was outstanding.  You know a movie is really good when it is three hours long and you hardly even notice it from all the mind-blowing action and gorgeous scenery on screen.  The story itself is also well-done, but I will save all the details for your own visit to the theatre, which I definitely recommend (and find the one with the biggest screen and best sound system possible!).  It does contain a lot of violence and ""gore"", but if you can handle it you will appreciate everything else the movie has to offer.Not only does Gladiator instill an awe-inspiring sense of wonder and appreciation for history by capturing all the splendour, grandeur, and political complexity of Ancient Rome near the end of its empirical might, but it also has embedded within its story that eternal theme of peace and serenity for which every soul searches.",Gladiator
1267,Park2sp,How did this movie win!? Doesn't anyone else remember that this is a genre pic?,6,17 May 2001,"Doesn't anyone else remember that gladiator movies are a genre? If not, allow me to educate. Gladiator movies (like the old steve reeves hercules pictures) were companions to the old spaghetti westerns or the errol flynn style swashbuckling pictures. The movies were successful because they were fun and simple, but that was it. They were sometimes grand in that they had a lot of extras (even when the occasional roman soldier can be seen wearing a gold watch), but that was really it. The plots were nothing special. They were all pretty much the same, actually. Element one, larger than life hero who just wants to be left alone to live his life has been stripped of everything by the evil villain. Element two, said villain. Element three, a girl. Put all three together, let the hero triumph over insurmountable odds, cut and print, and you've got your picture. Sound familiar? Now, it's great to see this genre picked up again for fun, even if it did take itself a little too seriously, but PLEASE, don't go around saying it was a great movie. It was just a gladiator movie, nothing special. Don't get your idea of ancient roman civilization from the movie either, spend some time in the library for christsake.",Gladiator

His rapid paced editing of mostly more intimate widescreen POV shots brought something new to the Ancient World Epic genre.  Some have likened this to pandering to the MTV-watching crowd, but I reject that notion. Fast editing for no apparent reason (as in ARMEGEDDON, for example) is MTV-like, and quickly results in both confusion and boredom for the viewer; but a fast-cutting style, sparingly used to immerse the audience into the center of a sudden storm of life-and-death violence, is artistically valid and effective in conveying the adrenaline surge, terror, and sense of chaos that such combatants would likely experience.",Gladiator

The cinematography and lighting is gorgeous, although I havesome technical beefs with the DP (please, filmmakers, don't overuse filters--it's a little cheesy). The story is quite something; a historical epic with a good deal to say about modern culture and society (Proximo: ""I'm an entertainer."" Maximus: ""Are you not amused?""). However, I have a big problem with CG (computer-generated imagery). No matter how sophisticated, it always looks strange, and never looks real. Its use is better and more restrained here than, for example, in Star Wars: Episode One (a ridiculous waste of millions of dollars in technology), but here it's still oppressive. I think of all the people who must have put in months of their time making little tiny CG Romans walk around a big CG Colosseum, and I wonder what might have been a better use of their time...

1281,logan5_de,Nothing compared to Ben Hur,4,29 May 2000,"When I saw the first trailer of this movie I was excited. I always was a fan of the epic movies of the fifties and sixties and of ancient Rome too. I also adore ""Alien"" and ""Bladerunner"" (but who doesn´t?) so I expected a great, spectacular movie. I should have known better. Ridley Scott hasn´t made a really good movie since the early nineties and so ""Gladiator"" is a I-wanna-be-an-epic-film-but-am-only-a-plain-popcorn-movie. I just can´t believe how any one dares to compare it with classic epics like ""Ben Hur"", ""Spartacus"" or even ""Quo Vadis?"". OK it could be pretty good entertainment to the average audience but it´s a torture to viewers with knowledge of ancient Rome. The fifties and sixties epics weren´t completely authentic either, Ustinov was an outstanding Nero, but Nero didn´t burn Rome. But they managed to recreate the atmosphere of the Roman Empire. ""Gladiator"" doesn´t! This movie is located in some historic ´fantasyland. Take the cinematographic style of ""1492"" add battlescenes from both ""Braveheart"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", a plot from ""The Fall of the Roman Empire"" and a gladiator school and fight scenes from ""The Gladiators"" and ""Spartacus"" even a little bit of ""Star Wars"" and you get ""Gladiator"". Sometimes such mixtures of well-known elements and images work out see ""Star Wars"". But although this movie lacks innovative ideas it features nearly every known cliché and is absolutely unrealistic concerning historic accuracy. Of course nearly no historic movie (see above) is completely accurate, but none of the epics of the past (leave out the trash from Italy or Spain) ignored history like ""Gladiator"" does. It starts right in the beginning. The roman legions fight a germanic tribe to conquer it´s land. Completely wrong! During the reign of Marc Aurel the Romans fought desperately though still successfully to keep the germanic tribes away from their borders. They did NOT fight to conquer Germania, they didn´t conquer any new german territories after their defeat in the Teutoburg Forest battle more than a century ago. The germanic warriors shown are pure fiction, nothing is correct, not their appearance or their weapons or the tactics they use (in the movie they have none!) The battle is completely unrealistic beginning with the battlefield in the midst of a forest, the romans avoided forest battles. The roman forces used ballistas at sea or at sieges but not in field battles. Instead of arrows they threw their pilums and then fought with their swords. The roman army was infantry since the late days of the republic and had no own cavalry, they only hired cavalry from allied tribes. A roman general who was respected by his soldiers that strong could never have been arrested this easily without the risk of revolting troops. Maximus would have cremated his dead family (romans didn´t bury their dead) and why on earth was Maximus captured and enslaved at his burned homestead (Hello George!) and brought to what, Morocco? He was a roman citizen and at least when he was identified in the collisseum he would have had to be released from his illegal slavery. The gladiators costumes were more like ""Excalibur"" a pure fantasy design. The CGI-made rome is more like L.A. 2019 from ""Bladerunner"". Totally unrealistic architecture, with the exception of the collisseum itself, not to mention the cityplan. And the dark, faded-out CGI´s of the city weren´t very convincing either and surely they didn´t impress me they just looked like a big videogame. Of course Commodus arrival in Rome was impressive and by the way looked like Riefenstahls ""Triumph of the Will"" (or like the Massassi Throne Room George?) but it would have needed nothing less than the entire roman army to fill this fictitious monumental plaza . The dark, sombre, windy palace was more like a medieval castle and didn´t create at all the atmosphere of a roman setting. I don´t want to say to much about the absolutely nonsense concerning the ""political"" background of the ""plot"" (""Fall of the roman empire"" wasn´t that accurate too) but Marc Aurel wasn´t murdered, but Commodus was, after a 12 year reign of terror. There were no intentions at all to restore the ""Old Republic"" instead of the Empire (sorry George no violation of a ""Star Wars"" trademark intended) and the pseudo-democratic message in the end of the movie just hurts with its forced pathetic atmosphere. All of these mistakes (I left out a lot more, especially considering religion) could have been ignored if the movie would have what I call ""magic"". But it hasn´t, it lacks atmosphere, good cinematography (not ONE good shot of Rome!) and a convincing plot. It has some good actors, but Russell Crowe is no Charlton Heston, Joaquin Phoenix is no Ustinov and Harris is no Alec Guiness. Finally Hans Zimmers soundtrack is a mere desaster in a mediocre movie, an uninspired pseudo-vangelis music-jam from several non-roman cultures (why did he use HEBREW chants in the end of the movie?) without any regognizable or memorable leitmotives which doesn´t fit at all to the roman background. Hans Zimmer is definitely no Rosza! I know to most viewers I am a pedantic old-fashioned (although I´m only 31) nit-picker but I was shocked to see this lame and overhyped movie in the Top 250ies of the IMDB. When I came home it was past midnight but I had to watch ""Quo Vadis"" immediately as an antidot to the disappointing movie I had just experienced.4 out of 10",Gladiator

1283,urbisoler,"Here's why I liked ""Gladiator"" . . .",10,30 December 2001,"I grew up in what is called a simpler time. Motion pictures then are considered milksop today because they didn't deal with ""real life"". I'm glad I'm not a kid today. They have had to deal with destructive drug use, vulgar sex, disgusting language, unredeemable violence, disease, rape, incest . . . name it, it is part of today's culture. And, it IS destructive. Motion pictures in the 40's and 50's left us with a set of values about how one should live our lives. They were idealized. They were about duty, honor, courage, justice, etc. and if they were about the opposite of those values, they reflected the consequences of a wasted life. Gladiator is ""old-fashioned"" movie-making. I liked it because it reminded me of my youth which was a great time to be young. But it ought to be an important movie also. Just imagine all the impressionable young minds glorying in the heroism of Maximus. I'm not a religious man but a picture like this makes me wish I were. I have a hard time believing that there are rewards in an after-life for a heroic life. That is why it is so important for our young people to have a valued childhood; so they can grow to be a valued adult. The rewards of a good life may only be realized in THIS life. Gladiator goes beyond our time but movies like that didn't harm me as a youngster; no more than the fantasy stories we grew up with. If the fantasy of an after-life is deemed destructive then I suggest you don't see the current Harry Hopper films; nor the Lord of the Rings or even It's a Wonderful Life. Actually there is a long list of films that may be milksop but I don't think there's enough of them, especially these days.As for Russell Crowe being a ""poor"" actor, I think those critics will have to reevaluate their positions when they have seen ""A Beautiful Mind"". Russell just might win ANOTHER oscar.",Gladiator
1284,Irmy-nl,I don't know...,8,3 June 2000,"Tomorrow I am going to see it for the second time. I'm still in doubt about how I feel about it. I remember watching the movie and every now and again I was stunned by a beautifull image. Landscape, fight etc. But even though Russel Crowe's Maximus has some horrible stuff done to him, I didn't cry one tear. It all (well most of it, I didn't really like the Elysian dream sequences very much) looked great, but I wasn't really moved by the action.But I couldn't stop thinking about the film, and photo's of Russel Crowe as Gladiator do draw my eyes to them. I bought the soundtrack and have been listening for it for three days now, and the music is touching. And so I'm going to see it a second time and see if the movie is great after all...",Gladiator

1286,cruisinxx7,for those who believe in heroes,9,27 May 2000,"As my summary suggests, this is classic example of a legendary ""hero"" way back when, with battles and death galore, tinted with unsurmountable odds and a love interest to boot. Clooney (Maximus) plays his role surprisingly well as talented general who, after his initial escape from death, battles for vengeance on his own. And we all know nothing is more dangerous than a man who has nothing to lose. Despite what you might think beforehand, the fight scenes are NOT repetitive; each has its own flare and creativity that will interest the most of you, if not sicken you with special effects (plenty of blood; not for the weak stomach). My only complaint is the way the final scenes were handled; they seemed set up (unbelievably I might add) and they made you expect a huge battle to conclude the story, but it never happened. That foible aside, I had high hopes and was not disappointed.If you've seen Gladiator, you may think I'm over-generalizing it, and well, I am. If you haven't, for the most part, it's well worth your money, because everyone needs a little fantasy story with honor, loyalty, and heroism ironed into their head. When we see someone achieve something like that, even in a movie, although me might not know it, we feel refreshed at what a single human can accomplish.",Gladiator

The 'long shots' and 'aerial fly-bys' of the city seem straight out of the remade Star Wars movies.  The CGI tigers in the Coliseum seemed blurred.The plot is so clichéd it's breathtaking!  We've all seen Ben Hur, we want something different!  And the number of times the emperor could have killed Maximus off, it was like a 60's Batman episode when the baddy always want's Batman to die in an interesting way.I won't list the continuity errors.However I did like the highly stylised fight scenes.

The picture could easily have fallen into a simple revenge story, which is how the advertisements seem to portray it, but along the way the hero realizes that revenge does not provide enough sustenance to propel him indefinitely.  In the end it is his altruistic vision of the ideal of Rome that allows him to fulfil his quest.  This is the kind of patriotic hero that has been missing in the movies for so long considering the cynicism of the last decade.  Especially compared to the recent ""The Patriot"" (which is, in the end, simply a revenge story) this is a movie with a hero to be celebrated.",Gladiator
1293,Bert-82,Big disappointment,1,24 August 2000,"My nephew, Matt (10 yrs old), summed up the picture very well when he said as we were leaving - ""That Roman Emperor was REALLY whiney"". There is a problem inherent to all gladiator movies - people come to see them for the fight sequences and not the plot. Not even Stanley Kubrick could surmount that problem (which, in reality, is a studio problem i.e. the grafting of studio morality, storytelling and themes onto a foreign stock). Thus we have a VERY long movie, full of fight sequences, and when there is no fighting there are certainly people trying to tell us about IMPORTANT themes that appear nowhere else in the story. Then there is that studio morality thing. Rome is not America. Neither is the conflict between Imperialists and Republicans one of freedom (both sides wanted slavery). And, in the end, what is the story about. Nothing but a pathetic and rather far-fetched Hollywood revenge fantasy.I am a fan of director Ridley Scott. He does some wonderful things with candlelit scenes. The action scenes are fun (although the slo-mo/strobing gets tedious over the length  of this piece). Also a delight (not to mention an in-joke) having Derek Jacobi. In toto, however, the film is a big disappointment.",Gladiator

All of the character interactions were done so well. Russell Crowe was, as always outstanding.  I have yet to see him not be a full character.  Totally absorbing as Maximus.

1298,janosj-1,Ridley Scott and his team gave me a brilliant lesson in history.,10,11 April 2009,Yesterday evening I learned more about a specific part of the history of the Roman Empire than I ever did on University. 'The devil disappeared from the details' and some angel must have entered. Marcus Aurelius was the only Roman Emperor who is also known as a great philosopher. His murdering by Commodus was a really cruel scene. The role of Russell Crowe was played exceptionally well and the details in the whole movie were so exact that I still could blame some of my University-professors of not knowing what they were talking about.History presented this way would become a new approach for youngsters who prefer all kind of subjects...minus history. Giving more than 10/excellent is not possible but Ridley Scott is in my opinion the best man to re-introduce 'History as a subject' on both High Schools and Universities.

The emperor has the courage and brain of a little child and this was in contrast to the ""courageous"" and ""honourable"" Maximus. It's way too predictable and clichéd.

1309,bensajo,Fantastic Movie - Historically ACCURATE!!!,10,17 March 2002,"Just so you know, this is probably the most historically ACCURATE movie of ancient Rome ever.  The special effects and plot are amazing, but what really gets my goat is how you so-called ""historians"" make such a big fuss with ""anachronisms"" that don't even exist.  Sure, some horsemen have stirrups, but just because their is no evidence *today* does not mean that they didn't have something that looked like it.  These so-called historians may know about facts, but the people at dreamworks were trying to recreate a civilization that collapsed fifteen-hundred years ago (not including Byzantium, of course).  Below are just a few of the arguments that I could come up with, with the ""historian's statement followed by my response.1.  ""They never threw bread in the collosseum like hot dogs at a baseball game!""  Well, just because their is no evidence AT THE MOMENT doesn't mean that there will ever be at all.  And besides, they had food stands outside, just like at a baseball game - why not have throwers?2.  ""Gladiator's were rarely ever killed, because they were very valuable!"" Really (OH MY GOD!) This is probably the lamest argument ever!  They never had the electric chair for capital punishment, so they had to find another way to get rid of their ""criminals"" (P.O.W.'s, Christians...).  At that point in history, many Romans were poor and miserable, so the government decided to take their minds off of their lives by watching other people suffer.  In fact, during the time of Commodus (the emperor in the movie), thousands of gladiators were killed.3.  ""Male gladiators and female gladiator's almost never fought together"". Just because there is no immediate evidence does not mean that they never did.  And also, maybe Commodus wanted to give the crowd something out of the ordinary.4.  ""The Roman Writing is wrong"" That is because we are looking through the eyes of a latin-speaking person.  Since the Romans could understand their mother tongue as we can, we could assume that reading was just as natural. It is challenging to explain, but let's say that in a movieif our mother-tongue was latin, the writings on buildings in a French movie would be written in latin as well.5.  ""The names do not follow the normal Roman pattern (daughter of of Julius is Julia, and how the daughter of Tiberius would be Tiberia)"".  The Roman empire ruled a very large space, so their are many different ethnicities. Cicero never had a ""traditional"" Roman name, so why can't Marcus Aurelius' daughter be named Lucia?6.  ""In the battle scene, the many siege weapons were not invented yet till centuries later.""  Oye Vey!  The romans were ingenius with the art of siege warfare.  In fact, the large catapults and ballista's were in perfect time. They were wrapped in sheets of oil and set alight as well!  One ballista (a huge field artillery-like crossbow), known as the Helepolis, was the most sofisticated weapon of the time, because when a crank was pulled, a deadly dart was fired, and another was mechanically set.  That is why you see all the flaming arrows in the beginning.5.  ""The romans never had an archery unit.""  They very well did!  They were called missile units, and were usually fed from the local auxillaries, such as the ones in Syria.  They were the best in the world at that time.  And besides, in Persia, the Romans had to fight against Parthians, whose strategy was to fire arrows on horseback.  Don't you think that it would be stupid for a heavily clad footman to chase a light-speed horse archer, when that foot soldier belonged to an army that was the best the world has ever seen?6.  ""The battle scene was all screwed up""  The romans did use scientific warfare, but, as we see in the beginning, the battle in Germania was going on for a long time before we are there, so maybe the romans did not see the german's as much of a threat?  And even though the roman's slashed in this movie with their swords instead of the ""known"" hide-and-stab technique, did it ever occur to you that it might have been part of Maximus's strategy, though how unlikely it seems?7.  ""The costumes are wrong.""  Not every single Roman wore a toga!  That is like saying all North American's wear jeans!  Only officials down to high middle-class wore them.  The poor people probably wore a simple tunic (which they almost all did), but remember that many provincials visited the Eternal City itself (Gauls in trousers, and so on.).And finally, the stupidest nitpick ever:""The characters in that story never died like that""  True.  Aurelius was never murdered by his son, and nor was their a person called Maximus in the first place.  But their never was a person called Ben Hur either, so why are you historians ganging up on this innocent sword-and-sandals-soon-to-be-a-classic movie?  The movie is historical fiction - FICTION that uses a historical context to play the characters in.  There is nothing wrong by bending the facts in an entertainment movie (the best stories are what-if stories, like this, in my opinion).  It's not as if this movie is a history lesson on how these people lived.Thank you for reading my comments.  Even though I am not a graduate YET, I have read volumes and volumes of books on ancient Rome from ""A History of the Ancient World"" by the historian Chester G. Starr to poetry by Ovid.  I really hope that you people who think that this movie is full of more anachronisms than ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"" have gained a couple nuggets from a budding wisdom.",Gladiator

It was real brutal but what happened after the battle to Maximus and his family was even worse and I think it was a great intro.Then he started to fight in the arena and started to earn glory and after a while the emperor know who gladiator was and he wanted him death he tried lots of things but maximum wouldn't lose.The special effects in the movie were great and the music suited the scenes it was also nice that they had given some thought to the afterlife.U should really go and watch the movie so what u waiting for go buy it ore rent it.,Gladiator
1311,bfrantz,Excellent movie that even got some of the history right!,9,21 May 2002,"Gladiator is one of my favorite movies to date.Review: While the storyline is fictional, the emperors and their character traits are historical. In both the movie and in history, Marcus Aurelius was a good emperor who cared about Rome but who had a very cruel son (Commodus). The addition of Maximus is not necessarily historical, though Commodus was (SPOILER) assassinated (END SPOILER) by someone. Also, in history Marcus Aurelius allowed Commodus to be his successor, where in the movie, that was not his intent. I thought the storyline was excellent. Extremely gripping and intense. An excellent battle of good vs. evil.Objectionable Content: This IS an R rated movie! Actually though, it really wasn't nearly as bad as I expected. I started watching the movie with expectations of gory battles with blood everywhere. I was pleasantly surprised. It still had some really nasty parts, but as a whole the gory parts were very short and the camera quickly moved on. It is definitely too gory for a PG-13 movie, but it really isn't terrible. As for other objectionable content, profanity is limited to only a few words that are in most PG-13 movies and sex/nudity is practically non-existent. The princess seems to try a couple times to make moves on the married Maximus, but he ignores her and moves on. Commodus also is a bit ""too"" loving and close to his sister (the princess), but nothing is further hinted or shown. Maximus also prays to Roman gods and frequently talks about how he will go into the after-life and be with his family. If that were true, the movie's ending would be much more triumphant. All in all though, objectionable content is fairly minor for an R rated movie.Conclusion: This is a great movie, especially for being rated R. My main problem with it is that Maximus doesn't seem to mind killing the other gladiators much. He voices his thoughts that it is a sick and disgusting form of entertainment, but he still does it. Not that he had a choice, but he only spoke out against it once in the whole movie. Also, the whole movie is about his rise to recognition so that he makes it to the Roman Colliseum, where he can kill Commodus, the evil emperor who killed his family. I don't blame him one bit, as I was furious at Commodus after he told Maximus how he killed his family (probably one of the most sad parts in the whole movie), but from a moral standpoint, it would have been better for Maximus to not take the law into his own hands (although that wouldn't have made a very entertaining movie). My point is that not everything the protagonist does is good and worthy of being a role-model. He is loyal to his family and country however, and he does value life (even though he valued his own life more than the other gladiators he was fighting). All in all, there are some things to be concerned about morally, but all these things are historical. In conclusion though, an excellent movie. Amazing acting (Russel Crowe was awesome!), emotional storyline, awesome CG graphics and scenery, cool battle scenes (even though they can be pretty nasty), and an epic battle of good vs. evil. I loved it. Excellent, very entertaining, and not all that gross. I would recommend this for people who want a serious but awesome movie, and who are above the age of 13. It also has fairly good history, so for Roman history fans this would also be a great look. A definite 9 rating.Extras: DVD - 2 discs, movie in widescreen format, running audio commentary, 11 deleted scenes with or without commentary, as well as unused shots and leftover sequences, the making of Gladiator, a 50 minute feature on gladiators and their contests, a feature about the musical score for Gladiator, a gladiator journal, original storylines for key sequences and deleted sequences (also has conceptual art), a still gallery of portraits, Rome, Germania, the Collosseum, Zucchabar, and behind the scenes, and theatrical teaser and trailer, cast bios, and production notes.",Gladiator
1312,SECurtisTX,A Movie for the Toilet Bowl,1,30 March 2004,"This movie is the very epitome of what I hate about movies.  The Hollywood-ization/bastardization of what could have been a great movie. The FX and action were great, the characterization was adequate, the plot was dumb, and the ending was abysmal.  Why doesn't anyone in Hollywood have the courage to take a movie where it ought to go instead of where the test audiences say it should go?This is a gladiator movie.  You know what that means?  It was set during the Roman Empire.  During the reigns of Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus. It was NOT a fantasy.  When you set a movie during a historical time frame, there are certain rules you have to abide by.  One of those is, you do not rewrite history on a grand scale.  The main reason to set a movie within a historical context is to give it plausibility.  You do not then crap on that plausibility by having the characters do things that would have caused all of history to lumber down a different path.In Braveheart, William Wallace did not rally the Scots, defeat the English, march into London, kill the king of England in a duel, and establish a democracy.  Why?  Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a great movie into a crappy movie.  In Dances With Wolves, John Dunbar does not rally the Sioux nation in a war to conquer the United States, kill Ulysses S. Grant in a duel, and establish a new form of government in Washington based on Sioux practices.  Why?  Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a great movie into a crappy movie.  In Gangs of New York, Leo DiCaprio's character did not face Abe Lincoln in an arena, kill him, and establish a new form of government in Washington where the Irish were the ruling class.  Why?  Because that isn't what happened; and it would have turned a mediocre movie into a crappy movie.
***SPOILER ALERT!!!***
So in Gladiator, an exiled Roman general kills the Emperor in the arena and in so doing allows the reestablishment of the Roman Republic in 182 A.D. You know what?  It didn't happen that way, and it turned a great movie into a crappy movie.  The makers of this movie took all the plausibility of setting and trashed it.

This is the time when you fight all your battles for yourself and your family.

1318,calebwilliams,a terrible waste of two and a half hours of your life,1,24 October 2003,"Gladiator is an epic movie - it is the most breathtakingly awful fiasco of a film made for many years.Watch the battle scenes besides other popular movies, like Lord of the Rings, and the direction looks terrible.  Watch them alongside Kurosawa's Seven Samurai and it soon becomes apparent that if you deposited two cameras in a cage full of monkeys, they would make a better artistic job of filmaking than Ridley Scott.  The actors are uniformly awful, the CGI effects are overused and unconvincing, the script is turgid and the political message of the whole thing is deeply confused.  While the historical inaccuracy of the notion that the Romans had a deep affective investment in domestic ideology is amusing for two minutes, the sheer hackneyed conventionality of it soon becomes direly boring.  Most offensive of all, however, is its political charlatanism.  Gladiator pretends to be advocating radical republican democracy (think Rousseau), but in fact uses classical republicanism as a screen to peddle the same modern right wing liberal message as every other forgettable American B-movie.
The only way the acclaim it has received can be explained is by recourse to the near illiteracy and general ignorance of its ""fans"".Basically, if you know anything about art, you will hate this film.  If you understand 'cool' you will detest it.  If you are an uneducated male, who is slightly insecure about his masculinity, or a brainless Crowe worshipper stuck in a teenage lifestyle with nothing better to spend your time on than dusting your collection of his posters, you will probably adore it.",Gladiator
1319,mcook128,An Amazing Epic!,10,12 May 2004,"Ridley Scott demonstrated his excellent directorial skills in this epic movie.  Opening with a wonderfully choreographed battle scene, Scott manages to integrate the personal strife of Maximus with the exciting action sequences, all set with the political backdrop of late-Empire Rome.
Of course, when talking about Gladiator, one cannot ignore the powerful performance of Russell Crowe as General Maximus - 'Gladiator'.  His icy stare, bold delivery, and convincing stunts and fight sequences made him a deserving winner of the Oscar in 2000.  Crowe is well-contrasted in the movie by Joaquin Phoenix as the ruthless Emperor, longing to expand his own glory, while ignoring the needs of Rome, and the wishes of his father.
One aspect of the movie that is less publicized is the musical score. Hans Zimmer did an excellent job putting together a score that captures the emotions of the movie and fitting with the historical  background.
My problems with the movie?  Really only one: Maximus is too perfect.  Is that a reason to dislike the movie?  Not at all.  Just being nitpicky really.  To me, Gladiator had all the right tools and made the most of them, and that is why I think it is one of the top movies!",Gladiator

From beginning to end, it provided delightful acting, a great storyline and perfect editing. Location wise, spot on. Props looked like they were genuinely from the era, and the story was not too unrealistic, which made it a great film to understand and watch. It doesn't quite have the feistiness of 300 but it's storyline far exceeds 300's which in comparison is a little mediocre, but then again 300 also uses slow-mo which Gladiator does not. Joaquin Phoenix executes his villainous role spectacularly, and really gets us to hate the guy he is portraying. The loss of Maximus' family also makes you want to sympathise with the character more which delves you deeper into the actions he makes, and makes you far happier when he overcomes Commodus.

I remember watching this at the cinema on release and being blown away. One of those films that I knew I just had to own and watched it multiple times. It is a favourite, but I hadn't watched it for about 10 years.I think I enjoyed it more than ever this time..
This is simply a masterpiece.(I do think the extra 15 minutes of the extended cut make it even better)..
Crowe and Phoenix are superbly cast and deliver exquisite performances, particularly Phoenix who exudes wickedness and provides a character which has you longing for his comeuppance..
The cinematography and also the use of CGI captures the time and setting, and gives a splendid visual interpretation of Rome at the height of its power..
The theme 'Now we are free' plays a massive part in this film, and the offering from Hans Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is powerful and captures the spirituality so well..
The story is superb and you cannot help but long to join with Maximus in his quest for vengeance. It grabs hold of me each time and won't let me go until long after the credits roll..

An instant classic! Ridley Scott takes us back in time, giving us an aesthetic look and feel of the glorious Roman empire. The visuals are breathtaking, showing ancient Rome in all its glory. The Colosseum looks pretty dope and so do all the places in the city.Russel Crowe's performance is something extremely special. Playing the role of the noble Roman General Maximus, he portrays a variety of emotions pertaining to the honorable Roman guard. He almost single handedly carries this epic to great heights. A very well deserved Oscar for the guy. Joaquin Phoenix steals every damn scene he's in. Playing the egoistic Commodus who has a bizarre view of the world, he does justice to the character and the movie as a whole. The supporting cast is great as well. All in all, I did not find any weak link in the performances whatsoever.A pretty straightforward story, but I ain't complaining. The simple plot actually works well for the film. Helps keep the focus on the characters, thus making the film a character-driven one. Minimal number of inconsistencies.Gladiator is thus one of Ridley Scott's best films, period.

1331,esadams-96893,The most poetic and superlative film to date.,10,18 January 2019,"My love for this movie is undying. The acting is phenomenal, the soundtrack is among the best of all time, and the writing is fantastic. The execution of this masterpiece is what makes it such a treasure, as there are many films that were brilliantly conceived and lacked execution. Gladiator aced its execution. But while I marvel at the quality of the acting, music, writing, and directing, the reason this movie will always be my standalone-favorite is the poetic and beautiful message conceived by David Franzoni. Gladiator tells the tale of a simple man who loves his family and happens to hold high military status, Maximus Meridias. As his world is obliterated by Commodus, he is left in slavery with no will to live. But as he learns from Proximo that he may have the chance to face the immoral and false emperor, he desires to live for one last accomplishment: justice. As he eventually sacrifices his own life to stop this tyrant, he is deemed a national hero. Maximus saved the entirety of Rome from the corrupt paws of Commodus, but politics was not his motivation. Maximus never desired to reign over Rome as Marcus Aurelius wanted him to, he only desired to be with his family. As Commodus took that from him, he simply could not perish until Commodus had answered for his appalling crimes. Gladiator shows the image of what any man should be willing to do for his family: fight in shackles, endure through hellish sorrow, and protect his loved ones. This film speaks to me in great volumes, and I thank everyone who had a hand in creating this superlative work of art.",Gladiator

Maximus is a Roman general who is framed and betrayed. He ends up as a gladiator fighting in the great Colosseum. The whole story is about the fall and rise of the hero, an honourable man who is motivated by a thirst for revenge and a promise he once gave to the emperor. I remember when I was in school reading about the element of adventure in Greek plays. Adventure is : ""the change from happiness to misery or the opposite"". If this is right then this movie is one of the most adventurous movies ever made because it is based on this description. About the movie now, the acting was breathtaking by everyone, the directing was amazing giving the film a live, fast action character.

So skillfully delivered is this sturm und drang -- and so perfect a lead is actor Russell Crowe -- that the film's shortcomings are all but buried beneath the sheer awesome spectacle.Crowe plays General Maximus, chief legionnaire for the aging Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris). A fierce fighter and canny tactician, Maximus wants nothing more than to mop up a few Huns and go back to Spain where his family awaits.

1337,K.C.-4,What potential! What happened?,7,11 May 2000,"""Gladiator"" was the one film I was really looking forward to seeing this summer (asides from X-Men).  So when I finally got to see it, I was all set up to really enjoy a summer epic-- not blockbuster or action flick, but an epic, because I expected no less from Dreamworks or Ridley Scott.  What I got instead was a film that was stunning and breathtaking in every way, save the script.  The script for ""Gladiator"" dragged the entire film down.  What essentially happened-- and it's disturbing how easily this pattern applies-- is that the writers broke down the script for ""Braveheart"" and rewrote it using shallower characters and stilted dialogue.  The actors did a superb job with the pathetic material they were given, particular note being given to the performances of Joaquin Phoenix and Russell Crowe.  The visuals, particularly Scott's stylized way of altering the contrast and film speed during the action scenes to lend it that ""unreal"" aspect, were amazing.  I have an amazing amount of respect for the SFX people who did the Colisseum-- really good job, guys.  The pacing was also very nice.  They managed to make a very dense movie.  However, the script continually kept the film from hitting true epic greatness-- despite the best efforts of everyone associated with it.  After having read articles about the script problems ""Gladiator"" was going through, it's easy to see where the problems stemmed from.  Likewise, the only other problem I found with the film was the score, which was a bit heavy-handed and predictable (then again, the predictability comment could be handed over to the script as well).  My friends and I could predict EVERYTHING from opening shot to final scene within about five minutes-- perhaps just because we saw ""Braveheart"", perhaps because the script didn't take the risks it could have.  Why didn't Proximo have moral problems with being a gladiatorial profiteer even after he KNEW the psychological issues gladiators get?  Or even if he was so caught up with the thrill and the popularity-- why wasn't his character given more depth on this level?  Why didn't the script go into some REALLY difficult places-- like forcing Russell Crowe to combat his friends?  Why wasn't more done with the concept of winning over the mob as creating political power?  There were so many issues that could have been addressed that weren't-- and it was sad. Overall, an impressive piece of cinema-- if you look beyond the script. Congratulations guys-- with a good script in hand, you could have had a legend.  As it stands, you have a fun evening diversion.",Gladiator
1338,baa-2,Hey! It's a blockbuster! What more could you ask for!,7,12 July 2000,"For me, watching this capped a weekend of movies that started with Fight Club. This fairly mirthless picture is still lots of fun. The story is fairly unsophisticated, despite the film's length and palace intrigue story lines. Some of the effects and cinematography are stunning. The acting, if not particularly amazing, is still pretty solid.Russell Crowe rocked, but I've liked him since Proof, and he was the best part of The Quick and the Dead. All the secondary characters are decent. It's a pretty good child actor that doesn't incite murderous instincts in me.Fight Club was interesting, because it looked at fighting as a consequence of masculine ennui. Its characters fight to find a sense of themselves or their emotions, things that they've lost because they have lost their fathers. Gladiator's fighters battle because they have to, but Maximus, after initial apathy, also fights, to avenge the loss of his father figure. Tyler and Maximus both lead armies.

Interesting items relating to the movie were that after 100 movies and 1000 books on the Caesars and Rome depicting the Pretorian Guard with their cloaks and helmet plumes colored red, this movie dresses them in black.It also appears that the choreographer of the battle scene, at the start of the movie, is the same person who did the battle scenes for Braveheart or at least copied the approach. The other note of comparison is that Commodus did not have the strength of power to have Maximus killed for his defiance in the arena whereas Caligula would have certainly ignored the people's demand for life.

1352,jimmy-120,"Like a cheap chocolate Easter Bunny: pretty package, but hollow",5,13 February 2001,"There is a scene in Gladiator where Maximus is eating with a couple other gladiators.  One is Juba, the man he befriends almost immediately after getting captured; and the other is the really big man (I'll call him Big Guy), I am not sure of the name, who Maximus refused to fight earlier, while the gladiators were, I presume, getting evaluated on their skills.  In the scene Big Guy asks Maximus about his days as being a general.  He asks if he fought in Germania, and Maximus responds, and I apologize for not having the exact quote, ""I've fought in lots of countries.""  Something to that effect. When the question was asked, I thought to myself how interesting it would be if Big Guy had lost family in Germania.  When you think about it it was a terribly odd question for Big Guy to ask. It became a distraction.  I kept waiting for the great climax of the film, when Rome is safe and secure with Maximus finally being able to retire, when along comes Big Guy to do what none of the Romans could do: kill Maximus.  And why not, I figured.  After all, there were families killed in Germania too, right.  Unfortunately nothing came of it, and I don't think I am giving anything away when I say that Big Guy eventually gets shot with arrows (despite the obviously apparent safety vest underneath his tunic).  O.k. So I am giving something away, but he is a very minor character, as it turned out.I only mention this delusion of mine because I think it says something about how hollow the script was, and what could have been.  I mean, we had already been given a possible subplot during the ""evaluation scene"" when the two men give each other very serious looks, to put it mildly.  I thought that this subplot would have given the film what it dearly lacked: something worth saying--perhaps a comment on violence in our society, how the brutality of war effects people on both sides of the battlefield.  Frankly I would have liked to have had it happen.  It would have made the experience much more enjoyable.  Of course, the F/X still would have looked kind of cheesey, and the battle scenes would have been confusing and, quite frankly, poorly executed; but what a turn it would have made.  Only a handful of people (possibly those who had long since gone bonkers) would have seen it coming. Instead of this we get nothing really.  Just an especially brutal film that has nothing serious to say about anything.",Gladiator

And, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix ) may have been a more daunting foe for Maximus (Russell Crowe) in the ring, judging from what we know of his athletic prowess, even without the ""advantage"" of his having ""insured"" himself of victory (no spoiler).  (In fact, a powerful wrestler strangled Commodus to death at the behest of Commodus' trusted advisors in 192). Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter.  The opening scenes of Gladiator alone are worth the price of admission.  How WERE the Romans able to conquer and control almost a quarter of the world's population?  Take in the first 30 minutes of this film.  Then you'll know.  Ridley Scott has a genius for film making (which always begins with the visual).  Reminds me of Kubrick.  He  knows how it must have been, or could be, or should be.  So, you rearrange history a bit to create a first class story.  So what?  The script, the performances, the mood and tempo of action can't disappoint, unless you're so oriented to plots laced with video game inspired characters and disaster scenes that only a third century vintage Freddie Visits Mission Impossible will stir your senses.

I was willing to put up with a cardboard plot if the action and computer graphics were spectacular.  They were not.  The scale was all wrong... not realistic but cartoonish.

We went to see Gladiator because it was so highly rated (8.4!) by the participants in this great website (IMDb) and because we wanted to see Meg Ryan's new love, Russell Crowe, in the starring role for which he has won praise for his acting.  Because of the length of the movie, we came away wanting less.  Save it for a rainy day and video when you have a lot of time to kill.

Yes, it has some beautifully designed scenes. Yes, my wife was in tears at the end (which is seldom) - so it obviously touches some strings of one's soul. That's good enough. But... the Gladiator is full of cliches (pardon my French). Watching the movie I was constantly comparing it to other films. During the opening battle scene my wife whispered to me - ""Well, it's Private Ryan set in ancient Rome"". Yes, it is. Same jerky camera movements, same gore. The plot is almost scene to scene copy of Braveheart with overall atmosphere of Spartacus. We see the hero going through the field and touching grass tops - hell, I've seen this in dozens of Soviet movies about collective farms. Gladiators' cubicles are just like a modern prison - do you remember the episode when Maximus and his fellows come to the Colliseum for the first time dressed in blue (denim?!) outfits?  Haven't you seen this in many movies like ""Lock Up"" or ""Tango and Cash""? It's indeed a terrible mix of many previously seen movies.But what disappoints most is the final - as pathetic as the ones from the Soviet Stalin era pictures. Though it is a common feature of most Hollywood products. Being an European I can not understand the love of American directors to endings that leave nothing to one's imagination. The Evil is punished, the Good wins. Well, maybe I'm asking for too much from dream factory (grin). But the problem stays. These endings spoil even the best movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"". Watching it I was praying ""Good Lord, do not let this old Ryan salute Miller's grave"". God  did not listen to my prayer (another grin). Well, maybe its a punishment for my sins. Nevertheless the ""Gladiator"" is worth watching - for its sometimes really stunning visual effects, for very good performances of Russel Crowe and Oliver Reed.

1362,Uther Pendragon,The Roman Empire Strikes Back,9,2 May 2000,"Films like Titanic, The Mask of Zorro, Saving Private Ryan have re-introduced classic genres to new (young) audiences. Gladiator breaths new life into genre we know as 'Roman epic'.Like other great Roman-history films, Ben-Hur (1959), Spartacus (1960) and the Fall of the Roman Empire (1964) is Gladiator a feast for the eyes of moviegoers. Who better could direct this film than Ridley Scot; a former commercial-director. He had made a number of epic, visually mind-blowing films before; Alien (1979), Blade Runner (1982), Legend (1985), Thelma & Louise (1991) and 1492:Conquest of Paradise (1992) I have to say that in some of his films the actual story gets pushed to the background at times. Blade Runner's storyline was totally inferior to the visual aspects. Scott isn't the only director who tends to 'visualize' his films in that way. Michael Mann is also known as a maker of great visual epics like Last of the Mohicans, The Keep and Heat.Gladiator offers a variation of entertainment; a love story, costume drama and ""R"" rated violence. Body halvings, decapitations, unhandings and impalements are the types of gore you can expect Gladiator. The cast is outstanding, except Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. Phoenix has been miscast. The talented Russel Crowe is a strong impressive lead. Like his other good roles, in the Insider and Romper Stomper, he gives a superb performance. The same goes the late Oliver Reed. He died during the final shootings last year. A body double, with Reed's digital simulated face, completed the film.OK, enough already; Stop reading this stuff and just go see this movie for yourself.",Gladiator
1363,Shawn Stingel,"A graphic display of the gladiator wars in Rome. I came, I saw, I conquered",9,6 May 2000,"Russell Crowe is emerging as one of Hollywood's most enterprising actors with critically-acclaimed roles in Oscar nominated films such as ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""The Insider,"" the latter earning him an Academy award nomination for Best Actor (which he solely deserved). It comes as no surprise then why renowned director Ridley Scott (""Blade Runner"") would chose Crowe as the hero, Maximus, in this Roman epic about the gladiator wars and the struggle of the Roman Empire. Another wise choice on behalf of Scott was his selection of the dimensional Joaquin Phoenix who plays Commodus, the heir of the Empire after his father's death. Phoenix plays the typical jerk, the antagonist that defies all that is good and what goes against the people. Of course, that's his role but it's a juicy one. One of the best things about this film deals with its own aesthetic quality. If marveling over how realistic some of the fight scenes weren't enough, Scott digitally enhances the scenery to bring Rome right to your pupils. It's visually stunning and quite remarkable (Oscar-worthy perhaps), but it just may well be (sadly enough) its only redeemable feature.     This film is an astonishing visual achievement nonetheless thanks to the special effects team under Scott's command, but that's all the sword can penetrate through unfortunately. Crowe and Phoenix do what they can, and they do a great job of it, but the script is too choppy, too complex in its nature that we have a hard time making sense out of crucial moments, especially if you're not aware or Rome's history or the hidden Shakespearean peculiarities. I, myself was confused at times simply because some of the inside references went over my head.      Although subplots and climactic moments are crucial in the overall core of the movie, it did not deter however from the overriding aspect of the film's protagonist. Crowe delivers a grand performance that is quite complimentary to his previous ones, and ""Gladiator"" proves that he has the versatile capacity to transform into anything. He came, he saw, he conquered. Indeed",Gladiator

I wasn't impressed much with the cinematography either, too much gray and blue and strange ""jumping"" in some of the special effects.

The movie starts of with a spectacular battle-scene which is so visually overwhelming that even ""The Phantom Menace"" or ""The Matrix"" might have seem outdated. From there the story continues on and it never became boring from that moment. I must honestly say I never heard much from Russel Crowe but after this movie I'm sure I and many others will hear a great many things from him. He overplayed the other actors with ease, which is quite a thing to do since the other actors were also giving a very good performance. The music really fits the movie and it mad me want to go buy the sound-track of this movie. This movie should be in one line with classics as: Ben Hur, Star Wars and The Godfather. There was just one dissapointing thing about it and that was the end.

But after seeing this movie I realized I was completely wrong.  This movie is near-epic.  It's actually smart.  The directing is nearly flawless and the dialogue is amazing too. I just can't believe this is the same guy who did ""1492"".  That is amazing. Scott uses some excellent time-lapse photography and surreal dream shots that seem out of place for a time but in the end fit right into place.  The action sequences just add to the film.  Scott puts you right into the battle at the beginning as well as in the Roman Coliseum for the gladiator fights. The characters are rich and colorful and the ending is incredible.

Intense and moving in the same vein as 'Saving Private Ryan,' just a bit less gut-wrenching. I got the sense that something was left on the editing room floor in the relationship between Russell Crowe's Maximus and Djimon Hounsou's fellow gladiator--a little more development, maybe just one additional scene between the two men, would have been nice.  The only other flaw I noticed was when the film lapses dangerously close to self-parody in just a scant few spots, only to successfully pull back.  I didn't think much of either 'L.A. Confidential' or 'The Insider,' but Russell Crowe has won me over. Ridley Scott should be nominated for an Academy Award.

Did he love Marc Aurel (Alec Guiness gave the emperor-philosopher outstanding, Harris is not just my favorite) and his family, does he hate Commodus??? Surely, but its not on the screen. What else? Marc Aurel TOOK Commodus as Co-Emperor in 177 - but Manns movie told the same nonsense. And - nothing changed since ""Quo vadis?"" and ""The robe"" - the Emperor's conflict with the senate and ""the people"".

1374,tymflyer,"A story of honor, strength, faith",10,27 July 2000,"The element that most impressed me in this film was the underlying faith of Maximus through his many long weary years of trials.  One could argue that at a certain point revenge took over as his motivation (in this case, the presentation made the viewers hope for revenge also, as a reasonable response to a Hitler-like figure).   I saw revenge as the primary motivator in the Patriot, and it sickened me; in this film I see the death of a dangerous and hated leader as a goal, but not as a driving force.  The driving force for Maximus, it seems to me, is to be faithful to a much larger calling.  As he puts it at one point, ""What we do in life echoes into eternity.""  It is clear that he strongly believes that he will, in the afterlife, walk with joy with his wife and family by his side, if he stays true, maintains integrity, strength, honor, and principle.  In this sense I found the film to be much more uplifting than The Patriot, though in many elements the films were quite similar. Both achieved a scope of grandeur that was unbelievable, both had strong central characters who fight against all odds.  But I found one film uplifting, the other depressing, and I think it had to do with the underlying motivations of the characters.  Gladiator made me want to emulate Maximus; The Patriot made me hope to never become like Benjamin Martin.Both, though, admirably showed the grit of war without romanticizing it in the least.

Not to mention the complex relationship between all the characters, I find it difficult to justify gladiator being nominated for a academy award let alone winning over crouching tiger!I have seen gladiator a few times and so far its proving not to be a rewatchable film, even the beautiful CGI renderings of Rome don't seem so great after the second time.

1384,lango516,"Good, but not worthy of Best Picture Oscar",8,8 April 2001,"To tell you the truth, when I first saw this movie, I was kind of supprised that it was nominated for best picture.  However, considering the years batch of movies, I can see why.  2000 had a lot of good movies, but only two of them (Traffic and Crouching Tiger) were worthy of winning best picture. Previous years have had movies of even higher calibur (American Beauty, Saving Private Ryan, Schindler's List, Forrest Gump, The Shawshank Redemption).  If it wasn't for the ending I probably would have not even considered Gladiator for Best Picture at the Oscars.  Gladiator is a movie with good acting, decent special effects, exciting gladiator scenes, and a solid, but a times drab  screenplay.  In certain parts of the movie the dialogue seems kind of cheesy, but these errors are not glaring.  Those who are looking for an intelligent, mentally stimulating screenplay should look look elsewhere.  However if you are willing to compromise a little, then Gladiator should not disappoint.  Russell Crowe does give a solid performance, but I think his performance in last years drama The Insider was far superior.  Crowe's vocal tone is good, but at times his New Zealander's accent seeps through in Gladiator.  Joaquin Pheonix gives a Performance that just barely qualifies as worthy enough for an Oscar nomination. 
When compared to the other movies of this year, Gladiator's acting is on the level with Traffic, Crouching Tiger, Almost Famous, Erin Brockavich and various movies heavily considered by the academy for nomination.  As far as screenplay goes, Gladiator gets smacked by movies such as Crouching Tiger, Traffic, and Almost Famous, among others.  As far as the other categories go, Crouching Tiger's Cinematography and Traffic's film editing do more for their respective movies than did Gladiator's excellent sound and decent, but flawed visual effects.

I know what I was looking for when I went to see ""Gladiator,"" and that was testosterone-oozing killing machines lopping off arms and limbs in a plot not too intellectually stimulating where the the bad guy died and our hero won out.  I saw that, and I give the movie a 6-7 as a result; professionally-done, cliche`d, brainless action and nothing more.  It, too, was cheap (100 million dollar-cheap) escapism, so why is it the forerunner for Best Picture?The Academy was duped when they saw this.  There's nothing Best Picture-worthy about this film.  Performances?  No.  Direction?  No. Script?  A thousand times no!Russell Crowe for Best Actor?  To his credit, he's suave and probably tough enough to grind Kirk Douglas from ""Spartacus"" into chum.  He gives one of the best performances I've ever seen from someone who maintains the EXACT SAME facial expression and emotional state throughout 9/10 of the movie's running time.  The real talent here was with Joaquin Phoenix, who transformed a character written as a whining infantile nuisance that wouldn't scare a goldfish into a truly creepy and threatening presense. He deserves a Best Supporting Actor nomination, but not for this.  He gave an even better performance in ""Quills.""Speaking of Philip Kaufman's masterpiece, ""Quills"" is one movie on a list I would have rather seen nominated for Best Picture of 2000 than ""Diehard with Sandals.""  ""Almost Famous,"" ""American Psycho,"" ""High Fidelity"" and ""You Can Count on Me"" are only a few of the well-crafted pieces of cinematic glory we received in 2000 that were overlooked by the members of the Academy that would rather get soaked in au jus and thrown into a tiger's cage than ::gasp!:: NOMINATE A MOVIE THAT MADE LESS THAN 50 MILLION DOLLARS (Miramax films excluded)!!!  I guess the actors in the preceding films should've used a monotone voice and screamed a few more times.What really irks me, though, is the nerve of the Academy nominating ""Gladiator's"" overcooked, cliche`s-on-parade laden script.  Holy Mother of Christ, movies like this aren't driven by a script.  They're driven by studio executives throwing fistfulls of money to make something that will make you go ""oooh"" and ""aaaah.""Movies are an art form, and with that, ""Gladiator"" is the equivalent of the sketch artist at the mall doing portraits for ten dollars each.  The Picasso of the nominees is the challenging, explosive ""Traffic,"" and the awe-inspiring ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" (a movie with a hint of human connection and feeling; Ridley Scott, take note) is Salvador Dali.  I plea to any Academy Member that might by chance be reading this: please, I beg of you, leave this along with the mediocre ""Erin Brockovich"" and the preach-fest ""Chocolat"" at the bottom of the heap, and let a movie made by people who know and care take home the gold.",Gladiator

Rarely have I seen a new film on cinema that has gotten to me like this one. I have to say that i was enthralled by Hans Zimmer's opening music. And the performance by Mr Crowe is what the Oscars is all about. Genuinely fantastic. But hey, Joaquin Phoenix also delivers the goods in a satisfying role. Oliver Reed and Richard Harris also, gave their best. And Ridley Scott proves that he IS one of America's leading directors. Plus, I must say that Scott's comments on DVD is extremely insightful and sometimes funny.",Gladiator
1388,epfils,Spectacular,10,8 July 2006,"A movie like Gladiator is extremely rare and the concept involved does raise some question marks. However, the movie is so well made and so brilliant that it makes this one of the greatest movies ever made in history. Joaquin Phoenix's acting is absolutely amazing and brilliant and I'm surprised that he gets little mention and is often overshadowed by Russel Crowe. Joaquin Phoenix is certainly one of the most underrated actors of all time. The special effects are brilliant and the gore depicted so realistically that the violent is impactful yet not disturbing. The only minor nitpick about this epic is how Commodus is so easily hated by all and maximus gets so much support and backing so easily.",Gladiator

From acting to story, from music to cinematography and from special effects to anything else a film can be judged on it is just brilliant. it is a pure epic.  This is not your cheapo action summer flick like X-men. Everything has been thought out so well, and choice for all the actors and actresses were spot on, since i think nobody could have pulled it off as well as the main man Russell Crowe, which i like to say ""well done"" for receiving his oscar. From the opening scene of the wheat field, you know its a film which is going to be emotional and deep, and when the first battle appears, you know its going to be loud and fast moving.  This film has just one of the best endings i have ever seen (i won't say just incase you haven't seen it)Believe me it has it all, you will not be disappointed.""What we do in life, echoes in eternity""...so go and watch and enjoy!",Gladiator
1390,KjaneK,"great pictures, heavy score, brilliant antagonist",9,18 May 2020,"Gladiator is a movie with a topic I was not that much interested in. I watched it anyway and was blown away by so many magic shots. The Co-work of camera and edit draws a lot of outstanding images which are not only just beautiful but touching in the exact right moments of the storyline. Don't get me wrong, it still is brutal and disgusting in many ways but I loved that side notes of silence, of suffering in such an artistic pictures. Adding Joaquin Phoenix as the antagonist was a decision that could not have been made better. He's doing such a great job, his play is impressive. I highly recommend to watch Gladiator even though you may not be in historical movies.",Gladiator
1391,antonyhart,Excessively impressed half a year lately!,10,11 August 2001,"Its extremly rare that one watches a movie that grabs your attention so much that over half a year later it is what you consider to be the best film you have seen recently. Gladiator certainly has had this effect on me! Where so many other films which, at the time of viewing I considered to be really stand-out have faded in impact over the march of time, Gladiator soldiers on.In all departments Gladiator is one of the undeniable best. Its casting is perfect. Russell Crowe as 'Maximus' is a sight to behold. Having read the screenplay, the concept of his battlefield prowess and presence which is allured to is instantly recognisable on the screen. One see's Maximus as a man of honour, integrity, dignity and courage. By contrast Jouqain Phoneix as 'Commudus' epitomises a classic villain. Yet he rises above this and plays his character with such conviction one starts to believe he really exists. I gauge this by the fact that in seeing films in years to come with Phoenix, I will regard him still as not that character but Commudus. Connie Nielsen is also excellent in her role as 'Lucilla'. Richard Harris and the late Oliver Reed also support skillfully.Cast aside, the two areas that impressed me above all in Gladiator were the score and the visuals. Ridley Scott is truly an awesome director and Hans Zimmer in my opinion beyond even John Williams. The seamless, and I do mean seamless, transitions between CGI and conventional film is a sight to behold. As I watched the film on the big screen, the sight of Rome and the Colleseum was awe-inspiring. It is extraordinarily immersive. Zimmers score with vocals by Lisa Gerrard is close to perfect amd easily his most accomplished yet. It is stirring at the right moments and sensetive when the mood dictates it. EVERYONE SHOULD OWN A COPY OF THE SCORE!!!If one had to pick a weak point, I would have to opt for the script, which although brilliant was probably the least polished of the componets. However what really makes Gladiator stand head and shoulders above the rest is the manner in which it is epic, enthralling and exciting. It's a Hollywood blockbuster that manages to succesfully negotiate all the pitfalls that that conventionally entails. I highly recommend it!",Gladiator
1392,jmgatt,real life situation for an epic,10,2 January 2007,"There's all you might imagine, a real life situation for an epic. Remember that such battles where very common, not to mention the thousands of lives lost. Ridley Scott put the viewer into suspense and tension during the very first battle we had, not to mention the grandiose strategy Maximus had.Shot in Malta: Ricasli and other locations, the arena built had over 5000 extras. All awaiting for the signal...Roar did the crowd when Maximus entered. They loved him, a man of honour, a normal being, a prisoner, a warrior. Their HERO!Ridley Scott direction excelled at its best in Gladiator conveying the authenticity of life, our ancestors have lived!",Gladiator

1394,NewYorker76,"Beautifully made, an exquisite piece",10,22 November 2007,"This film is truly a masterpiece, a classic. My only regret is that I didn't get to see it on the big screen, I have only watched it on DVD. Technically it's as close to perfect as they come. I had never seen Russell Crowe in a leading role before this and I was blown away. Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed also put in first class performances. It was also nice to see an all too rare appearance by David Hemmings in his rather comical role as Cassius.The sets were awe inspiring. I find gore distasteful but the speed at which the action sequences take place allows insufficient time for it to become gratuitous. Besides, it's hard to depict the Roman arenas without showing a little blood, right?",Gladiator

1396,Alexis_Ray,The General who became a Slave. The Slave who became a Gladiator. The Gladiator who Defied an Empire.,10,16 November 2003,"At its barest bones, Gladiator is the tale of a wronged man seeking revenge. That plot framework will be familiar to most, but Gladiator combats its cliched roots well, offering dizzying action, political intrigue, and powerful visuals.Perhaps the most stunning thing on display in this film is its all-around superb acting. Russell Crowe's turn here as Maximus earned him an Academy Award that solidified his stardom. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a remarkable performance as the complex and disturbed Commodus. And the late Richard Harris is notable as the great, aging, philosophical Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed (here is his last performance) and just about everyone else are also outstanding.The title, `Gladiator,' brings to mind bloody arena contests, and the battle scenes don't disappoint - they are well-choreographed and filmed with creativity and intensity. (The graphic portrayals may be disturbing to some. If you don't like films that show blood and gore, don't see this one).The Academy Award-winning special effects that resurrect ancient Rome and restore the Coliseum to its former greatness are triumphs, and the Academy Award-nominated score, courtesy of Hans Zimmer, is riveting.Some of the film is historically accurate, but most of it isn't - expect to be entertained, not informed. Plus, there are a few distracting goofs - such as the clearly breathing corpse in the foreground of several scenes, and another presumably dead man who blinks when a woman lowers her hand to close his eyes.But these few blunders pale in comparison with Gladiator's many strengths. Definitely worth watching if you enjoy a good dramatic/action film that is also worthy of being called an epic. Gladiator is an astounding experience.10/10",Gladiator
1397,martin-eerma,A must-see movie,10,6 November 2002,"Why is it great? Because of the stunning performances of the cast, especially Joaquin Phoenix's. Gladiator is also a excellent mix between drama and action. And of course the soundtrack which adds a lot to the emotional part of the movie(e.g. the end).

1398,quirinus,Nice movie but is this original,7,11 October 2005,"Movie is technically very fine i have watched in theater twice and i like it much as lots of turks but sometime after the reason why we loved this movie became clear this was only a western look over an old Turkish movie series Tarkan... Maximus was so Turkic that he was wearing lamb fur(lamb was introduced by Huns to Europe) instead of bright armors of Romans,Like Tarkan he rides along his wolf, his family has been murdered by his foes ... you can claim that these may be inspirations of Ridley Scott from Tarkan but there are some scenes taken directly from Tarkan movies...1- Maximus fights a big German guy - Tarkan's fight against Giant Orso both are under snow.. 2- After the fight in arena, emperor orders death- neither Tarkan nor Maximus kill the victims. 3-The scene of birds over Rome 4-The appear order and camera movements in the arena at least the final is different, Maximus dies though Tarkan is immortal",Gladiator
1399,pink-crazy-chick,Outstanding,10,1 May 2011,This is one of them films which I can honestly say is absolutely brilliant. You fall in love with the characters straight away and love them more as the movie progresses. The storyline is fantastic along with the acting. The film is not very gory and there is less blood than I expected yet you still feel the excitement of the fights. I think the film is really good at making you feel certain emotions for certain characters and you know which ones your not suppose to like. The balance of the film is brilliant with fast moving fighting scenes along with calm and touching ones. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone.,Gladiator
1400,stevecs,great,9,13 July 2004,"Russell Crowe deserved the Oscar for this film. Yes, I know he got it ahead of some other worthy winners, but is portrayal is faultless. Despite its historical inaccuracies, the film has the look and feel of Ancient Rome- the greatness is conveyed through beautiful music and scenery (the gladiatorial arenas are amazingly well constructed and the fights themselves brilliantly choreographed)Crowe is one of my favourite actors of all time- his versatility often overlooked, his presence on screen (and stage) incredibly powerful. This film also served as a vehicle for Joaquin Pheonix- he is also a brilliant actor (saw him in Quills, he's very good in that).I really like this movie, and it deserved it accolades- a true epic. That opening scene is the most realistic depiction of an ancient battle on screen to date.",Gladiator
1401,frank_oleary,Brilliant,9,17 March 2012,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!",Gladiator
1402,greyollie-1,Tomb of Roman general who inspired Gladiator,10,17 October 2008,"Authorities in Italy have announced the discovery of the tomb of the Ancient Roman General who inspired Gladiator (reported in the The Times online website and elsewhere). Marcus Nonius Macrinus was a favourite of Emperor Marcus Aurelius, leading the Emperor's army to victory in Germania and across the Danube. However he did not end up a gladiator. Although the Emperor's son and successor, Commodus was indeed killed by a gladiator named Narcissius. After all, story-telling often involves the right o ""Poetic License"", so I do not get upset over minor matters in a wonderful film like Gladiator. Who knows how many younger viewers may grow up to be archaeologists because of Ridley Scott's masterful direction and the brilliant performances he inspired from Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast.Greyollie Australia",Gladiator

Russell Crowe is an amazing actor and it shows in this movie. The plot,acting,characters,set,props and anything else that can be named is flawless.

Also, outstanding music, set design, and battle effects create a solid, comfortable and emotional mood for viewers. Astonishing performances by Academy-Award winner Russell Crowe (A Beautiful Mind , Master and Commander), Academy-Award nominee Joaquin Phoenix (Signs , The Village [Not to mention, my favorite actor due to his performances.]), Connie Nielsen, and Richard Harris make this film a must-see. Spectacular battle scenes fill this movie, but I rather enjoy the work combination from Scott and Franzoni as they bring out a truly emotional storyline.

Every scene is very well-thought out and entertaining to watch. The acting of both Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix is marvelous, but what really glued it all together was the music. The amount of emotions they were able to transfer through the screen is just amazing. The dialogue is almost poetic at times, Ridley Scott blessed us with some iconic quotes. The imagery and symbolism are beautiful, especially the opening shot of a hand running through a wheat field and then the little bird which flies away and we understand the protagonist's desire to do the same. The ending is done with so much finesse and the gentle melody that starts playing when Maximus passes away awakens the deepest feelings in the audience. A true work of art.",Gladiator
1408,caressque,A fascinating picture of ancient Rome.,8,13 December 2005,"""Gladiator"" is Ridley Scott's attempt at a sword-and-sandal epic, with Russell Crowe at the helm as Maximus. And it doesn't disappoint. The picture is beautiful, Scott pulls out all the stops with scenery, costumes, weapons, and (the most important) faces. This is a country who is recovering from brutal wars against the Germanic tribes who are, at this time, trying to take down this vast kingdom.Maximus (Russell Crowe) is an instant fan-favorite. There is no growing up for this strapping military genius, he already knows his stuff. All we have to do is sit back and watch him do business. He outwits the antagonist to the point where he is in control (to understand this feet is to understand a Gladiator's position in the Roman caste). The villain, Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) plays a pathetic and sadistic young man who, much in the fashion of Macbeth, descends into darkness and uses violent means to achieve a position that was supposedly taken from him.""Gladiator"" is worth seeing. The only complaint I give is the watering down of the characters who are devoid of any complexity, Ridley Scott tries too hard to distinguish who's who. He doesn't let the viewer decide. He might as well have his characters yell out, ""Hate me! I just killed a good guy!"" It would have been nice to see Maximus show a little of his darker side to the audience. A man who is a victim of a tyrannical dictator, a man who suffered the hanging and burning of his son and wife is not made of complete honor and integrity. At least not in reality.8/10",Gladiator

Then to fight back with nothing and nearly overcome the nearly invincible and wicked system only to lose his life at the very end but to actually win yet without any pride.

He is the perfect hero archetype and it ends fulfilling that archetype perfectly. The story, whether how accurate it is to ancient Rome or not, is incredible. Even if we must view it as a fantasy film, the story would not become diluted in any way. If you have not seen Gladiator, you should go buy it at a F.Y.E or Moviestop location (it's very cheap now) and if you have seen it then I'm sure you agree with me and if you have seen it and don't agree with me, whatever, but you're absolutely wrong.",Gladiator

As I watched the movie on the screen the other day, I could not help but make comparisons all the way.  The only thing is that the General´s name was changed from Livius to Maximus, and the ensuing love affair between him and the Emperor´s daughter Lucilla.

The camera-work in the first battle scene is disorienting and intentionally blurry to avoid showing anything in detail.  The dialogue, from start to finish, is unrealistic- both on a human level and a Roman level.  If you want to incorporate historical figures into a fictionalized account, treat them as historical figures, not perversions of historical figures with the same names.  Marcus Aurelius was not a 2000 year-too-early Thomas Jefferson. Whatever Hellenistic notions of democracy the Greeks held to, the Romans repudiated until the disintegration of their empire.  I laughed awkwardly (to mask my offense and disbelief) when Aurelius lets his daughter know what an impressive ""Caesar she would have made had she been born a man.""  What utter nonsense!  Furthermore, the character of Commodus is not so much miscast as it is botched in the person of Joaquin Phoenix.  Russell Crowe acquits himself nicely in his performance as Maximus, but is his story of revenge really that sympathetic?    The computer generated Rome is impressive, but not even on a par with the Rome of Julie Taymor's recent ""Titus.""  And what is this odd, recurring cornball shot of Maximus parallel to the ground as the grass moves under him?  The production value of Gladiator is high (at times), but someone should've hired a proofreader and BS detector.",Gladiator

So why Gladiator should perfectly history accurate ???... the plot is romanced in the way to make a great emotional feel and i don't see anything wrong with it ...  At the very first moment of the movie i knew that i would enjoy it the score by Hans Zimmer & Lisa Gerrard during the battle with the barbarian is really great, we have the feeling of all the ""grandeur"" of the Roman army, its like nothing can't stand in the way of this highly technical advanced army for this time ... The brutality of the combat (a la Braveheart) is true to what it most have been during this time ... The rest of the movie is just great fight scene, special effect a very well done and not overuse and good dialogue ...

Make sure that you catch this work of art in the cinemas as it will never have the same impact if you watch on video.Gladiator has some of the most intense battle sequences I have ever seen as Ridley Scott puts masterfully puts the audience in the middle of the action. However, the movie doesn't just rely on gory battles to interest the reader. A superb script is ably supported by brilliant performances from Crowe, Reed and Phoenix(a revelation in the evil conniving role of Commodus)and Gladiator is actually an intelligent movie with a true action hero with brains as well as brawn.Up there with American Beauty as the best film of 2000 so far (UK) SEE IT NOW! 10/10.",Gladiator

The battle scenes are the best I have ever sceen they beat Braveheart.What Ben-hur, and Spartacus were in the 50´s and 60´s, Gladiator is in 2000.The visuals created in this movie are amazing, the re-creation of Rome, specially the Coloseum, something one would expect from the director of Bladerunner and Alien.I tend to divide movies into two categories, films that are really artistic, with a deep philosophical meaning and entertaining movies, Gladiator fits in this category and it earns a 10. Gladiator doesn´t intend to tell a historical tale accurately, it just intends on delivering a good story involving glory, love, treason and triumph.Overall this movie has great performances specially by Russell Crowe, great visuals, great battles, an excellent score by Hans Zimmer, a must see, recommended for anyone who loves films with great action, where good defeats evil, and for anyone who intends to have a good time at the theater.",Gladiator

Only Joaquin Phoenix was worth staying in the cinema. The movie was too corny since while there was no fight scene the actors always were near weeping, the fight scenes were too brutal and the whole movie was much too much hollywood-like. Letting the Roman Cesar fight in the Colloseum was ludicrous as well as the figure of the old Cesar - absolutly not authentic.",Gladiator

From the Private Ryan style opening battle, which makes Braveheart look like a picnic, to the genuinely affecting final death scene for hero Maximus, with a succession of stunning set pieces along the way, ""Gladiator"" delivers powerful, gripping, thought-provoking entertainment.  The acting is particularly fine (Crowe, Reed, Harris of course, but also an impressive Joacquin Pheonix) and one scene in particular goes straight into my top ten movie moments : the airship style shot of the Collosseum, as if the Cup Final were being played between Ostia FC and Capitoline Utd.

Within 30 days, the majority of europeans were able to enjoy what i consider the best film of the new millennium so far... a very special thanks to dreamworks and universal for such reasonable, customer-friendly behaviour.Would all studios bring their films to europe that fast (I hope that routine will continue with the dvd/vhs of gladiator), they'd have to worry much less about pirated video-cd's.

My friends and I were wondering after the show when Emperor Commodus said ""The fix is in"" or some such, indicating Maximus didn't have a chance in his current battle with the unbeaten gladiator (how many beaten gladiators were still around?), why the heck didn't he unleash the tigers?  Presumably, the tigers in the arena were the 'the fix' ole Commodus was talking about, right?  But no, he had slaves holding them back with chains.  If Commodus couldn't figure out that he needed to release the tigers so that they could kill Maximus, he really wasn't bright enough to be emperor anyway, right? Now, of course, I am informed that all the romans moved to England, ergo the fact that the British accent is the true Roman accent.

This movie recalls the greatness of the original trilogy. Like Star Wars, Gladiator has no big stars, opting instead for very talented actors who do not happen to be famous. Gladiator has a terrific hero and villains worthy of the name. The battle that Maximus wages is both personal and epic, and the amazing backgrounds that the story occupies create a very real world. This movie is immersive unlike any other movie in a very long time. Where Episode I failed to give the audience characters they could care about or a plot they could decipher, Gladiator keeps things simple, elegantly depicting the conflict without clutter. The plot is a combination of a royal drama similar to Shakespeare's plays, and an Anglo-Saxon battle epic. Everything works, and just as Lawrence of Arabia makes you thirsty, this movie makes your pulse pound.",Gladiator

I must admit that I was not that impressed with Joaquin Phoenix at first, but on further review, I realized that he was actually very good... his character is a spoiled simpering evil dude, and he played it to the hilt, with a British accent (because we all know English was the language of Rome, and everyone who was anyone in the Roman empire spoke with a Royal Shakespearean accent).  Oliver Reed, Derek Jacoby, and Richard Harris were wonderful of course, as was Djimon Honshou, and then there's Russell Crowe... He is definitely the heart and soul of this film, and if THIS film doesn't get him the respect he's due, then nothing will. And anyone who thought the light saber duel in Star Wars Episode I was impressive (as I did -- my favorite part of that movie) will be completely bowled over by the fight sequences in this film.  Very bloody, but very well choreographed and incredibly filmed.  AND -- this movie has a heart!

1438,Sabin-5,The summer starts with this triumphant Gladiator,9,3 May 2000,"This is not Braveheart, the war drama about Scotland's quest for freedom. This is a character study, a comic book, a video game. Ridley Scott and his screenwriters find intelligent ways to give us everything we would ever want to see in a gladiator film. It doesn't aim to teach or evoke pathos, but to entertain like the gladiators themselves. To the film's credit, it does its job admirably.Russell Crowe is back from Jeffrey Wigand and returns to raging Bud White mode. He carries the film in a breath-taking stride, even though his Aussie-accent is difficult to cover up at first. Joaquin Phoenix is the best costumed villainous fop since Tim Roth of Rob Roy.And the battle scenes are rousing, combining the violent red-throated carnage of Braveheart with the you-are-there shaky-cam of Saving Private Ryan to impression results. And the film actually FEELS like Rome, a feat that for all their glory (varying though) Spartacus and Ben-Hur haven't been able to muster up as they've aged.Gladiator is a terrific way to spend two-and-a-half hours and one of the best non-stop action flicks since Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Terminator.",Gladiator

1440,mike n,"over-blown, over-violent and historically outrageous",1,11 May 2000,"I went to see Gladiator with low expectations, going only because I have a 1-2 movie a week habit, and there have been few good movies opening in American theaters in recent weeks.  What follows, therefore, is an opinion about one hollywood summer blockbuster movie from someone who admittedly doesn't like such movies in the first place.First of all, Gladiator has the generic faults of most such movies: 1) sophisticated and expensive production design, editing and special effects contrasted with a simple-minded story, stilted dialogue and characters with incomprehensible or unbelievable motivation; and 2) excessive length.  (To be fair, it does not have the very common third flaw, excessive noise.) There are many decent low-budget movies that get by with thin plots and bad dialogue, when directed quickly with some flair; but adding money, big-name (and talented) actors and length makes things worse, not better.I find the violence in Gladiator's battle and fighting sequences very distasteful.  I had the same feeling about Braveheart, although that movie at least balanced its violence with scenes of levity.  I do not object to cartoon violence in movies, and I have never been bothered by anything I saw in John Woo's or other Hong Kong movies.  Graphic scenes of realistic violence do upset me, even more so when (as in this movie or in Braveheart) it is ""righteous"" violence meted out by the hero.Finally, I was disgusted by the movie's misinterpretations of history.  The Roman Senate was an instrument of aristocracy, not democracy.  Commodus was killed by disgruntled servants, and no one thought of replacing him with anything but another emperor.  Having him decide to fight a skilled gladiator is the supreme example of lame screenwriting in this movie.",Gladiator
1441,ROB-LOWE--FAN,"A great movie, especially the battle scenes...",10,24 May 2000,"Russell Crowe, from The Insider, delivered an Oscar worthy performance as Maximus, a vengeful gladiator.  The only thing wrong with this movie is that Joaquin Phoenix, who plays the king, or prince, or whatever, isn't as sweet or naieve as his character in 8mm.  Still, I saw this movie with two of my friends, and there was not one thing to make fun of.  If you have ever seen a group of teenage girls at a movie, that is an incredible feat.  Watch for Gladiator to win oscars for cinematography, costuming, and supporting actor. (Russell Crowe will probably not be nominated, because the academy is notorious for snubbing the ""hero"" of action films.  Just take my advice, if you like any movies, and even if you don't, see Gladiator.  It's worth it.",Gladiator

1443,Triplee,"As good as Braveheart, but cooler.",10,10 May 2000,"When I saw the first trailer for Gladiator(around superbowl time), I thought about how much potential for greatness this film could possess. In a genre that has been ignored for thirty years, it's refreshing to see a movie that will no doubt be a catalyst for a surge of new epics. Russel Crowe = bad hombre. It's one thing to see a hero who displays excellent prowess with a gun - like the protagonists we love from westerns and cop movies; it's something altogether different to see a warrior slay his enemies with primitive weapons like swords, spears, and morning stars. I won't go into detail, but the battles in this movie are phenomenal. One last element of Gladiator that makes it a different type of film than Braveheart is the computer generated imaging that makes the ancient Rome real and possible for the movie. Also, this movie will probably not win Oscars like Braveheart because people viewed Braveheart as one man's(Mel Gibson) vision.You can't not like this movie.",Gladiator

Crowe is superb as the determined Maximus, but he is matched by fight choreography and the rich CG visuals of Rome at its height. The opening battle sequence betters anything in Braveheart, although the slow motion was overused. The standout feature of the film was the depiction of Rome; from the streets, to the emperial palace to the Colloseum. It equalls anything presented in Bladerunner or one of Lucas' offerings (with the use of CG birds being on a par with the Ewoks)This is the film of the year. It does not deserve the tag ""event film"" as it is not a shody piece of work held together by some shiny computer code but a heart-pumping, sword-swinging, sweat and blood soaked masterpiece with superb visuals, intellegent script and flawless performances from the leads.see it, then put aside another 3 hours to see it again",Gladiator

It has the usual ingredients of action, betrayal, heroic return and of course some sort of victory. This film is great judged from visual and sound perspectives, but the story is rather weak which makes this movie predictable and hard to have ""feelings for"".I categorize this movie as ""American"", because it is build according to a classical recipe designed to let the whole range of feelings touch the audience. Nothing is spared in effects and the music hammers on as our hero makes his entry, why does it always have to be so ""monumental""? If played in modern time the camera should have altered between a crying audience and the american flag while playing the national anthem. I can´t stand those scenes.Despite the negativism, Russell Crowe plays his hero well and the 150 minutes passes quickly. Connie Nielsen leaves a deep impression, which cannot be said of Joaquin Phoenix´s performance as Ceasar.

He said that it was too long.  Of course, he doesn't really like movies at all anyway.  I hear about people complaining about how long it was.  They should've expected it.

I admit that the directing seemed a bit annoying at times, but that's just because I don't care much for the small bit of ""artsie"" stuff they threw in there. Overall, this is one fantastic movie.

I thought it would be good, but I had no idea. It was great. Russell Crowe plays Maximus, the great Roman general and right hand man to Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. As well written as the film was, Crowe delivers an excellent performance as Maximus, making it nearly impossible to imagine anyone else in the role. Joaquin Phoenix delivers a great performance himself playing Aurelius' son Commodus who assumes the role of emperor after his father's death in an underhanded manner. Phoenix's portrayal punctuates Commodus' despicable demeanor. This film transports you to the era in the theater. It's totally engaging and shot beautifully.

Although it's good and it takes a new twist on some of the same ideas.  I couldn't help but think about how I saw this 5 years ago with people in kilts.

I mean, I came out of the cinema and wondered why the sun wasn't already up. I thought it must have been at least 8 hours long. It's just so BORING! When you think about it, what happens in this movie? Tough guy kills some dudes. Tough guy talks about honour with old guy. Mean guy kills old guy. Tough guy kills some other dudes. Mean guy talks about honor with girl. Tough guy weeps for his family. Tough guy talks about honor with black guy, then kills some dudes. (Repeat last three lines until bored, and then some more). If they would have just stuck to the killing part, then it would have been a mediocre action film. But no, they had to add ""depth"" (=lots of ""philosophical"" (=clicheed) truisms, with about 30 seconds of pauses/reaction shots between sentences). Actually, the screenwriter packed the script with so many clichees he actually only missed one: Flavius (the nephew of the mean guy) is not Maximus's son. Bummer. I thought I knew everything that would happen after the first quarter of an hour.O.K. The good points: The first three fights or so ARE compelling (the other 20 or so cease to be). Ancient Rome never looked so real (Shame about the rest of the movie). The actors can act (their roles are just so clicheed the creators could have done with Muppets).One final question : Does Crowe really go from Germania to Spain in one day (Some horse that must be...), and from Spain to North Africa in another two? In a CART? I Refuse to have seen that. I must have fallen asleep for a few hours. It's possible with this movie. Zero stars.",Gladiator

Russell Crowe as Maximus, Connie Nielson as Lucilla, Oliver Reed as Proximo, Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius, and a host of other supporting actors.And the top actors are needed as this is a screenplay written by a team, and it lacks a unified vision. Small production errors, like Lucilla wearing a bra, detract from the authenticity. Will the audience care? When character arcs reverse without cause, will anyone notice? There is so much action, and even a weepy scene at the end, perhaps they will not care.Well worth seeing for what is good, but not for people with faint hearts.

I was disappointed - the story did not touch my heart. I think ""BraveHeart"" had a much better story and characters. I did not feel much empathy for the characters and the love story left me cold. The endless chit chat between the ""Roman"" characters was so boring with the dialogues utterly ordinary. The special effects were ok, but nothing extraordinary. Similar melodramatic stories have been seen by me ( as I from India) millions of times before. Wife, sister, parents, brother or son murdered and the hero taking his revenge. I would advise others who are praising the movies to the skies to start watching Indian movies. They will really lap it up. I also found the ending a big let down. The climax was so meek !! And I here I was expecting a big showdown between the the armies of the rebels and the emperor. Russel Crowe has acted well, but I believe any of our homegrown Indian superstars can give him a run for money in the melodramatic and action sequences. I found Joaquim Phoenix and the lady awful. The Gladiator isn't awful, but it's not particularly memorable either.

1456,PDS-11,"Rent ""Spartacus"" instead . . .",2,8 May 2000,"I had high hopes for ""Gladiator.""  This is the first Roman epic to appear in years (not counting the recently released ""Titus,"" as it is more Elizabethan than Roman), and with the promise of Russell Crowe and a large budget, I thought it would be a wonderful way to spend a Saturday afternoon. Though Crowe does deliver a fine performance, this film is crippled by a ridiculous script, delivering thinly drawn supporting characters and perhaps the worst ending since last year's ""Pushing Tin."" I admit, many of the gladitorial combats are amazing to watch, but they simply cannot support the story.  As far as accuracy to Roman customs and history goes, the filmmakers succeed in their portrayal of Roman death games as being widely varied: we see games involving animals, chained gladiator pairs, and battle reenactments (""the Battle of Carthage"" scene in ""Gladiator"" is quite powerful and darkly comic), yet, they make the standard mistake of the ""thumbs up/thumbs down"" issue in the Roman arena.  When the crowd wanted an emperor, or other game sponsor, in Rome to allow an athlete to live, they raised their hands, not their thumbs, to indicate a show of mercy.  I admit, this is a minor point, but one could imagine that the filmmakers might have done a little more homework on such issues. Incidentally, there are numerous readable and engaging scholarly works on the subject of the Roman games, Roland Auguet's 1972 ""Cruelty and Civilization"" in particular.  ""Gladiator"" contains other glaring historical inconsistencies, but I dare not mention them for fear of spoiling the ending.If you're craving a Roman epic, I would suggest skipping ""Gladiator"" in favor of Stanley Kubrick's 1960 ""Spartacus,"" an occasionally flawed, yet much superior film.",Gladiator

However for me the scenes that least required special effects i.e. the fight sequences were ruined by the addition of a bizarre blurring / juddering effect that rendered them unintelligible. Considering it is a film about gladiators you really would expect to be able to see what was going on, especially in the fights.In a sci-fi the effects can be up-front, in a film about gladiators the special effects should be invisible.There that's my whinging over. 7/10.",Gladiator

The ruler is killed by his son who wants to rule Rome.The ruler he wanted to follow him is imprisoned by the son. Son kills the rulers picks loved ones and man get angry...and what not. Its the good old revenge tale but told as an epic. The acting is good especially Crowe as Maximus.The film is visually very cool. From Rome to the fight scenes all well done. The worst scene is the begining battle. Its ruined because it was filmed in the dark, its edited to fast so you cant see whats happening, and the camera doesnt keep still. Also the ending is rather anti climatic. It leads you to believe that there is going to be a huge battle in Rome but alsa all we get is the hero and the villain dueling it out in the Colussem.Another problem that is too long. It could have a used another brawl or two its seems much longer then 2 hours and 30 mins. I never was really interested in epics of battle but i really enjoyed this one.Its got well done action and good acting thats leads to a well worth trip to the theater7 out of 10",Gladiator
1459,unger,Maximus is my hero,10,1 June 2000,"Though not unique in plot, the movie is very well done.  Most powerful for me was Russell Crowe's portrayal of Maximus.  I fully believed in Maximus as noble and honorable and would have fought with him.  It is a hard role to do so well.  The movie was gorgeous to watch, Ridley Scott crafted some very memorable scenes.",Gladiator
1460,augustus28,excellent - what can i say?,9,8 May 2000,"I knew this movie was incredibly hyped, and I knew it was going to live up to its initial buzz.  It definitely did, but I would have to say I am biased to this historical period.  However, in comparison to Spartacus and Ben-Hur I think this is a better movie - that's just my opinion.  I came in expecting a lot more Gladiator action, but was a tad disappointed by how much I got.  However the action scenes that were present were spectacular and brutally violent.  The plot drags a bit, but it can be overlooked because of Russell Crowe - he holds it all together.  Definitely a must see.",Gladiator
1461,gfunk85,It was Horrible!,10,13 May 2000,"No, the movie was not horrible. In fact, the movie itself was excellent. The music was mood-setting, the scenery exceptional, the graphics realistic, the storyline interesting and the cast outstanding.  Russell Crowe plays a general captured and sold as a gladiator after almost being killed by the late emperors selfish son. What was so horrible was the fact that killing for sport (The occupation of gladiators) was an all too real thing in ancient Rome. The graphic battle scenes in the coliseum depict the horror of what actually happened. This film is definitely one to be viewed in theater for full appreciation of sight and sound. Though not recommended for those with weak stomachs, this 2 1/2 hr movie will keep you into it from beginning to end.",Gladiator
1462,werefrog,Breathtaking visuals and historically correct,10,9 May 2000,"This movie is a one of a kind piece of film. To watch it is like enjoying an independant movie with a big hollywood budget. Scott pulled out all the stops to make this one spectacular movie. I had not seen such excellent camera work since ""Pulp Fiction."" The scenes made you feel like you were right there in the stadium watching the spectacle. Scott also brought in many of the themes that have been left out of other roman based projects. Like the incestual tendencies of the latter Ceasars. The fans showering thier favorite gladiators with rose pedals. Slave camps, and the worldliness of ROME. You could walk down the streets of Rome and see people from all over the empire.",Gladiator

The film was filled with tons of action and suspense, and yet, it kept a good plot through the whole movie. The opening scene started with a bang and kept your interest throughout the whole film. However, if you didn't like the graphic violence in 'Saving Private Ryan', this film isn't for you. This is a definite nominee for Best Picture 2000. A must see!",Gladiator
1465,drewdummer,Good film worth seeing,8,19 May 2000,Gladiator seems to me the first good film of the year 2000. Many of the people I know have compared it to be better than Braveheart. I do not agree although I feel that Gladiator is up in that league of films. It has a great story although not historically accurate. People get into the characters and there is some very good acting here. The only complaint I have of this film is that of the camera views at certain times. They can be extremely close and quick which makes it hard to see what has happened. This is true in many of the action scenes. Still I was amazed by the action and the beauty of the many scenes. This film is very good. Go see it in theater if you can.,Gladiator

These images may be computer generated, but it's impossible to see the joins!Effects without substance would not be enough, however, but ""Gladiator"" has that as well - in abundance!  The Cast have really excelled themselves with a great script - there isn't a weak performance to be found.From Russell Crowe to Oliver Reed no one disappoints.Perhaps in view of his untimely death, Oliver deserves a special mention - talk about going out on a high!A movie not to be missed!",Gladiator

Gladiator is just another big dumb movie that passes as an intelligent one.  No offense to Crowe(I really loved The Insider), but he's no Mel Gibson and Braveheart, with all it's weaknesses, is so much better than the computer-generated Gladiator.",Gladiator

Such a pity: Scott was my favorite director.",Gladiator
1469,surfsider,An Early Favorite for Oscar,10,29 May 2000,"After seeing the ad for Gladiator, and realizing that Russell Crowe was the main character, I was determined to see it. His portrayal of Bud White was what made LA Confidential transcend to another level. Finding out that Ridley Scott was the director made it 100% certain that this was a film not to be missed.From the opening of the film, with the wheat blowing softly, leading up to a battle that combined the frenetic camera work similar to Private Ryan mixed with the brutality of Braveheart all set to Hans Zimmer's great score, I was hooked.Here is a film that includes all the pre-requisites of being a hit. Superb acting from all the leads (Joaquin Phoenix - I didn't realize he could act that well!?) Richard Harris as the elderly Caesar, the late Oliver Reed, and Djimon Hounsou all did superb jobs. What MADE this film what it was though, was Crowe's performance as the betrayed General Maximus.The sheer emotion and depth that Crowe brought to what could have been a cardboard replica of a historical figure proves with no doubt that he is now one of the top actors in Hollywood.The vulnerability mixed with the intensity, with the ever underlying thirst for revenge drives the character and subsequently the film. It is doubtful one will see a better performance than the scene where Maximus discovers his family killed.
With a lavish set design, aided by stunning CGI work, the viewer feels literally immersed in the world of old Rome. The battles (the best one being the Barbarian Horde) are staged elaborately, and truly evoke the quality of what they must have been like.This movie is similar in some ways to 1995's Braveheart, yet differentiates itself enough to be truly original. It is a strong possibility that come March, Ridley Scott could be standing at the podium holding Oscar. Of all the films that have come out in the past year, this is one that NOBODY should miss!",Gladiator
1470,m_hess,a real experience - especially the music,9,28 May 2000,"I must say, that at first when I left the cinema I was not that excited about this movie. More interesting was, that it was the music that I still had in mind. But after a night to reflect over this movie, I have to say, that it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. A great plot, and although it is running about 2 and a half hours, it is never boring. Go and see it for yourself - I will do so again, too!",Gladiator
1471,stevencole1,"Simply put, one amazing movie!",10,28 May 2000,"Gladiator has everything.  Amazing visuals, superb fight-scenes, and a strong plot with a fierce revenge angle.The first part of the movie is quite slow, but concentrates on building backgrounds for the various characters.  The movie really takes off when Maximus begins his Gladiator career, the action scenes are similar to Saving Private Ryan (like Gladiator, a film that also moved me) as the pace is frenetic and very 'in your face'.Check out the scene where the Gladiators first enter the Coliseum arena in Rome, wow, you actually felt like you were there.  During the fights you will be on the edge of your seat, willing the 'good guys on'.  Apart from the action, there is a healthy dose of drama, which didn't do much for me. However, this does balance the movie quite well, but after seeing the fight scenes you just want to see more action!The ending is predictable, but quite powerful, it really does go for the heart strings, I was moved, and that's no easy thing.  The best movie I have seen in ages, Star Wars TPM had the visuals but not the story, check Gladiator out, you won't regret it!",Gladiator
1472,kabal_fx,a great tale and vision but not flawless,9,30 May 2000,"Ridley Scott has always encountered us with other worlds, he likes to create his arena from scratch, in this case the arena is the ancient roman empire, but sadly it is inhabited by more virtual people then toy story. It is a great loss that this great tale and well acted story suffers from this modern desease called cgi, the time of great masses of extra's (real people seems to be gone. now we have to asume that those awkward moving people are real, the movie suffers from it! And why does these days everybody has to have a deathwish be reunited with their family in the afterlife (startrek generations had it, end of days had it and so does gladiator) it makes it look a little bit rediculous. but the rest of this movie is so impressive that i'm still giving it an 8.",Gladiator
1473,eclaycamp,A must see - Period,10,3 June 2000,"I went into this film with somewhat low expectations.  I don't consider myself a real fan of this genre.  My first thought upon seeing the trailer was ""Spartacus.""  After more research, I was concerned this might be a cheap Braveheart-esqe ripoff.  I was wrong in both cases.  This movie is in a category all to itself, and I loved every bit of it.  I haven't experienced a film like this in quite some time ... Gotta go with a ""Thumbs Up"" in my book.  I thought that Ridley Scott did a heckuva job keeping this film moving for the course of 3 hours.  I also would say that Russell Crowe is quickly becoming one of the better actors in the business today.  His presence on the screen carried several of the movies key scenes.  I felt that the plot of the movie was easy to follow, almost cookie-cutter like in that respect, but there were enough turns and twists to keep me satisfied through the course of the film.  The effects flat out rock, I was particularly impressed with the opening sequence.  This is one that you want to go see again and again.",Gladiator

Thank God for Russell Crowe or else I would've walked right out. It's actually beautifully shot and the costumes are exquisite. I've always been a sucker for armor. It's got blood and it's got war. It's got slightly interesting sub-plots and everyone in the movie is beautiful. I have to say, I was slightly impressed by the artsiness of ""dream sequences"" and the unashamed blood bath. But, too long, too draggy and there's nothing they could do about it. It had it's moment and it's memory but I'd never see it again. It's definitely a renter -- but it would be best if you had a wide-screen televison to enjoy the beauty of the filming itself. Defintely NOT an oscar contender.

He and RC are the reasons I went to see this film. There are indeed many technical and logistical weaknesses but I believe RC's performance will carry it to a place in movie phenomenon history. The success seems to be a combination of excellent casting and artistic ability. I applaud the other characters as well. Because they are a human endeavor, I can think of no 'perfect' film. This one does what films are supposed to do, it captures the majority of the audience who sees it, touches a sensitive place in their psyche and leaves them with a fond remembrance.",Gladiator

Every character was interesting, the cinematography brings back images of Saving Private Ryan and Braveheart, and the musical score compliments the visuals perfectly.In the same year that brought Battlefield Earth to the big screen, it is a relief to see a smart, well thought of, big budget epic film do well at the box office.",Gladiator

The story is an oldie but a goodie - good guy beats bad guy.  The actors are supreme.  What more can I say about Russell Crowe that has not already been said here.  He's a gem of an actor whose ability transcends the sometimes weak script.  He manages to carry his dialogue and he is a credit to his profession.  Joaquin Phoenix does well for someone used to playing soft urban roles, Oliver Reed gives the performance of his life (except of course in 'Oliver' in which I think he is an absolute genius).  Yes its gory, yes its cheesy at times, but wow what a piece of entertainment. The music is sensational and the action engaging.  A must see at the cinema.

Wow, I can't begin to explain what a great film this was.  It managed to captivate and excite the entire time. There was humor and great pathos and insane emperors and the noble warrior with a heart of gold.  All the things that MIGHT have added up to a cheezy overblown Hollywood machine if the actors weren't so fabulous.  Oliver Reed can be proud of his final performance, one of the best of his career. Finally Russell Crowe captures a starring role where he can let his fine acting talent shine while showcasing those gorgeous looks of his.  And Joaquin Phoenix makes you both hate and feel a modicum of pity for the tortured and malicious young emperor.  It's a flick that can appeal to guys and girls (if the girls can stomach the quick cuts of violence and gore) and DEFINITELY DEFINITELY go see it!  the visuals alone of the Roman colosseum, the tigers, and the gladiating sequences are worth the admission.",Gladiator

I wish it could have ended differently, but I guess that was the way it had to end. The only part I didn't like was the opening slow motion battle scene.

1481,RyuO,Wonderful Movie about Rome,8,1 January 2001,"Based on the director and the cast, I was expecting a good action movie, great acting, and a derivative story about our times. As an action movie, it wasn't bad, but not as good as I'd hoped, the acting was fantastic all round (especially Joaquin Phoenix), but I was amazed and gratified that it was mostly a movie about *Roman* themes, not modern ones. It looks to me like the writer understood the Roman concept of Virtue, knew about Roman religion and Stoic philosophy, and Marcus Aurelius' ""Meditations"".On the downside, there were a lot of minor anachronisms and inaccuracies:1. Stirrups hadn't been invented yet. 2. The Romans used ""Greek Fire"", not Napalm, and they did not use it much as field artillery. 3. The Romans generally did not use cavalry as a decisive military arm in this period, and certainly not against the germans, who had more and better cavalry. 4. Did the Romans have tigers?! 5. If they did, the tigers would have had elementary big cat training. At one point a tiger decides to chew on Russell Crowe's armor instead of deliver the Killing Bite, or just break his neck with its paw.",Gladiator

I was glad that the movie had a story line and was not just all blood and death.  Russell Crowe was an excellent choice for the character of Maximus and should be commended on his acting.  Also the director did a fine job in making the movie and should also be commended. It is definetly worth owning or going to see in the cinema.",Gladiator

It seems like the Academy Awards aren't the best at picking who and what deserves it, just like Julia Roberts winning over Ellen Burstyn.  All she did was act pissed off and wear revealing clothes.  Many actresses could've done that.Anyway, this movie is just a bigger budget for a Jean Claude Van Damme movie.

What's the rank of Rome army? Second, the story is a fake. There really was such emperor as Commodius, but he wasn't killed on the stadium. Third, does anyone thinks that the emperor, wishing to kill somebody will stop if the folk love that person? The screenplay is written very bad.

1485,elladan,An astonishingly overrated movie,5,1 February 2001,"I wanted to like this movie.  It got good reviews, it was set in Rome, it seemed like it had everything going for it.But, unfortunately, such was not to be the case.This movie was, quite simply, bad.The plot is pathetic.  It's basically a nonsensical mish-mash of supposedly momentous events, padding up the time between Russell Crowe brutally slaughtering his opponents in various inventive and completely unbelievable ways (yes, really, those Roman swords did chop through bone like it was tissue paper, I'll believe that.)The action is, for the most part, just a celebration of the power of the filmmaker to create violence even more brutal (and at the same time, more antiseptic - lots of blood, lots of cutting, no guts) than reality.  The true core of the movie isn't character, plot, or even Russell Crowe showing off a few muscles.  It's amputated limbs, heads, torsos.  The rest of the film is just a pathetic shell around numerous scenes whose only purpose is a celebration of hollywood's antiseptic version of the macabre.  Blood, dirt, death.  But no guts.The special effects are poor.  A few shots of Rome are attempted, but they look like nothing more than CGI drawings with some legions pasted on top. Even the best attempt, an aerial flyover attempting to portray the daily life of a bustling city, is just a quick glance from a strangled camera angle, and gives the impression more of a robotic ant farm than a great, bustling city of the ancient world.Perhaps, one might think, the fight scenes fare better.  After all, they are the only reason for the movie's existence.  But they don't.  Despite being patently unbelievable and absurd, they also manage to be rather poorly shot and boring.  There's never any real vitality to them.  Somehow, Ridley Scott has managed to turn human brutality into something that looks like nothing more than a special effect, and a poor one at that.  The video jerks in a strange, stop-motion filming effect that makes each fight look like it was done in claymation, while the arena, the stadium, the crowd all look somehow smaller than life, phony, unreal.Don't bother.",Gladiator

On further examination I found this story much more compelling and complex. The gore content is tastefully done and while brutal it serves it's purpose and is not the focus but rather the motivation for the story.The acting is excellent, Russell Crowe played the role of Gladiator with the necessary reserve, angst and passion needed. Joaquin Phoenix as the Emperor's son was truly distasteful. I loathed his character by the end of the movie more than most characters I can call to mind.

Here's the outline (I would warn of SPOILERS, but this thing is already ROTTEN):1) After a great victory in GERMANY, a Heroic Roman general (Russell Crowe) and 100-year-old Roman Emperor with BOTH FEET in the grave (a pathetic-looking Richard Harris) plot to bring back the REPUBLIC to Rome.2) The Emperor's EVIL -- that's E-V-I-L -- and effeminate son (a WAY-OVER-THE-TOP Joaquin Phoenix) gets p***ed when daddy doesn't want to give him supreme power,finishes pushing pops into the grave, attempts the kill the good general, but just wipes out his family a thousand miles in SPAIN instead.3) Just after he discovers his wife and kid are TOAST, the grief-stricken good general is conveniently abducted by slavers to AFRICA, where he becomes THE GREATEST GLADIATOR EVER!, killing off dozens of opponents with each rippled bicep and impressing his teacher, played by Oliver Reed (who played with similar scene-chewing bravado in his prime).4) The good general goes back to ROME, where he wipes out legions in the Colisseum simply by ripping off his shirt to show his MIGHTY PECTORALS! Heads and arms and legs and lots of bloody parts fly all over in the MOST RIDICULOUS GLADITORIAL FIGHTS EVER!  The EVIL SON, who is now the E-V-I-L EMPEROR quakes in effeminate fear of this MIGHTY GLADIATOR, who is now the MOST POPULAR MAN IN ROME!  He suggests incest to his comely sister (Connie Nielsen), but -- strangely -- she prefers the SHIRTLESS GLADIATOR GENERAL, who promises to bring REPUBLICAN freedom to all ROME.5) The E-V-I-L EMPEROR lops off the heads of all the free-thinking Republican Senators and fatally backstabs the CHESTY GLADIATOR.  He jumps into the ARENA himself to finish him off, but our HAIRY HERO manages to end the E-V-I-L ONE's misery, and our own.Russell Crowe has a primordial presence which obviously strongly appeals to both male and female audiences, but this movie is a joke.  It says a lot when the best performance turned in was by the Oliver Reed, who died during the shooting and had a few of his scenes filled with Oliver's face superimposed by computer over an anonymous actor.The movie also looks terrible with a computer-generated Colisseum which looks totally plastic and a darkness in most of the scenes that is near impenetrable, except, of course, in the ludicrous gladitorial scenes in which every eviscerating moment is in bright sunshine.This movie is Spartacus and Ben Hur for the plot-challenged, character-challenged, nano-second-attention-spanned modern audiences.

Jacobi, of course, was the absolutely brilliant star of the probably the greatest Roman epic ever, I, CLAUDIUS.  That scintillating 13-hour classic doesn't have a single boring or predictable moment (unlike this mess) and is all characterization and plotting, not spectacle, the exact opposite of this movie, which uses character stereotypes and a ludicrous storyline that wouldn't pass the cartoon test.  Half the acting is Russell Crowe swearing revenge and grimacing as he flexes his pectorals.  Even the spectacle here is MUDDY and BLOODY.

The end of the movie recall me antic tragedies, but in some forcible way. But what i really like in this movie was acting of Joaqin Phoenix, he was better than Crowe.

The performances are good too, adding a contemporary dimension.  Crowe is commanding as are each of the supporting players.  I do not think they will rate the same way 20 years from now they will get lost in the extravagence of the film.Gladiator probably ranks so high this year(2000) because everything else is pap.

Tightly scripted the characters come to life - you sense the actors have become the characters they portray. The opening battle sequence is one of the best brought to the screen and I have seen Olivier's ""Henry V"", Kirk Douglas's ""Spartacus"" and Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"". Ridley Scott's direction, not only captures the huge scope of the canvas, he has developed the personalities of the characters and permitted them to 'breathe' and become believable, depicting a range human qualities and deficiencies.Russell Crowe's performance is so dominant (worthy of the ""Oscar"") one cannot imagine any other actor in the role. Joaquin Pheonix truly establishes himself as a fine actor and Connie Neilson, Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed cannot be faulted.I would recommend this film for anyone who loves a strong story line, fine acting and an appreciation of the cinematic art. You could not be disappointed with this film",Gladiator
1498,tlongmoody,took me away,9,12 September 2006,"This movie is one of my absolute favorites. I loved Maximus, Commodus, and Lucilla. The plot was perfect, the violence appropriate for those times. I think that the character, ""Commodus"" was one we absolutely loved to hate. But, he was weak, and really only wanted to love, and be loved. I loved the fighting scenes, so realistic. Cicero was another one of my favorite characters. Always faithful to Maximus to the very end. He set things in motion for Maximus, when he contacted Lucilla. She paid him and thanked him. I think she loved Maximus, but it was not clear that they could actually be together, if he lived. Which brings me to the only part of the movie i would've changed. Maximus, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife;who will have his vengeance in this world or the next, should have lived.",Gladiator

A General who became a slave, a slave who became a Gladiator and a Gladiator who defied an Emperor.That does not even begin to describe the intensity and excitement of the film. It Is a very much an edge of your seat movie, up until the very end, i couldn't believe it when Maximus died. This film has everything for me, story line, excellent action scenes great acting particularly from Russell Crowe who very much deserved his Oscar for this film. I cant think of a similar film that comes even remotely close to this one. To summarise the film i would rate this in my top ten film of all time, its that damn good.",Gladiator
1502,Si Cole,"Pure, exciting, old-fashioned entertainment",7,5 August 2001,"Every now and then, a film comes along with adrenaline-pumped action, first-class acting, delicious cinematography and with warm, old-fashioned storytelling charm. I believe that Gladiator is one of those films. Russell Crowe gives a memorable performance as the heroic Maximus Decimus Meridius, Joaquin Phoenix is sensually evil as the embittered, power-hungry Commodus and the late Oliver Reed gives one of his career-best turns as Maximus' idealistic trainer.The story had enough depth to compliment the action sequences and the score to the film was just sensational. One of Han Zimmer's most accomplished compositions, and one to remember with nostalgic sentiment. Connie Nielsen was also credible as Lucilla, the troubled sister of Commodus, repressed of hope by her brother's dark affections towards her. The sheer magnitude of Rome, the fight sequences in the wilderness and the battles in the amphitheatre elevate this film from the run-of-the-mill Hollywood crowd of films, and witholds a historic value to boost its credibility.I don't think its one of the best films of all time, because some of the subplots are not given the depth I would have liked, and some were given too much. The incestual relationship between Lucilla and Commodus lacked subtlety.  The ending though, is very special. I think about Maximus' ideal of heaven and I wonder how close he is to the truth.",Gladiator

Maybe my expectations were too high (hard to believe with most of the movies coming out now a days).  But I came out of the movie feeling a bit ripped off.The acting was solid.  Russell Crowe made a good brooding hero.  But my main grievance with the movie would be the total lack of originality in the story.  Basically change Maximus to a NY city cop, Rome to NY and the Emporer to a corrupt politician and you would have pretty much every other action film to come out of Hollywood.  They billed it as a throw back to the epic Roman Empire era movies like a Sparticus or Ben Hur, but it just wasn't.  Basically it was the same ole, same ole with some good acting.",Gladiator

1508,razorboy67,It's sad that this is considered some sort of classic,7,3 November 2001,"An Oscar-winning movie?  Please.  Of course, the Oscars have a history of rewarding undeserving movies, while deserving ones are often not even nominated.  I'm not sure if Traffic was even nominated, although it won for best director, how ironic.  I didn't feel this movie was anything extraordinary even by ""summer blockbuster"" standards, much less oscar standards (which obviously aren't too high these days).It's not that I dislike the movie, it was an enjoyable summer flick.  I think Russell Crowe is a fine actor, although this is hardly his finest work.  I guess the Academy likes epics, as they've shown in the past.  I didn't even find the special effects to be that great, they were often blurry and disjointed.  Overall...the movie makes no real impact on me. It's a decent enough movie, certainly not great.  A bit overly melodramatic but not as bad as some movies of recent years.  A solid if uninspired film...but an Oscar-winning classic?  I don't think so.",Gladiator

Lucilla it is an interesting character and I like her personality.I missed to see more roman locations, and the daily roman life. Each still it's like a painting. Ridley is a great artist.For me the best scenes are when Commodus kills his father and the last fight Maximus against Commodus.The soundtrack is one of my favorites congratulations to Hans Zimmer, Lisa Gerrard has a special voice that you can imagine yourself in ancient roman age.",Gladiator

1511,philipmurphy,"High quality, little content",6,3 September 2003,"WARNING - Big spoilers (but if you can't figure out the entire plot after the first 20 minutes, go back to TV)I just saw this movie on DVD, watched it all, enjoyed it as a fight movie, but felt dissatisfied.  Then came up with the following analogy.  The movie is like a 20 Oz high quality Sirloin stake.  The cinematography and fight scenes were great, but after the first 8 Oz you start to feel you have the measure of the thing, why eat the next 12?  The story was a very old one, the only question to be resolved - does Maximus kill Commodus before he dies?  12 oz later, the answer is yes.  Oh, the stake never lost its quality - the Coliseum was great, more excellent battles.  But 8 Oz would have been fine.The acting was very uneven.  Joaquin Phoenix turned in a great performance as Commodus.  Oliver Reed had the best role since Oliver.  Russell Crowe was just not there.  That he used a lot of the same tics for Maximus as for Charles Nash was odd - but this is the guy who did LA Confidential - what happened?  Derek Jacobi being saddled with the 1-d Gracchus made me want to cry - this is the actor who made I, Claudius!And it is not that Ridley Scott can't thrive with 1-D acting - he did after all, make Blade Runner with Mister Frown, Harrison Ford.  But that movie had a great, interesting, novel plot.  This one could have been lifted from any of a 1,000 different predecessors.But why is it so not compelling?  Compare to another period piece with odd accents - The Lion in Winter - lots of satisfying complexity there and Katherine Hepburn.  A story that could twist in many directions and characters that were passionate - with many different passions.  (OK - it did have an unfair advantage in screenplay from the Bard.)  But when the acting is gripping, you can overlook all the anachronisms.  And a movie motivated by the love of a woman, but with no strong female role, isn't likely to convince you of its passion.Finally (really!) there is THE MEANING OF IT ALL.  When Max is dying on his feet, but gives(!) democracy back to the Senate (Gracchus), to fulfill the wishes of a dying emperor(!), what are we meant to take from this? Hopeful interpretation - democracy handed over at the point of the sword has as much chance of living a long life as the dying man handing it over.  Pity President Bush didn't see that.  More likely interpretation - there is no deep meaning.  Ridley Scott thought that if you do a little regime change and ""hand over"" democracy, then you have yourself a Triumph.  Hmm, perhaps President Bush did see this movie this way...",Gladiator
1512,Hot_Wheels,One of the most overrated films of the decade....,3,7 June 2002,"When I first watched this movie, I was expecting everything it promised: ""A Spectacular Historical Epic From Ridley Scott"" But after seeing it, I can't understand the reception it got (four Oscars!). As far as I can tell, it was a botched attempt by Mr.Scott to create a historical epic of Braveheart proportions, and since Mel Gibson turned it down in favor of The Patriot, took the next Aussie in line, Russel Crowe. But the casting is the least of the problems, as the story seems derivitive and uninspired, which usually leaves it to the special effects and editing to carry the film. Sadly, even these are quite amature and ineffective. There where many times I couldn't believe I was watching a Scott film, for a tight picture and perfect visuals have become his trademark. If you want my opinion, don't even waste time on this failure, there's much better ones out there. 1/10",Gladiator

1517,jperrone-1,One of the all time greatest,10,21 January 2007,"I remember going to the theater the first time with tempered hopes. I ended up seeing it fives times in the theater alone. Then I burned a hole in my DVD afterward. Ridley Scott proved himself once again to be one of the greatest directors of all time, and this movie helped me to discover Hans Zimmer as well. I also think this is Russel Crowe's definitive role, and Joaquin Phoenix's performance absolutely floored me and turned me into a huge fan of his. Just a fantastic movie, with an absolute heart break ending. The recreation of Rome gives you the feeling that you are really there. Some of the cinematography, such as the scene where Commodus is looking out over Rome, just before screaming to his sister ""Am I not merciful?!"" is just unforgettable. Hans Zimmer's score is absolutely unbelievable and I've basically burned a hole in the soundtrack CD as well.",Gladiator
1518,Cali_Dude1,Are you not entertained?,9,15 December 2010,"Ben-Hur, Spartacus, Quo Vadis - that was when they made movies as big as cities, proper, meaty, swallow-an-afternoon films. Well, what may have been out of vogue for 40 years is making one hell of a comeback. In the grandest tradition of them all, Ridley Scott, together with man of the moment Russell Crowe, has enriched the legacy of sandals, swords and leather wrist things to create a magnificent epic. Hammering on all the touchstones of yore while utilizing all the tricks the modern filmmaker has to hand, this is hardly subtle, but its impact is absolute, its performances loud and clear and its ambition all up there on screen.Commencing with a full-scale, extras unlimited, realism unabated battle sequence in a mud strewn Germanica, we are confronted by a general tired of war and an emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), near death. Furious at the bond between Aurelius and his beloved warrior, his unhinged heir, Commodus, kills pop and condemns Maximus to death. Big mistake. Especially when you kill his loving wife and child, whom he yearns to for, by burning and crucifixion.And so the plot follows Maximus rise as a gladiator - trained by a remarkably vociferous and effective Oliver Reed, whose face is peculiarly CGI'd in certain scenes from beyond the grave - driven by lust for revenge. In the meantime, Rome is in turmoil with the nutty new emperor, played with gleeful vindictiveness by Phoenix, attempting to dismantle the Senate while his doting sister Lucilla (Nielsen) seems to have other plans. And just to make things more complicated, she happens to be Maximus' ex.Russell Crowe was clearly born in a hard month, in a hard year during a freak outbreak of total hardness. The man exudes the physicality of a wild animal. Shifting testosterone like a pure-bloated Brando, he holds the screen with such assuredness and force you simply can't rip your eyes away from him. When he looks furious (as he does for 90 percent of the time), the movie possesses its own gravitational pull.Ridley Scott was also the man for the job. His trademark visual panache - making everything seem utterly glorious no matter how brutal or gritty - presents the events on a truly epic canvas of filtered light and ancient landscapes. CGI has recreated Rome's massive Colosseum and the gore splattered combat sequences therein are literally stunning - the face-off between Maximus' and his gladiator brothers and a stream of chariots in mid-arena makes a mockery of Ben-Hur's fabled race sequence, and utilizing Private Ryan-esquire frame-jumping techniques gives the fighting a tangible realism that crashes out of the screen.There is an interesting if token commentary on the use of violent entertainment to subvert the masses, but on the whole, historical accuracy is reserved more for the technical elements than any sense of political, religious or dialectic truth (accents are all over the shop). The film also bobbles in its need to cram so much politicking in, to draw in an empire in crisis to the more personal story of one man's revenge.Courtesy: Empire magazine",Gladiator
1519,sanreb187,An example of Perfection,10,15 May 2011,"One among my favorite movies.. it stayed number 1 on my list for many years replacing Braveheart and sliding it down on my list until is saw ""Saving Private Ryan""Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders. Connie Neilsen is gorgeous in the Movie and a real treat in the eyes. Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotistical persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator. ""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant – and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie;The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy.The ending is just awesome. it was simply emotional.

Ridley Scott brought out the best of Crowe in Gladiator, and his all round performance really felt as though he'd taken the time to research his role.A heart felt story line (loss of family) and the 'father-son' relationship with the Emperor really makes the viewer want Crowe to win in this battle with Commodus.And even with the film lasting well over 2 hours, I could have easily watched more.

1523,bovaldi,Great Russell Crowe vehicle,8,20 March 2012,"I will admit that ""Gladiator"" is a very good movie, but I'm amazed at how many people gave it ten out of ten stars. I know standards fall as time goes on, but that's a rating that should be reserved for a movie that will stay with you for years to come. All About Eve is such a movie; so is the Godfather. This isn't going to be one.Don't get me wrong, it's great to see old pros (Reed and Harris) and relatively new pros (Crowe, Phoenix, Nielsen, and Hounsou) go through their paces; Crowe in particular is better than I've ever seen him before. However, the plot is well worn, the dialogue occasionally lapses into silliness, and the CGIs bother me. I can remember a time (was it really only two decades ago?) when filmmakers who wanted a mindbogglingly spectacular set built one--they did the work, they spent the bucks, they expended the sweat. The CGI Colosseum seems like cheating, somehow, and several other shots are so obviously faked, they detract from the action.Speaking of the action, it is quite good. Scott has definitely lost none of his knack for tense pacing; I was surprised to see that two hours had gone by and I hadn't even felt them. The fight scenes are not only believable, which isn't even remotely a given in action movies, they're so entertaining they inspire not only excitement but a vague sense of guilt. And after being weaned on the mega-buff steroid stallions of the 80s and early 90s, it's very nice to see the athletic but not Conanesque Maximus in action.All in all, a good flick, but I'm pulling for Traffic or Crouching Tiger to take home the gold statues.

1524,emmaclarke781,Death smiles on us all...,6,8 August 2012,"...all a man can do is smile back.In a way that line sums up this movie.On the surface it comes across as a simple action thriller... and it is, in many ways. The dialog is stilted,the story unoriginal,the character's archetypes, the political commentary unsubtle and the ending predictable.But what transcends this film is the undercurrent themes of hope, despair and loneliness.For example, the film's villain Commodus at first seems like your typical villain but Phoenix shows us a lonely,scared,love-starved boy capable of kindness and worthy of our empathy.In his scenes with his sister Lucilla the two actors lift it away from just being about incest to a study of a relationship of poignant dependency.Lucilla half hates her brother -and deep down he knows this- but he overlooks this because he desperately needs her.Lucilla too is a lost soul, revealed in a line to Maximus:''I have felt alone all my life,except with you.'' The film says one crucial thing about human nature-our capacity for enjoying the pain of others. We are watching people watching people die. And we enjoy the death and violence as much as the Romans did. But the film's ending offer's some-perhaps unattainable-hope and is, in a odd way an affirmation of life.What Gladiator doe's best is bring to life a world now lost. If I ever go to the Colosseum in Rome, I will not now see the rows of empty seats but hope,terror,hatred,cruelty, small kindness,desperate courage,and even heroism..in short.. all Humanity.",Gladiator

This movie is worth watching again. This Is a good movie that also displays what things were like in ancient Roman times.",Gladiator
1533,aravindb,Probably the best war movie of all time,10,11 June 2017,"Ridley Scott's magnum opus is a specter of epic proportions- both in terms of visual treat and acting prowess. Crowe gives his best ever performance, and is the perfect portrayal of a leader- calmness in eyes during planning, intend while attacking and ruthlessness in killing, and a man who lost his family- haunted by memories of his wife and son. Joaquin gives a stirring performance as Commodus. The subtle hinds of mental insanity, raw lust and incest adds to his mysterious nature, with the hatred to him increasing steadily through the movie. Connie Nielsen as Lucilla gives a steady performance, but the portrayal of her fear of Commodus is outstanding. The emotional scenes- between Aurelius and Maximus, Maximus' first battle as a gladiator and the climax sequences- could have been overdone by glorification of the hero, but Scott does an immaculate job in creating the feeling in audience, probably by the portrayal of Maximus as any man, driven solely by his loyalty and purpose above desire.Music by Zimmer and Lisa Gerrard is instrumental in completing the feel of Roman era, with the final ""Now we are free"" being absolute goosebumps material, though on hindsight, I did find some similarity between the Pirates of Caribbean ""He's a pirate"" and the war theme. Nevertheless, I don't find any reason why it should not be given a 10. A must watch film for all.",Gladiator

I watched both versions - the long and the short one, and I have to say that the short version of the film is no doubt better. It is like with many other films. I find that this movie shows real character, amazing battle scenes which do not take the attention away from the narrative. I liked being immersed in an epoch I know nothing about. I don't know if it is historically correct and I suspect it is not, but still it is a beautiful movie about real (well, in fact fictional) heroes, how can you go wrong :) Of course I will recommend this to others, to kids and grown ups alike. Nicely done work. I am giving it 9 out of 10 because of the longer version, which was on the verge of boring.",Gladiator
1535,MovieGoofey,My favorite movie EVER,10,8 July 2005,"OK, my first ten on this site, but for what a movie ! Normally I have problems watching films more then once, but this one I can not get enough of. This movie has everything: first class acting, scenery, emotions, love story, action, etc. etc.The music and soundtrack totally fit to this movie and I love to hear it again and again. The story of a man almost defeated, to fight back to try to take revenge on his defeater, has been done before. But not in such a totally COMPLETE movie.Russell Crowe IS gladiator. He exactly fits the gentle hero model (as we can also see in other movies featuring him, like Master and Commander, and more recently Cinderella Man). But all other actors are also casted fittingly and play their parts well.Go see this movie (again and again), because it will totally immerse you in a world of 'strenght and honor'.",Gladiator

When Caesar's son finds out, he grabs power for himself with brutality. Maximus gets away but is sold into slavery, ending up as a gladiator in Rome, where he fights his way to the top and confronts Caesars son. Russel Crowe as Maximus won best actor for his role in this movie because of his use of emotion to try to regain his title and get out of the arena alive. In my opinion it is one of my favorite movies due to the gory fighting while also following a plot line where Maximus needs to find revenge for what Commodus did to him.",Gladiator

1541,BenNicholson123,"If I Could Give This Movie 11/10, It Would Be A 12!",10,8 November 2005,"Gladiator! A thrilling tale of a Roman general who must battle against all thinkable odds to avenge the death of his family and restore justice to the empire. The plot is simple, legendary general Maximus Decimus Meridius, after many victorious campaigns and battles wants to return to his peaceful home in Spain, However the kind, fair and dying Emperor Marcus Aurelius wishes to bestow his title on him over his cruel son, Commodus. Commodus is understandably annoyed and kills his father calming the title of Emperor. Maximus is sentenced to death along with the rest of his family back at his home in Spain. Maximus escapes but is unable to save his wife and son. His loss of will to live makes him an east target for slavers and he is soon sold as a gladiator. He fights his way into the coliseum in Rome were he wins over the crowd and uses his celebrity status to defy the Emperor, to whom he swears his vengeance for the death of his family, after many battles and political backstabbing he gets his chance to fight the Emperor in the Arena.This is just such an amazing film, it captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve, we can go on for whole scenes without the need for speaking, everything is told through the genuine body language and expressions. And when there is conversing we get such emotion and wonderfully powerful quotes  ""What we do in life, echoes in eternity"" Wow.The opening scene is spellbinding, showing the true gore of battle, the fight scenes are marvellously realistic, discarding the popular ""pretty"" sword fighting for brutal aggressive force. The audience in the arena express every emotion, surprise, anger, and enjoyment. The cast is brilliantly chosen; we can really see Russell Crowe as a gladiator, in Commodus, Joaquin Phoenix gives us a man we can really hate, Connie Nielson shows real emotion and passion in the role of Lucilla. So apart from the spellbinding acting, scarily realistic fight scenes and the amazing script, what else can we look for? The music is just stunning, its exactly what we need brought in at exactly the right time, truly wonderful directing. And then we have the stunning special effects, we can really visualise the greatness that is Rome, the fight scenes really make you believe. Some critics have condemned the lack of historical fact, for instance an emperor would never fight a gladiator, and these comments cannot be denied, its true.But I think we can forgive them that one fault for such an amazing movie. Without hesitation I give this movie a truly deserved 10/10!",Gladiator

1546,elliotsillander,Well acted anti-historical mess...,6,26 March 2020,"Gladiator is a well beloved film that is a fact. I can see why too. The acting is great! Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix deliver terrific performances and the cinematography is certainly not bad. Even the directing is quite good which it should be coming from the brilliant Ridley Scott. I mean I love Alien, Blade Runner, American Gangster etc. I was expecting something really good but all I got was a mediocre epic.Enough praise though there is plenty wrong with the movie. A) Historically this movie is false beyond belief... In real life Commodus wasn't evil, fire arrows never flew from the sky, helmets werent chopped like they were made out of wood and nobody was swinging around two spathas at a time!!! B) The movie is overlong, unoriginal and bland. C) The story is poor and mostly a romanticized adventure straight out of the mind of a ten year old.All and all it isn't a horrible movie by any sense of the word but it also isn't anywhere near being a masterpiece or even one of Ridley Scott's better movies. Watch it if you like unrealistic stories and fantasy movie because that is what it is. Certainly not History...WEAK!!! 7/10",Gladiator

1548,tonymcmahon-36789,The return of sword and sandals!,8,12 October 2018,There was huge excitement when Ridley Scott decided to revive the sword and sandals genre that had been dead since the early 1960s. Gladiator was truly epic and gripping. It didn't really revive the genre in retrospect though we had Troy I suppose. My only gripe was that Scott edited out scenes that were longer on dialogue and shorter on action. Might have varied the pace and added more depth. Great to see veteran actors like Derek Jacobi chewing the scenery.,Gladiator

Not a perfect movie but definitely intense and with such a power and impact it destroys every weakness in the screenplay.",Gladiator
1555,Tanya-3,A truly magnificent film,10,26 May 2000,"I didn't make any comments until I saw this film twice as I wanted to be sure I wasn't just overwhelmed on first viewing.  But the second time confirmed my feelings - this is a wonderful film.To those who don't think Gladiator is an epic - I'd almost agree.  It is really a very personal story - that of Maximus and his desire for vengeance against the Emperor Commodus.  The grand scope and effects in the film are really there just to underline this fact.  They do this very well - the opening battle scene is huge and the scenes in the arena are wonderful (but if you can't stomach blood - don't go!).  The scale of the film is epic with an excellent recreation of 'the Glory that was Rome'.The casting was generally good - concentrating especially on classically trained Brits in supporting roles.  But the real focus of the film IS Russell Crowe as Maximus.  He is on screen for most of the film and I can't imagine anyone else playing the role - he is the soul of the film and if he hadn't done such a good job the film would have been a disaster.  He portrays Maximus' grief and rage superbly - in words, looks and gestures (I don't think I've ever seen anyone act so much with their eyes before...) You will not believe how menacing the line 'I will win the crowd' can be until you hear it.This should be the role that finally gets Crowe the recognition he deserves. He should have had Best Supporting Actor for LA Confidential, the Best Actor this year was a very tough category.  Next year there shouldn't even be a contest - I don't think that anyone will dominate a film as much.",Gladiator
1556,Richard-54,Disappointing to the maximus!,1,19 May 2000,"This film is stunningly bad.Russell Crowe is so wasted here.  And Connie Neilsen could be beautiful so much more entertainingly somewhere else.The sound is muddy, the effects attempt what they can't deliver, and the script is so relentlessly incredible that not even Crowe's acting and Neilsen's astonishing good looks can rescue it.The initial battle scene, like so many, is ridiculous.  The opposing forces are cheaply miniscule.  The Romans chose laughably bad ground (downhill from the enemy!).  And the ease with which the Romans position there cavalry behind the opponents is absurd.  It was nice, if incomprehensible, to catch Scott's homage to the great film, ZULU -- the Germans seemed to have the Zulu battle chants down pat.Most annoyingly, Scott seems to think that an occasional spray of blood and a sickeningly jostled camera equals Big Action.  More like Mild Nausea.  We see much of this, alas, later in the movie, too.OK, so we grant a little geographic and medical license to Maximus as he rides, wounded, across much of Europe, to find his family murdered.  But from that moment all credulity must be withheld.  Since when does a Roman citizen place himself in jeopardy of being impressed by slave traders just because he makes the grave error of being unconscious?  It might have made more sense if he'd woken up belowdecks on a British ship of the line in the 18th century.The climax of the film, though momentarily pleasing in the accuracy of its downbeat rendition of one's chance of succeeding in a plot against a Roman emperor, once again dismisses credibility: Commodus thinks he'll do better against a genuine heavyweight than Johnny Friendly did against Terry Malloy. Or imagine Al Gore suggesting that he and George Dubyah settle this thing mano a mano.  Same idea.  Puh-lease.The film was kind of a pagan BEN HUR, but without Jesus, the horses, the (real) crowds, and any significance whatever.  And it lacked, especially, a crazy emperor like Caligula of the ROBE movies, played in his film debut by the brilliant Jay Robinson (""Messalina!""). Too much post-modern dysfunctional family stuff among Scott's Caesars.Yuck.",Gladiator

And there was a lot of cheering, as the movie was filled with outstanding, original action sequences.Weighing in at close to three hours, this movie tried to be an ""epic film,"" but failed.  It featured all the standards: the love interest from long ago, the wise old man, the ambitious son, the black sidekick, the ""we must work together"" speech, a man fighting for revenge, etc.   And it's all very good, but not great.Go to the Colisseum , see the bloodshed, cheer.

But the story of ""Gladiator"" woke my intrest and there i was, at the cinema, with my low expectations.This was exactly the kind of movie that i´ve been waiting for! It got all of the parts to make this a classic; action, love, betrayal, hope & misery. The one thing that impressed me the most, except from Russell Crowe´s fantastic performance, was the beautiful world that was brought to life by stunning scenography and computer effects.This is a ""must see movie"".

It wasn't bad, it was TOOOOOOO much and TOOOO loud!!  I think there was all of five seconds that didn't have soundtrack.

The characters are bland and one-dimensional. It is a B-movie in comparison to great Roman movies like Ben Hur and Sparticus. The only saving graces are the special effects, and Russell Crowe's big name. Russell Crowe wasn't even that great in this movie, he only carried the monicker of 'Next big actor'; the Hollywood flavor of the month.So now, just like Titanic, it has road it success all the way to the Oscars and will probably win when other quality movies like Almost Famous, Wonder Boys and State and Main get snubbed.

Blade Runner had that wonderful atmosphere with rays of light slanting through windows, and in Gladiator he manages to do the same with outside scenes! My favorites: the initial battle scene in the German forests and the short sunrise scene in Rome. Absolutely brilliant settings and just powerful images.However, the cinematography is not all that stands out in this movie. The story is well-told, the acting great, everything comes together just so. The counterpoint of the stoic, down-to-earth Maximus Decimus Berilius (Russell Crowe) vs. the corrupt, slimy Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) trying so hard to out-do the image of his father is perfect.I have to give this one: two thumbs up! ;]",Gladiator

1565,morgoth-5,An allegory within an allegory,10,6 May 2000,The last battle to secure Rome's frontier belies the turmoil within; Ridley Scott is stating that it is easy to be fractious and divided when there is no common enemy.  The crowds cheer the return of the fights to the death and glorify violence.  Are we not individuals in a different kind of coliseum watching a spectacle of violence in a time of relative external peace?  This event marked the pinnacle of the Roman empire and the beginning of its demise.,Gladiator
1566,Gennyfer,Disappointing.....,5,7 May 2000,"The fight scenes and such were spectacular.  It was a visually lush movie. The acting, especially on Russell Crowe's part, was excellent but if they are going to spend 100M on a movie couldn't they have channelled some of those funds into a decent script with believable characters.And I am always willing to suspend my disbelief but when it comes to historical movies I appreciate a little more accuracy.  For instance: Marcus Aurelius DID with the last of his strength (supposedly) declare Commodus to be his heir in front of the army.  And Commodus did quite often enter the arena as a gladiator but, it wasn't until about 10 or 11 years after he became Emperor that he was poisoned by his mistress and died. Though perhaps not as truly depraved as Caligula, Commodus' true history seems to have been interesting enough to have fledged a much more well rounded script, with a greater depth of plot.I went to the theatre expecting the kind of feeling experienced from viewing BraveHeart I was definitely disappointed.",Gladiator
1567,boobless,Great Special Effects = Not-So-Great Script,6,1 February 2001,"The opening sequence is worth the price of admission alone.  As a student of Latin History, the CGI quality beats any drawn representation of Ancient Rome, and the Coliseum never looked better.  (But why does every CGI landscape artist opt to include a flock of airborne birds?  They never look right and almost always distract from the focus of the shot.)  Visually, the production team earned their credits and I give them kudos for their costumes, props, and above all, the true-to-life gladiator battles.But all that doesn't make up for the cheese-eater of an ending.  Director Ridley Scott has created a legacy of amazing films, most of which are science fiction-based, and maybe that's where Gladiator should be categorized.  The script is fairly solid except for one MASSIVE flaw.* SPOILER ALERT *For wanting to create a visually stunning, seat-gripping historical action film, why absolutely discredit the validity of the entire piece by having the most important person in Rome (at any given time) killed in the way chosen.  NEVER in the history of Ancient Rome could such a plot occur.  To have us believe an emperor of Rome would enter the arena, under any circumstance other than to award the victor, boggles the mind.  The film which was great-up-to-now totally unravels at this moment.Post-viewing, three simple alternatives came to mind.  One, keep the scope from being so grandiose.  Rather, use another general or a politician as the antagonist.  At least blur the historical lines by using a lesser-known Emperor, not Marcus Aurelius.  Hey, it worked for Caligula.  Two, design the story more akin to David Lynch's Dune.  The similarities are abundantly present, but maybe that's what opted Scott's direction.  Three, and this is my favorite idea, let the hero die WITHOUT ""saving the day"".  After all, the most popular form of theater in Ancient Rome was tragedy.I rated Gladiator at 6.  It deserves watching, but has problems too severe to ignore.  It begins with heart-pounding action and political intrigue, but ends as heroic-tripe.  I'd rather watch The Fall of the Roman Empire.",Gladiator

Nothing could be further from the truth.A conspiracy of glorious photography, inspired direction and a powerfully immaculate performance by Russell Crowe transports the audience to ancient Rome.   And the journey is immersive, visceral and compelling. ""Gladiator"" is a rivetting story of treachery, tragedy, deception and revenge and is made memorable by unforgettable performances by Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, Connie Nielsen, Derek Jacobi, et al.Joaquin delivers as Commodus, a simpering, treacherous psychopath with an apparently unfulfilled lust for his sister Lucilla and a penchant for over-vigorous paternal hugging. Ollie Reed (RIP) gives a cracker of a performance as sports agent, Proximo, whose catch cry should be ""show me the denari"".  He literally throws his clients to the wolves.But all the acting accolades should be showered on Russell Crowe. He thrives on the pressure of appearing in nearly every scene, a burden which would demolish a lesser actor, and he is absolutely mesmerising.  What a talent.

The film is more of a dramatic story than action.  Unfortunately, the story is somewhat lacking especially when compared to Braveheart.  Another disappointment was the choreography during many of the action sequences. It was very hard to follow and could cause some to have a seizure.

Well, all my expectations were met, every cliche in the book was there and the worst part was that they were not even performed well. The whole movie tries very hard to radiate grandeur and epic heroism but it just totally fails. Acting was crap, most actors were statues talking without intonation while Crowe walked around the whole movie looking worried and silly and not like the heroic general he was supposed to be.. Music was junk (didn't expect it at all from Hans Zimmer, normally excellent..). The whole movie just didn't have the atmosphere it could have had.

A big budget, a big director, an up and coming star, a summer release date, etc, etc.  But in my opinion, it falls just short.  Despite what you may have heard, this movie is predictable, slow, and corny.  The fight scenes themselves are stellar, even fantastic, but they are few and far between.  The majority of this movie deals with a whiny Joaquin Phoenix and his incestuous lusts and obvious motives.  Russell Crowe does well with what he's given, but most of the best scenes involving him involve so much CG background and action that it ends up taking away from the acting, as was evident in another so called summer blockbuster ""The Phantom Menace.""  The violence is overboard and gratuitous and the movie moves like molasses.  Overall, I say thumbs down.  Give me real action over CG action any day of the week.",Gladiator

To be sure, Gladiator is a bloody and at times violent film.

1575,azmoviez-2,Blown opportunity,3,9 June 2000,"This movie had some good points but overall it was a boring action movie. The beginning was increadibly film and dramatic (I still wonder what happened to his dog).  Then there are two hours of slow parts with three minutes of gladiator fighting in the spurts.  The gladiator scenes themselves are full of choppy views and MTV style cuts.  This is a disgrace that people are comparing this movie to the classic epics (Sparticus, Ben Hur).  Even the special effects were only decent.  Russell Crowe was a bad ass, but one performance does not make a movie.  Actually make that two Damon (last name?) was great in it too.  Overall a big disappointment.",Gladiator

Russell Crowe is just brilliant and puts in another oscar winning performance. This man can't put a foot wrong at the moment following his huge success in The Insider, although it took me a while to realise it was him as i am sure it will you. A good comeback also by Ridley Scott, who directed it well after a disappointing and not such a great effort with G I Jane. I just couldn't get enough of this film. It wasn't too long or too short, but i can see why the female of the species may not take a liking to it, as there was vast amounts of violence and blood which for me made it better, along with a terrific story line and a heart warming end.

The characters all had pretty good backstories, and you never really knew what was going to happen.But I did see a few mistakes...one at the begining, at the battle scene, before anyone had even shot an arrow or swung a sword, they show a close up of the barbarians and they have arrows all around them.  Another mistake were the Tigers...now I know I couldn't have been the only one to notice this, but if they were so vicious and so mean why does it show them laying down after he let that other guy live?  And another thing wrong with the tigers was that they were on chains held by slaves, now after a while wouldn't you think the tigers would realize that they could go get the slaves?!  Hum...I'm not that looks for every error in a movie, but these stood out big time.Hehe, im getting all off subject here, but this really was a great movie and like I said it have everything and the characters stick in your head, it also had one of the best endings I've seen in my opinion.Final rating: 9/10",Gladiator

Obviously dear Ridley was corrupted by nowadays techniques of film-making. I have rarely seen such a poor content wrapped into high-tec sceneries and excellent photographing. Dear Ridley simply didn´t reflect about the message of this work of blood, mud and tears: cheap heroes and a nearly fascistoid philosophy. Do we really need such matter or isn´t it better to look forward and forget about those primitive revenge stories. And by the way:  I cannot accept this way of falsifying historic facts.",Gladiator
1580,insultcomicdog,Hell of a ride,9,2 May 2000,"A combination of all the best parts of Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart, and The Lion King, Gladiator opens, carrying itself like the great Roman war machine portrayed, then grabs the viewer and drags them through the story of Maximus.  His adoption into the gladiator lifestyle is almost as intense and emotional off the battle field as it is on.  Where Braveheart called for the audience to laugh or be shocked by the images on screen, Gladiator carries a much more personal feeling to their battles (mainly due to the size), allowing them to rile up much more emotional steam that has ever been seen in a war epic.  A veiwer must wonder as they watch, is it right that I support the brutality, is it right that I am rooting for a man to kill another?  It's quite an emotional movie, wait until you see it.Despite the moral conflict, the movie is still amazing.  Russell Crowe is, as always, amazing, and Joaquin Phoenix has turned what is probably his best performance of his career.  Ridley Scott's directing is excellent, keeping true to the worn, hot, aged feel of a gladiator movie, while at the same time, incorporating many techniques to heighten the experience, going inside the minds of the characters.It runs around two and a half hours, not too long for a Gladiator pic, and is naughtily entertaining.

The film never gave you a moments peace but moved relentlessly toward the ending. The landscape scenes (regardless of how they are created) are breathtaking. It is a story of war between armies and individuals. A surprisingly good job is done on filling in personalities and motivation without bringing the story to a halt. I came away with two overall observations.While watching I kept thinking of other films. Try Viva Zapata or Rollerball for similar plot lines. I also got the impression Rome might have dissolved over sport at the coliseum and there were many parallels between Rome and the USA at present.But, the important person to watch is Russell Crowe. Mel Gibson broke in with action films like Mad Max and evolved into a very entertaining actor. Crowe is well on his way in the same direction.Academy Award time should have this film in the running for more than one category.",Gladiator

They attempt to push lenghty ten minute monologues on our materialistic existence or the superficiality of mankind down our throats.  What these movies and directors and screenwriters behind these movies fail to realize is that 98.9% of the world's population could care less about being enlightened.  When I sit through a 3 hour movie, I want it to be entertaining.  I don't wanna shell out 8 bucks to be preached at. Gladiator is the perfect example of a movie that the majority of moviegoers want to see.Gladiator has it all: a villain, a hero, a king, lots of gore, and beautiful cinematography and direction.  While not being a breakthrough film or a one of a kind masterpiece, it's got all it needs.  People want to see movies like this.  They want that adrenaline rush right before a fight scene, they want to root for the hero, and they want that instant feeling of gratification and pure elation when the hero wins, no matter how strong the forces against him are.The hero in the movie is Russell Crowe, and he's great.  The rest of the cast was good, but the one person holding this entire film up is Crowe. And why shouldn't he?  The movie is centered around him.  This movie is exactly what he needs.  He's gonna become a household name.I give this movie a 10, not because it's one of my favorites, and not because it's a masterpiece (because it isn't), but because it embodies what a film should be.  It's not superficial or preachy.  It's just a good old-fashioned story delivered to us in a beautiful package.

It is undoubtedly the most realistic portrayal of Roman life that has ever been in the movies.Russell Crowe is a revelation. In a sea of wonderful actors, he carries the movie. Any army would follow his Maximus into battle. I will now have to go back and look up his previous work and see what I have missed. All of the actors including Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris and Connie Nielsen are wonderful.The photography is flawless and you can hardly notice the effects.The ending is a minor flaw in the movie.

1587,rlnelson,Its a joke that this film is up for an Oscar,2,28 February 2001,"Oscar material? Hardly.  Gladiator is at best a ""B"" level action flick. This film is filled with endless scenes of gore and mayhem, which hardly constitute acting.  It is the typical B level flick with tension building to the inevitable encounter of good guy and bad guy, which good guy obviously wins. Crowe walks around for 2 hours and 35 minutes with a semi-pained expression, but not saying much and certainly not acting. A further disservice of this movie is the way it warps history.  Marcus Aurelius died of the plague. His son, Commodus, ruled for 12 years and although he was insane and  did enter the arena, he was murdered elsewhere.  The final Germanic wars of Marcus Aurelius were fought on the Danube frontier and I don't know how you go from the Danube to Italy via a desert, unless you're miserably lost.  Which is sort of the theme of this movie.  People see this and think they're getting a history lesson rather than just junk.  I can easily think of ten movies this past year which had more meaning, intellectual content and stronger acting than Gladiator.",Gladiator

1589,mrb9,Amazing...but missing something,9,9 May 2000,"I approached Ridley Scott's Gladiator with an enthusiasm for spectacular visual effects and a testosterone-pumped craving for carnage along the lines of Saving Private Ryan meets Ben-hur. However, upon actually viewing the film, I found that there is much more at work here. Of course, Scott is no Joel Schumacher and Russell Crowe isn't a Schwarzeneggar type, so this came with only a minimal amount of surprise. To address my initial hopes, Gladiator does harbor a variety of extraordinary images. The Roman cityscape is worth the price of admission in itself. Although some shots exhibit that ""too bright"" look that a lot of cgi effects have, the majority of scenes are composed with convincing authenticity. But forget the settings. Let's talk about satisfying the ""I want to see brutal murder and dismemberment"" desires of most moviegoers. Don't get too excited. As far as the blood and guts go, it seems that all of the battle sequences were cut in extremely short takes thrown together with shaky-cam perspective(I'm guessing they were trying to avoid an NC-17 rating). The bottom line is: in most shots, you really can't tell what is happening except for traces of red derived from spraying blood and the occasional death scream. I understand some things are in bad taste, but when you are depicting the gladiator ""sport"", the exploitation of death is the center of entertainment. Points off for that one. Also in poor form is the editing of the film in general. Gladiator is either an edge-of-your-seat roller coaster ride or a soap-opera paced drama and never falls anywhere between these two extremes. There is simply no transition. So what you seem to be left with is two films: a Mad-Max-style, kill 'em all hand to hand combat action flick on one hand and an expensive period piece character-study on the other. It's not that the performances are bad. It's just that there is essentially very little plot, so the actors have no means of developing their characters other than in face-to-face emotional monologues. Which brings me to the overly-dramatic-at-points score. There is a scene in the beginning of the film where Commodus and his father discuss the future of Rome. It entails Commodus communicating great frustration to his father through an emotional out-pour. The scene is acted adequately, but the music is laughably out of place and you feel like laughing at Commodus rather than understanding his plight. Aside from that, and a rather weak ending, Gladiator is, by all means, a must see. It runs over older sword and sandal epics with a 4-horse chariot (ok, that was pretty lame...forgive me).",Gladiator

A hero, his wife and children, death of his family, a new lover, powerful enemy, the rise of goodness and the fall of evil. Only thing what was missing is the dog of a happy family. What a cliché. The beginning was promising; the battle against the barbarians was convincing and realistic enough, but then... rubbish. The drama was hilarious, and the fights turned into sci-fi. Later in the movie happened the climax of the disappointment, the blast of (good old American) morality, when Crowe should have killed the other gladiator but was way too good-hearted. After killing thousands of barbarians and dozens of other gladiators he felt merciful. The rest of the movie was about as boring as ""Titanic"". Take my advice, and save your money, this film is a success only in USA, that tells a lot about any movie.",Gladiator

This movie had a lot going for it, an excellent lead actor in Russell Crowe, great costumes, and beautiful scenery. What disappointed me about it was the use of familiar plot lines that are in almost every other film of this genre. A murdered family, so the hero is driven by revenge. A crazed leader in Mr. Phoenix as Commodus. Gee, I've never seen the son murder the father before to get control of the throne. And the downfall of this really long picture was the lack of action. Hey, I think the fight scenes were great, all four of them. The rest was machismo talk. Besides, if you know your history, you walk in already knowing that Rome never becomes a republic again, and the senator Gracchus meets a horrible untimely death.

Right from the start, the action scenes get your full attention. But don't let Gladiator's rough exterior fool you, there is a soft, lovable interior to this classic masterpiece.  Maximus is driven by the love for his wife and his son.  Action scenes are dispersed throughout the movie to keep the action fanatic busy, while Maximus' constant longing to meet his wife and child will move the more sensitive viewer.  Maximus influences the masses, from a quite large Germanic man (Ralph Moeller), who I call Tiny, to an African slave (Djimon Hounsou), to the attendants at the Colliseum.  The stories of these individuals, and the turmoil of Roman politics also play central roles.  See Gladiator.  Enjoy yourself.",Gladiator

I am saddened that Russel Crowe won his oscar for this movie, as opposed to his excellent ACTING in The Insider. Crowe was great in The Insider because that film showed that he can ACT in many different situations, as opposed to him showing how he can try to get revenge. I think that this will be remembered as a great action movie. This was a good movie because it was grand and it was big and flashy, however some of the other movies that were released in the year 2000 were good movies, because they had meaning, substance, and they were powerful films. These movies were good for reasons other than their special effects and their director and stars. I did not enjoy this movie because I was disturbed that this film won best picture as opposed to Requiem For A Dream, which was a powerful and groundbreaking film. I do not think it was the best picture of the year, no offense to anyone involved with this film, but.. that is my opinion.",Gladiator

Well, you've probably seen this movie and you're thinking to yourself, I don't see how someone could say that...  And on the surface, the film does have two redeeming aspects...  the cinematography, which I must admit is awesome, and Russell Crowe in a little blue dress.  However, this beautiful, big-budget movie lacks one seemingly minor, but key element: a substantive plot. Although excessive violence, a forced hero, a sexy heroine, and a stint with incest may look like the makings of a great film, Gladiator would only measure approximately twenty-five minutes if you removed all the fight scenes.  You could probably get more plot from watching the Superbowl than watching this film.  In the first ten minutes of the film you know exactly what will happen in this movie and how it will end.  We've all seen this movie before with a better leading man, a smarter heroine, a crueler and more tyrannical ruler, and an actual plot.  It's called BRAVEHEART and it won five, count 'em FIVE Oscars!  This piece of trash that calls itself a movie is not even fit to be considered Braveheart's little sister.  First of all, Maximus Decimus Meridius (Russell Crowe) is not there to save his people.  He's there simply to get revenge on Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), a ruler who's only concern is lifting the skirt of his babalicious sister, a woman who just happens to be madly in love with Maximus (shocker there). Why does Maximus want revenge?  Hmm, because his beloved wife and son, people who are barely in the movie and hence receive little pity from the audience, are savagely butchered.  Haven't we seen this before?  So Maximus is forced to fight for his life.  Yada yada yada.  This lasts about two hours.  He does the usual stuff...  He kicks ass, makes adversaries into friends, and shows off his shapely legs in a little powder blue dress... most fetching.  Then obviously, he faces the odious Commodus in a final fight scene so that he may unleash his terrible wrath.  Woo.  And he is, much like William Wallace, killed and reunited with his dearly departed. Filmmakers today think that they can pass off a movie that everyone's already seen as something new by dazzling them with sparkly lights and flashy special effects.  I'd like to point out that basically everything from Braveheart, even the Australian-accented Russell Crowe trying to be Mel Gibson, has been replicated but as with most copies, it ain't as good as the original.

Braveheart is easily one of the best movies of the nineties, and Gladiator is right up there with it. A moving story of a general who becomes a slave, a slave who becomes a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor, Gladiator stuns and amazes. A magnificent spectacle of a movie, Ridley Scott has another motion picture masterpiece notch on his belt. Gorgeous sweeping shots of a flawlessly computer generated Rome make you gasp in awe, and the battle scenes are nothing short of spectacular. Russell Crowe turns in a typically impressive performance as the general-slave-gladiator Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix is excellent as the young, impetuous, and tyrannical Emperor Commodus. The supporting cast is marvelous, with standout performances from Djimon Hounsou as Juba the slave, and Connie Nielsen as Lucilla. Galdiator is definitely THE movie to see this summer.",Gladiator

Also, some of the dialogue was quite bad, which decreased the value some as well.  Plus, the villain, Commodus, did not strike any sort of fear in me at all, or at the very least, respect.  Last time I checked, the villains (esp. of movies such as this) were supposed to strike terror in people's hearts, but all this guy does is whine incessantly like a little girl, and I don't know about you, but little girls don't scare me.  However, even with all these faults, the movie is still quite good and I'd recommend seeing it. However, if you want a superior epic movie, see Braveheart.",Gladiator

The story grasps you and even though you could probably guess the ending there are a few moments when everything is thrown into doubt and it makes a great experience for a Friday night. I found the two and a half hours flew by as I was enthralled by the excellent action scenes within the Colloseum and the breath-taking scenes of Rome and the Colloseum are what computer effects should be used for. Ridley Scott has once again gone to a genre and brought it something fresh.

After the first scene, I knew I was wrong.  This movie blew me away.  It had everything you could possibly wish for in a movie. Character development, which is sometimes lacking in movies where violence is overwhelming, was incredible.  The main character, Maximus, shows significant signs of perseverance and endurance throughout the movie.  I am not going to say what he does or how he does it because I want EVERYONE to see this movie.  I know, I'm some people have said ""oh it's too violent"" or ""it was so gory.""  Honestly, I think every slash of a sword was necessary. The producers did not attempt to tone down what would really have happened in a Roman-Empire style battle.  Actually, I enjoyed everything they threw into this.  I couldn't help having a great time watching some of the intricate fighting scenes.

It never occured to me to take tissues to this movie, but I wish I had.
On a separate note, as dark, bloody and gripping as this movie was, the most disturbing thing I saw was at the end.

1607,simon-229,A wonderful adaption to a traditional storyline from the inspiring Scott and Crowe,10,28 May 2000,"The story revolves around Maximus, a noble leader who is chosen by Marcus Aurelius himself to take his place as commander in favour of his dysfunctional son Commodus.  Commodus then murders his father and sends Maximus to be executed.  Maximus survives the forthcoming execution and flees in search for his family - who he finds hung in his home town.  He then rides forth to become a gladiator to avenge the sinister Commodus. There are some fantastic battle scenes but what makes this better from all the CGI'd sci-fi films is content and depth.  Commodus loves his sister for more than just being a sister (reminiscent of Star Wars) and some of the minor characters are executed with precision.  Russell Crowe was believable, realistic, well hard and quite frankly a master in his role of Maximus, Joaquin Phoenix lacked edge but delivered as the sinister Commodus and the late Oliver Reed played a final memorable performance as Maximus' trainer. Ridley Scott's direction is awesome.  This movie shows what CGI effects should be used for.  Although gory, this is not disturbing - this is deep and portrays a powerful and awe-inspiring message.  Best movie of year 2000 so far.",Gladiator
1608,ceeller,Wonderful historical fiction.,9,16 May 2000,"Wonderful historical fiction!  People who have taken Latin will enjoy the sets, scenery, and costumes.  While some things are not and cannot be accurate to actual history; it is still a wonderful tour of the ancient world.  It really shows how much we lost in the Dark Ages.Very few bumps in the road from acting, all in all an enjoyable 2.5 hours. Rather bloody, but c'mon, it's a gladiator movie!",Gladiator
1609,braderic00-2,Amazing!,10,17 May 2000,"I am aware that if a movie makes more than $16.50 at the box office that everyone's supposed to call it corporate Hollywood crap and find fault in it, but I was VERY impressed with this film.  Of course I was amazed with the effects, but I also thought it was extremely well written and acted. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Phoenix portrayed their characters extremely well, with Crowe playing the hero to perfection and Phoenix being the perfect brat with moral issues.  There was a great deal of violence, but I found it to be used well in the story.  Go see it!",Gladiator
1610,Buccaneer45,The first classic of this millennium.,9,9 July 2000,"If I have to sum it up in one line, I'll say this movie is Spartacus with better effects and, forgive me, better acting. I don't know if the movie is correct as far as history is concern, but taking in account the effort put in, I would rank this movie a classic. The first classic of this millennium. It's refreshing, it's timely,as I am sure there are many who are beginning to feel that the movies of today have little to go by if not for sound and effects.  I want to say, ""Well Done!"" to Mr Scott, Mr Crowe and to all involved in making Gladiator a gem. So, who said they don't make movies like they used to? They do, and (forgive me again), they're beginning to do it better.",Gladiator
1611,joedabear,"An epic tale,...",10,21 May 2000,"When I went to see this film, I half expected some formula film that had no substance. What I found instead, was a film that had a rich fabric of story, love, loyalty and determination.Maximus was a person of repute who wouldn't break his word to a friend or an Emperor. He wouldn't change his belifes just because the new Emporer could decide his fate. When it cost him his family, he was ready to give up, then he realized his chance was to become a Gladiator, not just any one, but the best. he showed what could be done if you had the trust and respect of people who would otherwise only work for their own reward.This is a powerful tale of what one man can do if he so choses. An Excellent film and well worth the price of admission.",Gladiator
1612,benedick,Excellent!!!!!,9,23 May 2000,"Gladiator is the best movie that I've seen so far this year.  I worried about being disappointed by it, but I knew from first scene that I was in for a real treat.  The battle scenes were outstanding.  Every shot was like lightning, giving you a feel of what hand-to-hand combat must be like. Scott handled the gore extremely well, too.  You see blood, but it's not slow motion, throw-up from all the disgusting gore.  You THINK you see more than you really do. The characters are well thought-out and surprisingly complex.  Maximus is tormented by his lost family, and his personal bounds of honor.  He kills because he has to, in order to seek his revenge and/or survive.  Even with all that you think Maximus is, there remains an air of mystery about him, largely due to Crowe's brooding charisma.  We still don't know all that goes on behind that sloping brow.  Commodus is deliciously evil and complex. Yet, we feel that all his conniving and his wickedness stems from his longing to be loved, first by his father and then from his people.  He doesn't want to destroy Maximus; he wants to be him, for Maximus has the love  of the people and of the Emperor.  Commodus' unnatural affection for his sister Lucilla stems, again, from his longing for his father.  The Emperor Marcus Aurelius loves Lucilla; Commodus projects the love he is denied onto the child that their father loves.  Lucilla is a good example of a head-strong female ruler, much absent in epic films.  She knows what she wants (Maximus), yet in keeping with the times, she doesn't force convention if it is not in her or her son's best interests. The only problem I had was that of Maximus' and Lucilla's past history. I think that, instead of having them be past lovers, that they could have been friends, with Lucilla being attracted to him, but never acting upon it until now.  It never followed up enough with the backstory that was given, and I think this would have been a better, and easier explanation. On the whole, I give it two thumbs up. My friends and I already declared it that after the opening scene.",Gladiator

That so many people ate it up and loved it is a credit to Ridley Scott. I sit alone however on the other side of the fence. He who wins the love of the people, wins Rome. I get it already!I was hoping that the fight scenes might save this movie but I found Mr. Scott's MTV-style editing style to be distracting. Instead of the nitty-gritty fighting of ""Rob Roy"" or the impressive scenes in ""Braveheart"", we got a lot of flash to cover up for the lack of substance.Only Mr. Crowe and his charisma  and impressive Coliseum shots saves this film from a ""1"".",Gladiator

Well how wrong an i, with Gladiator he has gone back to the days of 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner' where he knew exactly how ro gage the visual impact.  Scott has done with the sword and sandles epic, that he did with the sci-fi genre breathed life into it.  I highly recommend this to action fans, as well as to anybody interested in flims and film making, there are some glorious touches in this piece.  My only downside would be the length a tad long in places might not be to everybody's liking.  Anyway only a small downer, on what is a true blockbuster of a film.",Gladiator

Far be it for me to say that they have got it wrong...everyone is entitled to their own opinions after all.I, however, think that some of the acolades given to this film are not warranted.  It is a very entertaining film, and some of the camera work and effects are superb.  But is it a magnificent film that should be in the top 100?  No.  Check your brains at the door, go in looking for a bit of entertainment, and an interesting story line, and you will not be disappointed.  Go in looking for cinematographic brilliance or a life changing event, and you will be sadly disappointed.This film deserves a solid 6/10.",Gladiator

1620,tina_johansson,The Best Movie I Have Ever Seen,10,17 March 2001,"Gladiator is fantastic. As a movie buff I have seen a thousand movies, but none of them can quite compete with Gladiator. I'm too young to have grown up with sword and sandal epics, but I have seen most of them on television, and I was very excited to hear about Gladiator when word initially got out. Now, almost a year later, I have seen the movie 10 times and it keeps getting better. Russell Crowe is amazing. His screen presence is so dynamic that it almost blows you out of your seat. He doesn't have to say a word, just look at the opening sequence with the bird, and you'll know what I mean. He has the audience hooked from the second he walks on screen and right 'til the end. Ridley Scott has made an epic without comparison. The special effects alone are a feast for the eyes. The cast is fantastic. Joaquin Phoenix who I before hand only had seen in ""8 MM"" was amazing as Commodus. I hated him for everything he did to Maximus and still I pitied him - he just wanted something he had never had - love. As a Dane I was also thrilled to see Connie Nielsen as Lucilla - the rumours about Jennifer Lopez trying out for the part made me laugh - only a woman with Connie's regal stature could pull of the part of sister, love interest and truly politically interested without making any of it look fake. That woman has my utmost admiration. I can't wait to see her next movie. The plot is believable - and heartmoving. As a viewer you feel for Maximus as you make the journey alongside him for a painstakingly two-and-a-half hours. But when he reaches the end, you know it was the only way to end the movie. If Maximus had survived, as he did in the early script drafts, the movie wouldn't have had the same impact. As he dies, he joins the ranks of heroes who, after performing their tasks, goes to the great beyond to join their loved ones. For some reason, seeing Maximus shag up with Lucilla wouldn't have given me quite the same rush as the actual ending of the movie did. Hands up for a Kleenex moment. I've always loved a good cry - and this movie provides it - along with some memorable laughs and smiles, for my part mostly courtesy of Mr. Crowe. And if you don't like Roman Epics, see it for Russell Crowe. The man deserves his following - and an OSCAR - if I had any say in the matter.",Gladiator
1621,js-37,Maximus,9,2 June 2000,"This one's a powerhouse. The opening of the movie with a blitzkrieg says it all...General Maximus looks at his soldiers and says 'What you do in life will remain in eternity',before he leads them to one of the most memorable battlefield scenes made in movie history....these moments linger in your mind as the movie unfolds into a larger than life epic. Well crafted and beautifully delivered with a great soundtrack evokes a terrific moviewatching feel. Rusell Crowe is General Maximus turned slave turned Gladiator..no denying that...his fierce menacing eyes says it all..what a performance by him and rest of the cast. Great come back vehicle for RidleyScott. Not to be missed!!",Gladiator

I fully expected to see John Cleese selling Otters noses in the arena, and is that really Big Gay Al running the theatre? Manages to keep your interest (it had better - it's a long film) but is a bit lacking in gore. It's a film about Gladiators for goodness sake so a little less mawkishness and a bit more of the old blood and guts wouldn't have gone amiss. It doesn't have to be Texas Chainsaw Massacre but it doesn't have to be Asterix either. And Oliver Reed is fantastic so yah boo sucks to any director who worried about working with him.",Gladiator

1632,stefanie.lebek,The second time it's even better!,10,25 July 2000,"I have seen the Gladiator twice and it was even better the second time (which says all about the film). The parallels to Ben Hur (another of my favorites) are extremely strong: the good guy vs. the bad guy, both important persons, both of the same age, the goodlooking but not flashy hero of unwaivering moral integrity, who never lets fury get the better of him (even if provoked), who loses everything he has in life (both lose their family, both lose their status, both become slaves) but nevertheless regains happiness (Ben Hur not only finds his sister and mother but also christian faith, Maximus meets his wife and son after death, another reminder of christian faith.) For all these common aspects, Russell Crowe gives Maximus enough personality to create an entirely new hero.I think the plot is well written, the story intense, the shooting and the computer graphics great. 2 1/2 hrs pass like nothing. I especially appreciated the lack of the nowadays nearly inevitable (but in most cases not only superfluous but also boring) sex-scenes and the happy end that left Maximus with his family and not (out of character) with a new (or old) love.",Gladiator
1633,cyykeen,A Hero Has Risen...,9,24 July 2000,"And his name is Russell Crowe. As Maximus, Crowe is incredibly masculine, heroic and charismatic, yet human, believable and sympathetic. His performance powers this movie in a way very few actors are capable of. When he finally achieves his initial goal, the true goal of every man's heart, all you can do is weep with joy. Gladiator is a much welcome return to artistic form by director Ridley Scott, maybe his best work yet--and that is saying a lot.",Gladiator
1634,kevin_sawyer,Funny in a way,2,4 September 2000,"This film is drivel.  But it's kinda funny drivel, like when a five year old kid shows you a picture he drew, and its a terrible picture, but you laugh because it's cute that a five year old is proud of his terrible picture. Ridley Scott is the five year old in this case.  Of this nearly 3 hour long film, I would say a good 20 minutes were landscape shots, with a poorly mixed musical chiming in to make them seem important.  Speaking of the score, that battle theme music (again poorly mixed) is more than slightly reminiscent of Gustav Holst's famous ""Mars"". This film is derivative in so many ways that it hardly matters, but why didn't they just use that piece instead of paying some guy to imitate it? That opening battle scene was the most poorly filmed sequence of events I have seen in awhile.  The cinematography is pretentious and irritating throughout the film.  It's truly terrible, but it seems that everyone involved genuinely wants you to take it seriously.  That makes for good camp at least.  I would like to point out one irony.  The film criticizes Commodus, and the Roman empire in general, for attaining wealth and power by providing trashy entertainment for an unintelligent mob, who love every minute of it.  Well, Gladiator is certainly trashy entertainment, and judging from the user ratings, I'd say the mob loved every minute of it.",Gladiator

The first ten minutes alone made my heart pound, and I was hard-pressed to keep tears of amazement back.  The film only got better from there.  Everyone involved deserves an oscar.

1638,uclub3,Overrated and over-computerized,5,20 September 2000,"I saw Gladiator at a sneak preview in New York and I must admit, I walked away disappointed.  I felt that the battle scenes at the beginning were too computerized and pixiliated--they just zoomed by so fast that the audience did not have a chance to see what is going on.  Someone later made the comment to me that, ""Well, isn't that how you would experience a battle?"" And I would have to saw, I don't know, I've never been in one.  But compared to the opening sequence in ""Saving Private Ryan"" (not a perfect movie, in my eyes, but the opening battle scene was far superior to Galdiator's), Gladiator's battle was all whiz-bang, wham-bam, with no emotion.  I whispered to my seatmate that it was too pixiliated and he whispered back, ""That's how they cheat,"" which pretty much summed it up.As went the opening battle scene, so went all the gladiatorial scenes--all speed, no substance.  I couldn't even tell how the Russell Crowe character won some of the battles, they were whipping by so fast, with such fake, fake computerized effects. To compare, a couple of days after seeing Gladiator, I saw Sparticus on the big screen.  There is only one gladiatorial battle, yet it is much more exciting, suspenseful and real than any of the Gladiator scenes.  I CARED what happened!On a postive note, I did think Joaquin Phoenix's performance was fantastic, as were all of the performances. The computerized amphitheater was also pretty cool looking. Too bad the film makers felt that the computer could somehow take the place of realisticly choreographed gladiatorial fights.",Gladiator

It's one of those three hour movies that seems like it's an hour long and you're disappointed that it has to end so soon. There is never a dull moment thanks to the outstanding direction of Ridley Scott. The cinematography is equally amazing as is the performance of Russell Crowe. The story is riveting, thrilling, captivating - yet plausible. It has all the ingredients of the perfect guy movie: a villain that you develop a seething hatred for, and a hero with such courage, strength and conviction that you can't help but feel his every pain, share his every emotion, and admire the hell out of him.

As they started chatting MAXIMUS, MAXIMUS, I found myself ringside, hoping Rocky knocks out Drago.  And can anyone want to defeat the bad guys without killing off the family?

1643,toansiok,"""Gladiator"" has got everything a great movie should offer",10,14 January 2001,"First of all, I'd like to mention that I didn't go to the cinema to watch ""Gladiator"" because I'd thought it was only another high-action spectacle with an oversized hero, set in ancient Rome. However, I'll never forgive myself for that mistake, or will forgive Dreamworks for putting so much emphasis on the no-doubt impressive fight sequences (in fact, the trailers rather deterred me from watching this film earlier). It almost made me miss one of the finest movies that in my opinion has ever been produced.The strength of this film is to my mind the fact that it beautifully combines the action part with a good story, a rich dialogue, beautiful shots (with and without CGI) and, above all, excellent actor performances not only by Russell Crowe's portrayal of the title-hero. Likewise, the movie itself is well-balanced because the hero is counterbalanced by an equally convincing ""villain"", who is brought to life by an absolutely marvelous piece of acting from Joaquin Phoenix. Of course, there might be some smaller detail that could be improved (though I honestly couldn't put my finger on it), but then, who cares? This movie has got well-developed characters, romance and tragedy, deep-running emotions and sheer violence, touching and intimate dialogues and grandiose views, no one could seriously ask for more in a movie of such scale. In any case, this is most certainly more than films like ""Braveheart"" and ""Titanic"" have to offer, plus, in Gladiator you've got a Joaquin Phoenix to admire who alone makes the film worthwhile for everyone who appreciates first-rate acting!

Although not historically accurate from a biographical point of view - it is extremely accurate from the poor gladiators point of view. Yes it happened exactly as the film depicted. The untold slaughter of these poor souls was carried on with Super Bowl style hype for generations for the amusement of the general non-slave citizenry and its patrician class.The acting is good, the plot sound, and the scenes displaying the ancient way of life accurate.

1653,hunterl-73275,Gladiator Rocks,10,9 May 2019,"Throughout my life I have watched many movies and there are few that I could compare to Gladiator. Everything that makes up the movie contributes to why this movie will be one of the best ever, such as the great plot, character struggles, acting, and historical setting. When I watched this movie the first few times, which has now been years ago, I remember being so embedded in the plot and how the story was developing that I was becoming to feel as if I was in the movie myself. I felt this way mostly because of how well the movie follows the guidelines of what I think the requirements of a good action/adventure/drama should be. While the movie does specifically target people who prefer action, fighting, and history, it can be satisfying for almost everyone because of how well the movie is done, and it shows by the sheer numbers and accolades Gladiator has.
Gladiator released in 2000 at the start of the 21st Century and was under the direction of Ridley Scott, who in 2015 directed The Martian, and is well known for being one of the best in the business. Along with the directing is the amazing acting, award winning acting. The main star in this film is Russell Crowe, who is a widely known actor nowadays because of the films he has been in such as: Noah, The Water Diviner, 3:10 to Yuma, Robin Hood, etc. The other main cast members include Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harris. These five actors did such an amazing job and their performances did not go unnoticed. In total there were 102 nominations of Gladiator for numerous prizes, from Russell Crowe winning an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role to Ridley Scott getting nominated for Best Director. Out of the 102 nominations it won 59 awards; from the Golden Globe Awards, Academy Awards and BAFTA awards. Before Gladiator dominated all of the award shows of 2000, it became the fourth highest selling movie of the year domestically, and is credited with revitalizing societies interest in ancient Greek and Roman Culture.
In order for a movie that is a drama/action & adventure to do well it needs to accomplish certain things. One of those things is character struggles in both internal and external ways, and I really believe that the way Russell Crowe acts as Maximus is what solidified this. Throughout the movie there are numerous struggles that Russell's character faces, and with each one the audience is getting closer and closer to the edges of their seats. Another thing that makes Gladiator one of the best is the plot, and it begins to start twisting almost as soon as the curtains open. When Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) is murdered by his son Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), Maximus (Russell Crowe) is arrested because the Emperor wanted him to take his place and not Commodus. While escaping his captors he gets brutally injured to the point he can barely ride a horse, but he must face a long ride, so his family won't meet the same fate he was supposed to meet, execution. After seeing his family murdered, the extrinsic journey of Gladiator really begins. I like this because that is a justifiable reason for revenge through death, and the writers of the movie know this, they appeal to everybody's pissed off emotions that we all felt watching the movie. The only reason this movie is one of the best is because it is the type that you love, but that you hate to watch, because of how well the film puts you in the point of view of the character, and all of the emotions and drama that he faces throughout this film.
Gladiator is one of the best movies ever released because of the acting, plot development, character struggles and historical setting. It isn't easy to make a masterpiece of a movie that is historical and not completely accurate, but this Cast and Crew is basically like a dream team or an all-star team because they pulled it off and can claim they have one of the best movies in history because of it. If you have not seen this movie yet I recommend seeing it as soon as possible. Not only will you be impressed by the splendid acting and story, you will feel as if you are actually watching a real story unfold in front of you. If you are curious about ancient times and love really good dramatic movies, watch this movie and the story it tells, you will not be disappointed.",Gladiator

I was pleasantly surprised to see that it wasn't the case. 'Gladiator' was a very visualy rewarding film, it was probably the best technical achievement that I seen last year, but on the other hand for it to get an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture was a little much. I believe that it no doubtly deserves to clean up the technical Oscars, but just because it is visually a great film, I don't think that makes it one of the best films of the year. I said the very same thing about 'Titanic' which was an amazing technical film, but to say that it was the best film of the year, or in some cases I heard some people say that it was the best film of the decade, was ubsurd. Just because you spend a lot of money on a film does not mean that it makes it a great film. I feel that it is the same case with 'Gladiator.'

1661,ayeshakapadia,This review contains spoilers... it is a close analysis of the opening sequence of the first scene.,8,14 May 2006,"The general who became a slave; the slave who became a gladiator; the gladiator who defied an emperor. Striking story! ""But now, the people want to know how the story ends. Only a famous death will do. And what could be more glorious than to challenge the emperor himself in the great arena?"" When a Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by a corrupt prince, he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge. Director Ridley Scott uses the contrast of light and dark; peace and war; good and evil to make a unique opening such as the one in Gladiator.Unusual, dramatic, historic. How many films open with historical facts? Not everyone was happy; not everyone likes politics; not everyone is in favour of the Caesars. Gladiator opens dramatically with the appearance of four small paragraphs written in Roman Calligrapher of gold indicating that ""over one quarter of the world's population lived and died under the rule of the Caesars."" It gives the audience an idea of the past; what it was like to live under the reign of the Caesars! According to the word 'died', it was very unpleasant. This is definitely not a fairy tale story. Set ""in the winter of 180 A.D.,"" one obstacle ""stands in the way"" of Emperor Marcus, who wants nothing but ""victory and the promise of peace through the Empire"" fulfilled.The use of close-up of the hand hides the identity to which the hand belongs to. Touching the wheat of the harvest, a part of the body is feeling the pride of an unknown person, satisfied with its field. The sunlight in the background suggest the time of the year: spring or summer. Light is associated with good and the golden tinge makes it seem like a memory or something heavenly, making the surroundings look golden. Or perhaps, the gold was shone because of the fully grown wheat which symbolises there's hope for the world and the young generations. The growth could suggest life and fertility. A wrinkle hand touches the life of the wheat; the wrinkle itself could suggest the age of the unknown identity and by touching the soft wheat, he establishes a memory. The ring on the finger of the wrinkle hand signifies the marriage or engagement of the unknown identity, and the silver suggests his wealth and status in the society of the Roman Empire. It is a sentimental value. Lastly, the black of the sleeves is very symbolic as people believe it relates to death and when there's death, there's a funeral. This person may have returned from a funeral or perhaps it his favourite colour.",Gladiator
1662,wmchinn33,Maximus waste of effort,3,16 March 2001,"Those who applaud this movie do so for it's excitement and action. Those who denounce this film focus on the derivative plot, lack of character development, campy special effects, and sub-par acting. I choose to be with the latter group.This film is worth seeing, in the theater alone, but please don't expect a masterpiece. Gladiator's massive decor is entertaining viewed on a large screen, but that's where the film's success ends. The plot took quite a few ideas from BraveHeart, Spartacus, and other epic period pieces of the past, but in this case, had nothing new to add. I would like to stay away from the comparison's to BraveHeart, but the similarities between this film and the former Oscar winner is too common.  Another highlight of the film is Phoenix's character, Commodus. If you don't already know, the commode's namesake was this Caesar, so you can basically conjure up the outcome of this evil emporer.I highly recommenend this movie if you enjoy 'neat' fighting scenes and 'cool' special effects.

With staggering battle scenes on the battlefields and in the collesuem, this film was absolutely the definition of a great epic. Crowe's performance deserves an Oscar for Best Actor, though I am sure they will give it to Tom Hanks or Ed Harris, which is fine by me.  I am sure Crowe will get his Oscar in the future sometime.  Richard Harris's role as the aging emperor is also good, and should have been noticed for Best Supporting Actor.

But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present.

1665,cinehed,Best picture?!?!,2,11 March 2001,"I would never say that the Acadamy Awards mean anything, but still I must say that I take a perverse pleasure out of watching the whole affair. Ridley Scott's Gladiator will most definitely go down in history as one of the most gaudy, inept pieces of commercial pap to come down the tube in a long time.  In terms of films that have been nominated for Best Picture, it will rank right up there with Cimarron (and that won!).  Have a little perspective, people--there were some great films made this year, and this is an ugly little movie.  With barely the inclination to turn its own lens on the idea of our modern audiencing of violence (a theme that would seem pretty obvious, and fairly easy to follow up on), Gladiator is another example of our movie going cultures' willingness to be spoon-fed every little detail, and unwillingness to be the least bit reflective.

However, a great film it is not nor will it ever be (let's see what history has to say). The script is horrid and predictable. Crowe does his job, maintain a dark and quiet intensity throughout the film (much like L.A Confidential, a projection that he did even better in that film than in Gladiator). The character of Commodus, with all of his flaws, was perhaps the most inept bit of scriptwriting I have seen (in a film that is supposed to be of high quality with great writing). Some have said that he lets down his guard and shows us a pitiable side (and a depth of character). There is nothing that comes across as pitiable. He wallows in self-pity, and when combined with his depravity as a human being, there is nothing there to like, nevermind find sympathy for. The script took an easy way out by giving us an antagonist that is far too easy to hate. If there was anyone deserving of a ""best supporting actor"" oscar nomination, it was Richard Harris as Marcus Aurelius and not Joaquin Phoenix. All in all, it was a good film, fun to watch, not quite as nice on the tv screen as the movie screen, and definitely not deserving of a best picture nomination (take off chocolat and gladiator (saw all 5 nominated) and put up Almost Famous and Billy Elliot for the award...now those are great films and worthy of the honor).",Gladiator

1670,robwe359,some errors in the film.,6,29 March 2001,"Warning: some spoilers ahead!My personal impression of this film is that it is a good film, but I wouldn't have given it so many oscars as it got(my choice there would have been the Ang Lee film instead). Let me explain. The movie is set in a very realistic roman environment and its clear that the makers of this movies intention was to make it feel as a genuine part of roman history. I don't think the movie quite succeeds on this point. If you look below the surface the typical American stereotypes are even so present. Like for example when Maximus says ""Bring em hell on my command"". Its really ludicrous that such a line is in this move. Its just like something that Sylverster Stalone, Bruce Willis or some other American macho-hero would say. Lines like that fit in their particular genre but here its really silly and I am not even sure that the concept of ""hell"" was invented at the time the story takes place.Its really hard to pin down the exact details where the sterotypes shine through but they are present. Instead of being pictured as a person with many sides the emperor is pictured as an althrough evil person. Just like the standard ""badguy"" in any standard hollywood action movie. When the emperor cheats by stabbing Maximus with a dagger we are supposed to get the impression that the people view this as a very injust thing to do. I'm not so very sure that the morale of that time really worked that way. Why would the people care about a gladiator? And why would an emperor fight a duel with a slave? That seems just like something an American macho-emperor would do, nothing for a civilized roman if you see my point. Anyway too much of the American culture shows through in this movie in subtile ways. This makes the movie less interesting than it could have been. I guess the American audience will never notice this and maybe thats why it got so many oscars. To me it was entertaining to see once but nothing more than the fantastic scenography and some music in it is worth remembering. All in all it adds up to grade 7 in my opinion.",Gladiator

It was not only visually stunning, but the characters and the feel of the movie made you actually feel as if you were really there. I gave this a ten, and (if you haven't yet) once you've seen it you will too. I will admit that it is wildly graphic, but I like how it really gives meaning to the word ""combat."" The movie (to sum it up) is about a general named Maximus. This is in ancient Greece/Rome. ""Ceasar"" (not the (italic) Ceasar, but...) knows his life is ending but wants to crown Maximus Ceasar, instead of his (I think I will be...) son. His son then overthrows his dad and becomes Ceasar.

From the acting to the directing, and especially to the screenplay, this movie is spectacular!Russell Crowe turns in a fine performance.  Many of his critics who feel that he shouldn't have won an Oscar for his performance are taking it one step further and saying that he was downright dull.  I don't know if Crowe deserved the Best Actor Oscar, but I do know that dull he was anything but. He is the only one I know who could have played Maximus and given him any depth and at the same time be convincingly intimidating.  Kudos to the arguably best actor in showbiz!Joaquin Phoenix's work as Commodus was severely underrated.  It didn't take but one minute before I hated Commodus with a deep hatred.  His scenes with Lucilla (Connie Nelson) are just plain eerie, causing me to hate him more.

1677,weerab710,An Excelant Film,10,27 June 2002,"**SPOILERS**It saddens me to see so many uninformed and under-intelligent reviews for this film, which is unfortunatly the same for many other films on this site, ""Russel Crowe was pathetic"" is one comment,  this user must have been blind or concentrating too much on their popcorn to realise that this could not be more wrong. The comment on the box, ""Russel Crowe's performance hits the screen with such force that you can't rip your eyes away"" is far more closer to the truth, the film deserved very much the oscars that it received.Many would see this movie as old by now, but I am writing this today after watching it again and after all these years, it still has the same staying power that it had when I watched the first time.The movie is about a Roman general who has the utmost pride and loyalty to the Emporer, played by Richard Harris. Who has been betrayed by his son, Claudius, **Spoiler** who murders Richard Harris's character in order to circumvent his father's decision that Claudius will not be emporer after his father dies.  In order to succeed the throne against that wish. ** End Spoiler **There after, the General, ""Maximus"" played by Russel Crowe is also betrayed by the mentally disturbed Claudius, who murdered maximus's family because Maximus would not swear loyalty to Claudius as the New Emporer.
Maximus ends up as a slave to fight in the gladiator battles that Claudius has planned.Maximus now sets out to get revenge on Claudius and from there the plotline develops into a tangled web of good versus evil, in places it seems that the good will not prevail and in others you think that it might. Quite a twister!One thing I will say is that there is probably too much gore throughout the film, although this is balanced by the fact that games such as those actually happened in Roman times and probably were a lot more gruesome, something to think about....Anyway I think that there was no need for so much gore to get the plotline accross effectivley.The ending leaves no loose ends, which improves my opinion of the film considerably.Loose ends really annoy me at the end of films, some of the films that I had initially thought were good, end up with disappointing endings and many loose ends, which greatly reduce my final opinion of them.If I was to give an overall opinion of this film, I'd say that this is probably the best film I have seen to date, followed closely only by ""Titanic"", ""Lord Of The Rings"" and/or ""Men In Black""10 out of 10 See it if you havn't and watch it again if you have!

1679,pjcthepanda,The best epic ever,10,3 March 2007,"Having grown up watching historical epics like ""Ben-Hur"", ""Spartacus"" and ""El Cid"" it was wonderful to see this type of film making a comeback. The first film I watched on this scale was Cecil B Demille's ""The Ten Commandments"" starring Charlton Heston which even now still amazes me how they achieved those effects seeing as the film is now 50 years old.However, where the older films costumes seemed to be a little too clean, there was an element of realism in the look of this film. I cannot flaw any part of it. It has very strong performances from Russell Crowe (a well deserved Oscar winner), Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Djimon Hounsou as well as veteran actors Oliver Reed and Richard Harris. It was beautifully made and designed, accompanied by an excellent dramatic score which captured the elements perfectly. I thought it was a wonderful story which everyone can relate to about a man (Maximus, played by Russell Crowe) who just wants to go home to his family and his journey to get there ""a general who became a slave, a slave who became a gladiator, a gladiator who defied an emperor"". Despite the sadness of our hero dying at the end it was also happy as he had freed Rome from the dictatorship of rival Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix) and returned to his family in the after life. The look of the film was so real it made me believe that they had actually built models of Rome and had all those people in the Colosseum and all those soldiers were on the battlefield of Germania. I loved the fact they did not feel they needed to glamorise it just to put bottoms on seats unlike other epic films like ""Titanic"" and ""Pearl Harbour"" which had to put a love triangle in the movie which to me ruined the background events.In short, one of my favourite films and the best epic ever!",Gladiator

His death however wasn't tragic, in fact it was happy, as he ended with his reunion with his family.Gladiator was all about Maximus, a general in the roman army under Marcus Aurelius. Maximus braves yet another battle, in which he ends victorious. The emperor, proud of Maximus, offered him the position as emperor after he died. Maximus was to think on the offer. But Commodus, the son of the emperor, killed his father, and hence claimed the thrown of Rome. He ordered Maximus's death but the general escaped.

I thought the start was quite brutal and wondered since they started fighting in the first minute of the movie, then what else is there for the duration.

1686,ncfporter,Groan a minute,5,23 July 2001,"After finally getting to see this film, I wondered what all the fuss was about. By the end I was bored to death by the trite story and corny dialogue. The special effects are terrible (as bad as any film of the 1950s about ancient Rome), and it is only saved somewhat by the fact that the actors (if a little camp) seemed to believe that this was real life. And who chose the terrible music that burdened the film with meaning it did not possess? Has anyone noticed that when millions of dollars are spent on a film (Titanic, Pearl Harbor, Gladiator), very little of that is channelled into the dialogue? In the end the only thing that holds these films together are the actors (not all, but usually just enough of them).As my parents used to say, they don't make films like they used to. Well, they do still make good films, but only if there is a very strict budget.So, thumbs down.",Gladiator

1697,Stevelmarc,Powerful acting makes this an epic film,10,9 January 2016,"An impeccable film set in ancient Rome sends us on an emotional, adventurous, and entertaining journey. Maximus (Russell Crowe) leads the Roman legions to victory in their final battle against the Germanic tribes and longs for nothing more than seeing his wife and son back in Spain. Knowing Maximus owes him his loyalty, the Emperor audaciously over looks his son and rightful heir to the thrown and ask Maximus to succeed him. His son hearing about this plots for Maximus to be killed. Though Maximus escapes his assassin, he gets back to Spain only to find his wife and son murdered by the Emperor's son's orders leaving him devastated and broken. He is then sent into slavery to become a Gladiator and if that's not enough, he has to fight and entertain the very man who killed his family. Will he get his revenge? This is one of my favorite films of all time. It's absolutely worth your time.Spiritual Content: Many references to ""the gods."" Maximus talks about the ""Elysian Fields,"" a paradise of classical mythology. Maximus carries small statues to represent his family and ancestors and prays to them. The film several times shows Maximus imagining meeting his family in the afterlife, symbolized by going through a door into wide, green fields.Sexual Content: Nothing explicit. There is a barely hinted-at past between Maximus and Lucilla, and the film leaves open the question of whether Lucilla's son, Lucius, is Maximus' child. A gladiator master asks a man, ""What do you want, a girl? A boy?"" Commodus makes several incestuous advances against his sister, Lucilla.Violent Content: Frequent and extreme. The film opens with a headless Roman soldier on horseback and the Germanic leader taunting the Romans with the soldier's head. Opening battle scene shows men impaled by spears, pinned to trees by arrows, and frequent killing by sword. Gladiatorial combat features just about every possible way to kill a man short of nuclear weapons. To his credit, Director Scott does not dwell on gore; once the point is made that a man has been killed, the camera moves elsewhere. Still, the gruesome images burn deep.Crude or Profane Language: A woman is called a b--ch. One s-word.Drug and Alcohol Content: Little. Emperor drinks wine.Summary: Gladiator is a great film cinematically. The acting is powerful and the story is strong, even if it is a bit of a rehash of the Ben-Hur story—without the redemptive ending. Still, I left the theater feeling vaguely ill-at-ease, and it took me several hours to figure out why. I then realized that the degeneracy shown on screen—Emperor Commodus happily clapping his hands as a gladiator is decapitated, the crowd roaring its blood-lust—is too close to some forms of entertainment today, particularly professional wrestling. The gladiators of Rome took on certain contrived personalities, and gladiatorial combat was intended to tell some sort of story, just like today's equivalent of gladiatorial entertainment. And as the crowd's appetite was whetted by increasingly bizarre and violent combat, so too are today's wrestling maniacs. Gladiator serves as an object lesson as to what can happen to a society that proceeds down such a violent path. The extreme violence used to create that lesson, however, prohibits children and teens (and will dissuade many adults) from getting a chance to experience it.",Gladiator

1702,stancollins,"Better-than-average, and that's it.",6,11 February 2002,"Unlike many Hollywood blockbusters, the huge-budget special effects are justified.  The Colosseum scenes are truly visceral, and it took a giant budget to really bring them to life.However, there's nothing in this movie that will enrich or edify you in any way, and it doesn't stand up to repeated viewing the way a top notch film would.Utterly undeserving (in contrast to ""Spartacus"" and ""Ben Hur"", both of which having uplifting messages and strong acting to go along with Roman period pic fun) of Oscars, but not a complete waste time, especially if you see it on the big screen, where some of the imagery will linger with you.(Some small spoilers follow).I will cite this irony in Gladiator's defense:  Some of the 'cheesiest' parts of the film are also the closest to historically accurate.  For instance, Joachim Phoenix's performance will constantly remind you that he's an actor 'playing Commodus.'  The irony here is that by the best historical accounts, Phoenix nailed it;  Commodus *was* an actor, playing himself. (Also, he did enter the gladiatorial contests, and was a complete lunatic).The wistful longing for the Republic was probably passe by the time of the passing of Marcus Aurelius (known as the last of the ""Five Good Emperors""), but certainly something that had been a common sentiment in Rome for the first two centuries after Augustus (mostly due to the motley crew of idiots, lunatics and monsters who ruled immediately after him).",Gladiator
1703,crissov,Highly Overrated Popcorn Movie about Ancient Americanized Rome,3,22 April 2003,"Somehow many people seem to like this Roman empire set action drama flick. I'm definitely not one of them.It's a cheap, yet expensive, excuse of a story, already seen a thousand times (i.e. basically revenge), to cover the real reason for this movie: the fights. In this it is quite similar to 'Braveheart'. It falls far behind many, if not most, other films taking place in the same era, like 'Spartacus' or 'Ben Hur', although these included action scenes, too.The monetary success most likely originates from the same reasons that sports do--among them handsome people, villains/opponents, heroism, ""blood, sweat & tears"", and plenty of pathos. I honestly think this ultimately proves that today's people would visit real, bloody gladiator fights, if they were still allowed.I must confess that I didn't watch it on the big screen, so maybe I missed the full beauty of larger-than-life landscapes and deaths, after all it was pretty well done technically. It also was dubbed in German.",Gladiator
1704,Bonecrusher348,An Amazingly Different Action Movie,10,14 May 2002,"If you go into this movie expecting straight-up action packed scenes, a muscular hero, and the blood and gore that we've come to expect then you will get what you want, but soooo much more.  This movie has all a good action movie should have; a ton of fighting scenes with blood flying everywhere and a central hero who is unstoppable.  On top of that Gladiator is a story that highlights an ancient empire, both its glory and its corruption.  Russel Crowe is stunning as a humble, softspoken general who becomes a slave and fights, at first to keep his life, and later, to save an empire.  Russel Crowe is incredible as can also be seen in A Beautiful Mind and is one of the greatest actors of our day.  Crowe manages to play a gladiator who, although he fights for a living and does it amazingly well, also can be caring and humble. Joaquin Phoneix plays just his opposite and is also incredibly good.  In this movie you hate him so much because he is able to play a bad guy who you can't stand and want to see die a horrible death.  But that is what makes him so good.  He is ruthless and cunning, but is blind to his flaws and his hunger for power.  I think both of these actors are great in this film but Crowe takes the cake because he's the good guy and he's the one you're rooting for.  The scenery is also breathtaking as the filmmakers recreate ancient Rome including the palace and the Colesseum.  Of course since these places don't exist entirely anymore they were all computer generated but are blended in superbly and it looks like they're actually there.  This movie is definetly in my top 3 movies ever and perhaps I dare to say my number 1 ever.",Gladiator

Perhaps the best part of this film is the performance of Russel Crowe as Maximus, the lead character.  Crowe creates a heroic yet human character who demands both attention and respect.  Joaquin Phoenix is wonderful as the antagaonist, Commodus, and the rest of the roles fit in without err.  Gladiator is one of the greatest films ever made.  It entertains.  It thrills.

Joaquin Phoenix, is unbearable as a one dimensional, stereotyped, sniveling, overwrought, incestuous Roman villain. Russell Crowe's performance was fine, satisfactory--as usual, but certainly not particularly inspired or stalwart. He is one of Hollywood's most overrated actors.

Also the Emperor Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix, that part was well cast. But the two fine actors just cannot be reversed with the roles, can they? Of course not.The medium of movies requires tons of man-hours, equipment, then post-production, etc., all of this just to tell a story, entertain people for a very short time. Gladiator was that movie that utilized all available facilities and human potential to closely portray this tale of the Roman Empire circa 180 A.D. This movie really did not stray too far from reality as a lot of movies do, just for the entertainment value. We do know that the Coliseum existed, have historical accounts that closely resemble the living conditions and daily life of the people of 180 A.D.Gladiator has a moral center in which the main characters never waved from even when it could be expected to do so under such conditions.Maximus drove everything he had to accomplish what he did, against the insurmountable odds, and that makes a great story.",Gladiator

I wouldn't say anything else, but still this is a movie, and a great one as well perhaps one of the best i've ever seen. You say its not historical right or the plot sucks or something like that, but you've got to face the fact that if this is supposed to be a movie it cant be 100% historical accurate (don't get me wrong i love history especially around this era) because that means the movie would be much longer and not as nail biting exciting as it is now. Lets take ""Conn Iggulden"" as an example, he has wrote some of the best books i've ever read (historical novels) but still they aren't 100% true to what really happened, because then the readers would'not have been grasped by it the way they are now (i don't say i wouldn't cause i would but everyone wouldn't have). And therefore you can complain about this and that perhaps with good reasons but you got to get over it cause the fact is that it is a great movie ""YES A MOVIE"" and truth is that there are those who are much worse (The Last Legion for example), so try to enjoy the movie aside from historical errors which will always appear and accept it (to a certain degree) So enjoy this fantastic movie and love it :) Vennlig hilsen Simen",Gladiator

So what? Does every film that is based on a period of the past need to be historically accurate? Ie. Shawshank Redemption, L.A. Confidential, The Mummy, Saving Private Ryan, 300, Inglorious Basterds etc. The answer is simple - NO! It's called creative license and it's been used by authors/script-writers for countless years.If you wish to watch something that has been extensively researched and is historically accurate then find yourself a nice documentary!

Never thought Mr.Scott could surpass 'Blade Runner' or 'Alien' but I think this movie has everything and some!! I just cannot say enough about this film except believe the hype - I've just watched the extended blu-ray version (all but 3 hours) and its as good now as the first time I watched it. Every actor in this film puts in a stellar performance - as well as Crowe there is Joaquin Phoenix as the much reviled Commodus, the amazing Richard Harris as an all but too brief Marcus Aurilius, Dijimon Hounsou as the slave Juba and other great performances from the likes of Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Thomas Arana amongst others.

I believe that what made this film amazing was a combination of the incredible acting, directing, scriptwriting and the incredible soundtrack. The fight scenes in this film are some of the best I have seen, there is one specific scene that I have in mind. If you have seen Gladiator, I am sure you will know which one I am talking about.Gladiator is one of my favorite films of all time and it will remain that way.

1716,BlueCorsair,"Everything you could want, and more...",10,12 March 2003,"(some spoilers, not many)Some people lament this films not-completely-accurate interpretation of ancient history, citing that though a good deal *is* accurate, other parts are not. Others deem this film unworthy due to the fact that it was too ""Hollywood"".While both are valid points, I don't believe them to be at all damaging to what should be the central part of every great movie - not the cinematography, not the score, nor even the acting - but the story. A good story tells itself, as all of us should know, and a good story can overcome any other limitations.Gladiator does just that.Reminiscent at times of Spartacus, at others of the infamous ""I, Claudius"" series, Gladiator does a good job of introducing people (many who probably have only cursory knowledge of anything prior to when they were born unfortunately) to ancient times, with obvious emphasis on Rome.The depictions of the Roman senate are correct. All of the soldier's equipment is also accurate, as are the tactics employed in the opening battle sequence. Yes, yes, yes - there was no such thing as a ""thumbs up"" at the true Gladitorial games, but there have to be some sacrifices to relate to the non-historically inclined.Ultimately however, the story is what truly shines. And I'd say it's as non-Hollywood as they come in some essential ways. First of all, our hero and protagonist, Maximus, is not your typical hero, bursting with bravado and dropping one-liners like some bronze-age Swarzenegger. He is a capable man, thrust into a role he wants no part of. Right from the beginning, it is established that all he truly wants is to return home to his family, and nothing more. He dreams neither of glory, nor wealth, but peace after many years of war.The terrible tragedy that befalls him is not of his own doing - he is a politically naiive man, defamed and stripped of rank by politicians, an entity he cannot comprehend. Embittered by the betrayal of the nation that he fought so hard to protect and expand, Maximus is a sullen, resigned character, who only shows brief spurts of contentment throughout the rest of the film - and after what happened to him and his family, he has every reason to feel this way.Ultimately, as may (or may not) be a surprise, in VERY much anti-Hollywood fashion, our hero dies at the end. After all he has accomplished, all he suffered, he still dies anyway. This made me quite sad actually, but enhanced the emotional pull of the picture ten fold. As an almost unwritten rule, the hero does not die. Sure, he may get beaten, stabbed, shot up, and sworn at, but in the end, he still lives, gets the girl, and life goes on...None of that happened here, and so we were fortunate to bear witness to one of the few great cinematic moments of the last decade.9.5/10On a purely ""guy"" note - wonderful combat. Enough blood and hacking and slashing to keep me properly entertained :0)",Gladiator
1717,h-p-lassche,History or entertainment?,3,27 February 2004,"Either you want to make a movie which is true to the facts (as we know them) or you just want to make a big screen spectacle, not bothering too much about the details. This movie is neither. Considering all the ""realistic"" scenes and scenery, it wants to be a depiction of true historical facts, but it is not! So for people who know a little bit about Roman history it is hard to take the story very seriously, but, on the other hand, because the makers seem to take it very seriously, it is hard to watch it as simple entertainment.To name only a few examples. Which Roman general would ever leave his troops in the middle of a (political) conflict? His army is his power basis. Of course, had Maximus done the most sensible thing and called his army for help, then Commodus would have been wiped out and the movie would have been over within 15 minutes. But no, Maximus runs, away from his army.Second example. In the end, when Maximus returns to Rome as a famous gladiator, he is recognized by people who remember him as general Maximus. Remember, when he became a gladiator, it wasn't as general Maximus, but as an anonymous. Is he released....? No, but only because the story dictates that we should wait for the climax, not for any logical reason.The coincidence that Maximus, fleeing from Germany to Spain on foot, which would have taken a few months at least, finds his house still smoking is just too much.So maybe the old Hollywood epic historical movies didn't look so realistic (actors were clean and had white teeth), but Errol Flynn and Douglas Fairbanks were so much more fun to look at, because they didn't take it all too seriously.",Gladiator

I mean every time I see this movie I cry at the end, because of the great score composed by Hans Zimmer. This movie was a breakout roll for Russell Crowe who in my opinion is an underrated actor. Also Ridley Scott redeems himself as one the best directors in Hollywood with this epic. So if you want to see a great movie with great action scenes and a superb story line to go along with it, than this is your movie.",Gladiator
1720,mcpkone,This script is the best in a long time!,10,13 September 2003,The movie is great. Most of all I appreciate how many layers one can peel from this movie.

1721,Happy__Camper,"The singing,dancing Hollywood extravaganza goes back to Rome.",5,25 January 2004,"I was absolutely shocked by the rating this movie got here and elsewhere, I thought it was a poorly written, pseudo-histroric dribble.<Some spoilers ahead>First-off, the story. I'm pretty sure it's been ripped-off from ""Fall of the Roman Empire"", removing all original parts from it and replacing them with various ""gritty"" decapitation and disenbowling incidents. The characters are fac-similies of any cheesy action blockbuster role: the vengeful general-turned-gladiator, the power-mad emperor and the grieving orphaned-widow only searching for a little tenderness, c'mon!! The story evolution itself is lacking: the people of Rome are ready to rebel just because they like some gladiator's fighting-style, and the praetorian guard who kill Maximus' family and allies suddenly turn to help him on a whim. Any attempt for character studiy is abruptly interrupted by more gore-tastic antics.Now the acting. Let me say that this is not one of Crowe's good acting days. I loved him in the ""Insider"" and a ""Beautiful Mind"", but here, he is wooden and amateurish: they say the indicator of a bad actor is his ""angry scenes"", well Crowe's look-at-the-ground-tense-my-biceps-ball-my-fists-and-growl routine (the very same from L.A Confidential, just different costumes) is definitely an indicator. Joaquin Phoenix, an amazing actor normally, is bogged down in his horrible, horrible, role. Even Richard Harris's and Oliver Reed's stellar performances aren't enough to save this picture.Finally, the history. First-off, Commodus wasn't a power-hungry arrivist, he was a retarded, fornicating party-boy who had to be dragged to the throne. Secondly, all historians agree that Marcus-Aurelius died of natural causes. The historic details are so badly done that some latin shop signs have spelling errors (it's not my opinion, I read it in a film magazine).It seems Ridley Scott is about to join the hallowed mass of directors with great technique but no regard to content.",Gladiator
1722,bat10001,Destined to be a classic,10,3 September 2004,"Gladiator is an underrated movie to say the least. It should be on the top 10, and in my book it's at position 1. People tend to think it's bad because it's not 100% historically accurate. Guess what, it's not a documentary, it shouldn't be judged as one.The dialogue is strong and the story is the one we all love, and it plays out without flaw in Gladiator. The movie sets a new standard for the definition of epic. If you watch Spartacus or Ben-Hur after Gladiator, you notice how plain and un-epic those movies are in comparison. All the actors performed flawlessly, especially Joaquin Phoenix (should have won an Oscar) and Connie Nielsen, I love the ""Am I not merciful"" scene, so much emotion with so few words. No single actor could be replaced to make this a better movie, it was a perfect cast.The musical score is magnificent, it's so in sync with the action and the emotions on the screen, and so majestically epic, it's in itself destined to become a classic. Too bad Hans Zimmer was robbed of the Oscar.The scenery is phenomenal, the landscapes are perfect, the CGI is top notch. You can FEEL the grandness of Rome. Splendid use of light and color in every single scene. I especially like the scene where Commodus and Maximus are elevated on to the arena, protected by a tortus formation of praetorian guards.Are you not entertained? ARE you not entertained? YES, yes we ARE. Maximus, Maximus, Maximus, Maximus...10/10 - A classic.",Gladiator
1723,mirelesjuan78,Good film!,7,6 August 2017,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world.

However, one of the most refreshing aspects of the film was that, as an Englishman,it eased my movie paranoia. A major epic, internationally successful- and the villain's played by AN American! And the hero isn't! And most of the ""Good guys"" are played by Brits! If recent Hollywood epics (E.G ""Braveheart"",""The Patriot"", the one where the bloody boat sinks) are anything to go by, we English are all sadistic, devious, perverted Nazis! (Actually, the whole ""need a villain, get in a Brit"" thing goes a long way back- George Sanders as Shere Khan, Basil Rathbone and Alan Rickman as Sherrifs of Nottingham ) And if ""Private Ryan"" and ""U571"" are anything to go by, we just curled over and downright surrendered to Hitler without a squeak! (Mind you- does anyone remember Errol Flynn in ""Mission Burma""?- plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose, as the French sometimes say, when they're not too busy collaborating with Germans (That's a joke, by the way).

I can pretty much, hands down guarantee that a large majority of people would also enjoy this film and feel the same about it as it do. The best element of the film was the raw passion that the gladiator (Russell Crowe) shows throughout the movie and i also found his passion quite motivating, he constantly gets put down in his story and it seems as if he will never have any luck and i loved they way he kept getting back up and fighting with a new renowned spirit. must watch!",Gladiator
1727,dinnghelhaile1999,My review,10,5 December 2013,"Gladiator is an amazing movie with a lot to messages in it .... it is said to be the way people in Rome had to suffer just for their freedom .The thing about this movie is that the empire had killed his own father, just because he wanted the whole Rome to see how people need to live life not by luxury but by pain , sadness , regrets that are to come later in life . But there is still love between the slaves especially the ones who had a family left behind and never going to come for the rescue at all .... But still one gladiator changed all the rules in Rome right from the moment he won the fight till death he knew the world he had grown in .... needed a great change and he did it well and made his point to his wife and children that had been taken from him .I would want to change the world if I could in their time .... but the modern world is much better ... a lot better ....

Such viewers would be perfect public at the Colisseum where the final struggle takes place. The movie is a rather poor remake of ""Fall of the Roman Empire"", a movie which was not memorable but which had some point to it, for it showed the way in which the Northern blonde people were shamelessly butchered which provoked the reaction which was to seal the fate of Rome. That movie had a more elaborate story and showed how a system can go wrong. There is a worrying trend in these epic remakes such as Gladiator, The Passion of the Christ and to a much lesser extent Troy (Troy is actually quite a good movie) for gratuitous violence and no real message, no real humanity or depth. It seems we have regressed to Roman times. It is almost like we have become blood thirsty and unchristian.",Gladiator

1731,agalbraith-633-379277,Pure Brilliance,10,16 December 2013,"""Gladiator"" is a classic contemporary piece of Hollywood Production. It sees Russell Crowe as Maximus a general within the Roman Army betrayed and framed by the Emperor's corrupt son and exiled as a result. However, he becomes a gladiator to seek his revenge, and to ensure justice will prevail.It captures every emotion possible in only the way an expert director can achieve. Ridley Scott direction allows for more believable characters. You will be truly moved by Maximus' resilience and determination. Russell Crowe's portrayal as Maximus was Oscar worthy and truly rousing. The sets are very impressive too taking into detail a feudalistic and ancient Rome; with breath-taking scenery, magnificent structure of buildings and arenas. Ridley Scott also makes his directorial impact known by embracing both beautiful acted scenes and glorious bloody battles. The epic battles touch on both violence and emotion to keep the viewer engrossed by the action. The screenplay is also excellent which captures the true emotions of the film. Although some view the film as being historically inaccurate I feel the film captures the time period superbly and with only the odd historical inaccuracy.Gladiator is a true master piece and gives the likes of epic films such as Spartacus and Ben Hur a run for their money. In both cinematic effects, epic plot and excellent acting.",Gladiator

1733,linje-nilsen,Magic!,10,8 January 2005,"I loved Gladiator. It's moving and makes you really feel absorbed by the Roman world, as director Scott aims. It doesn't matter if many historical details are not right. Scott depicts the period as an excellent painter and the screenplay is full of beautiful sentences that remain impressed in your memory. Russell Crowe is absolutely gorgeous in the virile role of Maximus, the general/peasant/family-man who becomes a hero not only because he is an excellent soldier and leader, but mainly because of his humanity and his solidity (strength and honor! ), his principles and his moral values. Leader/manager roles suite Russell Crowe best. His voice impresses: he can roar like the tigers he fights against in the arena, but he is also able to whisper love words in the sweetest way. He definitely deserved the Oscar for this movie, certainly also for other movies like A Beautiful Mind, but especially for playing Maximus. The plot may be simple, but the study of the characters' minds and the historical period are what really matters in this movie. The actors' performance is splendid. The unrelenting, massive fight scenes can be appreciated also by a woman when they are breathtaking and are depicted like that. Gladiator made me think of certain characters in Shakespeare's plays, who live as if they were caught in the ""wheel of history"".",Gladiator
1734,chris_j_albanese,A shamelessly bad film *SPOILERS*,2,14 December 2004,"Gladiator has little to teach us about the past. In fact, it has little to teach us about anything save what not to do if you're trying to make a thoughtful film of artistic merit. The beginning has some promise. We are presented with the main character, a general named Maximus, who has seen battle for untold years and desires to resume his humble life as a farmer with his wife and daughter. If it weren't for his unshakable sense of blind civic duty he would have done this long ago. We see Marcus Aurelius, the old, passive emperor known for his stoicism. The movie does not paint him as the relatively aggressive imperialist he actually was, and perhaps we wonder why it doesn't, until we realize that the movie is following a simple rule: all characters must be one-dimensional. Our first impression is the correct one. There is no more than meets the eye; these people are either good or bad. For example: Maximus is good. Anyone trying to kill him, e.g. other gladiators, a.k.a. people who have probably been forced into exactly the same uncomfortable position as him, is bad. It's that simple. Gladiator does have an attention to certain historical details. The costumes, including the armor, for example, that the soldiers (Maximus included) at the beginning of the film are wearing is likely what Romans of the time would have been wearing. This is a departure from previous Roman epics, which tend to use the brass breast plate with the muscles etched into it for Roman soldiers regardless of the time period. So, score one for Gladiator, right? Maybe. But who cares, when we consider the absurd battle that follows? It quickly breaks down to a chaotic melee, with a lot of slashing, that looks completely uncalculated and un-Roman. The Romans win it easily anyway, but if they had actually fought like this they would never have been the consistent victors that they were. They had a method, and they used it, and it definitely wasn't 'every man for himself!' Another perfect example of the film simplifying history comes when Marcus Aurelius says that he wants Maximus to succeed him, so Commodus, Aurelius' son, murders him before he can tell anyone else. In actuality, the succession of the throne to Commodus was not in doubt. The film wanted to make it clear, however, that Aurelius is good, Maximus is good, and Commodus is bad.To examine the character Maximus in detail, we ought to look at his deeds. In the eyes of the filmmakers, he is without flaw. But look how he behaves!He spends the film ruthlessly seeking revenge on Commodus for the murders of his wife and daughter, and eventually his revenge is satisfied. There are no negative consequences for his brutal, murderous revenge. In fact, he gets exactly what he wants: on one hand Rome is handed back to the senate and thus becomes a republic again as Aurelius wished (and what Aurelius wants, Maximus wants because of his sense of duty). On the other hand, he is reunited with his family in death. The movie never tires of telling us that this is his ultimate goal, and then has the nerve to show it literally instead of knowing that it is understood! Remember the moment when Maximus is first handed a sword at the gladiator training camp. He throws it down in protest, either because he refuses to obey his captors or because he is opposed to gladiatorial combat (or both). Roughly two minutes later, though, he is in the arena fighting, though his life never appears to be in immediate danger, because he is so much stronger than his opponents, and such a superior strategist and swordsman; it seems more likely that he enjoys the killing. The movie refuses to acknowledge this completely, because Maximus is the hero, and a necessary condition of being the hero in this movie is flawlessness. Consider also the people he is killing. They are just like him, probably abducted or born into slavery against their will, and forced to fight, yet somehow the movie pretends that they are evil or inhuman. It masks them and makes them out to be the aggressor. At one point Maximus spares a man's life against Commodus' thumbs-down (which should have been a thumbs-up, but that's merely a historical point), but he isn't being merciful out of compassion. As a matter of fact, he is not being merciful at all! All he is doing is showing that he and he alone has complete control over whether a man lives or dies. It is sadistic.The contemporary relevance of Gladiator that I was able to uncover is its warped political perspective. Its sentiments are republican, in the Roman sense of the word, and in the sense of the Republican Party in America today. It values things like civic duty, being a manly man, a family man, a strong man, someone who isn't afraid to kill to defendwhatever. It views liberalism as controlling, preventing Maximus from living the humble farm life that he might enjoy in the state of Montana or thereabouts. It opposes sexual irregularity, and seemingly with it homosexuality. If it were aware of stem-cell research, we could guess that it would oppose it. Essentially, its year 2000 release was the perfect kickoff to eight years of hilarity with the Bush gang. A better way to be contemporarily relevant is to make a thoughtful film that asks deep questions about human nature, or the best way to govern people, or something like that, instead of flaunting some obviously hypocritical moral code.",Gladiator

The plot was unique in its concept. It had action to keep men involved and the love and sensitive family issues for the women. Although, not totally historically accurate (i.e. purple everywhere instead of red) I felt the setting was overall great. It made you feel like you were actually seeing the Roman Empire.The character of MAximus is a strong one. He is also very human like in his emotions and decisions.

1737,paul-lowe69,Possibly my favourite movie of all time.,10,24 January 2005,"There are thousands of reviews about this film. Some critics love it, others do not. Some are indifferent.So what can be said about it that has not been said before? Not a lot really. But what I can say is that any film that can create so many opinions and discussions has got to be worth watching to find out what all the fuss is about.People will talk about the performances of the actors, the dialogue, the cinematography and hundreds of other in-depth subjects. But for the laymen such as myself, what do you get from this movie? Well firstly, the movie excites you with the action of the battles, then angers you with injustice of the new emperor. Then you feel the pain of our hero and his despair at the futility of his new existence. Then you are brought back with him as he once again takes control. The power, the invincibility. You feel euphoric as you sense that revenge is near...but then.... Every emotion you can think of is summoned in this movie. A cliché I know, but it is a roller coaster!! Crowe will always have his critics, but, if this movie is re-made a thousand times, no-one will do it quite like Russel.",Gladiator
1738,soph-94,An almost perfect movie,8,23 October 2013,"This is the story of a roman general, Maximus, who displeases his new emperor, Commodus, because he was too close to the old emperor, Commodus's father, and is sure that Commodus killed his father, which he did. So Commodus has Maximus's family killed and Maximus ends up becoming a gladiator, having to fight for his life in the arena.I really liked this movie, even though I first saw it when I was a kid and there are some pretty violent or nasty scenes, like for example when Maximus finds his wife and daughter burned and hanged in front of his house. It's full of action, and you want to know how it's going to go, if he's going to survive and if he's going to stay a slave forever.I recommend to see it, because it's beautifully played and the settings and clothes seem authentic. If I had to give the negative aspects, though, it would be that you have to have time to watch it, since it is a long movie (that is if you watch the extended version, which is obviously better and more complete). Also, if you never saw it and already saw Pirates of the Caribbean, you will be thrown off by the music. Yes, it is the same. It's not plagiarism though, both soundtracks are by Hans Zimmer. You would have the same effect while watching Lord of the Rings if you saw Braveheart, so it's not that uncommon a fact, even though in that case the movies were NOT scored by the same artist.One last thing though, if you know a lot about roman history and want to watch 'Gladiator' to see how much of the movie sticks to real events, don't. It is a great movie if you are not easily upset with inaccurate facts. For example, Commodus did not actually killed Marcus Aurelius to take his place, they reigned together for many years before Marcus died.So in general I really loved it, except for these 'minor' details, and I think it's one of those movies which everyone should have seen before ever saying they have a good cinematographic culture.",Gladiator

I personally felt that it was unfair that Joaquin didn't get an Oscar for this performance while Crowe got it. I felt that Joaquin performed as good if not better than Crowe and it was his character that made the movie more interesting. The only problem I saw with this movie was that the plot has been stretched to 150 minutes while it could have been fitted into 125-130 minutes.

But, he was weak, and really only wanted to love, and be loved. I loved the fighting scenes, so realistic. Cicero was another one of my favorite characters. Always faithful to Maximus to the very end. He set things in motion for Maximus, when he contacted Lucilla. She paid him and thanked him. I think she loved Maximus, but it was not clear that they could actually be together, if he lived. Which brings me to the only part of the movie i would've changed.

One big disappointment was the language. Before i watched this movie, i watched Narcos with its authentic Spanish, Braveheart with this awesome Scottish Accent and Inglourious Basterds with Brad Pitt and his cool Tennessee Accent. I don't want to say that the whole movie should have been in Latin, but this American English destroyed the whole atmosphere.

Russell Crowe is embodying the Roman general Maximus Decimus Meridius like he was born for this role. While watching the movie, you can feel the striking and courageous personality of the Spaniard, like they call him in the movie. Joaquin Phoenix was the most perfect antagonist they could've taken for. His underhand and egoistic character made the spectator hating him as the role of Commodus - thats why he was nominated as best actor in a supporting role at 2001 Oscars. When a Roman general is betrayed and his family murdered by an emperor's corrupt son, he comes to Rome as a gladiator to seek revenge.

1758,Russell_,Can't be missed!,10,12 September 2005,"""Gladiator"" definitely is a classic film as it combines a simple, but moving, story with beautiful scenery, filming, direction and score  it is truly a ""complete"" movie.I am mostly compelled with the beautiful script which in a way reminds me of poetry, though it is still everyday language. I love the acting portrayed by the late Oliver Reed and also Richard Harris. Russell Crowe, Djimon Housou and Joaquin Phoenix are also superb and the parts suit them perfectly. There are also a number of less ""popular"" artists who also deserve a big ""bravo"". Amongst them I have to mention ex-Mr Universe Ralph Moeller who is mostly used as the comic relief of the movie. In Gladiator we can also the beautiful and popular Maltese TV Star and actress Ruth Frendo, who although has a small part, she is totally brilliant and outstanding.Actually I got to IMDb while I was looking for her name on the internet, in fact on IMDb she has some very stunning photos. I was lucky to meet Ruth Frendo whilst she was filming in another Maltese production. Ruth Frendo is not only a gorgeous and talented actress but she is also amazingly intelligent and very down-to-earth. We will definitely be seeing more of her work in the future... The scenery used for ""Gladiator"" is brilliant  and the opening battle scene is definitely one of my top favorite scenes. The modern camera technique contrasts sharply to the brutality of the gladiators actions and blood shed during the movie; and I love the light contrasts thanks to the lenses which most definitely have been used to create a surreal feel to the entire movie.""Gladiator"" deserves all the awards and great reviews it has received, and for those of you who still haven't gone and watched it  I can assure you that it will be well worth your time and money.

Who thinks this drippy wailing schmaltz is a suitable accompaniment for any worthy action?Not me, anyhow.One of the very nice things about Gladiator is that Oliver Reed gets a decent part, suited to his skills, and that he acts it with admirable restraint.

I find the most common complaint is that the story is too simple and basic, but there's nothing wrong with that. Sure it's always great to see movies subvert genre conventions, but if there was any movie that did the basic tale of revenge to such an epic level, it was Gladiator.The characters are iconic, supported by powerful performances. Crowe's Oscar for best actor is well deserved and I will always remember Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus, the action scenes are intense and spectacular, the visuals are astonishing and the music is breathtaking, creating an overall epic and emotional experience like no other.Not only is this my favourite Ridley Scott movie, but it's simply one of my favourite movies of all time. If you haven't yet, watch Gladiator.",Gladiator
1770,ViswamberPrasad,"General Maximus,will forever rest in our memories",9,11 October 2019,"You,should have already,seen the film by now,so I'm not going to take the liberty of narrating it again.Ridley scott,is something,more than a director.He is more of an artist,I suppose,For,Gladiator,is his breathtaking masterpiece.Everything from the screenplay,to the music is on point,the casting is lit,the way they have showed the Roman Empire,the garden,the Colosseum,even the slave camps,are enchanting and mesmerising.(sounds very cliché?)
Russel Crowe.This guy,killed it!.
Right from the point when he whooped the arse of the German tribe,to the killing of Commodus,he keeps us glued to the screen.He makes us sympathise for Maximus,and rise with him,as he ascends to become Rome's Hero.When the entire Colosseum,chants ""Maximus!"",one finds it difficult,to control his excitement(I found it difficult.I was honestly jumping and cheering on the inside,but as none of that matters,LET'S MOVE ON!).
Joaquin,nailed the way he portrayed Commodus.He makes us grit our teeth,upon the mere sight of this dirty minded tyrant.Commodus,is an immature,wrong doing/thinking pig,who envies the fame of Maximus and has feelings for his sister.Basically,an unworthy ruler.I especially,loved the scenes,leading to the climax.Right from,when Maximus and Lucilla have a sweet tête-à-tête,in the Gladiator's resting camp,the movie really shifts its gear.We are then shown that Maximus is captured,and then moving forward a few scenes,BAM!the climax,one of the best,in the history of Cinema.When Maximus,avenges his family's death,by killing that twisted swine,Commodus,and imagines himself,meeting his wife and his son,the film transcends from a mere form of art that eats up 3 hours of our day,to something abstract,that leaves an indelible mark on the viewers.The film,depicts,many problems,that still exist in our world and evokes a feeling of satisfaction upon its completion.The film,like most of Scott's films,(especially those like Kingdom Of Heaven,Martian,Robin Hood),caters to the liking of all the film goers.
I speak for myself,when I say,Gladiator,is something,more than just a film.Gladiator,shall split the timeline of Historical epics,as Before Gladiator and After Gladiator.

There are some faults with this film - some parts of it do drag - but somehow it is completely compelling, and you can forgive them.

The aerial views of the ancient city and Coliseum, complete with crowds, are truly dazzling.Russell Crowe is most impressive as ""the general who becomes a slave who becomes a gladiator who defies an emperor."" Emperor Commodus is suitably smarmy - you want to reach up to the screen and whack him yourself!
A bit slow at times, but who cares? The visuals are breathtaking and the combat scenes are unequalled in any movie.

Well, that's not completely true: the movie is a perfect example of action director Ridley Scott (Crison Tide, Alien).So I went back for the second time to find out what it was.Firstly the visuals are great, but the created atmosphere (especially the battle sequence in the beginning) throughout the whole film is exquisitely darkish.Secondly Russell Crowe plays Maximus as Steve McQueen did in his Heydays. It was a pleasure to see someone play the anti-hero in McQueen/Eastwood style. Supporting roles by great veterans like Richard Harris and Oliver Reed (the film is dedicated to him, having passed away last year after a drinking contest on Malta) make the cast and acting performances complete for me. Joaquin Phoenix, While a great actor-to-be, wants to star a little bit to much for my likeing, however he presents a villain devlish seldom seen on the white screen.Thirdly, having a major part in accomplishing that, the music contributes in a great way to the whole ambiance. Hans Zimmer outdid himself and Lisa Gerard Is mysteriously enchanting.I found he story itself is good, with a few unexpected plot twists. But it isn't great either.That's my two cents.",Gladiator

Pheonix did one of the worst acting jobs of the year, though what could he do when the script couldn't decide if we should hate him because he's a coward, because he's cruel, or because he's a pervert.  The three reasons didn't mix well at all.  I do have to say the fight scenes were great, with the exception of the direction in the first one and the blade on the wheel cutting someone in half.

1785,staylor,An Excellent Aspiration Reasonably Achieved,9,5 May 2000,"Gladiator, set in ancient Rome is as fine a Roman Epic as I've seen.  The opening combat sequence is glorious for it's use of speeded up photography, perfectly capturing the mind numbing intensity such a battle experience must have been!  And the implements of war you see on the screen are worth the price of admission alone.  By it's end I felt I'd fought in the battle personally.Russell Crowe is superb as Maximus, and to my estimation played a better epic hero than Charlton Heston ever did.  Joaquin Phoenix's portrayal of the Emperor Commodus is somewhat lacking in range, but, I am not sure whether it is his fault, or the fault of the script.  I tend to suspect the script, because I enjoyed his performance overall.Connie Nielsen ruled the screen as Lucilla, a part demanding incredible moments of subtlety, which the lady accomplished with aplomb.  Oliver Reed, to our enormous good fortune, left us one last character, leaving out no detail with his wide range of skills.There are drawbacks, but talking about those reveals the heart of the movie.

The same can be said about Richard Harris, Derek Jacobi and Oliver Reed, the best actors of that film, but working with an auto-pilot) and a very weak soundtrack could win all those Oscars or even nominated for them? Furthermore, a film that isn't able to win the oscars for the script, the editing, cinematography, actors (besides Crowe, i've already told my opinion about that), director, music and soundtrack (these are really the oscars that award a film and make it good or bad) awarded with best film of the year?i think that everyone who knows anything about films understands my position. I don't consider Gladiator as one of the best films for 2000 (a rather weak year for films, by the way), i consider it as one of the greatest disappointments of the year.

But this film is a triumph, regardless.  It's not for nothing that comparisons between the vision of Rome given here and Hitler/Speer's new Berlin are drawn; even the music is inspired by Wagner. This is an epic allegory, of sorts. It's about much, much more than the spilling of blood for the entertainment of the masses; it's about the culture that asks for such amusements, and the possible responses to that brutality.

These set pieces were very ""in your face"" and left me feeling a bit stunned from the combined audio / visual effect - it made me think that the film might almost be better watched on the small screen.Russell Crowe was good as the hero, but I thought the best actor was Oliver Reed, who played a slave owner.Overall, the film is worth a look, but I can't rave about it as I have seen others do.",Gladiator

That seems to be rather popular way of standing out from the standard Hollywood fare these days, but if not careful it can look contrived.Yes, it's formulaic Hollywood on some level, but Gladiator won me over despite that.

I'm sorry to have to point this out but it really doesn't take that much talent to make what is an essentially predictable and some what dull film with a spattering of nice effects on a film that only seemed to have a budget of epic proportions!

One would think that a Hollywood movie would not be able to capture such qualities on film, sacrificing realism for the fluff, sex scenes, gratuitous violence and stilted weak plots.Ridley Scott doesn't make that kind of movie.  He brings to the screen a very realistic seeming portrayal of life as a Gladiator in the Roman Empire. Russell Crowe gave one of the most amazing performances of his career, bringing the title character to life, and managing to make Maximus real in just a few short hours.Definitely a movie to see.

I had no idea what was going on during the battles most of the time and thus found myself getting more and more bored. The film definitely looked great, but the battle scenes were a bore because of the extreme closeups and quick cuts after quick cuts. Weren't the battles the main attraction?

1798,ajcarr,This got an Oscar?,3,29 August 2004,"I missed this on first release, but have watched it on DVD. To be quite honest, it's tripe of the first order. The script is awful, and the acting generally not much better (thank heavens for the computer-generated actors: they are at least the equal of their flesh-and-blood rivals). I found this film to be deeply contrived and boring. As for the garbage of the Emperor Commodus fighting 'mano a mano' with a gladiator, the scriptwriters must have been on something stronger than LSD.Presumably Ridley Scott hired Derek Jacobi for 'Gladiator' because he'd played a Roman before (to whit, Claudius, see below), but even in his minor role he out-acts the far starrier names (except for the late Oliver Reed, who steals every scene he's in).If you want a _real_ flavour of 'life at the top' in the Roman Empire, get the DVDs or videotapes of 'I, Claudius', the BBC's conflation of Robert Graves's 'I, Claudius' and 'Claudius the God'. This is far better written and it's superbly acted. It's also more convincing, despite being made on a shoestring budget. If 'I' Claudius' is an excellent fillet steak in a superb restaurant, accompanied by the finest wine, then 'Gladiator' is a gristly hamburger in a seedy fast-food joint, washed down with a 3rd-rate clone cola.",Gladiator

1800,Ulkesh-3,A Masterpiece,10,30 May 2000,"Gladiator is a wonderful, epic film. Definitely the best I have seen in a long time. It is entertaining and though provoking. Scott's direction is spot on, the casts performances deserve a standing ovation and the score is wonderful. Combine this with the breathtaking CGI Rome and you have a winner!",Gladiator
1801,asc8,Incredible.....a must see.,10,27 April 2000,"As a huge fan of Braveheart, I must admit my skepticism before I saw the sneak preview of Gladiator tonight.  I was expecting a derivative action/adventure flick; decent, but not spectacular.  What I got was an amazing film...an epic of Braveheart proportions, not a cheap rip-off as I had expected.  Needless to say, my feelings going into the movie were dead wrong...it was terrific.  Russel Crowe was a strong and believable hero, and he has certainly become one of today's premier leading men. The casting and costumes were superb, and the story was simple yet powerful.  I don't want to give anything away, as the movie has not yet been released in theaters, but I will say that  this is a must see for any movie fan.  Though it was a bit long (2 and a half hours), the story kept moving, and there was plenty of action and laughs to keep the audience interested. The theater was packed for the sneak preview, and everyone left talking about how great the movie was. My vote is a 10 out of 10.....this one is extremely entertaining...GO SEE IT!!!",Gladiator
1802,Anakin-42,The epic adventure we've been waiting for!,10,28 May 2000,"Gladiator takes you back to the days of the Roman empire and gives a perspective of what life in 180 a.d. might be like. Not since the days of Ben Hur or Spartacus have we had a movie like this. It tells the story of Maximus, the saluted Roman general who becomes a slave and a gladiator after Commodus, the sinister son of the old emperor Marcus Aurelius, through patricide takes over the position of emperor and slays the general's wife and son, destroying his life. Maximus swears revenge and fights his way to the mighty stage of the Colloseum in Rome, where he squares off with his foe.I saw this movie at the premiere in a theater with over 600 seats, a screen reaching 65 feet from side to side, and the most brutal THX sound system this side of the known universe. The place was packed to the brim with people, dying to see this movie. From the beginning to the end, two and a half hours later, this movie delivers on all levels! Everyone in the audience started to applaud when the movie was over, something I haven't experienced since the premiere of Episode I, as they, just like me, were in utter awe of what they had just seen.From the acting to the photography, from the music to the realistic brutal violence, this movie never failed. It's a master piece deserving both a second and a third viewing at the cinema, and a definite pre-order when it hits DVD. Ridley Scott hasn't made anything this good since Blade Runner and Alien.I can't recommend this movie enough. You simply have to go see this picture now!",Gladiator
1803,Hunter-61,Russell Crowe shines as a Roman Mad Max...,8,19 May 2000,"Despite the initial revenge by the numbers feel of the first half of the film, Crowe carries this film magnificently in his slide from hero to abject despair and redemption of a sort.On first watch, there are many similarities with the first Mad Max film - hero doing his bit for ""society"", wife and kid at home.  His family is killed by the bad guy and the remainder of the story is a rollicking ride to see how the revenge is pursued and ultimately obtained.Being an American film where the good guy has to win, that he will get his revenge is without doubt, only the path matters.Phoenix's character is almost a caricature of a bad guy, with no redeeming features whatsoever; the byplay with the Senate mostly lost in the story.Ultimately a satisfying story - the sweeping opening battle designed to either solidify Crowe's character's battle mastery and general status, or to self-justify the cost of staging the battle.Enjoy..",Gladiator
1804,JohnH-8,"For a 2.5 hour show, it could have been longer. Great entertainment.",10,1 June 2000,"Right from the start, this film strikes you as special with a scene that, if it is meant as an intro, looks like the finale of most other films. The special effects, although hugely impressive, do not take over the story which is simplistic but powerful. How Roman life was at that time is about as graphically illustrated as you would like to see but in more than a violent manner. The roles, and particularly the actors, especially Russell Crowe, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed, enrich the film to their credit. Altogether, miss this one on the big screen, and you'll never really see it again.",Gladiator
1805,Irene-17,Rome revisited!,9,6 June 2000,"Ridley Scott, te saluto! This film was so much better than I expected when I'd seen the trailer, the old city of Roma Aeterna so much better done and the Germans so much more true to the possible truth than in most films! (I still wonder what the German in the beginning says...anyone who knows?) Sure, this is an action movie, but with enough heart and soul to keep you tight in your chair for almost 3 hours, which is more than you can say of most films... Of course, the film is not following the true story (Commodus was, as they say, strangled by a certain Narcissus), but that isn't so important when the film grabs you like this does. So: one complaint: why put in the birds? They're animated and you see it! Why???",Gladiator
1806,brayfield,See this in the theatre,10,7 May 2000,"See this one in the theatre. I haven't seen an audience react so collectively to a movie in a I don't know how long. Gladiator is the stirring story of Maximus and his fight against the Roman emperor. The previews hardly give justice to the bone crushing, decapitating, roaring battle scenes. The cinematography is almost perfect, transporting one to the wilds of Germania and bowels of the coliseum equally well. I know it's early but I wouldn't be surprised to see an Oscar or two come out of this movieRussel Crowe's carries this movie well. If were to compare this to Braveheart I would say Gladiator has Braveheart beat hands down. If you like a good old-fashioned action flick, definitely see Gladiator.",Gladiator
1807,Computey,A must-see movie,10,28 April 2000,"I have never written a review before but thought that it would be nice since I saw a sneak preview of this movie last Tuesday... This movie was spectacular. I thought it would be very boring and I only went because we got free tickets to it. The story is about Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general with the Roman forces. He knows the Caesar, Marcus Aurellius, and Marcus Aurellius wants him to take over when he dies. When Marcus Aurellius tells his son Commodus about this, he gets really mad and kills his father. No one knows that Marcus Aurellius wanted Maximus to take over, so Commodus does and proceeds to try to execute Maximus. He sent out men to kill him, but didn't realize he wasn't slain. He also killed Maximus's family. Maximus is found and becomes a slave. All he can think of, though, is how to get revenge on Commodus. This movie is brilliantly acted and gets 9 stars by me. The beginning of this movie is a war against barbarians and is not too graphic. I would have rated it PG-13 if it wasn't for the small amounts of gore. All in all, see this movie!",Gladiator
1808,PontNeuf,Is this an authentic Scott at all???,1,25 September 2000,"Even if «Gladiator» weren't as weak and banal as it is on it's own right, the fact that it was supposedly done by the very same man who created «Blade Runner» and «Alien» would be enough to damn it in all eternity.What an unbelievable loss of filmic quality! What a shamefully predictable plot! What quaint dialogues! What - even that! - poor videogamey visuals! All right: there's patricide, there's revenge, there's lotsa blood. There's even almost incest. But all oh so underscored and looked at in such awe and abomination that it can only be there to  cater for a bourgeois (or adolescent, for that matter) need of a thrill, quickly followed by the reestablishment of order. Nothing more. No discussion, no actual leap into the dark. Nothing really unsettling, for the gods will eventually see to it.Not worth one of Sigourney Weaver's gasps or of Harrison Ford's broken nails.Whatever's the matter with Ridley Scott?? «Alien» shaped all our nightmares afterwards and the future was never the same after «Blade runner». And then, «Gladiator»... There's this very popular phenomenon of director's senility (just take a look at Coppola's «Jack» or Antonioni's «Jenseits der Wolken» for the sake of illustration). But then, R.S. isn't THAT old yet, is he...? Can't really fathom it.Due to a very strange paradox, I doubt «Glads»  would ever attract as much attention as it did, were it not done by the great author of «Alien» and «Blade Runner». Whoever would have enjoyed it anyway would enjoy it and forget it. More reasonable people wouldn't be seen dead in the theatre, not even gagged and handcuffed. For one thing, -I-  would definitely not be wasting my time writing about it. But, again, justice must take its course.",Gladiator
1809,Biffcool,UFC with a bad plot,5,15 May 2000,"Gladiator was ultimately a bunch of alright fight sequences ruined by mixing it with the most trite and overused plot devices from every kings court political movie ever made.

1811,sloth-14,A window on the past,9,4 May 2000,"For the first time ever we have seen what it was really like to be among the Roman army as they do battle.  The opening scenes of Gladiator are jaw-dropping, as we witness not the clean and  clinical Roman war machine that history describes, but a rough, dirty and brutal killing force. Russell Crowe is perfect as Maximus (among his other names - The Spaniard, The General, or just plain Gladiator).  Great performances too from the rest of the cast. The fight scenes are excellent, the gladiator costumes are brilliant. Ridley Scott has done it again, this film should do well at the next oscars. Hail Maximus!",Gladiator

1813,tony.sanelli,Brilliant epic,9,17 April 2000,"I saw an advance screening of Gladiator and was for the most part blown away.  Russel Crowe's versatility radiates in this picture, compared with The Insider.  He is the ulitmate Roman hero, vanquished by political enemies.  His challenge will not only be to survive his predicament, but to restore the values, hopes and dreams of a forlorn nation torn by greed, economics, and evil.The cinematography is awesome- Kurosawa-esque in it's grandeur, magnatude, and graceful treatment of the action.  There are many smaller hand to hand encounters that are also exciting.The true power of this film lies in the brilliant performances of Crowe as a magnetic hero, and Joaquin Phoenix as the tortured heir of the Roman kindgom.",Gladiator
1814,Rudiger-3,Disappoint Much? Contans Spoilers,1,15 May 2000,"I thought that overall the movie wasn't very good. I did think Russell Crowe was pretty good, but the rest of the cast was unimpressive. I disagree with some readers that the movie was action filled. The action was short and was frequently dispersed with lengthy talking/dramatic scenes that tried to add to the intrigue and tension but failed. It seemed to me that the movie originally had some scenes that would have helped the flow and were cut out or something. Also, some of the characters were so inconsistent for example, Quintus, (Maximus' second in command [I think]) was his friend in one scene, betraying him in the next, and helped him in the end...what was that? Also, on the battle at the start...they really messed it up. I don't want to sound like a dork but ROMANS DIDN'T USE FIRE ARROWS or any arrows at all for that matter. The Roman army was composed almost entirely infantry. They only used bows when they had cheap auxiliary troops from a territory or something. Remember the spears the infantry had? The thin metal ones? THAT is what they would have used, you see, they THREW those if they had used those spears in hand to hand, they would've gotten wasted hardcore. A weird thing about that is, the cavalry had swords only, now tell me the sense of fighting from horseback with a Roman short sword. They would've used lances. A final argument to that scene is, they wouldn't have brought and set up those siege weapons for an infantry fight. They simply took too long to set up and fired too slowly to be useful. One the other hand, it was kind of cool to see and I thought the production values, as far as the armor and mass amounts of troops were cool. They were entertaining, but they weren't very well researched. Another thing that bothered me was I felt the camera actions throughout the movie kinda spoiled it.  The camera was jerky and the speed of it was constantly altered ad nauseum They should've taken some hints from other epic war movies and movies with that sort of action.My final thought is, the movie could've been a lot better, but it's worth watching once. Also, there is NO WAY it equals Braveheart in ANY respect.",Gladiator
1815,gregatory,"A nail biting, intense modern epic!",10,3 May 2000,"Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotisitcal persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this collosal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS!",Gladiator
1816,bolbazz,Historical Euphemism par excellence,1,30 May 2000,"Watching this movie has caused me to once again wonder, how a director can manage to create images of perfect beauty, while producing such a horrible plot and dialogues that almost make me blush for just hearing them at the same time. I thought the 90s had finally brought movies with such appalling heroic pathos to an end. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Not only does Ridley Scott make usually excellent actors bring forth lines that let ""The Phantom Menace"" ring like Shakespeare in my ears. He also shows no scruples whatsoever twisting history around entirely and making the Roman Empire look like a benevolent pacifier. All in all, if it weren't for a few corrupt Senators and a megalomaniac young emperor, Rome seems to have had no flaws for Scott whatsoever. Ah, a little genocide here, some imperialism there...the others were all ""barbarians"" anyway. The only thing that really surprised me was that Russell Crowe was not draped by a flag at the end...oh, wait, that movie was about Rome, not about America, wasn't it? My mistake!",Gladiator
1817,rbernier,I love this movie,10,23 May 2000,"The first thing I want to say is I love this movie. It is only the second movie I've seen starring Russell Crowe, and in the words of my buddy and fellow movie critic, Robert G. Cash, ""I think I'm in love with Russell Crowe."" Similar to his character, Bud White in L.A. Confidential, Crowe is soft spoken, hard as nails, and outstanding as the principled and intrepid General Maximus Decimus Meridias.Maximus is favored by the dying Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), to take over as the keeper of Rome upon the Emperor's death, and is given the charge to destroy the corruption rampant in Roman society, turn the government back over to the Senate and end the rule of the Caesar's forever. The Emperor's jealous and power hungry son, Commodus, played very well by Joaquin Phoenix, is distraught when he hears of his father's intentions and sets out to destroy Maximus and everything near and dear to the General. (By the way, Commodus is the Latin word for commode. No wonder nobody likes this guy.) Commodus orders the General's death, but is startled when Maximus shows up later in the Colosseum of Rome as a slave and a gladiator, determined to exact revenge on the new Emperor ""in this life or the next.""Richard Harris, always one of my favorites, gives a great though short performance as the aging and good hearted Marcus Aurelius Caesar. Connie Nielsen with her classical look is perfect as Commodus' sister Lucilla, forced to keep her unstable brother happy while at the same time aiding her former beau Maximus. It is good to see Oliver Reed again as the slave trader and gladiator trainer Proximo, and even though Reed died part way through the making of this film and they had to digitize some of his scenes, he is still a better actor dead than the entire cast of (we demand more money than we deserve) ""Friends"".The battle and fight scenes remind me of Mel Gibson's Braveheart in their realism and brutality of sword combat, however, the scenes seem more surreal than Braveheart and the ""cut aways"" are often too quick to really see what is happening.Finally, just my two cents when it comes to movies about ancient Rome in general. Why are there never any Italians? Is Rome not in Italy? Did they not talk like Al Pacino in those days or what?",Gladiator

It is a return to more than 40 years of film history - when they used to make epics like Ben Hur, Spartacus and Quo Vadis. The actors are excellent especially Russell Crowe and Oliver Reed (who died during the filming stages in Malta). The opening battle scene is simply stunning and the gladiatorial fights in the colosseum left me grasping for breath.

Then I thought to myself that this movie posses a quality that Braveheart does not.  It possesses the quality that you get satisfaction at the end of the movie.  In Braveheart you do not get satisfaction at the end and it is difficult to watch many times.  I believe that that is the reason why Braveheart didn't do as well as Gladiator did in the box office but did win 5 Oscars.  This movie is a work of art.  The score complements the movie so well. Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer deliver the movie in music notes rather than words. Russell Crowe is great in the movie and reminds me alot of Richard Burton. He is an up and coming star who is destined 2 win an Oscar.  Joaquin Phoenix also delivers a great performance worthy of an Oscar.  The late Oliver Reed is outstanding.  Reed seems to steal the scene that he is in from all the other actors because of his acting power.  Ridley Scott delivers a classic film that will remain in our memory and our hearts.

1827,smalrus,The movie rocked the collisseum,10,1 July 2000,"Drawing the line between martyrdom and heroism is what makes Ridley Scott's Roman epic, Gladiator, such a powerful and moving movie.  Using some computer generated shots as well as a cast of extremely talented actors, Scott beautifully creates a fictional story that shows the start of Rome's eventual downfall.  I don't know too much about the history of Rome, but I didn't need to in order to enjoy this five star movie.  Despite all the action and bloodshed, the humanistic issues are what bring this movie above any Hollywood anti-hype it would otherwise get.There wasn't much to this movie that I didn't like.  Graphically, there were some great matte scenes of the city and the bird's-eye view of the opening battles added to the war-like feel of the movie (however this scene reminded me a little too much of the Gungans- Droids scene in Phantom Menace).  All the gladiator battle sequences were great- brilliantly choreographed and superb in cinematography.  The shots were rapid fire, not allowing the viewer to focus on any one image for an extensive amount of time, but slowing down before the victory.  Thus, the movie felt like it was more action packed, albeit bloody.  The themes of the movie, ""Strength and Honor,"" were always in my mind and reinforced the concept of the tragic heroism of Maximus.  Maximus wouldn't be a martyr, nor would Commodus have him that way, so the element of tragic heroism overshadows the movie. Because of this feeling and the intense acting that Russell Crowe puts into his character, the closing scene was extremely moving, almost bringing tears to my eyes.  Adding to the emotion is excellent scoring by Klaus Badelt, Lisa Gerrard, and Hans Zimmer.  The classical music gives movement to the slow scenes as well as the fast paced battles, yet doesn't detract from the story itself.  Maximus deals with human issues such as death, honesty and trust, and loyalty to a cause he believed in.  Gladiator was probably one of the best movies I've seen in a while and although it is rather gory with several heads getting sliced off and a lot of bloodshed, the movie as a whole comes through as something that is definitely worthwhile seeing.  It probably wouldn't surprise me if some Oscar nominations are given to this movie, either to Crowe or Phoenix, but that won't be for another year. Definitely a must-see movie.",Gladiator

1831,wideawakedreamer,Today I saw a movie become more powerful . . .,10,4 June 2000,"The movie is the story of Maximus (Crowe), a general who leads the Roman army to victory over Germania in the beginning of the movie. The dying emperor of Rome, Marcus Aurelius, is watching this battle.The emperor's son, Commodus, then arrives with his sister Lucilla, and it is discovered that Commodus fully expects to be announced the new emperor of Rome in a few days. Aurelius, however, has other plans--he wants to make Maximus emperor, and requests that of the general, who wants nothing more than to go home to his family.I went into this movie having just watched Ben-Hur in my film studies class and having watched an episode of Xena only a couple of weeks earlier that featured the story of Marc Anthony and Cleopatra. So you could say I was in the perfect mindset to watch a ""sword-and-sandal"" movie. I wasn't sure what to expect, having somehow avoided all the hype that accompanied this movie. But I was not disappointed.Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. (This movie is not for the squeamish, that's for sure.) There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast.  The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Excellent.The script was being written and re-written as the filming was going on, yet it doesn't show that the actors had no idea how the movie was going to end when they began filming.  The acting is terrific. Russell Crowe is wonderfully cast as Maximus. Many reviewers agree that he is now officially a star. Joaquin Phoenix also proves his mettle as the emotionally troubled Commodus, whose behavior and emotion toward his sister could give anyone the creeps. Connie Nielsen makes you believe that, as Lucilla, she really is torn between natural loyalty to her brother and doing what she knows is right. Oliver Reed, in his last performance, is memorable in his role of Proximo, the former gladiator who is the owner of Maximus and brings him to Rome.  In short, the actors were brilliant in their roles, not over-acting, but giving subtle, strong performances.The script itself is very good.  Although some elements are a little hard to believe--the fact that no one recognizes Maximus when he's a slave?--this film calls for a willing suspension of disbelief, which one would happily comply with.  (It's really no fun to nitpick such a movie.)It's true that this movie does pretty much follow the Braveheart formula. However, this movie includes some elements, such as the cinematography and the incredibly graphic battle scenes (one reviewer likened it to Saving Private Ryan, ""only better""), that are spectacular in itself. Overall, a great movie that I highly recommend.",Gladiator

The first battle was very realistic as to what would have happened. The sheer destructive power of pre-gunpowdered weapons was almost beyond belief. And all this in the first ten minutes of the movie.There are those who would not like this movie because of the violence in it. My reply would be, ""How can you do a movie about a gladiator without violence"". The violence was not the main feature of this film. It was about the will to survive, and about revenge.Overall, if you want to see a movie that grips you from the start and gives you an insight as to the political maneuverings in the Roman empire in the second century, this is definitely the movie to see.",Gladiator

The movie is long, but it never gets boring, and the action scenes are really well done. The story is similar to those of the classics such as Ben-Hur or Quo Vadis but hey, everybody expected that.Anyway enough talk, go and watch it because it´s destined to become a classic, if it´s not already.10/10",Gladiator

I loved the scenery, the story, the fight scenes, every thing was great about it from start to finish. But I can't say on thing about the movie that I felt was memorable or outstanding. I know that sounds strange but I can't. I know this is one that I will own on DVD and I will see this one again and I do recommend you seeing this film.

1837,Obi Nick,Visually Stunning Thrill Ride,8,6 May 2000,"If you're looking for a visceral movie you've found it here. 'Gladiator' is a visually stunning thrill ride from beginning to end. Punctuated by a brilliant Russel Crowe performance, a fabulous blend of styles from the bombastic Hans Zimmer ('Crimson Tide') and the melodious Lisa Gerrard (Dead Can Dance) in the music department and the stunningly beautiful visual effects views of mighty Rome, this movie is a real treat. While some story elements are a little weak and some battle scenes may not be for the faint of stomach this movie is nonetheless a fun take on the classic Hollywood-epic a la 'Spartacus.'",Gladiator

Bravo Ridley Scott.",Gladiator

Historical elements, stunning scenery and brilliant casting are the reason why this movie deserves to be compared with these other great movies, even though the story of the movie is not as authentic as the others. Russell Crowe is fantastic - he has the same presence on the screen as Mel Gibson. Connie Nielsen and Joaquin Phoenix also deserves credit for their performances.

1841,lofwyr-3,"Exciting entertainment, but not much more",6,29 May 2000,"The first thing I want to say is that the film was far better than I expected. The fighting scenes were good, the acting too, and the special effects were just amazing... I was really impressed how the film showed the ancient Rome , a great work of the special effect crew.But the story was just the same old thing. Bad man cheats good man and becomes king (in this case: emperor) , and good man fights for justice against the bad man although he's inferior. Well, you can also find that in Shakespeare's pieces, so this is certainly nothing new. And because the characters were all in all clichees, this is not shown very good either. Another point: the film is, historically seen, not correct: Rome never became a republic again, and Commodus reigned until 191 AD. And he was certainly not killed in the arena... The last point: Maximus is quite a stupid name, it just means ""the greatest"", and romans didn't name their children like that... well, these are all just unimportant details... 6/10",Gladiator

This movie, gives us again the tremendous fun and the enjoyment of movies like «BEN HUR», «QUO VADIS». Of course the special effects are the main difference, but the suspence, and the action are fantastic. The story, the actors, the spectacular fighting scenes, the special effects...(in two words) all the production are tremendous glorious and they give us again the glory of the peplum genre. Congratulations. This movie is one of the most spectacular movies i ever seen. It is a great movie.",Gladiator
1843,brikeri,too much hype,7,5 May 2000,"Although I thought that the movie was good, it was too long and there was way too much hype surrounding its release. It did not live up to my expectations.  Russell Crowe is superb.  The supporting cast was weak. Story line dragged.",Gladiator
1844,Darth Lorenz,The most epic movie for years,9,5 June 2000,"Gladiator by Ridley Scott is easily the biggest and most dramatic movie since...oh, heck, it´s just GREAT. The story is straightforward and simple, but (as some folks wrongly thought) that´s nothing to complain about. The best stories are the most simple ones, and this one is about classic elements like friendship, betrayal and revenge. Granted, it´s a men´s movie. So if you don´t like it go see the new Julia Roberts comedy.The Acting is just terrific. Crowe, who already was great in ""L.A. Confidential"" and ""Virtuosity"" is going to get an Oscar or i´ll never again enter a movie theatre. Phoenix is also terrific as his Nemesis who has some very human weaknesses. The supporting cast is also very good. It´s also nice to see Ridley Scott back in town.The CGI Graphics are not always convincing; they look too artificial. Most impressive, however, are the battle scenes (did I hear someone say ""Braveheart""? As another guy here pointed out, the battle scenes in ""Braveheart"" looked like a picnic, compared to ""Gladiator"". Nothing to add here.). The fight against the guy with the face mask, surrounded by tigers, is just breathtaking.""Gladiator"" is simply the best movie for some years (if you don´t count ""Star Wars"", which is beyond and above competition).Go see it!",Gladiator
1845,talkingwall-3,"Great visuals, plot contrived",7,15 June 2000,"When I saw gladiator, I couldn't help juxtaposing it with Braveheart: Very similar story lines and both movies try to be epic in scope (not to mention that people compare the two australian stars, russell crowe and mel gibson).  I enjoyed Gladiator's breath-taking visuals and its WWII style battle scenes and even its occasional gore, but i walked away from the movie thinking that it was lacking something.  Gladiator lacked qualities that made braveheart a true epic.  Perhaps i speak too harshly of gladiator because i compare it to Braveheart, but i thought that braveheart was immensely more powerful.  Gladiator's Maximus, though suave, spent too much of early screen time not wanting to be involved (then later being forced into action) whereas Wallace from braveheart is shown as a child to build history and align the audience's sight and sympathy with the soon-to-be older wallace.  Beyond little petty things such as that, Braveheart is more more grand in scope than gladiator.  Braveheart dealt with the issue a nation of people who were struggling againt tyranny and the passion of one man, further powered by the fury of his slain bride, to free his country. Gladiator shows corruption within one system of government and one man who is quite indifferent about it.  Only later... way later does Gladiator push its protagonist into limelight to shake up the scene; but with what motivation?  Only that to avenge his lost family (something that braveheart used as its auxillary motivation) and to kill the corrupter of Rome. Sorry Maximus, but Rome became corrupt anyway. Talk about phyrric victories.",Gladiator
1846,The_Sock_Fairy,Very good.,10,24 June 2000,"This movie was great. The costumes were awesome (especially Maximus's fur general uniform, and his helmet when he was a gladiator). The story was really action-packed, suspenseful, surprising, and a little emotional. The special effects with the gore was awesome. I didn't even notice that the movie was a little longer than others, it's so good you wish it would never end. It has a great plot, and you really feel there along with the characters. I totally recommend it, 2 thumbs up!",Gladiator
1847,mercanti.1,Best Movie in a Long Time,10,23 May 2000,"I find it extremely hard to believe that many critics voted this movie below an 8/10. ""Gladiator"" carried more presence, more power, and more energy onto the screen than any other movie in many years. All cinematic elements came together - the casting, the story, the setting, the costume, the score - everything.Russel Crowe's inspiring portrayal of the noble general Maximus brought faith back into the art of film-making. Maximus was played with such conviction that it was very difficult to remember that this was just a movie. What made Maximus so captivating was not his aggressive role as a fighter, but his loyalty to his family and his genuine care for the goodness of Rome. Crowe brought to life the very human qualities that all people wish to achieve: honor, courage, valor, respect.Crowe's on-screen nemesis, Joaquin Phoenix, also played his role as Commodus with an innate passion. Commodus was ingeniously portrayed as the evil, immoral emperor - the man for whom Maximus is to seek vengeance upon.The other cast members, Connie Nielson as the emperor's sister Lucilla, Oliver Reed as the ex-gladiator turned entertainer Proximo, and Richard Harris as the all-powerful Marcus Aurelius , were all outstanding in bringing to life the emotions of this time period.None of these actors could have achieved such on-screen genius without such an awe-inspiring and intriguing story. It has been a very long time since this genre has entered movie theaters, and ""Gladiator"" sure brought that history to life. One was only spell-bound to the experiences and events that the people of that era lived through. It is about time that a movie came along that shared this important piece of history with modern society, so that people today realize and appreciate the goodness of our current society.The spectacular landscapes and sets also adds to the beauty and realism of the film. The background and Coliseum scenes were put on screen with such precision. The costumes were also appropriate to this time period. The score was also an element which added to the drama and powerful impact of the film.Walking out of the theater I was nothing less than completely satisfied. My faith in movies was completely renewed with this movie. Gladiator stretches beyond the role of a conventional popcorn movie, for it is something that leaves the viewer with a new sense of inspiration and a new understanding of a monumental era in our history. Maximus' role also goes beyond the call of duty since it provides us with a new sense of how life should really be lived: with honor and courage.",Gladiator
1848,flowerchild,This movie was awesome!,10,17 June 2000,"I absolutely loved this film.  I have seen it three times and would see it again in a minute.  It was much better than Titanic (I would love to see Russell Crowe battle Leonardo DiCaprio...boy, would that be funny!)  A lot of people complained that the storyline was familiar and simple.  Well, most epics are similar..and why does one need complicated storylines all the time??  I thought it was refreshing to see a character that was truly good, without hidden agenda's or alterior motives. All of the acting was wonderful, but I have to especially mention Russell Crowe.  I first saw him in L.A. Confidental (which he deserved an oscar for) and have seen most of his movies.  Whether or not they were good (like Virtuosity or Rough Magic) he did a wonderful job.  I think the thing that amazed me the most about his performance was the way he could show so much emotion without talking--through his eyes.  It made me want to cry, seeing the emotions that man expressed.  I have to also mention the acting of Joaquin Phoenix...I couldn't decide whether I despised or pitied him more. Making the audience hate him really demonstrates his acting abilities, imo. The special effects, music, and acting combine to be one of the greatest epics of the past three decades....a must see.10/10",Gladiator
1849,shane6,"Ridley Scott, we salute you!",10,2 June 2000,"I had been waiting several months, trembling with anticipation, for the arrival of this film, and I am pleased to say that it did not disappoint me. Russell Crowe is instantly likeable as the world weary General Maximus, commanding the legions about to ""unleash Hell"" on the armies of Germania. His only aim is to see an end to battle, and return home to his farm and family. Certain events, heralded by the intervention of Joaquin Pheonix as the insane emperor Commodus, spectacularly prevent him from doing so. Commodus is a power mad, snivelling wretch who, when he isn't plotting and scheming to rule Rome, tries his hardest to get his sister into bed. The unfortunate Maximus gets in the way of his plans, and so has to be removed. Maximus winds up in the gladiatorial ring facing a madness far removed from that of the battlefield. He now has a different criteria. To survive the arena and exact revenge on Commodus for the brutal slaying of his wife and son. The battle sequences are bloody, violent and messy, and human life is cheap. But through all of this shines Maximus, a noble but reluctant hero, who touches the life of all those he comes in contact with.The excellent score by Hans Zimmer is powerful and emotional, borrowing some of the choral strains from his Crimson Tide offering, and Holst's Mars theme from the Planets suite. (He was the Roman God of war, after all.) The soundtrack hasn't left my car stereo since I bought it two weeks ago. Reading through other reviews, it seems that people either love or hate this film. I loved it with a passion; something about it touched a nerve. Some scenes left me breathless, while others had me fighting back a tear. I have seen it four times now, and it won't be the last. There are a lot of purists out there who say that Rome was never like this, and that history records these events differently. To these people I say, WHO CARES?! I go to the cinema to be entertained, not watch a documentary. I go to escape from the real world for a few hours, lose myself in fantasy. Surely this was the reason that Cinema was invented.I cannot stop praising this film, much to the dismay of my friends and family. Gladiator should be in receipt of a few statuettes come Oscar time, or there is very little justice in this world. Ridley Scott has, in my humble opinion, produced a masterpiece worthy of praise. We salute you!",Gladiator
1850,elaport,Entertaining with minor reservations,6,31 May 2000,"I was entertained, but then I could watch Russell Crowe read the phone book. LA Times review mentioned trite dialogue in script.  I think it is a testament to the actors that none of the dialogue came off that way to me. In lesser actors then Crowe or Phoenix, the dialogue would have been awkward and full of bricks.  Script/story are full of holes but does that really matter here?  My main pet peeve was the undercranking and variable speeds in Cinematography during the battle scenes. Why?  Does it train our eyes to accept the intense digital matwork when we get to Rome?  I don't know.  It kind of got in the way of the storytelling in the battle scenes for my taste.",Gladiator
1851,delfene,Superb in all departments. Russell Crowe you're a star!,10,1 May 2000,"Believe all the hype,the film IS amazing in all aspects. The battle scenes (particularly the one fought in Germania) is one of the greatest EVER filmed.The gladiator arena scenes are bloody, brutal yet extremely well choreographed.Crowe shows why he should be instantly propelled onto the A List of leading men. His performance as the vengeful underdog/hero General Maximus is the perfect blend of strength, humanity and courage.Laurels aplenty also for the underrated (but not for long) Joaquin Phoenix who plays the villainous,troubled and love-starved Commodus, the beautiful Connie Nielsen and a fitting film finale for the late Oliver Reed (one of his greatest performances.)The SFX featuring old Rome are just SPECTACULAR.The towering Colosseum filled with spectators is just breathtaking, particularly when the camera does the 360 degree pan.A fine film making feat for Mr. Ridley Scott. Hail Ridley Scott!Hail Gladiator!",Gladiator
1852,teenratboy,One of the best movies of the year !!!,10,8 May 2000,"I went to see this for no reason. I was bored and just got up and made it my choice to see this. I am EXTREMELY happy that I saw this. The movie is by far THE best movie that I have seen this year. Do NOT, I repeat DO NOT let the marketing fool you into thinking this is just some hack em'/slash em' movie. The Marketing for Fight Club, Three Kings, and The Iron Giant killed those movies. Don't let the same happen to this instant classic. The movie itself is beautifully shot, almost as if any one shot could be placed above a mantle. The acting is done perfectly, although most of the credit goes to Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix performed greatly with what little material he had to work with. Last, but not least, some people might complain about how the battle scenes are too hard to understand. The point of the battles were not to entertain, but rather to show how a real battle is like. Your friend and mine, this is Teenratboy signing off.",Gladiator
1853,GeminAi,"Great acting, but the rest?",7,6 May 2000,"Russell Crowe is fantastic as Maximus in both physique and temperament.  As a man of honor who valued the simple things but who could back them up with his sword, Maximus is a character worth sitting nearly three hours in a theatre for, and Crowe brings Maximus to life in ways that makes me wonder if Russell is ""acting"" at all.  Connie Nielson is also well cast as Lucilla. A real beauty, (think Sharon Stone), her scenes with Maximus are first rate. The other cast members did a good job as well.  I would point out the boy who played Lucius only to say that he is a far better child actor than the one who played Anakin Skywalker in The Phantom Menace.  As for Joaquin Phoenix, I wanted him to be more ""psycho,"" in that while he succeeded in making Commodus disturbing, I found myself laughing at him more than I was scared of him.  There were times when I simply wanted to tell Commodus to go to his room, and I would've done it without fear of reprisals, but I'm not sure if that's Phoenix's fault so much as it's the script's.The costumes are wonderful!!!  Especially Lucilla's outfits, and her jewelry and makeup are perfect as well.  The battle gear and gore make-up are also well done.Visual effects-wise, the inside of the Colosseum is great, but the rest of Rome seems so fake.  While breathtaking, it is obviously computer generated. As for the battle/action scenes, they seem rushed and choppy.  The opening scene for example, both visually and audially (esp. the arrows) reminds me of Star Wars for some reason, but I digress.  The first half of the battle is well done, showing the sheer numbers on both sides and the strategic planning involved.  However, the second half is annoying in the way in which it's shot.  It doesn't live up to any of the Braveheart battle scenes that people seem to want to compare them to at all.  The rest of the action scenes seem to follow the same pattern--great general set-up, horrible follow through.  The lighting however was well done in terms of when and how it was used to fit the theme of the movie.While obviously leaning on the action scenes with its epic proportions and gory grandeur to draw in and ""entertain"" the movie-going audience, the movie would have been better off focusing on the more intimate and human interest side of the story.  The best scenes in the movie were the ones that took place out of the sight of ""glorious"" Rome with its architectural wonders, its mob-like masses, and its moral corruption.  Those shot in dark, dank corners between two or three people, esp. those between Maximus and Lucilla, were fantastic and did more to draw me into the lives of the characters, where the real story should take place, than any that dealt with the fate of Rome.The Gladiator is still a movie that I would recommend to others however, if only to make sure that Russell Crowe and Connie Nielson get the recognition that they deserve.  But don't take my word for it, go see it for yourself.",Gladiator
1854,marquise-2,"A real ""attention-catcher"" !",10,29 May 2000,"For me, a ""long"" movie (3h) during which your mind never wanders away from the screen is to be considered real good. This one for me is a real ""attention catcher"" because it has a good story, great decors and sceneries, beautiful photography, great attention to details in recreating ancient Rome, and great staging of the battle and the combats. At times you don't know to which part of the screen to look at !Excellent cast but with, I believe, a particularly great performance by Joaquin Phoenix who proves to be very talented.  I loved it... and went to see it a second time in order to better grasp all the details.",Gladiator
1855,Johan-76,Great action/conspiracy movie,10,6 May 2000,"The movie displays brilliantly the power and weakness of the Roman Empire. From victories on the battle field due to technical superiority and superior battle strategies, to the immoral actions taken by the Rulers of the Empire, to strengthen their own position of in the government. But the movie is much more then battle scenes and politicians fighting each other; it also give the viewer an insight into the different facets of love  from the ideal platonic love, to the sick desire of a brother to lie with his sister. To wrap all of this up, we have great computer graphics to really display the might of the Roman Empire. Great Movie  A `MUST SEE'!!!!!!!",Gladiator

Commodus, his son, knowing the plans of his father kills Marcus Aurelius. Maximus, promised to power see his family assassinated, becomes a  gladiator, after being prisoner sold as a slave. In Rome with his triumphs in the arena of the Colosseum, the circus maximus,he defies the power of the tyrant Commodus. In the real history Commodus takes power with 15 years and has not killed his father; he loved the circus spectacle and even participated in it.Is this film a metaphor of modern relations of power- the mob, the media- inside the present dominant empire?",Gladiator
1857,Bill-629,BEST MOVIE I'V EVER SEEN!,10,2 August 2000,I loved everything about this movie. Russell Crowe and Joaquin Pheonix both deserve Oscars for best actor and best supporting actor. The music was excellent and so were the sound effects. The CGI effects were unbelievable. The un-sung hero of this film is Oliver Reed as Antonias Proximo. He gave a great final performance before he died. This film definitely deserves at least a nomination for this year's Best Picture!,Gladiator
1858,shamem,"A pretty good flick, but with some glaring errors :(",6,7 May 2000,"Ok, I saw Gladiator last night, and on the whole I was impressed. The acting was good and there were some interesting in-jokes. However, historically it left much to be desired.First, the good parts: Marcus Aurelius' Meditations reveal that he did not much care for the public life, and longed to return to his quiet life on the farm back in the country. Sound familiar? Also, there had been a revolt by a senator named Cassius shortly before Aurelius' death, and he shows up in the movie, yay! I also liked the fight scenes, yes that makes me no better than the mob, but I thought it was interesting how the actual killings tended to be displayed either sped up or slowed down, in either case making them seem unreal. In regard to the mish-mash of accents, I thought it added charm to the movie, after all, Rome was a mish-mash of people, no?** There are some spoilers in the following section. You have been warned **As far as the history goes, I have heard some complaints from friends about Aurelius actually being in Germania (he did go out on the road with his armies) and Commodus entering the gladiatorial ring (which he also did). My major issue is the fact that Commodus enjoyed(?) a 12 year reign! He was not, repeat not, killed in the Coliseum by anyone, he was drugged and murdered the night before he was to accept a consulship. (Dressed as a gladiator, no less) For me, that brought this movie down a couple notches. Historical license is one thing, but killing emporers less than 6 months into their reign is too much for me.Final analysis: 6/10",Gladiator
1859,Michelle D.M.,A Truly Captivating Experience.,10,9 May 2000,"Gladiator left me absolutely speechless, it is one of the finest films since the reminiscent days of Ben Hur and Spartacus.  The opening sequence of this epic, featured a realistic display of the battles that occurred during the time of Roman rule.  Ridley Scott's story of the General turned slave turned gladiator-- turned HERO, is truly captivating. The cinematography was seamless, the computer generated Roman Empire ie colosseum was so real, it was like you were there, while the action sequences were ""out-of-your-seat"" exhilarating.  Russell Crowe's (Maximus) performance, as usual was brilliant, showing he has the ability to add depth to all the character's inwhich he plays (ie The Insider, LA Confidential, The Gladiator). Crowe's presence is felt from start to finish.  As the evil and mad-hatter Caesar, Joaquin Phoenix  plays Commodus the Son of Marcus Aurelius perfectly. Though all three, Crowe, Phoenix, and Nielson (as Lucilla) bring together this epic to make this a truly spellbinding experience. Missing out on two Academy Awards for LA Confidential and The Insider (though much deserved), Crowe hopefully should see a look in for this years nominations -- if not, there must be something seriously wrong.  This is definitely a BIG-SCREEN experience, a must see.  I give it 10/10. Keep up the truly great performances Russell!",Gladiator
1860,JoeSooner,I loved this movie!,10,8 May 2000,"After reading some of the other reviews found here, it appears that you either get this movie, or you don't.  Well, I did in a big way, and I feel sorry for those who didn't.The details have been explained in detail in other reviews, so I won't bother with that. Suffice it to say that I was completely absorbed in this movie, primarily due to Russell Crowe's performance. Crowe is rapidly becoming my favorite actor, and he plays this role perfectly.  Others have commented negatively about the historical accuracy, and long running time, but I never noticed, and really did not want this movie to end.Do yourself a big favor and GO SEE THIS MOVIE!! Unless you're dead set on being critical, or determined not to get it, then stay away so I can have a better seat to see it again.",Gladiator
1861,Spamcoe,"Like a nice, slightly ill-fitting suit",8,9 May 2000,"I liked this movie: it had good action, some intrigue, the sets were beautiful, etc. However, it suffered from a few editing problems. For instance, the scene when the senator advises Commodus to imitate the sea-snake: why? Nothing comes of it. Was there a piece of story line that fell to the cutting-room floor? Visual mis-edits abound: gladiators in a tortoise in the center of the arena, then a scene of milling shields, then a faraway scene of the tortoise again. I found it distracting. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, but it left me feeling like I bought a nice suit that doesn't fit quite right. Having seen Ridley Scott's Director's Cut of Blade Runner, and finding it superior to the original, I wonder how satisfied he is with Gladiator as it plays in the theaters now.",Gladiator
1862,*vivienne*,Best movie this summer,9,2 June 2000,"I don't know why everyone is ragging on the plot; even though it was predictable at times, it was still gripping. I think this is the best movie I've watched the whole year; the visuals are just breathtaking. I haven't seen such beautiful cinematography since What Dreams May Come. George Lucas should ask Ridley Scott for some tips because while the special effects in Gladiator were less flashy, I believed it was real. Compare the computer graphics of the cityscapes of Rome to those in (whatever that city was called) in Phantom Menace. Same technical quality, but the stuff in Gladiator was a work of art. My only disappointment was the first battle scene. . . if I had watched the whole scene without turning away, I would have puked. Am I supposed to feel a rush just because they're pulling the film faster? The opening scene in Saving Private Ryan was by far superior. That had me ducking and wincing, Gladiator's did not. The acting was a bit cliche, on Russell Crowe's and Joaquin Phoenix's part, but so were their characters. I have to say though, I've never seen a better performance by Phoenix. In the scene where he kills his father, when he was giving that little speech about not being loved, I was moved to tears. That has got to be the most emotional scene in the whole movie . . . and a job well-done by Phoenix. Does anyone remember James Dean in East of Eden? Same speech, equally powerful. I wonder if that's where Phoenix got his inspiration. Overall, great movie. Too bad some people are anti-hype, anti-mainstream, because this film is really worthy.",Gladiator

I felt like I was there.",Gladiator
1864,sjuhawks19,One of the best I've seen in a while,10,12 May 2000,"Many movies that we all watch are disapointments because of all of the hype that surrounds movies (especially summer movies)now.  I was extremely excited to see Gladiator based on the trailer and the reviews I had read. This was one of the few movies where I was not disapointed at all.  Russell Crowe was outstanding as Maximus, as was Joaquin Phoenix as Commodus. Although I thought the movie could've used another battle scene or two, not once did I have to look at my watch or wonder when it was going to end, even after the 2 1/2 hours I just wanted more.  I won't go into the story line, because most reviews have already done that.  What I will say is that the first scene, the opening battle is in my opinion, the best scene of the film.  The cinematography for that scene was perfect, and like so many before me have said, it rivals the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan. Maybe not as intense, but the sheer action in the scene is breathtaking. The entire time I was watching it I couldn't help but compare it to Braveheart, which in my opinion is the greatest movie of all time. Although I still think Braveheart was a better film, Gladiator held it's own.  It is an epic, just as Braveheart was, and deserves to be held in the same regard.
Bottom Line:  It just makes you want to learn how to sword fight.",Gladiator

It was nice 3 hours to seat in the theatre, but when leaving it I thought ""It was great, but surely not the one I may be shocked"". Why ? May be because it's just a simple story which was pictured very well. But still a very simple story. Nothing to be shocked from. Nothing to discuss after.",Gladiator
1866,d.mcmenemy,A movie MADE for the big screen,10,7 August 2000,"It's hard not to react to the intelligentsia, who equipped with their Film Studies 101 from Cynics College seem to want to rip this movie to shreds. Gladiator is a wonderful piece of storytelling which paints a simple story very profoundly using all the tools available to the modern film-maker.I thought the acting was terrific, and Russell Crowe is wondrous in the role of Maximus, a man of courage and honour.  We can all share his pain as he fights for justice for his family and for Rome.  Maximus is a real hero who does what he has to do, not for personal glory or for wealth.  Joaquin Phoenix plays Commodus very well, at times you even sympathise for the spoilt brat.  But this film belongs to Crowe, I can honestly not remember a movie where a central performance has been so guaranteed to catapult the actor to mega-stardom.This is the type of movie cinemas were made for.  Take off your cycnic hat and go and see a film that tells the kind of story that made your ancestors believe in real heroes.Every other summer movie judged against this just pales.  See this on the big screen, I urge you.  This film will move you.",Gladiator
1867,elley,Let's go back in 180 AD...,10,29 May 2000,"Though the plot of Gladiator is completely fictional, using historical characters requires keeping a certain accuracy. In this respect it is intersting to learn who Emperor Commodus really was... Marcus Aurelius became emperor in 161, and until 169 he reigned in cooperation with Lucius Verus, husband of his eldest daughter Lucilla. Then the latter died. In 177, Marcus Aurelius associated his son Commodus to official functions in order to prepare him for the succession. In that sense, Marcus Aurelius reestablished the blood succession. Marcus Aurelius died shortly after the victory against thr Danubian barbarians near the actual Vienna in 180, but, he wasn't strangled by his own son as in the film, but died or of the plague or of exhaustion.Commodus becomes emperor, but shows little ability to succeed in his new functions. He concluded a quick peace with the barbarians, came back to Rome and actually did not care about politics. He lived in his world of laziness and lust. Lucilla was very angry at him and did not like his lover Bruttia Crispina. She set a plot and an attempt was made to kill Commodus, but it failed. This marked the beginning of a series of executions within the royal circle and the senate. Dio Cassius, Roman senator said: ""The fear was shared by us senators.He killed an ostrich, cut off its head, and came towards us with the head in his left hand, brandishing his bloody sword in the right. He wagged his head to show he would do the same to us."" When he entered the senate, the senator had to salute him in this way: ""You are Lord, you are first, you are most fortunate. You are Victor, you will be victor; from everlasting, Amazonian, you are victor"". More than that, Commodus was clearly a mad man, influenced by oriental religious practices. He wanted Rome to be called Commodiana, and the Legion Commodian.. He called himself the Roman Hercules, and styled Rome the ""Immortal Fortunate Colony of the Universe""! All the months were given his names: Amazonius, Invictus, Felix, Pius, Lucius, Aeliuys, Aurelius, Commodus, Augustus, Herculeus, Romanus, Exsuperatorius. He applied Exsuperatorius (his own image of Jupiter) to himself regularly to show that he surpassed mankind in many ways... Many statues represented him as Hercules. Commodus loved the games. He often went to the amphitheatre and entered the arena dressed as Mercury, beginning his exhibition barefoot and in his tunic after having got rid of his garments!. According to the historian Aurelius Victor, he was ""so depraved that he often fought in the arena as a gladiator""!! He had a real fascination for gladiators and wild beast, and when he wanted in January 193 to kill two senators in sacrifice and to make a procession in Rome at the head of his gladiators, it became necessary to get rid of this dangerous psychopath! His surroundings plotted, and Marcia, his favorite lover handed him a cup of poison, and he was then strangled in his bath by his coach, Narcisse, on December 31, 192. The reign of Commodus marked 12 years of terror, lust, cruelty and greed. He was obviously a megalomaniac. If a date can be fixed for the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire, it would be his reign. In the film, his folly is well represented, but in a different way though. We can see that he is a megalomaniac the way Ridley Scott made him enter Rome, and through the fact that he wants to rule alone. We als see that he loves the games, since he introduces 150 days of gladiators' fights. But his obsession with religion has been replaced by an incestuous love for his sister, whom he nearly consider as a goddess. But he didn't die in the arena (though he often fought as a gladiator), but was murdered. Nevertheless,with an astonishing photography and editing,  Ridley Scott's Gladiator is one of the best epics of the last 20 years, and will remain as such in many people's eyes...hopefully!",Gladiator
1868,warrior-plague,Pretty damn good movie,10,26 May 2000,"Gladiator is, in my opinion, a very good movie. It has a certain style not likely to be bested soon.

1869,thiswas,"Unnecessarily Prolonged, disappointment...",1,20 May 2000,"First 1/3 of the film is great, I watched with my jaw opened. Then came the boredom. Boredom from prolonged dialogues and Joaquin Phoenix's acting.Last week I read Paul Newman quit acting after all these years. The reason he explained ""I am sick of all these sex and violence in today's movies""I couldn't agree more, why on earth do we HAVE TO watch more and more queer, incest and other sick scenes in today's movies? I exclude films like Flawless or As Good As It Gets from these as they are meant to be made from different perspectives of the life. The story is OPEN. If you hate drag queens don't watch Flawless, simple as that. There's no cheating here. But putting disturbing scenes into an ACTION movie like Gladiator is something else...I think film industry should be based on one major fact: entertainment. It doesn't have to resemble to REAL LIFE. Everything can happen in real life and we do not want to remember every DETAIL of it.Let's face it do we enjoy watching a pervert Emperor who's trying to screw his sister? or a dialogue like ""What do you want Maximus, a girl? a boy?"" I hope most of you people do not reply ""yes"" to those questions!",Gladiator
1870,steven-80,Mediocrity - How Ridley Scott yet again neglects the script in favour of the image,1,21 May 2000,"It wasn't surprising really. I should have known better, after all this had happened with the narratives in Legend, 1492.., Black Rain and even in his superior works Alien and Blade Runner(and will happen again, like Peter Pan?). Hope however springs eternal, and with the casting of Derick Jacobi some comparisons with the sublime I, Claudius were inevitably and subconsciously drawn. How desperately in need of those comparisons was this dire cocktail of flashy, confusing gore and risible 'intrigue' performed by a collection of actors who, with a few exceptions, appeared to have recourse to one facial expression to express the gamut of emotions required of them by an infantile, ludicrous and totally implausible script which took 2 1/2 hours to deliver a plot which could have been written on the back of a postage stamp.Are we so easily satisfied with mediocrity that we can praise this ramshackle, gloomy hi-tech affair as being the first 'epic' of the year 2000? Surely not. Even the highpoints of the film; the opening battle scenes and the chariots vs gladiators coliseum fight come nowhere near to matching the virtuoso displays in Saving Private Ryan and Spartacus.For the rest, give me a script instead of computer-generated images which if I want to watch I can do so on one of my son's computer games.Now if Mr Jacobi had been a screenwriter ...",Gladiator

1872,bristol_james,"satisfying epic, whatever the nit-pickers say",8,21 May 2000,"I've been reading numerous comments about this movie over the last few weeks and I've been amazed at how pedantic many of the criticisms have been. To all those of you complaining how weak and cliched the screenplay is I'd ask you to name one movie set in Ancient Rome where there is no clunky or camp dialogue. What do you want,exactly? How would you have improved it? Have a go, if you think you're so hot.I'm not saying it's perfect by any means. However, on balance, any reasonable movie-goer should be able to admit that the triumphs outweigh the failures: beautiful cinematography (the complaints that the choppy editing in the fight scenes make it difficult to follow...please...don't you think the intention might have been to give the viewer the feeling of being in the heart of the action?),strong performances (Crowe's magnetic in a slow-burning, intensely powerful, dignified performance: can you imagine if Mel Gibson, or...eek...Arnie had been given the role?; Pheonix was superb with a complex and fascinating villain; Neilson was quietly impressive as a woman torn between 4 men: father, ex-lover, brother and son; even Oliver Reed proved he could act when he could be ar**d) and a screenplay that was not without cliche, but was able to tell a big story very concisely (the scene with Commodus and Lucilla arriving in Germania had barely 100 words of dialogue, but gave us mountains of information about both characters).Those of you complaining that there was not enough back-story or information about the motivations of the key characters, do you honestly need every last detail to be explicit? You are allowed to use your imagination sometimes.To conclude, I'd say that it delievered everything that one could ask for from a film of that genre, and I felt I'd had my money's worth...even on second viewing. You can nit-pick any film you care to mention, but why not just sit back, enjoy the spectacle and let yourself be transported to another (historically inaccurate, fair enough criticism)era for a couple of entertaining and sometimes moving hours?",Gladiator

This is a great movie, mixing high-octane action with deep emotions, striking visuals, wonderful performances and a story that's involving and credible. Despite some freedom to historical fact it is as realistic as any movie ever can hope to achieve.

It generally takes an exciting prospect to get me out of my seat and down to my local cinema, and this film has that quality. When I first heard about the film, I was intrigued, especially when I heard Ridley Scott was to direct. Then people started talking about the remarkable special effects and fight sequences. I'd read some preview comments in the national press and that interested me more. I think what impressed me most about this film was not the prospect of Russell Crowe and friends in leather (however...), but the fact that there is no sex, no swearing, no gratuitous violence (apart from what is appropriate to the storyline). I thought the film was well-acted and not too far-fetched, quite believable in parts and very touching in certain scenes. I would go and see this film again (I probably will), and although I'll buy it when it's released on video, it's best enjoyed on the big screen. This film is an EPIC.

This time, he has made the first good picture on Imperial Rome since ""Spartacus"", a picture appealing even to those who do not appreciate the genre. From the opening scene to the film´s closing, the audience is drawn into the story and into history, led by brilliant camera work, solid acting, a captivating musical soundtrack setting the mood for every scene without interfering with the picture, and brilliant cinematography. Characters are well developed and realistic, true to historic records (in fact, history tells us that Commodus, the Emperor, was even more of a megalomaniac than he is portrayed in the picture. If the script writer had portrayed him as he really was, audiences would probably have considered it as too much of a Hollywood cliché...).

1884,ed_stevens,"Excellent film, but it's fiction, not history",8,27 May 2000,"Great battle scenes, fine cinematography, excellent musical score, first-rate acting.  For these reasons, I enjoyed the film.However, I really would have preferred it if they had made up the names of the characters and the world in which the action took place, rather than butcher Roman history.  Examples: Marcus Aurelius groomed Commodus as his successor almost from the time of his birth (he was given the title Caesar when he was five years old, and became joint ruler with Marcus in 177, three years before Marcus' death); Commodus is reported to be blond and handsome, and saw himself as another Hercules; Lucilla did plot against him, but was found out and killed in 182, early in Commodus' 12-year reign; Commodus was lecherous -- having a harem of 300 concubines and an equal number of young boys for his sexual pleasure; he often appeared as a gladiator in the coliseum spectacles; he was smothered to death as a part of a plot led by Eclectus, his imperial chamberlain, Quintus Aemilius, commander of the praetorian guard, and Marcia, his favorite concubine, not killed by a General Maximus, who does not even appear in the biographies of Commodus that I have read.I suspect that they could have made a movie just as exciting if they had made it historically accurate, and somehow I would have found that to be preferable.  However, it would have been far more difficult to find a hero, which is probably why they decided to create characters and events and pass them off as history.  Too bad.",Gladiator
1885,donohue76,One of the greatest ever,10,28 May 2000,"After seeing this movie for the 3rd time this afternoon, the ending still brought me to the point of tears. Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe combine to give one of the most powerful performances in an action/adventure/drama film since Saving Private Ryan. Other than Stand by Me, which i saw when i was just a kid, Gladiator, and Private Ryan are the only 3 movies that have ever brought me to tears. I only wish i would get an email address or agent address for Ridley Scott or Russell Crowe, just to write a letter of appreciation for the film. I saw MI2 the other day, and was grossly disappointed. More like Mission Ridiculously Proposterous, Gladiator is a far superior film. After i saw it the first time, i just sat there after the movie was over, unable to describe how much the movie touched me. I have recommended it to everyone from my mom, to Fraternity buddies, and have gone to see it each time with a new group of people who were seeing it for the first time. The soundtrack as well is amazing. The music alone brings me to tears, and as soft as i sound, i rarely cry at movies, where everything is scripted. But i listen to tracks 15,16, and 17, and i get teary eyed. The music is just very powerful and the vocals are incredibly haunting. Hans Zimmer did an amazing job, and while Hans did the ST for MI2, it doesn't compare. The whole package is an emotional tour de force, that isn't just a hack'em up bloody gorefest, despite the amount of killing that does occur, it has a story and emotion and brilliant acting by Russell Crowe and supporting cast.

To those who complained about the correctness of the history events: 95% of the whole literature is just fantasy, the rest of 5% is fantasy inspired from reality. What do you think Spartacus was indeed like? Like Kirk Douglas? How about Cleopatra, Moses, Jesus, Columbus, Shakespeare and all others? Do you think they did exactly what you saw on the screen?

I'm absolutely astonished at the other comments about this movie! I found the fight scenes to be uncomfortably gory and grim; and there were so many of them, and they went on and on and on! I had been told that it was thought provoking, a love story (??) and not very violent or gory.  What movie was that?  Certainly not this one!  I was also annoyed at the gratuitousness of his wife and son being killed, just so he could be pissed off enough to justify his desire for revenge. (just like most of the old Charles Bronson movies)  Wouldn't he have been pissed off enough by the murder of his beloved emperor, the betrayal of the 'ideals of the Roman Empire' and the fact that he was captured and made a slave?  Guess not.I went to the 9:00 pm show, and in between the battle scenes, I kept almost dozing off. I just didn't find the movie or the characters particularly interesting, engaging or compelling.  ""Gripping"" is a word I have seen in other's comments--I don't see it.  I was anything but gripped. In comparison to Braveheart, it was about as violent, but you didn't really care about any of these people or what they were doing.  Braveheart made me want to find out more about William Wallace and that period of history; Gladiator made me want to go see Thomas the Tank Engine in the next theater to wash those gory images out of my brain and put something light in there instead!I'm not trying to belittle anyone's opinions who loved this movie; I am just nonplussed by them.

The dark and shady forests of Germany, the greatness of Rome, etc. It's so lifelike, that you can feel the ancient air !Secondly, the actors : Russell Crowe is surely the best male actor of our time ! He proved it before in L.A. Confidential and The Insider, but this is even better . He's so real, that it's even scaring ! He became Maximus, that's for sure . But that's not all : Joaquin Phoenix is a disgusting, sadist animal (perfect), Connie Nielsen is elegant and majestic and poor Oliver Reed gave his best performance as Proximo .Despite all these things, you could say it's not enough - some say the movie's plot is too simple and that the conversations are dull and dumb . Well, they are surely not the wackiest and newest sentences, but what did you expect to hear - Shakespeare ?! The plot (I think) is just enough good for an action-drama like this . It's simple, you don't have to think about it for hours !And I've left the best thing for the last time : the movie has a great moral, which is nearly inimitable .

1898,chesarn,One of the Best,10,5 June 2000,"I think the critics have entirely missed the reason that people want to see this movie more than once and why some call it the best picture they have ever seen.  It isn't because of the action scenes or the digitized recreations, both of which are tremendously well done.  Nor is it because of the wonderful acting by several members of the cast or Ridley Scott's incomparable cinematography.  The fact is, none of these elements is independent; all are choreographed to work toward one theme in the movie. Scott has an exceptional talent for doing this, as shown by his other films such as Alien, where sound and action and acting were so seamlessly integrated to produce a sense of impending doom and terror.But in Gladiator the theme is entirely different and it is all embedded in the character of Maximus.  As in all the epic historical movies this is a study of virtue combined with strength. Maximus is at ease with himself, as are we, and the lack of internal conflict would normally cause us to loose interest, but he is such an admirable person that we become only more involved as the movie progresses.  The artifice and cruelty of Roman society, and of course the character of Commodus, are provided to enhance the sense of Maximus nobility.  But there is something in Maximus' which represents a fundamental link between nature and man, life and death, which is presented with such direct simplicity and appealing honesty that we must be attracted by it.Maximus is a man of the earth, a fact repeatedly illustrated in the movie, from his stated love of the land to the close-ups where he dusts his hands in the soil before battle.  More than this, he shows us a man whose strength comes from this devotion to the earth. If Ben-Hur gave us a man to admire for his devotion to faith, and Spartacus a man with noble conviction about human value and dignity, then Gladiator does equally well in showing a man whose attunement with nature is both  shield and sword, for whom death and life are part of one experience, and who has taken unshakable faith from those beliefs.A character in TV's presentation of Arabian Nights said that fairy tales show us how to win.  I think that drama and acting, at its best, shows us how to be, and the portrayal of Maximus has reached that height.  We are all carried along by this earth.  The inevitable forces it imposes on us finally transcend the society we create to shut it out.  Seeing this illustrated in a film can be a moving experience.If you don't see this, then all you see is a thin plot pumped up by fight scenes and computer graphics, which, however well done, will never be in a class with the great films of the past.",Gladiator

1900,maximus-10,"Beautiful, thrilling, action packed...",9,6 June 2000,"Even with the typical annoying theater patrons talking and ruffling there packages of Reeses Pieces, this was the fastest two and a half hours of my life.  The film was beautifully done and the story line was intriguing. Russel Crowe is destined to be a huge star.  I haven't seen him in a film that he hasn't carried.One can't help but see the similarities between Gladiator and Braveheart. A lot has been said about this, and I would have to agree that they are there. However, I can say that Gladiator gives you a much more exciting and uplifting film experience.  While Braveheart gave us a dark and dreary Scotland, Gladiator gives us a bold and beautiful protrait of Rome. Gladiator has the dark undertones of its story line, however is filmed in a way that takes them in a lighthearted manor, giving the audience a more exciting ride.I gave Gladiator a 9 out of 10, on sheer excitement.  As I sit here and write this review, a get the feeling that it should be higher than that. It was an exiting film and had the great battle scenes that mark a roman epic, however it was a whole lot more than that.  The acting was superb and the story was well written.  The directing, while not typical of Ridley Scott, was wonderful.  His use of CGI was the best I have seen as of yet.  He did rely on it, rather used it to make picture more beautiful.  The balance between the action and the storyline was perfect.  All and all Gladiator was a ride worth taking.",Gladiator

1902,angelo-29,Breathtaking!,10,6 June 2000,"Once again, Director Ridley Scott proves to be as professional as one can be. The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world. Well, you should see for yourself!",Gladiator
1903,r_dymott,"Gladiator is the last of the great Roman epics, superbly brought to life by an amazing cast, outstanding scenery and special effects, shrewd directing and Hans Zimmer's emotional score.",10,19 June 2000,"Gladiator is the last of the great Roman epics, superbly brought to life by an absolutely amazing cast and some outstanding special effects and scenery perfectly complimented by Ridley Scott's shrewd directing. It tells the story of Maximus, a General in the Roman army sent to Germania under the watchful eye of Emperor Marcus Arelius to conquer the last barbarian tribes holding out. Marcus is dying and after the battle, tells Maximus that he is to become Rome's new ruler. Having broken the bad news to Commodus, his evil son who responds by punishing dad, Maximus is accused of treason and sentenced to death. The rest of the film focuses on Maximus' rise as a gladiator having been discovered by Proximo, an ex-gladiator who has been granted his freedom. Maximus' career culmilates in a brathtaking finale in Rome and the Colosseum. We all know what that means, a final showdown with the newly self-elected Emperor Commodus, providing of course Maximus and his Gladiator friends survive the trials that the new Caesar throws at them. The film itself stands out from previous epics with its technically perfect fight scenes in the Colosseum and at the beginning with the German barbarians.Russel Crowe must be an Oscar winner for his superbly emotional performance as Maximus. The film is very emotional in places and this is perfectly multiplied by Hans Zimmer's score which must also be an Oscar nominee.Joaquin Phoenix portrays evil Emperor Commodus as the weasely snide Roman we all know he is. Oliver Reed's final performance as Gladiator trainer Proximo must also not be ignored. All in all, Gladiator is one of the greatest films i have ever seen and i would strongly urge everybody to go and see it regardless of what you have planned for that day. Purchase the soundtrack too and play it as loud as your player will allow.This film kicks and is easily one that will make you cry your eyes out come the end. 100% easily-and don't forget the Oscars.",Gladiator
1904,Sheila-37,Acting blew me away.,10,7 June 2000,"Having just seen ""The Insider"" a couple of weeks ago, I was already impressed with Russell Crowe.  This film shows his versatility.  And maybe it was just the role, but he reminded me of a young Richard Burton.Connie Nielson was excellent also; I had never heard of her before.The one who really awed me though was Joaquin Phoenix.  From the movie reviews I was expecting the standard, pure evil bad guy, but this nuanced, complex performance made me feel the inner torture of this character and helped explain how he came to be who he is.  I didn't like him, but I couldn't hate him.Even if you don't care for bloody fighting scenes this movie is worth seeing if you love top-notch acting.  I will be surprised if we don't hear about ""Gladiator"" again at Oscar time.",Gladiator

1906,maarten-18,Prepare to be shut up :+),10,10 June 2000,"Thinking to see another silly hollywood action movie with some american rambo-cowboy pretending to be a roman soldier i went to see gladiator. But when the lights went out and the movie started, like everybody else in the theatre, all i could do is hang on to my seat and stare at the screen and be totally impressed. This movie is just amazing, its been years since any motion picture got a hold of me in any way whatsoever (last one was URGA, another must see if you love good movies) I had  completely forgot what it was like to be gripped, thrilled and be pulled into a story by a master director. Perhaps the good thing about it was i had no idea what to expect, didn't even know who directed it. After the movie ended the surprising thing was it was the silence in the theatre, everybody was so impressed nobody felt the need to talk. My advice is, if you want to see what a real motion picture is like, go and see gladiator in the cinema. For me this is the ultimate in its genre, completely thrilling action, great dramatic story and totally believable caracters. Of course the fact it shut up 500 noisy macho's in the theatre is something worth mentioning too :)",Gladiator

I hated the fact that Commodus came across as such a whiny spoiled I-hate-my-father-because-he-loved-Maximus-more-than-m e bad guy.  What was so bad about him???  I'm sorry but if you're going to have a badass like Maximus in the movie, you'd better have a hell of a tyrant to go up against him.",Gladiator

I am firmly in the former camp, and think that those in the latter are forgetting that this film stems from a line of films praised for their scale, imagery, and audacity (Fall of the Roman Empire, Spartacus, Cleopatra...), not for their genre-breaking content.This film has all the components - a stunning lead performance by Russell Crowe, fantastic support (particularly Joaquin Phoenix, Oliver Reed, and Richard Harris), visuals to die for, fantastic action scenes, and a romantic storyline that is perfectly handled.

A breathtaking performance by Russell Crowe, and one of the best supporting casts I've ever seen make this a perfect film.  Joaquin Phoenix is perfect as Commodus, as he makes you hate him.  The story itself is simple, but simplicity can be a good thing.  We don't need complex storylines for movies to be good.  In all of my favorite films, I can pick out at least a few small problems, whether it be in dialogue, acting, or plot inconsistencies, but with Gladiator, everything is completely perfect.

1927,ocsene,Disappointment will rise.,1,28 December 2000,"I don't know if this contains any spoilers, but you probably don't want to read this before viewing this movie.  I went unto the movie theater with excitement.  All the reviews that I had read about this movie raved about it's perfect marriage of stunning action and well-constructed plot.  What I found was an unrepentent melodrama of the worst stripe.  The audience nearly boo-ed and hissed everytime the villain came on screen, and cheered heavily upon the protagonist.  The script for Spice-World has more depth, and certainly more well-rounded characters.  Oh well, I thought.  At least I could sit back and enjoy the eye-candy.  And to a very limited extent, I did enjoy the gladatorial combats.  The only problem is that 90% of those scenes were in the commercials that had been run excessively before the release. Other computer-assisted action sequences were quite terribly done, such as the opening battle and all of the psychedelic flashbacks.  Overall, I feel that this is an embarrassing abortion of a movie.  It's popularity proves to Hollywood that the market for Steven Seagal movies is still expanding fast.",Gladiator

1929,kcelloboy8,Positive Comments on a great film!,10,20 July 2000,"When movies of gladiators and Ancient Rome are made, they are either very good....or very bad.  Thankfully, this is a very good movie. Russell Crowe (as Maximus) epitomizes the macho, testosterone-pumping tough guy, and turns in an Oscar-caliber performance. The fighting scenes are done masterfully, but of course they are extremely graphic.While the movie is historically accurate to a T, two flaws bother this Latin student. One- Marcus Aurelius was not strangled by his son Commodus; he caught a bad cold while going on a trip to the area which is now Vienna and died. The other mistake, involves the thumbs up/thumbs down policy in the arena. When a gladiator was chosen to be killed, the audience raised their thumbs down, not up.Overall, the movie may have some minor flaws in the dialogue, but I believe that the movie's intention was to show a hero, one who faced adversity and death with little fear. Alas, why can't the world have more Maximuses, people who value hard work and little apathy?",Gladiator
1930,Aurora-34,Words cannot do this movie justice,10,30 July 2000,"I went to see Gladiator fully expecting to be completely bored out of my mind. Instead I came out of the movie with a new all-time favorite. I can't decide where to start on what I liked most. The acting was absolutely brilliant. I have a great amount of respect for Russell Crowe now, due to the strength and compassion he put into this film. However, I feel that Joaquin Phoenix did the best job in acting. He took a character that could have been one huge cliche, and turned him into a sadistic and cruel villian that you actually had a reason to despise.This preformance alone has turned me into a huge fan. All people involved in this film are deserving of any awards they might receive. The manner in which the film was shot was breath-taking. From Germanian forests to Rome, the scenery in this film is amazing. I am also a huge fan of the soundtrack. Rarely has a soundtrack nearly brought me to tears, but this one does almost any time I hear it. Listening to it alone brings back emotions that I've never felt listening to a soundtrack. It's about time that there is a film out there now that makes you want to cheer for the hero, hiss at the villian and see the movie over and over again. Hopefully Hollywood will follow suit with more films like this in the near future.",Gladiator

Crowe managed to portray the simple, yet complex spirit of a man who's given in to his destiny. It was hard for me to believe a movie was going to be made that held both plenty of gore, and plenty of humanity. Well done to the creators of this masterpiece. A better film on the brutality of Rome's gladiator games is yet to be seen.",Gladiator
1932,jason.garbett,"""A film like they used to make""",10,10 August 2000,"I wasn't expecting the film that I actually saw when I went to see Gladiator. Yes there was lots of violence, yes there were big name stars and yes there was unrealistic dialogue. But what I hadn't anticipated was, plenty of atmosphere, an absorbing story and not over the top acting (well not a lot). I have read some of the negative reviews and they seem too heavily based on the story being unrealistic, ""could not have possibly happened"", too violent or not violent enough, ""nothing like Spartacus"". At least they are trying to make films like Spartacus which had more attention grabbing actors than you can shake a stick at. It would be difficult to say I enjoyed the film as it was a sad story in all where the happy ending was really not that happy. It started with violence and ended with violence. But I can honestly say, I was glued to the screen, thought the soundtrack was superb and believed I was there in every scene. Russell Crowe was made for Maximus although Oliver Reed seemed a bit lost in his part. I would recommend everyone to go and see it for themselves and enjoy it for what it is ....a STORY.",Gladiator

1935,comingaround,One of the Greatest Movies I have Ever Seen,10,19 August 2000,"This is wonderful storytelling.  The opening Battle Scene simply mesmerizes, showing the brutal nature of combat for Roman conquests.  I went back to see the film again.  The first time I didn't hear anything Crowe said before the battle.  I was just too visually caught-up.  The second time I listened very closely and caught the wise yet succinct line from Maximus ""what we do in life... echoes in eternity.""  Awesome.A simple man v. an emperor.  I just loved the resilience Maximus showed throughout the movie.  I find in most movies, there is an irritatingly slow process where the character has to ""find himself,"" not so with Gladiator. Maximus does what is needed.I liked how there were only two or three issues within this film.  One was the afterlife.  Aspects of the afterlife are opened, but not overdone.  Love of family is given sizable focus. I liked the theme of love of country that we see as well, although it may not be justly deserved, it is never questioned.The visual effects were amazing.  It actually had me wanting to believe that's the way Rome actually looked in all it's glory.  The battle of Carthage reenactment was really great.The ending is just hypnotic. Intentionally or unintentionally it was simply emotional.  The music is wonderfully beautiful as if Maximus' family are telling him...you have arrived.Bottom line: magnificent.  Visually and emotionally satisfying.",Gladiator
1936,midas-7,The Coliseum as if you were there,7,24 August 2000,"When I was in Rome last year I was quite moved by the visit of the Coliseum. As I had a look at the huge circus and the open basement, I could really imagine it in its glorious days full of shouting people on the rows of seats, Cesar in the tribune, and gladiators preparing themselves for the fight.I hoped Ridley Scott's movie would bring this excitement back and I am not disappointed. Roman way of life displayed in the movie is quite believable. It is a long way from old peplum movies which didn't care much for historical accuracy. However, this search for accuracy is restricted to environment and real events are altered according to the needs of the scenario. This is a bit frustrating and prompts me to refresh my student's memories.In spite of this frustration I like the movie as a whole. Good actors playing believable characters and amazing fight scenes keep in suspense until the end.Sorry for my poor English which doesn't allow me to develop my opinion as completely as I wish ! To summarize, I recommend the movie.",Gladiator

Russell Crowe was cool as hell in this movie and Ridley Scott did amazing job directing the action scenes.  This movie was my one of the best film I've ever seen.  This movie's DVD rocks too.

1938,-Miha-,The most strong feelings: disbelief and frustration,4,6 September 2000,"I'm not going to talk about the historical truth - one should not expect this from epic movies anyway. The problem is - I cannot understand where is this meaningful 'plot' in this movie. A Roman prince cannot dispose of a slave? (recipe: kill him silently, then kill at the Arena someone who looks similar). One cannot kill a sleeping man (s)he wants to be dead? (this man IS reachable and how about a poison instead of sleeping pills?). A new emperor suffers from a lack of female attention?(does word 'hetaera' ring a bell?).But the above is not the worst. The worst is the characters. They are flat and lifeless. Chess pieces have more personality. In the real life if a homo sapiens does something, this means  he has some reason to do it (this reason may be an emotional one but it does exist). Not so in this movie. If Commodus does something, it serves only one of the purposes: to show how evil he is, or to advance the 'plot'. Don't try to find a reason or to understand why he does something - the story-writer wants him to do it and that's enough here. Maximus - see above but replace 'evil' with 'good or suffering'. Lucilla exists to build schemes , to be the weakest point of these schemes and to be a woman (almost the only one in the movie). That's all. Behind almost every scene I see a shadow of the story-writer who wants this scene to be that way - no matter does it make any sense or not, no matter if such scene is even slightly possible. Frustrating.Don't get me wrong - the movie is beautiful and visually detailed. But I expect of a movie significantly more than to be a set of beautiful pictures.2 for the story and 10 for everything else.",Gladiator
1939,ben4482,"Entertaining, yet flawed",6,24 January 2001,"Gladiator, though entertaining, is one of the most overrated movies of the year.The biggest problem with this movie is the direction during the battle and fight sequences.  The camera is too close to the action.  This closeness causes many problems.  First of all, the close camera work during the fight scenes left me feeling cheated.  The close camera work puts us into the action a little too much, and some of the fight sequences weren't as exciting as they could have been if there were a few wide shots put in there.  This closeness also made the ""special effects"" of the Colosseum look hokey.  The people siting in the nosebleed sections of the stadium looked fake (granted, they WERE computer generated, but shouldn't they at least appear real?).Other problems with this movie include cliches (""On my signal, unleash hell""), anachronisms (Maximus says something in Italian, though the language doesn't appear until much later) and historical inaccuracies (Marcus Aurelius didn't die that way the last time I checked)Other than that, this movie is an entertaining one.  The acting is excellent, especially by Joaquin Phoenix as the evil twit Commodus.  All in all, I would recommend this movie simply for entertainment purposes.  As for Best Picture of the year...I think not.**1/2 out of ****",Gladiator

My compliments to Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe for a 5-star must-see movie, at least in my opinion.",Gladiator
1943,TREBORDEAN,Best film I've seen for years,10,20 November 2000,"Heroic performance from Russell Crowe. Oscars all round for this film.Not your normal blood and guts epic, but one in which the hero, Maximus, has genuine feelings, that are conveyed brilliantly by Crowe.I hope he does not get saddled with too many hero type pictures as he is capable of far more. I believe we still have yet to see the best from this Antipodean actor, but this performance was not far off.Brilliant story, well acted, well told and also a special mention for Oliver Reed who gave his best performance (even though he was unable to finish the movie) for years.",Gladiator
1944,ken.lin,Watch it for the mise-en-scene,3,3 February 2001,"First, the good things about this movie:  costumes, set, decorations, and locations, and an excellent beginning fight sequence.Otherwise, I have to agree with others that this is a poor movie with a weak story.  Every character was one-dimensioned and shallow:  Russel Crowe as a honorable warrior-family man who who cannot be corrupted by power, Richard Harris as an aged ruler who realizes his legacy should not be about the size of his empire but about the people, Joaquin Phoenix as a conflicted boy who feels unloved by his father, so on and so forth.Ridley Scott is contrived and conventional.  *Possibler spoiler*  Case in point: on a deleted scene on the DVD where Lucilla admits that Commodus may have to die to save the Roman Empire.  Scott says this was the first time Lucilla expressed her ambivalence regarding her brother and Scott decided to delete the scene say so he can stretch the ambiguity.  Hello - was that ambiguity not painfully obvious after we see them together for 10 minutes!?Hans Zimmer music does not help other - the score sounded like `Lion King' plus `The Prince of Egypt' without the musical numbers.Overall, the film is problematic and a disappointment.  I rank it a 5 out of 10.  Watch it for the mise-en-scene.",Gladiator

1946,maguiregary,Where have I seen this before?,3,6 November 2000,"This movie is the most unoriginal movie ever made, as it is basically a re-write of Braveheart.  Too many people caught up in the hype, have hailed it as a masterpiece but I've seen it all before.  Russell Crowe gives a good performance, but I was left bored and unimpressed.",Gladiator

The portrayal of Maximums was true to all of the stories I have read or heard. This is a Great movie, I would recommend it to anyone. The violence is not that bad for the type of movie it is. There are some scenes that are brutal. If you haven't seen it rent it, and I am sure will be the proud owner of Gladiator after you watch it.",Gladiator
1951,newelly,Amazing Special Effects Unamazing storyline,5,29 December 2000,"I suppose all the hype surrounding Gladiator really heightened my expectations of the movie but once it has been taken off the big screen it really loses its gloss and power. Movies that stand the test of time are the ones that are still good to watch on the small screen because they contain interesting plot elements/twists and great dialogue. Gladiator contains none of the former and an average amount of the latter. This story was meant to be an action film but contained a lame dull cliche'd ending. No great Roman hordes overthrowing the Corrupt Emperor, really made me and my friends feel short changed and that is difficult to say after sitting through a 140 minute movie. The Special effects were brilliant and its worth a look for them alone but its not a movie I will watch again in a hurry and will not stand the test of time. There were no plot twists, just predictable gladiator fighting scenes and a good battle in the opening scenes between the Roman army and the Germanic peasants. As far as epic movies go Braveheart is better in pretty much every aspect that counts - plot and acting, as well as Bravehearts' battle scenes being less movie-goer friendly and more gruesome and realistic than Gladiators'.",Gladiator

You have never, and will never see a film like Gladiator. Everything is perfect, from the storyline and the stunning visuals, to the soundtrack and the casting. Russell Crowe is brilliant as the defiant General/slave/gladiator Maximus, and Joaquin Phoenix is perfect as the evil tyrant Emperor Commodus. 10 out of 10.",Gladiator
1953,Cypher24,Best Movie I've ever seen,10,30 November 2000,"I consider myself a movie-goer. I went to see Gladiator and i was just left breathless and wanted to see more. I saw the movie another time at an iMax and recently bought the DVD. I give Gladiator a 5/5 stars. Some people may question my decision. What i hear a lot of the time is that there wasn't enough action. I agree with that to some extent. But i remind those people that this is not supposed to be a pointless shoot and kill, schwarzenneger-type movie (though i enjoy his work too), this is supposed to be a movie about epic proportions which shows the advancement and corruption of Rome and how a Gladiator defied it. That was exactly what i expected, and i was not only not disappionted, i was left breathless. I was sorry to leave the theatre after those amazing 2 and a half hours. Now, i cannot say that the movie was flawless and perfect. There were minor things like Commodos talked too much or the Senate seemed insignificant to him, though they were clearly stating that they weren't. Other than that, i cannot see anything else wrong with the movie. I was also drawn back by Russell Crowe's performance. I was very impressed my The Insider and thought that Russel or anyone else couldn't do better. When i saw Gladiator, I knew that Russel Crowe is a REAL actor and you don't look at the price tag he/she demands to see if they can act. I am now very much anticipated Proof of Life and any other movie that he will star in, no matter how dumb the plot seems. His acting has also gotten better, from Quick and the Dead to LA Confidential to Insider to Gladiator. I expect that this will be rising until the highest possible extent.In other words, if you haven't seen Gladiator or even heard of Russell Crowe, get out of under that rock and go to your nearest video store. You will not be disappointed. That is a guarentee.",Gladiator

The story line was great, the sets and scenery were astounding and the acting was magnificent. But, for me, it was Joaquin Phoenix who stole the show. I had previously been a fan of his after seeing Inventing the Abbotts, Return to Paradise and 8mm, but he truly shone in this as the EVIL emperor. Russell Crowe was brilliant and portrayed Maximus very well. If this film does not win Best Film at the Oscars, I'll eat my hat!",Gladiator

The acting is top rate, from the brooding protagonist to the deranged roman nobility with delusions of control.. this film is a must see. Of all the DVDs I have I rank this set with Saving Private Ryan as the one I keep returning to. It's packed full of excellent bonuses, though nothing compares to the soundtrack and visuals. There is also a cool easter egg - see if you can find the Rhino Video and Script on the bonus disc.",Gladiator
1958,Zeddmore,Mindless and Predictable.,1,9 February 2001,"Gladiator is filled with so many tired old cliches that I can only sum it up with a tired old reviewer cliché.  Leave you brain at the door.This movie starts off with a large battle scene where Roman army Sargent, Russell Crowe, displays a unique ability to fight with courage and honor. Yeah!  Unfortunately for him he is more concern with getting home to his family where he can raise his children and grow his crops.  The only thing that is keeping him in the army is a strong devotion to his Caesar.After winning the opening scene (Believe me, I am not spoiling anything imdb.) Crowe's Caesar comes down from the mountain where he has overlooked the battle to congratulate him.  As soon as I saw the old and feeble Caesar get off his horse I literally counted the seconds before the Caesar's `jealous of Crowe' younger brother or son came walking onto the scene.  28 seconds later the Caesar's son who it conveniently late for the battle, enters the scene. Things really heat up when the Caesar names Crowe as his successor instead of his son.  What follows is one movie cliché after another until a final battle scene between Crowe and Caesar Jr.I have enjoyed movies that followed this kind of formula in the past. Spartacus and Braveheart are my two favorite examples.  But what those movies have that Gladiator lacks is simple.  Character.  Ridley Scott's direction should have been more focus on giving his lead roles a third dimension instead of dragging out action.  The bland story and flatness of the characters made me wish that everyone would die so I could arrive home sooner.Although Gladiator did have well choreographed fight scenes and some good computer generated special effects; as most movies today, they left the script as a last priority which this reviewer still believes should be the whole point of movie making.",Gladiator
1959,peter.cosyn,"a blockbuster, but an immortal one!",10,16 December 2000,"When I decided to see the movie, I had no idea of his impact. I thought it was just one of those blockbusters such as ""The Phantom Menace"". But I was impressed of Russell Crowe's performance in the Insider, a superb film. So I just went to the cinema, sat back in my chair and let the film overwhelm me. I missed no second of it; it was great. The music, the great pictures, great actors and again a superb Crowe. Some of the scenes were immortal: the moment they entered the arena, the opening scene, ... Maybe it is the most impressive film I've ever seen (yeah even better as Braveheart, my favourite). All right, maybe this film was not historical correct and had not such a great story such as the Godfather but that's of no importance to me. There are other things that make from this movie an all-time classic, just sit back, relax and be impressed!",Gladiator

At first i thought it was just going to be a one of those blood thirsty over the top films , how wrong could i be . It had me gripped all the way through ,i could not take my eyes of the screen once. It has everything i like in a film it has action so it doesnt get you bored it has a hearty element so that you can walk away from watching the film and feel like you were somehow part of it and it is one of those film that makes you want to see it twice because you dont quite beleive what you have just seen.What really compliments this film is the colliseum scenes which were to me so enjoyable it is a action packed thrill ride all the way . Russell Crowe does a fabulous job as Maximus , i am glad he was given the role instead of mel gibson because i dont thing gibson could of done the part right. As always his acting was of high quality and was worthy of the praise it was given.He definitely looked the part and has never made a roman warrior look quite so handsome. Joaquin Phoenix is also a fabulous actor and handled the role as comedos really well putting alot of feeling into his performance , he deserved to have gotten a best supporting actor oscar for the performance. Connie Neilson looked the part and was another great element to the film , i feel her acting was underated as she was the only women i think who could have carried of that role as superbly as she did and she was another one of the films great attributes that should have done better at award ceremonies. Most of the praise for this film should go to ridley scott who as always made an incredible film that hollywood should be proud of.

Then dying in a ""terribly unnecessary death"".For the directing i would give a shout out to Ridley Scott who chose the perfect places to shoot in and making a really good impressions.Regarding actors, I've got a weakness for Russell Crowe, I even liked his version of Robin Hood because of him, even though the plot actually sucked. Russell made a brilliant work on this film, speaking of playing, speaking and even expressions.But the savior of the day is nobody else than Hans Zimmer.

The movie paints a beautiful view of Rome, its armies, the leaders and the land. Again, the acting is impeccable. In fact, the movie is so well done, there have been rip offs of it made. For instance, see Troy. A mediocre film with mediocre actors. As well, the direction is so much better. The fight scenes in Gladiator are beautiful, yet don't focus on the gore, as if to make some cheesy thriller. It's all about the plot, and the results are delicious. The movie never gets old.

Russel Crowe was very good, but I do not believe he should win an academy award compared to the other actors of 2001.

The battles, the intensity, the overall rawness of this movie is right up there with Ben Hur, Sparticus or any other movie of it's kind. When ever I want to sit down and watch a great movie I'll watch Gladiator. Cinematography is excellent. I can't actually find any fault with this movie. Phoenix was so great and so genuine as an evil ruler you want to go through the screen and choke him to death. All the fight scenes with gladiators against gladiators, and gladiators against with the tiger was outstanding. The friendship of the gladiators waiting for there turn to live or die in the arena's was also a big part of this movie.",Gladiator

It's won Best Picture so obviously it's the best movie of the year! The fight scenes are breathtaking but ,although it has a well developed plot, it does tend to get a bit dull at times.

Not much in the movie is true about Commodus. He did not kill his father (the plague took him, and Commodus wasn't even there). Neither Commodus was killed on any arena (actually he was assassinated). There is much more big mistakes, just find a history book and you will be quite annoyed about the movie.It's a fictional movie, and it's allowed to change things.

Beautiful cinematography, sound work and lovely acting of Russell Crowe and all others made it a marvel.
I didn't rated it 10/10 because I feel nothing in this world can ever be 100% though in past 20 years this movie never made me feel like it has gone old yet in coming 10 years there might be a movie that might be placed at higher level.",Gladiator

Russell Crowe could be some kind of Van Damme in anyone of his movies.So, Gladiator clearly applies the typical action movie script to the roman world: No difference, nothing new, nothing at all.",Gladiator
2001,teiv,Stunning! Re-watchable.,10,15 May 2001,"I'm sure most people who like this movie, do it because of its strong orientation on one's feelings. It's quite the same thing as Titanic (although I didn't like Titanic), that simply attracts so many people who actually might have very different taste.Furthermore, it has something for everyone: action, intrigue, love (not merely between a man and a woman) and even history (only visual, though) - fantastic battles, costumes, and decorations. As these kind of movies are often considered to be just bare money-machines by a lot of critics, Gladiator goes far beyond that level. There are very few categories about the film that I wouldn't like to rate as perfect. The way Scott has managed to create an atmosphere of the time of Roman Empire, the pain you can see in Crowe's eyes almost all throughout the movie as the betrayed general Maximus, incredibly powerful soundtrack composed by H. Zimmer - these are the first thoughts that come in mind.Personally, I always get carried away by the anger and oppression that I feel together with Maximus. So even if there were more scenes that wouldn't remind me of his pain, it wouldn't really matter because the tension simply is already high enough, until the end. And the end is much more than a classic ""happy end"" would be, it is beautiful! So is the film itself, too.I simply had to give it 10/10, because of the effect it has to me everytime I watch it. Otherwise I wouldn't be fair.",Gladiator

My friend who studied Vergil with me and has taught Latin confirmed my impression that they had all the important historical details right.  The hommage to Leni Riefenstal when Commodus returns to Rome is killer. The scenes when Maximus prays to his portable Lares and Penates just blew me away.

Definitely check this one out. It is no wonder that Russell Crowe stole awards for this one. When I saw this, I walked out saying, ""Oh my God, Russell Crowe was so good in this."" I've seen it multiple times since it came out, and enjoyed it anew each time. I'm a big fan of historical dramas, so my predisposition likely colors this review, but I stand by my sentiments. The plot takes a number of twists and turns, leaving viewers in shock. I just bought it as a gift for my cousin, and am hoping he likes it just as much. The music is also very well-done, very appropriate for the context and setting of this film. I don't quite agree with the film being rated R, but it likely shouldn't be seen by anyone under 13. There is some violence, and the themes are a bit adult.",Gladiator
2007,bradhudson68,An excellent Action film with substance,10,8 June 2001,"Gladiator was an excellent example of what action films can be, when the writer and director truly care about the total presentation.  The film is mostly accurate with it's portrayal of the time period, and the writing gives the viewer a sense of connection with these men.  The violence was shown in a manner that did not detract from the story.  Before I saw the film I had trepidations due to the subject matter, but all the graphic shots were quick and to the point, showing the nature of the combat, but not ""gore for gore's sake"".Overall, one of the finest films I have seen.",Gladiator

Surprisingly to me the good eggs outweight the bad. The movie has an 80%+ acceptance and 20% not. From the 20% who said they didn't like the movie, well their description of the movie was quite dry. Pure context without content. They sound like they like blow up sheeps. Movies don't have to be real, or actual. Some have high expectations of the movie- boy should they have been directing the movie- we might get a piece of their mind.This movie along with, Saving private ryan, top gun, braveheart, etc are my favorites.",Gladiator
2010,cjmets11,Simply awesome,10,7 December 2006,"Gladiator still stands, to this day, as one of my favorite movies of all-time. A mix of drama and action, Gladiator tells the tale of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a general in Marcus Aurelius' army who shined in battle but was eventually deceived by the corrupt emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), suffered through the murder of his family, and was sold into slavery. While a slave, Maximus (there known as ""The Spaniard"") learns the techniques of gladiator battle and becomes Rome's greatest warrior, on a quest to seek revenge for the murders. Defeating Roman soldiers and other gladiators alike, his final battle comes against the emperor himself. In a glorious battle, Maximus slays his foe, earning the love and respect of the fans and of Lucilla (Connie Nielsen). Though not 100% factually correct, the miniscule errors do not take away from what I found to be a mind-blowing movie experience. Gladiator is a classic, and will always be a classic.",Gladiator
2011,mikeandmike_movies,Greatest MOVIE EVER,10,7 December 2006,"Gladiator is an extraordinary motion picture that successfully combines action and adventure with a dramatic storyline and excellent plot. It is simply the story of how a General became a slave, a slave became a gladiator, and a gladiator conquered Rome. Ridley Scott reaches his highest peak, and that's not easier considering his director resume of Alien and Blade Runner. Russell Crowe's acting is impressive, as always, but is perhaps outdone by Joaquin Phoenix, who plays a more cynical and emotionless character. The tag line describes the movie's purpose to perfection, What we do in life, echoes in eternity. The action scenes are very well done, and the dialogue fits the time period perfectly. There was a lot of controversy when it one best picture over the movie Traffic, but any one who appreciates movies can easily see why Gladiator took home this high honor. Most people have seen it, but I look forward to future movie lovers to enjoying it for the first time.",Gladiator

Maximus runs for his life, and ends up as a slave for a man who trains gladiators. Now his life involves gladatorial combat. After a while, General Maximus gets to know the fellow gladiators better-the ones who are alive at least.

2014,guy70289,Great Movie,10,12 December 2006,"The Gladiator, in my opinion is a great film. It really shows how one man's rage and quest for revenge can consume him. This film takes you through such dramatic chain of events such as Maximus going from being one of the greatest generals and almost Caesar of Rome to a lowly slave working and fighting to survive. And even in his low ranked position being able to overcome obstacle's and getting the revenge he deserves. The fights in the Colosseum really depict the amount of violence and the savageness that went on inside the Colosseum. Their was a immense amount of brutality just to please a crowd. Though the ending isn't very conclusive it is a just ending for our hero Mximus to end his painful quest.",Gladiator

2018,lenjinson,Classic Ridley Scott = Great film + Historical catastrophe,8,14 October 2020,"Every second of Crowe, Phoenix, and Harris is really amazing. The underlying theme of the film in my view is the topic of Stoicism, something that Scott seems to love exploring also in the very underrated Kingdom of Heaven (Director's cut) and Robin Hood. The cinematography is fantastic, and the story captivating.However, another mark of Scott is complete and utter historical inaccuracy. The way Rome is displayed, its grandeur, etc. All of it is very incorrect. Even the name of the main character is impossible. But, personally I never go to Scott for a documentary. I go to him for his ability to create an ethical argument to wrestle with in the film, and for gorgeous cinematography.If you like what I like, then you'll love Scott.",Gladiator

2021,angelobalzano7,gladiator,10,13 October 2006,"Gladiator is an extraordinary film because it is very spectacular and, at the same time, powerful, intense, vibrant, with a remarkable introspective analysis and representation.It also gives people a positive and edifying message. This film is accompanied by a splendid sound track, sometimes strong and intense, sometimes passionate and touching, that increase its value. Some passages of this sound track remind the music of Beethoven. In my opinion the film deserved more than five Oscars. In fact given that Gladiator in a very painstaking job, it should have deserved many more Oscars. For example I think that Gladiator is more exciting than Ben Hur which got eleven Oscars. Then I was very much disappointed that a a master as Ridley Scott, one of the best directors of the world, didn't win the Oscar. It's unfair that masters as Alfred Hitchcock or Stanley Kubrik have never won an Oscar. Every time I watch again the film I always think that it should have been still more memorable with the participation of Marlon Brando, who should have been perfect for the spirit and the style of the film. He should have been an unforgettable old roman senator. As a matter of fact in my life I have never seen an actor so able to express power, intensity, passion, magnetism, charisma. Just the characteristics of an important ancient roman personality.",Gladiator
2022,dwizo,I can't believe this film won Best Picture,4,15 July 2001,"This movie winning best picture is an example of how corrupt the Academy Oscar Award system must be, even Russell Crowe should not have won best actor (or even have gotten nominated period).  Tom Hank's performance in Cast Away was far better even if he has two oscars already and Cast Away itself wasn't that great.  Don't get me wrong though I believe that Crowe is a good actor and I would have given him a nomination for his role in L.A. Confidential.  Gladiator is a summer movie and that is all it was.  This movie was incomplete and full of cliches, and then out of no where the film ends abruptly, with of course a show down between Crowe and Phoenix.  I believe that Roger Ebert is a great critic, and have no problem with the rating he gave this film (one and a half stars), but I don't agree with how he rates certain films such as summer movies.  When a filmmaker makes a film such as a summer movie they usually aren't going after best picture, they're more going after giving you a ride, and if this is the case you should critique the film on this basis, and not judge it as though it was meant to be some kind of masterpiece in the art of film, however even on this basis Gladiator still somewhat fails.  I was given this film on DVD and I sold it without even watching it.  In order for a film to be worthy of beset picture or even good, the film must be tied up and have no loose ends, all issues should be dealt with and after the movie being almost 3 hours it actually has no story.  When I first (the only time I watched it) watched Gladiator I thought that there was going to be some kind of inventive story line and then out of no where the film turns into a senseless basher movie.  And if the Academy is going to allow films like this to continue to get nominations, some other film festival should be deemed more prestigious. This kind of thing is just scary, the next thing you know Pearl Harbour will get a nomination or probably even win.  Here's how it is, Gladiator is an alright (two stars) summer movie, but for a well made movie of Best picture quality watch something like Chocolat or Enemy at the Gates instead.PS. Just for the record, I have no problem with summer movies winning Best Picture as long as they're made properly, up to now the ""Empire Strikes Back"" is still my favourite film and I would have given it BP, and ""Star Wars"" also got a nomination because they were great and well made!",Gladiator

But then there are also several parts to the movie that are happy. Not only is the storyline of this movie amazing, but the script is wonderful as well. The characters acting skills are also terrific, making the film a definite ten. Unlike other movies, this film has no off shoots, and doesn't confuse you like others tend to do.

2028,grilledfish,Looks great! Is dumb!,2,2 August 2001,"I have to admit this movie looks great. Ridley Scott did a great job as the director and production designer. Moreover, the actors are superb. And Hans Zimmer's work as composer is awesome.However, there is one MAJOR complaint: THE SCRIPT!Ok, from a commercial point of view I can understand that it looked appealing to the producers. But what about Mr. Scott?The plot is a recycled Early-Eighties-Chuck-Norris-Movie put into the Roman setting.No twists. No suspense. Just action and some romance. No good movie!Gladiator is a B-Movie script made into a multi-million dollar piece of post-modern recycled junk.If you really want to see it, here is my recommendation:Rent the DVD or video and put it on fast forward. You will still get the simple story, some action and you won't have to waste two hours and thirty minutes just to be disappointed.My verdict: 2 out of 10 (for the looks, acting, and score)PS: Unfortunately, the producers felt obligated to insert a Saving-Private-Ryan-This-Feels-So-Real war sequence at the beginning.

The Roman Empire is in full blossom, having survived the excesses of one corrupt emperor after the next. The latest Caesar, Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), is a scholar who has taken to the battlefield to repel a barbarian threat from Germania. To that end, he has invaded, relying upon the leadership and valor of his best general, Maximus (Russell Crowe), to win the day.

The actors in this movie did a superb job. Russel crows performance was especially delightful as he inflicted pain on his opponents, his role in the film was crucial to my enjoying it.

2040,k-47757,Read the slogan.,10,9 June 2021,"I love historical films. You look, as if enchanted, at the battles that reach an epic scale, at all sorts of palace intrigues, secrets. Everyone watched them.But 'Gladiator' is out of this pack of movies. For 'Gladiator' is a legend film. The film is a phenomenon. For everything in this film is beautiful. Starting from the recreated ancient World and ending with the actors.And now you can sort it out in order:Actors: Crowe won an Oscar in his own right. I played emotionally, beautifully. How can a hero who has experienced such a tragedy and endures such suffering not be upset? Phoenix played a brilliantly cunning and scumbag man. During the viewing, I simply wanted to kill him, hit him in the face so hard. A tribute to Richard Harris, now deceased. Well played his character, Marcus Aurelius. Djimon Khonsu played the role of the philosopher quite well. I liked his sayings.Special effects: no wonder, no wonder this film won the Oscar for best Visual Effects, because these are effects that I have not seen in any historical film. The detail of the smallest details, the maximum approximation to reality, add great impressions to the film. The Colliseum and the entrance to Rome are very beautifully shown. Bravo!Setting up fights: I sat with my jaw open. Everything is so beautiful, spectacular, elegant, bloody and cruel filmed and staged and it wants to be reviewed and revised. The chariot scene is beautifully staged. And I liked, literally, the animal final fight.Scenery, costumes: beautiful, no words. Also, everything is recreated in the closest possible detail to reality. I liked the costumes of Maximus and Commodus, who was in the final. The women also had wonderful costumes, beautiful, emphasizing beauty and femininity.Camera work: great! The camera well conveys the atmosphere of the fight rushing from one corner to another. The camera takes beautiful panoramas, close-ups of Rome, and in general the surrounding nature so that you can choke with delight...Total: A movie for the ages. A legend of cinema. I deserve an Oscar.",Gladiator
2041,l-72149-07001,Movies with a capital letter.,10,9 June 2021,"I watched it recently, on the eve of the movie 'Robin Hood' and here's what I'll say...I don't always agree with the members of the American Film Academy, but I agree with the decision to give the main statuette to this film 200 %. I'm not the biggest fan of blockbusters, but I take my hat off to Sir Ridley Scott. People who make big-budget films are not few, but the people who really do it well can be counted on the fingers of one hand.I can only say good things about the film. The actors played brilliantly! Russell Crowe's face says-Man, this is the case when the actor fits the role just perfectly. In the eyes of Joaquin Phoenix, you can see the fear, his Commodus does not hide it, he is afraid...at first, he is afraid of not gaining power, and then losing it. He is disgusting in his envy and weakness, and in what actions they push him to do. Minor roles are also played on the level, and the characters are remembered.The military bribes with their loyalty and respect for General Maximus. How did he earn such respect? Yes, because he himself faithfully fulfills his duty to Marcus Aurelius and the Roman Empire. Everything he does, he does sincerely: he loves his family, his home, his Emperor (Marcus Aurelius, of course), believes in God and prays regularly. This sincere love and loyalty, combined with his boldness and courage, arouse similar feelings for Maximus himself and make him a Man who is followed not only by soldiers, but also by slaves and senators, even the Emperor trusts him more than his son.Hans Zimmer wrote great music for the film, just gorgeous. However, he is always on top.I will not retell the plot, I will only say that I liked it. I rarely get emotional, but I shed a tear for the third time in my life while watching a movie, the first two: when Jews leave stones on the grave of Oskar Schindler, and during the execution of John Coffey, in all the famous films. I am not a fan of history, and I will not find fault with the fact that the plot does not quite correspond to it.But I love movies, and movies that evoke emotions, make you think, ask yourself questions, raise my moral bar I love twice.Tell me I'm sentimental? Maybe I don't see anything wrong with that.",Gladiator

Despite the fact that the appearance of this warrior of bygone days was clearly unfriendly, there was something in his image that betrayed in him boundless longing and sadness.On the radio, the same slogan rang out in incessant rhetoric: The general who became a slave! A slave turned gladiator! A gladiator who refused to serve the emperor!I will say frankly that then-in 2000 - I was not familiar with the actor named Russell Crowe, but the figure of the director, in conjunction with all the factors listed above, convinced me of only one thing - I must see this film in the cinema!

2043,y-32089,"""Strength and honor""",10,9 June 2021,"The genre of historical cinema, and indeed films of this kind have not been successful for many years. The relative lull after the successful and truly epic ""Ben Hur"" and ""Spartacus"", which lasted as much as forty years, decided to interrupt his film Ridley Scott. The risk was great, because it was quite difficult to return the viewer and ""resurrect"" an already forgotten and not so popular genre.Having examples of all the epic films shot before, the authors of the picture were going to show the ancient empire not from the point of view of the image of the ancient Romans or Greeks, since the presentation of such stories seems not so much impossible, but simply not quite interesting. The story of the emperor, the conspiracies and intrigues in the senate, the corruption that destroys Rome, is not as interesting to the viewer as the more dynamic and better perceived story of the hero. A story in which the recreated world of antiquity becomes in fact a huge and incredibly beautiful setting for the story of a difficult life and the fate of a person.However, the balance between a serious film, where the actors ' performance is crucial, and a fantastic performance with grandiose and vivid shooting, is sometimes very difficult to find. Ridley Scott skillfully and professionally copes with the task, overcoming all difficulties and creating a new large-scale and beautiful world, without forgetting its plot and theme.",Gladiator
2044,gfe-94749,A movie worthy of a thousand and one praises!,10,9 June 2021,"Watching 'Gladiator' for the first time, I naturally set myself up for a pleasant time. The movie justified itself by all 200%, I got full pleasure from what I watched!And now in order:What can I hide - I generally love historical films, where there are some legends of missionaries, well, or just the ancient world, which I know only from books and documentaries. 'Gladiator' is a combination of all the best that could be found.Russell Crowe - absolutely accurate hit in the image. His appearance is how I imagined a warrior of those ancient times: strong, courageous in every movement, showing no pain, no fear. Only such people become Generals, followed by thousands of people. And as a result, the authorities are terribly afraid of such people.Joaquin Phoenix-a representative of the acting dynasty could not be better played a bloodthirsty and vindictive emperor, who seized the throne by killing his father. All his life he hated Maximus, as his father allegedly loved him more (Maximus).I was particularly impressed by the moment when the emperor (Joaquin Phoenix) went down to the stadium, asked the name of the warrior (Crowe) and he told him his full name in response! It gave me the creeps...I think 'Gladiator' is one of the best films of the early 21st century!",Gladiator
2045,scustoms,Gladiator,10,12 December 2006,Gladiator is one of the coolest movies ever. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a true thriller with lots of blood and gore. I give the movie a 10 because it kept me on the edge of my seat during the entire motion picture. The movie was full of suspense. My favorite part of the movie is when Maximus told the emperor his true identity; it was hardcore.One of the things I didn't like was there was a bunch of goofs such as when they say they knew the true identity of Maximus before they were supposed to. I would definitely recommend this movie to all ages and I can't wait to watch it again.,Gladiator

This movie has everything -- Action, Drama, Politics, History and Romance (but not too much of it which is good). The action sequences are superb, both the battle scene and the fighting scene. Every details are captured tastefully, & not too gory. The acting is always superb. Russell Crowe was such a natural. I love him!! and his character, Maximus. I'm so glad he won an Oscar which he rightfully deserved. At last not least, the soundtrack was so great that it sounds good just by itself (I still listen to it everyday!!). Also I should not forget to mention the special effect like the reconstruction of the ancient Rome and the Colosseum. I felt like looking at a real living city as it was New York or London or something. After I watched Gladiator, I also watched Ben Hur just to satisfy my thirst for blood. But nah, Ben Hur is not even half as good as Gladiator.",Gladiator
2050,speedy_hr,This is the best movie I ever see! My number 1!!,10,21 February 2007,"A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do. And in the opulently rousing Gladiator that goes doubly for Maximus (Russell Crowe), the classic hero personified. A great Roman general, he isn't insulated from the same skulduggery and inconsiderations that plague executives in today's corporate scene. You know the drill: The top man, in this case Emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris), loves you like a son. He's grooming you to take his spot. Only you can continue his glorious vision for the company. And then your benefactor meets an untimely demise. Suddenly no one knows anything about what the boss had in mind for you. Especially his corrupt son, who it just so happens was being cut out of the loop prior to dear old Dad's suspicious death.But despair not, fans of the Roman Empire, the business world, or politics in general. Per director Ridley Scott's lavish throwback to the sword and sandal epics of the 1950s, talent and greatness will out. It is the romantically optimistic contention of screenwriters David H. Franzoni, John Logan and William Nicholson that ideas, like honour and devotion, are as indestructible as matter; that they live on in reincarnated forms.Of course it was a little more complicated in 180AD. Whereas today's ousted golden boy in search of vindication might simply take his resume and a few company secrets cross-town, the fugitive Maximus' road to redemption first leads him into slavery. And then adhering to good Biblical/literary form, it is not until he hits absolute rock bottom that the heroic paradigm reinvents himself as a peerless gladiator, beloved by the masses and primed to challenge Aurelius' despotic son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix).It's a grand old tale, and apparently ready for the retelling thanks to Mr. Scott's fine helmsmanship, Russell Crowe's stupendous tour-de-force in the title role, and the relatively economical set possibilities now afforded via computer magic. While you can expect Mr. Crowe (L.A. Confidential, The Insider) to garner another Oscar nomination, the rub-your-eyes-in-disbelief effects that virtually re-create Rome at the height of her glory are also award-worthy.The other active ingredient in director Scott's sweeping tale of love, duty, deceit and revenge is testosterone. An opening battle scene depicting the Roman Legion's vicious campaign in Germania to win the last of the undefeated lands worth conquering is a naturalistic horror -- as primitively haunting in its anti-war message as the first twenty minutes of Spielberg's Normandy invasion in Saving Private Ryan. This is smartly balanced by a corresponding tale of intrigue at court featuring the internecine calculations of the deliciously twisted Commodus and his far more politically astute sister, Lucilla, exacted with notable aplomb by the comely Connie Nielsen.Curiously subtle hints at incest as well as a far nobler tale of unrequited love round out the story. And perhaps just for good measure, conjuring images of de Havilland, O'Hara, Fairbanks and Flynn, the filmmakers can't pass up the time-honoured cliché wherein highborn damsel visits seemingly doomed hunk in the dungeon. Will she slip him a file along with the forbidden kiss? In any case, even when combined with the script's glibly knowing takes on senatorial politics, the cerebral aspects of this cinematic event are far outweighed by the visceral.Mr. Crowe oozes with authority as the consummate warrior-leader, with men just dying, literally, to follow him to Elysium. A less egalitarian film critic, unconcerned with being labelled a chauvinist, might even dub Gladiator a men's film; albeit one that can still be enjoyed by the women who love them.The fighting is, to coin a phrase, awesome, featuring more decapitations and high-pressure blood spurts than a slice-and-dice flick. Maybe even more than on those ""real-life"" emergency room shows you inevitably come across when channel surfing. Be assured, 'tis the free-flowing plasma and not sex that earns it an R-rating.A fine supporting cast keeps the action from sprawling out of control and the story from being engulfed by the stunning special effects. Joaquin Phoenix is appropriately hateful and completely without redeeming qualities as the warped Commodus. Oliver Reed, who sadly died during filming on Malta, adds a sympathetically reflective note as Proximus, once a great gladiator and now a self-effacing promoter of combative flesh. Derek Jacobi is correctly aristocratic as Gracchus, the Roman senator who forthrightly declares: ""I may not be of the people, but I certainly am for the people."" And even Richard Harris manages to harness the hamminess, succinctly setting the film's philosophically sober tone as Emperor Marcus Aurelius. Naturally, in a respectful nod to Hollywood tradition, ancient Romans still speak with a proper British accent.Truth be told, the architectural evocation of the legendary city is a bit much, a tad too perfect. Which tends to remind that it's all being done by a little computer. But then again, much of this splashing saga has to be exaggerated. If it weren't, the stirring political lesson, every bit as poignant as the message in Braveheart, would just get buried in the sand. Constructing an homage to the film phylum that is Rome while providing viably exciting entertainment not only for seasoned viewers, but for an entire generation that probably never saw Ben-Hur, director Ridley Scott achieves just the right balance of the old and the new. True, all roads no longer lead to Rome. But rest assured that once the word gets around, filmgoers in search of big-screen thrills will beat a path to Gladiator",Gladiator
2051,ichbinsofrei,Slightly disappointing and somewhat hard to endure for historical educated people,6,1 March 2007,"Gladiator promised to be the precursor of a new generation of historical movies. Therefore expectations were high. Special effects in the movie business reached a level where the realisation of every story themed possible. Saving Private Ryan gave a good impression of how the new historical movies could look like: gigantic, fast and dirty. Gladiator had all that and it lacked everything else. The movie was a pain to watch for every historian. It featured wrong written Latin and wrong Roman names, weapons and armour from an era of more than one millennium, even some very futuristic items like the praetorian uniforms and Maximus' helmet, and a confused presentation of the Roman behaviour. All this could have been avoided easily by simply consulting the engaged historian who refused to be mentioned in the credits due to all the mentioned mistakes. Historical people appeared but were almost impossible to recognize. The Germanic warriors looked like cavemen, but were in fact entirely Romanised by this time, the mistrust of Marcus Aurelius in his own son was incomprehensible as was his desire to reestablish the republic and Commodus is simplified to the stereotypical Roman tyrant he has never been. The story was more than common. It was a conglomeration of well known Hollywood stories featuring betrayal, violence and an upcoming underdog. And finally the movie avoided profundity. The characters were clichés, Commodus for example was the stereotyped tyrant, who is dastard, cruel and commits incest. Every aspect was divided in black and white extremes - the muddy and dark Germania versus the clean and shiny Rome, the true and honourable legionnaire forces versus the corrupt and hypocritical Roman politicians, the honest and brave Maximus versus the craven and week Commodus. And all the stereotypes of the Roman Empire were reproduced. The film featured a powerless senate, a nasty emperor, a brave gladiator, conquering Roman legionnaires, fierce barbarians, a woman in the background and the end of a regency. By trying to combine all these features in one movie the movie itself looses its plausibility.If you can ignore all that you will find Gladiator a simple but entertaining movie to lighten a boring afternoon.",Gladiator

Russell Crowe has pulled off better performances than his portrayal of Macho Maximus.  The plot still doesn't satisfy me because you never become completely attached to Maximus.

The way the director Ridley Scott recreated Rome and its military and political struggle was a masterpiece, from the language used to the accuracy of the structures it was almost as if it really was still there to see.The way the characters like Maximus (Russell Crowe) fit in to the character was phenomenal the performance gave the audience the real feeling of being a general who was betrayed, then became a gladiator and obtained his revenge. Definitely a gladiator who defied and emperor is the best way to describe how he executed his role, even cast who aren't famous Hollywood material managed to keep the audience on the edge of their seats and showed them the a replica of Rome.

But I would like to say one thing. Those of you who think this is the 'greatest movie of all time' are really clueless as to what else there is out there.  Gladiator seemed amazing to me too after the first time I saw it.  But after the 2nd or 3rd viewing, the only thing it had going for it were the action sequences(which were shot very confusingly, nice job Ridley).Anyway, I'll close by saying it didn't even deserve to be nominated for Best Picture, much less win.

His eyes tell the story in every take he's in. So many times he says something that everyone around him takes in a normal context. But the audience can tell through his eyes his every thought and motivation. The only character who could possibly have been even better was Phoenix's Commodus. He is not like that in real life, but to become such whiny, bratty, & jealous character (to the level that Commodus is) and make it believable is incredible.It was so interesting following every character's motivation and perspective.

The only fact I dislike is that the story presented in the movie it is not real, even if the movie is considered to be an historical one. There are some facts that really annoyed me: the battle presented in the beginning of the film takes place in Germania,but a country with this name didn't exist. ""Germania"" presented in the movie was a land of barbarians,not a kingdom or empire.

2064,zgizme,Ineffable...,10,9 November 2007,"Gladiator is a movie about ""the general who became a slave, the slave who became a gladiator, and the gladiator who defied an emperor"". Immediately after watching the opening scene of Gladiator, in which Maximus leads his great army numbering over 1000 to victory over Germania, I was sure the experience would be rewarding. Richard Crowe, who plays Maximus in the movie, is a great Roman general under the rule of Marcus Aurelius Caesar (Harris). However, Aurelius soon leaves the throne to his Maximus, or at least he wished so. Wishing to bestow his title onto Maximus, Commodus, who is the son of Aurelius, murders him and claims his title as emperor. He sends Maximus into exile and sentences him and his family to death. Following this scene, I was advised to hold on to the edge of my seat, and so I pass on the advice.After his sentence, Maximus rushes to Spain in an effort to save his family, but alas. Hung by nooses from the vines of the trees surrounding his home, his wife and son disappear, and so does his will to live. This sudden loss makes him an easy target for slavers roaming the countryside, and so begins his life as a gladiator. Loved by the people and his fellow troops, he plays the image of the hero perfectly in this riveting film. Maximus's true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed, and the actions of Commodus in his cruel efforts to destroy Maximus once and for all are halted in the end, and what an unforgettable ending it is. The music and scene quality contribute immensely to the mood, which is perfectly played by Crowe and allows the movie's tone and general feel to reverberate in your bones long after watching it thanks to the incredible ending. The amazing cinematography further heightens its level on the greater scale when compared to other movies of its kind. I'm only stating a fact when I say that as far as everything from acting and directing to the storyline and special effects go, this movie is SPECTACULAR. It's certainly very moving and emotionally satisfying. I'd recommend it any day to those who haven't seen it. Personally, six times hasn't been enough for me, as this is a movie you can't get tired of seeing. Enjoy :)",Gladiator

Any student of high school in Italy would be a sufficient historical consultant to the writers of the screenplay.

The seats chosen for the spectators in the Colosseum and generally speaking in Roman Arenas were precisely assigned. Lower levels, i.e. first ""gradins"" were exclusively reserved to Senators and important citizens of Rome, such as magistrateships. In the movie such rule is completely ignored. The intermediate levels, above, were for other citizens and the main part of male spectators. Finally women were segregated in the highest and separated levels of the Anphitheater. No mixed men/women audience were allowed! Moreover no mixed fight with beasts and other fighters ever took place. At noon the show was concerned with fights with or against wild beasts.

The main protagonist can easily be related to, you root for him and want him to win. A true movie hero, and Russel Crowe's renown range of expressions and emotions make it a solid performance. Also, Joaquin Pheonix's role as the delusional and insane emperor is a perfect foil to Crowe's good-natured Maximus. As for the action, brutal and smooth throughout the movie, it never overstays its welcome. This is not a movie, its cinema.

Aside from the incredible photography, the intensity of the meld between storyboarding incredible angles and images that created such a sumptuous visual feast, and impeccable acting by a fine and long to be remembered cast... what stands out Most about this film are two things...The betrayal of devotion and Russell Crowe as Maximus whose will to decency and sense of honor made him a victim of the times he lived in. Good God almighty....there are few actors these days that could have brought this kind of raw masculinity to such resonance on the screen....but it is not just this that makes Crowe shine but his incredibly sensitive portrayal of Maximus as a man of the sword by his sense of duty, but a man of the soil in his heart. Crowes physicality and ability to translate Maximus to the screen is a performance worthy of an academy award...but it is Maximus who steals the show!!! His heart,his strength, his determination,his unfailing love for his family, his need for justice,...his Values are the Star of this film. He reminds me of Cyrano DE Bergerac in many ways....and I can give him no better accolade than that. There are so few role models for this age....characters like Maximus are what civilization is all about. He lived up to the heritage and meaning of his name...there is no more...there is no better...than to strive for decency, to uphold honor,to value family, to recognise duty to high ideals, to love the earth,to defend civilization at its best, and oppose tyranny,to cherish life...other lives as well as your own. Maximus was a product of his time, an honored soldier ultimately betrayed. This betrayal cost him the values he lived by for a while to pursue survival...ultimately his values were the victors...and it is they that made him a Hero. Ridley Scott has given the big screen some of its most important and enduring images from Blade Runner to Alien..on and on...he continues to amaze with his ingeniuty at getting his vision transfixed in our minds...no less so here...his use of digital imagery to create Rome and the Colloseum alive with spectators is riveting. Joachin Phoenix is a wonderfully tormented Commodus with his deep and unrequited cravings for love and approval from his sister and his father to his vicious malevolance towards Maximus...what a contrast. He is showing talent far beyond the youth of his years. And the appearance of several of my personal favorites added all the extra spice to a film I was already in love with from the first battle scenes in Germania. These additional screen luminaries and legends were Richard Harris, duly sincere and remorseful as Marcus Aurelius, Derek Jacoby as a Senator hopeful of a new Rome,and the wonderful Oliver Reed, in his last role,as an ex-Gladiator turned provider of human fodder for THE GAMES. WOW!!!This is a film NOT to be missed,and the story of a man to be remembered!!!",Gladiator
2073,sambox1,Echoes in Eternity...,10,29 January 2009,"When I first watched this movie I had never before seen any of Ridley Scott's or Russell Crowe's work. After having seen it I tried to familiarize myself with all of their work, but none have matched the caliber of this film.One of the greater points of this film is its acting. Crowe brings us this broken man with nothing to live for but revenge, but who comes to understand that he must fight (and fight he shall) for something much more than personal glory. Joaquin Phoenix brings us a tormented emperor who after feeling betrayed by his father, and who trys to find the love he failed to find from his father in the Roman crowds. In his final film role, Oliver Reed plays a former gladiator who tries to catch some of the glory that basks of his trainees, in an effort to reclaim the feeling of winning the crowd.But in my opinion, the films highest point is in its score. Hans Zimmer composes a score for the ages that fits perfectly with every scene, whether it is Maximus riding into battle, Commodus scheming against the senate, or the unforggetable climax.In short: Gladiator is a masterpiece. It is an instant classic, a tearjerker, a thrill, and any other adjective noun that can be thought of, an easily deserving of any award it should receive.",Gladiator
2074,mournful-maniac,Nice!,9,29 May 2020,"Gladiator is a historical epic from director Ridley Scott. After being betrayed by the new Caesar, Roman general Maximus is sold into slavery as a gladiator where he rises to fame as a people's champion and finds an opportunity to exact his revenge. Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, and Connie Nielsen lead the cast and deliver strong performances. Additionally, the gladiator fights are especially dynamic and exciting, featuring several different styles of combat. The costumes and sets are also remarkably well-done, and create a vivid depiction of ancient Rome. And, Hans Zimmer's score does an excellent job at capturing the tone of the film. Thrilling and action-packed, Gladiator delivers a compelling tale. ""Are you not entertained?!",Gladiator

I bet they already have. Overall this is a fantastic movie. Let 11+ watch it. C'Mon parents. It is not nearly as bad as any new action adventure movie.

The music is without doubt the nearest thing I have ever heard to how I felt watching this- If movies such as The Dark Knight can get top 10- this should be n.2-5 however, I believe definitely top 20- as neither batman not any epic i have seen in the last 10 years has given the same feeling by the end of the film.I watched it in the cinema- ther was a short 10second silence at the end- and then everyone got up to applaud.",Gladiator

Where ""Gladiator"" delivers is in the area of raw human emotions we are so familiar with.As somebody said, switching to the other mind-set is half the fun, and Gladiator takes you right to the midst of Romans' politics, their passions, their dreams and their weaknesses.After Ben-Hur, I feel this is the best period movie to have ever emerged from Hollywood.-Murali Chari",Gladiator

2083,johnpbuckner1,A real stinker of a movie,1,21 December 2009,"I am an off and on student of Roman history. While viewing this movie again recently it struck me that almost every ""fact"" about the Roman Empire that this film introduces is wrong. I counted no fewer than 17 huge inaccuracies in the opening fight scene. These are important inaccuracies too, such as the cavalry charge through the woods. Try that yourself sometime and see how long it takes for you to end up with a branch in your teeth. Also, the general leaving the army to go lead a minor cavalry charge and the catapults and ballistae being used were glaringly inaccurate as well. I could go on and on just about the opening scene but the theme continues throughout the movie with inaccuracies piled on top of each other.The bottom line is, this movie only has the vaguest resemblance to the historical Rome. Once you remove the historical distortions you are left with nothing but a cheesy movie with bad dialogue. Whoever wrote this should have spent some time reading a book or two about Rome.",Gladiator

You will shed tears, cry and ""be there with Maximus"" to claim his revenge. The color variations through the scenes will give you back exactly the atmosphere you need in this movie. Characters are carefully selected and they perform well, starting with Commodus, Lucilla and Maximus. The side characters perform well, no doubt about that.

It is about a Roman General (Maximus) who is betrayed and his wife and child are murdered. After he has been betrayed he is sent to be executed but escapes and is captured by slave traders. He is sold and then is trained as a gladiator. The man who betrayed him is now the emperor of Rome and Maximus wants to win his freedom and get revenge. It won 5 Oscars for Best Actor, Best costume design, Best effects/visual effects,best picture and best sound. You should not pass the chance to see this movie.

2087,smerta13,Great Movie! http://my.ilstu.edu/~mmsmerz/smerta/,10,21 May 2010,"Gladiator is one of the greatest films that have ever been created. Russell Crowe and Juaquin Phoenix emit pure hate for one another. The emotions are so real and strong but are never over done.Maximus Decimus Meridias is a character that I will never forget. He is an honorable man, but put him in the right situation and he becomes a confident bad ass. When he is in the coliseum and is confronted by Caesar, I always get goose bumps. That scene drips with dramatic irony. Caesar has no idea that it is Maximus standing before him. One of my favorite quotes is uttered in this scene. And every time I see it I am totally convinced that Maximus ""will get his vengeance, in this life or the next."" Juaquin Phoenix as Caesar was a great villain. He was a whiny, conniving, childish, and above all evil man. When he tells Maximus about the murders of his family I was so disgusted with him. I hated him. That is how you know how good the villain is – by how much you hate them. http://my.ilstu.edu/~mmsmerz/smerta/",Gladiator

Heroic story, which makes us believe that we can change something. Full completed story line, amazing actors = you got to see this ""Masterpiece"". I think that Russell Crowe made Maximus character legend - the man who believes in glorious Rome and has no fear for death. Every man wants to take a step forward and leave the mark of his existence, that is why Maximus is so likable - true hero. For me, the most interesting thing was how the director will show roman soldiers - and he did it well. Also it is interesting to watch how politicians work against each other. It is hard to say why I like it so much. I think, because it is fully accomplished. Vibes is essential thing for me watching this film. And I can do it again, and again, and again.",Gladiator

2091,bradyworkman1113,"An amazing thriller full of love, deception and violence",9,22 January 2011,"Gladiator is one of my favorite movies of all time because it has a very rich plot that leaves you on the edge of your seat through the entire movie, curious what is going to happen. The plot of this movie is not the only thing that makes this movie very intense and rich, the acting also contributed to this very realistic feel. I felt that the casting of the parts was done very well because there were very few if any actors who were weaker links. This is a movie of love, death, and deception and a sort of twisted plot in which a Roman general Maximus is betrayed and is enslaved as a gladiator. There are many intense battles throughout this movie that are very gory but still look very real. These battle scenes were very realistic and left me enthralled and it was hard for me to believe that I wasn't really in Rome as this battle was going on. Russell Crow's playing as Maximus was by far my favorite role because it seemed as if he was really feeling the emotions he would be feeling if he were really in the situations. I'm not going to give away anymore of the movie than that because I think that it is a movie that everyone should watch and find out for themselves because it is truly an amazing movie which I would recommend to anyone who doesn't mind a little blood and gore.",Gladiator

Gladiator features some wonderful cinematography by John Mathieson. The battle scenes are very graphic. There were some scenes in particular that really struck me, such as when Crowe appears to be floating over the ground very fast. The use of color and color tones added a great deal to the mood of the movie. Ridley Scott's epic film does not romanticize a democratic Golden Age of Rome but a decaying, blood thirsty empire on the edge of its fall...

2097,simon_jarvis,Boriiiiiing!!!,1,2 November 2003,"Even though 'Gladiator' won so many awards and received so many good comments I still believe that the movie was extremely boring!!Ok, let's take things from the beginning. The movie starts out with an energetic battle full of great effects of vivid action that fascinates everyone. But that's the end of the movie for me. The fascination is over. There's nothing more to watch, as in the rest of the film we just have to withstand the blabbering and chaffering of Maximus, Marcus Aurelius, Comudus, Lucilla and the others. All their discussions are so unnecessary and make the film so boring that it's better to just go out of the cinema and return only when the other powerful scene begins- Maximus as a gladiator. 'Gladiator' was created just to impress critics who love history. To the rest of the audience it's just there to offer nothing more than cool visual effects and boredom. I watched the movie twice just to make sure that it was complete rubbish and both times I tried hard not to fall asleep and both times I did not manage! Crowe's performance was not as good as in 'A Beautiful Mind' and did not deserve the oscar. Joaquin Phoenix was alright, but nothing fantastic. Gladiator had a boring plot with a story that was seen in the past so many times and it's time to move away from the revenge and comeback stuff.I would not suggest this movie to anyone and I was taken aback when I saw so many people adoring it. I wondered why there's so much bad taste in people.Gladiator 3/10",Gladiator

Since the setting takes place in Rome it is captivating that terrific lines and speeches be involved and this movie showed how that works and blends with the acting by Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and Connie Nelson. This movie is one the best because through out the film, the mood of the of the story is maintained just like the mood is maintained in Million Dollar baby and it doesn't slip.

I really enjoyed the movie at the beginning when i first saw it, however it took a couple of years and an interesting lecture on movies and society, to finally realise that this movie that i liked so much since i was little wasn't so roman at all. It is obvious but you never truly come to think about it. The man, war hero, victim and warrior falling in love with the woman who is spoken for. And the woman obviously falls in love with the hero.

2105,sidchild,Review for CompII class,10,31 January 2012,"Gladiator is one of the greatest movies of all time. From the plot to the way it was shot. It is one of the only rated R movies that I would recommend to a middle schooler or high schooler. the only reason it is really rated R is for its violence and gore. There isn't any inappropriate sex scenes or foul language. The movies plot is about a man named Maximus that was a leader of the Roman army and double crossed by the emperor's son who later became the Emperor of Rome. The anger and Hate Maximus has for his enemy fuels him through may epic battles in the arena. The character Maximus played by Russell Crowe is played perfectly. His look and the way Russell portrays his hate sells the whole movie for me. The way the movie was shot from the CGI Coliseum to the costumes worn gave the movie a realistic feel. The dramatic angles and editing made the fight scenes second to none in this movies genre. Gladiator is a movie that will be timeless. No doubt in my mind my children and their children will still be watching this movie. The awards this movie won could speak for themselves, but i recommend that you find out for yourself how great this movie is. I rate this movie 10 out of 10.",Gladiator

It simply has it all and is close to perfection in all the areas that count.A solid revenge tale, with a larger than life hero to root for and a despicable villain to hate. Excellent pacing - at two and a half hours, it never begins to drag. Phenomenal acting across the board. A great script full of memorable quotes and rousing speeches (ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!). One of the greatest scores from one of the best film composers. Plenty of action, from the opening battle to the smaller scale (yet equally intense) gladiatorial combat.

This truly is a spectacle to behold! Russell Crowe delivers the performance of an outstanding career. He manages to captivate not only the crowd of the Coloseum but also those watching at home, cheering on and watching intently on the edges of their seats. Jouaqin Phoenix makes you truly hate him and sympathize with him all at once, and Oliver Reed as Proximo; the gladiator set free who turns to owning and training his own set of gladiators. Oliver Reed delivers exactly what you would expect and you receive exactly what you want from him.Lisa Gerrard and Hans Zimmer deliver an essential soundtrack to accompany the film. Epic in proportion the original scores also aim to rend tears and jerk emotions straight from the crowd.Released in 2000, Gladiator stands to be one of the most atmospheric and truly magnificent films I have seen.

Loyal to all and protector of the weak. Honor and strength flow from him into all about him including the viewer. The supporting cast rises up to meet Crowe's magnificent performance. Cameo players could be nominated for acting finest awards. The sheer magnitude of each scene will fill all your senses with wonder and awe.

2112,evelyn-perry1,Good!,8,11 July 2017,"Like Ben-Hur, this is a story of a successful man who loses everything thanks to an evil man, and then has to fight his way back up to seek revenge on that man and to obtain his freedom back. It's a tried-and-true formula. This movie doesn't go to excess on the violence as some of the other more recent epic films did, such as ""Braveheart"" or ""The Patriot.""The acting is excellent, beginning with Russell Crowe, who has established himself as one of the best actors of today. Joaquin Phoenix also put himself ""on the map"" as an actor with his portrayal of the evil ""Commodus."" He's so annoying you want to slap that sucker, which means he's doing a good job acting.

I guarantee you wont be disappointed.The music was great as well. I suppose the only failing the movie has is that there is no sequel. I find that Russel is always great in these roles and I would like to see more of him.If I had to give this film an exact rating, I would rate it 8.47, or due to the awesomeness of this film, 847 out of 1000!!",Gladiator
2114,joshformanek,Gladiator and its vision through Maximus,10,2 May 2012,"First of all, I want to start off by saying that this is a fantastic movie. The actors and the production crew did a great job at portraying each characters emotions and struggles. The plot is also very well written as it draws the audience into its midst and captures everyones attention. One thing that I want to focus on is the character Maximus. Obviously being the main character, Maximus is the star of the movie. He is for one, courageous and strong, never giving up and always fighting for his freedom. He is also a respectful and very humble man. He never shows disrespect to those above him and he never brags about his strength and power. In a quote from the movie he is asked what he is saying to his family who is in the afterlife. He states, ""To my son - I tell him I will see him again soon. To keep his heels down while riding his horse. To my wife... that is not your business."" With a sense of humor he respects his family and remains pure at most. Maximus also never gives up. He understands that he has to keep fighting to stay alive. Anything less and he is a dead man. In explaining this to another character he says, ""I am required to kill, so I kill. That is enough."" Wow. He does it because he has to. If he didn't have to, he probably wouldn't harm a fly. He seems to be the most kind and considerate person, but on the other side of things, understands what is necessary to stay alive. One of my favorite lines from the movie is this, ""What we do in life echoes in eternity."" While not all of us in this world believe in life after death, there is truth and meaning to this for us who do believe. Maximus has has faith in something far more greater then what is here on earth. I love how the movie is constantly showing how Maximus is looking towards the afterlife. When things get tough and there seems to be know way out, this thought of the afterlife, keeps him going. Maximus understands that there is something greater, and he will one day be able to reunite with his family which he loves greatly. I also love the character that Maximus plays because he is constantly keeping one eye on eternity. In the old testament of the Bible, Ecclesiastes 3, verse 11 says that, ""He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end."" What a great reminder that this life isn't all that there is. There is more to live for then living a good life, having a good job, and making lots of money. I am not only saying that these things are not important, but they shouldn't control us. What is also very neat in this movie is that the glimpses of the after life are not fully visible. They are not completely clear as to what is happening in these scenes but it is obvious that these scenes of the afterlife are way better then the times during this movie. These glimpses are not completely seen; but we know they seem to be full of life and satisfying. In 2nd Corinthians, the writer says, ""So we fix our eyes not on what is seen, but on what is unseen, since what is seen is temporary, but what is unseen is eternal."" What is unseen is eternal. We don't think like that everyday. But we should.Way to go for this film becoming a top favorite movie for many people. But even cooler, intentionally or not, how it uses its main character to highlight on greater things to come.",Gladiator
2115,cmortimer362,"Worst ""historical"" movie ever",3,14 July 2012,"I remember watching this film when I was maybe 12, and I loved it. Now, 8 years later, I rewatched it (extended edition) and realised how awful this movie really is. I hope I'm not nitpicking, because it felt to me that the points I am going to make were there just to insult the viewers intelligence. -First major battle scene. Romans have siege weapons just lying around, on the front line of Germania? They are obviously hard to transport, and there is no reason for them to be there. -Crowe says later that there were roughly 10,000 roman soldiers on the battlefield, with 2,000 dead. Thats funny because I could probably count the number of roman soldiers who were shown to have died on 1 hand, whereas the number of barbarians killed was massive. -Crowe says the casualties sustained by the cavalry by the siege weapons were necessary, then does nothing but complain about how many of his men died. -Russell Crowe sneaks out of the fort with his cavalry and somehow manages to encircle thousands of barbarians, without them ever noticing. Also, the barbarians just stand there and allow this to happen. -The choice of softly spoken British accents for the romans was awful. I'm not saying they should of spoken in full Latin, but that is no reason for them to speak in those annoying accents. -After the battle, the emperor, the emperors son and his daughter are all within maybe a days ride of the Germanian front line? That makes no sense, why would such important figures be there at all? -Crowe is described as Rome's best general by Caesar, yet he is Spanish, lives on a farm and has no involvement in politics. -Caesar says he is close to death, yet he journeyed from Rome presumably to the front line of Germania. Why didn't he stay in Rome? -Caesar bestows Crowe with the title of Protector of Rome, a man who is Spanish, has little interest or skill in politics and wants nothing more than to go home. Good choice Caesar. -Crowe's slave(he's never called a slave) has a Scottish accent. Is this a nod to the Eagle of the Ninth? Simple stealing of idea because they thought it would work in the Roman context? Or just bad historical accuracy? Also, they are in Germania, so why would there be a Scottish slave there? There isn't any mention of Crowe serving in Britannia. -I can understand Crowe being depicted as an indestructible badass, but seriously, the dude can throw swords that accurately? -Crowe somehow manages to ride from the front line in Germania(which kind of suggests deep in Germania), to Spain, just in time to just miss his wife and son's murderers? Impossible. The farm was still smoking when he got there for god's sake. -After that funny scene where he's covered in snot after finding his wife and son, he's picked up by apparently African slave traders (Carthaginians?). A roman citizen, in a roman province, abducted by slave traders? I don't think I need to explain myself anymore. -So Crowe apparently has an SPQR tattoo, something never practised by Romans at all. The only people who would tattoo themselves were barbarians. So I got 45 minutes in than I gave up. I'll probably get a lot of stick for this review, but I really don't care. If you are looking for a good historically accurate movie with a plot that makes sense I cannot stress enough how frustrated you will be watching this movie. If you have no knowledge of the Roman civilization at all and you are willing to look past all the glaring plot holes and bad accents, there is a lot you will enjoy about this movie. It is full of action and Crowe is a badass. The reason I didn't give this 1 out of 10 is because there were a few enjoyable battle/fight scenes where you could forget about all the stupidness that had occurred for a few minutes. Other than that, there is nothing stopping this from being one of the worst movies I have ever seen.",Gladiator

When Emperor Marcus Aurelius' son Commodus murders his father, he must also do away with Maximus Decimus Meridius, the finest general.

There is nothing about this movie I didn't like and I am an avid movie goer.

2118,gunslinger-ocelot,One of the all time best,9,20 May 2017,"""The Gladiator"" follows the story of Maximus Decimus Meridius, a fictional General in the Roman army set during the historical era of Marcus Aurelius' reign as Emperor of the Roman Empire. It's important to remember when watching this film that it's not historically accurate but rather a sort of ""fan fiction"" What makes this movie so great for me is the broad spectrum of narratives in the film itself. Ranging everything from love, friendship and heroism to hate, jealousy and vengeance. Gladiator is often cited as one of Ridley Scotts best films and rightly so as both the screenplay and cinematography are an amazing feat. It also feature one of the most iconic scores in cinema history, with brilliant work from Hans Zimmer.Though this film isn't perfect(but then again what film ever is) and has many flaws it's not hard to find it has elements that even the best director fail at done exceptionally well, which is why it resonates with so many viewers. Its often critiqued as being massively overrated mostly by people with expectations set unrealistically high, who pick apart only whats wrong with the film and give no credit where its due, like for instance the casting of Russel Crowe to play the character of Maximus, who suited the role so well that its arguably the crowing achievement of his career because of the type of character he plays really plays well to Crowes brooding acting style.If you're looking for a timeless classic with great effects, exceptional cast and acting talent and brilliant story line (with one of the best endings in cinema history) then look no further.(My review for this film comes from a motivation to write a review to get the tick on the my account section on IMDb and the fact that after years of deliberation I've chosen this film as my all time favorite film.)",Gladiator
2119,acedecade5,The first epic of the 21st century is without a doubt Ridley Scott's finest cinematic achievement.,10,12 November 2012,"As a die hard movie fan, I believe movie reviews are all about personal opinion, so I'll start off by saying my personal opinion is Ridley Scott's Gladiator is the greatest film I've ever seen. I'm sure there are a lot of sci-fi nerds out there who will argue that Alien or Blade Runner is Scott's best work, but those films lack the heart that Gladiator has. From the films intense opening to the awesome Battle of Carthage, this movie captivated me like no film I have ever seen before. Of course, the performances in Gladiator are one of the main reasons why this movie is so great. Russell Crowe is excellent as Maximus, the Roman General turned slave earned him a well deserved Best Actor Oscar. A special shout out goes to Joaquin Phoenix. Few actors have the ability to truly make u loathe them in a movie, but Phoenix's portrayal as the young Emperor Commodus is so conniving and evil it's pure genius, although this wasn't Phoenix's first movie, to me this role was his breakout performance and I thought he was snubbed at the Oscars that year. This film has it all, brilliant acting, great cinematography, and intense battle scenes. My hats off to Ridley Scott for creating this cinematic masterpiece.""What we do in life, echoes in eternity"" -Maximus",Gladiator
2120,onlyhisgrace,A must-see,9,17 November 2012,"Gladiator. Everyone would expect gore, the games, and power lust. However, there is much more to this movie. We see Maximus's journey from general to slave to gladiator to rebel against the emperor. Ridley Scott's Gladiator was a great portrayal of what was acceptable in the Roman's time. from the way the set was displayed to the actors that were casted just added to the movie. Joaquin Phoenix's acting was incredible in his role of Commodus. Russel Crowe as Maximus was able to give a look into a gladiator's struggle, and yet Crowe did in a way so elegantly. The plot made viewers able to relate to the story through the themes of love, family, and revenge. The character's dialogue was written in away that it was modern, but still held the romance language it once was. I would definitely recommend this movie to any mature audience; overall, it is a must-see!",Gladiator

2122,Beatlekid1800,One of the best,8,10 August 2005,"There's no such thing as a perfect movie and i don't think that Gladiator is even near that. But this movie takes a could be basic 80's style action film (like mad max or any steven segal movie)and turns it into a cinematic masterpiece. Ridley Scott is known to make C class concepts into A style movies (Blade Runner) and knows what he's doing and how. the Cinematography is perfect and this is a film for almost everyone to enjoy. If you like rich dialog and cinematography, then this is your film. If you like action and intense war scene, then this is your film. Joaquin Phoenix steals ever scene he is in as he plays the Empire son, who becomes Empire himself. Russell Crowe as much as everyone hate always gives his greatest performance ever (even though he is very good in L.A. confidential). Oliver Reed (Goodfellas) also gives a humorous but heartfelt performance as Maximus' owner who was once a Gladiator himself, this would also mark the last Oliver Reed film unfortunately as he died after filming. Dijmon Hounsou (Amastad, In America) also did a good job as well, surprised me for the most as he was only a model prior to this. But this movie overall isn't the best i have seen, but it should be recognized as one of the best. If you haven't seen this movie go and rent it, you won't be disappointed. 8 out 10",Gladiator

The story has a historic ground, Marco Aurelio and Comodo's reigns, but also it has an human story of revenge and courage. This film may be the best historic film in the last years.

2128,MrJenssen,The General Who became A Slave - The Slave Who Became A Gladiator - The Gladiator Who Challenged An Empire...,7,13 February 2005,"I remember the first time I watched this movie on TV, at my friend's place. He was all like ""Aw man! You gotta see the action scenes!"". So I went over to his place and watched it. We watched the battle in the start, and then he was all over the fast forward-button until we came to the scenes in the arenas. So I didn't quite know what this movie was all about, and at that time I hadn't heard of Russel Crowe before (Hey, I was only 14!).But now I know much more. The movie is directed by one of the worlds most respected directors; Ridley Scott (Blade Runner, Alien, Hannibal). The cast list is also great, containing the names of such great actors as Russel Crowe, Connie Nielsen, Joaquin Phoenix and Richard Harris. The movie's soundtrack is also lovely! Mighty orchestral music composed by Hans Zimmer (Black Hawk Down, King Arthur), with a great supporting voice by Lisa Gerrard, which will make your tears fly.The movie is about a great Roman general, named Maximus (Crowe), who is betrayed by the Emperor's son, Commodus, (Phoenix) when he finds out that the emperor (Harris) doesn't want to make Commodus emperor after him, but rather make Maximus emperor. Maximus is being captured and is sent far into the wild with some Roman soldiers. Maximus is to be executed there, but he manages to kill the Roman soldiers and escape. Unfortunately, one of the Roman soldiers manages to wound him before he dies himself. When he comes home to his wife and son on a farm in Spain, he finds them both crucified. Filled with sorrow and hatred, tired from the ride and badly injured by the Roman, Maximus drops to the ground and faints.He is being picked up, and made a slave by a caravan of slavers. When the caravan reaches Zucchabar, most of the slaves, including Maximus, is bought by a Gladiator-trainer. After many gladiator-battles in different arenas, the remaining slaves travel to Rome, to fight in Colosseum. Maximus now realizes that this is his chance to get his vengeance on Commodus, who now is the emperor of Rome.Rildey Scott takes Hollywood pictures to the next level, with his brilliant fighting scenes, as well as the sad scenes. This movie is quite violent, but at the same quite sad, which is great! Because then the movie is perfect for both girls and boys.One of my favorite quotes is from this movie: ""My name is Maximus Desmus Maridius. Commander of the armies of the north. General of the Felix legions. Loyal servant of the true emperor, Marcus Aurelius. Father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife - And I will have my vengeance, in this life or the next.""This quote is from the scene when Maximus meets Commodus for the first time in the arena, and Commodus finds out that Maximus is alive.Just watch this movie, and buy the soundtrack while you're at it!As I said to my friends; There is a reason that such a great movie as Spartacus got 4 Academy Awards, while Gladiator got 5...",Gladiator

The movie points out how one name can bring down an entire empire. It's been said that there are 2 things you cant kill: 1. an idea and 2. one's Name. Throughout the movie Maximus shows so much integrity it's overwhelming towards the end of the movie. It makes you heart grow as you see how people that barely know you are ready to die for you because you stand for a symbol not because you did them a favor or saved their life.It's a man's movie in my own opinion because it punctuates some valors that women don't need.

2132,german_shady,The Best Historical Epic of this Generation.,10,13 November 2004,"Sure, a lot can be said for older historical epics like Spartacus, 300 Spartans, Ben-Hur, etc., but the fact of the matter remains that these are simply not entertaining for the majority of people under the age of 30, intellectual or not. The production is simply not good by today's standards. That said, I would like to justify my comment that Gladiator is the best historical epic from the 70s to present. The movie has impeccable acting from Russell Crowe, for which he won the Oscar as a lead. In many people's opinions, Joaquin Phoenix deserved the Best Supporting Actor nod for his wonderful performance as Commodus - to this day, whenever I see a picture of him, I see the evil character he portrayed in this great movie. The rest of the supporting actors were just as good, particularly Djimon Hounsou as Juba, Oliver Reed as Proximo, and Spencer Treat Clark as young Lucius. Whether you love or hate Ridley Scott, it is hard to deny that he directed this movie to near perfection. Of course, there were a few mistakes, such as the now-infamous crew member in blue jeans behind the horse after the opening battle, when Maximus and Lucilla are speaking. That said, this movie flows beautifully. I have watched it upwards of 20 times, and it still makes me cry each time, one of only 3 movies to ever do so. The script is above average for a historical epic, and this imperfection can easily be forgiven by the sheer beauty of the movie. The plot, however, is topped by none - the quest for vengeance for the slaughter of one's family. Although it may seem cliché, Gladiator reinvents the plot and the result is a movie superior to any with a similar plot before it. The action sequences were both engaging and thought-provoking as to the culture of the time and place. Russell did very well in these sequences. Not to mention the score by Zimmer matched the mood and intensity of every scene perfectly. To conclude, I for one have not seen a better historical epic, and every historical epic that I will ever see will be subconsciously compared to this masterpiece. Troy paled in comparison for many reasons. I expect great things of Alexander, but somehow I just don't think a movie will come along that replaces Scott's ""Gladiator"" as my favourite historical epic.",Gladiator

Instead I got a bloated Oscar bait film that had me cheering at the end not for its filmmaking style, but that it ended. The film is dull and the character of Maximus is in a clichéd story of a father seeking revenge against those who killed his family. I felt that it was more interestingly done, sadly, in Death Wish. Commodus is upset because his father wanted to put Maximus on the throne instead of him. So the film was sort of ripped off by Thor in every way, with one major difference.

2137,SlightlyEdible,Spectacular!... though the story is undeniably just okay.,6,16 October 2021,"Gladiator is a film that is superbly shot. Looking at behind the scenes footage, it's difficult not to admire how competently CGI and set designs were combined. The costuming especially is great. From my perspective the scenes shot in the opening setting of Germania and those set in the Coliseum received the most love, but it's all laudable nevertheless. The only real criticism I have regarding the filming aspect is the overuse of slow-motion. It's often used to highlight chaos, but it just looks terrible.No, Gladiator is an admirably made film. The real problems stem from the wasted potential. In my humble opinion the real history Gladiator is based off of makes for a far, far better story. Emperor Marcus Aurelius was the last in Rome's era of ""5 Good Emperors."" An era which lasted from AD 96-180, concluding with Marcus' death. Marcus himself logged many of his philosophical disciplines in a book dubbed Meditations, a staple of Stoicism. He was succeeded by his son and co-emperor, Commodus, who had no desire to administer the empire. Instead Commodus would abuse his power to spend the rest of his life fighting in gladiator battles against crippled opponents. Marcus, commonly held as one of the better or best Roman emperors, is contrasted by his son, held as one of the lesser or worst Roman emperors. Two major historical figures. One the epitome of Stoic philosophy who's book is read by people today (a US president even said he regularly reads it), and a complete hedonistic degenerate whom Rome assassinated while he was bathing. So what does Gladiator do with this massive potential?Well... it mostly just squanders it. Marcus doesn't say anything noteworthy other than, ""Emperors bad. Republic good."" Commodus is a maniac that the film ceases to have any sympathy for after the opening. The protagonist Maximus is a rather staid, unnoteworthy, honorable type. Maximus barely emotes interest in the movie's main sub-plot. That sub-plot of a political schism is underdeveloped and has no basis in reality. It really seems to exist just to give Maximus' quest for revenge more purpose. It also doesn't help that every character is a complete dumbass. Maximus is a dumbass who never spoke up publicly before it was too late. His allies are all dumbasses who spill their plans to children. The main antagonist is a dumbass (though to be fair the real Commodus also was). The end result is a standard, honor-bound revenge plot about restoring old values/society. The excellent score by Hans Zimmer and talented cast carry the emotional gravity of the scenes. It's unfortunate the writing doesn't. Wish to note I don't care about the lack of historical accuracy. I don't care they call the emperor Caesar instead of Princeps, or that the uniforms are are century too old. It's just they ignored great source material to deliver an acceptable but otherwise standard plot.Overall Gladiator is a pretty alright film. Ridley Scott once again proves he knows the ins-and-outs of filmmaking. The actors are all great for the content they have to work with. The sets and costuming are fantastic. I just wish the story wasn't so comparatively lacking. Gladiator squanders a man known as the ""Philosophical Emperor"" and his dissolute gladiator son to tell a story you've seen before. Albeit told satisfactory and with high production values, but hackneyed and told better before & after this film. Gladiator's the kind of film where you will remember the grandeur of it more than the characters. I recommend it, but I wish it realized its possibilities better.",Gladiator
2138,cata_r_86,Brilliant !!!,10,25 December 2005,"Purelly brilliant! I have no more comments on it because it's nothing to criticize... but only to appreciate, and for that it takes to much time, but because i must write at least ten lines let's see... I saw this movie i guess at least five times and i will see it again, and again, and again... because i just love it. The Roman Empire was in my opinion the greatest and gladiators' games were just an accomplishment for this. That's why nowadays we have only to appreciate everything Romans left. And about the movie, the cast is very well chosen, i think everybody fits its role, the plot is great and also has it mark of reality, and the director - Ridley Scott has made a great job. OK, see it for yourself!",Gladiator
2139,zyper,Thumbs up for Gladiator,10,25 December 2004,"Gladiator is indeed one of the top ten best movies ever produced today, I would say. The magnificent battle scenes with the crowd of the enormous Colosseum, interferes with the sad story in a splendid way, that takes your breath away for almost the entire movie. There couldn't possibly be any better actor to fill the place of the great gladiator with, than Russell Crowe (Insider). Maybe an even better, or at least as good as Crowe though, was the old actor Richard Harris, who unfortunately died a few years after playing Marcus Aurelius in Gladiator.I really like this one, and I will keep saying that it's a masterpiece in every way. Thumbs up for Gladiator!",Gladiator
2140,frontierblazer,Another Incredible Ridley Scott Film!,8,29 December 2004,"""Gladiator"" [2000] is another great directing feat for one of the Scott brothers (Ridley, this time). The story is a very touching one, though rather violent (as are most of the Scott bros. films) that takes place in the latter half of the second century. Russell Crowe's dynamic performance as Maximus, the drafted general who wishes for nothing but peace and a safe return home to his wife and children. Richard Harris is great as the dying Caesar Marcus Aurelius, who is a good friend of Maximus. Joaquin Phoenix also delivers an incredible performance as the emperor's son, Commodus (and he really looks the part); Connie Nielsen plays his beautiful, more intelligent sister.===SPOILERS=== After a great victory in Germania, Maximus requests leave to return home to his family. The Emperor, however, does not want to simply give Maximus away: He wishes Maximus, not his own son Commodus, to rule Rome in his stead, for he sees that Commodus is unfit to rule. Maximus cannot decide just yet. But when Marcus Aurelius tells Commodus of his choice, Commodus kills his father out of depression, and perhaps failed ambition to rule. Claiming his father has passed, Commodus takes command then and there. Maximus, however, sees right through Commodus and intends to inform the Senate of the Emperor's slaying. He is stopped and taken into the forest for execution (only real story flaw). He fights his way out of that and rides home, only to find his fields ablaze, his house raized, and his wife and young son crucified on their porch. Not long after, he is taken by a convoy of slave-herders out to a remote desert city where he and others are trained to fight as gladiators. Maximus fights his way through all others with the cream-of-the-crop, and is even befriended by his owner, a former gladiator himself, Proximo. He plans to have Maximus and the rest of his gladiators go to Rome to engage in combat before the masses, and the Emperor himself, which is what happens. Maximus is clearly the best of them all, which is recognized by Emperor Commodus. He comes down into the arena to meet with the mysterious champion. Hesitantly, he removes his mask, states exactly who he is, and essentially calls Commodus out, but in a way only he would understand. Commodus' nephew, of his sister, idolizes Maximus, which leads to his mother meeting with Maximus. Eventually, they scheme to spring Maximus from his cell, ride out to his hopefully loyal former army, charge the imperial palace, and give rule of Rome over to a willing Senator. The plan goes awry when Commodus and his spies hear word of the plan. The senator is arrested; and Maximus and his fellow gladiators fight their way out, suffering heavy losses, and only for Maximus to be captured. He is held until Commodus can finally decide what to do: He will fight Maximus in the Colosseum. But before they do, he wounds Maximus to weaken his strength and help himself win. The fight ends with Commodus slain under his own dagger by Maximus, who soon collapses and passes himself. ===SPOLIERS===I suppose the moral of this movie, if there is any, is ""Victory in life or death, neither is sweeter."" I think is a great film, probably the best of 2000, one of the best films of this decade, and the performance of Russell Crowe's career, except for ""A Beautiful Mind."" One of Ridley Scott's best directorial achievements. 8 out of 10 starsR for Intense, Graphic Combat.",Gladiator

2143,mailme-sumitbeniwal,Action Packed and Thrilling,8,8 October 2014,"Most films require that the viewer identifies with the character to truly be engrossed with the film. If you can't feel something for the character, than the audience is lost.Luckily, in Ridley Scott's case, Russel Crowe is so captivating and convincing as a general loved by his troops and as a slave loved by the people that the movie really works. Possibly one of the greatest actors today, Crowe carries this epic film on his very capable shoulders.Not to say that he is the only reason this works. The supporting cast, most notably Connie Neilsen, buoy the film to new perspectives.Jacquin Phoenix definitely captures the egotistic persona he should display, stealing every scene he's in. Phoenix will surely be put on the map with Gladiator.But the real shining star in this film are the incredible action sequences which jolt the viewer right in with the opening sequences, as Maximus' true worth to the Roman Empire is displayed. Scott's camera work within these completed sequences takes a modern twist that really works for the gruesome scenes.Crowe will now get the respect he deserves for this colossal performance. Gladiator makes the most of its 2 and a half hours, marking a triumphant comeback for the long forgotten epics of the classic days of film. ALL HAIL MAXIMUS",Gladiator

Although I saw many films coming from these historic backgrounds , this is the greatest one ever ! the film is full of blood like it was in the barbaric Rome at that age , but among all that bloodshed in the movie , you still can find a man that still looks to turn back home to his wife and his child and to live as a farmer ! .. bit unfortunately , destiny stands in front of him just to make him a legendary hero ! what the film might say is : a civilization must die once it does not respect human , treats him like an animal , and once morals and goodness are left behind its back , then the afterlife might be better !

2146,gregbash12,Gladiator Proves to be Fantastic,9,20 December 2013,"The world that Director Ridley Scott depicts for us in the film ""Gladiator"" is like no other fictional Rome before it. It is a grim, dark, world, but beautiful, in the most gory of ways. We follow Maximus (Russell Crowe) as he crashes to the cusp of death, only to slowly slash his way back up to honor and glory. It's these battle scenes that possess the perfect balance of awesome action and gripping suspense, only multiplying as the combat becomes increasingly important to the story. The next fight is always better than the last, because the stakes raise every time Maximus meets blades with another character.It's these violent and graphic scenes that personify the Rome that must be shown for ""Gladiator"" to work. We must accept Maximus' murdering and bloodshed because it seems to be the only way things are truly settled in the life of a gladiator. The violence that permeates the 155 minute picture from start to finish is necessary. It never feels overdone or boring. It is the foundation of this film, along with brilliant performances by Russell Crowe and Joaquin Pheonix, a great supporting cast, and a concise dialogue. The violent Rome is brought to us by great special effects, intense fight choreography, and the gritty camera angles that we longed for as soon as we saw Maximus in his magnificent Roman officer armor. ""Gladiator"" is a tale of honor and courage, in a world built on the foundations of blood and deceit, and Ridley Scott tells us the story masterfully.",Gladiator

And now I'm still overwhelmed by the feeling the movie gives me. It just the most perfect movie there is!!! The movie starts with a great opening, the only bad thing about the opening and maybe the whole movie is that when the soldiers fire the missiles you can see very good that this missiles are animated by a computer, they go to straight to be real. After that the movie starts slowly and keeps going faster till the end. Thats another reason why it is good. From the beginning till the end you just are watching as if you were there, this is meanly done by the music which fits perfectly by the pictures you see.

The recreation of ancient Rome is splendid, with all its magnificent buildings and atmosphere and he is able to show with all brightness the greatness of the Roman Empire, with its political problems and military discipline, and love and treason, of hate and jealousy, that still have a place in our world today. But the story has a glow of its own, to which all the beautiful scenery (believe me, it's awesome!!!) and great cinematography are just balancing factors. The plot is a rich one, that is as dynamic as it is present. He once again, after Blade Runner, 1492, and others helps us visit the depths of the human soul, which remains the same over all our historical and social experience. Even the fights, are displayed in such a way that all the blood is quite discrete, but still, making us feel like screaming and jumping out of our seats. I would also like to point out the performances of the cast, that is surprisingly good. We have some actors and actresses, who are not Hollywood icons, but are are greatly able to move the audience among screams and tears. All in all, we have guys like Russel Crowe, who are coming out to be part of a new and extremely promising harvest of people who are making each time more fans around the world.

2155,defaber05,Gladiator is packed full of action and suspense,10,30 June 2014,"Gladiator is a film that portrays a notorious general, Maximus Decimus Meridius (played by Russell Crowe), from ancient Rome that is betrayed by a jealous Prince, Commodus (played by Joaquin Phoenix). The Emperor, Marcus Aurelius (played by Richard Harris), of Rome is on his last leg of life and has decided to announce Maximus as his successor. When Commodus finds out that the new Emperor isn't going to be him Commodus decides to kill his father so he is named Emperor by default. On the day of Marcus's death, Maximus is ambushed and ordered to be executed from the orders of Commodus. Maximus finds a way to escape execution and immediately goes home to try and protect his family. He finds his family dead by being burnt alive and hung to display. Maximus now is set to revenge Marcus's and his family deaths.Throughout the movie, Maximus finds himself closer and closer to getting that revenge. He has to battle in the arenas and survive using his top of the line combat skills. Multiple scenes bring you up and close and personal to the combat. You see swift sward fighting and gruesome deaths. These scenes remind me of the movie ""Braveheart"" in terms of the actual battling. You see swords, bow and arrows, and spears being used to attach and defend individuals. All battle scenes give you a good feel on how good Maximus really is in terms of being a fighter.Once Maximus reaches the Coliseum, he has support from fans and his fellow colleagues. So in the first battle in the Coliseum, he creates a mini army in the ring and defeats the ones who were suppose to win. Once the battle is over, Maximus now has the support of the so- called mob. During this time whoever has the mob on their side has the power. Commodus finds out that Maximus is still alive and is the one winning all the support from the viewers. This irritates Commodus and becomes even more jealous of him. Commodus jealously and Maximus victorious battles are good for the film because it reassures the personal battles have for one another and strengthens the theme of the film. The colors and lighting of the film give you a sense of darkness up until the final battle. You have Maximus and Commodus in the middle of a white sand ring and Commodus is wearing white. This brightens the mood of the film because finally Maximus has his chance to kill Commodus. During a 3-minute battle between Commodus and Maximus, Maximus prevails and kills off Commodus. This part of film you are relieved because the Maximus finally accomplishes what was right. Maximus's wood prior to battle is just enough to have him die at the end but not before Commodus. So Maximus accomplishes not only revenge the death of Marcus but then being reunited with his family in the after life. The film makes you become a fan of Maximus and a hater of Commodus throughout. Its full of suspense and action and I would recommend it to anyone.",Gladiator

The production values for this movie is extraordinary. In the year 180, the death of emperor Marcus Aurelius (Richard Harris) throws the Roman Empire into chaos. Maximus (Russell Crowe) is one of the Roman army's most capable and trusted generals and a key adviser to the emperor.

Maximus, the over all hero, is forced to become a gladiator and compete in the games after being falsely accused of killing the emperor of Rome. As a general, he is very skilled with a sword, that helps his odds of surviving. Caesar is the over all bad guy trying to kill Maximus because his father wanted him to be emperor of Rome. The emperor tries everything to kill Maximus. He even tries to put a legendary fighter to kill him. This is somewhat historically correct due to Rome wanting to be a Republic again, the Coliseum, the gladiators, and the Caesar.

It makes up for it when he goes to heaven and sees his wife and his child. When the slaves do the formation of the roman army in the battle against seasoned gladiators, they just kick their butts.

2159,keatz77,A beautiful motion picture,9,1 October 2014,"When looking for a movie a person looks for something that will entrain oneself. Gladiator brings in the factor of being entrain with also giving the audience a stunning look at ancient Rome, as they follow Roman general Maximus played by Russell Crowe, as he gets beaten down and made into a gladiator, then rises up and takes his revenge. Whether it's the moment Maximus dies or when he is talking to Marcus Aurelius each scene brings in an aspect of suspense or grittiness. As each scene unfolds, Ridley Scott is able to capture the emotions of the characters and, the tension each of them are facing. Each fight Maximus has the audience knows it could be his last one and wanting him to fight on. Ridley Scott is able to craft a beautiful motion picture, using the actors' performance, and a stunning sound track to make the movie come alive. The moment Maximus arrives to his villa after almost being exuded, he knew there was something amiss, the music of this scene, brought in the heartbreak and hopelessness to this situation when Maximus discover his entire family was brutally murdered. Then the shear agony Russell Crowe showed really brought me in on how Maximus had lost everything and everyone who he ever loved. This scene shows how the movie is much more than a man fighting in the area as a gladiator but as a man fighting for revenge for his loved ones that can't call out to him anymore. Also Russell Crowe's performance gives the character Maximus a sense of justice with is body statue to compliment it. ""Crowe's performance comes from an instinctive mastery of look and gesture and a powerful physical presence."" (Desmond Ryan). His battle harden look and motion of how he will restore Rome to its former glory, makes the audience believe in the character as a whole.Alongside Russell Crow's performance, Joaquin Phoenix performance as Commodus, the son of Marcus Aurelius and Empire of Rome, gave a crazy, ruthless, power hungry dictator a new look. Straight from the start of the movie, the audience could see how foolish he was as a person, when he stepped on the battle field. But scene when Commodus kills his father to become empire, Phoenix molded the character as paranoid and driven man who would stop at nothing to achieve his goals. As the film went on Joaquin Phoenix fulfillment of the character, make onlookers how far he is willing to go to stay in power and not have Maximus over throw him. ""As played by Mr. Phoenix, Commodus is like a serious version of Dr. Evil, coming on to his sister (Connie Nielsen) while she pines for Maximus in this brazen mix of blood sport."" (Elvis Mitchell). The scene when he does not know what to about the senate not approving in the actions he put forth, Phoenix's body language, set of dialog shows the despite and paranoid out looked on this cruel world. The role of a supporting actor or actress is to help push the plot forward, and Joaquin Phoenix does it quite swimmingly.Being able to build a scene up is one of the most important thing a movie needs to do, along with great actors to drive the plot forward, part of building that scene up is the use of an original film score to create a tone. Each time Maximus steps in the coliseum to fight, the music brings in his hopes, desires, of how he is felling. Then when the fighting beginnings the music speeds up allowing the audience feel the same way as the character. ""Music is a big factor in helping the illusion of the film come to life. The same way music brings back different periods of our lives."" (Francis Ford Coppola) This quote from Coopola tells why music is so important in movies. At the end of the movie when Maximus kills Commodus but then dies from the wound Commodus inflicted him before fight, Maximus starts to lose consciousness he sees the gate to the other world, the world where his wife and child are waiting for him to return. The music sets in bring in the realization to Maximus that he is finally home with his family. The music of this scene drives the emotions of Maximus when finally arrives home to his family after helping to save Rome from a tyrant. Gladiator to me is one of this generations best movies, pulling off some amazing cinematography that can only be compared to some of the best movies. I believe Gladiator should be watch by all to see spectacular acting and subnational music. Though this movie came out 14 years ago it still a wonderful movie.",Gladiator

Amazing acting with Russel Crowe as Maximus, he was perfect for the part, and I don't think i could envision anyone else playing this part. Phoenix had that intensity that was very quiet, perfect for an antagonist like Commodus. He kills Maximus' family, which consists of his wife and kids. Maximus' realizes that he needs to get his revenge. Five gladiator contests in all. First the slave fight, which was not my favorite but still pretty good. Then came the Maximus solo. That's when he started to show everyone that he was simply not going to die, even though the emperor (Commodus) thinks that he is dead after he sent assassins after him. But Maximus fought them off and lived. Then come the chariots. The third best fight. Very intense scene with all off the fighting. Following that, Maximus has to fight a tiger and an undefeated champion. Maximus lives on and beats the champion. Commodus had no choice, but to fight Maximus himself. Of course, Maximus is stronger, but after bing stabbed by Commodus, he weakens. After slicing Commodus, and then driving a knife into his throat, Commodus died. Then following that, Maximus died from the wounds, but not before he had gotten his revenge.",Gladiator
2164,ryanguglielmi,Assignment or HUMN 246,10,8 February 2015,"Film Review on IMDb: GladiatorRussell Crowe stars as Maximus in the Academy Award winning Gladiator. The story takes place during the height of the Roman Empire. Maximus is the general of Rome's northern army and faithful servant of Cesar Marcus Aurelius played by Richard Harris. The film begins with a final battle in Germania, a battle that Maximus leads his army to victory and peace throughout the empire. Once victory has been achieved Marcus Aurelius asks Maximus to serve as the protector of Rome after his death and to make Rome a republic once again. Marcus Aurelius informs his son, Commodus, of his plans to make Rome a republic. Commodus murders his father and Maximus will not pledge his support to Commodus. Commodus orders Maximus to be killed and for his family to meet him in the afterlife. The theme of Gladiator is how one man's action can have an impact on everyone else but it can come at great personal sacrifice. Throughout the film the audience is shown more about the character of Maximus. In the beginning of the film he is shown as a great General who only desires to be home with his family. Even after great triumph in battle he is possibly going to delay his journey home at the request of the Cesar. The request brings no wealth to Maximus but only extends his time away from home but it would be for the good of the people of the Roman Empire. Even though we do not get to hear his decision, the audience has a feeling that he will say yes and carryout Marcus Aurelius' wishes. After the death of his wife and son, Maximus is seen in a depressed state. He shows no desire to live but seems to rekindle his honor in a fight that he is chained hand in hand with a fellow slave. Maximus once again puts his desires aside and fights thus preserving the fellow slaves' life. Finally, Maximus is able to kill Commodus, but in doing so he gives up his own life for the good of the empire. As he takes his final breaths Maximus reveals the wishes of Marcus Aurelius, which Rome is to be a republic and to end the corruption that has poisoned it.Gladiator uses many different filming techniques but the two that standout the most our lighting and angle. Maximus is portrayed as a strong and moral individual, it is this reason that Marcus Aurelius loves him more than his own son and chooses to put his faith in him. The camera angle really helps to show Maximus as strong individual. Russell Crowe is of average height, he is in shape for the movie but he is not physically intimidating. However, during the movie the camera angle shot for him is often in an upward angle. The gives the audience a sense of him being larger and someone you are looking up towards. Also, in the film the lighting around Maximus is always light. Once again, this technique is showing Maximus as a good character. All of these techniques and details that go into this character provide someone for the audience to feel and cheer for. On the other hand, Commodus, always has dark lighting. He is rarely shown in light lighting. This goes well for his character who is a menacing and evil individual who cares little for those around him. Gladiator's universal theme of a moral individual doing what is right even though it comes with great personal sacrifice speaks to audiences around the world. This story inspires you to want to do what is right and to be a strong individual. It is not surprising that this film and others that are similar in theme such as Braveheart have done so well. These films provide the audience with a little different mindset as they exit the theatre or turn off their television set. In one of the final moments of the movie the audience receives chills down their spine as Lucilla says ""he was a solider of Rome honor him"".",Gladiator

2167,xzibit1613,an epic film,10,22 June 2005,"If you demand to truly feel the outstanding beauty of the Roman Empire, Gladiator will supply it, in majestic form. This movie is so powerful, you will be hard pressed not to feel as though you are living as a Roman nearly 1900 years ago. The depictions of the empire are glorious and breathtaking. The music counteracts with the storyline superbly. As emotions stir amongst characters, so too does the harmonious script. I feel that if one compares his or her own lives and dreams to the heart of Maximus and the soul of Rome, the real connection can be made. The character Maximus, played by Russell Crowe is inspiring and motivating. Gladiator teaches us all that we must conquer our dreams, but they must first be realized, and in us all is the endangerment of becoming better people.",Gladiator

He practically froths at the mouth from his box as gladiators butcher one another. As for Crowe: if you have any doubts about his acting ability, please see Romper Stomper (1993). His character in that movie, the charismatic but terrifyingly cold leader of a gang of skinheads, is the polar opposite of the one he plays here in Gladiator.The soundtrack, insipid new age vocals, is so bad it nearly ruined the movie for me. What starts out embarrassingly anachronic, by climax just grates. Scott managed to get competent innovative sound out of Vangelis for Blade Runner, so what's up here?",Gladiator

To be honest i think they were just stupid..there is another possibility. They didn't bother to see the movie before voting, they just saw the trailer and didn't understand it, so they voted.

Every single detail: from a perfect cast, to flawless acting, flawless script, the most ascetically amazing and magnificent sets of all time, costume design's are flawless, the directing and editing was absolutely brilliant: you can go frame by frame line by line detail to detail and you will not find any flaws. Even the greatest movies of all time have either a minor plot flaw, or someone does a bad acting job, or their was a casting flaw (someone who just stuck out your head that would be better for a certain part), their is almost always flaws in a certain scene's that could be improved upon or if you could go back in time and change certain things you would. In this movie there is not one single thing in that could be improved upon down to smallest of details. Their is are not any scene's, line's, setting, or expressions in the movie that could be improved upon. No other film has ever been this perfect on so many levels. If it was possible to go back in time and re-shoot this movie again and again starting with everything the same everything, the chances of everything being executed this perfect again are extremely slim for a film of this scale. This movie raised the bar as high as it can go and the bar cannot be raised any higher. Just like you cannot travel faster than speed of light this movie cannot be surpassed. The best any future movie can do is tie and chances of a future movie being this perfect are not very likely. You would have better chances of winning the LOTTO several times then to see another movie that is executed so perfectly in every way.You may enjoy another movie more, because of different factors like your favorite genre or you, somehow dislike some part of this movie for some strange reason like you are scarred of a little blood or violence.

2173,DarrenJBenjamin,Favourite Film,10,28 January 2016,This has to be my favourite movie of all time. It's a classic. Russell Crowe's performance is out of this world and the award for best actor in that years Oscar was well deserved. He played the roll of a lifetime. What always fascinated me about going to watch this movie was I never watched one single trailer prior to going but was gripped from the beginning The other character's are also extremely strong and the storyline and pathway the film takes isn't something that hasn't seen before but certainly is moving and believable There isn't a great film without great music and Han Zimmer's score in this is arguably his greatest work. The theme and variations are so strong and the attention to detail of the style that was necessary for that period is fantastic. It's been 16 years since it came out and still has the same edge about it and that is the mark of a great film. You would happily watch it over and over.,Gladiator

Jauquin Phoenix was completely believable as the flawed young emperor.Colleen Neilsen used her limited time on the screen to portray the Emporers daughter in a delicate and beautiful manner. What a pleasure to watch Richard Harris in his role as the Marcus Aurelias. I want to see Juba and Maximus reunited in further adventures. I refuse to let this story end. I will not say goodbye to Maximus. His powerful image, as portrayed by Mr. Crowe, lives too vividly in my mind. I have enjoyed watching the huge endeavor that created the story of this historical era with all the beautiful costumes and structured scenes, in the words of Commodus,again and again and again.

The movie has also portrayed loyalty to your nation as being of the utmost importance. He carried on inspite of all his suffering, fought hard and cleverly in order to save the Roman Empire.The film has beautiful scenic depictions. The scenes which show the afterlife make it look like the perfect place to be. The way in which home and family is described by Crowe, even though describing the ordinary, makes it appear like the perfect place to be. The music is pretty enchanting as well and gives the film a nice look.The fighting scenes give a description of the Roman Empire in the ancient times.

I'm not saying that any one part of the film was phenomenal in itself, but I'm saying that rounding all the details and considering all aspects, this is a great movie for anyone. The movie involved the trails and tribulations of a tried man, and his journey throughout the film led to great screenplay and exiting action at points. I don't think it was perfect, and the most room for improvement lies in the acting of minor characters, lighting, and sometimes the balance of sound. Other than that though, screen-play was good enough to cover a lot of possible errors in acting, but some it just didn't. I recommend this movie to anyone, and will probably watch several more times.",Gladiator
2183,haleygirl-32497,Movie Review and Style,7,11 May 2016,"A General who is tired of war wants nothing more than to be with his family; a wife and a son in Spain. His name is Maximus (Russell Crowe). Since Emperor Marcus Aurelius became the Caesar, General Maximus has been at his loyal command. He has sworn his utmost allegiance to Emperor Marcus who trusts -- not even his own son, Commodus, the rightful heir -- the general to lead Rome. To take his place as Caesar. It was soon after this conversation that Emperor Marcus is announced dead. Commodus explains to Maximus that it was of ""natural causes,"" when in truth it was he, Commodus, that killed the emperor. Having caught wind of the concursion between father and general, Commodus arranged for General Maximus to be disposed of -- permanently.After escaping the secret execution, Maximus rides home to only find his farmland and family burnt and crucified. In complete distraught and sadness, he faints and is picked up by a slave caravan and is taken to Zucchabar, where he begins his new battles, not as a general, but as a slave.This movie has many qualities that makes it a ""complete"" movie. It has a story, as simple as it may be, that is moving and full of action, conspiracy, and beautiful filming techniques. In terms of slavery, this movie does a pretty darn good job at representing the most intriguing form of Roman slavery. Gladiators.In Roman history, a lot of times slaves were picked up due to abandonment, such as children with no guardians. Maximus was picked up and became a slave. With the Romans, which the movie portrayed, anyone that was a slave was equal in slavery means. In other words, their prices did not vary due to skin color or race. All slaves had an equal price, unless certain arrangements were made, such as doubling the price of gladiators.What I found interesting was the idea of winning over the crowed will get your freedom. When Maximus completed his first alone fight, he yelled at the spectators, ""Are you not entertained?"" This caught the attention of a man. He would tell the ex-general how to be a gladiator and earn his freedom. He could not kill quickly. He had to win the crowed. He had to get the people on his side for ""the mob is Rome.""Throughout the movie there is various spiritual references. An example being when one of the slaves wishes good luck to Maximus for ""red is god's color."" We also see that Maximus has visions of going to meet his family in the afterlife or Elysium. This might have been meant for a form of foreshadowing.There are many positive takes from this movie in forms of character and vengeance. Right away we know the Maximus is a man of honor. He is incorruptible. Turning down a life of riches and fame because it is not his beliefs and violates any and all of his principles. Also let us not forget the fact that with the lesson of good and evil, Commodus gets a rude awakening.Lucille, Commodus's sister, knew Maximus from the past. She paid him a visit before his next time in the arena. They were conversing about the power of Rome when Maximus exclaimed, ""I am a slave. What possible difference can I make?"" I found this a little disturbing. He has gone all this way to fight and become a gladiator to seek his vengeance, and then he makes a comment like this. It sounds as if he has given up. Lucille assures him he can. That he will change Rome. He will bring the greatness that Rome has envisioned for so long. He did. Maximus brought honor to the city. It made the people see a true warrior. A true soldier. Maximus has struck the hearts of many for he was General that was brought down to a slave and became an honorable gladiator that changed the fate of Rome.No matter what. Slave or not. Anyone can make a difference. Anyone can change something if they so desired. Their hearts and minds have to be set and then just then will they achieve something of greatness.",Gladiator

Their loyalty is admirable, and to be friends with them would be priceless.Gladiator was the first of many epic films that premiered between 2000 and 2005. And, I think, it is the best of them.

Russel Crow plays the fictional character Maximus Decimus, he was a mighty man a valor, a man who was held in high esteem by the Roman emperor, Marcus Aurelius played by Richard Harris. Although Maximus was a man of good character and integrity, he was at odds with the emperor's son Commodus, played by Joaquin Phoenix. Commodus envied Maximus because of the high regard father had for Maximus, sharing a father and son line relationship that Commodus envied. Commodus wrongly inherited the Roman throne at the demise of his late father, Marcus Aurelius. This film captivates you from the start, showing off the subtle beauty and ambiance of Rome. From the country side, to the battlefield, this film gives its viewers a glimpse of what it was like during the reign of some of the worlds most powerful and affluent emperors. Director Ridley Scott, did an astonishing job as he was able to recreate an unforgettable experience, giving viewers front row seats to the battlefields and dynasties of the Roman empire around 180AD. The movie and its graphics were utterly breathtaking. Another part of the movie that captivated me was the battle scenes, where we got to see how the Roman gladiators fought, what weapons they used, the raiment they wore. It all added to the experience of being at the front lines of battle. Russell Crow did an astonishing job, playing his character Maximums. I mean, he was so into character, if you will, he was believable, you could feel his emotion and love for his family through the movie screen, and his fearless to avenge his family's wrongful death. To me, the film Gladiator reminds me of a combination of Braveheart and 300, both war movies that both have similar themes and storylines throughout the film. Overall this movie is great for just about anyone. Especially for those who share an interest with accent Rome, war and love. This film is full intense scenes that keep you engaged and enthralled throughout the film. From the intensifying battle scenes to the subtle radiance of the Roman corn fields. This film is hands down, one of my favorites. There are those movies that you watch only once, and then there are movies like Gladiator, the ones considered to be a modern day classic film that can be watched for years to come.",Gladiator

2219,gshaw2,one of only five motion pictures to be judged as 'epic'!,10,5 November 2006,"Superb, grand in scale, (as with 'Lawrence of Arabia') and required 'courage' to produce as 'toga and sandals genre' motion pictures do not 'fair well' at the box office! Gladiator is only one of five motion pictures classified as 'Epic'! The film was a huge success and yet, Riley Scott, although nominated for an Academy Award as Best Director, lost to Sodenberg. 'Traffic' is non-linear and dark. 'Erin Brokenvich' displays 'substantial' cleavage! AMP ARTS AND SCIENCE continues to baffle me as to why Director's such as Ridley Scott and Martin Scorese are passed-over! Does any one remember the director of the film 'The Piano'? I do not watch 'The Oscars'- which is a waste of time!",Gladiator
2220,ninadonchegay,A classical masterpiece,10,15 February 2019,"Like most comments also mention gladiator has everything in it to create this intensive atmosphere. Every minute the movie becomes more interesting. The directing of Ridley Scott is exceptional and the actors are perfect for each role, especially Russell Crowe which won for best actor, he plays every part extraordinarily. My personal favorite scene that threw shivers down my spine was when he took he's mask of and presented himself in front of the emperor, this scene was amazing and so well played and of course directed and written. Another one of my favorite parts was when the emperor stood in front of Maximus telling him the story of « a general, who became a slave, who became a gladiator, who defied an emperor » i also see this phrase as a quote.
To finish this comment gladiator is one of my favorite movies and if you haven't watched it yet then you should it will never disappoint.",Gladiator
2221,benwnoble,Are You Not Entertained?,10,17 January 2019,"Gladiator is a masterpiece of revenge, power through awe, and the incredible production and acting. The roman warrior motifs of honor and glory combined with emotions and loss house an unforgettable movie.
It all unfolds in Ancient Rome where a prestigious general of a large army meets with the emperor during a battle. The emperor tells the general, Maximus Decimus Meridias, that he will give the throne to Maximus when he passes. After that, he calls his son, Commodus, in and shares the news. His son kills him in anger. He lies that the throne is his and demands Maximus to either join him or die. Maximus refuses and then escapes death. He comes home to find his family killed and his house burned with them. From everything to nothing, he is then captured by slave traders and through a series of events, he ends up a gladiator. He spends the rest of his time using the glory of a honorable gladiator to take the throne as his own in a path he could not have predicted.
The theme of revenge is this movie. Maximus was guided by revenge in all of his actions. His desire was unstoppable. The film makes sure that you feel sympathetic for Maximus as he loses his life in a single day. But if you take a step out of the perspective the director offers there is a moral dilemma for us all. The question to ask is: To what extent can revenge consist of before becoming unjustified? Does Commendus deserve death, prison, or what? The director expresses his opinion at the end on what the situation warrants.
The other major theme shown is power through awe. Maximus gains power through the people and their perspective. It is directly relatable to our world today. If people entertain us, we will support and follow them. In Gladiator, it is taken advantage of by Maximus. He realizes it after his first battle and the people are on their feet cheering while the camera swivels around Maximus as he gradually figures out what he has just accidentally devised. Almost how President Trump gained his following largely through gaining attention in the media, Maximus gained reputation through entertainment.
There is a reason Russell Crowe, the actor of Maximus, won the Academy Award for Best Actor for Gladiator. He truly played the idea of a man losing his life. Just the way he almost seemed silent and speechless as if he just still was shocked about what had happened. The flashbacks from his farm and family collides with reality and you see it in Russell's eyes and tone as he fades between the two. The mood he sparkes will make any viewer close to tears. His excellence in playing Maximus prevails throughout the movie and conveys sympathy to the viewer, generating an emotion connection to the character.
The soundtrack is filled with honor and glory of a true roman patriotic warrior. It fits perfectly in the setting and motifs of Gladiator. The soundtrack added an immense amount of emotion to convey Maximus' expressions to our heart. The audience is prepared through the setup of Russell's acting from action scenes to messages of family and glory and once the soundtrack hits your emotions come crashing with it. In the right moments, the soundtrack enlightens the honor and glory of the movie admirably.
The only issue I have is the realism. It's a historic film and as a man of realism myself, it hurts to see people die in a finger snap from an arrow no the chest. While it is not perfect, I must applaud how much it differs from current mainstream movies such as the movies by the director Michael Bay whom loves to have explosions and extremely intense gunfire where military marines miss all their shots on the main character running away in an open field. So in a sense, I can not say it was far off ideal as it is in an arm length's away.
Similarly to the movie, The Blind Side, where the main character has nothing at the beginning and you find yourself feeling sympathy for the character, Gladiator bring that same hopeful and inspiring tone in a roman-era twist that affixes honor and glory. Gladiator has been my favorite film ever since I saw it. The components all manufacture an astonishing production of emotion and glory. With that being said, I require you to watch it immediately. You will never regret it.",Gladiator
2222,chappy_is_a_leice_fan,This film gave me Parkinson's.,1,14 February 2019,"I finished watching this film around three hours ago and I am still absolutely furious that I have wasted 2:35mins of my life. I haven't been able to stop shaking my head since and have now self diagnosed myself with Parkinson's.
I had been looking forward to watching this film for years. After reading many reviews celebrating how much of a cinematic marvel Gladiator is, my expectations were high. How wrong I was. I should've realised that the morons in this world had voted a fool into the White House, they had voted for Brexit and they chose to support teams like Tottenham Hotspur. So my faith in humanity should've made me realise this film would be poor.
The story is slower than a woman getting ready for a dinner date. The linear plot was so easy to fathom out and left me wondering how would this grip me? It wouldn't. The main characters left me with no emotional attachment as the acting, plot and script were so mundane, bland and boring. The film could've finished easily an hour and a half earlier, but I believe that Ridley Scott purposely wanted to inconvenience us. Therefore decided to add in pointless storylines such as Commodus and his sisters relationship, Maximus and his flashbacks to his home and over doing the Gladiator fight scenes (which equate to a total of 5 terrible minutes of action throughout the film).
Ironically this is a film about revenge, and I now intend to seek revenge on Ridley Scott for making this film, for making myself sit through two and a half hours of dreadful cinematography and for giving me Parkinson's disease.",Gladiator
