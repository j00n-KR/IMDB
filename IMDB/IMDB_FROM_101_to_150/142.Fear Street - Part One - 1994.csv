0,SnoopyStyle,nostalgia horror,7,7 July 2021,"It's 1994 in Shadyside, Ohio. A masked killer attacks a mall after closing time. It's the latest in a series of regular folks turning into serial killers dating back to 1666 with a witch killing. A group of teenagers get entangled in the town's curse.Netflix seems to be trying for a combination of Scream and Stranger Things. The first thing I noticed is the saturation of 90's music. It's interesting to place this movie two years before Scream. I was thinking that these characters should reference Scream and other shows but most of them are not out at that time. They should still do some referencing. They could at least mention Flatliners. As for the story, this is based on a series of books which I have no idea about. All I know is that the opening is basically pulled from Scream. It's good. Copying is not a sin in Hollywood. The rest is gathering a group of teens to go up against supernatural killers. The teens are fine in that they're a bunch of brats. Other than one minor surprise, there is nothing too new or too outstanding. It's a good horror until the ending. I have an issue with the kids' tactics and it's also setting up for a prequel. I'm not usually a fan of prequels. I like this movie but I'm less sure about any follow-up.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
1,nogodnomasters,It began as a prank,7,21 October 2021,"The film opens with Heather (Maya Hawke ) who works at B. Dalton at the Shady Side Mall being killed by a Spencer worker (David W. Thompson) in a skeleton outfit. This was one of the many mass killings on Shady Side, an economically depressed area juxtaposed by rival Sunny Vale where only good things happen. The back story is about Sarah Fier (pronounced Fear) a witch who was killed and then cursed a revenge. The rivalry between the two high schools lead to an accidental disturbance of Sarah's grave who is enacting revenge.A bunch of kids screaming and running around from reanimated killers. Music by NIN. They work the back story very well. Good characters.Guide: F-word. Near sex. No nudity.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
2,kosmasp,Putting the Fier into it,8,20 July 2021,"How do people who only watch this one entry feel about it? I reckon dissatisfied. Because the movie is only part of something bigger and tough to just judge on its own merits. Having said that, I personally feel it works as a standalone too - like a tv show that cuts off and leaves you out in the cold in the end - but was really good up to that point.In this case you have the choice to watch more and get a ... as some say fresh take on the slasher genre. Because while this kind of feels like a slasher movie ... it isn't. And you can tell early on, that there is more. It is only visual and it's a bit of a cheat (all things considering), but it does make sense - yes suspend your disbelief! You have to, no doubt about it.Another thing that there is no doubt about: you can't be squeamish! While there is nothing much here when it comes to nudity (and only a small amount of what could be called sexy time), there is a lot of blood and violence! As one should be expecting to see from a slasher ... on the violence scale that is. And just when you think you can sit back comfortably and relax .. the movie pulls you back in - quite literally working on the .. brain (pun very much intended)",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
3,Sleepin_Dragon,It's an interesting watch.,6,18 July 2021,"Shadyside, a town with a bloody past, and following recent events, a bloodthirsty present.I thought the opening scenes were great, I was instantly reminded of Scream, it's a slasher movie, but it's a little different. I like how bleak it is, and naturally it's made with today's politics. A few scenes feel like they've been lifted from other films, but I suppose there are only so many ways of doing things.So to begin with, it looks good, even though it perhaps doesn't look very 1994, not sure I remember it being such a high glam era.Best of all is the music, I don't care what anyone says, this was a great era for music, way ahead of the trash today, we have Radiohead, Portishead, and several other classics.I see number's two and three are out, talk about an impatient audience.It kept me entertained, 6/10.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
4,lee_eisenberg,your social status won't help you,6,9 July 2021,"I had never heard of the Fear Street books before watching this movie. What was particularly interesting was that, like ""Stranger Things"", ""Fear Street: 1994"" looks at the class differences. It's nothing great, but I did like it, and I'll be eager to see parts 2 and 3.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
5,Tweekums,Decent enough mid-nineties set teen slasher film,7,12 July 2021,"The town of Shadyside, Ohio has had an unusually high murder rate throughout its existence. Every few year it seems there is another massacre perpetuated by a previously normal person; some link these the execution of a witch in 1666. In the opening sequence there is another; a young man in a skeleton mask kills seven people in a mall before being shot by the police. After a vigil for those killed leads to confrontation with kids from the 'perfect' neighbouring town; this ends in an incident involving protagonist Deena and other Shadysiders and a trio from Sunnyvale, including Deena's ex, Samantha, and her new boyfriend. In the aftermath Sam disturbs some bones in an unmarked grave. Soon afterwards Deena sees somebody in a skeleton mask... a person trying to scare people or something more sinister? Given the genre we know it is the latter; it appears that those at the scene of the incident are about to be hunted down.To fully appreciate this film it will probably be necessary to watch the remaining two parts of the trilogy; that said the story does feel complete. It starts really well with a scene that is a clear nod to 'Scream'. It then quickly introduces the main protagonists and through Deena's brother's fascination with the town's macabre history we learn about various past killings. Once it is clear what was happening there were plenty of scary moments and a few gory kills... especially two near the end involving characters I thought might survive. There is plenty of '90s music to remind us when it is set; perhaps a bit too much at times. The cast do a solid enough job; certainly better than some of those who starred in classic, dirt-cheap, early slashers. If I have a real complaint it is that it is about twenty minutes too long. Overall though I thought this was a decent enough slasher film that fans of the genre will probably want to check out; hopefully the next two films will be as good or better.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
6,BA_Harrison,What's your favourite scary movie? Not this one!,4,11 July 2021,"For centuries, the impoverished town of Shadyside has been the site of gruesome murder sprees, the senseless slayings attributed to psychotic individuals who suddenly 'snap'. Some of the locals believe otherwise: they say that the killers were possessed by the spirit of Sarah Fier, a witch who was put to death in 1666, and who will continue to curse Shadyside until her severed hand is reunited with the rest of her body.Keen to repeat the success of Stranger Things, Netflix blends that show's nostalgic retro feels with the '90s slasher revivalism of Scream (and just a smidge of Blair Witch) to bring us Fear Street Part 1: 1994. Unfortunately, no matter how many classic tunes they use on the soundtrack, and no matter how many pop culture visual references are squeezed into the frame, the film never feels like anything other than a product of Generation Z, director Leigh Janiak failing to capture the vibe of the times, and his young cast never convincing as youths of the '90s.The opening scene is either a rip-off of Wes Craven's iconic slasher or a homage, but either way, we're on very familiar ground: generic stalk and slash that relies heavily on clumsy exposition and contrivance. The young characters are all inclusive - a mix of race and sexual orientations to tick all the boxes - which would be fine if only they weren't so damn whiney, with emotional baggage that makes Sydney from Scream seem well adjusted by comparison. They're all so irritating that one longs for them to be gorily dispatched, which thankfully, quite a few of them are. They're a long time coming, but a couple of the death scenes are amazingly bloody - more so than I expected - with a juicy bread slicing machine kill that leaves a real mess, and a great axe in the head effect.4/10 - Had they got shot of the hugely annoying emotional drama and upped the level of gore throughout, this would have been leaner and meaner and a whole lot more enjoyable.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
7,paul_haakonsen,Good old fashioned fun...,6,11 August 2021,"I sat down to watch the 2021 movie ""Fear Street: 1994"" without knowing anything about it, aside from it being a horror movie, and the first in a trilogy. But of course, with it being a movie that I hadn't already seen and it being a horror movie, of course I had to watch it.And director Leigh Janiak actually managed to churn out a fairly entertaining movie here. One that had a reminiscent feeling of those wonderful 1980s slasher flicks that I grew up watching.The storyline here was interesting and definitely had lots of things going on. And I will say that the enjoyed the aspect of having killers from various decades show up to terrorize the town. Sure, the storyline was fairly predictable and didn't really offer much in terms of ups and downs to throw off the audience. But it still made for adequate entertainment.The killers in the movie were very different from one another, which was something that I liked about ""Fear Street: 1994"". And there were some okay killings in the movie, though nothing like what you had back in the 1980s during the slasher films golden age.I wasn't familiar with a single actor or actress on the cast list here. And that is something that I enjoy in movies, as the performers are not associated with other previously portrayed characters in other movies. So that was a good thing for the movie.Something that was rather nice in ""Fear Street: 1994"" was the soundtrack. Lots of good old metal and industrial metal sounds here.Ultimately then ""Fear Street: 1994"" is an entertaining and enjoyable movie. And I was genuinely entertained from start to end. And as the movie came to an end, and they showed what was upcoming in part two, I must admit that I am looking forward to watching part two, as it seemed to be a hands down homage to the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise.My rating of ""Fear Street: 1994"" lands on a six out of ten stars.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
8,BandSAboutMovies,Way better than expected,7,6 July 2021,"I was born a bit too late for R. L. Stein, sadly. His Goosebumps books were a big deal with my wife, as are the Fear Street books. Written for older teens, these take place in the city of Shadyside, a place cursed by the Fier family. Unlike Goosebumps, these books were packed with more scares and plenty of violence.There was an attempt to make a series out of the stories way back in 1997 with Ghosts of Fear Street, which aired on ABC Television on July 31 of 1998. Several years later and the books have finally become a series of movies.Spoiler mode on if you haven't seen this yet...The film takes a page out of Scream by starting off with the death of its most well-known actor, Maya Hawke, who plays Heather, a B. Dalton's employee who is killed by her Spencer's employee friend Ryan with no warning as they close the mall. I really enjoyed this open, particularly the fact that every single one of the chains in it were dead stores. This isn't a mall for the sake of a mall; this truly captures what it was like to close a store when the rest of the world is living a life outside your retail life.Her death is just another massacre for Shadyside, Ohio, the murder capital of the United States. And yet, right across the tracks lies Sunnyvale, one of the richest and safest cities in the country. Nearly every teen in Shadyside has grown up believing that Sarah Fier placed a curse on their town before being executed for witchcraft in the incredibly foreboding year of 1666.Our heroine is Deena Johnson (Kiana Madeira) and her life is in shambles. She's pretty much raising a brother named Josh (Benjamin Flores Jr.) who lives in chat rooms. Her two best friends Simon (Fred Hechinger) and Kate (Julia Rehwald) make a living selling drugs and her closeted girlfriend Sam (Olivia Scott Welch) has left her behind in the move to Sunnydale.At a vigil for the latest massacre, Deena and Sam reconnect just in time for a riot to cause an accident that sends her car into the grave of Sarah Fier, touching her bones and bringing the witch and every killer she has inspired after her, demanding to taste her blood.Director Leigh Janiak made Honeymoon and some episodes of the series Outcast, Panic and Scream: The TV Series, but this film points to her as being a director to watch. She also worked on the script along with Kyle Killen (The Beaver) and Phil Graziadei (who wrote Honeymoon).I was pretty impressed with the intensity of this film, which I did not expect, much less its casual attitude toward drugs and how matter of fact the love story not being straight is. In short, this whole movie was a pleasant surprise for me, particularly how much you care for its characters, which makes the outright massacre of several of them to actually be quite shocking. If you liked Intruder, well, it seems like the makers of this movie did as well.Fear Street Part Two: 1978 and Fear Street Part Three: 1666 will follow this month and I'll be there for both of them.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
9,Calicodreamin,"Good effects, okay storyline",6,2 July 2021,"For a slasher film it kind of worked, the effects were good and there was a decent range of murders. Though there was a definite lull in the action about midway to almost the end. The storyline was okay, set up the characters and the history but it just felt lacking and a bit stretched. The acting was decent, but some super lame dialogue sprinkled throughout. Overall decent, I'll tune in to the next part.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
10,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Spectacularly fun if slightly flawed mainstream genre effort,9,10 July 2021,"After a series of strange attacks, a group of friends comes to believe that a centuries-old witch's curse has affected them with a multitude of resurrected killers affecting them and the rest of the town, forcing them to uncover the secrets of the curse to stop the series of murders from continuing.There was a lot to like with this one. One of the strongest elements here is the fun, slick energy that runs rampant throughout here that brings about a highly enjoyable atmosphere of the time period. The edgy attitudes, bright colors, and small-town vides that run throughout here with the fantastic appearance and presentation of the town at that time that gives off a completely immersive feeling that goes alongside their constant references and call-backs to the past tragedies in the town. This manages to effectively mix together an old-school feel involving the rebirth of the witch's curse and how it affects the group, tying together the past tragedies and mass murders as the continuing influence she has over the town. As well, that manages to highlight the film's enjoyably complex and involving storyline that enables the mixing of elements to come together. The aspects of the curse that they discover, including the particular method of doing so that the individual performs unknowingly the whole time and how the various past tragedies have affected their lives by encountering the multiple killers throughout the film, all come off incredibly well. The series of discoveries made about the nature of the witch and how they can battle it to save themselves and their friendship is a great addition to it all, bringing together a modern-day take on a centuries-old witchcraft curse that requires them to perform some rather unbelievable actions to take place. This keeps the film rolling along nicely throughout its running time. Lastly, there's a lot to like here regarding the stylish stalking scenes that are utilized throughout here. The spectacular opening at the mall involving the massacre of the workers there through the store provides an impressive beginning that focuses rather nicely on the stalking of the masked killer throughout the confined spaces. The series of stalking scenes involving the killer appearing at their houses and stalking them throughout the town offers up some chilling moments since they don't know what's going on, and the setup is prepared for its two major stalking scenes n the hospital or the fantastic encounter with the multiple reanimated killers at the school that leads into the fun finale at the grocery store which is fun, gory and over-the-top in the best way. These elements really hold this one up over its few flaws as there really isn't much really wrong with this one. One of the few drawbacks to be had here is the fact that, by being the first one in the series but referencing other events in the past line of tragedies, a lot of the film feels like the intention was to world-build but it ends up spoiling large sections of other films. That the towns' past tragedies are acknowledged in quite explicit manners is rather unusual. As well, the other big factor here is the overlong finale that goes on way too long for its own good setting up the next entries in the series rather than focusing on trying to wrap up its own storylines so it's quite dragging at a point that it doesn't need to be. These factors end up bringing this one down.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, sexual activity, and drug use.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
11,siderite,I couldn't keep watching it,6,29 July 2021,"I wanted to like the film. The girls are beautiful, it's an R. Stine R rated adaptation, it's a trilogy. I really wanted to be entertained for five hours. However the film just felt... dumb. I couldn't take another ""stupid kids in the 90s"" story, I couldn't care less about the rivalry between the two neighboring towns, but at least I expected something terrifying or fantastic or interesting or intelligent. Instead I watch half a movie as people dressed in a death costume stalk people, stab them out of nowhere, while said people believe it's a joke or someone they have some beef with fooling around. Because, get this, the town is called Murder Capital USA by the media, but NO ONE expects to be murdered and there is only one sheriff for the entire town. No, it was too stupid and the prospect of watching not only the other half of the movie, but two more that do the same thing, was too painful to contemplate.Bottom line: perhaps other people might enjoy it. I found it boring and anachronistic, mixing 1990 dumbassery with modern LGBTQ ideas, because why not, but otherwise being nor scary nor funny.I looked up the books and they are almost uniformly 4/5 stars, although they seem to have twists and a clear history of why the people in that area behave the way they do and so on. Perhaps reading the books it's a better idea.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
12,Cineanalyst,Hacky,3,6 July 2021,"Kiddies deserve originality, too. Hard to believe something such as this young-adult-fiction, ""Goosebumps""-type slop is written and filmed for an older audience than were Lewis Carroll's Alice books. No wonder nobody reads anymore when they're raised on this derivative emptiness. It's merely let's imitate other horror fiction, but remove any of the complicated mature stuff that might challenge readers and viewers and replace it with nothing. ""Scream"" (1996) without having to worry that you haven't seen this or that other horror movie that it's referencing. Instead, it's as though the filmmakers literally brought out their production-meeting crazy board mapping out their franchise and picked a character at random to serve as their in-movie surrogate to explain it to the other characters. Y'know, the role of film buff Randy Meeks (Jaimie Kennedy) in the Scream series. Interesting marketing strategy by the producers and Netflix, I suppose, especially since they're releasing the trilogy within a three weeks span, but it doesn't seem to actually make the cinematic-universe building interesting. And no wonder, too, that nobody watches non-tentpole franchise installments anymore when Rotten Tomatoes is certifying fresh this junk with a some 86% score.One horror series, however, where I found this sort of in-house referencing to work--because everything is the next Marvel Cinematic Universe nowadays, I guess--was ""The Conjuring"" movies, especially ""The Conjuring 2"" (2016). That's because it was still cinematically reflexive, but the characters were the filmmakers of the films-within-films rather than the ""Scream"" sort of meta-ness of referring to other movies outside of its diegesis.Besides ""Scream"" and ""The Conjuring,"" we get ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012) light treatment of multiple generic slasher-film monsters to chase the teenagers around. They're such annoying teens, too, that one just hopes their deaths will be gruesome. Too many lazy writers these days passing off characters yelling at each other as supposed character development. Maybe reality shows are to blame--I don't know. And, I'm guessing that the division of the towns between ""Shadyville"" and ""Sunnyvale"" (real subtle there) is going to mean something in the sequels, because all the exposition going into that here turns out to be a huge waste of time as far as goes this first movie's narrative. Plus, boy, is that hackneyed, too. It seems as though every bit of young adult fiction features these thinly-symbolic blatant class structures that temps one to hit their head against a wall. Always the romantic couple are from different sides of the tracks. Blame ""Animal Farm"" and ""Romeo and Juliet"" maybe, but we got the same such thing in The Hunger Games series, the Divergent ones, ""Alita: Battle Angel"" (2019), etc. This is the first one I recall seeing where the couple are lesbians, and the changing-clothes episode may be a bit steamier than usual, but that's about it.The best part--maybe the only promising thing here--is the opening sequence and in particular the girl working in a bookstore. It's Drew Barrymore's role in ""Scream,"" but with books instead of movies. It's brief, and the filmmakers don't even sustain the reflexivity throughout the sequence, let alone the rest of the movie, but it's an apt beginning for a movie based on a book series to be full of other books--perhaps including some of those that it rips-off, or rather rip-off those that imitated them in the first place. A copy of a copy. I'm not sure, because that's a hard book to read, but Jean Baudrillard may've been right... or was that Chuck Palahniuk.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

14,Thanos_Alfie,Very good start...,6,3 October 2021,"""Fear Street: 1994"" is a Mystery - Horror movie and the first movie of the ""Fear Street"" franchise, in which we watch a group of teenage friends trying to solve a mystery behind a series of brutal murders that frighten Shadyside for more than 300 years.I enjoyed this movie because it had a very interesting and mysterious plot. The only think that I did not like were the unnecessary jump-scares but thankfully were very few so, they did not ruined the image of the movie. The direction which was made by Leigh Janiak was very good and she presented her main characters very well along with their history. In addition to this, she did an excellent job on the way she connected the history of Shadyside with the present time. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, Kiana Madeira who played as Deena, Benjamin Flores Jr. Who played as Josh, Julia Rehwald who played as Kate, Olivia Scott Welch who played as Samantha Fraser and Fred Hechinger who played as Simon were very good and their combination as a team worked very well.

15,cruise01,"Fun, campy, and a cheesy slasher film that does not take itself seriously.",9,16 August 2021,"4.5 out of 5 stars.Fear Street 1994 is a really good slasher teen thriller that is based on R. L. Stine books. About a witch that possesses and have people become killers. While a group of teens are trying to figure out a connection to stop it.Interesting and good plot. Sure, the film does leave questions open for a sequel. About a witch cursing anyone who it gets near. The film opens up great. Maya Hawke closing her store at the mall while a killer lurks and chases her. Then, it follows Deena (Kiana Madeira) who is in a difficult relationship with Samantha (Olivia Scott Welch). While a killer is on the loose and after them.The film is campy. It does have its cheesy acting direction. Which is not taking itself seriously. Especially during the beginning of the third act. Where a group of teens take refuge at a high school. Waiting for the killers to show up. While a couple of them decide to have sex. Teens having sex before a blood bath in a slasher film can be checked off for the genre. You can guess on what happens next after that.The film is not scary. It is fun and it is thrilling. The cast ensemble is good with there performances. Kiana Madeira did great.The soundtrack is awesome. The script and direction is fast paced. The climax can be a bit blood shed with the characters. The ending does end for a sequel. And plus a mid credit teaser of the sequel.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
16,eddie_baggins,A fun enough Scream-like horror,6,11 July 2021,"The first instalment of a 3-part feature series that will be released on Netflix over the period of three weeks, Fear Street Part 1: 1994 is an entertaining enough start to Leigh Janiak's R. L Stine adaptation, one that turns the famous teen horror authors work into a more bloodthirsty Scream-lite genre entry that might not exactly provide much in the way of pure scares but gets by easily enough with some charm and smarts found in its familiar set-up.Opening with one of the most blatant Scream homages you're likely to witness, from the get go its abundantly clear that Janiak isn't going to hold back and doesn't intend to stay overly faithful to R. L Stine's original works with 1994 quickly establishing itself as an event aimed at a more mature audience than one might've initially suspected, with the future instalments set in the 70's and way back in the 1600's likely to be even more gruesome and hopefully terrifying than this teen orientated slasher.Loading up with 90's throwbacks in its early stages with a constant stream of music hits, mall set-pieces and old school computers, 1994 feels rather generic in its opening stages as Kiana Madeira's permanently angry face sporting Deena and her friends begin to discover more about the dark history of their town of Shadyside in the wake of a recent mass murder that upon closer investigation doesn't appear to entirely human in nature but after a little while spent building up to it 1994 finds its own groove and energy that many other Netflix originals fail to capture.With a wicked sense of humor and a feeling that anyone is fair game when it comes to the murderous forces running rampant through the cursed township, 1994 becomes a fun if undoubtedly silly horror ride that could've benefited from more effective scares to go along with the gore and comedic relief as well as a more engaging bunch of teens that the likes of Scream and Netflix's king horror property Stranger Things have in abundance.Unable to really attach us to Deena who is too grouchy for her own good and not giving enough room for supports from the likes of Olivia Scott Welch's Samantha, Benjamin Flores Jr's Josh or Fred Hechinger's Simon to shine in any significant way, one can only hope that as we progress through the next two instalments of this promising if superficial series we get some characters really worth rooting for as they battle to stay alive in Shadyside's murder happy landscape.Final Say -Far more fun that it had any right to be, Fear Street Part 1: 1994 is an enjoyable 90's throwback that wears its Scream sleeve (and mask) proudly for all too see and while it would've been nice to have more engaging characters and scares, this is a solid jumping off point for the future instalments.3 bread slicers out of 5.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

20,southdavid,I know what you did thirty years ago.,7,9 July 2021,"Slightly underwhelming score at the moment (6.2) for a film that I enjoyed a lot. Dragged in by the idea that RL Stine was involved, I really liked the first ""Goosebumps"" movie, I found a movie that homaged the 1990's both on screen, and with the type of movie it was.Two neighbouring towns, the preppy and upmarket Sunnyvale and the underprivaliged rundown Shadyside exist in Ohio. Shadyside is the Murder capital of the USA, with a string of spree and serial killings going back centuries. Deena (Kiana Madeira) is distraught that her girlfriend Sam (Oliver Scott Welch) has moved Sunnyvale and seemingly started a new life. Their argument comes to a head when, following a sporting event between the towns, a traffic accident bonds Sam to a long-burned witch, buried in the nearby forest. A host of killers then target Sam, Deena and their friends.""Scream"" really is a touch point for the film, both in terms of tone, as the film would fit well with the sensibilities of the teen slasher/horror films of the film, but also in terms of it's key opening scene - which to talk about any further would require me to use the spoiler function. That film, and also ""The Faculty"" were two that entered my mind whilst watching ""Fear Street"". Despite RL Stine's involvement, as with his source novels, it's definitely a step or two up the age ladder from the ""Goosebumps"" books. There are several gory deaths, as well as scenes of drug taking, sex and swearing. I really like that the film is part of a confirmed trilogy, that allows the film to develop some of the wider story of the town and will let us see characters interplaying across the trilogy.Performances are generally pretty good, with only really Fred Hechinger's Simon being a little too eccentric to match the tone of the rest of the characters. I really enjoyed the music - I'm in my forties too, so a lot of them were nostalgia bursts for me.Given that it's heavy on nostalgia, it's not particularly original - and none of the killers in the film are desperately new or memorable. Hopefully that will be something resolved with us revisiting the characters in the sequel/prequels. I'm looking forward to watching part two this weekend.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

22,subxerogravity,I like what I saw. i think its a good horror movie.,7,3 July 2021,"I was looking forward to this because I'm not only familiar with the book series but I read a few. It was not the first book I ever read but I think it was the first that did not have a title that started Little Miss or rhymed Cat with Hat.Any skepticism I had for the movie slowly disappeared with the first death that proved this was going to be a real horror movie.I was a little afraid with the constant 90s references made with the musical score. It's called Fear Street 1994 but I'm guessing they were not expecting people who were the age of the demographic for this flick in 1994 to be watching it, even though these books go back to like 1989 or something right? Some of the musical choices had not even happen in 1994 and when that happen I could not help to raise an eye brown cause the movie is trying to set a place in time with the music alone and being annoyingly vague on the 90s.I assume this is a small pet peeve just for me and maybe others who where teens in the 90s, After all, when the second movie 1978 comes out I'm not gonna care about this.It's a small pet peeve in comparison to the overall movie which was a great horror film. What it has going for it is that you start to care for the victims, which as disturbing as it sounds makes the death scenes even better.Fear Street was able give you everything you'd expect from a Slasher movie and then add some depth to it that I thought I would not get from this film but they gave it to me.Nice!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
23,jtindahouse,"Good start, before becoming very dull",5,5 July 2021,"I grew up on R. L. Stine books. It was mostly the Goosebumps series I read, however I would dabble in the Fear Street series occasionally too. I've tried to go back and read them again as an adult but found them far too simple and aimed at children (which of course was always the idea). Fear Street is a little different though. It's more of a stepping stone between children's horror and adult horror. I was very pleased to see that these movies were going to get an R rating. Sadly though, they mostly wasted it.The opening scene in this film was actually very well done. It gave some real 'Scream' vibes - something I read was intentional - and had me gripped and wanting more. From there unfortunately the film falls apart a little. Once it delves heavily into the supernatural it becomes a lot less interesting. I had known this would be the case going in, but just because a film is heavily supernatural doesn't always have to be a death sentence. On this occasion it was.It's a brave thing for a movie to have its leads all be youths. There are very few adults in this movie and they are all very much side characters. For teenagers the lead cast did a respectable job. They didn't annoy me too much and they had some layers to them.I just found the whole film very bland. There was stuff going on, but the stakes weren't high enough. There's two more of these films coming out over the next fortnight, and I'll likely give them a chance. But I do hope they take a bit of a change of direction.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
24,jadavix,Catnip for '90s fanpeople,7,7 September 2021,"Despite the R. L. Stine referencing title, ""Fear Street: 1994"" is more indebted to the Scream movies than to anything Stine put his name to. Perhaps they only used the name ""Fear Street"" to further increase the number of references to the '90s decade.And boy, is it loaded with those. Well, mostly they're references of the musical variety. I don't think the soundtrack ever plays a song for longer than a minute, possibly due to the fact that it just has so many songs. They're really trying to ram the nostalgia home here. Besides that there's AOL chat and 16 bit video games, but I didn't notice much that really reminded me of that stupidly lionised decade.The movie starts as a ""Scream"" clone, even beginning with a false start like that movie did, but then adds some strange supernatural mumbo jumbo about a witch bringing killers back from the dead. I didn't really follow the story. It seemed needlessly complex.This movie was an okay time-waster, but it didn't really hold my attention.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The plot of slasher serial killers, the supernatural and witchcraft makes for an interesting idea and I do look forward to the next two parts. Set in 1994 the film has a great soundtrack, sadly some of the songs have very brief plays and it beggars belief why they would include tracks that weren't released until a few years later.

This movie is directed by Leigh Janiak (Honeymoon) and stars Kiana Madeira (The Flash), Olivia Scott Welch (Shithouse), Benjamin Flores Jr (Ride Along) and Julia Rehwald (Where's Daren). The storyline for this is so poorly written it made my head hurt. The film tries really hard to have a coming of age feel to it like The Faculty, Stranger Things, etc but falls short due to poor writing. The film has no parents, teachers and one detective...but no police. You have tremendous deaths and great kills...then no police, no interviews, hell there's a crazy good bus scene, but no concerned bus driver? Really? The film focuses on special effects to try making up for the pathetic writing but it didn't work for me. RL Stine deserves credit for a great premise, but the screenplay writers did this film no favors. I know I'm probably in the minority on this one, but I'd score this a 4/10.

35,aidanratesmovies,"Decent start, but definitely could have been better",7,2 July 2021,"Feeling like a brisk combination of Stranger Things and American Horror Story, Netflix starts out its horror trilogy with an entertaining and decent- but somewhat lacking start. I enjoyed the film for what it was. I found it entertaining from beginning to end, it isn't scary per say, but it is very tense to watch- and I often found myself on the edge of my seat. All the actors do their best, but many of the characters feel a bit generic and seem to serve no purpose other than to fill in the character gap needed in their story structure. I enjoyed Julia Rehwald performance the most, simply because I felt she didn't force the obvious attributes of her character, and made it something at least somewhat unique. I'm glad the film decided to go with its gay character narrative between Deena and Samantha- but elements of it feel rather forced at time- and often take away from the tension of the film, only to be replaced with melodrama. Thankfully the film is good at making you care for the characters at hand, you feel connected with them, even if you may not like them personally- although it's formulaic tendencies can often take away from a potentially greater impact. There are quite a few cliches throughout, and I feel the story wasn't taken full advantage of, and instead skimmed through. The film looks fine, but feels a bit too on the nose with its 90's references and cheap nostalgia at times. The costumes are incredibly well done though and I enjoyed the look of the menacing does throughout. In the end, Fear Street Part One has its messy elements, but thankfully still manages to be an exciting film- even if it isn't as special as it could have been.My Rating: 7.2/10.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

It doesn't really do anything special, but for that sacrifice they do 3-4 parallel arcs.For slasher fans, there is a lot of fun here, and the bodies hit the floor all over in a spectacular fashion.Really trying not to spoil anything, I can only point to a handful of features where there are multiple survival situations in play at once.

37,vengeance20,Poor Imitation Of Other Slashers,3,12 August 2021,"Heard about this film, but didn't get around to watching til today. I thought it looked good & decided to give it a watch.The film looked like it would be good, but boy were my expectations thrashed after watching.The film follows a group of teens stalked by a skull masked killer who believe it or not, is possessed by some witch who possessed numerous people over the past century or so also turning them into killers & murder people like what the skull killer is doing to them. They must then find a way to stop the killer & put an end to the curse.I don't know where to start, but for one, the film didn't feel 90's esque whatsoever. It felt like a modern day film trying to be a 90's film. The songs in the film were (mostly) all after the year '94 which in itself along with the failure to make the film feel like the 90's, a major balls up. The attitudes in the film didn't reflect the 90's at all, I wasn't feeling anything, sorry not sorry, but if you're going to do a 90's film then it has to be true to that era not a 90's film with modern actions etc. It's the like the film wanted to be both which made little to no sense.The film itself was way too wacky & all over the place for my tastes. When I want to watch a slasher, I want it to be real to life & grounded in reality. Like with Scream, its sequels & other slashers this paroadies for example which didn't feature any supernatural crap in it & was normal/straight forward... The deaths were little to none despite being gory. I want back to back kills & less talk & story.The films pace/runtime was terrible also. Too much talking, whining & dragging of scenes which could've just got to the damn point in less than a minute or so. Hate that. Also, the poor treatment of the specific male characters was apparent from the start, well done...Overall, this is a poor attempt at doing something nostalgic to the 90's but finding it hard to do so without ruining it, while writing & making a poor attempt to do something different & screwing it up in the process.3/10.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

40,arungeorge13,This had absolutely no right to be so entertaining! [+65%],7,5 July 2021,"Fear Street Part One: 1994, the first in a film trilogy based on R. L Stine's books, is such a fun little '90s throwback slasher. Writer-director Leigh Janiak displays considerable command over the source material, all the while offering splendid visuals coupled with a terrific soundtrack. How it differs from other horror franchises is in the fact that it was designed to be a trilogy from the get-go (and not just because the first film is a success!). The towns of Shadyside and Sunnyvale are polar opposites. One's riddled with crimes of a psychopathic nature while the other's been violent-crime-free for a long time.Deena (Kiana Madeira), a Shadyside resident is struggling to come to terms with her break-up with her lesbian lover Samantha (Olivia Scott Welch) who has since moved to Sunnyvale. While this is the film's core emotional thread, it's the mystery (and the history) behind the murders that forms the major plot thread. Deena's nerdy, AOL chat-enthusiast brother Josh (Benjamin Flores Jr.) and her drug-dealing pals Kate (Julia Rehwald) and Simon (Fred Hechinger) make up the rest of the quirky ensemble. It starts off with a sequence that looks and feels straight out of Scream - one that'd make the late Wes Craven proud. There's also this dreamy quality to the film's visuals which are accentuated by the use of artificial lighting - say neons, or even a vehicle's headlights.The period-accurate nature of the film's aesthetics, as a 90s-born, was impressive. We get older brand logos, mixtapes, chatrooms, and more that define a glorious generation (sorry, I'm biased!). Closeted love was never in the forefront of horror movies of the 80s or 90s. The depiction of Sam and Deena's relationship isn't shoved in just for the sake of representation, however. With carefully written scenes, Janiak proves, without a doubt, how queer romance is delightfully organic. The occult element is one that binds the 3 films, and it'd be interesting to see if the other two can maintain the same momentum. That tease at the end did get me excited, I must say!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

43,IonicBreezeMachine,An intriguing first part in the Fear Street trilogy that works as an homage to 90s era Slashers without going too reference heavy.,7,3 July 2021,"Set in the town of Shadyside, Ohio, the community once again deals with fallout from a mass murder spurring exacerbating tensions with Shadyside's affluent neighbor Sunnyvale. Deena (Kiana Madeira) harbors lingering resentments towards her ex, Sam (Olivia Scott Welch) for leaving Shadyside for Sunnyvale following her parents divorce. After an altercation between Shadyside students and Sunnyvale students causes an accident that hospitalizes Sam, Deena's brother Josh (Benjamin Flores Jr.) and her friends Kate (Julia Rehwald) and Simon (Fred Hechinger) start seeing appearances of someone wearing the costume of the of the killer from the recent murder spree, the group initially writes it off as a sick joke from Sunnyvale, but as the group digs deeper they find the murders are rooted in a far greater evil.Initially running in publication from 1989 to 1995, Fear Street was R. L. Stine's first major series of books actually predating Goosebumps. While R. L. Stine is more known for younger skewing material such as Goosebumps, the Fear Street series is noted for higher intensity in comparison to the Goosebumps books often with more explicit character deaths and aimed at an older audience. Development on an adaptation of the series has been in various fits and starts with both a 1 hour drama by CBS and a ""Scream"" inspired R-rated take on the material by Disney's Hollywood Pictures both getting stalled early on in development, and save for a scrapped pilot for the younger skewing Ghosts of Fear Street airing on ABC in the late 90s the series didn't have any serious development until 2015 when Chernin Entertainment bought the rights and in an unprecedented move shot a trilogy of films back-to-back with the intention of releasing them over the course of a single Summer one month apart. When Disney bought Fox the series was still intended to be released in the Summer of 2020 but with the pandemic making theatrical outlets unavailable Disney then sold the trilogy to Netflix. With it's long tumultuous journey to release now over, I can say that Fear Street is very much worth the wait.The series is directed by first time feature director Leigh Janiak whose previous experience in directing can be seen in the Robert Kirkman Cinemax series Outcast, as well as the MTV Scream TV series. Janiak's direction is solid and she does a good job of bringing the town of Shadyside to life and incorporates the 90s aesthetic to good effect without going to overboard on the period references as nostalgia traps like Ready Player One have fallen into. From the costuming to the camera angles the movie is clearly inspired by the likes of many slasher films from classics like Halloween and Scream to more obscure ones like Intruder or Visiting Hours. The environments of Shadyside are really well done with the town itself portrayed as a festering rat hole that is kept in a state of almost living death makes for some great atmosphere.The characters are more or less your standard types for this kind of film with Deanna being the ""outsider"". Josh being the ""nerd"", Simon the ""Funny one"", Kate the ""outgoing one""(to a point), and Sam as the ""princess"". Basically the group are the Breakfast Club if you were to have a bunch of knife and axe wielding maniacs run after them, which I'm perfectly okay with. Unlike a lot of contemporary slasher movies Fear Street dials back the trend of having most of the characters be hate sinks so you want them to die and actually makes the characters likable and endearing, this does create a bit of an issue story wise in that there's a middle section where no characters die and I feel like maybe they should've had one or two more characters to be sacrificial lambs so the movie could play with the balance of the character dynamics a bit more. The story itself is very heavy with lore and internal mythology that's clearly meant to be set up and paid off in the sequels but the movie never gets too bogged down in its details and allows the audience to enjoy the film on its own merits.Fear Street 1994 is a promising start to the trilogy. With good cinematography, likable characters, and a fleshed out premise the movie creates a fun homage to the slasher genre without going too far into parody or reference overload. While the movie's intended nature as a trilogy means there's a lot of dangling plot threads left hanging, on the basis of this first film I'm curious enough to see where they lead.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
44,gedikreverdi,An enticingly beautiful slasher,7,3 July 2021,"It was funny, gore and paced and scary at times. What else do we need from a slasher? Set in 1994 in a poor town Shadyside with the neighboring rich town Sunnyvale. The opening scene was obviously an homage to the opening scene of Scream. The bookstore employee girl got killed in the mall at night by another employee in another store and he did it in a skull mask. He was the latest slave of Sarah Fier who was executed in town back in 1666 because she was a witch. She put curse on people in Shadyside and make them killers. Deena and his witch nerd brother Josh live in the same house and deena was sad because her closeted girlfriend Sam moved to Sunnyvale. Returning from the vigil in Sunnyvale, Deena threw the cooler on the tailgating car behind them. They were the rich bullies and Sam was in the car too. The car swerved and Deena caused an accident. Sam's blood dripped on the bones of the witch which was under a tree by the road. And the killers the skull, the camp killer, the sexy woman were all coming for Sam. After being stalked by a skull mask man, Deena and other went to the hospital to ask Sam to make his bully boyfriend stop it. But it wasn't him and he became one of the victims along with others at the hospital. They drove away with the ambulance and buried the bones of the witch when they found them but it didn't work. They exploded them in the school when they trapped them, their slimy black blobs morphed into the killers back again. The explosion scene was great. Then the witch nerd josh found out the sole survivor from the camping site was a woman who died and was brought back by the doctors. Deena drowned his girlfriend in the fish tank at a grocery store and the killers disappeared before one of them killed his brother. But Kate whom josh was in love and Simon whom was enchanted by the sexy killer were killed. Kate's killing was awesome. She was put through the shredder by the skull mask killer. They pinned the murders on junkies Kate and Simon and the sole survivor from the campsite called saying it's not over and Sam transformed into a killer attacking Deena. Deena strapped her down to find a way to make her herself back again.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
45,hnt_dnl,Somewhat passable but generally weak,5,19 July 2021,"I already reviewed the Part 2 entry of the FEAR STREET series first because it was so good and I was so impressed that I didn't need time to think about how great it was. But for this first movie 1994, I needed some time to ruminate. First, it was really the greatness of 1978 that informed my general opinion that 1994 was much weaker. 1978 just had much better characters, writing, acting, atmosphere, transitions. Everything just worked.So I began to think why was 1994 inferior? First, in 1978, I thought that there was tons of chemistry between Cindy and Alice, the 2 best characters out of the entire trilogy, even though they were both heterosexual and had boyfriends. The just had that IT factor. But in 1994, ironically, even though Deena and Sam were a lesbian couple and in love, I felt zero chemistry between the actresses. While Cindy and Alice both had individual purpose and growth as well as actual chemistry, with Deena and Sam I felt that Deena did all the heavy lifting plot-wise while Sam was just the typically annoying damsel-in-distress.Then there is the overall group of characters. Now, 1994 had 5 generally OK characters in Deena, Sam, Josh, Kate, and Simon, but none of them really stood out to me as great. There was something forced in the writing and acting for all of them. There was almost this self-aware quality where the characters acted too much like they were in a parody of classic horror-slasher movies instead of just being in the moment.Then there's a disconnect between the characters I like and the general fans. I'm reading serious adoration for the Kate character and she just didn't impress me as much. She was OK, but she was also way too on the nose and in your face all the time. And I'm reading serious hate for Deena yet I found her to be pretty likable and persuasive, if a bit too loud. Then there's Josh who was basically just a exposition dump character who magically knew everything about Shadyside's history and can just pump out exact details at the snap of a finger and figure stuff out without any effort. Plus, he was probably the worst acted character of the group. The 2 characters I can agree with fans on are Sam and Simon for different reasons. I definitely think Sam was annoying and just a plot device, while Simon was probably my favorite character by the end of the movie. Generally, the characters were too ""I'm in a horror movie so let me act like it.""Another issue was the setting. At times, it didn't feel like the 90s to me. It almost could have been set in the present. And going back to the 1978 comparison, there were a slew of great and memorable characters in that movie, while in 1994 in addition to having 5 not-so-great main characters, the supporting cast was pretty forgettable.Finally, there were the forced interactions. I already spoke to the complete lack of chemistry between Deena and Sam. Why were the characters yelling their dialogue at each other? Just talk in a normal voice. Deena and Josh had no believable sibling chemistry. How are Kate and Simon even friends? So they're just 2 random yet likable drug dealers? The Kate and Josh thing was incredibly disingenuous and forced. I did not for one second believe that Kate would just fall in love with Josh for seemingly no reason whatsoever other than he was around all the time and staring at her like a creeper. Plus, wasn't she like a senior and he was only a freshman? Seems a tad inappropriate on top of the lack of chemistry.The few things the movie had going for it were the great opening Scream homage mall scene, the scary group of zombified killers, the 90s music, the gory kills and special effects, and the interesting backstory of Shadyside's history that was dug deeper in the better later 2 entries of the trilogy.

52,AhmedSpielberg99,Can't wait for the even more messy and gruesome 70s horror!,7,3 July 2021,"With a masked killer and piled-up dead bodies spurting buckets galore of blood, the first installment in the trilogy that will be released weekly over the course of July screams at you that it will be crammed with 90's slasher sub-genre tropes to the hilt. And it is. The story zeros in on a group of teens living in a the town of Shadyside, which is in a feud with the neighboring town of Sunnyvale, with an advantage to the latter due to the stigma that surrounds Shadyside for being notorious for a bloodstained history of murders. The plot takes ages to actually kick off, as I think the movie got carried away quite a bit in laying out its 90s-inspired setting. Our teenage heroes are: Deena (Kiana Madeira), who, despite witnessing an accident, spends a big chunk of the movie in denial of the real threat, underestimating it and regarding it as a series of pranks. Her brother, Josh (Benjamin Flores Jr.), is a nerd, internet-obsessed introvert who's a firm believer that what happens in the town is an entailment of darker secrets. Accordingly, he spends his time tracing the murders over the history, attempting to put the pieces together. Additionally, there are Kate (Julia Rehwald) and Simon (Fred Hechinger), classmates who serve as the comic relief characters at first before the story takes a darker, more earnest turn in its second half. Things improves significantly from there onwards. We finally get a glimpse at the lore the other two parts would expand on. But it's how the film unfolds is what impressed me for it somewhat managed to dodge the traps similar films that try to capture the characteristic features of a genre in a certain era it pays an homage to fall into: either ending up being a mere flimsy imitation of the movies in question or a self-serious film that tries too hard to keep things on a light footing.First, I think it's a pretty smart decision that of taking a seamless diversion in its general tone from a full-on cheesy horror flick to a more serious and more dramatically hefty one while keeping on the campiness with no skimping on jump scares, juicy blood splatter, rapid zoom-ins, to name a few, to the last minute, as well as occult and possession (sorta!!) elements, which are even at the core of the plot. That's not to mention a plethora of references to classic horror films such as Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead and Jaws, as well as an allusion to The Shining and the door-breaking axe scene, but that's beside the point, anyway. Secondly, and as faithful to the 90s era as it is, the movie doesn't shy away from borrowing the distinct Stranger Things-approach that has been the go to for any film lately that tries to balance out the dread of horror films with a nostalgic flavor, the thing that also, somehow, heightens the intense spooky moments and renders them quite unsettling, due to the discordance between the warm ambiance - that of nostalgia - that prevails the scene and the gory, shocking happenings that penetrate it. Finally, in its exploration of the mythology, the movie clearly takes a page or two from the modern horror films that revived the genre in the recent years. However, with the exception of some twists, the story is very predictable and also has a formulaic structure. And one could see how the arcs of the characters would wind up from a mile. To end on a positive note, the soundtrack is chock-full of cool, adeptly implemented needle drops. Can't wait for the even more messy and gruesome 70s horror!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
53,kuarinofu,So Fear Street is a sapphic flick now,6,5 July 2021,"Fear Street/1994 is not a bad film, it's just unfocused and thus feels directionless. Maybe it will sink in better after the trilogy will be concluded. The biggest thing taking me out of the film was the tone, at the one hand we got a decent slasher film with pleasant gore, but on the other hand, it's younger kids (or rather indistinguishable in terms of age) swearing left and right and acting real tough. Also, a lot of screen time is dedicated to a lesbian love story, which in the end didn't feel that rewarding.The 1994 part was mostly reflective of the Scream era slashers, at least for the first 20 minutes or so, but again, the characters should've been older. The ending sneak peek suggests that the second part would be Friday the 13-like, hope they won't mess up that one (yet they have already spoiled its ending in this one).The 90ties are different for everyone, and if you dig deeper into this aspect, you will surely find lots of inconsistencies. It would've felt more natural if they didn't overstuff the first half with lots of popular songs (and yeah, Firestarter is definitely not 1994, and Calibri font is way far from Windows NT 3.5, see I'm doing it now).The film would've been much better if they had an actual mystery and way more gore (which was done well, but I'd love to have more of it).I'm ok with R. L. Stine being done this way, it's different, but still made with care. A more trashy and exploitative approach would've improved this.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
54,Movi3DO,Decent,6,3 July 2021,"So Halloween came four months early I guess.The first part of the Fear Street trilogy on Netflix is here. After a series of brutal slayings, a teen and her friends take on an evil force that's plagued their notorious town for centuries.I'm not sure why this movie is released in July, but the trilogy definitely belongs to typical Halloween movies. The design of the title, the atmosphere, the looks of the killers, and the costumes all screamed this fact. The best part about this was the decent amount of gore and violence. If you want to see a bunch of people getting killed, this one will be pretty fun.The premise, even though not anything new, did a fine job setting up the trilogy. However, there were still some unexpected moments that made the story exciting. After the movie, I became curious how the next two movies would explain the lore even more, which is a good thing.The teen drama in this movie not only was cheesy, but also annoyed me. The main character's clinging and aggressive behavior at the beginning was stupid. The rest of the characters were pretty much all straightforward and stereotypical teens. Because of this, even though the story was decent, I couldn't enjoy it as much.Also, as a horror, it didn't really scare me one bit. Some scenes were a little intense, but I only enjoyed them if there were gore.Overall, a decent Halloween movie that did its job setting up the trilogy. 6/10.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The main character she didn't even care her best friends died. The bucket of blood. Where did they get it? Terrible movie. Just a cliche. The only thing that wasn't cliche was the fact that the main character Deena, is entirely unlikable. Little to no redeemable qualities. Entirely happy to sacrifice her 2 friends for her unhealthy romantic obsession. The ending looked for a moment like it could redeem the movie, when Sam stabbed Deena.,except Deena lived.

57,jp_91,A retro style for 2021.,8,18 July 2021,"""Fear Street: 1994"" is a good film loosely based on R. L. Stine's books, for the first time this writer work is adapted into a film with bloody violence, soft nudity, a bit of sex and drug use. His previous works adapted for television were childish and even the films based on ""Goosebumps"" were very soft as well as his novels, but now Stine's style has been reinvented and Netflix brought a refreshing story for the slasher subgenre, clearly influenced by horror classics. The best about the technical aspects are the well done cinematography, the special effects have a retro charm, the acting is good and the plot is interesting. The negative points fall on a costume design and an art direction that do not look very 90's, the atmosphere is quite modern although with a certain retro touch, this could be better. Appreciable movie for nostalgic people like me.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
58,SoumikBanerjee25,Off to a Disappointing Start...,6,17 July 2021,"Loads of Blood, Gruesome Kills, Stupid Teenagers; It brings me right back to the golden age of Horror. To tell you the truth; ever since I was a kid, I have been a staunch advocate of 'Slashers'; as they always used to provide a good deal of entertainment and some mindless fun without ever getting pretentious.Things aren't the same anymore. Mostly because, Horror films have come a long way, and let's be fair; they have gone through a large-scale revolution of their own. For the better, of course! Besides, Hollywood has lately been so ignorant of such 90's style undertakings as well. Luckily, we got Netflix; who came to our rescue and resuscitated the good ol' memories.That being said, the first piece of this three-part Trilogy starts on a relatively disappointing note. The story here might come off as an unambiguous one. As a matter of fact, it indeed is. However, there were several windows of opportunity for the creators to do things in different ways. It cannot be denied that they did make some legitimate attempts; but unfortunately, those efforts were all in vain. By and large, due to its lusterless script which ended up being rather jarring.In all honesty, Performances aren't that bad over here. Especially, when you compare this to the classics; where Acting was never the strongest suit. Hate to admit, the same cannot be said regarding the character arcs. Not having enough relatability or profound depth had adverse effects on an otherwise Interesting choice of ensemble. To put it bluntly, pretty much all the characters felt inconsequential and highly forgettable.For the most part, the positive takeaways primarily come from its technical side of things. Whether it be flamboyant use of dominant colors, apt inclusion of 90's signature tunes, or the delightful application of R-rated Graphic Violence; the pictorial representation, in other words, has been outstanding. Likely the reason behind my somewhat favorable assessment of it.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

First, the kid. You can't take seriously a slasher movie when one of the leaders is a kid. Second, the setting in the 90's is pretty unrealistic. Who had internet at home in the '94?So, overall just an OK movie. Not a slasher, not Sci-Fi,

It seems like it achieved everything it wanted to achieve, and it directly homages and references other movies that often get a pass for the same sins just because of the following they've fostered over the years. Objectively speaking, 1994 is not a good movie. It's clumsy, full of questionable dialogue, bad acting, and problematic character choices. And yet I can't say I'm not drawn in. I'm genuinely looking forward to 1978 on Friday, because I'm interested enough in the concept of the three movies, and the overarching story they're trying to tell. I want to see where it goes and how it all ties together. I may not even be able to accurately judge this movie until after the last one next week.

My main issue is that even though it's an R rated movie, it felt like a teens movie.The story of the witch is interesting but the characters are unlikable and stupid. Emotionally speaking this movie was way off. If you are being chased by killers you should act like your life is on the line. The characters are very immature. They care too much about the wrong things. What's more important, your life or your love life?Also, where is everybody? If there are two slashed bodies in the middle of a hospital reception room, chances are someone would notice and call the cops but apparently no one did because the cops didn't believe the teens and had to send someone to check their story. The cops were there just for show and parents were no where to be seen. Where are the parents of these kids? They are just running around town doing whatever they want. No one is interrupting them, no one is noticing the weird killers.It's watchable but it's very mediocre. Many reviewers complained there's no 90's feel to this movie but I was more annoyed that there was no attention to details and the characters all behaved very weirdly.I also don't understand why Netflix didn't release all three movies at the same time.

Overall rating 93/100Fear Street part 1: 1994 is about a circle of teenage friends who accidentally encounter the ancient evil responsible for a series of brutal murders that have plagued their town for over 300 years. Welcome to Shadyside. This was a fantastic film and one of the strongest slashers I have seen.My first few positives would be the opening scene, the fantastic cinematography, soundtrack and Jumpscares. The opening scene was just fantastic and set the type of tone this film was going for perfectly. It was intense, it was stylistically and visually creative. And the slasher tone and the feel of the film came across instantly, getting you invested and wanting more straight away. The cinematography, not just in the opening scene but in the whole film was excellent. The use of colour to represent how the characters were feeling or the danger they were in was excellently used. I loved the uses of Blue and Red especially. It made the film stand out and it was very creatively used. I also loved the soundtrack in this film. Some other critics could say it was overused, but for me it perfectly fit in with the tone perfectly and made the scenes so much more fun to watch. With loads of 90's pop culture references sprinkled throughout; it was a nice creative touch to the film for me. I also thought the Jumpscares were very effectively used. For me they weren't overused due to the focus on the tone and building tension. But when they were used, they were very effective and startling which helped increase the tension within each scene, they were sometimes predictable but nonetheless still effective.My next few positives would be the building of tension. The excellent slasher tone to the film, the fantastic humour as well as the great chemistry and performances from the cast. This movie-built tension excellently. With each scene the stakes were increased and the more you cared about the characters the mor intense it got. The film did an excellent job at spreading and building the tension evenly throughout and when it came to the final act it went all out. I absolutely loved the classic slasher feel to it. With the soundtrack and the excellent character design of the killers reminding me of scream, it bought back lots of nostalgic 90's slasher vibes whilst also balancing that out with feeling fresh as well. Also, with the great performances and over the top reactions and screams just made it that much more fun to watch. I also thought the cast did a fantastic job here. Everyone played their roles well, but key cast standouts for me where Kiana Madeira, Olivia Scott Welch, Benjamin Flores Jr and Maya Hawke. They bought the extra intensity and depth to there characters. But the whole cast had excellent chemistry with each other, it reminded me of stranger things with the group dynamic. I also think due to the casts chemistry the humour was excellent. There was some excellent comedic performances and timing from the actors, and they all bounced off each other in an organic and fun way.My next few positives would be the use of gore, the interesting dynamic to the killers. The LGBTQ + representation, the excellent plot twists as well as the development to the plot and mystery. I thought the use of gore was very effective, it made the scenes even more intense and gave them more impact. Some of the kills were very brutal and truly made it standout from some more teen and younger audience-based horrors, it gave that little bit more of a punch and was effectively used. I found it really interesting that the killers were revealed, it added an interesting and fairly fresh dynamic to the film. Instead of building a mystery around who the killers were it was much bigger than that. The plot developed really well, and the mystery was built excellently. They didn't disappoint with the reveals and the plot twists were excellently done, making you guess what was going on constantly which kept me entertained throughout. I also thought that the LGBTQ+ representation was refreshing and nice to see, having the two leads in a relationship and for to be explored properly and with depth throughout was nice to see, it was proper representation and not watered down or making them feel like token characters.My two negatives for the film would be the unexplained conflict, and the generic conflict and character motivations. I thought the conflict between the two neighbourhoods of Shadyside and Sunnyvale was slightly unexplored. It was never fully explained why both places hated each other so much and it felt like a missed opportunity and it came across as generic, and they only touched the surface with the conflict, making it come across as usual high school drama. My other negative would be that there was some generic conflict and character motivations. I felt like this made the film tonally off in places only because it felt more like a teen drama which I feel like most of the film was trying to differentiate itself from. And some of the character motivations and decisions did fall into some genre tropes that were frustrating in parts but mostly forgivable.My final few positives would be the worldbuilding, depth to the relationships, the fantastic final act. And the brilliant set up for the future instalments. I thought that the film had excellent worldbuilding. The different killers and the towns history were well explored and intriguing, they went into a good amount of detail into how everything was connected and therefore I was invested in the story and excited for the world to expand with the future instalments. I loved the depth that they added to the main characters relationship. It was all about accepting each other for who they were without fear of judgement from others, and the events that took place and risk of death to both of them only bought them closer, the movie didn't shy away from the themes they embraced it and therefore the characters grew and developed nicely with a satisfying character arc. The final act was incredible. At first It seemed like it was going to a simple and fun final act with a final battle, but it was much more than that. The stakes and tension were incredibly high, so much that you didn't know what was going to happen to the characters, and just when you thought it was the end they threw in another twist. This led to an unexpected and fresh set up for the next instalments that I didn't see coming, it was refreshing for them to seemingly end it in a positive way only for it to be flipped on its head.Overall, Fear Street part 1: 1994 is one of the strongest slashers in years. Serving as both a homage to previous slashers but also paving its own path and brand. With an intense, layered and visually stunning feast for the eyes, and despite me being nervous for the rest of the franchise due to this being so good and the film already revealing a lot about them, I am excited to see where this trilogy goes.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
79,aastikhimta,Below average,4,7 July 2021,Everything was on point in but after first half movie became a disaster. No jump scares no horror scenes. Expected alot but disappointed. Could've been better if the plot would be same like first half.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
80,Coffee_in_the_Clink,An R-rated Nickelodeon special,2,3 July 2021,"I was really looking forward to this movie. R. L Stine was my first taste of horror as a child. I worshipped his ""Goosebumps"" series. As I got older, I moved on the ""Fear Street"" books and his ""Point Horror"" contributions. Seeing this film advertised illicit such strong nostalgia in me. Unfortunately, it was a serious let down.After a strong opening where we see a young woman being stalked in a mall after closing time, followed by a superb intro montage of video clips and newspaper headlines detailing the history of Shadyville, I was settled back ready for what looked to be a real gem. But then the film got bogged down in every cliche going and became frustratingly lacklustre. We've seen it all before...""Fear Street"" attempts to pay homage to the slasher films of the '90s - such as Wes Craven's ""Scream"" - but ends up being a monotonous rip-off of such films. The acting for the most part is mediocre and there are a few overwrought performances. It has the feel of a Nickelodeon special gone R-Rated, and it just does not work. Can't say I am too excited for the next two installments. One bitterly disappointed horror and R. L. Stine fan here.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
81,jakethesnake-42007,Meh not good or bad,4,18 July 2021,This film could of been a lot more but it ultimately misses the mark. The film plays like a made for TV movie where not much happens but it really tries hard. The premise is good but the follow through with it is a let down. Has its moments of fun but it's not enough to really make it a good movie. The characters are also meh. The whole movie is just meh.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
82,CountJonnie,Good old fashioned horror,7,29 July 2021,"Decent horror slasher with some nice effects, a simple story although not completely predictable, some teens you can dislike.

83,bangel3322,Not as good as I'd hoped for,6,3 July 2021,"So....when I first heard about this movie series to say I was excited was an understatement. A wave of nostalgia hit me. I spent a majority of my childhood reading Fear Street and Point Horror books. I thought and still think R. L. Stine is a genius. These films took quite a while to come out with Covid setting them back, but I waited patiently and finally yesterday I sat down to watch the first film. I didn't watch any of the trailers and didn't even read the synopsis because I wanted to go in fresh without knowing the storyline. Ok, so firstly I like the idea behind this. Linking the films together throughout different times via this witch Sarah Fier. She possesses people to become killers. It's interesting. It's different. However, I personally would've liked to have seen them actually adapt stories from the books themselves. Fear Street books from my recollection usually all take place on a street called Fear Street. A weird house on Fear Street or someone goes missing on Fear Street, etc. The way the film plays out doesn't actually tie in with that. So it kind of negates the whole purpose of Fear Street. Secondly while the film has some good ideas running through it and some great scenes...it's lacking in intrigue and excitement. No exciting twists or surprises. So while it appears different on the surface, it felt like just another horror film. And even though it's 1hr 47mins, it felt like it was over quite quickly without having given me enough. I wanted more. But I guess that's where the other movies come in. So I'll wait until next week for the next instalment. At the end of this film we were given a preview of 1978 and it does look good. So see you next week!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

85,bazookamouth-221-898097,It was watchable but it didnt absorb my interest,5,10 July 2021,"As you probably gathered from the title, the film is set in 1994, so naturally roughly 10,000 needle drops on the soundtrack drive home that point because you're only allowed to listen to music from the year the movie is set. More importantly, nothing about Fear Street is scary, even though a couple of the kills are original and gruesome. Despite having a gay couple at the center of its story, the movie seems utterly uninterested in them as actual people outside of this relationship. The kids are types more than characters. Still, there's an energy to this chapter of Fear Street and it is atmospheric to a degree. 1994 left me wanting something more substantial than simply a Scream retread with a few more culturally sensitive touches.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

88,zac-04879,Great Slayings are Ruined by Flat Story,5,5 July 2021,"Fear Street: 1994 is an unexciting, unafraid, and an entirely predictable way to kick into an attractive slasher trilogy. Of course there's plenty of brutal bloody slayings for slasher fans, but that element is ruined by how slow the film is. It also leaves you uninterested for the next part, which hopefully will have improved.Fear Street is true slasher, but is pointless horror. It takes time to understand that accurate horror isn't violence and chasing. It makes all of the jump-scares completely predictable, but who doesn't enjoy some R. L. Stine style? This movie is decent to watch once, probably with a bunch of friends, but it's mostly unwatchable. That's what makes it an enormous let-down.At least the kills are enjoyable, but the ""suspense"" isn't nerve-wracking or exciting. Focusing on the positives, the acting is just okay and it's a decent mystery. Still, nothing can make up for this disappointing horror film that leaves you uninterested and unexcited for Fear Street: 1978.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The main actors are in a hospital, then a field, then in the streets, then in a bedroom without a coherent junction between the events. One 35 second hospital scene had 13 edits. Just tiresome along with worst parents ever and tired boring non-tension dialogue. Regardless of scene, the main actors appear like they are waiting in line at a mall. Non-existent emotions or tension.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
90,darkreignn,Fun characters make this slasher as entertaining as it is,6,19 October 2021,"""Fear Street"" is an interesting choice of title for a movie that never once specifically mentions a street, let alone one that is to be a source of fear. Sure, there's plenty of forests, shopping malls, hospitals, and high schools - but a street? More like a streak, as in a killing streak, because there seems to be a murderer on the loose who'd like nothing more than to add to his body count.""Fear Street: 1994"" takes place in the town of Shadyside, in the year 1994 (not sure if I needed to specify that or not) - it's a town where prospects are so bleak, where the taking of life is so commonplace, that inhabitants are more likely to make a joke of and mock the victims then make real efforts to protect themselves. Enter Deena, played by Kiana Madeira. Upset about her recent breakup with her girlfriend Sam, Deena spends the majority of her days visibly upset at everything wrong that is going on in her life. And as if things couldn't get any worse, she suddenly finds herself stalked by someone with a knife.Slasher cliches are abundant in ""Fear Street,"" but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Giving the audience what they want can work when there is another hook to draw viewers in - for me, I was hoping that hook would be the 90's setting. Unfortunately, I found the fact that this movie takes place in 1994 to be pretty meaningless, with the 90's backdrop never utilized to its fullest potential. There are, of course, some classic songs played, and one character spends their time on an AOL chatroom; that said, there wasn't much else in the way of 90's nostalgia, which disappointed me. Truth be told, there were a lot of times where I actually forgot that this story was supposed to be occurring in '94.If you can look past this, however, or if this doesn't bother you as much as it did me, you'll find a perfectly serviceable, somewhat entertaining slasher film. There is some nice violence here, with one moment in particular that had me grinning like an idiot because of how unexpectedly gory the kill was. What really kept me engaged, though, was the cast of colorful characters, specifically Deena and Olivia Scott Welch's Sam. Olivia is not only extremely gorgeous but also very expressive in her facial mannerisms. She has a uniquely pretty face, one that was certainly made for acting. Perhaps I'm biased because of how attractive I found her, but I thought she was the show stealer.Kiana Madeira was also a joy to watch. While it would've been easy to have her act as a stereotypical emo teenager, she's surprisingly nuanced and tender in her portrayal of Deena. While bad dialogue does, at times, threaten to damper the performances, I did find all actors in this movie to be very good, with little to no moments of cringe. And in a teen horror film, that's a huge compliment.Honestly, the more I think about this movie the more I like it (the ending especially is fantastic), but the fact of the matter is the story does feel half-baked - and this might be because of the fact that there are still two more movies I need to watch to complete the narrative. While I really enjoyed my time with the characters, I think ""Fear Street: 1994"" would've worked better as a television series; more time to set up the characters and build meaningful relationships would've worked wonders here. However, with what we get, we get a pretty fun little flick - and hey, if you enjoy it, there's two more movies at your disposal.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
91,johnsmithjanuary-20081,Starts cringey but stick with it,9,13 July 2021,Starts out like a low budget basic horror thriller rip off with a poor production quality. If you make it past the first 15 or 20 minutes it should be entertaining enough to finish and it's worth it by the end. Not very elaborate or over the top creative but it's certainly worth watching in regards to the entertainment factor if you like teen slasher/horror movies.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
92,gabriel_sanchez,It got me wanting parts two and three...,6,27 September 2021,"I can't say you would be in for something new in this movie. Do you like slasher movies? So fasten your seatbelt.A group of teenagers are being hunted down by a masked killer. But turns out this is not your regular psycopath.Fear Street: 1994 (2021) is your regular slasher movie with a number of tributes to classics of the slasher genre:Creepy masked guy observing in the distance, check.Fakescares and jumpscares, check.Teenagers, check.Babysitting, check.Possible supernatural explanation, check.Gore, check.The plot (so far) is nothing extraordinary. The kind of plot you would expect from a slasher movie. The ""so far"" hint here, and as you can cleary guess from the movie's title, is that this is only part one. And this movie is split into three parts, apparently.The main problem is that the (most) main character is kinda of a jerk, at least to me. I just don't care about her. Most of the movies, I was either cheering for the other characters or just watching the story unfold without expectations. The likeable characters seem dismissible considering the movie's plot.I definitely got hooked up to watch the other parts, but mainly because I want to see where the rabbit hole ends. I like horror movies, so this is the major reason why I want to keep going. However, I need to admit I fast-forward a tiny bit of this movie to sort of skip some slow-a** unimportant stuff. I think this happened because the main character is not likeable to me and the others are just stereotipycal. Ehen they were trying to develop some characters, I just didn't care. I was just caring about the main plot.So far, this movie is not up in my top 10 horror movies, definitely. Is this movie good to be in my top 10 slasher movies? It depends, but because this movie is split in at least three parts, I think watching all parts can be quite overwhelming for those that are not fan of the horror or slasher genre.I recommend this movie only to those familiar with the genre and up for a long ride.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
93,mr_bickle_the_pickle,4 for 1994,4,28 August 2021,"I didnt get the hype for this movie. There were some elements I liked. Like the supernatural cursed town backstory. But the movie kind of came off like a generic slasher. Down to infuriating characters. Seriously, they were the worst part for me. None of them were very likable. The main girl's friends openly make fun of another student that just died. Like, this is supposed to make us root for you? The characters do a bunch of dumb crap. Even down to being horny in the middle of getting hunted down. And they flip flop. One minute they're all like ""Hoo-rah, lets go team"" and the next its ""Every Man for themselves"" and then they go back to being the best of friends. And then to top it off...the dang soundtrack. Was the director obligated to play a new song every 10 seconds or something? Maybe focus on your story next time instead of constantly having to remind us what year it is by playing every song that from that time period.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
94,dormesher-21565,Fear Street 1994 review..,9,10 July 2021,"Fear Street 1994. A brilliant horror Slasher loosely based on the book series by RL Stine which is the surprise of the Summer and a Fantastic horror that pays homage to 90s Slashers like Scream.The characters where great especially Deena and Sam the two main characters that are in a relationship which serves the story well and they both have some great moments in the film and the performances are great.The story in this is really well handled and tells the story of a town called Shadyside that is cursed by a Witch called Sarah Fier and now a circle of teenage friends accidentally encounter the ancient evil responsible for a series of brutal murders that have plagued their town for over 300 years.The movie has a good mix of Slasher movies and a Supernatural twist that gave the movie its interesting concept.The Kills are awesome especially in the third act of the movie which has a highlight kill with a Bread Slicer which is bloody awesome.The killers are awesome and like how each one is different through the years like the Axe Killer who was in Camp Nightwing in 1978.Also each killer has there own unique style which I like.My favourite killer is Ruby Lane she has an interesting Gimmick of singing when she is going to kill someone which adds to the creep factor.The Cliffhanger ending is also great and really leaves you wanting more and I really need to see the next one.Only issues with the movie is most of the humour doesn't work and could of been done better.I also feel like the characters although I liked them are charactures like you have the nerd, the funny one and the tough girl and they don't do anything new with these type of characters and you've seen these types of characters in most Slashers.Verdict 9/10 a surprise of the Summer and a great Slasher movie that is a love letter to 90s slashers like Scream.The humour doesn't work for me and the characters are nothing new but the Kills and story are awesome and I really enjoyed this first installment of Fear Street.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
95,kenzibit,High School Slasher Flick Part 1.,5,4 July 2021,Lots of nostalgia from this movie. It started out nice and very interesting but from the middle to the end was so childish with nnrealistic runs. Some events folded out very nicely but not so many.

I dunno, almost everything felt modern. I was expecting the set will really look 90's because the title has the year 1994 in it, but nope.The acting is surprisingly well done. I think all the actors did a great job. The story is okay, there are a few nice unpredictable moments. But there are also a lot of ridiculous moments, which is expected in this kind of movie.

Just look at so many bad reviews about really great, classic movies. All the negativity comes from young people, born after 2000. And now old people (like me😅) are coming here leaving reviews about new movies.It is an alright movie, lots of blood and screaming so we have the basics. I loved the cinematography. The colors and music. Simple characters.But don't expect a Sleep away camp's or the first Halloween movie's charms obviously. You know why? Because it's not the 70s-80s-90s anymore! MKay.

In the traces of many other films of the genre, but in its own style. It has a strong immoral element, sexism, drugs and familiarity with death (suicide). But the focus is on the two girls protagonists and their love. And all of this is supposed to non-adult people, teenagers ... Beyond that style of the film, in general, it has no huge differences than other splatter films, again there is the chase with sharp objects, serial killers etc., with only differentiation that murderers are essentially possessed by the old curse of a witch and do not die until they exterminate their next goals. In the positive part, despite the roles given to them, most protagonists were very good in acting in general.

So keep that in mind.Overall I thought this was a fine movie. It has some Scream vibes to it, especially the killer. But as a whole, this movie isn't very serious at all. Making all the sappy moments all the more boring. This isn't a bad thing, but I felt that the runtime didn't really earn it's length.The directing is fun and pretty solid. It's smart here and there and generally it is shot really nicely. Though there was a lack of consistency. It felt like they just tried a lot of things, which make for an interesting experience, but never really immersed you.The music is what really makes this a teenage slasher flick, sometimes even feeling a little too juvenile? Some scenes gave me nickelodeon teenage show vibes. That said that was very limited. Because there is some intense violence and gore in this movie. Some stuff I did not expect.The kills, gore and violence is honestly surprisingly good. The practical and visual effects look very convincing. And honestly, with all the violence that happened, these kids should have severe PTSD and trauma.The script, don't expect anything deeper than teenage drama. The kids hardly even care about the people being killed around them, even people close to them which I found most annoying. Like they don't seem to have any emotion at times all, far too unrealistic for me to get into the movie. But I guess it was never the intention of the director to make this much of a drama or heavy hitting.The ''monsters'' here are okay.

113,theredsky,Fear Street Part 1: 1994,5,12 July 2021,"It's fine. There really isn't a whole lot to say about this film as it is the first part of a trilogy and my opinion could change when the trilogy is over but it's definitely a weak first act. I liked some of the references to films like Scream and The Shining but that's the main selling point to me. I liked watching and seeing what films they were referencing but everything else was kinda bland. The film isn't super long but it feels like it is. It peaks at the beginning with the Scream homage with Maya Hawke but it fails to keep my interest after that. I didn't find the characters all that relatable or engaging however that could change with the other 2 films in this trilogy. The tone is all over the place. It's got some great horror moments and some interesting set up with the creatures being attracted to only one person but the film takes a break from all this action for two steamy scenes. This would be fine if we weren't shown that the monsters were relentless and pretty quick to catch up to their prey. The soundtrack also adds to this tonal inconsistency. The songs are good but their placement is weird and it feels like it's trying too hard to be like Stranger Things. I liked the film's use of violence though and how relentless it is. Some of these scenes are pretty brutal and it's refreshing to see that this film has a massive ""No One Is Safe"" sign on it. Don't get too attached to these characters. The film's use of neon colors was pretty refreshing especially in the beginning. It's a shame they abandoned this style for a majority of the film and only really bringing it back in the end. I would recommend checking this out if you want something that feels like Stranger Things or if you want homages to classic horror films but don't expect something on the same level as those.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The plot tries to account for this by having most of the action take place in the middle of the night, and also by beating us over the head with the notion of Shadyside as a depressed little town. However, the plot forgot to account for the kids going to neighboring Sunnyvale for assistance from the cops, and subsequently having ONLY the Sunnyvale cops investigating the goings on. I get that Deena felt Sheriff Goode's overture to help was worth following up on, but is he seriously the only lawman for two towns? He shows up at the other investigations too. Is Shadyside so depressed they don't even have their own law enforcement to call? So yeah, there are a few plot holes, but stacked against what the movie gets right it's fairly minor. The soundtrack is mostly on point, even though I wished they would have spaced out some of the songs a bit more than they did. They get the phone aspect correct, those chunky landline sets were still popular then, and only upper income people carried around cell phones everywhere they went. Teens really were that unsupervised during that era. The bit with the mall was particularly nostalgic, with the first victim working in a B. Dalton's and another character working in a Spencer's Emporium. This first movie in the series felt like an homage to meta horror which was popular in the 90's. The second chapter looks like it might be an homage to 70's era summer camp slashers. Tying it all together is a trilogy arch concerning a witch who was executed in the 17th century and has apparently been exacting her revenge through proxies in succeeding centuries. I say 'apparently' because whoever was doing that last ritual looked alive to me.There's also the mystery of why Shadyside is so unlucky -- one might even say cursed -- and why Sunnyvale is so comparatively lucky. I assume more on that story is coming in the next two installments, and wanting to find out that whole deal is enough to keep me tuned in. I felt like this first movie was a little padded out and it could have had about twenty minutes shaved off and been a much tighter narrative. I also felt like the production had some missed opportunities with set pieces. The kids stole an ambulance. They could have staged Sam's resurrection without having to go to the grocery store, and it would have improved the pacing and also helped the audience ignore the whole 'why is nobody investigating this ruckus' deal. It also made no sense why the kids painted blood targets on themselves for that. They knew where the revenants were going to go, so all they did was remove their own element of surprise and hand it over to the revenants.But faults and all, this was still a much more worthwhile watch than most straight to streaming stuff I've seen lately.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

There are tons profanities and there are scenes not meant to be seen by a younger audience and I really don't recall reading about it in any of the books.

It delivers the gore and the spookhouse atmosphere well even when the plot and characterizations feel flimsy. It makes a few missteps, but always ends up pulling you back in a few moments later.

He has always nailed the tween/teen horror genre and this might honestly be the best adaptation we've gotten so far. The witty comedy stays true to the old stories as well as the brutality that surely hasn't been shown in any goosebumps series or movie yet. Blending all this together is the director's ode to 90s style slashers in the visuals and atmosphere of this intro film in the trilogy. This really could've been released in 1996 and we wouldn't know the difference. The cast is very well put together and bring these characters from the books to life very well. While sometimes the overall delivery can get cliché it's still maintains a great deal of entertainment value, and I can't wait to see what the next two films have in store in the fear street trilogy.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

It's very well acted which is something I wasn't expecting at all. At first I thought this is a slasher which I am not into but the supernatural element was great. There's ample gore and cheese as there should be. There's 90s young romance and the songs, though not my jam, elevated the experience.There are some shots in final supermarket which were very creative and the lighting choices in some scenes were very clever. For a movie that's supposed to be very B movie-ish the production was surprisingly good.Now it's not 10/10 but gotta fight the low ratings. So it's a 7/10 for me.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

That said, this film is more than a decent adaptation (non-direct) of his work. It certainly delivered on the nostalgia c.80s/90s. Musical score hit many a sweet-spot. Admirable performances all round. Not to repeat myself, but the movie is potently nostalgic. I was born in the late 80s and grew up in the 90s so this movie truly hit all the right notes for me. Production design (edifice and vehicle interiors/exteriors included, as well as various knick-knacks) is sheer brilliance, and award-worthy. Costume design, just as. Locations! The colour palette is classic 90s. The movie vibes of that era practically leaped out of my computer screen. Great work on this film, particularly on a technical level.

For horror fans, there is nothing new here but if you enjoy teen drama or are looking for an early venture into the world of horror this would be pretty good. The only real surprise was the level of gore which was quite graphic at times and caught me off guard compared with the overall tone. There is a lot familiar from 90s films such as Scream, particularly in the pacing and characters but on the whole Fear Street 1994 felt like a stylish Netflix product arrived at through some sophisticated number crunching and audience analysis.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
131,jcslawyer,Wish I had more to add,4,3 July 2021,"Many other reviewers hit the nail on the head. Right off the bat, the soundtrack was shoved in your face. I felt like it was yelling at me through the screen that this was supposed to be 1994...even though the title is, in fact, 1994. On top of that was the use of songs that weren't released in 1994. I spent most of the first 20 mins, as they went from song to song on my personal 90's mix, looking up the songs to confirm they were from later years. Plus, the Sophie B song, although awesome in its own right, was like 2 years before and was just so out of context given that they were trying so hard to pound 1994 in your head. I would've been ok with them sticking to one song at a time for longer than 10 seconds rather than try to do an entire Billboard top 50 of 90's music.The computer thing took me out too. I don't remember the chat boxes being so intricate then. And hell no on the high speed internet. Did anyone notice how, while the kid was chatting online, sister answers the tele? And his ass didn't get kicked offline? No way unless they had 2 dedicated lines. But still, that kid's internet was way too stable.No doubt, this was a poor man's Scream, IKWYDLS, and other fun lil' slashers from the day. But I was genuinely bored because I saw those years ago. The addition of the underlying witch thing just made it so they could tell themselves they weren't ripping off Scream. Even having a somewhat cameo from Maya Hawke gave me Drew vibes as you knew exactly where that was going.The characters were really not likable except the little brother. He was the only one who didn't make me feel like I was watching a modern, boring Freeform show for teens and YA. The main character (his big sister whose name I forgot until this second) was wooden. Perhaps it was her script because she probably has potential. Her girlfriend was a dud...again, probably the script. They tried to make the one guy the comic relief, but it didn't have that effect. It was really desperate and more could've been done with him because he looked like he could play the part. Kate, though flawed, was likable too, and they could've done so much more with her.As for nostalgia, I didn't come close to feeling transported back to high school. Throwing in some rando music and some skater haircuts does not make this magically whisk you away to 1994. They should've looked up how to do nostalgia from Stranger Things. That's a pretty fun show to watch, but simply thinking about it takes me back to my childhood.This was not a short movie. So how come it missed the mark? Dunno to be honest other than what I said before. I think we all, as the audience, deserve more character development to feel some connection rather than typical horror movie sterotypes with not even one dimension. And we've got 2 more to go. Luckily they can have a pass on dealing with nostalgia with 1666 since I'm pretty sure they didn't have Bush or Garbage.... But 1978, nope. You better make it worthwhile or I'm done. So far, from the trailer for the next one, it looks like straight up Friday the 13th Ripoff or Sleepaway Camp. Odd choice of songs for the 1978 preview.... School's Out which came out 6 years earlier. Not trying to say, at all, that people don't listen to older music in any given year...I'm only saying that if you're going to name your movie a particular year, then let's get serious... Yeah, I'm talking to you Sweet Jane from 1988.I'd say give it a watch if you don't have anything else to watch. But don't expect this to be new or groundbreaking or the scariest movie in years.

After seeing all three, I'd say this on does a good job (especially towards the end) of building up excitement for the trilogy. The killers and the obvious love for the genre are Part I's strongest aspects (as well as some truly gnarly gore). I actually really liked the main characters and their dynamics. Deena and her brother had a great relationship...but..The Bad: her relationship with um...pale blonde girl is exceptionally bad. They don't have a ton of chemistry and that this is supposedly the emotional heart of the film...is a problem. Another big one? The Sunnyvale/Shadyside rivalry takes up WAY too much of the film, isn't particularly interesting, and it ultimately doesn't mean anything.The Ugly: The opening scene with Maya Hawke is awesome. I know it's 2021, but I'm not sick of Scream homages yet. Also, I think the anchronisms in this are fine. It's 94, not 49. It gets worse. Trust me.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
138,Amthermandes,Tries too hard to be creative while pandering to the 80's throwback craze,6,1 September 2021,"It's quite obvious the film panders to two different audiences simultaneously: Those that grew up in the 80's/90's and love the classic slashers, and the newer generations that are looking for the newest, most exhilarating thrills. Guiltily, it does a decent enough job of it, but falls short of expectation.It has its fun moments, its humorous moments, its gory moments, but overall the film is merely a decent homage to those classic slashers we grew up with. It's fast-paced in an effort to cajole the younger audiences with the shorter attention spans. It bows to the voracious demands of the modern gay and feminist communities despite its audience already being of an accepting nature. It puts on a facade of being an original modern horror piece, when there's really nothing original or unsurprising about it at all.That being said, it's still a bit entertaining, and hopefully the payoff is delivered in the sequels, and that it's not trending for no reason.

146,A_Llama_Drama,Goosebumps without the thrills,4,27 October 2021,"Fear Street: 1994 is a poorly thought out slasher, aiming at social commentary and missing spectacularly.Blending genre is fine, it worked for Jordan Peele, but moviemakers need to remember, when you make a genre flick, get the focal genre down right before you add in other things. Unfortunately, Fear Street:1994 collapses under itself, with a tryhard soundtrack, clueless inclusion and poorly plotted thrills.The year is 1994, the main characters are a lesbian couple, who are, it appears, out at their school? And no one cares? It's insulting. Some of us lived through the 90s and this revisionism is disgusting to sit through. Tell the truth, especially when you're aiming for a deeper meaning.The soundtrack is fine for a moment, but when ""Insane in the Membrane"" crashes right into ""Creep,"" it's like a flex from Netflix rather than an appropriate use of pop music to set a tone. We get it, you're hella down with the beats.Lastly, it's a horror/teen slasher, but the ""teen"" part never links up with the rest. Joe Dante's ""The Hole"" showed how you could make horror terrifying for a young audience, as did the OG ""The Witches"" or ""Monster Squad."" That a young audience can see villains and experience fear and the horror of living and dying without being subjected to heads being put through cake cutters. Here, the tone is very tween, with dumb decisions made by dumb kids, and optimism in places you wouldn't expect it in a slasher, only to smash the bright lights out with an axe to the head or the repeated stabbing of one's heart. The tonal shifts are a problem. Who is the audience for this? It can't be adults, because in a Post-Scream world, they expect and know better, and it can't be youngsters, because the violence prohibits it.End of the day, if you're gonna set a film in 1994, you need to commit to it, and not just use the era as window dressing for an ambling slasher flick.

I never really read much Fear Street growing up, but I will say one thing: this movie feels a lot like what I remember of R. L. Stine's work on Goosebumps.That's not a bad thing, and Fear Street definitely (DEFINITELY) isn't a movie for kids. This movie is Rated R, and with some very good reasons. It has swearing, drugs, and more than its fair share of violence. Never anything I would describe as over-the-top, but it also does not pull its punches.And yet... if you know R. L. Stine's corny dialog, this movie tries to match that cadence. But that's just Fear Street's vibe, and you gotta learn to roll with it. Though I initially found myself rolling my eyes, it won me over. All of the period-appropriate product placement, the soundtrack stuffed with 90's pop-culture music, it's like somebody took what Stranger Things was trying to do and actually made it charming instead of just vapidly referential.It all makes for a surprisingly even-handed movie. It walks a fine line of being cheesy without being too cheesy, nostalgic without being hollow, and bloody without being super gratuitous. I had a lot of fun and I'm looking forward to the next two.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
159,mrrcave,Throughly enjoyed parts 1 & 2,8,11 July 2021,"Wasn't expecting much from this and at the start it looked like a typical Slasher film with all the cliche's thrown in for good measure: jocks at school, popular girls vs the rebellious girl, but watched parts 1 & 2 back to back and loved it.I found it funny, a touch romantic and at times plain daft, but the characters were believable and the plot thickens (shown from various time angles) to the point where it is removed from all the other horror films I've watched (and I have watched so,so,so many).Can't wait for the 3rd installment, and had it been available last night I would have gladly stayed up until 3 am to see how it all pans out.Definitely worth watching, and I think some of the detractors in their reviews just don't get horror films at all.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

Its pretty funny seeing so much of my childhood rushing back at me.

167,Likeafrisbee,I was very much impressed!,10,2 August 2021,Wow this was a good movie it got it all. It's rare that a horror movie has a good story. There have not been such good movies since Scream 1. But here you see something that is on the same level as Scream.

169,prolelol,Don't expect much if you are a fan of Fear Street books.,7,2 July 2021,"As a huge fan of Fear Street books, this movie isn't a bad and all, but there are few problems:1) It feels more like Netflix supernatural horror movie with little Fear Street reference. There are barely supernatural/witch stuff in the Fear Street books. I'd say it's a similar movie like Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark.2) Uhm... Where is everybody in the film? There are injured teenagers running around yelling and... there are no people in the street. What is this, Pretty Little Liars?3) This movie didn't give me enough nostalgia, especially after you watched Stranger Things. Barely '90s vibes.4) Even if it's R-rated movie, there is not enough gore.5) I strongly believe this movie wasn't based on ANY Fear Street books.6) No R. L. Stine cameo like in Goosebumps movies.Overall, it's good, but not great! Nice cast, cool colors, likeable main character and good opening. That's all!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

It's a woke film series in three different eras. The 1666 film was hilarious for the dialogue alone. 1666 snd they speak colloquial American English. Who would have thunk it?

171,korythacher,"Very average, I hope the other parts are better",5,8 October 2021,"This movie had a lot of hype from Netflix, but it's just a pretty average supernatural slasher.Great production quality, uninspired story, and a decent amount of logic gaps. There is tons of gore and the effects are good. Honestly I enjoyed all the 90s music to continually remind us that it is the 90s and if they'd had a better story then it would probably push a 6-7.One thing that really killed the immersion is that they have an unbelievable ""small town rivalry"" because all the kids seem to be a little too extreme, psychotic, and violent right from the start. If they dialed that down a bit, then it would have felt much smoother.I was under the impression that each of the 3 parts were stand alone, but the ending implies that they are not. I'll watch the others for sure, and I'm hoping they're a little bit better because the production quality *is* there, but I'm not excited about them anymore.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
172,brentn,Reviewing the whole trilogy.,7,18 August 2021,"First off, each movie released 2 weeks apart was a very cool marketing ploy. Secondly, Netflix has done it again, this time with a decent adaptation from the more graphic side of R. L Stine. I found each movie intriguing in it's own right. Most of the actors are unknowns aside from a couple familiars from Stranger Things but the story is quite strong and compelling. The characters were relatively likeable, headstrong and determined. The action and thrills were not few and far between but perfectly placed for good balance and they are most definitely graphic and gory. Some of the acting is a little forced and unconvincing but as mentioned the cast are mostly unknowns so it's forgiveble. The trilogy was well paced and doesn't dwell on things for too long. I also found the music to be good nostalgia for the time periods. All in all I say watch and enjoy. Solid new age trilogy.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
173,tiffanytallent1981,Not too bad!!,5,16 July 2021,"This movie is like Scream, The Babysitter Killer Queen, Stranger Things, Riverdale, and Empire Records, rolled into one. The beginning scenes are awesome and really draw you in. Slashers are my favorite type of horror and the death scenes definitely lived up to what I expected. There are definite 90's vibes throughout, although some things they got wrong. Everyone not having cell phones was good enough for me. When more murders start taking place around a group of friends, they go to the sheriff. But of course, he doesn't seemed too concerned. So the group has to take matters into their own hands. There are the typical boring moments and ""stop to make out"" moments. It also felt like something was missing. Maybe it was the main lead girl, as she wasn't very personable. The movie was still entertaining enough to watch once and had a decent little twist. I doubt I'll watch the first part again, but I'm still looking forward to the next one.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

176,ksdouglas-23618,"Why is this set in the '90s, again?",3,30 July 2021,"Seriously? I watched this whole film and saved judgment on the matter that maybe something relevant from this era would come into play in the story. But besides the music, which honestly doesn't count since you hear these songs today on the radio, nothing in the film gives reason for this movie to be set in random 1994. The period piece angle is non-existent. I felt the same way with WW84, just randomly set in 1984 but felt no different than today. This movie could just as easily be set today and absolutely nothing would have been changed with the plot. I lost interest about halfway through. This whole movie was basically live-action Scooby-Doo with a lot more swearing. The characters were stupidly annoying but I guess that was the point since this movie is more of a weird homage/parody of the 1980s, '90s, and early '00s slasher films. Other than that, I feel this movie would have made a lot more sense if it came out about 20 years earlier. I mean, really, 'Freddy Vs. Jason' is a masterpiece compared to this lame film.

178,EpimetheusA1,Doesn't feel like Fear Street,5,2 July 2021,"This is okay. It doesn't feel like Fear Street to me- Fear Street was less about the gruesome methods of murder and more about the sinister side of mankind and it's twist endings. This is a Stranger Things template with Fear Street just filling in the details. Nosebleeds and all. This film is all about the nineties feel but that wasn't what us fans loved about the series. I think people who haven't read the series would enjoy this more than those who have. Its for fans of Stranger Things who like bloody things... and compared to Stranger Things, it's just okay. It's cringe at times, unfortunately. Better luck next time. Worthy effort.The books didn't have a lot of sex, cursing, drugs- they had plot. Adding those things doesn't make the content more mature. It just didn't have what the books had- the twist endings and twisted characters and the different plights- it felt like it was trying to be Stranger Things, Euphoria, Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark, and it was failing at all of them.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

When I saw this had come out on Netflix I was excited but I didn't have time to watch it straight away, but I took a quick look at the reviews on here. In truth, what I read really put me off from watching it.Except until tonight, I needed a distraction from grief, nothing was working, so I thought I'd give Part 1 a shot. I'm so glad I did! I was distracted and entertained all the way through. Not disappointed in anyway. As for whether or not the film paid homage to the 90s itself, I really think it did (except for 1 spoken line) - the music soundtrack was fantastic and brought back so many nostalgic feels, the technology/gaming/AOL was just as it was in the era, and I even think the wardrobe fit into the time too. Also regarding the plot alone, I disagree with people saying it didn't make sense, in my opinion it added up and was easy to go with, as well as following R L Stine's style. The instrumental score was also brilliant, whoever composed it did the film justice. All in all I loved watching this, it definitely paid respects to the Fear Street Franchise in my opinion, and I can't wait to watch Part 2 and 3!

188,AxProductions,Entertaining but not great,5,3 July 2021,"This is by all means a great watch, but it's defiantly not a great film, and goes into the realm of cringe and funny at points, due to the horrible script, and off beat pacing of the film.Just know, if your looking for something to pass the time, this is great, but not for anything deeper.The relationships developed throughout the film seem incredibly forced, and like they where meant to be ticked off of a production sheet, rather than being implemented into the film for an actual story ark.The entire film is also incredibly empty, and there are a lot of plot holes that just don't make any sense, such as how the characters walked into a store at 1 am or something, without breaking in?The pacing is also off, with the first hour and a half of the film being really slow, but not in pace, but rather substance, it just feels like this could have been 1 episode out of a series rather than a whole film.The world of the film is also not really established, it feels like they are trying to create a realistic world at the start, with some genuinely great set design in the school, and realistic script and acting, but then the show just breaks apart during the hospital scene, where 7 people die and nobody notices in an open hospital ? Do only 7 people work at a hospital, this just doesn't make sense to meThe cinematography is pretty decent, but nothing insane, there are definitely some great singular shots, but for the most part, very similar to other shows and movies creating a decent feel that is very average.The script, oh the script is straight up shocking. With lines like ""are you sure you want to do this"" led up by ""see you on the other side"". No one talks like this, and this was all said after she had already leaked her blood for the cause, it makes no sense the script, blatant and bad.The editing is actually pretty good, with some montage segments that hit pretty well, however, in general, you won't see any marvels of editing in this film, with some of the cuts at the start seeming a little sloppyOverall it's decent, but I will almost definitely forget about it in a months timeCinematography - 6.8/10

Too much teen drama.

Not only does it end on a cliff hanger, the whole intro and first act are shoving down your throat the contrast between Shadyside and Sunnyvale. Can't even type the names without chuckling, but my point is that plot thread goes nowhere and it's forgotten, presumably because this is first of 3(?) movies. You will have to watch at least two films for any kind of resolution.Other than that, the film looks good, there are like 7 ""jump scares"" in the first 5 minutes alone, the main character is introduced with a song which goes ""I'm only happy when it rains, I'm only happy when it's complicated"" and also is the worst of the bunch.

194,pjr235,I there such a thing as off-beat Horror?,6,23 July 2021,"I had such a hard time pinning this movie down. For the life of me, what ever tune they were playing, I couldn't find the rhythm to dance to it. Maybe its the fact that they were so young - like it harkened back to the old slasher flicks but the actors were almost always adults.. dealing with sex drugs and rock n roll. This is like a coming of age love friendship and murder fest but on The CW.I've seen other reviews talking about the opening, it was decent and set the tone but idk I just couldn't ""lock-in"" for this movie. And I'm a full spectrum kind of person, the other day after realizing Im out of Zombie movies to watch, I saw Warm Bodies, 30 mins in and I just agreed to let the movie take this new direction, be all cutesy Twilight-y, I knew what it was, it knew what it was. And I kinda liked it.Maybe that's it? An identity problem? Maybe Fear Street tried to throw so many nods it couldn't keep its own head straight. I read articles saying the characters being different was intentional or some other nonsense and I was like 'uhh they were pretty standard, focus on something else.' I had such a hard time locking on I felt compelled to write a review and take this time.Spoilers ahead:Then there were the inconsistencies. Like the father who works day and night but finds the time to be a drunk and leave beer cans everywhere but also never be seen once in the movie. They weren't in a cabin in the woods, where is everyone's parents? They all had these character details that never panned out. The drug dealing friend who we've only ever seen with the pills but never dealing, no challenges to face from it = leave it out. The main character was going through a break up but it turns out she was just sabotaging herself for the dumbest of reasons, felt like crocodile tears. Would have been way more powerful if even a bit cliche if the ex-gf was in denial and the ex broke it off.It didnt move the genre forward, it didnt do anything new really and it added some twists where they werent needed. Hence the 'off-beat' part of the title on this review.I could go on but lets just skip to the verdict. IMO you are not missing much at all if you choose to skip. I imagine this would bomb if it was released in theaters and was only greenlit bc of the apparently well-known books and lack of horror content these days. It just wont be making into my rotation of classics. Warm Bodies wont either but I still liked. This was one notch above passable for the 2 or 3 satisfying kills, but not enough to keep it around. Freaky 2020 was more fun. I'd say go for that.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
195,JoelAlexanderr,"A good slasher flick, but not much else",5,12 July 2021,"FEAR STREET: PART ONE - 1994 is great for what it is -- a nostalgic teen slasher horror movie with some brutal and gory deaths to satisfy fans of the genre. However, anyone looking for something else besides camp and nostalgia will likely be disappointed.The movie feels like a cross between recent nostalgia-filled adventures like It or Stranger Things and slasher movies like Scream and Halloween. This formula makes for some fun scenes of horror, especially the opening scene with Maya Hawke, a scene that calls back to the opener with Drew Barrymore in Scream. Unfortunately, once the principal characters are introduced I found the movie to get far weaker, mainly because the protagonists were difficult to latch onto. The writers try to create sympathy by having the main overarching theme be the teens' struggle to get out of Shadyside, the haunted town that they reside in, but this motivation never hits home due to some poor character writing. Almost every protagonist whom the audience is supposed to cheer for makes such horrible decisions and puts blame on other people so often that by the end I could have cared less what happened to many of them. Sure, the gruesome deaths were still fun, but if I just wanted blood then I could just look up clips from various movies on YouTube.In the end, I enjoy horror far more when I am truly invested in the story and characters, and in FEAR STREET: PART ONE - 1994 that never quite happened. Many people will enjoy this film for the campy fun it offers, but it was never so outrageously entertaining or thrilling that I'll remember it in more than a month. C.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
196,Camerenth,Disappointing,4,18 July 2021,The appeal of a Goosebumps style horror movie with extreme violence is all it has going for it. It is violent and the tone of the movie makes it unexpected when it does come. But besides that the plot is so generic that you could guess what the characters are gonna say and do before it happens. The characters are also dumb. Almost all of them care more about their relationship drama than the fact that they are about to be killed. Very disappointing and i have no interest in watching the sequels.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
197,Idle_Hands08,Mid-90's Slasher Flick Nostalgia,6,2 July 2021,"If you thought you were going to enjoy this film (part I)... Like me, you'd be right...!Scream, Urban Legend and the like, all play their roles in this film... and you gotta love that. You must know that it's hard to live up to these types of films that shaped the genre, especially in the 89s and 90s... Just enjoy it for what it is...The set design and colour grading will remind you of Stranger Things, no problem there, and the writing is taken from a Goosebumps story, adapted to suit the intended outcome. Even though it's only part I, I'm really looking forward to it being ready as a full trilogy from the outset. It's rated R due to the gore, but definitely has a more PG-13 type of feel to it, and not as intense as the 90's features previously mentioned. The reason being, it's just not really funny enough or scary enough... It needed to be both or focus on one or the other, that's why we will find it's rating no higher than 6/10...The actors are well cast and you will recognise some of them from other teen-comedy-dramas on Netflix. It's good to see them in these roles paying homage to the slasher flick's of yesteryear... The Shadyside and Sunnyville town names were great, and reminded me of the Shellbyville / Springfield rivalry from the Simpson's. The 90's music, products, and early internet usage were fun to watch. The story moves at a good pace and will keep you entertained, of course the main and ultimate goal...!Watch and enjoy...",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
198,willcrabbe,Stale Scream wannabe,4,9 July 2021,"There's not a lot going for Fear Street Part One really, It's not scary, (even the made-for-kids TV series of Goosebumps has more scare value), it's overwhelmingly bland, and the poor pacing leaves it bordering on tedium at times.The production value is good. It shares some similarities with the Netflix series Stranger Things in how stylishly it is composed and presented, but it lacks that special something the Duffer brothers series had. Ultimately that serves to exacerbate the empty feeling the film had. Everything looks fine, but it just feels completely unimaginative and uninspired, mirroring the proceedings of the script.Also, if you thought Cruella had an obnoxiously overbearing soundtrack, just wait until you watch this. Opening with NIN's 'Closer' (the second time I've heard that song in a horror film this year), the film proceeds to barrage you with a whole range of era-relevant music to let you know the film is set in 1994 just in case the title didn't give it away. Funny thing is, some of the songs they used were released after the time in which the film is set. Thankfully they cool down with this onslaught for the second half of the film. I honestly wouldn't have even noticed the film was set in the 90s without the musical cues and obvious references to dated technology as the characters just don't feel like kids plucked from that era. Look to a fellow horror film like It for something that pulls this period-matching off in a far superior fashion. The characters in Fear Street feel like 2021 kids existing in the 90s.Some people have been claiming this as the next Scream and after my viewing of this I can only assume they haven't watched either film. There is certianly a nod or two here and there, but homages and references alone does not a horror classic make. In fact, mostly what it does is remind us of better films we could be watching instead. A far stronger slasher has recently been released in Christopher Landon's Freaky, which takes classic genre tropes and adds a fun and fresh new twist. If you had to pick one to watch, choose that one instead.I guess this film is an okay way to kill 100 minutes and it could serve as a starter point for a younger audience getting into horror, but I doubt I'll ever be revisiting this or even thinking about it next week. The lore and worldbuilding was one of the stronger aspects of the film, so it should be interesting to see what they do with the next two films and how they tie it all together. Hopefully they'll be better than this though.""The most frightening thing about Fear Street: 1994 is just how tedious most of the film is."" - Erik Kain, Forbes.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
199,verbal_666,Rubbish!,1,18 July 2021,"STOP IT!!! It's time to stop producing horror for stupid children, without any content, and with the sole intention of creating sensationalism with a little ""BOOOO!"", few splashes of blood here and there, the usual 80's clichés (enough! !! Of Nightmare there is only ONE !!!) and the usual hackneyed witch who takes possession of some suckling brat. How boring!!! How much idiocy !!! In recent years, independent cinema over all has, for the most part, produced films and horror series of the highest quality, throw this garbage in the toilet or leave it to the Playstation & c. Goons. Don't waste time with this rubbish, and i'm talking about all three chapters, ridiculous !!!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
200,sorendanni,Just a facade?,4,7 July 2021,"Fear Street was a very popular series in the 1990s and 2000s. RL Stine wrote teen thrillers all set somewhere on Fear Street. Although the literary value of these books was limited, they were very exciting stories.I had high hopes for the first of 3 films about Fear Street. Unfortunately I am disappointed. I'll go into the story, the actors and the general experience in a moment. But first the story: that's my biggest problem. There is no mention of 'Fear Street' in the film. Here's a story not about a street, but about an entire village: Shadyside. So is this really based on Fear Street books, or is this just a facade?The makers have copied a lot from Riverdale and even more from Stranger Things. I recognize the strong focus on underlying teenage sexuality from Riverdale. But unfortunately it does nothing for the story, it contains a lot of clichés and everything is unbelievable. What also doesn't do much for the story is how the film showcases the 1990s. I agree music was important in the 90s. But good music should also be used well in your film. Stranger Things does this very well, Fear Street does it very badly. Popular music can enhance images, but the audience must be able to make the link between the music to how the character feels. Fear Street gets this wrong. Instead we get a quick shuffle of all the hits from (and after!) 1994.Also very unfortunate is the lack of authenticity in the outfits. Where Stranger Things went very far to dress characters to how they would have looked in 1984, Fear Street falls straight into the picture. Anyone who went through 1994, even if he was very young, knows that the outfits are wrong. The characters are dressed in the 'retro' outfits that you can buy today at H&M, New Look and ASOS. Everything about their clothing is wrong: wrong brands, wrong combinations, ignoring the subcultures that defined what young people wore.As a Horror film, Fear Street is a big flop! It strikes me that good reviews about this movie come from websites that don't specialize in Thriller and Horror. This film does well with Mainstream Gen Z, with people who otherwise wouldn't watch Horror. With Fear Street there is no build-up of tension, as a viewer you never look into the fear that the character feels. Very horrific things happen to the characters, but it is all very quickly forgotten. They joke, they argue about stupid things, you almost expect everyone to be dancing at a prom the next day. In short, this film is a family adventure film with some very gruesome scenes mixed in. And the acting does not help: Halfway, I came to the conclusion that the acting not only is bad, but the actor's roles are very poorly written as well. Subsequen scenes of fear, joy, anger and depressio don't ad up.4 instead of 5 stars, as they crashed an 80s BMW E30 in perfect condition for this, form over content!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

204,adotson-98233,A great start to this horror trilogy.,8,5 July 2021,"""Fear Street Part One: 1994"", is a very fun and energetic slasher that sets up an intriguing mystery. This movie honestly surprised me and I thought it was a very gory fun film for the summer. The good things in the movie is that the movie is pretty gory. There is definitely blood and some really cool kills. The characters also were very well portrayed. I really liked the main characters dynamic with her girlfriend because I think it helped present something a little different in horror movies. The soundtrack is also very good. It reminds me of ""Scream"" which is never a bad thing.But this isn't a perfect movie I do have a few little issues with it. While the characters were well portrayed, they weren't the most interesting. Some of them didn't really have any characterization. Also there are some things in the film that don't make a whole lot of sense. But it's just little nit picks. And finally, the movie didn't fully capture 1994. I got some sense of the era, but not enough.Overall ""Fear Street Part One: 1994"" is a great start to this trilogy.

Simon was a great character, and he should be the one to move through the next movies, hopefully he does return. This actor was also great in Woman in the Window, and I'm looking forward to more from him.The hair and wardrobe people should never work again. There are a LOT of talented people in Hollywood, and you need to move aside and let real artists do their work. Have you even ever heard of the 90's? Are you all ""90's babies"" who were actually 9 years old in 1994 and think you ""know"" the 90's?

The clothes aren't baggy enough, and the teenagers personalities come from todays world, not 1994.There's interesting background characters, like the security guard and cop, but I'm not sure why they are there.

Almost every single one of them, say for the brother character, reaches new heights of annoyance. In a slasher, you need a few of those unlikable teenagers that you wanna see get killed. The last character you want being presented in such a way is your protagonist. The protagonist here is so incredibly annoying, I wanted to see her die more than the drug dealer girl that made children sort and pack her pills. I realize that this is a book adaptation, but you're allowed to take liberties in order to present a competent feature. However, Netflix opted to throw this one together with very little effort and tease 2 prequels that seem a lot more interesting.

From there, things only get tenser.The movie is able to get straight to the point establishing the conflict of both our main characters and the cities in which the story takes place. All the characters are incredibly fleshed out for a film of this nature. Rather than create cookie-cutter bodies designed only for slaughter, Fear Street creates characters that feel three-dimensional and building their suspense around your connection to these characters.The supernatural element did feel a little out of place at first, but you fall into it quite quickly as it introduces a world of fun killers each intriguing in their own right.

Part: One""Fear Street 1994"" is an American teen slasher flick which is released a week ago on Netflix. This movie is the first part of the triology. It is based on R L Stine's teen horror fiction ""Fear Street"" series.The plot revolves around a town named Shadyside which is famous for serial brutal killing and a group of teenagers try to stop it.First of all, the opening credits are great. The storyline is really good. The focus shifted more on Deena and Sam's relationship than the actual plot. The 90's vibe was somehow missing. All they used are 90's pop songs. Acting is not good. But if you ignore these parts, this movie is entertaining. But there were many opportunities to make the movie more thrilling.According to me, ""Fear Street 1994"" is a one time watch.

I was a kid/teen in the 90s and they got some stuff right, but just a little. Overall it doesn't really matter they used songs from 1996 so much. Though, there was plenty of music they could have used that was actually out at the time, but every period movie does that. Overall, the movie is a good marrying of 80s teen slasher meets mid 90s teen slasher. I do wish they got some of the stuff right. It feels more like 2021, minus cell phones and the clown face make-up of today. Things were a little more o naturale in those days, kinda miss that tbh. I will say I was a tad annoyed by how short the song clips were. None of them were used long enough to set the mood. It felt kinda like a kid with ADHD at the controls of a stereo listening to his dad's playlist. Other than the not so 90s stuff, I really loved how they lit the movie, very moody and colourful. If you were a 90s kid, you read RL Stine. It was kinda expected of you to be into it and everyone was. We all traded books with each other in class. The teachers never caught on to how adult some of the books really were. The whole nastalgia trip was fun and the movie was entertaining enough to not care about what they got wrong.

That said all the 90s references and horror movie tropes, are going to be lost on the teens, who watch this as their first slasher.If you want to watch a mild slasher movie, it's perfectly fine, but be warned it's about as scary as a glow in the dark Skelton.FYI: I can't remember the last time, I was this bored watching a horror movie!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

How does that make any sense?I wish they casted Maya Hawke as the main character and Kiana Madeira
as the girl who dies at the start because I feel like Maya is a more expierenced actor.Also how does a proffesional soundtrack person mess up so bad? The songs are good but alot of them arent from 1994, how do you overlook something like that?I might continue watching and try the other movies because im a big fan of sadie sink.

I have much more respect for a movie like this, that borrows from other movies and has a sense of humor about itself, as opposed to pretentious films like ""Hereditary"" or ""The Conjuring"" mess which steal from others and take themselves way too seriously in the process.Complaints about the lack of 90s retro-style is strangely contradictory to the complaints about the amount of music. The comments seem to come from a younger generation who have a warped sense of the 90s style or can't handle listening to their songs in a nostalgic movie because it makes them feel old.Anyone who lived through the 90s knows that the decade was never as extravagantly stylized as the rest of the 20th century. The street fashions weren't extraordinary and haven't changed much since...
There were details that stood out for me. ""GAP"" style clothing, chunky black clog shoes, baggy sweaters... etc.I went to high school in the 90s. I had very diverse and inclusive friends and we watched horror movies, spoke in chat rooms and listened to music... a lot.Overall, I enjoyed the movie. It was fun.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

I didn't have any expectations because I don't remember much about the Fear Street books but I was pleasantly surprised. There were some predictable moments but for the most part, it was a unique film that did have me on the edge of my seat for quite a bit of it.The opening sequence was definitely intense but it started to lose me about 20 minutes in. The fighting between Shadyside and Sunnyvale and Sam and Deena felt out of place. I feel like there could have been a better way to get to the car crash which led to finding Sarah Fier. The whole sequence of the bus continuing driving while the emergency exit door is open and blaring the alarm is highly unlikely.However, once you get past that and about 20 more minutes of teen angst and drama (which really wasn't needed), the movie got back to the horror elements and finished strong.

Because it sure didn't LOOK like the 90s, except for an AOL chat room and the 4,000 posters on the main character's bedroom walls.Speaking of the main character... she should be LIKEABLE if she's fighting evil. Nobody wants to cheer for a jerk. Her brother is basically the only likeable character in the whole movie.And speaking of characters... did they run out of budget before they could hire extras?

Stine (mostly known for Goosebumps) and it does have some of the cheesy charms and lightness of those novels, but it's an odd mix of silliness with the occasional mean spirited moment that sticks out like a sore thumb.In the film, a teenage lesbian unknowingly awaken an ancient evil after a prank goes wrong and she has to try and keep her and her friends alive long enough to figure out what's going on.Fear Street: 1994 is never really scary, but it does move at a brisk enough pace to keep the audience from asking too many questions as the story rolls along.

The girls are mopey and depressed. The guys ineffectual and nerdy. The lesser characters are obnoxious, like the bored / sassy receptionist at the hospital (one of only two employees there it seems).As for the story, why the ""twin cities"", good vs evil set up? It's just beyond plausible. If you are going to have an over-the-top horror/slasher/occult plot, at least provide a realistic background. A smallish, Midwestern ""normal"" town with one high school would have worked just fine and made the film scarier.And why go into such detailed exposition mid-way through the movie to explain what's going to happen, the mystery behind the killings? Or drop so many hints in the first half? Talk about spoilers.Was expecting so much. But I should have known. Much of the pre-release publicity focused on the 1990s play list.

264,kstice-25195,Good idea weakened by melodrama and bad jokes,6,9 July 2021,"Fear Street is more like a version of Degrassi where people are occasionally murdered than an homage to 90s slashers. While some scenes are scary or horrific, the movie dedicates most of its screen time to melodramatic conversations. These conversations also happen between characters who are extremely one-sided. The dialogue hits particularly low points at certain points. These include a scene where a police officer tells an LGBT couple to run home to their boyfriends and another scene where a character makes a masturbation joke right after the group is attacked by supernatural killers. Even though some deaths are gruesome, the killers themselves range the gamut of dorky to generic. One exceptionally dorky killer is the guy wearing a $5 Party City costume.Despite these drawbacks, there is still enough positives in the movie to give it a 5/10. For one, the idea of an era-spanning horror trilogy is intriguing. I will most likely watch parts two and three even though there were many faults in this movie. Although there are melodramatic conversations, the movie ultimately moves at a quick pace. The horror often takes a backstage to teenage drama, but there are still some particularly good scenes. These scenes include some interesting and shocking kills towards the end of the move. Finally, while the movie often plays songs in too quick of a succession, the soundtrack to the movie was well-chosen.On the whole, Fear Street Part One: 1994 is good enough for one viewing, but does not warrant repeat viewings.Pros and Cons Summary:+Fast paced movie+Some interesting and surprising kills+Good soundtrack-Melodramatic-Poorly written characters-Terrible jokes and dialogue.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
265,skitofit,Not focused on the horror,5,11 July 2021,"This movie was good in some parts. But cliche and stereotypical in others. Right off the bat you get stranger things vibes from the late 80's early 90's, both from the technology available at the time, but more specifically the neon colours in the film. Particularly in the opening the movie centres on a main protagonist only to lose steam and find itself centered on her love life, then the antagonist becomes the new protagonist, and at that point it was lost on me.Unlike stranger things that evenly spread character development across all the characters in the series. We are only privy to 2 characters backstory, and largely both of them are intertwined. So it's basically a cheap lazy trick for the writers.So all in all I give this movie a 5/10, the actors were good and the cinematography was good, and so was the soundtrack. Maybe part 2 will have more character depth and more focus on the more interesting horror aspects of the story then this one did.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

270,thecanadian-23317,"There's a lot to like, but it also has a lot of issues",6,17 July 2021,"This will be as spoiler free as possible, but I'll make some references to occurrences to make my various points.Like many, I wasn't quite sure what to expect with this movie but I decided to give it a whirl. I liked the high level idea of the movie, and some of the characters were interesting (I liked the main character Deena). Her little brother was fun too.But this movie suffers from two main issues and two minor ones for me. Main issue #1: the 90s ""vibe"". This feels like they saw Stranger Things but cranked the idea up to an 11 with 90s references. There are some scenes where it works, but for others there are quite literally two or three different songs in the same scene. It felt REALLY excessive.Main issue #2: the high school drama. It's a movie with high school kids so there's bound to be drama - but the drama feels about as stereotypical as it can get. These characters broke up, this character loves that character, etc.. There's a specific scene where a bunch of pairs of characters ""get down"" all at the same time and it was so eye-roll worthy.Minor issue #1: the logic. I realize that this is a fantastical slasher, so logic isn't going to be the main point. But this movie definitely does not follow logic at all. There's a scene where the main characters run into a police station to tell them about some murders, and the cops react with a ""oh yeah sure, whatever you say you silly kids!"" type of reaction. This is infuriating every time it happens in any movie, and there's some logic issues like that throughout the movie.Minor issue #2: this is an extension of the logic issue, but it technically involves a spoiler. So in keeping it as vague as possible, the main vehicle that the characters use to get around in is the issue. Let's just say that it's stolen, and there's no way that they wouldn't get caught with it. But they use it throughout the entire movie and it makes it very hard to take seriously.If this movie was standalone, I would not recommend it. But this is one of very few circumstances where being first in the trilogy actually works to its benefit, because the central premise did grab me. It feels very ""Stephen King"", in the sense that there's a haunted town with a backstory that the sequels explore. The central idea did grab me, and I'm very interested to see the sequels (especially because I hear that they're better). All of the reviews that label this as a 1-2 star movie are kidding themselves - it's not that bad. But it definitely has some issues.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

274,district-23105,An excellent slasher,7,2 July 2021,"OK. So there's a lot to like here, but on reflection, I've lowered my score to a 7, and here's why.This is a refreshing rework of a very tired genre. I genuinely did not expect the deaths, as it all had a Stranger Things vibe going on. It's a surprisingly gory movie, which was a refreshing change from the sanitised stuff currently doing the rounds.BUT, there were a LOT of cliches, and predictable stuff which could have been reworked to something fresh and more interesting, and some of the things the characters do is frankly ridiculous, but that's why we love these movies.So, the reason for my lowered score is that the movie pays no attention to the mythology it deliberately and very specifically creates. The gang specifically say Skullface and others are only going to kill those they think are Sam (due to having Sam's blood on them), yet the killers murder several people for no clear reason. Hundreds of people make these movies; did no one stop and say HEY we're breaking our own rules here!There was a lot of bloat in Fear Street, but the final act was great and genuinely quite thrilling. I think the three linked movies is an excellent way to refresh a tired genre, but the endless tropes, the overbearing music, and the breaking of the movie's own rules - all stands against it.Still, the fact the movies are going back in time is really interesting, and I can't wait to see what happens next (or happened next).",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

Of the three movies, this is probably the strongest although it's a close tie with part 2 (1978).This reminded me a lot of a film from a couple of years ago - Tales to tell in the dark which again, wasn't too bad and pretty enjoyable.One thing which I felt was a bit... off... was the creepy stalker vibe which the lead actress has. She's crushing on a girl she used to have a relationship with who has started to see a guy.

This review looks at many aspects.First, diversity. The diversity is awesome! Racially, gender identity wise, sexuality wise, socioeconomic, religion, you name it. From what I can tell (and have heard from others), the diversity is also well represented.Second, plot. I love this movie. I'm writing this after having seen all of them, and I can tell you it's worth it. There are so many twists and turns. A lot of people have issues with the high school aspect, but that's just the way things are. It's a movie about high schoolers so you have to deal with the drama. Once you get past that (if it's a thing that bothers you), it's really quite a fascinating movie/story.Finally, so much to unpack. There are metaphors all over. It's also a reflection of modern society, which is to be imagined. If you like to think and analyse, this is the movie for you.Something to note: These films, but this one in particular, are INCREDIBLY violent and graphic and gory. I don't like that, but from the parts that I made myself watch, it looks well done.Another thing to note: The main cast is young. They might not be up to your standard if perfect actors, but they're believable in their roles because they know what it's like. In my opinion, however, the acting is incredible.In conclusion, I really, really liked this movie. I think that the idea of releasing it like this (and honestly the whole thing) is pretty cool.

284,spidermonkeycoleman,Needs a lot of work,5,10 July 2021,"I just spent 15 minutes typing up a review and then IMDB glitched and deleted it so I'm just gonna give a brief review instead and get straight to the point.The acting and writing is the worst part of the movie. It was so bad at times that I had a hard time caring about the movie and focusing on it because I was distracted by the bad acting.The characters were pretty bad. I didn't care for any of them and felt nothing when some of them died. Actually, I cringed in pain at a death near the end so I guess that counts.Weird editing choices that ruin certain scenes that are important to the movie. Also the main character isn't very likeable and her reasoning for being mad at her ex makes no sense at all which only makes you dislike her more.With all the bad, I will say the story was good. I was interested in it and intrigued which was the main thing that kept me watching. The ending was great as well and I am interested in watching Part 2 when it comes out.What hurts the movie the most is that it spends so much time trying to set up the trilogy that it doesn't spend enough time on it's own story in the first movie. In order to get people to watch the rest of these movies you need a strong first film and they really don't succeed at that.Overall, not a terrible movie but a bad one that is a struggle to watch at times. Had I not been intrigued by the ending, I wouldnt care to watch the rest of these movies and honestly I'm only watching the rest to see how the story ends.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
285,avocadosrbad,Was not 90s it was 2021 disguised,3,22 July 2021,"Like all these little douchy kids now, that act like the are 90s they look like knockoffs, we didn't wear mom jeans jerked up the biz. Playing 90s music every couple of minutes doesn't make it 1994. By the way they played music from 95' on, wth? The lesbian thing everyone is freaking out about wasn't as out back then but it wasn't abnormal. It wasn't a big deal and I grew up in a small town. But they don't act like 90s kids they act like little gen z turds. The plot could have been good but as stated a ton of holes and just dumb stuff. Like all the adults are oblivious to the carnage? Like the bus thing? Really? The bus driver is listening to a bunch of kids plan to ""kill"" the other team and the rival team throwing bottles at a school bus?? Really? Dumb. The characters weren't really likable so you really don't care if they die. It was meh. Oh the PILL thing, no one took pills like that back then, we smoked, tripped, maybe the really cool kids could score Coke, but no pills were not over prescribed and passed around back then.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
286,RM-Montoya,Fear street 1994: Wow!,8,24 July 2021,"Now, if your like me. You only knew R. L stein for his goosebumps series. I had no idea he had a whole other book series that was more....bloodyThe movie begins with a teen getting killed In a mall and by then I'm already confused. But in a good way""Why did he do it.""
""Why WOULD he do it""
""Well he's dead now I guess that's it""But then the story starts unraveling slowly and as you watch it...you start getting almost everything.I'm only giving it 8 because the characters of Kate and Simon deserved better.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
287,anthony_ian,What a Disappointment,3,14 July 2021,"I checked it out since it's been trending on Netflix and haven't seen a good slasher movie in forever. The first 10 minutes or so start out well, with a very ""Scream""-like situation--in fact, TOO ""Scream""-like be the killer's getup is almost identical to the killers in ""Scream"".The murder is scary--although the killer is easily guessable from just minutes ago and from there it.... goes over a cliff.Now we're introduced to our characters: loud, shrill, completely overcooked alleged high school kids in the 90s (which we're made to understand because a 90s song plays every 10 seconds) who seem to have exactly zero redeeming features.Every line is delivered with 100% sass and sarcasm and one of the male characters you're literally begging for him to get killed so you don't have to listen to him anymore.The storyline has promise--an evil that recycles itself through the town every few years resulting in carnage, but... *it doesn't matter*. You won't care. The overacting will make you stop caring. It's as if all of these actors watched the entire ""Scream"" series and thought all those roles were underplayed.So yeah there's a lot of ""Scream"" ripoff here as well as some ""Halloween"" and name any other infamous 80s/90s slasher flick. Also even some ""Stranger Things"", albeit older kids, in that apparently only the kids can figure out what's really going on while the adults--including the cops--are clueless dolts.Not worth it. Didn't even finish it. Watch ""It Follows"" if you want a teen scary movie done right.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
288,serina25801,Not What I Expected,7,5 July 2021,"I honestly didn't know what I expected going in. I've read most of the Fear Street books, so I was definitely expecting something violent. The entire film is just like a 80s/90s slasher, except with better acting and effects.All of the characters were pretty likeable, though they weren't at first. You do grow to like them and want to see them all make it out. But if you know how slashers work, not all of them are coming out alive. One of the deaths legit had me upset because I really liked the character and their death seemed to most brutal.I can say I've never cried over a character death in a slasher film until this one. Take that for what it's worth.I really enjoyed this flick and look forward to parts 2 and 3.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
289,spam-778-616598,I really don't expect much from movies like this one ...,5,8 July 2021,"... but I absolutely hate it, when people simply act dumb in movies. There were too many silly decisions and plotholes. How does a story like that get approved from Netflix? I think I will give the second movie a try out of curiosity, but unfortunately I can't really recommend this one. The visuals and the actors were good, so I still give it 5 stars.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
290,cooler-16687,A horror movie for teens,6,28 August 2021,"It's not bad but it feels like something teenagers would appreciate.Pacing / editing is a bit too fast. Acting is... sus but kot overly bad , especially the blond guy that just has one facial expression: smiling.It doesn't feel scary at all and the love interests feel very akward.I know i sound pretty negative but for some reason i still think It's balancing between a 5 and a 6.. because like i said. I think this is more for younger people then older ones...",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
291,teacherianmitchell,"Fun, but there is better out there ...",6,21 July 2021,"A homage to Scream and Buffy, this is a pleasant nostalgic throwback to the 90s for anyone who grew up during that decade.It is not anything new - but it's entertaining enough if you like slasher movies.It's great if you are double-screening, but one to avoid if you are expecting anything particularly memorable.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
292,dcreal-75942,I was a 90's kid and this was absolutely accurate,9,3 July 2021,"Hilarious that jaded 90's people are so unhappy with this, and trying to pretend that this is some ""woke"" rip off.First, I was a 90's kid, and this absolutely resonated with me. These negative reviewers are stuck on the diverse cast (hint: 90's was filled with diverse people aka non-whites but Hollywood wouldn't put them in a movie for very long). Another hint: there were lesbians and plenty of goths in the 90s who were emo 24/7.Great soundtrack and threw in a lot of memories for me like AOL, the technics tape players and the mall.Good movie, can't wait to see the rest. People are way too overly critical these days. This was a fun ride with a story that will keep you entertained.Don't read the negative reviews by adults who are now miserable and trying to rewrite our history. Plenty of 90's kids grew up just like in this movie.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
293,adelectee,Its alright,5,23 July 2021,"I was really amped up on watching this as its new and the trailer looks good. However, i feel it could have been more gripping and had more substance. They added in loads of twists and turns and it has its comical side. But id say part two is much better then part one.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
294,michaelvandamme3,Walked in Blind and was Pleasantly Surprised,8,6 July 2021,"I knew nothing about Fear Street before watching it and damn was it good. I'm used to very low quality movies coming to Netflix so I couldn't believe it. I'm glad they're releasing all 3 movies a week apart rather than all at once. Alternatively, had this been a standalone film I would have also been content. It felt no different than any other movie I've watched only to have to wait 2-5 years for a sequel.It checks all the boxes for what it's trying to be. It's a fantastic blend of a mysterious drama and horror/slasher, with a splash of comedy and '90s nostalgia sprinkled throughout. I know this is vague, but they're all incorporated extremely well and the cast is near perfect. They all did a fantastic job. I feel like people disappointed with this film are either too young or too old to appreciate these genres in the given setting. For reference, I'm 26.I highly recommend Fear Street. It's rare we get an R rated horror movie and not just another PG one that's loaded with nonstop jump scares. Odds are and best case, you'll have 2 other full length movies to look forward to which are both coming very soon.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
295,myasinalfajry-28268,Boooooo!!!,6,14 July 2021,"Actually i don't have much expectation about this movie
But i think it's going to be atleast entertaining
But after i watch it
It's to flat... They acting it's to flat not bring any emotions at all
Good premis i think, but bad Excecution.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
296,jvenus-07339,Unwatchable,1,8 July 2021,Couldn't watch more than 13 minutes of this. Too many cliches. Maybe that's why I never got into the orginal Fear Street books too? I don't know but I couldn't watch it all it was that bad.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
297,nick9838,What's more frightening is there are 2 more to come!!,1,6 July 2021,"Well this had the feel of a Stranger Things type thing, but sadly it's totally lame.The script is as bad as the acting, and the acting is hopeless.Stay away from this dross.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
298,mmyilmazyurt,How editing and soundtrack ruins a movie.,4,3 July 2021,"Even though it has its promising moments Fear Street 1994 is far from reaching its potential. There is too many rapid transitions between songs, unnecessary sound effects (either for humorous or suspense moments) or just moments where the song is just too exploited where it could be on background.There was a sequence of the Shadyside vs Sunnyville that lead by Creep, showing how the years of tragedy effected the former town. Again this sequence is the only one in movie actually shows wealth difference and again done poorly by how the transitions were so rapid.Next is editing. For example, there is a scene where the sheriff is interrogating the victims aftermath and the cut scenes are too rapid again. (Like most of Nolan films which are a huge weak point for him too) Just let actors do their thing, process those moments for sake.I always distanced myself from horror but in recent years it became a new way of storytelling. If you want to adapt the trend of 90s into today, you have to blend it with narrative of today in order to do a great homage in my opinion.I am still looking forward to 1978 and 1666 but I am afraid we will hardly see an improvement because the main problems are rather technical that could have been solved with a feedback. A missed opportunity, unfortunately.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
299,Unprejudiced_Cinephile,Young blood in Peril.,6,5 July 2021,"(Edited)*** Spoiler Free Review, Always *** Jump to bottom for a Hot Take ***When I saw the title and Poster, I basically thought Another slasher don't we have enough of already. But then I read its an R. L. Stine adaption of the fear street series. Oh yeah, I used to rent them from the school library. I try to stay away from Hollywood's template depiction of high-school.It's the pacing that wins it the viewers attention.Some of the redone elements are here. And some identity politics template used in current times being super imposed onto the screenplay. Freaky, Happy death day and so many more in recent years. I don't mind this one all too much. Honestly I Fast-forwarded the template teen drama. If you it doesn't bother you, you might find this film mildly entertaining.**** Hot Take ****Pros : Smooth pacing. Thrilling. Fast Food Entertainment.Cons : Plot points are thrown in without logic or coherence. Not Grand plotting. Tried and trodden slasher jump scares. Some unnecessary HollyWood Representation drama thrown in.Noteworthy mention : I was exposed to 'Only happy when it rains' back in 96-ish or seven-ish. Not 95 and certainly not 94. I doubt it started playing on radio as early as 95 when it was released, it certainly wasn't in 94 that's for sure. Google confirms it.5 or 6 out of ten. I could go either way.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
300,tastingthestars,It's alright y'all are just mean,7,13 July 2021,"I think people are being way too harsh on this movie. It's not perfect by any means and there are a few confusing plot devices in it. But if you take away the things that don't make it good, there are still some great kills and some fun characters.Also, as a sapphic, the sapphic storyline is surprisingly good. Better than a lot of what Hollywood puts out and claims as ""representation."" I think I liked the second one more, but I can't deny that Sam and Deena were the best parts of the movie for me.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
301,averylubocki,What a let down...,3,3 July 2021,"I was really excited to see this movie and the two more following it. But this movie was so bad, I don't even wanna see the other two anymore. Visually it looked nice, the lighting in particular was fantastic. The acting was ok. The script was very lacklustre, and the dialogue was so bad at some points it made me cringe. Very little suspense. This movie follows every horror cliche in the book. Running time was way too long and body count was way too low. The characters ranged from boring to annoying. This movie was just a mess. I wanted to like it, but I couldn't. Check out ""Summer of 84"" if you want to watch a good nostalgia filled horror movie.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

304,sadikennt,Actually pretty good,8,11 July 2021,"As expected with today's horror movies it's kind of cheesy and the acting's isn't great throughout the whole movie but the story behind it is actually pretty good, I think it is well worth the watch. And the second one is better.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
305,Kerry_Bradford,Surprisingly good and perfect for Halloween!,9,27 September 2021,"I had heard alot about this movie/series from people around me but thought it was just going to be another generic slasher film. It is that but with so much more flare to it. All of the actors did a great job in their roles and I really loved the different killers that pursued them.For most part of the movie, I thought it was good but not GREAT but by the final act, I was giving this film alot more praise. It made some decisions with some of the characters that I felt most people wouldnt like but unpredictability always makes for the best movies. Can't go into too much detail without spoiling.I like the 90's vibe of this one but I am skeptical watching the other two installments since it seems to be going further back in time. I had my fill of old time slasher horror when I watched American Horror Story: 1984 but we'll see how this plays out.As for Fear Street 1994, I highly recommend watching for any horror fan, especially in the month of October to get you into those spooky vibes.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
306,rasull-ramad,What's with the bad rating?,7,18 July 2021,"Firstly, enjoy it for what it is. Its not a mission statement to be accurate. It is a tribute to the 70's slasher. I go to the movies to be entertained. This one did. Very few movies these days can get me hooked past the first 10 minutes. This one did.Now if you didn't enjoy it.. you can just quit watching. And don't even stop to bother writing bad reviews.Now why the haters??This movie was shot in 2019... and got stuck for release.It had everything i was looking for. Good production quality. Good actors. Good direction.Yes the music in the background can be a little too much or too loud.. but those are minor things.For those who think they can direct or make a better movie, please do. Do not act like you know.Some comments out there are just out to destroy this movie.In my opinion, this movie deserves a 7.It could have been higher if not for the minor hiccups.Mind you it is written by R L Stine.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
307,oceaneeringet,Pretty good sound track.,6,14 July 2021,"Well, starts off with a great sound track, brings back some memories. Then those in a little poor acting. Some great music mixed with bad music. At times you'll feel like you're watching ""scream"".Them LGBTQ shows up.At least watching Friday the 13th, and nightmare on elm street had some nudity. This just had some poor acting, a little humor.For a movie that had such Great potential. To let the LGBTQ take over the whole movie is a shame.I like the whole idea, it's an original one.I understand they are dumb teens but once they figure something and drive around in an ambulance and instead of choking her they decide to OD come on. Think they were too busy with the LGBTQ story to really think it out.A little better than it should have been, could have been a lot better with work, ending was pretty good.Did I mention the sound track is pretty good. Left a few out I would have don't believe I heard off spring.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
308,singakd,It's Meh... just OK,4,20 July 2021,"No one is smart in this trilogy, no one whatsoever! It's mediocre at best. Had potential but common sense is just missing in the script. They've taken Freddie, Jason, all 80s horror flicks and just mooshed them all together. Made quite a mess of it too.. How did the studio find budget to fund 3 of these horrific movies?! They could have used that money to make one really cool movie. Just because you put kids together in 80s or 90s setup that doesn't we would love it like Stranger Things. Try harder!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
309,kobrakai-1,Insufferably cynical,3,3 July 2021,"It takes less than twenty minutes for this movie to rattle off every millennial's basic childhood pop rock playlist. I'm not kidding-in twenty minutes I counted eight 90s songs used. Eight songs in twenty minutes, meaning the film will transition from playing Cypress Hill to Radiohead with as little rhyme or reason as someone just flicking through radio stations. This isn't nostalgia; it's cheap, it's cynical, and it's irritating, especially when it's the only thing the film gets even remotely right about the time period it's meant to take place in. Top it off with some seriously unlikable characters and it all makes for a film that felt like a rough 100 something minutes to sit through.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

311,teocrito,"Not horror, not even funny",2,4 July 2021,"I was looking forward to this three part movies. I didn't watch any trailer or anything because I didn't want to get my hopes high, but maybe I should have.The movie tries so hard to be funny and also coherent to the story that it achieved the contrary. It doesn't make any sense, specially the idea that the witch's bones are like that, on the surface of a nearby forest. Come on, almost four hundred years dead and the bones can be found so easily.And what about when they call the surviving girl? Is there always a telephone guide in a science classroom? Really stupid.But that's not all. Why don't they ""kill"" the girl in the ambulance while they are driving so the killers can't get them. It's stupid that more than six people die just to save from dying one girl.The script is terrible and formulaic. There is a reason why slasher movies aren't popular these days, because if you see one you have seen every one.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

314,Dinosaurkai12345,Why all the hate?,6,8 July 2021,"For a 'Scream' rip off i liked 'fear street'. It was interesting, and i like the addition of a lgbt and the characters weren't annoying as hell, however the director seemed to drag this film out and try making it longer with about 30 mins of the group running around or driving witch without these scenes, the film would be the same. I think they could have made this less obvious that it was stolen from 'Scream' such as the costume and the sudden dissappearences. But the story was good and the characters were interesting . I would definitely recommend watching this.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
315,T-xoo,Good movie for a weekend's night,6,3 July 2021,"The beginning is good. The killing and pace of the movie is constant. Then arrive 2/3 of the movie and it start to go slow. Then back to normal towards the ending. That's annoying. Just forwarded the film.The kids are kinda smart in the beginning and they unveil the truth to the viewer as well as keep their head cool. But the ending is just, well, dumb. The kids left their brains somewhere they don't remember. Not all part feel like the 90s. Overall it's a good Friday and Saturday night movie to watch.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
316,huntjohnjnr,Can only go up from here... I hope...,8,5 July 2021,"It's a good movie, a bit convoluted, but a nice start to the trilogy... I felt like they leaned way too much on the suspenseful music, like even when characters are doing normal things there's an eerily ominous music going on, Why!? The movie is set in the 90s but apart from the music and a few references, I honestly couldn't tell if it was the 90s or the 80s. And it just felt like a movie trying to be set in the 90s, and not like a 90s set movie.It's a great tribute to both the stories and classic slasher, love the practical effects, and sooo glad R L Stine adaptations are finally getting an R rating so they can really explore the horror and gore of it all without worrying about that PG rating... If anything, I hope these movies start a new R L Stine craze in Hollywood like with Stephen King. Stine has some great work, and with a budget and great writing, it could knock all these King adaptations out of the picture, or atleast equal them!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
317,rennmauslisa,Doesn't know what it wants to be,2,3 July 2021,"As I loved to read the Fear Street books growing up, I was quite excited to watch this movie, although sceptical.Well, the sceptic in me proved me right.The first 10 minutes or so are solid, but then it turns into absolute garbage. What bothered me most was that the movie didn't seem to could decide on a tonality. It's okay to have a slasher with comedy, but it's not okay to be brutally earnest in the one scene and try to pull some (unfunny) jokes in the next. That doesn't work, at least not for me.The characters are mostly unlikeable, the soundtrack sounds like a broken jukebox and there were at least (!) fifteen times I wanted to either stop watching or bang my head against the nearest wall. The characters were really THAT dumb.Sorry to be this harsh, but this movie isn't funny, it isn't scary and it builds zero atmosphere. A big letdown, sorry not sorry Netflix.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

For a movie lacking stars, they did exceedingly well to satisfy my blood thirst and that's not something you see frequently. In Truth, this movie is a 7 but because of a myopic minded fellow who rated it poorly because they were busy counting the music scores used, I give it an 8 as countermeasure.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

I am sure the actor doesn't even know who Bruce Dickenson is. Then, you start tossing in a mixed bag of select 90s grunge hits to make the boring plot seem less bland. Didn't work. I paused this movie more times then I can remember. Simply found it relentlessly trying, painful to get thru, boring kill scenes, and laughable at best acting.

If you real are big on 90s nostalgia I wouldn't recommend this movie. If you don't really care about that then you will enjoy it.

The lead characters are far more annoying than likeable and incredibly selfish.

I dropped a star every time there was a cringeworthy scene from horrific writing/acting/directing. I got to 1 star pretty quickly. I gave it a bump to 2 stars since the soundtrack was on point. Should've leaned into a more comedic tone and it may have been decent. Since it did not and tried to actually be a nostalgic horror it becomes a non scary unwatchable whatever.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
329,water_bug2,This is a genius idea,8,4 July 2021,"First, I don't get all the whining about it not being 90s enough. If what you wanted was a 90s horror movie, dry your tears and go watch Scream. I was a teen in the 90s too; we weren't that special. When we weren't resurrecting 70s style,we wore jeans and t-shirts. Unless you're reminiscing for the late 90s fashion craze of putting everything in display, I think the wardrobe choices were appropriate.Regarding the content, it was a pretty decent film; I enjoyed the more modern take on the genre. I think I know where the story is heading (I haven't read the books), but I hope to be surprised. After all, I was not expecting the bread slicer, so they may have more unexpected twists up their sleeves.What the movie did well was play to the audience. The Easter eggs (some obvious, some more subtle), the references to other horror movies (again, some obvious and some more subtle), and the set-up for the next film are all perfect for streaming audiences. Releasing the movies in short intervals and in reverse order is a fantastic strategy sure to keep viewers engaged well after July 16. It's certainly not the scariest or best executed horror movie I've seen but it got me excited to watch the next two films, so kudos.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

332,tankboy-46851,Pleasantly surprised,7,6 July 2021,From the Netflix previews I figured this was going to be geared to young teens and kinda tame. I was happy to be totally wrong!I grew up in the 90's and read all the Fear Street books (bought from the bookstore in the mall no less). You can tell the director/writer had some love for these stories too. They wove a pretty good story with the source material.I loved all the nods to 90's slashers like Scream. It was done well. You'd expect stuff like that to be sort of cringe... but it didn't come off like that at all.Super entertaining. I'll be looking forward to part II.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
333,diehls-08027,Meandering and poorly made,3,2 August 2021,"I agree with the negative reviews and issues mentioned, including plot holes, unlikeable characters, and poor 90's vibe. In addition I'd add that the nighttime scenes (or in dark rooms or underground ) were way too dark and often the screen was basically black for long periods . I saw all three movies, so maybe this occurred more in 2 and 3, but it was annoying. I also would delicately mention that the wokeness was distracting because it felt contrived.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
334,doriangray-34752,Lame. Are the constantly dark scenes to hide the set quality,4,5 July 2021,"This is really lame. Maybe would've been a bit better if the actors were college students or smth rather than children. Or maybe the movie is made for children. And the awful constantly dark scenes in the movie are really annoying. U can't see 80% of the scene buried in darkness, I think directors are using this technique more n more recently to save cost and hide how weak and lacking in quality the set really is. All in all I doubt I'll even finish this movie as it's not interesting at all and the actors are just kids with the same expressions all the time everywhere. And not finishing a movie or a book means that it was extremely bad I didn't even care to know what'll happen.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
335,gouldgang,A lot of fun!!,6,18 July 2021,I don't get all the negative reviews? Almost stopped me from watching but I figured I'd give it a whirl. I went into it with low expectations and maybe that's why I enjoyed it as much as I did. But not a bad movie at all. Is it a masterpiece? Obviously not. But I don't know who would expect a teen horror movie produced by Netflix to be. It was very entertaining and campy fun. I found most of the characters insufferable at the beginning but by the end they all grew on me and I was sad to see em go. I think the most important thing in a movie is it's entertainment value and I was never bored watching this one. If you like horror and don't mind some corny moments and slightly questionable acting give it a try. It's not terrifying or thought provoking by any means but it's an easy entertaining watch. And with the silver lining of not being too profoundly horrifying you hopefully shouldn't lose any sleep from the things that go bump in the night!,Fear Street - Part One - 1994

342,tinydracula,Not even close.,3,3 July 2021,"I'll be brief I've read all the fear street books. And this isn't even good enough to be a parody of them. None of these actors are believable. You're getting chased by supernatural killers. What should we do? Let's have sex and make out in the bathroom. Let's make cringe jokes, let's make a Jason Mewes wanna be say the F word a lot and hope it counts as a personality trait. One thing that really bothered me was back in the 90's we didn't have the ""such and such is typing feature."" Heck there's a bunch of scenes where they're on the phone AND the internet simultaneously! That's not how it worked back then! Who did they hire to ok this crap?? The story was boring, characters without charm, a love story nobody wanted, and to top it all off I can't remember the last time I was so built up for something only to feel like I got slapped in the face with a big ol' wiener.

The opening of the film leaves so much promise, and yet we are then subjected to unnecessary amounts of Teenage Drama. In a movie that is suppose to be set in 1994, we instead get a 2021 teenage angst drama where teens care more about high school problems than literally running from killers...On top of that, the entire middle section, just feels like you're waiting for something.....ANYTHING....to happen. The introduction tries to set the tone with a wonderful throwback slasher scene, and The ending doesn't disappoint with a couple of gnarly kills and an ending that leaves JUST ENOUGH to make you want to tune into Part 2.So even though the entire middle sucks...the fact that I had enough interest to return to the sequel feels deserving (barely...of a 5)",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

347,jakerchief,Not in my wheelhouse but it's okay,5,11 July 2021,"So let's get this out of the way, I'm 40 years old and I was 13 in 1994. So the first 20 minutes is legit a cringe fest of ""Let's shove as much music in here as possible"" but in reality everyone was either listening to Seattle rock or West Coast rap. Also, the late 60's/early 70's was huge in '94 so in reality there'd be a lot of The Doors and Led Zeppelin playing. Okay so let's get past that and in to the actual movie that starts after ""The bus incident"". So this still has RL Stein written all over it, just with far more curse words like what actual teenagers talk like than what they talk like in Goosebumps. The lighting, sound, and production value is done really well for a low-budget teen-slasher. The acting is great and the editing is decent. The music still has that classic RL Stein cheapness to it that kinda works. It makes for a great Netflix movie, so it can have a fair amount of blood and cursing.It's truly on par with the movies like Urban Legend, I know What you Did Last Summer, and The Faculty; however it is no where near the movie it's ripping off which is Scream.If I was 12-15 again and watching this I'd actually like it, but being 40 I tend to nitpick on certain directional, editing, and dialogue issues.Once you can get past the first 20 minutes and see the movie for what it's worth, it's honestly not that bad.Would I recommend this movie to my friends? No. God no. But if my friends my age are asking for horror movie recommendations for something to watch with their adolescent kids, I'd say sure.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

It just throws so much at you like it's going a thousand miles and hour and there's a song or music every five seconds. I mean in a five second period they switched the song four times. Don't get me wrong I love music in movies but Jesus they didn't even give the actors time to speak until they played another song to say hey this is the 90's don't you live it?! Teenagers didn't act like this in the 90's they didn't act like people do now that's just that. I get it times have changed in 20 plus years but if you're making a time period movie act like it you can't just add music Tina movie and say this is the 90's and go with it. Now about the plot and movie in general it was just bad. Nothing made since was it a slasher, supernatural, thriller? No all three plus more okay no just give me a real good one of those not all of them. If you're going to hype and movie up this much and give it a big budget don't let a new director shoot it because rather or not who they are where they come from they didn't know how to handle the way this movie needed to be. Editing was off, to many close ups, to many cuts, actors had an off ness about them.

I don't understand why all the kids put Sam's blood on themselves to lure the killers to them. That made absolutely no sense whatsoever other than to have bloody murders happen. Would never happen, but when Deena ""overpowered"" and tied up a demon witch with a phone cord, which also would never happen, you knew a Part Two was coming.

I didn't feel not one bit sorry for them when they were ""cut up"". Then when Deena overpowers Sam when she's a possessed demon witch, with a telephone cord no less, that really cinched the stupidity! That would never happen in a million years.

Then the story began to form and got introduced to the rag tag group of teenagers and all their melodrama (And not good melodrama, reality tv badly scripted melodrama). This movie could have been interesting but they really half arsed the whole 1994 setting as the only 90s thing was the soundtrack and the AOL chat.

The leads were almost unbearable to watch because none of them had any redeemable qualities and were flat out annoying.

The very same thing happened here.Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer were gripping thrillers that kept you on the edge of the seat. Fear Street doesn't come even close. It starts as a joke and continues as an even worse one. Cliches all around. Unnecessary 90's bangers for every scene. Over-caricatured characters. Illogical actions and consequences.

My issue was the teenagers making the most idiotic decisions and it drove me just about crazy. I was so annoyed that I just fast forwarded thru the last 13 minutes until I got to the final 3.I mean why not stand around and debate as the killers advance within a foot of you and THEN run, or completely stop what you're doing to have underaged sex.......while undead murderers are actively hunting for you and can show up at any moment.And if the possessed killers are attracted to her blood why do you have to smear it on your clothes and wear it? Putting yourself at risk to be killed. They've pretty much ignored you thru most of the movie so why make yourself a target when they are clearly only after one person? Just soak a shirt in her blood, leave it like a hundred miles away so that the killers wonder off in the wrong direction, stop the girl's heart, bring her back and be done.I'm still very much interested in the next 2 movies in the trilogy.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

And she dripped some blood into a bucket of water and they were able to make blood trails all over the school with mops? Doesn't really work that way. And I know it's a horror film, but I can't stand when in the midst of something tragic/ horrible/ escaping from the bad guy, people decide to have sex, or in this case, pleasure themselves as well. Maybe it's just me, but takes me out of the movie. Also, I graduates high school in 1994, so I am very familiar with it, and nothing in this film really screamed 1994. Yeah, music (most of which was anachronistic), and old school computers, but something about the dialogue did not evoke feelings of the 90s.

All of the people complaining how it's not entirely accurate to the 90s are just looking for too much to complain about. It's not Stranger Things. It's not really trying to throwback and honor the amazing sci-fi movies of the 80s. The setting being in 1994 is surely there to create some nostalgia, but as some people pointed out, it could also be set in current times as well, meaning it's not overtly trying to honor the time period as ST masterfully does,",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

373,dillonjeffers-52163,Fear Street 1994 Part 1... ok,6,5 July 2021,This film is absolutely an ok film. It's not great. But I did enjoy it. Also I've seen lots of low reviews. There's three parts. Just throwing that out there.For the most part this film is just a slasher and when those parts come up it's a really good time. The story though is really choppy. Hopefully the next part will fix everything. Cause the film is about a cursed town with a witch that wants revenge... so far. Honestly that's cool maybe there could be a twist.Also the characters are not the best. I really didn't find myself really liking any of them. Other than the young computer hacker and the good cop. It's probably the most disappointing part about this film. The rest of the characters just had an angry/ hate feel. The film makers throw you a group to care for but honestly they didn't do a good job at making me care for them.Over all tho it's good. If you like fast pacing and a crazy killer. Then you'll have no problems. Just don't forget there's two more parts. Then again it could get worse... for the first part I think a 6/10 or even a 5 is good. This isn't a big screen movie.

381,shaughnpatrickrice-19191,Gives me the fear that Netflix green lit 3 of these but canceled daybreak after season 1,2,3 July 2021,"I can accept some confusion, this is meant to be the first (but chronologically last) of a trilogy. That's acceptable. What isn't acceptable is everything else.The editting, specifically sound editting, is the worst I may have seen in any film. Songs will play out of no where, either as hamfisted nods to what will happen or for no actually reason other than to wake up anyone who may have fallen asleep. In one case, it's used in place of telling the audience what the characters are planning to do. Also, commits the sin of all modern horror, blurring strings = scary. Not that any of the other editting is noteworthy. It ranges from servicible to awful.The script is poor, characters and relationships are awfully written. All characters make completely illogical decisions. Also, the story is beyond rushed.The effects + kills are lacklustre, with one exception, which may be the only few seconds (barring the jarring, nonsensical inclusion of song snipits I liked) I enjoyedAs a first taste of what's to come, this is a bafflingly awful, dire attempt. Surely, it can't get worse... Right? RIGHT?",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
382,odmorales,Well...that's all folks!!,5,4 July 2021,"Fear Street, a book which is known for many 90 teens. It's one of the most fun books that have been done by the creator R. L. Stone, which who's primarily known for Goosebumps. Well, I was so anticipated when I heard that Netflix were making three tales from Fear Street into movies. Yadda...yadda...yadda.Now about the movie. Going to lay it down simple. It had it's fun moments, but seriously whose idea was to have a main character that no one cares (well, I didn't)? I'm not going to lie, it seems that they didn't think much about it. Definitely the director and writer needed more time to fix the script, especially when the whole story is all over the place. Obviously, the way it seems, the movies are going to connect. And maybe that's the reason the movie didn't make sense. Who knows? Hopefully the other tales, movies, are better. Other thing that grinds my gears is the overplayed nostalgia music. I get it. It's the 90s, but c'mon! Is it necessary to have a song after song from the 90s, even when it didn't transition well with the scene? I guess they're trying their best to let the audience know that there in the 90s. The good parts were mainly the kills, but other than that, its pretty much forgettable. And they didn't know how to build up the tense. Don't get me wrong. I love horror movies but I also care about the story, especially the characters. Unless, if it's a dumb slasher movie like one of the Friday the 13th. You know what? That's probably what they were going for. But let me go back. Certainly the first movie before their sequels like Scream, ANOES, Halloween, Jeepers Creepers stories are the BEST. Why couldn't this one be like those!? Yet, I can't forget that its Netflix. They tend to make B grade level movies. Oh, well, I digress. Just leaving my two cents. Maybe, you guys will like it more than I did.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
383,WinterEcho,It didn't have the 90s feeling like it said. So much made no sense,5,5 July 2021,"I wanted to like this so much, but it has so many errors and weird issues with it. It's the type of movie people will point out stuff nonstop that makes no sense.I don't want to say anything ruining the story, but it's also weird this is a trilogy yet this movie kinda says everything that happens and who survives the other movies. Maybe there will still be some surprises in them though. Like it's weird to show the ending then say everything that happens before instead of letting those stories play out and leave surprises for them.The whole movie also had a blue and dark filter over it which I didn't like. Even when they were in lightly lit rooms or looked like they were by a nightlight.Just putting a dark filter over the whole movie doesn't make it scary.Other than various 90s songs at the beginning almost none of it felt like a 90s movie or setting. Even literally copying a scene from Scream never gave that impression.I was just really disappointed in this and it had so much potential that just feels completely wasted.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

388,tymoody,Goosebumps with Gore,5,20 July 2021,"The original 90s series was darker than this film and the books written by R. L. Stein. It has about the same type of writing as a goosebumps episode, which is not a very good thing considering this is rated TV-MA. The story was very unrealistic even if it was based on the paranormal. For example, two high schools going to a candlelight vigil and starting a fight? Or the cop acting as if the car accident was an ongoing investigation even though everyone was alive and they all said it was an accident? These characters make the dumbest decisions even for a horror film and not many characters are that likeable. If you need some brainless stuff to watch and are not the genre maybe give it a try but other than that, there are many more scary things to watch on Netflix. This having the same rating as content such as Haunting of Hill House is almost laughable. They should have gone with a less violent TV-14 movie since this is clearly the age range it was directed at. Slightly disappointed but if your expectations aren't high it may be okay for you.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
389,U2bum,First review was pulled without notice... that's odd,5,29 July 2021,"My first review was pulled without any notice and I'm not sure why. Well, I can guess. It contained no spoilers but it did point out that the first 22 minutes of the film have almost nothing to do with the plot and drives home the fact that there are two towns that have each other. One is the rich, elite comprised of nonPOC and the second town is poor, held done POC. They even come to blows (fight) over this. There is a subplot of the sane idea (POC/nonPOC) between characters as well. Also, they push LBGTQ+ on you as well. Now we get to the movie.Overall, it's not a bad horror flick. It had me yelling at the TV and asking were all the adults were like many slasher films of the past. There are some unfinished plot lines which is to be expected since its know to be the first installment. If you can make it past the first 22 minutes, stick it out.Let's hope this one doesn't get taken down.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

393,yoshinaruto,The definition of a mixed bag,6,3 July 2021,"I didn't read the Fear Street books growing up, although I did read Goosebumps. Considering this was an R rated adaptation, I was cautiously optimistic.I loved the opening scene. It felt like a nice call back to Scream. It wasn't nearly as iconic, but it did enough right to set my expectations high. Then the plot starts developing, and it goes downhill fast.The characters are mostly annoying. I could argue I mildly liked two of them, but that's it. The protagonist is incredibly self absorbed, and treats her ex horribly. We've got the nerdy kid who knows literally everything. The comic relief who has maybe two lines in the movie that aren't jokes. Etc.Then there's the tone. The best way I could describe it is the kid friendly feel of the Goosebumps movie mixed with a slasher film. Anytime someone isn't being murdered, it's really light in tone and kinda jarring. The profanity and innuendos are present during these scenes, but they still feel very kiddish, for lack of a better word. The closest example I could think of for a movie like this is ""Summer of '84"", but that wasn't nearly as light, and it was far more consistent.The 90's music, while good, is heavily overused. The early parts of the film feel like someone turned on a malfunctioning jukebox that switches songs every ten seconds. Sometimes less is more.The horror scenes are actually really good. The opening scene and climax are my favorites, but I enjoyed the rest as well. If the entire film was as good as the horror, I'd honestly consider giving this a 9/10, but I kept getting taken out of the film when there was downtime. There was very little tension or decent drama, just an overly quick pace with humor and exposition to bridge the scares.It's on Netflix, so if you're interested I guess it's worth a shot. I'm disappointed, as it could've been an absolute classic, but if it sounds like your kinda thing you might like it.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

We get it, you played 90s music, but nothing else felt 90s. I grew up in the 90s and was hoping for the nostalgia feels with some horror (which Stranger Things did extremely well with the 80s). The story is uninteresting and none of the characters are likeable, except the younger brother nerd. The first 5 minutes were a good hook, but that was it. If you want 90s cheese, watch Scream; at least it knew what kind of movie it was trying to be. I know the 90s were angsty, but the characters in here are downright depressing and a little psycho to the extreme for teenagers.

397,Matt_bobco,Don't bother,2,16 July 2021,"Starts fairly strongly, with an interesting premise. But as soon as the actual characters are introduced it falls apart. Acting and writing is appalling, coming across like a low budget TV series. Cinematography is execrable and relies on close-ups and fast cuts to mask the poor framing, choreography and acting. The music is almost entirely anachronistic - which undermines the *entire* point of setting a movie in a specific year. Even worse, the music is misused so it never manages to have an emotional impact - a complete waste of licensing arrangements. Fans of the RL Stine book series will be embarrassed, while fans of horror and slasher films will just be bored. Don't bother.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

This isn't based on one specific book and every title sans their own sequels, tell a different story with different characters. But they all had a common bond. Something bad always happens in Shadyside.The movie follows that connection and tries to add a ""why"" and further connection. It would have been redundant to do the ""books came to life"" that Goosebumps and SSTITD did... So they went a different route...Like the books there were lots of twists. The characters were likable. I loved that the lead character was gay without it feeling forced or contrived. She did a good job.This movie is NOT for kids. Gore and violence is one thing but there's a lot of borderline scenes, some nudity and innuendos. Here in the states violence is okay but sex is not lol. But Goosebumps or even SSTITD, this is not.This is probably gorier than Scream and IKWYDLS, but not too over the top. Definitely more than I expected and there's a particularly gruesome scene towards the end that gave me ""The Intruder"" vibes.All in all, a slasher film trying to do more and supernatural elements added in for flavor.

The kids steal an ambulance and no one gives a damn. For god sakes, the car that crashed in the woods was still there a day later, the police or the insurance, or the owners, no one gave a damn about the car being left there.I would say the movie begins quite nice, if it wasn't a Scream ripoff, -sorry, ""homage"" or whatever- for 20 minutes (mall intro + school scenes), it doesn't help that the music sounds like possible scraps Marco Beltrami did for Scream.The movie is quite a mess, a well disguised mess, thanks to a Netflix budget.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

Horror movies often struggle with characters that make dumb or out of character decisions and this was no exception. Near the end, a few of the main cast do a dumb plan to save one of their friends. It could have very easily resulted in no loss of life had they abided by the rules set up not half an hour earlier, but instead the plan resulted in several unnecessary deaths. Horror is not a genra where all of the main cast is expected to live, but this seemed only as a purpose to add some gore to the climax.

422,satriaadhika,"""Fear Street Part One: 1994"" Review, Fighting the Terror of the Scary and Thrilling Shadyside City",7,7 July 2021,"The first minutes of this film are immediately opened with a tense atmosphere. Opened with terror in a mall that attacks a bookstore employee, the audience seems to have been given a guarantee that this film will provide a scary experience.Even at the beginning of the film, viewers who haven't read the novel may feel a little surprised by the mysterious figure chasing the employee. The description of the atmosphere, starting from the musical score to the small details presented successfully made the audience feel tense.From what I have seen so far, almost a number of Netflix original films have started to dare to raise LGBT issues. For the author himself, it feels quite disturbing. Viewers who are not used to watching this themed film may feel a little disturbed. Fortunately, this film focuses more on horror and thriller nuances than romance.In this first series, it appears dominantly and becomes the main premise of a story that is quite bold by putting forward the two main protagonists of a lesbian couple. But in practice, the sexual elements in the first series are still quite shy, and almost their relationship is explained through a dialogue. Fortunately, the romance portion is presented sufficiently without looking too much. This is what made the writer decide to continue this film.In addition, like American teen films in general, the language and words presented tend to be dirty and rude. This film is indeed intended for teenage and adult audiences, compared to ""Goosebumps"" which can still be watched by children.The three killers carried out their actions with sadistic and totality. So that the teenagers who try to fight it also have difficulty, even many have become victims. How their costumes, voices, and movements succeeded in making the audience feel the creepy atmosphere in the film.Yes! This horror thriller film is a film that relies on a fairly dominating musical score. Almost in every spooky scene and when the ghost comes, it is always given tense music. So the atmosphere in this film feels less natural.In addition, the soundtracks of 90s songs also make this film more colorful.Unfortunately, although the thriller and horror elements are quite good in this film, there are still aspects that make this film feel unsatisfactory. One of them is the characters in the film. All the characters in this film seem to just be ""victims"" of murder and the audience will not feel sympathy for the players.In fact, if this film lengthens its duration a little and makes a little flashback or deepens the characterization of the characters, the audience will definitely feel emotional. Like conjuring films or other western horror films.The cinematography presented in this film tends to be dark. The depiction and set up of the 90s location actually looks not very realistic. Some of the highlighted spots look too modern for the 90s.Overall, ""Fear Street Part One: 1994"" is quite qualified to be a summer rollercoaster thriller that is suitable and enjoyable as a spectacle for entertainment, without requiring us to involve excessive reasoning.""Fear Street Part One: 1994"" managed to open the parade of Netflix's horror trilogy quite well.

I didn't expect them to actually kill Kate but they still did, and the way she died really added on the shock value. Or maybe I just haven't watched enough horror movies in my life because I was really amazed and shocked by that scene. This is just one of the very few horror movies that I actually properly watched because every single one of my friends were talking about it, and it was exactly as I was expecting, it's like those quirky cliche high school horror movies that cater to their gen z audience hungry for adventureI'm gay so I quiet enjoyed watching this.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

It was overly cringey in some parts as well and it didn't give me a 90s vibe at all. I got quite bored half way through if I'm being honest. There was a twist near the end when I thought it was wrapping up which was probably one of the best things about it, but then it went a bit weird again before it finished. The actors were very good and the preview for the second one looks like it might be good so will probably still watch that, as that will probably explain a bit more than this one has.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
426,dazzerdutch,Nowhere near as bad as some of these reviews say,7,15 July 2021,Yes it's not amazing but it's definitely not a 1-3 star movie. In these times of very few releases this trilogy is a welcome to many a film buff.The actors are all very good. Yes there's a bit of overkill on 90's music in the first half but that soon fades away when the killing starts.Lots of unnecessary swearing makes this a 18 rather than the horror.Yes it copies every horror genre but it's admits that and doesn't try to hide it.I haven't watched the other two but this could become a cult trilogy and could surprise lots of people.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994

431,Kenjislamberry,its a fun slasher movie but I expected better,7,6 July 2021,"I had only found about this movie only a month ago . I never read the fear street novels growing up . I only read goosebumps . I was interested in watching because of R. L. Stine . The opening scene was pretty well done it reminded me of Scream . I found the the two of the lead characters were unlikable . Deana is a clingy girlfriend and Sam was just boring . I didn't really care for Deana and Sam . Deana and Sam are not a good representation for LGBT characters . Their romance is the typical melodramatic teen romance . It should have been done better . I wasn't expecting Kate and Simon to get killed off so quickly . Its dumb how easily they got killed . Kate was chocked and pushed through a bread slicer and Simon died with a quick axe to the head . I was surprised no one tried to save Kate and Simon. I'm a bit sad Kate and Simon got killed off in the first part . They were the most likeable characters in the movie . As far as being scary it wasn't scary enough . The gore however was done well . The pacing and story also could have been better . They should have given Deena and Sam more character development . I hope the last two parts have better pacing , more character development , more horror and gore . I found the movie still entertaining and fun so I'm giving it 7/10.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

There are a few that do not suck as much and of course they die horribly.. The heroine is far from being likeable, the ending is absurd and the reverse timeline is definitely not smart, at the end of the movie we see most of the things that are happening in the sequel.

Neither the music, not the dress and makeup and definitely not the way they spoke.Good concept with too many problem in the long story.Pros: Decent acting except the leading actress Khana Madeira.

This just didn't feel like 94. I'm not sure if the creators thought cramming up 90s songs right after the other without any context would bring the 90s vibe?

443,gyounce,"Sadly, just did not feel like Fear Street.",4,3 July 2021,"I went in to this with high hopes. As a fan of the Fear Street books and R. L Stine, I was severely let down. The magic of teen horror was replaced with, what felt like a desperate attempt to replicate the Scream or Slasher series.The plot line was a bit boring and far too predictable to feel fresh. As well, the character development was missing something, like...character. I honestly only cared if one character lived or died, and that was Josh.The movie falls flat in bringing any special feelings that we had reading the books as teens. It felt like it was trying too hard to be a horror/slasher movie that catered to an adult crowd who wants to see teen sex with their horror. The innocence of that hint of sexuality was nowhere to be found.The sex, and drug usage was definitely adult material. The characters are supposed to be teens but that is where the similarities end. The scenes for the next movie show a teen girl getting pounded in a sex scene and a half naked girl in an open jean jacket.I'm not sure I have the stomach to watch the other two installments. I really got excited when I started hearing about the Fear Street movies. Unfortunately, I think this movie might have been one street over.

However, after the pointless funeral scene on the football field you eventually begin to like the characters so much that their deaths hit really hard, especially the deli meat kill that had me in shock.

I couldn't get past the first 30 mins. I was so excited and wanted to love them, but fear street this was not and 90s it was not (except music).

449,thatvikingchick,dont expect the books,6,11 July 2021,"I liked this. It was ok. I especially liked the small references to RL Stine in the beginning...but it is nothing like his books. I have only seen this movie and the second one so far. The first movie is the truest to RL Stine because it is horror that doesnt go too far (although it is still a bit out of scope). The second movie is basically a slasher flick that feels like filler between the first and the third movie. Still all RL Stine books about Fear Street are more like mysteries/suspense and the incidents take place on a particular street where bad things seem to just happen for unknown reasons. Yes there are teens who get murdered. But the ending is usually a surprise and there is more of a plot to the books and detective work on the part of the reader. I hope that the last movie delivers something a bit more substantial than a slasher flick. In RL Stines books, the characters do undergo some sort of development and there are even sometimes romantic subplots. I guess we will see what unfolds.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

453,Howaitopawa,Not Interesting,2,26 August 2021,"The movie failed to grab my attention at most points.The beginning was too fast to get a true understanding of the characters. The movie used songs and band posters to signify that it was the 1990's, but that is all they did to show that.The characters are not likable, I never felt a connection to the characters and was anticipating when they would die. Characters have a sex scene that made no sense to have, but sex appeal.The villains fell super flat. There was no motivation from them to hunt, but just because they are monsters after one person that was it.It tried to do what strangers things succeeded at, but failed miserably. Different story twists and nostalgia never got through to the intend audience.Hopefully the prequel can redeem the series in some way.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
454,Moonstone55,Entertaining Enough,7,3 July 2021,"The problem with movies like this, is we all grew up with the books and have an idea of how the visual adaption should be. Personally I would have rather seen something based off the Fear Street Sagas, like the Betrayal.That being said, this was decent enough, although not without it's flaws. It's a good evening popcorn flick, as long as you don't overthink it.I do agree with some of the main complaints about it not feeling like the 90's though. Just simply cramming 90's songs one after the other, does not achieve that effect.

The wardrobe was not authentic. I wish the producers would cast actors closer to the age of the characters. The main actress is 28 and she is playing a high schooler? The relationship between the two women seemed very forced and not realistic at all.I remember the movie Scream which kept you on the edge of your seat. This show definitely did not command your full attention. The plot was kind of interesting but also frustrating. I plan to watch the second part to see if it improves.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

I also was a 90s baby so that probably makes me a little more judgmental when they make a movie about the decade I grew up in.First off, the main character Deena is EXTREMELY unlikable. She's a whiny little brat and is mean to everyone around her. She breaks up with her girlfriend because she moved to a town 30 minutes away, I guess cars didn't exist in the 90s? Then she guilt trips/shames her ex girlfriend for not coming out publicly. Like straight up berates her. The really only likable characters were Josh the little brother, and Simon.Secondly, they really try to ham fist in 90s nostalgia. It's not 1994 just because you play random songs from the 90s. Honestly the only thing that gives it away that it doesn't take place in the present is the fact no one has cellphones.Overall I think if they just set this in present day and not based it on a pretty beloved children's book series it probably wouldn't have been such a disappointment. It's not the worst movie I've ever seen by any means but just not what I was hoping for.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

But still I have some thoughts: Why do the ppl in this movie (particularly the first half) just not care at all about what's going on around them and take nothing seriously. And it's not in a sarcastic commentary way like Heathers or Scream. The ""sexy"" bathroom wash up scene was so out of place after having literally been chased by undead serial killers. Speaking of which, most of the time it feels as if the ghosts are right at their heels but other moments they can take so long to arrive.

Oh man that's what I call meta-language, right?"". It's a lot like ""Scream"" hit from the 90s, but the very very worse version!It's so cliche. I ended to watch it wondering if they wanted to do a funny movie? But ...no it's not funny. It's not scary either. It's almost scary, almost funny, so it gets lost in the middle, aka ridiculous.I mean...Where are all the people on that movie? Don't that children have parents for god sake? So a killer is hunting them and they decide to go the road with a stolen ambulance. Common, really? Some babies decide to break in on the school, on the supermarket without getting help of no adult?

This movie also has a plethora of other issues such as; making random things jumpscares (28, my friend counted), and all of the writing fails to be 'scary.' The way it's written just feels like the Goosebumps movie, but with blood and sex. The beginning did not introduce characters very well, and I felt no reason to like any of the characters because all of them were bad people. (A few exceptions) The scene where they all randomly decided to have intercourse also felt very shoehorned in so they could distract from bad writing. Overall, I didn't enjoy this movie really at all. I went in with my expectations pretty low because it was a Netflix original, but it was worse than I expected. There's also the big issue where they are constantly playing 90's music over like every scene. One major thing the film lacked is suspense. There was no way anything could feel suspenseful, because there was always 90's music playing. Finally, the plot was incredibly predictable and boring.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

Imagine throwing a few curse words and some unnecessary themes into an R. L. Stine book, and it will be just as you would assume. It just sucks, honestly.

483,shellmine,10/10 for the genre,7,20 July 2021,"The genre is not horror, but pre-horror; an amalgamation of cliches with backstory, suspense and a twist. Almost a playful transition genre into horror/gore. Anyone going into this expecting anything else is delusional. It would be like going into a Steve King film and being discomfited by a crazed author protagonist or a child with telekentic proclivities. RL Stine is the master of broad horror and capturing fragments in time for gratuitous entertainment. If, while watching this, for even a minute, you regressed to a sulky tween who's a slave to scheduled television, or laughed once at a cheesy horror motif, this series has done it's job.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

I found the music was all over the place which made it difficult to know how the film was supposed to make you feel. I'm not sure the director knew what genre of film they wanted to make.A lot of people seem angry that there is a varied cast & LGBT, however, I can't say I've seen many slashers/ horrors with LGBT cast so kudos to the writers.Overall, this is an entertaining slasher for viewers not seeking much depth.

I agree that the characters were unlikeable and the lesbian theme was a bit heavy handed though necessary since the tension hinged on it. Did viewers think the makers could hit the 90s accurately? Even Spielberg missed the mark with Crystal Skrulls' historical accuracy. Horror fans are difficult to please because they've seen everything but casual horror viewers like me can still get the chills. Uncomfortable to watch if I had a date though - the kids in the movie looked so young.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
489,goelp-32768,Something new in the Horror genre.,9,2 August 2021,"So, I guess this is the best movie I've recently watched as some movies (Black Widow) didn't meet my expectations, but this movie gave me the ultimate pleasure of watching something good and spooky.So, to start with the movie and its screenplay, everything was fabulous. The writing was amazing, and the story was kinda spooky and I really loved it. The acting of actors was something that kept me hooked till the end and I could feel being there, with them and experiencing everything. So, the story and acting were unrealistic.The story takes us back to 1994 and revolves around a town named Shadyside, and its serial killings. Some people here go insane and roam around killing innocent people, so it's also named as the Killer capital of the USA. The back story was amazing and I could feel the temptation to dig more and more. I loved every character and their acting was to-the-point, not so damn overacting and not under-acting. This movie is something new in the horror genre, and I guess it's going to inspire more and more people.Now let's get to the ratings of this movie. I will rate this movie a full 10/10, well maybe I'm being a little generous, but it is what it is. And it's adult (Of course, Netflix), so better watch it alone to experience that thrill and horror in your bones.So, that was all about this movie. It's a must-watch, so don't just sit there, go get some popcorns, and Netflix and chill with this astonishing movie.To summarise, a new genre in the horror genre, loved it. Must watch for all the horror and mystery suckers out there.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

494,Asshole-68383,What...was this?,1,12 July 2021,"I created an account because of how irritated I was with this movie.I'm a huge horror fan, but I don't think of myself as super serious about the genre. Give me a bad B movie and I'm totally happy but this was just...beyond.Let's just start with the fact that the movie doesn't even follow it's own rules. I won't spoilt it, but they clearly state why the killers are killing and then the killers go against that statement.And I really agree with another review. This movie felt like how a Gen-Z kid THINKS 90s kids acted and dressed. Never did it feel like it was actually set in the 90s not even when they shoved 20 90s songs (a lot of which were released after 1994) down our throats in the first 20 minutes. If these kids were almost 18 in 1994 that means they were born at the end of the 70s and grew up in the 80s. That's a totally different vibe than kids that were born later in the 80s.It also had so many real-life plot goofs. How did Deena answer the phone when her brother was on AOL? That was impossible at the time. Someone in the writer's room had to know that. Also why did they choose that method to kill someone? It would literally take close to an hour. Shooting up someone with 8 epipens would also probably kill them before it would save them.Everything from the acting to the story was cringe. The only thing I enjoyed was the opening scene but that's only because it was lifted right from Scream.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The acting is extremely bad (especially the main actresses) and not convincing, at no point did I feel that horror, or any form of tension ... The script is very poorly written while the music in many parts of the movie does not fits into the scene. Simply, all in all ... unconvincing.

498,magnoliafreak,I should've LOVED this,3,4 July 2021,"And, strangely, I almost certainly did not. Almost. There were several germs of ideas and a couple of well executed scenes, but there was just too much that felt off. Mainly, it felt more like ""Stranger Things"" than ""Fear Steet.""I was born in 1980 and in 1993 I got hooked on Fear Street which led to my obsessions with other YA horror authors of the era, especially Christopher Pike and Lois Duncan. Also, as a little closeted homo it was a safe refuge from the sometimes stressful world of adolescence everyone has to go through. I still have my official Fear Street fan club membership card and my Fear Street calendar too. With all that out of the way I knew ""Fear Street 1994"" would not be based on any previously published book and would be a new story in the spirit of the original Fear Street series. I also knew the new story would be centered on a queer romance and that the violence/adult content would be way more subversive than the original books. So far so good. All this gave me high hopes. So maybe my limited enjoyment of the movie was my own fault for having unrealistic expectations. What didn't I like?1. The needle drops were NOT 1994. I couldn't believe how forced this aspect felt?! The song choices being anachronistic was distracting enough, but the awkwardly shoehorned references to bands of the era in the dialogue was just cringey and forced.2. The dumping ground approach to handing too many subplots was sloppy and ineffective. It felt written on the fly (""Um, okay maybe THIS happens! Ooh, and then some other nonsensical thing happens! Wow, this thing just writes itself!"")and gave the movie some serious pacing issues. So much happening and I couldn't have been less entertained by any of it.3. Heavy handed PCness. My lord, I never thought I'd be the type of person to complain about that sort of thing, but the attempt here to inject a little awareness, a little diversity, a little ""wokeness"" for lack of a less overused term, was handled so horribly!!! I should be LOVING this aspect, but it comes across as so cloying and pronounced that it just made me laugh. It was like when ""Saved by the Bell"" thought they were down with the people because they put Zack in some stereotypical headdress. Also, why crest some new neighboring town called Sunnyvale or dale or whatever. The books already had ""North Hills"" which is where the rich kids lived. Why not just name the rival school after that if you really want to inject an overused Us Vs Them class warfare into a F at Street adaptation. Which brings me to my biggest gripe....
4. Why even call it FEAR STREET?!? There wasn't really anything recognizable for the books fans to enjoy. Basically, there was a popular IP and someone decided to produce their Stranger Things fanfic under that IPs name. That's it.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

507,demonx70,Exceeded Expectations,8,4 July 2021,"To be honest, I didn't have particularly high hopes for this movie. While I wasn't familiar with any of the source material and didn't look at the trailer or anything, it just seemed like it would be very middle of the road. I am not going to say 'BOY WAS I WRONG' rather, I was pleasantly surprised.PROS:
-The actual horror elements are pretty good, it has some explicit gore, a variety of kills, some suspenseful elements and manages to avoid an over reliance on jump scares.-The 90s nostalgia factor works fairly well, albeit overused at times.-The story is intriguing, it drew me in and made me want to know what would happen next.-The actors mostly seem like they could be older teenagers, rather than some obvious 30 year old with a backpack in a highschool looking like that Steve Buscemi meme.CONS
-Some of the characters are a bit cliché or just straight up unlikable at times, although I wouldn't say any of the actors are particularly weak in the roles, more so that the dialogue is occasionally cringe inducing.-As mentioned above, the 90s nostalgia is a bit overdone and nowhere is this more obvious than the soundtrack.OVERALL:
This isn't high art or groundbreaking or revolutionary, but it is a competent, interesting film. The story moves along at a good pace and the kills and violence aren't just one note, they do a variety of things to keep them fresh.As of this writing, this film has almost 300 1 star ratings, and I genuinely cannot fathom why.If you're looking for a fun, violent, 90s nostalgia slasher flick this is well worth spending 1hr 40 minutes on.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

512,xyohannax,Definitely not Fear Street,5,4 July 2021,"I used to read the Fear Street books religiously, that's why I was looking forward to the movies. Sadly, I'm not a fan of the implementation. For me, the Fear Street books were always more enjoyable than the goosebumps series because they had more twists and psychological thriller feel to them and less supernatural aspects. This movie is only trying to belong to the Fear Street saga and mostly makes use of the angsty teen feel and the broad idea of the Fear Street trilogy. With the famous name, it makes you hope for more. Fear Street is about twisted minds and not just plain murder and horror. This movie sadly has none of that and should not belong to the branding.It's not completely bad but it is giving in to quite a few cliches and also fails at achieving the 90s feel. The story had potential especially if they would have actually went with the Fear Street books and not only the Fear Street feeling. It is not unwatchable but the missed opportunities and cliches are very unfortunate and make the movie basic.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

514,daydreammaggs,Okay Okay- Hear me out.,7,15 July 2021,"So, going into this, I had absolutely no idea what I was in store for. Never heard of the books, never watched the trailer. Just saw a new horror title on Netflix and thought I'd give it a go, since it looked to be a series. And I was curious why it would be drawn out into multiple movies like that, in an episodic style.And here's the thing. I think not knowing ANY of the context for the book series going in made the story interesting. I really liked the feuding towns setting. It feels incredibly relevant to even recent news stories of cities being separated into two areas: one full of crime and have-nots, and one full of the rich and the haves. I hope they do more with this, because I think it sets the story up nicely. Even at the end, the killings are blamed on 'druggies'.....which as far as I know, was something that media would most certainly do during the time (and even now).The styling is also really interesting. There is an element of grunge underneath all the bright colors that drew my eye in. Maybe it's not every person's cup of tea, but it felt like a nice blend of raves and a grungey teenagers room.Now for the complaints. Love the kills.....but it totally came out of left field. One moment alive, one moment dead. The first kill in the movie is so good because it's drawn out into a 'will they' or 'won't they' survive....which makes the scene more enthralling. I actually liked the two side characters that died. Was kind of disappointed that they died, but glad that the movie didn't do the 'tragic gays' trope to an extreme level. It's nice to see the gays NOT dead at the end of the movie.Although...... would love some more context to the kills? I wish ....there was a bit more reasoning than 'we disturbed the grave'. Maybe they needed to make the reaction to something so stupid more comedically awful? Maybe kind of like Evil Dead.Anyways. I'm rambling. Do I think this is an amazing horror film? No. But was it good popcorn material? Yes. I think the sheer amount of 1 star votes is ridiculous. The movie was filmed beautifully. The cast did a brilliant job. And at least they are trying to create something original while still appealing to the 'campy' nature of these kinds of horror flicks.Give it a go. Have a drink. And don't overthink this. It's not supposed to win an award. It's supposed to be a fun teen flick people put on at sleepovers.

I read all the Fear Street books growing up and this trash movie is NOT EVEN CLOSE to the great storytelling/character development in the books. The addition of Sunnyvale was completely unnecessary and felt like the rival towns were pandering to Riverdale's audience. This movie also seemed targeted for the Stranger Things fans but completely missed the mark with zero character development and complete lack of suspenseful storytelling. All of the characters in this movie were incredibly unlikeable. The suspenseful tone of the books was completely missing from this movie. Overall it reminded me of the hack job they made out of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. I really wish Netflix would have put this project in Mike Flanagan's hands (Haunting of Hill House) instead of letting Leigh Janiak butcher this.

521,makaylamoss-14481,"It was very entertaining, and interesting!",10,9 July 2021,"Just like the actual fear street books, there are some corny cliches that play out in this horror movie series. We get a lot of suspense and build up, even when nothing scary happens, just to keep you hooked into the story. We get some scary witches curse that isn't much more nuanced than that, you just know it's there and screwing up everything. All of the characters play into a very stereotypical role. Cheerleader acts like a cheerleader. Outcast acts like an outcast. BUT just like the fear-street books, these overplayed stereotypes and common tropes are made bearable and even more so intriguing with the brilliant progression of the story. This movie reminds you that a common trope or cliche is perfectly fine, when it isn't the only thing that carries the story. We get some edge from the characters, even when they still are stereotypical. The cheerleader ends up being much more kinder, and even heroic towards the end. This sudden change wasn't done in a cringey way! Instead the writers and the producers of the show made sure to allow the stereotypical cheerleader to not be so stereotypical while still fitting into that cliche. It's hard to explain but easy to see. The producers and writers made sure to let you watch something that seemingly was familiar but still so interesting. It kind of has the same brilliance of stranger things. Definitely a good watch in the dark with some popcorn.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

I really liked the opening Mall Scene but after that the movie goes downhill and the execution was lackluster... The characters were not explored well as the focus only remains on a few main lead characters and some of them were rather annoying specially the lead character Deena.

If 90's teens were anything, they were definitely music snobs.In the dying days of MTV, discussing Tool, Nine Inch Nails, Nirvana, STP...the list goes on, was a daily thing for the 90's teen. Standing around the lockers and snobbing out, everyone trying to one up each other with their knowledge, made for most of the time before that first morning bell! Don't deny it...you know it's true! HaHa!So the music soundtrack is way off. Some of the songs picked weren't even out in '94 and even if they were, weren't really popular at all until their video made its debut. Leigh Janik, being in high school in '94 should know this.Let us move on to the characters. The movie is filled with common character traits and tropes of the modern day. Aside from the setting, the aggressive playlist inserted everywhere, and some Easter eggs, nothing says ""This is the 90's!"".Speaking of the characters, they are unlikeable. Our ""star"" Deena, is extremely unlikeable. Any where is everyone? Does this town only have like five residents?Let me throw this at you...to others who rode the bus. What bus driver let kids act that way? What bus drive would let the kids open the emergency exit? Does Janik remember the stupid and annoying bus drills we all had to do?! If one even inched towards that door the driver went insane.The movie is plagued by dumb directing like this. The opening led us one way but the rest of the movie just turned into being like every other modern horror just with a heavy coat of nostalgia paint.This doesn't have the feeling of fun 90's nostalgia. It didn't feel like the R. L. Stine books. It didn't feel like Scream. What it did feel like was a bunch of older executives dictating their version of the 90's with a director from that period just shaking her head and agreeing. It was really, really bad.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The actual story itself isn't bad, but the execution was terrible. The movie is full of plot holes. All the characters were unlikeable. There wasn't anyone I was rooting for. I was so glad when the annoying male friend died(he was sooo annoying). The main character didn't care about anyone but her gf, who she was initially mad at and broke up with for moving away (wtf??). Then the plot itself about the killers going after the girl only literally changes. The ending makes no sense. I really hated it.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

First the positives - There were some really cools songs in the soundtrack including Radiohead- Creep and Bush - Machinehead. Maya Hawke was great even in the short screen time she had. Benjamin Flores and the supporting cast did a good job. However, the plot was weak and the writing was poor even for a teen slasher movie. Kiana Madeira's acting was stale at best.

538,redzonia,This movie is annoying,4,12 July 2021,"I see I'm not the only one annoyed by all the inconsistencies in this movie. The initial over use of music that wasn't even released until after this movie takes place is the first thing that bothers me. Only music isn't enough to set the tone of a specific era. Maya Hawks' character has clothes that were typical for the first part of the 90s and sure ""My so called life"" is also mentioned, but that's to little to really get the feel of the 90s. Internet was slow, even in chat rooms. The font annoys me aswell. Typical font of the 90s was Times New Roman (why I still really don't like it). Most of the clothing, hair, make up and even props are off. And the storyline? Oh wow, it's so inconsistent and strange. Scream (that's supposedly one inspiration) had a red thread throughout the whole movie. This is so patchy and odd. People are killed and no one even mentions them. Nobody noticed people screaming and running at the hospital? Also, it kind of feels like so much was revealed about the events leading up to this, I'm not really interested in seeing the other movies. Especially if they are as badly done as this one regarding to facts.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

After Stranger Things setting the bar where it belongs you can't have half hearted mishaps like this.Disjointed script, characters you just can't feel for and non flowing pacing.One star for the selection of good songs which also turned against itself pretty quickly.I got halfway through and had to give up.

I really enjoyed my time in Fear Street and am looking forward to parts 2 & 3.As for the ""reviewers"" complaining about ""woke culture"" because the lead characters are gay......YAAAAAAAWN.

543,flib1,"Too violent for YAs, too boring for adults.",3,3 July 2021,"I'll try and keep this short. As far as I'm aware, this is supposed to be adapted from a young adult series of RL Stine books but I'm not sure this is really suitable for younger teenagers.Adults will likely find it way too boring and derivative for it to be interesting.It tries to cram in popular nineties songs in a vain attempt to invoke feelings of nostalgia but all it seemed to do was to make me ponder how they'd managed to get the rights for a decent song for something so dreadful.Maybe that's where all the budget went.My other point is that plenty of the reviewers here are blathering on about it being ""woke"" (maybe they think lesbians didn't exist in the 1990's?) but if anything it makes you cringe at how badly this genre has aged.Watching a realistic depiction of a man overpowering a screaming woman, who's then stabbed to death, just seems to feel deeply uncomfortable now.Maybe movies like Scream were different because they were satirising the slasher movie, but then again maybe if I watched them now, they'd feel equally as exploitative to me.Whilst I guess this film is supposed to be a homage to such films, it's just not clever enough to pull it off.So it ends up just being scenes of graphic violence with nothing to counterbalance it.At least I won't have to watch the rest of the installments.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
544,Xieger,Might as well be a B movie,3,13 July 2021,"The original Fear Street series by RL Stine were no masterpieces by any means, but it was a still good enough as a guilty pleasure read during my pre-teen years when I eagerly grabbed each new book off the library shelves.Fast forward nearly 30 years later and I saw that part of my childhood is finally made into ""moving pictures""! So... hurray? Nay!Besides the filming style and special effects, this movie was as good as watching a spinning ceiling fan.The characters, boring. The scares, nearly non-existent. The kills, predictable.This movie cared more about breaking social norms message than adhering to the horror genre. The monsters were treated as bad garnish. They were developed so poorly, I couldn't be more apathetic about any of the monsters or the kids.If Stranger Things did nostalgia right, Fear Street did it wayyy wrong.Their laughable idea of nostalgia is to play 15 second clips of hit 90s songs in a non-stop cycle like good o'l America's top 40 by Casey Kasem.The kids didn't act like or look like they knew anything of the 90s. They may as well have been Marty McFlys from the 2020s that were accidentally sent back in time.Like I said, poor acting, poor directing, and a boring ""horror"" movie.

I can't blame the actors on their performance cause the movie lacks so much substance that I don't know if they're failing to deliver for this reason. The plot is a whole mess and you barely connect with any character.Like everyone else said, the 90s depiction isn't accurate. Nothing feels or looks like this era.

I usually give a movie the benefit of the doubt, but after the intro scene I could tell this was not my type of movie: juvenile, corny, and a tonal disaster. Like others have stated, it completely wastes its '90s setting, save for the endless barrage of pop songs it shoves down your throat in the first ten minutes. If this was supposed to be a love letter to the '90s slasher is genre, I suppose it succeeds as movies like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer kinda sucked to begin with. Repeating stupid tropes, even when acknowledging they're stupid tropes, never pays off. This also boasts one of the worst screenplays I've seen in a while, with phony high school dialog so cringy that the actors on Dawson's Creek would be afraid to utter it.

Something about this really got me excited! It is based on the Fear Street series but the movie is very grown up and modern compared to where the books were.Horror fans may not be the ideal viewer for this series!

551,juicebox07,Scream Ripoff?,7,6 July 2021,"A lot of reviewers are calling this movie a Scream ripoff. Since when was Scream about a witch that cursed a town? That's what this movie is actually about. The killers are just supernatural henchmen doing the witch's bidding. The only part similar to Scream was the opening scene, which makes sense since it was an homage to Scream. Clearly that is a word that is not in some peoples vocabulary. The killer with the sack on his head is also a nod to Friday the 13th (part 2).With that said, this movie does have its faults. It feels like a modern day movie pretending to be 90's. I love 90's music, but cramming a different song into a scene every five seconds doesn't make it more authentic. I also find it hard to root for the protagonists when none of them really come across as likable.Even so, I still found this movie entertaining, and I'm looking forward to parts 2 and 3.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

Benjamin Flores Jr does a great job conveying the lore to the audience and provides a convincing performance. Julia Rehwald and Fred Hechinger, respectively, provide amazing performances and great comedic relief. The movie contains tons of twists, and overall is so well done.

The movie seemed to forget that just adding nineties stuff doesn't make it good. None of the characters were particularly likeable...by the end I was actively rooting for them to just die so it would be over. And no one in this movie acts like a real person. ""Wow the girl I had a crush on was just murdered right in front of me, no big deal imma just order some pizza, chat with my friend online and call it a night aha""....""dang my boyfriend and two of my friends were murdered tonight, better go make out with my ex and listen to this sick mixed tape"". Also, their whole plan was to restart Samantha's heart, and instead of using a defibrillator (you know, like the one in the ambulance they had already stolen) they thought it was a better idea to make her OD and hope for the best?I could go on and on.

582,nicolaelln-55775,BAD,1,8 July 2021,Not nostalgic.... Doesn't take me back. What's with the random music and tunes? At inappropriate times. Characters annoying and young. If you like riverdale watch it. If you're a 90's loving horror fanatic you'll hate it.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
583,ruslanluthier,I'm just glad that they finally made it,10,13 July 2021,"I appreciate the attempt and happy that you guys finally made the movie after goosebumps.

584,bensbushido,Hopefully the worst film i'll see this decade.,2,24 July 2021,"Had potential to be fun, silly, tense slasher. Unfortunately it was just silly. It was set in 1994 for absolutely no reason other than novelty. The characters were almost entirely unlikeable and more crucially unbelievable. People the characters are supposed to be good friends with are brutally attacked and murdered and they don't even bat an eyelid? They act completely irrationally - SPOILERS - when they decide Sam needs to die and there method of death is the most convoluted they could imagine (take these pills then these other pills and wait an hour whilst we aimlessly stroll around a poorly lit supermarket, with thousands of blind corners smeared with your blood? Like what?? This cannot be the same 5 people who trapped and incinerated the same baddies an hour ago. Also just drive around and wait for her to OD if thats the plan! So so bad.) Just criminally bad character's and story. All this absurdity just rips you out of the film and any tension the film tries to build (poorly at that) is null and void. The only reason its not a 1 is because the practical effects crew did a decent job. Please don't bother watching this it's not even bad in a good way, its just bad. Netflix do better.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

586,BillyJessup,To Debunk The Overly-Dramatic...,7,3 July 2021,"I inhaled every RL Stine book back when. Owned all the original Goosebumps. The Fear Street books I didn't own I got out of the library (I for some reason remember a book about a killer snowman so vividly).A - 'the characters don't bring 1990's vibes'...what does that even mean? Are they supposed to say 'cool beans?' Reference The Smashing Pumpkins? Everyone who says this has no context behind it...just this weird, vague statement. If someone told me that I wasn't acting like I was 'in 2021', I wouldn't even know what that meant. I need a tiktok account I guess?B - yes, Firestarter is from 1996. Most movies or shows have songs from that era or year but don't rely exclusively on them...so I think a bad precedent was set by having the first 4-5 songs from 1994 and everyone expected that to continue.C - 'woke' nonsense...cut us a break. Whether the main characters are two girls or not, how does this matter? Zero relevance, just some homophobic nitpicking. Nothing about it being two girls, or a girl and a guy, (or two guys) changed the plot at all.D - but everyone hates Sam...why did they all protect her??? No. Wrong. No one hated Sam except one character because they broke up, and - in fact - at least one or more of the other characters said to knock it off and stop being a baby. So, no. Incorrect again. She was simply involved in the plan because of who she was and what she had realized. Another ridiculous gripe that doesn't make any sense.For those debating on whether to watch it, do not listen to these weird reviews which are nitpicking things that are completely immaterial to the storyline and overall plot. It's like saying I hated Halloween because Michael's attire was grey and not black. Get a life. Typical elitists looking to trash anything that isn't stellar. Probably the same people who think A Ghost Story is a modern classic, that artsy-fartsy POS. They already know it won't meet their criteria, so they are watching and reviewing simply to bash it.

I didn't like the characters, there was too much side drama, and the story just felt uneven.Like the writers couldn't make up their mind if they wanted to create a Euphoria teen drama or a slasher movie.After going on rottentomatoes and seeing 87%, I assumed it was me. But now that I'm here reading reviews, I'm seeing the exact same comments and critiques that I felt so I now know I'm not alone.Just bummed me out.

It's a teen slasher, 90s style, but with a nice paranormal twist.So what's with the hate?I personally thought that despite the heavy-handed soundtrack this film ticked all the right boxes for me when it comes to watching a film of this nature. I knew I wasn't watching ""The Witch"" or ""Halloween"", so had a low expectation that I'm pleasantly surprised to say was greatly exceeded.The film had the usual jump scares and quirky/witty dialog you expect from a 90s slasher, but with the addition of a paranormal backstory which is a nice touch usually absent from this genre.Not to mention one death scene in particular that was delightfully gruesome and a refreshingly new method of killing.Ignore the 1s, take the film with a pinch of salt and enjoy it for what it is: popcorn slasher fun with a bit of supernatural mystery thrown in for good measure.(After the awful sequels, I've brought this down as when seen as a standalone it's pretty fun but the whole thing is a hot mess)",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

It's absurd to see a 6.5 average rating for a movie that claims to be a horror movie but lands so far outside of the true horror realm. This movie feels more like some kind of hybrid Scream plus anti-superhero mash-up. Nobody acts afraid in this movie and everybody jokes about death from the onset. You have a group of teenagers taking on Sandman, Harlequin, and Skeletor. It's a high quality production, so watch it if you're bored, but don't expect to see a horror movie, this is not a horror movie.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

To see it come to life at a rating for its now adult fans got me even more excited. I am going to have to dig out my books and reread them. I love the fact that they put the books in the first 5 minutes of the movie. Was fun to see. The music show is a frickin blast to listen to. Insert all it is a serious nostalgic fun pack.

They didn't have her blood on them but got killed of anyway.Sams boyfriend didn't have her blood on him but got killed of.It was quiet inconsistent in the end and that kinda bothered me because it was such a major flaw.I know that horror movies rarely make sense at all but the writing could have been better.Still entertaining enough for a one time watch though.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994

However, that being said, the writers/directors definitely took away from the major storyline by trying to make it about LGBTQ. Yes, I am all for incorporating equality, but honestly this movie just fell short because they made it pretty sexual near the end and clearly fixated on that aspect.

615,clink-97044,Interesting Premise,3,16 July 2021,"Unfortunately that's all I can really say positive. Because of that I wanted to like the movie. It's kind of like someone who's a fan of Stranger Things said to themselves ""how cool would it be if this took place in the 90s"" then researched a bunch of songs that came out a specific year. Other than lack of cell phones this movie might as well have taken place today.There's not much to like really. Certainly not the dialogue, which I feel was written by someone who just kind of assumes how teenagers talk, but never actually talked to one (or a human being for that matter). If this was written by an 11 year old, I guess that's acceptable. That's pretty much what it boils down to. It's an R Rated movie that looks to appeal to adolescents, which makes about as much sense as the characters themselves. The younger brother is the only one remotely relatable, as the other characters simply don't exist anywhere else, including the adults. It makes about as much sense as stabbing someone with 8 Epi Pens to resuscitate them after drowning (my fav scene by far).It's a mess. Kind of fun sometimes, but mostly a mess.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

L. Stine work (the original author) and you're looking for thrilling movie like Stranger Things, this is actually the one. If you have read the books you might be (a little) dissapointed because this movie skipped soo many details in order to squeeze it together into 3 movies.I'm going to be really honest here, I almost quit watching for the first 30 minutes for being like budget Stranger Things, but I decided to give it a go since it wasn't so bad, and it actually got better and better on Part 2 and Part 3 sequentially. (mind you, movie sequel tends to sucks and doesn't live up the hype, but Fear Street delivers)Part 2 and Part 3 were so good; that I recommend you to go all in or none at all. Soo if you haven't read the books and you're considering watching this, give it a shot.

You could have told me it was set in 2021. The characters were almost entirely unlikeable apart from one or two and why was the main character so unnecessarily aggressive to EVERYONE? The characters lacked motivation, didn't react at all to situations going on around them (your boyfriend was just stabbed to death in front of you, but sure - never mention this again and get back with your ex.) the plot was riddled with holes and the settings were unrealistic. (Only two people working in a hospital? Unattended ambulance with keys in the ignition? Find skeletal remains in the woods and don't bat an eyelid while you handle rotting flesh and bones? OK sure.)

620,alejrokalsinghatem,A fun and surprising tribute to horror classics.,7,4 July 2021,"Fear Street brought several classics back to life, such as Scream and Friday the 13th, in a way to pay homage to them in a film that, if taken lightly and without any expectations, manages to amuse and entertain the viewer.Despite its mistakes, like several clichés (worthy of a Slasher movie) and attitudes that are unrealistic and even shameful in face of what was going on, Fear Street delivers a reasonable horror movie, with good performances and punctual direction, which brings a certain surprise inside what is expected of a Slasher movie. The deaths are extremely violent and some of them are surprising, taking away the predictable character of the film at certain moments and leaving the viewer more interested in the story they are following.Fear Street - Part 1: 1994, is a request for a fan of the Slasher genre and positively surprises, does his homework succinctly and awakens interest in the continuation, but he still presents several mistakes, which make him be an average film, with good hits, but with notable and punctual mistakes.Fear Street - Part 1: 1994

I'm surprised Steve Buscemi didn't get cast as him. I'm aware that a lot of movies do this, but these guys are clearly not high school students. Watching adults acting as kids, acting as adults. There's more (plot) holes in this movie than a block of Swiss cheese. The constant neon lighting is frustrating. It's like watching a movie, set in a nightclub the whole time. I was rooting for them all to be killed, with the exception of maybe one. Also, constantly filling scenes with cool 90's music doesn't make the movie any cooler. It's forced.

Really? After 400 years? Also, you are being chased by crazy killers and you're making out in a classroom and talking about your feelings?

The cast was picked out so perfectly and I'm glad the director chose rising stars as well. The plot was great and the plot twist was even better.The first movie was actually a little confusing but I think that's what was suppose to happen. After watching the second the first starts to make more sense and you start to get obsessed. The third one is honestly just perfect. The first half I honestly kinda hated because of how sad it was and how things ended but the second half made up for the sadness.I would personally say that Part 2 was my favorite out of all because it was so detailed and just overall intriguing. I felt so attached to the characters and I really felt their emotions.It's funny because Olivia (plays Sam) posted a spoiler and people were going crazy in the comments and I ended up figuring out what it meant BUT i had to finish the series to fully understand how the plot twist happened.I overall have recommended this to my friends and family and I can't wait for their feedback.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994

All the dialogue was cringeworthy. All the bad guys were copied from better movies.I was rolling my eyes so hard, I think I saw my brain for second. And the movie drags. They're trying to sell the relationship between the two main characters, but no one is buying. There is no relationship, other then what they tell you. What you see is the two of them fighting and hating each other. And out of nowhere, they're a couple again, and their love is forever and can't be stopped. Not buying it. Which is fine, if they didn't stop the movie several times to give you more insight in to this love story no one cares about.Bottom line: it's nothing original, and unless someone is dying on the screen, it's boring and super cringey.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

Based on the title alone we already know this. But the soundtrack is SUPER heavy handed (I joked with my SO that I was just waiting for Creep to play and Boom! There it is), wardrobe feels like what a gen z-er thinks ppl
In the 90s looked like ( sooo many sun dresses with long sleeve shirts) and the script made sure in 90s slang like Whack which as a teenager in 1994 I don't know anyone that actually used it.

The deaths were satisfying enough, but I don't think some characters should've been killed off just yet; even though, those deaths were still very heartbreaking. There are still some things that I didn't like about the movie though, such as the main character feeling like the most generic part of the film and that the deaths in the film didn't feel like they had much of an effect on the main characters. The soundtrack to the movie was mediocre at best and some of the random kills didn't make much sense to me. I have read some of the Fear Street books and I would say that this movie is a very loose adaptation, but I did enjoy a good amount of it. Overall, the film is enjoyable and I would recommend it.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

648,ShesGotATicketToRide,Background Noise To Listen To While Doing Your Laundry,4,8 July 2021,"It's easy to criticize the worst of this movie.At its worst, the characters aren't memorable or likable, there are plenty of plot holes, and they fall so short when trying to get it seem like it takes place in the 1990s.It's hard to root for main character Deena when she's aggressive and constantly yelling. Deena seemed not to have the right personality for main character. Viewers often like characters who are relatable, who have a backbone, who grow throughout the film, but none of these traits are represented in her. Her character didn't seem to have much depth other than being annoyed.Even as a person who enjoys 90s music, the soundtrack seemed forceful. It was almost as if they were playing songs back to back to just remind you that it took place in 1994. There were good songs that played, but they weren't used just right. I think we all wanted an epic ending scene with the teens vs. The villains with a 90s pop song playing in the background as they fight to the death. Dreamers we must be.The best of it was the beginning scene, which unfortunately set up the expectations for the movie too high. Also can't complain about how overall the movie looked well made.They tried hard for this movie to be like of one the greats, yet they missed the mark. Personally I don't think I'll be watching it again any time soon, but it's a neutral pick for background noise while doing your laundry or something because it's not that interesting but at least it's there.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
649,danielbadasci,Started good.,1,12 July 2021,Wow! That beginning was amazing. The setting the neon color glow in the dark so creative. I thought I was in for a real treat. The female that is killed at the beginning was a mistake. She was very final girl material. Towards the middle the film picked up and looked promising. A lot of jump scares and slow dialogue and stretched out scenes. I couldn't get in to any of the characters to root for them to live or die. It was a waste of time even for watching it for free. Awful and disappointing as I'm a 90's Baby and grew up reading Fear Street books. I may not be aware of all books and characters but I am still not happy about this film. Another stretched out long boring film. My opinion skip this one it is bad enough that their are already two more being made. They should of moved along and did all new casting for each new sequels. I see a lot are reprising roles for the sequel already.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994

651,gameplaycom,What is Fear Street Part 1 Truly,5,15 July 2021,"Fear Street where to begin overall the 1st adaption of the series is not terrible, but not terrific. The overall plot is a good idea to have, with a 90s slasher but didn't give that slasher vibe. The teens in the movie look like they were straight of out 2021. If the characters had 90s hairstyles with some nostalgia 90s clothes, I believe people would have liked it better. One issue the first part had was the amount of music used, I'm not trashing on 90s music I'm just saying there should have been less. It feels like every other minute there was music playing. The character was an upside, besides Deena. If her lines were writing better it would have people liked her more, she comes off too aggressive, and is hard to like her as the main character. Another thing that made no sense is it feels like all of the teens live in some remote town in Alaska. There are barely any background people for example at the hospital and the town. I get it that it's supposed to be focused on Denna and her friends, but there was defiantly room for improvement. After watching The first part of fear street there was some work that was needed, but overall was an average film, which hopefully leads to better.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
652,gabriellegrosbety5,Deadly universe with thrills unparalleled,9,17 July 2021,"Fear Street Part One: 1994, based on the R. L. Stine novels and released as a trilogy on Netflix, gets off to an immersive, action-packed start with a girl who works at a bookstore getting the shock of her life when she becomes the real-life target of an attack that might usually only happen in the books she sells. There is officially a ruthless killer on the loose, but what lies behind this particular killer is a far more venomous history spanning centuries. Gruesome violence and bloodshed itself, however, is not new to Shadyside, the town in question where this narrative takes place, jarring the senses as strongly as if on a rising thrill ride. Each feeling is heightened and vividly felt as the landscape, dark, gritty, and foreboding, passes by, reminding each character of the suffocating feeling of their own relentless entrapment. They feel doomed to repeat a tragic cycle of history and never make it anywhere or be anything, but little do many of the residents know that the town has long been cursed and there is a reason for the zinging onslaught of antics, reckless violence, and heart-shattering tragedy past just being struck with a hand of bad luck.As the tale continues, we find ourselves in the town over called Sunnyvale and on the surface it is everything Shadyside is not: luxurious, relatively-crime free, and filled with the warmness of a supple sunlight that shields all of its residents from the perceived danger of Shadyside. However, there is a bitter rivalry between the two towns that continues to persist as Shadyside is viewed as defiant and inferior to the tamer and more welcoming Sunnyvale. Danger and resentment, though, imminently lurks beneath the pretty, glamorous exterior that Sunnyvale pretends, threatening to spill over any second with a building velocity and disruptive volatility.It becomes up to Deena (Kiana Madiera) and her friends, who live in Shadyside, as well as her former flame and new Sunnyvaler/former Shadysider, creating stirring animosity between the two, Samantha (Olivia Scott Welch) to try to save their town from crumbling into the darkness of its own rubble. Though, they soon learn that it is not that simple and dates back to previous carnage, which will take longer than anticipated to understand and be able to make sense of. Their journey, however, is filled with a lot of heart and rediscovery of what it means to love and develop a deeper kinship through traumatic times or shared circumstances that can never be forgotten. It is filled with a rush of excitement, ambient nostalgia for times past in the 90s with the most appropriate soundtrack and build-up of atmosphere, and a tender look, amidst all the gore, at what lengths we will go to in order to fight for what's right, even if what's right is not immediate to reveal itself, but will as we journey through all the unfathomable enigmas that plague our individual and collective sense of reason.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The movie goes very graphic with some deaths, which if that excites you, there's that. The movie universe is interesting which is what makes it at least worth the watch.

654,mshrew-43695,Take a chance on this,8,19 July 2021,"After watching all 3 episodes my overall take was that I liked it and I judge that on if I have wasted hours of my life that I can't get back. I think those hours were worth it, sort of. Fear Street one, 1994: it took several tries to get through this. I found it cheesy and a Stranger Things/Stephen King knock off (or was Stranger Things a Fear Street knock off? Hmm?) but I did finally get through it hoping it would get better and it did because I kept going with two. Part two, 1978: just my era. Teenage camp, getting in trouble, looking for boys to get in trouble with etc with but now I felt this episode was Friday the 13th meets Jack Torrance meets Stranger Things. But I started to get into it a bit more so I kept going. Sorry, the music draws me in! But I found 1978 to have a bit of a deeper story line and character depth. Part three, 1666: I love old timey stuff and witchcraft and witch hunts so I was much more drawn to this episode but satan-y stuff is not really my thing but I was already deeply invested. The series does continue to channel Stranger Things so I found it hard to separate the two and The Shining score in the background at times was too much to handle. But I did enjoy this episode. Did I love it 100%? No way. Maybe in the 80-85% range. Maybe because I worked in a mall in the 80's and felt all the love that the mall offers after it is closed. But overall if you have some hours to kill I would recommend this as decent entertainment and with very little precious time to spare in the realm of hours of life, I don't feel like those hours were ultimately wasted.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

661,osufbf,Picking on the soundtrack,1,8 August 2021,"A common theme I've seen from most reviewers of this film is the ""authenticity"" of the soundtrack and how it's virtually the only thing nostalgic about it. For me, that's patently false.Overall, the soundtrack was very disappointing. Even some songs that appear that kind of make sense as to why they're in the movie, it just seems like director Leigh Janiak threw them in as a way to say, ""and here's another song from the time period that was popular"" rather than trying to play something that captured the mood of the scene.As a 16/17-year-old kid who remembers 1994 like it was yesterday, music was a huge part of my adolescent years, like it is for any teenager growing up. And if the soundtrack is the aspect of this movie that a lot of folks here are hanging their hat on, then they either didn't grow up in the '90's or just didn't listen to a lot of mainstream radio.I'm going to assume that this flick is supposed to take place in the fall of '94 given that football players and cheerleaders are the focal point at the beginning. Granted, I wouldn't doubt if it actually takes place in the spring and Janiak added the football aspect because football players and cheerleaders are typically the most popular sects of kids in virtually every high school across the country and having them as your ""main"" character types (aside from THE lead character being in the band) would be a cool thing to have in the movie.But I momentarily digress, back to the soundtrack.Garbage's ""Only Happy When It Rains"" (1995), White Zombie's ""More Human Than Human"" (1995), Prodigy's ""Firestarter"" (1996) and White Town's ""Your Woman"" (1997) hadn't been released yet.Pixies' ""Hey"" (1987) and Cowboy Junkies' remake of ""Sweet Jane"" (1988) certainly didn't receive any airplay in '94 to warrant being considered a song that speaks to the year. And if they did get some airtime, it was VERY few and far between and were definitely not songs I can recall hearing on the radio or seeing on TV.Roberta Flack's 1973 version of ""Killing Me Softly With His Song""? That was definitely not heard on the radio in 1994 and only got re-recognized when the Fugees did their take on it in '96.""Thursday"" by 99 Tales?? Even though it's a cool, grungy tune and sounds like something that would've been popular back then, to this day I've never even heard of this song nor this band and couldn't find anything on them despite an extensive Google search.There were a couple of songs that Janiak kind of got right like Cypress Hill's ""Insane In The Brain"", Snoop's ""G'z and Hustlas"", Radiohead's ""Creep"" and even Sophie B. Hawkins' ""Damn, I Wish I Was Your Lover"".Even though the latter two came out in '92 and the former two came out in '93, you could still watch the videos on The Box or hear someone bumping them from their car stereo. (Except Hawkins. I don't remember hearing anyone loudly pump her jams while cruising through town.)Portishead's ""Sour Times"" was mildly popular at the time and was released in August of that year so I'm willing to give Janiak a pass on it. Even though it's definitely not a song I vividly recall being a major staple of 1994.And then there is Soundgarden's ""The Day I Tried To Live"". Indeed, they were a band that was ALL OVER the radio at that time. When they came out with Superunknown, there wasn't an hour that went by that you didn't hear ""Spoonman"", ""Black Hole Sun"" or ""Fell On Black Days"" being cranked out. But ""The Day I Tried To Live""? Even though it was a single released from the album, it's probably the lowest-ranking single released. I get that Janiak was simply trying to capture the mood of the scene (one of the few times she does in the movie) but it's still not the song I'd pick for being the ONLY grunge song in the movie as well as one from SG. Don't get me wrong, it's a great song and one I incorporate with that time period but if you're going to use a Soundgarden song, pick one of the aforementioned three rather than this one. Those other three ring truer to me for 1994 than that one. I know, I know, now I'm just being nit-picky.The ONE song, however, that Janiak ABSOLUTELY nailed on the head and one that was an insane smash hit was Nine Inch Nails' ""Closer"". As soon as I heard it in the very beginning of the movie, it immediately took me back to the beginning of my senior year and going to a party where that was being played. That song definitely speaks to 1994.Aside from Soundgarden, though, where was the rest of the grunge?? It was the style that dominated the airwaves, music charts and MTV at the time. Although it wasn't the ONLY musical style out there (rap was really picking up steam and even country was highly dominant with the likes of Garth Brooks, Tim McGraw, Faith Hill and Alan Jackson) but grunge was still the most popular music at the time. Where was the Nirvana, Pearl Jam, STP, Alice In Chains and Green Day?? If you're going to make a movie about 1994, you've got to play a vast majority of grunge, not the jumbled mess Janiak incorporated.And the soundtrack wasn't the only reason why I gave this movie 1 star but was certainly a huge catalyst for me. The overall vibe of this being in 1994 just isn't there. AOL was a thing but if folks who actually grew up in the dial-up age can remember, incoming calls would kick offline whomever was on because your internet was plugged into the phone jack in the wall. So the scene where little bro is on the cpu and big sis receives a call and he continues to type is an inconsistency.And the part where little bro is talking about people trading ""life hacks online"" was NEVER a thing back then. In fact, I don't remember calling it being ""online"" until several years after '94. At that point, it was being on the ""Information Super Highway"" or the ""World Wide Web"".Seeing as how Janiak was born in 1980, she would've primarily been 14 at the time so I'm sure she can remember this year fairly well. Which is surprising as to how badly she missed the mark.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

676,valentin-i-323-701967,It's nice entertainment,6,11 July 2021,"I did not go in this movie expecting a masterpiece. I read several books of the fear street series and I've never thought that those were masterpieces, but it was nice entertainment. It felt like I was grown up when I read it with the violence and horror/thriller elements.The same was delivered for me in this movie. I also like the attempt at some social subtext in the movie. Does not mean it's super deep. I like some bitter characters sometime, it can suck to be a teen. Also the acting I thought was quite good epecially for a horror movie.I also like that the second installment also builds on this movie. I think it's fun. I'm not a hardcore slasher fan and I appreciated that the movie was not simply gore only. So I also did not mind some teen drama mixed in there.SPOILERS:I did appreciate that they did not quickly kill off the only character who has dark skin or that they just kill off everybody who makes some sexual experiences. I'm not catholic that way. I liked the diversity in the movie and it did not feel that pushed in like in some other netflix shows. I liked how it was not predictable how the characters got killed and see it as a strength not a weakness. People tend to get way to obsessed with certain characters. I think the story as a whole has take center stage and I think the deaths served the story well. How the details inform us that they're not simply deadbeat children. They have layers, even though it does not have a lot of build up you can see the groundwork for more complicated characters and people who just want to see them as annoying, it's all they'll ever see. It's hard to get over prejudice, so it's more comfortable to feed people back what they have said about you over and over again, then to be honest and get the trust abused again.The music is too much especially in the beginning of the movie. It would have been better to let it breathe a bit even though the music was good, just the frequency of nods to those hits was too high and lost its effectiveness.So if you are not set in your ways too much when it comes to horror and what it's supposed to be, which stereotypes a horror movie has to follow and appreciate the mix of ghost, slasher and teen drama then it can be for you, if you're looking for a pure slasher horror, then this is not for you. Also if you do not like female directors this is not for you and if you judge a character depending on the first sentences they speak, it's not for you.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

Anyone on here complaining that the movie is too ""woke"" have not evolved with the times. Want old school misogynistic horror, watch old movies, they aren't going any where. They are classics for a reason and I would never discredit them because they have paved the way for horror but the genre has grown exponentially since then.

I was the same age as these kids in 1994 and NOTHING about this movie reminds me of the 90's, aside from the music of course. Early on I picked up on the cheesy ""Scream"" vibe, but this is way cheesier and very unbelievable. These kids do not act like we did in the 90s. Not saying kids were angels back then but they didn't act like these whiny, annoying, foul-mouthed teenagers. I was hoping for something similar to Stranger Things, but no such luck.Also, what age group is this movie targeting? Initially I thought this movie was aimed at young adults since the RL Stine books were really popular among that age group in the 90s. Plus with all the young actors, I figured it be a PG-13 movie.

The two main characters which are the exs in the movie you wish they die at the end. They are so annoying... no one tunes in to a horror flick to see the exaggerated teenage girl drama. The killer babysitter movie did so much better with that. In this one, the ones that die are the ones that you might want to live.

It's not a 10 movie, but let's be honest, what slasher movie is. I really enjoyed this movie. The plot isn't original, but it's 2021; nothing is original. If you want to watch a bunch of teens taking on a evil dead witch who has cursed a town sending out her henchmen do to her bidding then you came to the right place. Plenty of gore, good enough story, and good acting.

694,morningview_ok,The only thing 90s about this film is the clothes.,5,6 July 2021,"So, this film is cut like a trailer that happens to run for 140mins. The actors do well and the shots aren't janky, but that's it. There are just so many cuts, whoever was editing this film chopped each shot like he's cutting onions so much so his kids can't taste it.The film is (obviously) set in the 90s but the only thing 90s about this film is costume choice. There's no indication by dialogue, no cultural representation. And there are songs from '94 but I feel like they're too deeply cut to be consciously relevant, not setting the tone properly. Not to mention suffering hugely from Suicide Squad Syndrome, where you basically just play 15songs in 15mins. I really hope this isn't a trend for modern film, it's lazy af. Fortunately, this only happens in the first 15mins post-opening credits.The pros are the main relationship run-line (mostly for representation in today's society, I don't think this would fly in '94) which I appreciate, the actors do well enough, and the shot choices are mediocre, which, in this film, is definitely considered a plus. And the skull mask is definitely one of the better I've seen, a mix of cool-looking while it knowing that it is meant to be a Halloween costume.Overall, it's definitely a similar attempt like 'Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark', that weird space between late teen Nickelodeon to young adult that is probably too gory for the Nick-teen half.

All spoilers aside, I found the movie potent, I much preferred it to R. L Stines other debut adult horror film 'scary stories'. The music/score on on top of the overall plot reminded me of being introduced to the 'goosebumps' series. (Nostalgic) perfect for a horror movie night. It never ran slow, although the romance seemed farfetch, the casting was well done, was shot well, and was immersed unlike (other netflix originals) especially Benjiman Floris's performance, he gave a good laugh with his nerdy ness and was overall the most entertaining and believable character. If you're looking for a slasher series that isn't horrible, give it a shot! I'll certainly be watching part 2 on June 9th!! Definitely a good introduction film to slashers with your son... Only issue, really that was the ""90s""?!! It seemed forced and far fetched, the clothing was lack, it made me cringe watching her listen to creep through a walkman.

Really couldn't care if they survived or not. It does not capture the 90s well at all - just show an old PC, landline telephone and throw in some 90s music with terrible timing and that's as 90s as it gets.

I'm a huge horror movie fan, I graduated high school in '97, and I read all the Fear Street books to the point of obsession.This is a perfect campy horror movie for slasher fans. It's super bloody and gory, it's totally unbelievable, the soundtrack is rad, the plot has holes and the acting is decent enough.The one star reviews are completely out of line which is why I'm giving it 10 stars. Is this a 10 star, Oscar worthy, mind blowing slasher flick? OF COURSE NOT. If you're expecting that going in then you are not a genre fan or you would know better.The director and writers included elements of previous killer movies because it's an homage to the 90s. Not doing so would have been a mistake. Those of you complaining about the fact that the adults are absent or the music was inaccurate or the clothing was ""too 90s""...y'all don't get what the movie actually is which is a straight up B Horror flick, that I would have happily paid 3$ to see the Friday night 10pm showing at the single screen theater in my small home town.

This is definitely a scream.type horror slasher film reminiscent of the 90s but the poor reviews on this are simply trying to put this movie on a playing field with other horror gems like Friday the 13th, Scream or Nightmare on Elm Street. The fact of the matter, this movie, as a part one, offers a great start to a seemingly good story thus far. The movie was entertaining, provided good substance, good acting, and even some genuine suspense. It's not going to be this year's best horror film but I assure you it's well worth the watch with the lights down low and you going into it wanting to have some fun. I was entertained throughout and I'm very excited for part two and where this story goes from here. This is an RL Stine story, if you're a fan off Goosebumps, you know exactly how well Stine mixes cheesy ""children's"" stories with some real authentic fright.

714,emillirons,For the fans of the books!,10,21 July 2021,"I was shocked to see so many negative reviews after I watched this last night, but after reading through the reasons I realized these people probably didn't read/love the books. I was obsessed with the books growing up (to the point where my parents were concerned and made me read a Babysitter's Club book for every Fear Street book lol). I'm going to address the recurring complaints I saw in other reviews.1. Unlikable/overly aggressive characters- that's on purpose. Shadyside brings out the worst in people. It's not good guys vs. Bad guys. It's the townspeople trying to overcome the evil forces affecting them as individuals and the town in general. They explained this in the beginning.2. Not 90's enough- Some of the music came out after 1994. Ok, so? It's a trivial thing to be mad about when the music was about the vibe. I admit they got a little carried away with the frequency of introducing new songs for every scene early on. They could have cut a few and it would have flowed better. Some people didn't think the clothes, settings, mannerisms were 90's and I just don't get why because I grew up in the 90's and this brought back so many memories. The mall. Calling someone a dill weed. That interaction between Deena and her brother to get off the lame AOL chat room happened with my sister and I daily.3. Plot holes and unrealistic situations/reactions- you mean just like the books? The books were cheesy! Full of corny tropes and over-the-top dialogue and one-liners. That's the point!4. Horror buffs saying this didn't play out like the 90's horror films- there were a few nods but it wasn't trying to be like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. It was trying to be like the books.In conclusion, this series is 100% for the fans of the corny teenage books from the 90's. If you loved the books, your inner pre-teen will be left feeling satisfied. If you're looking for some groundbreaking amazing horror movie you will be disappointed.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

I enjoyed the film - but in that not really paying attention because I don't have to, and it's something entertaining to watch kind of way.First things first, this film has a great playlist - and I say playlist because that's what it is - it's no soundtrack. In an era where the majority of music consumption is single focused, skip and forget, I guess it's no surprise that a film based on a teen horror series of books (something that completely passed me by) has a current teen mindset when it comes to music.Which leads me to something else - this is an 18, but is clearly aimed at the mid teen audience in terms of plot and story line. Ok, that's the certification bodies responsibility I guess, but still I found it jarring.The tracks played are accurate in terms of era, but they don't really add anything to the scenes, and they don't gel as a curated list of songs - we found ourselves commenting more on the quality of the tracks, not so much the film. As a result, I'm now listening to the playlist on a well known music streaming service whilst working. It's like someone actually used a well known internet search and typed '90s music' and just picked some at random - with a couple of curve balls thrown in.The film was ok - watchable, but I'm not sure I'm excited enough to watch the rest of the series.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

Dee is a classic Mary She character with no redeemable qualities nothing good about them aggressive and arrogant impetuous and stupid. Yet another film that glorifies drug use and it's side effects, makes the worst characters the good guys. Every character except the little brother is entirely irredeemable and unbearable. It's a sad and labored and ignorant attempt at recreating the Scream series and failing miserably. My least favorite part is the fact that the main character gaslights and manipulats every character in the movie and even worse to her ex girlfriend going as far to divert blame about putting her in the hospital, and then blaming her for her parents divorce acting as though she had something to do with it. Further glorifying the idea of Doom and gloom around and catering the plot to make a completely sociopathic main character the good guy and the right one only makes the movie all the worse.

724,horaceandthespider,A mildly enjoyable old school horror pastiche,6,6 August 2021,"I am somewhat baffled by those who say this is not very 90s.Yes - it's true that besides the (occasionally
anachronous) music it doesn't ramp up the 90s clichés in the way Stranger Things does for the 80s... but it does pay huge and seemingly deliberate homage to the 90s slasher films - most obviously the Scream films (that much should clear from the opening scene) without going too far into the realm of parody. Looking at the trailer for part 2 I'm immediately expecting the same to be repeated there for the original Friday the 13th film and similar.For someone who went through their teenage years in the 90s enjoying those films, but has found horror/slasher films of recent years too grotesque purely for shock value, this was a refreshing turn to have just enough to wince at, without feeling it was being gratuitous.The acting is generally reasonable, and the characters typical of the genre for the 90s equivalents. It is - of course - reasonable to be able to play the game of guess who will survive, and you could probably form some sort of devastating drinking game out of some of the deliberate character tropes used.I thought the plot and backstory again, not too convoluted and honestly probably better than some of the films to which it pays homage (eg the ""What you did Last Summer"" films) .... The use of multiple ""character"" killers was a nice touch.The biggest let down for me that stops this film getting a much higher score is the dialogue. Although a couple of bits of dialogue didn't fit (""trading hacks"" - in 1994? Not like that), but it was mostly in keeping with the style, so that's not the actual problem.Sadly the dialogue lacked any really depth of wit or charm that might help elevate it from pure homage. There are a couple of loose attempts ""Do you know how expensive AOL is?"" but nothing really lands as memorable dialogue, or even just half smart. We can go as far back as ""They're coming to get you Barbara!"" or Ash's ""Swallow this!"" - sketched in our minds so much we hear them in the original voices - or even just something as amusing in the moment as Scream's ""I could save a man's life. Do you know what that's would do for my book sales?"". I felt like the film needed a Steven Moffat or Simon Pegg on the writing team just to bring some elegance and a smile back to the otherwise functional conversations.So aside from the expositional dialogue, the odd moment of misplaced music and technology, you should probably just accept and enjoy this movie for the light trashy fun it's mean to be.... there's much worse out there to watch.Addendum : With my most geekish hat on, for me, seeing a Commodore Amiga 2000 running AOL on Windows was probably the most painful moment (having known from experience that AOL connections *could* be run on the Amiga in 1998, it would not use their proprietary software) but at that point we really are into the realms of truly specialist knowledge and that shouldn't affect viewing enjoyment... right??",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

Those other reviewers want straight male led characters whose only personality is being an ""alpha type"".These films were brilliantly done and acted. The cast did an amazing job with their respective roles, especially Kiana and Olivia. They played 2 or 4 (you'll see when you watch) characters that stole my heart with a love story within a horror story. Their chemistry made me smile every time they were onscreen. It's incredibly rare to see a story like this fully develop in the way that it did.The parallels throughout the trilogies is mind blowing that I watched them multiple times and said ""oooh"" because I didn't catch that the first time. The story isn't just about murderers and possessed people - but connections that span hundreds of years.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

731,addelayeatkinson,many conflicted feelings.,5,2 August 2021,"First off, the acting in the film is mediocre but not too terrible, the main characters are extremely repulsive in relation to Deena and Sam. Deena is extremely toxic and gets angry at Sam for things she can't even really control and she is extremely manipulative in the sense of Sam's internalized homophobia towards herself and not wanting to come out to others. Sam is just overall very annoying and i really don't see the reason why the characters tried so hard to keep her alive when i feel like everything would've been easier if she had just been killed to begin with. Another complaint is how stupid these characters are. I understand that in most horror movies the characters make stupid decisions but i feel like it was just amplified in this movie. It's just that they seem to make choices in this film that make no sense at all to anyone watching and it just gets irritating when you are like ""You are going to die and you do that..."". Also, there was one thing that i thought was kinda weird was the fact that they used the epipens to save Sam after she drowned, but i don't understand how this saved her when her lungs were filled with water, and her heart wasn't the main priority. Overall, this movie was okay for the purpose of mindless entertainment with a couple friends, but i just couldn't take it seriously with how stupid certain aspects are, the movie was extremely predictable and there wasn't any sort of 90s energy to it except for the recycled fashion which is literally what people are now wearing, and they just played a lot of 90s music to make it seems right. It's okay to watch just to talk about how dumb it was, but it's not anything to take seriously.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The only likable character is josh and even though he's presented like a star character, he is consistently given a backseat to both deena and Sam. I'm not sure where to start with those two. They are so hard to like! The romance is not even slightly sweet, they're both rude and lack any depth. The most depth comes from Simon and the other girl and they're again given a back seat.

739,harrisonmbullard,Possibly the worst modern horror film,3,5 July 2021,"A reminder this review will NOT contain spoilers!!!Okay, when these Fear Street movies were revealed I was extremely excited, as were a lot of other people online. The main reason I was excited was because I'm a huge horror fan, but I was also looking forward to a modern made film to portray the 90's. I thought that a 2021 style horror movie with 90's nostalgia would be great to watch, considering that some of the best horror/slasher movies were in the 90's (Scream, Misery, I know what you did last summer, etc.) but I was very wrong.I know many people are saying this movie is bad because of the way it portrays the 90s but I feel like that is not at all the main reason why this movie is terrible. This movie didn't work for me because of the writing, and acting.The writing was very poor in this film, from random things happening to characters not making any sense whatsoever. The characters in this movie (who we are supposed to like and cheer for) are very poorly written. In fact, the writing actually had me wanting some of the characters to fail more than succeed.The acting was not completely bad EXEPT for the main character, Deena. Okay, I can't tell if I don't like her because of the acting or because of the writing, or a mixture of both. When she is on screen I want to support what she is doing and agree with her actions because she is the main good guy character, but she just ends up being mad about random things that don't make sense and that's what makes it hard for me to like her.Overall this movie was a flop in my opinion, but I am looking forward to the sequel coming out. I think the acting will be better in this film, judging by the cast. Sadie Sink from ""Stranger Things"", Gillian Jacobs, and Drew Schied, who's character in ""Halloween"" 2018"" Oscar was one of my favorites and made me laugh.Thanks for reading.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The only thing that I think fell short was the fact of the ending and what happens to some of the main characters, no say they did not say they live but the movie on a whole is really the set up for the bigger trilogy.

That wasn't the end of it she eventually caused the accident that leads to the disturbance of the witch burial ground thus leading to the death of 5 innocent pple.The plot was all over the place with so many not so good decisions made by the teenagers.

If they had titled the movie ""teens getting slashed"" it might've done better than this.I read all the RL Stine books so I was extremely excited when I heard they were making a movie series for the fear street novels. This movie doesn't have any of the excitement or twists and turns like the books. I understand taking creative liberties but it seems the writers and director just finished high school and decided to turn their video production project into a feature film. The music placement is atrocious, blasting 90s songs at all the wrong times and then just cutting the scenes abruptly to show the next scene without any transitions.They could have done so much with the supernatural themes of monsters, psycho killers, dead boyfriends coming back to life, and everything else from the books that to even think this movie is named after Fear Street is a total travesty.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

I chuckled when my teenager kind of scoffed at me when I eagerly suggested we watch this horror series stemming from my childhood in the late 80s. The books were a frightening popularity growing up. He thought the part 1: 1994 movie wouldn't be that scary, but he was wrong. The opening scene is extremely graphic and disturbing so be forewarned, it's emotional and depicts scenes of a young person being brutally murdered. Expect to see more of that through out, think back to the days of Scream but amped up a bit because now it's 2021. The soundtrack is absolutely incredible and will take you right back to the good ole days of 90s music. You will feel like you're in the time warp you've been trying to find to take you back to pagers, Radiohead and nostalgic 90s America, it's kind of great. That being said it's a classic gore fest and you'll constantly be on the edge of your seat cheering for the characters to escape death while wondering "" OMG where are all the parents at?!"" A bit cheesy but the constant action makes it forgivable. It's definitely not for sensitive viewers or young children.

757,ronaldturnerd,Did they even read the novels?,1,4 July 2021,"So I've been reading through the reviews and I'm surprised that everyone is so focused on the movie not feeling like the 90s. Yes, it's a bunch of GenZers pretending to be from the nineties. Guess what... It's 2021... There is no such thing as a kid who grew up in the nineties today. They're acting and dressing in the manner the script and director want them to. You can't blame them for that, but I certainly believe this movie was made by a millennial completely out of touch with anything 90s.Attention to detail is a big problem with this movie. I had to stop paying attention to all the songs crammed into this movie, some of which didn't exist in 1994 (ie Only Happy When It Rains by Garbage was released in 1995). Some of the slang used in this movie (ie whack) I'd never heard anyone use in real life, and I lived in two different states, so you'd think I'd have heard it at least once, but definitely not in a small town like this movie is set in.Dayglow backpacks? Definitely not cool or common anywhere I lived. Wonder if they'd have incorporated Starter jackets if it had been filmed in winter.Most important... Has anyone actually read the books?

This movie had so much representation and the action, gore and deaths were just utterly amazing. I also feel like the reason most people hate this is because they either didn't understand, just really didn't like it or they are just homophobic. A lot of people are saying it's because the characters had to much ""emotion"" compared to the second which makes no sense and I shouldn't have to explain why it makes no sense. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed the second one but I feel like the first one gets so much hate for no reason when both movies are similar?! If you don't like it for other reasons such as ""it didn't give the 90s vibe""or anything else (that's not harmful to any community) that's totally okay I'm just expressing my opinion and how harmful it felt going to see reviews on this movie that has lgbtq+ rep AND Characters that are minorities.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The only unrealistic thing in my opinion is the killing.. i mean you get stabbed fully but you're still able to stand up and fight with no problem? Very unrealistic.

The set-up was interesting, the characters were fun - I didn't like all of them, but I liked enough. It wasn't a super original dynamic, but I can appreciate the formula of a good slasher film. But after they realize what the witch wants from them, it gets really dumb. Every choice the characters made after that one was terrible.Spoilers belowThey decide they need to kill the girl the witch is after and the way they decide to do that is... a drug overdose? That would literally be at the bottom of the list for a way to kill someone while you are being hunted by multiple killers. So they hole up in a pharmacy and all paint themselves with the targets blood to lure the zombie killers away from the target while she takes like 15 minutes to try and OD. Naturally because this an incredibly stupid plan, they start dying one by one... and suddenly all the interesting characters are dead...They had an ambulance, if they were smart they would have stayed mobile and used the defibrillator to kill the girl.

781,jadeleejadelee,This movie is a bit young surprisingly,3,24 July 2021,"It was difficult to get though. At first when seeing the actress I was thinking is she still playing a teenager? I mean she looks young for her age (28) but back to the plot. This movie is so boring, I could tell it thought it was hot stuff. It's very ""artsy"" with its lighting, side note what's up with these young adult shows and that weird blue and red lighting? It's like an 80s aesthetic? I see it everywhere now. The constant 90s music and you're such a nerd the internet is so new and hahaha remember AOL? It was a little cringe I will admit. I don't remember the 90s at all as I was born just before the year 2000, but judging by the comments of those who did this movie is terribly inaccurate. Im a fan of RL but never read fear street, I may read the books to see if it's any better. I say this movie is young because I think young teens will enjoy it especially if they're new to horror. It curses but if they took that out I could see this being a pg to pg 13 movie if they took the blood out too.I do wonder who this movie is market towards? The plot is very juvenile but then I hear the f bomb every two seconds??? Who's the demographic Netflix?Anyway here's another snarky review from a random internet girl. Peace.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

785,urmumisacow,WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE!,10,28 July 2021,"This movie is INSANE, everything from the subtle characterization the actors demonstrate, to the camera work, the music choice is AWESOME, the whole neon aesthetic is absolutely killer, and The slashers themselves have the COOLEST gimmicks and designs. Easily climbed right to the top of my favorites list, I finish the trilogy only to start over again.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

It was reminiscent of The Classics: Halloween, Friday the 13th, Scream etc. Without being derivative.It has a little something for everyone. Great characters, interesting world building and lesbians who aren't fetishized! Truly a joy from start to finish. I would definitely watch it again.It was not without flaws, but it was a solid slasher movie.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

790,vczyzmc,lower your expectations and have fun,8,2 August 2021,"Honestly the writing is Not Good, but i still enjoyed this trilogy a lot! The 8/10 is enjoyment level, actual quality of film is like, 4/10 lol. Don't expect sophistication. People say it's ""goosebumps for adults"" but aside from some adult themes it still feels like it's for kids/teens. Black lesbian protag is a big plus, and she's a good example of a flawed/unlikeable character who's still a good protagonist imo. Like, i wouldn't want to hang out with her but she makes sense and i don't completely hate her. And i actually really liked the music?? I'm surprised so many people didn't???? Maybe i have bad taste.

That wasn't really the point of the movie. Unlike the majority of the other reviewers, I thought it was a fairly decent movie and I'm glad I watched it. I pretty much liked all of the characters, and the acting was fairly good, especially from the actress playing the lead character. As far as the soundtrack goes, I barely noticed it. I couldn't name one song that was in the movie because it wasn't what I was concentrating on. The only thing that was a bit disappointing to me was the ending, but I'm not going to give anything away.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

804,jccal10,I DONT KNOW...,5,15 August 2021,"I'm really confused by this film, on one hand I enjoyed watching it, but on the other hand... meh. There was far too much going on. It was trying to hit the retro vibe, a slasher film, horror film and a cheesy teen flick. And it didn't get any of it. I think the overall premise was good- just not executed well enough.

The thing came out in 1987.1994 was one of the first years of the internet and one of the last glory years for BBS'es.Going the Amiga route would have been cool but you'd have to had him dial a BBS using Ncomm.

Then, the final installment, puts a nice bow on the whole series. Wouldn't mind seeing more from this, if done right, could make a nice franchise . . . Overall, 8 for the series as a whole, but it's a solid 8. Each movie gives a different feel too, which made the sequels more enjoyable and less repetitive. 80's and 90's horror fans should enjoy, just make sure to give it a fair chance.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
807,nicole_raymond,Huge Let down,4,2 July 2021,"I was really looking forward to this movie. I grew up in the 90's and loved Fear Street books. I had and read the whole series. The movie started out great, in a mall which was totally 90s teen culture. Once the opening credits rolled and they introduced the main characters it was all downhill. The only thing they captured from the 90s was the music, which they ruined by cramming in a different song every 5 seconds in the most random places. That's where the 90s end. The characters are all just a bunch of whiny Gen Zers, trying to dress like they are from the 90s, like typical Gen Zers. Whoever made this should have watched some horror movies from the actual 90s for inspiration, because in Scream, I Know What you Did Last Summer, The Craft, etc... nobody sat around whining about their feelings every five seconds, especially when they were being chased by crazed killers. This movie was also extremely uneven and tried to be too many things at once. Slasher flick, superatural, and cultural warfare between towns, which made no sense and could have just been left out completely. Like the main character breaking up with her girlfriend because she moved one town over. There were cars back then to travel to the next town over, but they make such a big deal out of it you would think it was in the days of the covered wagon. All the constant emotional conversations just made the movie drag when it could have been exciting and fun. It got to the point where I just couldn't wait for it to end. Very disappointing.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
808,sadcash,"Huge fan of horror, but enough with the nostalgia overload.",4,2 July 2021,"I'm aware that I'm in my 40s critiquing essentially a kid's movie, which is ridiculous in its own right, and I thought 80s/90s nostalgia seemed like an ok idea until the dam broke and that's all there is. This also goes for a lot of horror these days : does everyone just have ADD now? I mean, I have ADD, but I cannot deal with jumping around from story point to story point so quickly that there's no time to set up actual atmosphere beyond jumbled throw-away nostalgia, obvious jump scares and ghosts with giant mouths. Proof that atmospheric dread at least used to be possible even in kid horror : Watcher in the Woods, Lemora, Something Wicked this Way Comes, The Gate ... but my main critique of this would be cramming 5 seconds of every 90s song into every scene is the stupidest thing I think I've seen thus far in the new wave of horror. Wanted to like this, but I'd say a little nostalgia goes a long way and also COME UP WITH NEW IDEAS INSTEAD OF WORSHIPING THE PAST. It's like we're all just stuck in a stupid simulation loop. Hopefully it gets broken SOON! (but I doubt it.)",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
809,Barrie_bright,Not that exciting,3,11 July 2021,"Not the worst horror film that's out there, but nowhere near the best.

I don't understand the nasty reviews, it's obvious this movies are for entertainment, not a masterpiece or a life changing event! They were very well produced, the actors were great and maybe there was a bit too much different music on the first one but it felt nice after all.

812,mark_j_smith555,"""Mediocre"" and ""Average"" do not equate to 1 out of 10",6,23 July 2021,"I'm writing a review primarily at my annoyance over the littering of 1 and 2 star reviews that call the movie ""mediocre"", ""average"" or anything similar.The criticisms highlighted across the majority of reviews are all bang on - the abundance of 90's music across all genres is incredibly heavy handed, although it does improve in the second half of the film. The look and feel don't fit the 90's setting especially well and the lead characters are fairly dislikable.But the film was fine - not groundbreaking, not brilliant - just fine. You could even say ""mediocre"" or ""average"" like a lot of other reviews do, which is a pretty accurate assessment.You can not then give the film 1 out of 10.1 out of 10 is the lowest score that can be given to a film on this site. If a 10 out of 10 film is flawless the other end of the spectrum would make a 1 out of 10 film so poorly made it could not be any worse. If you've watched this and consider it the worst film you've ever seen, you haven't seen a lot of films - horror or any genre.It doesn't redefine the genre like a Halloween or Scream, but it was perfectly fine for what it was, and deserving of a 4, 5 or 6 out of 10 depending on your personal take, because mathematically are middling scores when graded out of 10.If you're going to score a film 1 out of 10 and write a review, don't call it ""average"".",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
813,tmcswain-451-459352,Disappointment,1,12 July 2021,"I've probably come to expect too much from my fascination with Stranger Things. I've watched every episode at least 3 times each. With that combined with a respect for Stine's work, I was greatly disappointed with Fear Street: 1994 on every level. This movie just failed to deliver. The character development was nonexistent at best. The way this movie started had me excited. If it only lasted 10-15 minutes, it would have been fantastic, but everything that happens after the first scene is an utter waste of time. I've read good reviews about the second one and give it a chance, but episode 1 has set the bar low... very, very low. To not give away spoilers (if there is such a thing in this movie), the plot is vague, you root for the antagonists because the the protagonists just don't do anything to make you root for them, much of the movie feels like a failed attempt to combine campy 90's nostalgia with campy 90's slasher films - I'm all for nostalgic movies, but this one tries too hard and still doesn't generate a 90's vibe. Honestly, had this been titled Scary Movie 12, I would have enjoyed it more because I would have expected it to be a major cheese fest.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

The music was not bad but it would just go into a song abs when that one ended another one would start up. The kids in the movie sound and acted like like children today. Also I would say the movie did not know what audience it was trying to reach.

Cringey lines and even worse attempts at forming relationships.The characters are awful, I constantly found myself asking "" why tf is the main character so mad ALL the time?!"". The rest are boring and unlikeable.Good playlist but felt like it was trying to hard to be ""cool""? Playing a new song every 2 seconds. The plot had so many holes and some weird scenes that leave you questioning what the hell just happened?Was hoping for a good throwback movie, especially when i seen Maya Hawke in the trailer (sadly she was only in the movie for 0.3 seconds & the rest of the cast didn't resemble anything of an interesting teen movie/series)Boring.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

This movie's soundtrack does not fit in with the scenes at all! The music completely took me out of the movie over and over again. The score wasn't terribly written in and of itself, but most of the time the music just sounds completely random and out of place. It hardly ever fits the scene.Overall this movie is a mediocre netflix slasher. It's one of those bad movies you'll have more fun making fun of than actually watching, but this also kinda makes it worth checking out (at least if you enjoy making fun of stupid movies with friends).",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

One of them was the idea that adults are never really around, and teenagers are left to their own devices. That's why I think every place is empty.At first, I totally get it. I compare the music use to Suicide Squad, where everyone had a theme song. They REALLY wanted you to know it was the 90s. However, after all that went away, Fear Street became watchable.Heroes can have flaws! I get that these characters were annoying, but again they're exaggerations of 90s tropes. I think Fear Street went the whole nine yards with SOME concepts while others were lazier. However, I think of movies like this as alternate universe. Constants and variables. Like how 'It Follows' had a very 80s vibe but they had that clamshell ebook.The biggest theme I picked up from this, and Part Two, is Selfishness to Selflessness. Someone wants to leave Shadyside, but realizes that there's something bigger at play and if they don't help, the city is doomed.

Sometimes unlikeable, but entertaining nonetheless.Fear Street brings a much needed diversity to the classic horror genre, infusing elements of sexuality and identity, often used as quickly killable side plots. Though this characteristic may be a partial reason for the negativity surrounding the reviews, the inclusion of a queer POC protagonist brings a refreshing change to the traditional final girl storyline.With interesting lore and unpredictable turns, I am greatly looking forward to future instalments of the trilogy.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

832,mrbrooks123,Missed Opportunity,5,2 July 2021,"Felt like this movie was a missed opportunity, the storyline was alright but the execution of the 90s vibe was rather lackluster. Didn't have that nostalgia when you're watching Stranger Things or even AHS 1984. One thing that I noticed that didn't make sense was, where is everybody in the film? Other than the main characters, it felt like they were in a ghost town, running around yelling and bleeding without other people noticing. Major plot hole.The cast did okay as a whole, however the lead character, Deena (Kiana Madeira) was extremely unlikable. I don't know if it was maybe the script or what but it was hard rooting for the final girl to survive when you don't even like her. That's another issue this movie has.Overall, it would've been a more enjoyable watch IF the leads were likable.

Instead, it's the story of a Scooby gang involved in a classic townwide mystery involving ancient curses, shady law enforcement, and class/social warfare.I'd say watch it if fluff horror is your thing. I consider this one time spent but not wasted. Plus, it sets up what could be a thousand equally as enjoyable sequels.And yes, they dropped the ball on getting the proper music for the year (which was odd) and they lose points for that. -1 star for that silly and avoidable mistake.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994

839,octtsam,"Off to a Good Start, Then Bad.",3,1 August 2021,"I was really excited when this movie started out. But after watching halfway I feel like I got tricked. There was no consistency to this movie except the characters boring lines and gen Z feelings. I would have rather had older actors playing kids and get a better 90s movie out of it overall.The first scene of the movie was great. Some of the action scenes were ok. But they weren't enough to keep me entertained throughout the whole movie.Cannot connect with any of the characters and their decisions/feelings/characters just make no sense. If I were an actor I would quit if I saw these were the lines/characters I had to play.This movie should just get remade because it could be done WAYY better. 90s music was good but all the songs played in the beginning in such a weird way as if a radio was playing in the background of the movie the first 20 minutes. Then the rest of the movie had like nothing.Also disappointed that half the movie was talking about ODing and it became part of the main plot and they were talking about which pills to take over there and over here and put them into bags, swallow it blah blah blah. Soo bad. SMH. Seriously. This is trash feeding off a 90s vibe horror story we've been wanting for the longest time! Need a remake.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
840,vitaliyhawes,Not the best,2,3 July 2021,This does not deserve high rating as it definitely does not feel like 1994. Poor acting and cliche cuts did not make me enjoy this movie.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
841,laurane_spaens,Entertaining watch,10,4 July 2021,"Honestly I enjoyed this film, and I'm excited for the next ones. This is not super scary, and I don't think it was meant to be, it's just fun.I don't really get the bad reviews, some people are saying it's ""too 90s"" others that it's not enough? Like, this is not historical fiction, I think they were just going with the 90s vibes.I liked the characters and got attached to them. They do stupid things sometimes, but they're kids so that's kind of expected.I'm giving it 10 stars because I think people are being unfair with their bad ratings, tbh.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
842,amazon-74663,I liked it...,7,13 July 2021,"After reading these user reviews, I was sure I was going to hate this movie, but I didn't. It does have some flaws, but it's pretty decent overall. People keep saying that it doesn't capture the 90s, but I think it did a decent enough job at that. The acting was pretty good too. And the violence/gore was on point for the feel they were going for. My only real criticism is that they focused a little too much on a couple of the subplots/relationships.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
843,gmmainente,WTF is this. Stop please.,1,18 July 2021,"WTF. This is the apotheosis of nostalgic movies, every 5 minutes there is a song from the 90s. Yet another American cliché movie, more and more boring. It's not scary, it's not funny.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
844,msveepatrick,Slasher movie for kids,5,25 July 2021,I never write reviews but this movie was a huge letdown. I would let my 11 year old watch this if he wanted.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
845,laurmcn,No hope,5,11 July 2021,"After about 20 minutes into the movie there was no hope of it being decent. Also, The characters seemed off and didn't mesh well.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
846,Tok_sand,"Acting is so bad, it is hard to watch",1,12 July 2021,"Characters are poorly written, and even worse acted.The all plot/dialogues/characters is just not believable.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
847,lyndseyabrady,"Not terrible, but wasted potential",6,11 July 2021,Had such potential from the books! Missed the mark. Opening scene was promising with the similarity to the original Scream opening but not much else worked well. Nothing about it felt 90s. Not sufficiently creepy like the books!,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
848,lesliekassinger,Had high hopes,5,4 July 2021,"I was beyond excited when I saw this on Netflix. The first 5 minutes in the mall started great. Then it felt like a scream knockoff. They do not portray the 90's accurately at all. I agree with a. Previous reviewer who said it was modern trying to be 90's and didn't truly have a 90's vibe. Language, situations, how they handled things...not 90's at all. (I was a teen in the 90's so first hand experience here). This didn't feel like the Feat Street Books I read growing up and this adaptation seemed really far off base. (I still have the original saga-betrayal, secret, burning on my shelf). This movie just misses the mark on everything.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
849,jlipp-31110,Couldn't even finish it.,1,6 July 2021,"I read the books growing up so I figured I would give this movie a shot. The only thing good about the movie is the soundtrack but even that is over done. It's like the directors really wanted everyone to know it's the 90's because there is a different song played every 30 seconds.The acting is bad, the characters aren't easy to like and the story is dumb. If you were a fan of the books, look elsewhere.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
850,gregurichgeorge,Lighting,5,16 July 2021,Did anyone else find it hard to see because of the lighting? Just seemed very dark all the time.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
851,tomberzerker,Really bad,2,2 July 2021,"I was a teenager in the 90s and this is nothing like what it was really like. The clothes are wrong, the hair is wrong, the way they speak is wrong. One kid says 'that's what she said' which no one ever seemed to say until about 2010!Compare that to stranger things which is just like how I remember the 80s. This film really missss the mark.I don't know the source material so I can't compare to that but as a movie it's really bad. Poor writing, two dimensional characters, and a sluggish plot.It gets 2 stars for the soundtrack having some amazing music on it. Soundgarden, Nine Inch Nails, and White Zombie are incredible. Right, I'm off to listen to The Downward Spiral and Astro Creep 2000 while I attempt to erase this movie from my brain.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
852,nataliealcock,Medically soooo incorrect,3,7 July 2021,"This movie was ok as a teen horror movie to begin with getting progressively more gory throughout. The main thing that pulled me out of the story is the ending. I don't understand why people don't research anything medical relates.It is much harder to save someone after a multi-drug and staggered overdose.Epipens would not necessarily help, and the amount used would have killed her anyway
Epipens would not be used to revive someone after drowning
And nobody seems bothered that all the friends died... what.Overall ending made it a bit ridiculous.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
853,damitorres,Such a cheesy movie,6,19 July 2021,"I feel like I would've really liked this movie if I were still 15 years old. First of all, I hate the main character; she's such a downer and is so hard to like at any point of the movie. The ending was ridiculous too! Such a disappointment.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
854,pollenita,Misogynists need not watch,10,11 September 2021,"This Trilogy is another great move by Netflix to fix the gender and minority gap that exists in Hollywood. Like Gunpowder Milkshake this trilogy shows complex female characters many men and misogynists would not understand or respect. This is a fictional series and as such there are fictional aspects such as music from the wrong year, if you expect non-fiction accuracy with your fictional horror flicks, this is not the movie for you. The soundtrack is one that will be nostalgic to many but especially for people from the 90s. The stories are compelling and human. It is understood all humans are flawed and women aren't just sex symbols. Most of the complaints about this movie are complaints about the female and marginalized perspective being portrayed in the movie and most critics being men used to men centered stories who can't understand female centered stories because of their misogyny.This movie is smart. This movie takes real witchcraft practices and makes them literal in this campy, female centered story about the downfalls of marginalization.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
855,sarahnratcliff,This was awful.,1,5 July 2021,"It was truly awful. The beginning gave me Scream vibes which had me excited and the music was awesome. Other than that, it was bland, the acting was awful and I couldn't wait for it to be over. 😂",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
856,kikib-81219,Only great after you watch the full trilogy!,7,21 August 2021,"Number 1 was ok, but number 2 and 3 really brought the story together! This became so much fun to watch!",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
857,bradlymcconnell,One star only for having a decent opening soundtrack.,1,7 July 2021,This was horrible and I hope a Part 2 isn't funded so I'm not tempted to give them a second chance.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
858,starello87,Don't watch if you expect Fear Street,3,4 July 2021,"As a self declared fear street book nerd that grew up in the 90's absolutely obsessed with these books I just found the entire movie stupid and disappointing. I guess I'm getting too old for this generations' view of the world. Would probably appeal to teens of the Riverdale scene but if you are hoping for a true nostalgic tribute to a great book series, then don't bother watching. Shouldn't be called Fear Street,",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
859,dianabell,trash film,1,17 July 2021,Kills all your fave characters for no reason ? Aka the only characters that made this movie not so entirely boring that you couldn't sit through it.,Fear Street - Part One - 1994
860,tiffanyl-93772,Wes Cravens scream,4,6 July 2021,"So many details and actions and scenes that mirrored 1996 scream or copied it completely.Its not a bad movie, its just a great value version of Scream.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
861,woelfle-59889,Not what I was expecting.,6,7 August 2021,"A decent movie with some classic tropes and a few surprises that I enjoyed. The characters weren't necessarily likable but were okay. Story wise, it could have been a bit stronger, but knowing there are two additional parts allowed me to enjoy the mystery and look forward to learning the rest later.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
862,arianfetahaj,Unwatchable,1,3 July 2021,"Poor writing, poor acting, poor cinematography, poor audio. Its writing is extremely cringy with completely worthless relations that the creators of the film were to lazy to properly invest time in because thez thought why bother when the majority will be killed off anyways, right? You have characters dying because they wanted to help, but no one gives a damn. You have music blowing your ears off almost constantly, trying to build up drama/tension because the visuals are not able to pull it off. The lighting and overall cinematography looks like a cheap Stranger Things knock-off, like the gaffers/dop just recently got their hands on RGB lights for the first time. Feels like a trashy music video, not a feature film. The performances are also quite bad but I won't blame the actors, because it would be pretty hard to act convincingly with this script. Overall a literal waste of time, resources and oxygen. I wish I could unsee it.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
863,charlii-39324,FEAR STREET FOR THE MEEK,6,8 July 2021,"So far, Fear street is leagues above any cw tween crap fest but that's not saying much. A song from the 90s interjects every 10 mins or so, the characters are not as thought out and logical as the book variants. I can't decide if they're purposely going for the 90s cheese angle or, are just crap when it comes to writing. The editing is too fast at times which makes it seem like the characters over talk the other characters. The speech and inflections even seem erratic or not fully developed yet in many scenes. The typical girl shriek that erodes any of the suspense that was trying to be created.The idiotic explanations for jock fueled assaults are ridiculous. The blatantly stupid police force and townsfolk. Either the town is cursed and everyone is somehow affected or the writing again, is just terrible. Gore wise it is pretty good and at least it's still mature to a degree. The dialogue though just kills whatever could have been good development for the character and plot. Overall I give this a legit 6/10. The main audience for this ranges from 13-20. Unless you're into rehashed horror themes, plots, exposition, and tween based bs then just skip this. Or watch it drink/high.In these matters who's to blame? The writers, producers, and or directors? It feels like they had something and yet, still succumbed to the pitfalls of book to show adaptations.",Fear Street - Part One - 1994
