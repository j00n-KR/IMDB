0,MartinHafer,Great special effects and action--dumb script,3,1 March 2008,"Well, after seeing this film I would have to say that this is about the worst Tim Burton directed film I have ever seen--mostly because the script is hopeless. The problem seems to be that although a fortune was spent making the town of Sleepy Hollow for the film as well as doing some incredible stunts, no one seemed to have bothered making sure the script was up to snuff. The bottom line is that cool decapitation scenes are not enough to carry this movie and it seems as if the film is designed for undiscriminating audiences.So what's so bad about the script? Well, it didn't bother me that practically none of the film was based on the original story--after all, that was a short story and it would have made a relatively dull 15 minute movie. No, instead the problem was that the story just seemed to revolve around just action and special effects. So much of the dialog seemed pointless and sloppy. In particular, late in the film, Miranda Richardson goes on a long-winded exposition in order to explain the film--like she was reading from a script in order to explain what had happened to the audience. In addition, there were so many needless story elements--particularly those about Ichabod's childhood that seemed so needlessly antagonistic towards Christianity as well as a strong bent in favor of ""white witchcraft"". Throw in a silly and pointless meeting with a witch with no eyeballs, 18 decapitations, tons of gratuitous blood and you're left with a film that bears much more resemblance to THE GRUDGE or Friday THE 13TH than THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW! If you like dumb big budget films or will watch anything that teams Johnny Depp and Tim Burton, then this movie is for you. Otherwise, try any of their other pairings--such as the excellent films CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY, CORPSE BRIDE or SWEENEY TODD.",Sleepy Hollow
1,TheLittleSongbird,Unique and beautifully crafted,9,2 May 2010,"As I like Tim Burton, and I am fond of the timeless story, I was eager to see what this 1999 film was like. I also grew up on the Disney classic The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the Headless Horseman creeped me out so badly when I was little I thought I would never see the day when I would see that topped. Now after seeing this I think I just have. The Headless Horseman is terrifying here, Christopher Walken does a phenomenal job playing him. I do agree that the story does drag on occasions, but plenty makes up for that minor fault. Visually, Sleepy Hollow is amazing, like Batman Returns and Edward Scissorhands, the sets and cinematography are dark and Gothic, and the special effects are wonderful. Also Tim Burton I think was the perfect choice for director, he is oddball and eccentric and that directorial style is perfect for this film allowing him to give a clever, unique and atmospheric take on the story. The music score by none other than maestro Danny Elfman is dark, suspenseful and haunting, like it should be. The story is a true timeless tale of horror, and really well structured here, as is the nuanced script. The performances are excellent once again, with Johnny Depp absolutely brilliant as the maverick yet intuitive Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci fine in a poignant sort of way as the lovely Katerina. Solidly supporting them all the way are Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths. And of course the film is full of cruel shocks and thrills, the murder scenes are shocking and violent but not in the sense that you have to look away. Overall, very unique and beautiful take on the tale. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Sleepy Hollow
2,bkoganbing,You Can't Reason With A Headless Man,9,19 September 2010,"Any resemblance between Washington Irving's whimsical tale of the Hudson Valley and this Tim Burton Gothic horror fest is purely coincidental. Of course that does not mean the film isn't good. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp have combined their talents to make a really good film.The original short story involved a bumpkin of a man in Ichabod Crane in love with Katrina Van Tassel who is also being courted by the local jock of the village Brom Bones. When he starts to get serious though the legendary headless horseman who is reputed to be the ghost of a Hessian mercenary from the revolution goes after Ichabad one dark and stormy night and he clears out of Sleepy Hollow. Irving is most cryptic about just what was the Headless Horseman that night.Instead of the bumpkin, Ichabad Crane is transformed into a Sherlock Holmes type constable sent from New York to uncover the mystery behind several beheadings. That's the character that Johnny Depp plays and he's soon courting Christina Ricci as Katrina to the jealousy of Casper Van Dien as Brom Bones.Tim Burton took and expanded the story and we meet the village of Sleepy Hollow who are living in mortal fear. But as Sherlock Holmes would say there is method in the seeming randomness of the Horseman and his victims. It's quite the convoluted plot that brews in Sleepy Hollow. Not only did Tim Burton get a great ensemble performance from his cast, but the film did a great job in recreating the Hudson Valley and at the beginning and end of the film, New York City in the Federalist era of the country. Great Gothic sets, I think Burton was inspired by some of the horror classics that Universal used to do back in the days of the studio system.In addition to those already mentioned, Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson as Mr.&Mrs. Van Tassel, Michael Gough as the village notary and in flashback Christopher Walken as the Horseman before he went headless should all be singled out.Sleepy Hollow is a well done film and even though it is more Tim Burton than Washington Irving it will give you more than a few frights. As for Johnny Depp as his portrayal was more Sherlock Holmes than Ichabad Crane, perhaps he'll consider doing a Sherlock Holmes movie as a future project. We can only hope.",Sleepy Hollow
3,Leofwine_draca,Rich Gothic horror let down by generic action scenes,6,22 December 2016,"Tim Burton's latest film takes the classic short story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving and gives it a makeover for the modern audience. He also manages to include much of the eccentricity seen in his work, in everything from the fairytale story of EDWARD SCISSORHANDS to his recent cartoon violence in MARS ATTACKS!. While Burton succeeds admirably in creating a brilliant visual portrayal of a Gothic landscape, much touted as a return to the ways of Hammer, the script lets him down as plausibility and story are thrown out of the window in favour of outlandish action sequences, all of which bear more resemblance to LETHAL WEAPON 4 (carriage and horse chases substituted for car chases) than our favourite horror movies of the past.The film also remains unnecessarily light-hearted and even comic in places, as if to reassure us that Burton may be the master of weirdness, but he's still a little boy with a sense of humour at heart. Unfortunately for us, this mars the film dreadfully, as the horrors of the situation simply cannot be taken seriously when Depp is constantly fainting and minor characters are engaging in skirmishes with the supposedly indestructible ghost. Yes, it does turn (just like at the finale of END OF DAYS) into TERMINATOR 2 again, with the headless horseman substituted for the liquid metal man, i.e. an unstoppable killer who cannot be destroyed by any physical means.At least the sets are marvellous, and the film furnished with dark, rich colours which really set it apart and makes it look like a painting. The woods are wonderfully spooky, with plenty of dry ice floating about, the houses themselves distorted and grotesque. In another nod to Burton's favourite horror movies, plenty of discussion takes place in open graveyards, full of leaning headstones and recently-dug graves. A lot of work has gone into costumes, making them colourful and pretty, yet realistic, while Crane's odd set of medical instruments brings to mind the twisted gynaecological creations of the brothers in Cronenberg's DEAD RINGERS.As SLEEPY HOLLOW was filmed in Britain, the cast itself is mainly composed of British actors and actresses, with only three people I can think of off the top of my head American. For the genre fan, the cast is wonderful. Christopher Lee sets things off with a cameo appearance at the beginning, with his booming voice put to good use in a court. It's nice to see that Lee is authoritative and powerful as ever, the years haven't blunted his acting skills, just a shame that he's been caught up in mediocre rubbish for the past two decades. At his side is Alun Armstrong, who made it big in BRAVEHEART and whose distinctive features are familiar to any television/film watcher this side of the Atlantic. Michael Gough, star of countless exploitation cheapies like HORROR HOSPITAL and many more, appears in a scene-stealing role as a harmless old man who solemnly warns of death and destruction for our hero (""their heads... taken by the headless horseman!""). Other familiar faces such as Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths, and Miranda Richardson flesh out the cast, as well as Ian McDiarmid, more familiar to sci-fi audiences for his role as Emperor Palpatine in RETURN OF THE JEDI. The only out of place actor is Casper Van Dien, who would be more at home shooting or fighting people I feel, his sword fight with the ghost really ruining the impact of the film for me and equating it to some silly adventure flick like THE MASK OF ZORRO.Johnny Depp is a good actor but his character in this film is an irritating, wimpish one who we just wish would stop fainting and playing the fool all the time. Perhaps this is supposed to be funny, but I didn't think so. Christina Ricci is well suited to this film, as her fragile beauty is made all the more noticeable by something distinctly weird in her features - the ideal actress for Tim Burton. And it would be unfair to miss out Christopher Walken, who looks like a vampire from SALEM'S LOT and chews the scenery with relish.Unfortunately, once again, somebody somewhere decided that we needed some poor computer animation for our shocks, so a witch does a ridiculous gurn just like the title creature in THE MUMMY, which really detracts from the spirit of the thing. If Burton wanted to stay traditional, why did he include this stupid scene of someone's eyes bursting out of their head like Jim Carrey in THE MASK? CGI is used well at the end for the horseman's face growing back on to his skull, but frankly I'd rather stick with the prosthetics of HELLRAISER instead. At least we can be grateful that Burton doesn't skimp on the beheadings, so there is plenty of splashed, bright red blood and flying bonces at regular intervals. Don't start thinking this film is a gore fest though, because although gore is used, it's done sparingly and not graphic as some people seem to think.Did SLEEPY HOLLOW send me to sleep? No, not really, because I was too caught up in the visuals to notice the generic action scenes and silly plot twists. By the time a conspiracy had been exposed I was simply tired of the whole thing and wished that they would go back to the old days where the monster was simply there, and there was no reason for it, it just was. The need for minute explanations is a really trying one and it threatens to bring the whole film down in this case. Thankfully it doesn't, though, and SLEEPY HOLLOW is a feast for the eyes with enough references to Bava's BLACK Sunday and plenty of other Gothic horror flicks to keep the fan entertained. It's just a shame that Andrew Kevin Walker (writer of SEVEN) couldn't come up with something a little more mature and a little less stupid.",Sleepy Hollow
4,SnoopyStyle,great Tim Burton look,7,5 May 2015,"It's 1799. NYC police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is bucking the system using modern forensic methods and being berated for it. The Judge sends him off to investigate the beheading murders in the small town of Sleepy Hollow. Wealthy Peter Van Garrett, his son Dirk and the widow Emily Winship are all found without their heads. He is boarding with Baltus Van Tassel and falls for his daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci). The elders recount the tale of a Hessian (Christopher Walken) who was beheaded during the Revolutionary war and has reborn into the headless horseman.Tim Burton brings a brilliant dark moody foggy atmosphere. I love all the designs and the look. Johnny Depp is also terrific as a science geek. I like that he's a weakling and not necessarily the heroic type. Although he has determination. Depp adds a good deal of fun. The horror element isn't very scary but it is fun. It's definitely a movie more intrigued with the style than being a thrilling horror.",Sleepy Hollow
5,Hitchcoc,Please Don't Call It a Remake of the Washington Irving Story,7,30 December 2016,"Come on. If it weren't for the names of the characters, including the Headless Horseman, we wouldn't have clue that this had anything to do with the original. A remake has to have something to do with the original plot, even if it's butchered. For God's sake, Ichabod Crane is a police detective!? He comes to investigate murders using forensic techniques. Katrina Van Tassel is a potential suspect. Remember that Ichabod, in the original movie, was the victim. So let's let that go. If this is just a period piece it's a decent movie. It is well constructed and has some really interesting plot development. The detective must wade through the provincial prejudices against him and try to solve the murders. I suppose most of the people who went to this film had never read the original, but it bothers me that the title and characters have any connection to that story.",Sleepy Hollow
6,Horst_In_Translation,Don't lose your head,6,14 November 2013,"The 1999 film ""Sleepy Hollow"" is another collaboration between Johnny Depp (in his mid-30s at that point), already a huge star back then, and Tim Burton almost 10 years after the great ""Edward Scissorhands"". This story has been done many many times back until the early silent days of cinema, but Burton's take probably took over from the animated short film version from 1949 as the most common adaptation of this horror tale. If you didn't know it was by Tim Burton or about his affection with the supernatural, you could still think early on, this was not a mystery tale, but a crime story. The protagonist hears about a couple of beheadings in another town and travels there believing some mass murderer was on the run. When he is played a prank on by some of the locals who dress up as the headless horseman, this tendency stays alive. However, when Ichabod Crane runs for the first time into the real monster, it becomes clear that something supernatural is taking its course.While I was admittedly never too interested in the story, it still made for a good watch. Especially Christopher Walken is a perfect casting choice for his part and Christina Ricci looks like a gloomy version of a mysterious modern Disney princess here. Michael Gambon I occasionally mistook for Geoffrey Rush and that's of course really a compliment. I'm more of a fan of invisible danger and horror à la ""Blair Witch Project"" than of Burton's mostly very graphic style, so I wasn't really scared, but I was entertained for the most part. The finale got a bit messy admittedly, but that shouldn't take the focus from how solid everything before that is, especially the visual side, but that's almost a given with Burton. The effects, the bleak landscapes and the whole setting are certainly the highlight of the film. Lovers of mystery films will probably have a much better time watching this one than I did, but even if I'm not too eager on watching it in the near future again, I'd also recommend it to everybody else who's not completely opposed to the genre and even then you could still enjoy it from the period piece angle.",Sleepy Hollow
7,mark.waltz,You may find yourself laughing so hard that it will be hard to keep your head attached...,8,27 March 2014,"O.K., any film director who can make you laugh at the sight of heads being chopped off (not to mention throats slit) is my kind of director. Tim Burton has been keeping me laughing ever since he had Pee Wee Herman ask where the basement in the Alamo was. Then, he had me sobbing (along with the Danny Elfman music) to Johnny Depp making ice sculptures in ""Edward Scissorhands"", martians chatting unstop in ""Mars Attacks!"" while dissolving people, and of course, the newly dead learning how to scare the living in ""Beetlejuice"". All of these films are now modern classics, and ""Sleepy Hollow"" is up there because of the artistic way it has modernized Washington Irving's classic and the themes of vengeance and terror it combined to make a riveting view of hell on earth.From the moment you see Johnny Depp here, you are back in his Chaplin- esque world of screen acting, a true artist at work, and the Lon Chaney of our modern film world. He is an eccentric who has no idea he's eccentric, and when you see him suddenly being squirted by the blood of the dead as he operates on them, you instantly are given a priceless reaction that isn't ""eew"", but ""I knew that was going to happen."" Depp's Ichabod Crane isn't the tall, skinny scaredy cat of the classic animated film, but a sexy crime fighter whose mind has been warped by the lessons learned in childhood. ""Villainy wears many masks. None so dangerous as the face of virtue"", he says, and that is evidenced here, first by the religiously intolerant father who murdered his mother for apparent devil worship, and then by the seemingly noble perpetrator of all the evil that the headless horseman (Christopher Walken in flashbacks) must commit in order to be reunited with his missing face.There's an art to making decapitations funny, and Tim Burton works overtime to make each one of them memorable. Just as he did with ""Sweeney Todd"", Burton prevents making them gory by making them hysterically funny. Yes, there is plenty of blood and carnage, and two deaths are extremely gruesome. But when heads roll, they sometimes spin first, unable to ask questions later, and in one case, Depp finds one of the heads rolling towards him in a particularly vulnerable area. Then, there is the ""tree of the dead"", a visual so evil looking, that it can only be described as the entrance to another world best not visited. The next time you walk through a park or through wooded areas, you will notice trees of many different shapes and may even spot one that at night will appear much spookier than it is during the day.The cast is uniformly excellent, with Christina Ricci an appropriately vulnerable heroine (whose motives are always in question), Miranda Richardson as unforgettable as always (here, resembling Glenn Close in ""Fatal Attraction""), and a supporting cast of male stage and screen vets who each contribute in one way or another. Richard Griffiths is particularly fine as the local magistrate, and of course, Walken (doing nothing but a Frankenstein grunt) makes his evil character totally menacing. This is one of those films that you might find yourself watching over and over again (like most Tim Burton films) and sharing with those who haven't seen it. In spite of the gory nature of the story, the laughs come frequent, are never juvenile or gratuitous, and add to the fun and fast-moving nature of the Gothic tale being unfolded.",Sleepy Hollow
8,gavin6942,Tim Burton and Horror is a (Super)Natural Combination,7,29 May 2009,"Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent away from New York City to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, where he can use his unorthodox detective skills without bothering anybody... and maybe solve a murder along the way. What he stumbles on is not just any murder, but an ongoing killing spree of epic proportions.Anyone who is familiar with Tim Burton's work is going to wonder why he doesn't do more horror films. ""Ed Wood"", ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Nightmare Before Christmas"", ""Sweeney Todd"", and others have that dark vibe... even his Batman films were rather dark compared to other incarnations. How can this be his only true horror flick? It is done so well.And, of course, he wasn't alone... this is the product of skilled people across the board. It was written by Andrew Kevin Walker (""Brainscan"", ""Seven"", ""8MM"") and produced by Francis Ford Coppola, two horror veterans that are never bad to have around.The cast? Ricci, Depp, Walken, Lee, Jeff Jones... each one could get a paragraph of praise. I don't know that this is the best work of either Ricci or Depp, but even their less than best work is better and more entertaining than most others in the acting profession today. And together? A dream come true, if you're a Ricci fan -- Depp already knows how to interact with Burton, so that's a given.The film itself is great in the art department, lighting, cinematography... more or less in every way. It's a very polished, very artsy film. What you may not notice is the use of forced perspective, which I think they hid very well. Most of the outdoor shots were actually shot on set, so if you pay close attention you'll notice that you can never see too far back or too far in the sky... and camera angles were chosen to skew distances. It's a clever tactic and works.The film's audio commentary with Tim Burton is slightly disappointing, and not nearly as good as the film itself. He talks about the difficulty in finding cardinals, and jokes about Dutch masters, but doesn't offer as much insight as you may expect from a director. Many commentaries have a steady discussion going, but Burton seems comfortable to stay silent often and just watch his own film. If this film ever gets deluxe treatment, hopefully a second commentary is added because Burton -- as soothing as his voice is -- can't do it alone.",Sleepy Hollow
9,lee_eisenberg,it's time for everything to go in one direction,7,21 May 2005,"Everyone knows ""The Tale of Sleepy Hollow"". Well, here Tim Burton has tweaked it a little. In this case, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a New York City constable in 1799 who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate some bizarre decapitations. In the process, he not only gets interested in Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), but he also discovers a small-scale conspiracy relating to a bloodthirsty Hessian soldier (Christopher Walken) who was beheaded during the Revolutionary War.As usual, Tim Burton puts an interesting spin on everything. Maybe some parts are a bit overdone, mainly Johnny Depp's overacting, but the whole movie will definitely have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.",Sleepy Hollow
10,jboothmillard,Sleepy Hollow,8,18 March 2005,"Director Tim Burton (Beetlejuice, Batman, Edward Scissorhands, Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) has created some scary, creepy, weird and wonderful films, and this is another success. Burton favourite Johnny Depp stars as Ichabod Crane, a Constable assigned to investigate murders taking place in an unknown town called Sleepy Hollow. On the day of arrival at the Hollow he meets and falls in love with Katrina Van Tassell (Christina Ricci), daughter of Baltus Van Tassell (Sir Michael Gambon). It is Mr. Van Tassell who tells Ichabod that the murders are done by a Headless Hessian Horseman (Christopher Walken). Ichabod does not believe that there is a horseman like this, until he actually sees him. He is now on the hunt for this horseman and trying to find reasons for these murders, besides wanting his head back! Also starring Miranda Richardson as the nasty Lady Van Tassel, Jeffrey Jones as Reverend Steenwyck, Christopher Lee as Burgomaster, Richard Griffiths as Magistrate Philipse, Michael Gough as Notary Hardenbrook and Lisa Marie (Burton's fiancée at the time) as Ichabod's Mother (in his dreams). It is a good mystery with some good horror moments, particularly decapitations.

11,ccthemovieman-1,"Strong, Mixed Emotions On This One",8,26 February 2006,"This is one of the few films I still watch despite it going against my principles. Like a black man not wanting to have any part of a movie that has racist overtones in it, I, as a Christian, feel likewise with the anti-Christian bias in this film.I'm just such a freak for great visual movies that it's hard for me not to view this DVD every few years as it is one of the most stunning films - cinematography- wise - I have ever seen. Anyway, this visual feast also offers interesting characters and an intriguing story, all of which make the 105 minutes fly by. For the record, what offended me was the overt promotion of ""science"" over Biblical faith. The Bible is pictured several times, always in a negative connotation, portraying Believers as nothing but superstitious bigots. The reverend in the film is pictured as just as corrupt as the town leaders. Meanwhile, Depp - the good guy in here who solves the crime - points out that science of course has the answer to every question man could have. In addition, the occult is given credence, something the Bible says should not be. So you see why I have trouble with this movie in a number of regards.But, despite all that, ii is not so heavy-handed as to deter me from enjoying the incredible visuals - one of the top ten best-looking films I've seen out of almost 10,000 - and the fact that it's an extremely interesting story with almost no profanity, either. I just look at it as a far-fetched fantasy and enjoy the wild ride.",Sleepy Hollow
12,rmax304823,Voloptuous and spooky.,6,29 December 2006,"To tell the truth, I was a little confused by the plot. Yes, it's true. The story that used to be on every high school reading list lost me here and there. I can't remember the original, but did it really include so much detail about family trees and inheritances and local conspiracies to hide forbidden truths? It's hard to believe that it did.It probably doesn't matter that the story is confusing at times because the cinematography and set design are are so resplendently dismal as to be spooky in themselves. And if the constant twilight, the desaturated colors, the late Fall atmosphere, the general gloom of both the interiors and exteriors don't creep you out, there's always the Headless Hessian Horseman with his flailing blades. (He twirls them around in his hands like a gunfighter's six-shooters and they have this swishing sound.) The acting is pretty good too. Johnny Depp seems a little stiff at time but maybe the part calls for it. Christina Ricci looks almost edible with her wide forehead, enormous doll-like eyes, and diminutive splanchnocranium. The supporting players are all just fine, including Christopher Lee, with the exception of the kid who serves as Crane's sidekick. He sounds as if he's still practicing his lines.The story has a couple of false starts. Depp is first set up as a kind of visionary Sherlock Holmes type. He has invented new tools for investigating crime scenes. But none of them is explained and he is seen using them only once, for a purpose we can't define. We expect him, based on this early exposition, which leads to his exile from New York City to Sleepy Hollow, to be a scientific genius. But that's soon gotten out of the way. It isn't long before he meets the Horseman himself and realizes he's dealing with the supernatural.At that point, alas, the movie begins to lean more heavily on the clichés of the slasher movie. People do stupid things that put them in danger, for instance. Having just run away from the Horseman and knowing they are still being stalked by him, two guys stop running, turn around, and stare into the fog to see if their pursuer will show up. (Huh?) The constituents of the slasher movie are always there, lurking in the mist, ready to attack at any moment, like the Headless Horseman (and I DO mean ""headless""). The very first murder, in the opening few minutes, has a guy in a cornfield get his head lopped off and we see the blood splatter across the face of a Jack o' Lantern. Almost all the heads are chopped off graphically on the screen although there isn't that much blood, thanks. I suppose that kids, who ought to enjoy this movie, were part of the intended audience so the gore was contained.As for the Horseman himself -- well, I don't think I like him too much. He's presented as an immortal action figure. He's always in motion, galloping a horse at full speed, striding quickly around. He's dressed in a black cloak over black armor, which is alright, but I think he might have been spookier if he'd been less energetic and more of a plodding, implacable menace. The staging of his attacks are low-brow. There are sword fights out of any number of action movies, with two antagonists, flashing blades, twirling figures, swishing and clanking sounds -- all to no purpose since it's already known that the Horseman can't be beaten. At least they didn't throw in any flying kicks from the Chop Sockey movies.But the figure himself is really terrifying, especially when we don't have a clear view of him. The parts I enjoyed most were simply those in which frightened people were whispering in the shadows. The look and the feel of the late 18th-century Hudson Valley are admirably conveyed, though even that is a little too heavily laid on. Can't remember a single scene that takes place in broad daylight. It's as if the sun didn't exist in Sleepy Hollow.",Sleepy Hollow
13,Tweekums,Heads will roll...,8,29 June 2009,"This film has a macabre atmosphere as one would expect from Tim Burton, it feels more like a dark fairy tale than a horror film... although like many fairy tales it has its gruesome moments which means it isn't suitable for children.Johnny Depp plays Ichabod Crane a New York City policeman in 1799 who is sent upstate to the village of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate a recent spate of murders. Each has one thing in common, the victim has been decapitated and their head taken. The locals tell Ichobod that they have been killed by a headless horseman who was killed during the War of Independence. As the death toll increases he grows to believe that the people aren't being killed at random, being a logical detective however he doesn't believe that anything supernatural is involved, not until he sees the horseman with his own eyes. While investigating he is rather smitten Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of the the town's headman, he is also assisted by Young Masbath, a boy orphaned by the horseman.The film full of good actors, not least Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci in the lead roles, the lesser roles are nearly all played top quality character actors who viewers will recognise from other well known films. The special effects are good, especially the numerous decapitations. I would definitely recommend this to fans of Tim Burton or of fantasy horror in general so long as they are mid-teens or older, it is a bit too gory for younger viewers.",Sleepy Hollow
14,ma-cortes,Stunning version of Washington Irving novel with particular Tim Burton style,7,5 November 2007,"Enjoyable version about known Washington Irving's novel, titled ¨The legend of Sleepy Hollow¨. It concerns on Ichabod Crane(excellently personified by Johnny Depp). He's a N.Y. constable assigned to investigate brutal murders in a little town named Sleepy Hollow. Crane is housed by Balthus Van Tassel(Michael Gambon), whose beautiful daughter(Christina Ricci) falls in love for him. At the beginning Crane denies to believe that a rider without head committing the grisly killings, but he's early convinced when seeing the graphic evidence of his own hands. Meanwhile, wealthy authorities and rich proprietaries (Richard Griffiths,Ian McDiarmid,Michael Gough,Michael Gambon) from village reunite to planning and defending against the amazing beheaded creature.Finally, all it leads to an unexpected twist and breakthrough ending on what's happened before.This is an agreeable and effective film, still has shock value from grisly killings .It's proceeded with a Burton style and containing colorful images and wonderful dreams with Burtonized narrative. The movie is plenty on suspense, thriller, grisly terror and sensationalistic set pieces horror when the decapitations take place. Wide use of gore and now famous decapitation , for those who like this kind of things. Casting frankly extraordinary with several famous actors and exceptional secondary cast and special cameos by Martin Landau and Christopher Lee .Glimmer cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and sensational musical score by Danny Elffman, both are Burton's usual. The film is lavishly produced by Francis Ford Coppola-Zeotrope studios- and Kevin Yagher-famous makeup expert- .The motion picture is marvellously directed with visual style and fair-play by the great Tim Burton.

15,moonspinner55,Darkly comic rendering done with self-conscious style and a sneer,6,10 December 2006,"Realistic decapitations--and what a host of them there are!--generally are not the stuff of dark comedy, but director Tim Burton manages a scary chuckle or two at these blood-spattered dirty doings in a Dutch farming village at the turn of the century. What's afoot? Revenge, a little black magic, and a headless horseman serving as an assassin. Adaptation of Washington Irving's story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" from screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker (working from his original treatment co-written with Kevin Yagher) has atmosphere to spare, also a loose, amiable cast (with the sole exception of a too-modern Christina Ricci as Katrina). Still, the pall of the grisly killings becomes tiresome after a while; this coupled with the bleak scenario may be prove too much for restless viewers. The screenplay isn't as solid as one might hope; why, for instance, do the residents start shutting their windows when Icabod Crane first comes into town? What are they afraid of--a resolution? And why set an escape sequence in a weathered windmill when the windmill's demise is all that's delivered? The finale is well-done, although the wherefore and why of the legend may come as a let-down to some (it was probably a daunting task for Walker as well). The film is certainly an eyeful, and a prime example of Burton's intriguing mix of self-enamored slyness, self-conscious style, slick visuals and gleeful bloodlust. **1/2 from ****",Sleepy Hollow
16,paul_haakonsen,Visual masterwork from Burton...,7,10 January 2016,"This 1999 version of the legend of Sleepy Hollow as told through the visionary director Tim Burton really stands out as being unique in many ways. First of all, and most noticeably, is the visuals and the typical Burton style of images. And that is something that really makes ""Sleepy Hollow"" an impressive movie to look at. But it is also the very impressive ensemble of casted talents that make the movie come to life so well on the screen.Without going to much into detail about the storyline, as we should all be familiar with the legend of Sleepy Hollow. Then this is the story about Ichabod Crane who comes to Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate some mysterious deaths where the victims are found without their heads.If you are familiar with other works of Tim Burton then you know what kind of setting and level of detail you are getting into here. And everything in ""Sleepy Hollow"" has exactly that. And personally I do love his unique style.The story was well told by Burton and there was a good pace to the storytelling, and a good continuous flow to the movie. So the 105 minutes that the movie runs for fly by in no time.Now, the impressive thing about ""Sleepy Hollow"" is the cast. That was just spectacular. Of course you have Johnny Depp in the lead, and here again he shows how great in collaboration with Burton that he is, and his acting was spot on for the role of Ichabod Crane. Normally I am not much of a fan of Christina Ricci, but she did a good job here. Miranda Richardson is as always phenomenal and she was so well-cast for her role. Furthermore, there are impressive talents such as Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid and Michael Gough on the cast list. And although he has not a single line in the movie, then Christopher Walken was really great in the role as the Hessian Horseman.""Sleepy Hollow"" is a very entertaining movie, regardless of you being a Burton fan or not. The story is well told, and what is there not to like about the legendary tale of the headless horseman. And furthermore, it is the type of movie that can be watched again and again.",Sleepy Hollow
17,dbdumonteil,another Tim Burton winner,8,7 June 2007,"The strange, the bizarre, old legends have always fed Tim Burton's imagination and so, he had to discover and to get enthusiastic about the legend of the Headless Horseman. At the very end of the eighteenth Century, Ichabot Crane (Johnny Depp) is a young inspector who only trusts rationality to clarify the numerous murders in New York and he is indignant at the imprisoning ways for the culprits. To put his convictions to the test, the leaders of the city send him in a small isolated village, Sleepy Hollow to investigate on a series of murders committed by a mysterious headless horseman. As it was expected, his rational thoughts collapse but don't stop him from slowly garnering clues about the horseman. The whole affair involves manipulation, witchcraft and the authorities of the village seem to be the targets of ""the monster"".Every time we're about to discover a Tim Burton piece of work, we can be sure of one thing that can be proof of artistic achievement: the aesthetic beauty that shrouds many of the filmmaker's works. From this perspective, ""Sleepy Hollow"" is an aesthetic refinement with its somber cinematography that highlights the disquieting landscapes, especially when the headless horseman appears. But also the shady places of the village. Black and gray are the prevailing colors of this Gothic tale. This visual splendor redeems certain clumsy steps of the plot where the interest somewhat depletes like for instance the moment when Depp is shaken in his bed because he realized the headless horseman existed and also the nearly end of the film when too many explanations about the horrid facts were given in one sequence. But the strong visual appeal of this tale which reminds the ones we used to read as children makes you effortlessly forget these weak points that also include the inhabitants' perception towards Crane. See his arrival in the village when the villagers close their shutters in front of him.Once again, Johnny Depp owes a great deal to Tim Burton to have given him a role worthy of his wide acting skills. With ""Sleepy Hollow"", the filmmaker gave us a Gothic tale for adults, teenagers which is bound to remind them of their childhood nightmares as well as a momentous work in a prestigious filmography.",Sleepy Hollow
18,Quinoa1984,One of the Best Films of the Year,8,19 November 1999,"I have just seen Sleepy Hollow and I think it is not only one of the best (and most imaginative) films of 1999, but definately Tim Burton's milestone film.  All of his past films have done alot in filmaking, but this new version of Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" had me speechless with it's dazzling acting, effects, art direction and action (not to mention an unbilled appearence by Christopher Walken.The story has Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp in a very deep acting role, as a constable from New York sent up to the superstitious town of Sleepy Hollow.  Where a ghostly figure named The Headless Horseman rides in the night be-heading people on his steed without mercy in his pursuit.  It gets better after that with a mystery unfolding in a manner only suited for Burton.Despite some story changes from the original Sleepy Hollow story by Irving (and a usual ending as such in these type of movies) it never stopped to amaze me with its good ensemble cast, dazzling set designs, and visual effects.  This deserves to be at the top of the scary films league (though as a horror film, it only makes it prudent with its head severing). A+",Sleepy Hollow
19,wes-connors,Tim Burton Gets Heads Up,8,12 September 2009,"Like it says on the DVD sleeve, ""Master storyteller Tim Burton weaves an eerie, enchanting version of this classic tale of horror. Jonny Depp is 'Ichabod Crane', an eccentric investigator determined to stop the murderous 'Headless Horseman'. Christina Ricci is 'Katrina Van Tassel', the beautiful and mysterious girl with secret ties to the supernatural terror."" Director Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" gallops very far away from the classic short story read in high school (at least the one I attended); though, the plot enhancements make it a better feature-length film. This version of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" should be taken as a completely different story. Herein, Mr. Depp plays Washington Irving's ugly Connecticut schoolmaster as an attractive, faint-hearted New York constable. He is sent to solve a series of mysterious decapitation murders in small-town ""Sleepy Hollow"". Squeamish and scientific, Depp is convinced the supernatural forces are not a factor in the crimes, but events continuously challenge his scientific belief system. Interestingly, Depp is given an appealing sidekick, Marc Pickering as ""Young Masbeth"". The film has the sense of humor welcome in horror, but often goes overbroad with one-liners and blood-splattering ""camp"". Yet, the fantastical ""Sleepy Hollow"" world created by Burton, Emmanuel Lubezki, Rick Heinrichs, Peter Young, and the production crew can't be overlooked.

20,BandSAboutMovies,Burton does a Hammer movie,7,7 December 2019,"Sleepy Hollow started with Kevin Yagher originally directing Andrew Kevin Walker's script as a low-budget slasher film. He didn't get along with Paramount, so he was demoted to prosthetic makeup and Tim Burton was brought in to direct.Ichabod Crane is played by Johnny Depp. Much like how his role in From Hell, he's attempting to bring modern science into policework while still knowing about the magic that exists in the world. His romantic partner is Christina Ricci as Katrina Van Tasse, who didn't enjoy how one-dimensional her character was.Sleepy Hollow has been the scene of numerous decapitations, which gets Crane sent from New York City to investigate. The truth involves a mercenary soldier (Christopher Walken with Ray Park doing the heavy lifting), an evil stepmother (Miranda Richardson), a witch (also Miranda Richardson) and a pact with the devil himself.This film is filled with stars from horror movies and the films of Burton. Christopher Lee is a burgomaster. Richard Griffiths plays the town's magistrate. Sir Michael John Gambon plays Katrina's father. Jeffrey Jones plays the town's religious leader. Martin Landau shows up in an uncredited role and Lisa Marie plays Ichabod's mother, who was killed for practicing witchcraft. Michael Gough, who was in Burton's Batman films, came out of retirement just to be in this movie. Oh yeah - and Casper Van Dien from Starship Troopers.The movie looks like a combination of a Hammer film and a Mexico horror movie with Mario Bava joining in. There are tons of forced perspective and limited effects shots, as Mars Attacks! was criticized for its dependence on them.Because the film was shot with such a blue cast, all of the blood was made the brightest of orange to show up on film. And everything - so it could be controlled - was shot on a soundstage.While nowhere near the majesty of its Hammer and Bava inspirations, this is a great film. I just recently returned to it and was pleasantly surprised by how well its aged.",Sleepy Hollow
21,Coventry,Myths and fairytales is a seemly Hammer-horror world!,8,22 April 2004,"(Small Spoilers) The abominable headless horseman and his horse are terrorizing a small village north of New York, near the end of the 18th century. Johnny Depp is a modern constable and his innovating techniques aren't welcome in New York. Therefore, he's sent over to the town to investigate the murders. The town is in fear and  even though Ichabod Crane tries to remain realistic  he soon faces finds out the legend it real. Yet, the cause of this reign of terror still is human hatred and diabolism and Crane slowly unwraps the intrigues and secrets the little town is filled with. The famous Horseman-legend is ideal material for gothic filmmaker Tim Burton. The screenplay that was offered him here gives him the perfect opportunity to drown the audience in a macabre surrounding, complete with fairy-tales elements such as witches who live in the woods and tree that start to bleed when cut. The portrayal of the ghoulish town reminds you of the typical Hammer Studio's way of working. A factor that isn't coincidental, since Burton himself is a big fan of these chilling gothic horror films. Burton's ingenious talent, along with the big budget results in truly magnificent scenery. The town looks ghoulish and the sequences in the dark woods are pretty haunting. Some nice special effects as well, even though the CGI is exaggerated at times. The story becomes extra compelling thanks to the good acting performances. We already knew that Johnny Depp did some of his best work while directed by Tim Burton (Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands) and the role of nervous, itchy constable suits him perfectly. Christina Ricci plays his female oppositewith blond hair for this occasion. She's a truly stunning beauty and a multi-talented actress, for sure. Ricci sounds amazingly sexy when she's saying lines like `Do you think me wicked?' Really good and worth mentioning as well are the guest appearances by Martin Landau (who portrayed an impressive Bela Lugosi in Burton's Ed Wood) and Hammer horror legend (Christopher Lee). Perhaps the best actor choice is Christopher Walken in his role of the Headless HorsemanHe doesn't say one word during the entire film, but his satanic charisma was never reflected better. Sleepy Hollow is great entertainment and one of the most professional horror movies of the nineties. Check it out in case you haven't yet!",Sleepy Hollow
22,michaelRokeefe,A headless horseman brings mystery and gore.,5,3 December 1999,"Did Washington Irving intend for this treatment of his classic story? Maybe in his nightmares! This is an ultra-violent telling of the tale about a headless horseman who rides through the countryside, chopping people's heads off at will. You get involved with the mystery that Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp)tries to unravel. At times you will be on the edge of your seat. Squirming is allowed and plenty of chances to do so. And once in a while you fight off a snicker or two. Tim Burton does his job so well. Special effects seemed real. This is probably not for small children.

It stars Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Marc Pickering, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones and Casper Van Dien. Music is scored by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki.1799 New York, and Ichabod Crane, a timid but forward thinking detective, is sent to the way out village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a number of decapitations.A perfect match of director and actor to the source material, Sleepy Hollow unfolds as a fun filled creeper of such visual and aural pleasures, it's a wonder nobody thought to put the combination together earlier than 1999. Story is familiar, though with a few changes, and although some of the comedy ends up a bit sillier than is tonally appropriate (really, Ichabod, stop pushing the effeminate angle to breaking point) , film runs along at a fair old clip and never wants for period devilment. It's never really scary when Walken's headless horseman isn't part of the scene, but it's very unlikely that Burton or Depp were aiming to soil underwear anyway. More a case of charming you whilst caressing the tingler on your spine. A case of style of substance? Yes, to a degree, but the source story still comes through the lavish eye candy painting to reveal itself proudly.Burton had created a world of Gothic mysticism, a blend of Hammer horror values and Brothers Grimm bad dreams, a land of swirling mists and tall shadows, where black, red and purple are essential colours. From the quaint duck pond in the centre of the village, to a creaky old windmill, there are visual treats galore here; which are enhanced magnificently by Elfman's foreboding rumbles. Costuming is first rate (Colleen Atwood), as is Lubezki's colour lensing and Rick Heinrich's production design. The cast are led superbly by Depp and appear to be pitching performances at just the right tone, such is the director's want. Although Ricci is sadly underused in a key role, and we could have done with more Richardson since she is wonderfully catty and yummy in equal measure. But with bona fide thespian quality in the support ranks (joining Gambon and Jones are Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid and Richard Griffiths), picture never falls short of scene enhancers.Period peril with a glint in its eye, Sleepy Hollow is a delightful nights entertainment by the fire. 8/10",Sleepy Hollow
24,Theo Robertson,Probably Burton`s Best Movie,6,4 May 2004,"This opens with a great hook , maybe not as great as some of the very best hooks seen in DOCTOR WHO  and THE X-FILES but still very effective as to pulling the audience into the story . The screenwriters have also written a very well paced script that gives a background story featuring a German mercenary during the American revolutionary war . Yes it`s a good script well directed by Tim Burton who has resisted the temptation to cover the movie in his own bizarre signature , okay he has included a couple of unnecessary ( Probably solely made to give his girl friend at the time Lisa Marie a part ) dream sequences , but there`s not much else that had me think "" Oh my god a Tim Burton film , I really must do something more interesting like watch paint dry"" as can be the case with his movies . Yes it`s stylized but not to point where it becomes unbearable and I doubt if Burton will ever make a film this good againI mentioned the script and direction but perhaps the best aspect of the movie is the cast . How many movies set in late 18th century North America have characters with North American accents ? That`s right - Far too many so it`s nice to know someone had the common sense to realise that American people of that period spoke with a sort of bastardised Anglo accent and therefore it`s logical that a bunch of British character actors were cast with the American actors adopting none American sounding accents . Johnny Depp so awful accent wise in FROM HELL has no problem with his voice here and the more I see of him the more I think that he`s not taken seriously by a large amount of critics is simply down to the fact he`s just too damned good looking . Depp will one day be remembered as one of the finest actors of his generationSo a good film . Maybe not a classic but it`s well written , well acted and well directed . Almost certainly the best film by Tim Burton",Sleepy Hollow

MIRANDA RICHARDSON is outstanding in the large supporting cast and Christina RICCI, while improbably cast as Katrina, finally convinced me that she's an appealing actress.Danny Elfman's score contributes greatly to the mood of the piece, drumming up the excitement for all the action scenes, one of which includes a mad chase in the forest with Depp clinging to the back of a horse drawn carriage while sliding on the ground on his belly.As usual, Burton gets a chance to show buckets of blood, so the faint of heart may want to turn away for the gruesome moments--and there are plenty of them.

The scenes are almost always in darkness, there's plenty of fog and some breathtaking shots of the Headless Horseman going after his victims. Other than that, the movie is hopeless. The plot is, to put it mildly, confusing; the cast is surprisingly bad (even Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci!); and the film gets very unpleasant after a while (we are almost constantly seeing somebody's head lopped off). SPOILERS AHEAD!!! The plot is the main problem--none of the characters are clearly defined, Depp is real annoying, every single female character is a witch and it's very hard to follow (looks like there were huge chunks of dialogue edited out). They do pull it all together at the end, but there are still many unexplained characters and motivations (the witch in the cave for example). EVERYONE is bad--I never thought I'd say that about Depp and Ricci, but it's true. Also the scenes of people's heads getting lopped off gets very boring after the 8th time. Visually it's incredible though, and some of the scenes are really creepy. So if you're into visuals, you'll probably like the movie. If you want plot, character or depth--stay away.",Sleepy Hollow

As heads continue to roll Ichabod investigates the case which leads him to a sinister plot involving greed, mistrust, murder, dark secrets & revenge...This American German co-production was directed by Tim Burton & is quite simply one of my favourite horror films from the past few years. The script by Andrew Kevin Walker is based on the novel 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' by Washington Irving, which I have not read so I cannot compare them, is fantastic. Everything about it works brilliantly, I love the mystery elements that develop, the character's are great especially Ichabod, there's plenty of horror & a bit of romance, it moves along like a rocket, there's some good action scenes & I just found it a pleasure to watch. Everything is balanced really well, it's obviously a fantasy film but things never get too silly. Put quite simply Sleepy Hollow is a most excellent dark Gothic fairytale horror film, it's as simple & straight forward as that. I really can't think of anything negative to say, I liked that much.Director Burton does a brilliant job as one would expect, the attention to detail is flawless, the period costumes, sets, background details & locations all combine to create a fabulous atmosphere. Sleepy Hollow feels like the kind of film Hammer would have made if they had the money. The special effects are top-notch, from the Headless Horseman himself to the various gory decapitations of which there is a plentiful supply & they must be some of the best, most realistic & gory decapitations ever put on screen, good work. There is plenty of visual flair & style plus there are lots of references to other films including a really cool homage to the original Frankenstein (1931).With a supposed budget of about $65,000,000 Sleep Hollow looks it, it's brilliantly made from the special effects to the action scenes to the overall production values. It was mostly shot in England using a strong British cast who all put in a decent shift. There's Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths, Iain McDairmid, Michael Gough & Christopher Lee. I thought Depp was great & endearing as Ichabod.Sleepy Hollow, in my opinion, is a brilliant film & to be honest I can't quite put my finger on any one specific reason. I guess that everything works so well, the mystery, the horror, the immaculate period production design, the way it's shot, the character's & the cast who bring them to life, the gore, the action & even Danny Elfman's overblown score isn't as annoying as it usually is.

When he arrives, he discovers that the murders are being attributed by the seriously superstitious residents to the ""Headless Horseman"" who has returned from hell to seek vengeance upon those who betrayed him back when the United States was fighting for it's independence. It soon emerges that there are plenty of sordid and evil goings on amongst the Van Tassels - Michael Gambon, a super Miranda Richardson and Christina Ricci and their sleazy, creepy neighbours ably depicted with some great performances from Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid and especially, though briefly, from Michael Gough. The story is cleverly layered and moves quickly, knitting the threads well and leading us down a path of jealousy, betrayal, witchery, and greed with the surroundings - an eerie, fogbound forest providing an excellent setting for this feature that is atmospheric and actually quite scary at times, too.

Not at all!The cast is impressive and full with stars like: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiarmid, Christopher Walken and many, many others. but thank God the cast isn't a celebrity overkill (such as in ""A Bridge too Far"" is the case.).

However there are some missed opportunities in the script and the conspiracy theories and when everything comes together at the ending might be a bit too much for a movie like ""Sleepy Hollow"" that should be light to watch.

33,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Full of heady goodness,8,16 August 2010,"Tim's got an undeniable knack for visuals... they'll usually be Gothic, mostly breath-taking, and always excellent. He also has a bit of a twisted side to his humor. Furthermore, he is talented in bringing colorful and well-designed creatures and characters, often of his own creation, to life. And lastly, he does atmosphere so extremely well, it's really just about beyond reproach. All of those are evident here. He takes an old and famous legend(which, I should point out, I have not read, all I know of it is what was in this, and that dull made-for-TV movie that I've also reviewed, from the same year and of the same title, save for adding ""The Legend of"" to the beginning... so I can make no comparisons or judge the accuracy of this adaptation), reinterprets it and puts together a period piece of immense enjoyment even for those not necessarily into such(I should know, I am one). The plot is interesting throughout, and develops nicely. It's not too predictable, and the twists are great. This is a rather satisfying mystery. The pacing is pretty much spot-on, this is never boring, and the action is cool and exciting... you really can not go wrong when you let Ray Park loose in front of a camera and give him someone to beat up or slash at(the choreography is masterful). This has great acting by most... putting Depp(as the squeamish and eccentric Ichabod) and Ricci(am I the only one who can just get lost in those doe-eyes?) in the same film makes perfect sense, especially under this man's direction. Even Van Dien and the children are pretty convincing. Richardson utterly steals the show, and it looks like she was as ecstatic to be in this as it is for us to watch her. The script is well-written, and the dialog is marvelous. In addition to being bleak, creepy and a stunning recreation of the look of the period(with magnificent sets and costumes), this is wacky and comical. Somehow, the tone works. Fantastic score. The FX hold up well, and are used as a tool, not the focus. A young police officer(Johnny) openly protests the horrible conditions of the justice system of 1799, and advocates science in place of imprisoning people based on pure suspicion. A judge(played by Christopher Lee, who commands the screen in his short cameo) sends him to the small town of Sleepy Hollow, under the guise that he is to capture whoever has been killing its citizens recently. What he isn't told until he gets there, is that this is no mere mortal... it is the feared headless horseman(who is built up well, and has an impact whenever we see him in this). Will he have to reconsider his stance, that everything has a natural explanation? And what, precisely, *is* going on? There is quite graphic, bloody violence and gore in this, some material is disturbing, and there is a little bit of mild sexuality and language. The DVD comes with an informational and funny commentary track by Burton, a 29 minute documentary entitled Behind the Legend(I will review it on its own page here on the site), 11 minutes of cast interviews(worth the time, note that they contain spoilers for this, as does the cast list here), a teaser and a trailer for this and finally a small photo gallery.

Depp (in a wonderfully comic affectation inflected performance) is Ichabod Crane, in this version a New York City constable instead of a school master circa 1799, who is banished to the fog enshrouded farming hamlet of Sleepy Hollow Upstate New York to investigate the ghoulish murders involving decapitation and the dark ghost story of a slain Hussein horseman out for bloodthirsty revenge beyond the grave!

36,neil-476,Kind of nearly but not quite,7,2 March 2011,"I am so terribly vexed by films like this. Washington Irving wrote a perfectly good story - look, you can see it lurking just on the other side of the doorway into Tim Burton's film. Burton has taken the location - perfectly realised - the notion of a headless horseman, the name of the character Ichabod Crane, and then refashioned everything to suit his own purposes. One now recognises that this is Burton's long standing modus filmandi - take what you want and mould it to fit your own vision.In the case of Sleepy Hollow, what results is good. Johnny Depp delivers a reliable characterisation, as usual, production design is great, the eclectic and starry supporting cast are all excellent, special effects are terrific (and frequently quite gory), and the story gallops along as speedily as Christopher Walken's eerie and genuinely creepy (usually) headless horseman.But I suspect that Washington Irving might have been a bit upset.",Sleepy Hollow

38,AlsExGal,Excels as a Gothic exercise in atmosphere and dark humor,8,21 April 2017,"Director Tim Burton's elaborate take on Washington Irving's tale of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman doesn't have much in common with Irving but excels as a Gothic exercise in atmosphere and dark humor.This rich visual feast demands a viewer's attention with its stunning photography and art direction, with countless memorably framed shots of 18th Century New York, with its foggy woods and small town cobblestone streets. Lurking about, too, of course, is the legendary Headless Horseman who seems to be collecting an increasingly large number of heads of his hapless victims.This brings about the arrival of Crane, transformed by Burton from Disney's spindly school teacher of animation fame into an analytical would be Sherlock Holmes type detective. Only this detective is decidedly squeamish about blood (not to mention spiders) and, on at least one bloody occasion, will pass out. The role is an ideal showcase for Johnny Depp, whose Crane is both darkly handsome and a bit prissy. Depp is truly endearing in his part, an engagingly idiosyncratic individual who will eventually turn reluctant hero.None of the rest of the cast, while capable, make much of an impression next to Depp. A few old timers occupy that cast, however, including Christopher Lee, Michael Gough and Martin Landau. However, Christopher Walken also appears, chillingly, in a significant role.It's a shame, of course, that Burton's skills with narrative story telling are not nearly as effective as his flair for visual dramatics (as unquestionably impressive as the latter are here) and, as far as the story itself is concerned, the film is confused and falls a bit flat. Nor are the horror elements of the story all that horrifying, though this is a film in which the decapitations by the Horseman will keep the heads a rolling. Burton largely treats these moments of bloodshed and ""terror"" as darkly humorous more than anything else.More than any of the special effects involving the Headless Horseman, what stays with me are Depp's performance and, particularly, the Gothic elegance of this production. That alone makes Sleepy Hollow well with the investment of a viewer's time.",Sleepy Hollow
39,Uriah43,Ichabod Crane vs. the Headless Horseman,5,13 September 2016,"""Ichabod Crane"" (Johnny Depp) is a police constable from New York City who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the murder of three people. Although he isn't superstitious and doesn't believe in ghosts or demons, he is surprised to find that all of the residents in Sleepy Hollow attribute the slayings to a ""headless horseman"" who appears at night and systematically selects his victims without feeling or remorse. Needless to say, being a man of science Ichabod pays little heed to their warnings and seeks out the killer with only a teenage boy named ""Young Masbath"" to help him out. Unfortunately, he is totally unprepared for what he finds. Now, rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie wasn't too bad overall. I liked the acting of Johnny Depp and I thought the director (Tim Burton) did an excellent job capturing the spooky autumn night effect so essential for this particular story. On the other hand, I wasn't especially impressed with the acting of Christina Ricci (as ""Katrina Van Tassel"") or the use of action in lieu of suspense and horror. A bit more gore might have also helped. Be that as it may, it wasn't a bad movie overall but it could have been better and I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Sleepy Hollow

Sleepy Hollow is a place that sleeps unsoundly with hopes of awakening again. Johnny Depp plays a New York constable summoned to the small village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate strange reoccurring murders.

Director Tim Burton showcases exquisite special effects that complete the film's ominous appeal. Depp combines curiosity and humour while sheltering a childhood nightmare. Christina Ricci figures into the plot in an enchanting way. Miranda Richardson steals scenes in a role that shelters secrets. Christopher Walken is featured as the Headless Horseman whose head lopping violence is repetitious but we learn of the character's background and defeat and why he slays specific persons.

41,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Entertaining modern slasher,10,28 October 2016,"After a series of strange deaths, a constable sent to the tiny town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate where he finds the townspeople claim an undead headless horseman is the culprit and that there's a sinister reason for the rampage, putting him and the rest of the town in severe danger.There was a lot of stuff to enjoy with this one. One of the film's best features is that there's an incredible look to the film which makes it incredibly fun to watch. The town here looks incredible, from being completely enveloped in darkness that gives it an eerie, claustrophobic feeling of evil surrounding everything, the muddy landscapes and weather-beaten surroundings and the woods surrounding the town add immensely to that feeling which are just incredibly spectacular and worthwhile in creating an impressive atmosphere. From the look of death on the trees to the thick, heavy fog bank that overhangs the ground constantly throughout the entire film, this adds an extra dimension to it all with it's atmosphere while even more visual prowess comes from it's locations. The different areas in the forest being represented, from the Tree of the Dead to the witch's cave and the burned out shack are just fantastic-looking places that work wonders here. The fact that the killer here manages to get a lot of good stuff about it works quite well, from the imposing appearance to the fantastic back-story to the proclivity to decapitation and the different rules about his behavior, it has a lot going for the killer here. The fact that there's a lot more action scenes here than expected is another great aspect, and really helps the movie hugely. From the first scene, where he attacks a couple on a carriage without being seen, a later scene where he is confronted by a couple of swordsmen after performing a task resulting in a rather well-done and exciting fight, the chase through the woods with the two horses and the great finale that gets the great showdown at the windmill that results in some really explosive action to the fantastic, full-on carriage chase and brawl atop it as it's moving along, this one has some fantastic action scenes and works really well. The last good plus here is the film's body count, which provides plenty of good stuff about it. This one is mostly built around tons of gags for decapitations, which mostly work well, but there's also other great deaths in here that give a fantastic body count. These here are the film's good points while there's hardly anything not to like about this one. One of it's only flaws is the fact that there's a rather convoluted and really more in-depth than required back-story here. There's a point where having too much doesn't really help a film because spelling everything out either contradicts something known previously or it seems thrown in for a twist when there's no reason to add one. This one here works so much as a film about a horseman killing townspeople in a remote village, but everything with the village elders and the secret- keeping and the twist and betrayal at the end just overly complicates the film for no reason and really could've been simplified. That, coupled with the fact that some might be put off by the fantastical elements that creep in during the finale, are the film's real flaws.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Brief Nudity and a mild sex scene.",Sleepy Hollow
42,AaronCapenBanner,Dark Legend,7,17 December 2013,"Tim Burton directed this violent adaptation of the classic Washington Irving story that stars Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, who in this version is not a schoolteacher but a New York constable(and forward thinking scientist) who is sent by his burgomaster(played by Christopher Lee) to investigate a series of brutal decapitation murders that have occurred in the New England town of Sleepy Hollow, where he is much surprised to find the cause to be a phantom headless horseman(played by Christopher Walken) who is being used in a devious plan of revenge and profit. Christina Ricci plays his love interest Katrina Van Tassel, and Miranda Richardson plays her stepmother.Gothic film has a fine cast and superb set design & art direction, and a clever script, though is marred by too many decapitations, when that should have been left more to the imagination.

The atmosphere and Burton's use of colors really enhance this movie.  I also like the change in the story, as a detective is just more interesting than a schoolteacher.  Johnny Depp is great as Crane and the rest of the cast is good as well.  There is even brief appearance by Christopher Walken and horror legend Christopher Lee.

45,Wuchakk,Great Spooky Flick for the Fall Season!,9,11 March 2014,"""Sleepy Hollow"" is Tim Burton's stylish 1999 take on Washington Irving's classic tale about Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman starring Johnny Depp as Crane and Christopher Walken as the Hessian horseman. The story is set in 1799 and involves Crane, a constable from New York City, going to the Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of gruesome murders where the victims are decapitated.Whether you like Burton's films or not, who can deny his talent for visuals and overall production? This guy knows how to make a film LOOK good, that's for sure. As for Depp, he portrays sleuth Ichabod in a very human manner, e.g. he's afraid of spiders and amusingly passes out on occasion.There are four things that really impress me about this picture besides Depp: (1) I love the spooky Fall atmosphere; it obviously takes place sometime in gloomy November. (2) I always thought the concept of the headless horseman was insipid, but ""Sleepy Hollow"" depicts him (it) in such a horrific/supernatural fashion that he's actually scary, not to mention skilled with weaponry and virtually unstoppable. I wouldn't want to run into him in a dark alley, or anywhere else for that matter! (3) Miranda Richardson was almost 41 at the time of filming, but -- man -- is she gorgeous! Nuff said. Christina Ricci also looks great and so does Claire Skinner in a small role. (4) ""Sleepy Hollow"" lacks the goofy vibe that some of Burton's films possess; the material is presented in a respectable, generally serious manner, albeit not as ultra-serious as, say, Hammer horror.Speaking of which, ""Sleepy Hollow"" strikes me as a modern Hammer film more than anything else. Perhaps that's why Burton gave Christopher Lee a cameo. Needless to say, if you love Hammer (and who doesn't?) you'll appreciate ""Sleepy Hollow.""The last half hour or so is packed with action so if your attention starts wandering, don't worry, it picks up big time. The plot's a whodunit and it gets kinda convoluted so you'll need to pay attention (or rewatch it). Not that you HAVE to because ""Sleepy Hollow"" is such a cinematic feast you can enjoy it even if the complications of the plot lose you.There's nothing else to say except to re-emphasize that ""Sleepy Hollow"" is definitely the ideal spooky flick for the autumn, or any time really.The film runs 105 minutes and was shot entirely in England with studio stuff done in Yonkers, New York.GRADE: A-/A",Sleepy Hollow
46,gradyharp,Tim Burton's Visually Stunning Masterpiece,10,3 September 2005,"As far as adaptations of old American novels go, Tim Burton's visually rich, tightly composed, resplendent version of Washington Irving's 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow' ranks in the top echelon. The script for the screen is the work of Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker and while it takes some liberties from Irving's story, the resulting dialogue and action pacing are so wholly in keeping with Burton's vision that it feels like an original story.Much of the magnificence of this film is due to the atmospheric set design by Rick Heinrichs (with art direction by Ken Court, John Dexter, and Andy Nicholson with set decoration by Peter Young) and Colleen Atwood's extraordinary costumes. It is not usual to credit these artists when reviewing a film, but their contributions are an integral part of the success of the movie.As far as acting, Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane shines in a fully nuanced character portrayal complete with paraphernalia and ticks and mild madness. He is ably supported by Christina Ricci (in one of her finest moments), and a troupe of brilliant actors that includes Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Christopher Lee, and Ian McDiarmid. They appear as though they are daguerreotypes, so perfectly in keeping with the time and period and mannerisms of Irving's novel. The musical score by Danny Elfman and cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki are synchronous with Tim Burton's brilliant direction. This is a treasure of a film. Highly recommended.

47,The_Void,Delicious pitch black atmosphere and a camp plot make this flick a winner!,9,5 October 2005,"This film is often compared to the classic Hammer Horror films, and for good reason. Aside from utilising a few of the studio's regular cast members, Tim Burton's film has the fun, innocent edge that most Hammer films enjoyed - while also putting much of the focus on the plot rather than the characters or any other finer details. Also like Hammer, the film has it's own distinct style; but instead of the bright colourful sets that Hammer so often used, Burton's film is dripping in pitch black atmosphere as thick as blood, and it is this that gives the film it's main claim to greatness. Many of Burton's films enjoy this same atmosphere, but he never used it as well as it's used here. The film feels like a dark, twisted fairytale throughout and although this can, at times, take away from the serious horror edge; there's enough blood and guts on offer to keep any horror fan happy. Props such as styled pumpkins and scarecrows help to keep this atmosphere going, and when combined with Burton's assured direction - the film is a stylish visual treat. Nearly every scene in the film is excellently staged, and shots that see things such as a beheaded mother state at her son through the floorboards show that the director has a real flair for horror.The plot follows the legend of the headless horseman. This legend hasn't been done on film many times. In fact, I can't think of a single other film that tackles it head on...although I'm not denying the existence of one. Anyway, we follow Ichabod Crane; a policeman sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of strange murders, apparently committed by a headless horseman. He doesn't believe it at first...but ""seeing is believing"", and it's not long before he's tackling the legend head on! Sleepy Hollow benefits from a plethora of great performances. Burton's frequent muse, Johnny Depp, heads the cast and he is joined by Christina Ricci, along with a whole host of great actors including Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, and Christopher Walken, who is superb in the role of the headless horseman. The nineties didn't offer much in the way of great horror films; but Sleepy Hollow is near the top of the short list. For some reason, the film doesn't have as many fans as it should; but that doesn't change the fact that it's a great achievement, and one of Tim Burton's best.",Sleepy Hollow

51,JamesHitchcock,"Inside Tim Burton's strange, nightmare, Gothic world",7,13 February 2009,"While watching ""Sleepy Hollow"" I was struck by certain similarities between Tim Burton's work and some of Terry Gilliam's films such as ""The Adventures of Baron Munchausen"" and ""The Brothers Grimm"". Both directors have a vivid visual imagination and a good eye for a striking image. Both are fascinated by myth and legend and by the clash between Classical reason and the Romantic imagination. It is noteworthy that ""Sleepy Hollow"" takes place in 1799/1800, just as the eighteenth century, the Age of Reason, is giving way to the nineteenth, the Age of Romanticism. The film is very loosely based upon Washington Irving's story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"". New York police constable Ichabod Crane is sent by his superiors to the upstate village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders in which the victims have been found decapitated. He is informed by the local people that the killings have been not been carried out by any flesh-and-blood human but by a mysterious Headless Horseman, believed to be the ghost of a Hessian soldier killed during the War of Independence. Ichabod dismisses such tales as mere superstition, as he is a rationalist with no belief in the supernatural and a great belief in modern, scientific methods of police investigation. He suspects that the village's richest citizen, Baltus van Tassel, might be behind the murders, which is unfortunate as he has fallen in love with Baltus's daughter Katrina. As his investigations continue, however, and several more killings take place, he is forced to conclude that something supernatural might be occurring, that the Headless Horseman is real and that someone might be controlling him.Despite the film's American setting, it was actually filmed in Britain, with numerous British actors such as Sir Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson and Richard Griffiths in the cast. (Like Gilliam, Burton appears to be something of an Anglophile). The strongest influences on the film were the horror films produced by Hammer Film Productions in the sixties and seventies; Christopher Lee, who starred in many of those films, has a cameo appearance here. The village of Sleepy Hollow, with its half-timbered houses, is more reminiscent of the sort of fantasy Mittel-Europa seen in Hammer films like ""Twins of Evil"" than it is of colonial America; this look may also have inspired the village seen in ""The Brothers Grimm"". The film has its weaknesses. The plot is little more than standard Hammer fare and the acting, at least in the leading roles, is not always of the highest quality. I have admired Christina Ricci in some of her other roles, such as ""The Opposite of Sex"" and ""Monster"" (a film I did not otherwise care for), but here, as Katrina, she seems too deadpan, never showing much emotion even when people, including members of her family, are killed in front of her. Johnny Depp always seemed too fey and effeminate. He stated that he always thought of Ichabod ""as a very delicate, fragile person who was maybe a little too in touch with his feminine side, like a frightened little girl"", but this characterisation makes it difficult to believe in Ichabod as a courageous action hero, which he develops into in the latter part of the film. This was the third film collaboration between Depp and Burton, but I must say that I preferred his performances in ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Ed Wood"". ""Sleepy Hollow's"" greatest strength is its distinctive visual style. Although most Hammer films were made in lurid colour, Burton apparently contemplated shooting the film in black and white. This idea was later abandoned, but the look of the finished film is almost monochromatic with a colour scheme dominated by blacks and dark greys and few bright tones other than the red of the blood. (Len Wiseman was to attempt a similar look in ""Underworld""). The idea was to give the film an eerie, otherworldly, look, and Burton succeeds well in this aim. He takes us inside a strange, nightmare Gothic world, a world of headless horsemen, of trees of the dead and of haunted windmills, a world of graphic violence leavened by a certain grim humour. It is the sort of film where style is indeed more important than substance, and style is something it has in plenty. I would not, however, rate it as highly as Burton's best films, such as ""Edward Scissorhands"" and ""Big Fish"", where he combines his distinctive visual style with material of greater substance than anything in ""Sleepy Hollow"". 7/10",Sleepy Hollow
52,Smells_Like_Cheese,Now let's not loose our heads... this was an awesome movie!,10,28 July 2002,"Tim Burton, as always you know my rant on the love I have for this director, when given a dark subject, he always does a great job with it. Everyone knows the story of the famous headless horseman of Sleepy Hollow, every Halloween, we are guaranteed to at least see the cartoon or hear the story. So one of the best known ghost stories of all time stars Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane, the famous scientist who is a non-believer until he finally faces the scary figure. Johnny was definitely a great choice as Ichabod, he brought the perfect amount of strangeness, intelligence and then you have to love that he adds Ichabod being a bit of a coward, which to be honest was very human. Then Tim just had to add the nightmarish feature of having Christopher Walken as the ghost of the headless horseman, that wasn't a pretty image.In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane is dispatched by his superiors to the Hudson Highlands hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate a series of brutal slayings in which the victims have been found beheaded. A frequent user of new, though so far unproven investigative techniques such as finger-printing and autopsies, Crane arrives in Sleepy Hollow armed with his bag of scientific tools only to be informed by the town's elders that the murderer is not of flesh and blood, rather a headless supernatural warrior from beyond the grave who rides at night on a massive black steed. Crane does not believe them and begins his own investigation, until he comes face to ""face"" with the Headless Horseman. Boarding a room at the home of the town's richest family, the Van Tassels, Crane develops an attraction to their daughter, Katrina, even as he's plagued by nightmares of his mother's horrific torture when he was a child. Delving further into the mystery with the aid of the orphaned Young Masbeth, whose father was a victim of the Horseman, Crane discovers within the Western Woods both the Horseman's entry point between this world and the beyond, the gnarled Tree of the Dead, and his grave. He finds the Horseman's skull is missing though the murders continue until Crane uncovers a murky plot revolving around revenge and land rights with the Horseman controlled by Katrina's stepmother, Lady Van Tassel, who sends the killer after her.Sleepy Hollow is sure to be a classic down the line, I loved that it's rated R, because honestly I know this is supposed to be a child's ghost story, but if it was made that way with Tim Burton as director, it would have taken away the good scares that Sleepy Hollow provides. This is a pretty bloody movie and does have some really good scares, so I'm warning you ahead of time. But there are terrific actors, great sets and this will be a fun movie to watch every Halloween. Tim Burton gives us another dark classic that teaches us how to get ""aHEAD"" in life! Lol, you never saw that coming, did you? Yeah, just watch the movie, it's a lot of fun.10/10",Sleepy Hollow
53,MovieAddict2016,"A bizarre retelling of the story that, for my tastes, is a bit too outlandish at times - but still features a great performance by Depp",6,10 August 2006,"Tim Burton is very much a ""cult"" director in the sense that he has a huge circle of fans - a lot of them having emerged onto the Internet over the years - and outside of these fans there are a lot of critics who despise him for some reason. I lean towards the circle but I'd never say I'm a fan of his, and ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a good example of why Burton still has flaws as a filmmaker. His penchant for the outlandishly dark and eccentric storytelling is visually superb - this movie LOOKS great - but the narrative is weak, and the movie is so exaggerated in places that it's hard to take seriously. I'm mainly referencing scenes such as the one inside the church when a man has a tombstone cross thrust through his heart from hundreds of feet away, and is then dragged outside across the ground of the cemetery. I mean, it's just a bit too much.Burton takes a lot of creative liberties with the story - some of which work, and others of which do not. The best aspect is Johnny Depp who turns in a brilliantly bizarre performance as Ichabod Crane, the Inspector sent to investigate recent murders only to find the place haunted by a demonic being.The twist Burton adds to this story towards the end was too much for me - I thought, like many of Burton's film endings, the finale went way over-the-top. It turns into a fairly standard cinematic action romp with the eighteenth century equivalent of a modern car race taking place on a horse buggy, and a stupid explosion inside a windmill that just screams ""HOLLYWOOD!"" I recommend this is you are a Burton or Depp fan - if not, you probably won't enjoy it much. The sets are wonderful and the performance by Depp is a highlight, but other than that, there's not a lot going on here.",Sleepy Hollow

56,OllieSuave-007,Great elaborated look at the Sleepy Hollow legend.,9,29 October 2015,"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow takes a more detailed and closer look in this Tim Burton horror flick, where Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to help solve the murders that were allegedly committed by the mysterious headless horseman. What results are an unleashing of dark secrets one after the other, and soon, it may be that the sleepy town may not be as innocent as it seems.It's a dark and eerie film with a suspenseful plot from start to finish, from the gruesome be-headings to Ichabod Crane attempting to solve the mysterious of the cursed town. The ghost intrigue builds as secrets are revealed and unpredictable moments mount, making this an entertaining and enjoyable movie throughout.The appearances of the Headless Horseman is a fantastic effect, as is the cinematography effects Sleepy Hollow, detailing the town's gloominess, dark atmosphere and turn-of-the-century look. The costumes and set designs were great; it mirrors the classic look of the 19th century.The acting was great for the most part, thought I thought some humor were forced into the story, particularly that of Johnny Depp's skirmish expressions. But, the casting director did a great job assembling such an extraordinary cast of, in addition to Depp, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and Casper Van Dien.Overall, great movie about the creepy legend - one that you can say answers all the mysteries surrounding the story.Grade A-",Sleepy Hollow
57,sddavis63,More Of A Murder Mystery Than A Horror Movie - And A Pretty Good One,7,14 March 2009,"Being totally unfamiliar with the original story by Washington Irving (all that I knew about it was the obvious fact that it featured a headless horseman) I waded into this movie with no preconceived notions and no expectations of what was going to happen. The end result was a pretty enjoyable ghost story. Johnny Depp seemed perfectly cast here as Ichabod Crane - the New York City policeman (sort of a Sherlock Holmes-type) who gets sent to the sleepy village of Sleepy Hollow in 1799 to help investigate a series of murders in which the victims' heads have been cut off and never found. It was a typical quirky sort of role for Depp, who's teamed again with director Tim Burton. Crane wades straight into the legend of a Hessian soldier beheaded during the Revolution who now haunts Sleepy Hollow until his head is returned to him. The mystery is around who he chooses to kill and why he chooses them.That mystery is pretty well put together, although a bit confusing at times, and while it does all make perfect sense in the end, I had absolutely no idea who the person responsible for the horseman's killings was going to be. I did make a guess and it turned out to be wrong. As always, Tim Burton puts together a perfect blend of story and atmosphere that makes the movie very realistic to watch, and the special effects are very well done. Although the murders are graphically depicted, they're not especially bloody considering that they feature beheadings (especially compared to, say, the bloody gore of Burton's ""Sweeney Todd,"" which also featured Depp) and I would tend to call this a murder mystery rather than a horror movie as it's suspenseful rather than frightening. Enjoyable though it was, I found there was a period in the middle when the story seemed to lose its hold on me and I had to force myself to concentrate on it, and I'm not really sure why. I also thought Crane's arrival in Sleepy Hollow - an isolated 18th century town in which most everyone is related to everyone (a point made later in the movie) was accepted a bit too nonchalantly, given that he was a complete stranger, and small towns - even today - tend to view strangers (especially city folk) with some sense of suspicion. That may be considered by some to be an unimportant detail, but I did notice it, and it caused me to question the story's credibility from the start. Still, it's a pretty good piece of work by all involved.",Sleepy Hollow
58,ThomasDrufke,Eerie Gothic Entertainment,9,25 September 2016,"Sleepy Hollow manages to impressively balance out a brutally graphic premise with an interesting mystery and decidedly timely humor. It's easily one of Tim Burton's most entertaining adventures to date.Period pieces are ripe for great horror flicks. To me, the creepiest film of 2016 has been The Witch, and that's large part due to the eerie 17th century setting on a secluded farm. Sleepy Hollow is a much more habited town, but the same eerie tone is set brilliantly by cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki. I love the way he and Burton used the town itself as a character which is a part of the mystery. Speaking of the mystery, It's nice to see Burton tackle a mystery, which I believe is the only time he's ever ventured into that genre. And he handles it well for the most part. A good portion of the film focuses on why exactly a headless horseman is taking out certain members of the Sleepy Hollow community, with Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane at the center of the investigation. Crane, in typical Burton fashion, is a bit of an eccentric and unpredictable twist to his detective style. But the real issue with some of the mystery is that the third act reveals come at a rapid pace and the story gets a little convoluted.With that said, once we get caught up as an audience, Burton gives us a juicy climatic showdown with the infamous horseman, and it doesn't disappoint. He's done a few horror films, but Sleepy Hollow ranks up there with some of his best overall features. It has his distinguished tone and style with plenty of colorful kills by one of the great horror villains of all time, the headless horseman. An awkward romance and a somewhat convoluted third act prevent it from being flawless, but it's more than just your average horror entertainment.+Lubezki+Burton hits all the right beats+Amazing climax+Well-crafted-Iffy romance-Somewhat confusing reveals9.0/10",Sleepy Hollow

I am not a fan of genre and I usually avoid horror movies but since this was based on a tale I read growing up and it starred Johnny Depp and was directed by Tim Burton, I had to see this film.This is about Ichabod Crane who is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate some murders are are believed to have been done by a headless horseman.The acting is pretty good. The supporting cast is what amazed me. It seemed like they all starred in Harry Potter in one film or another. Miranda Richardson character is pretty sinister.Overall, this is what I call a classic horror film. I would want to see this again. I rate this film 9/10.",Sleepy Hollow
60,lesleyharris30,"Not Depp or Burton's Finest, but a Good Ride,",8,17 May 2015,"Sleepy Hollow is a great movie with a very well written storyline and a really talented cast. There is a creepy atmosphere throughout and it is certainly one of Tim Burton's scariest films, they normally contained elements of horror but this film is a straight up horror, and Johnny Depp shines in the lead role as usual, further proving his versatile skills as an actor. I have come to expect a bit more from Burton, this film dosen't contain his usual trademarks and many elements that make his work so unique, it didn't feel like he put his own original spin to this, which is a significant thing for any of his films that isn't based on his own work. The build up in the film is great, it's constantly creepy and discomforting throughout as we know something big is coming, and the ending is certainly not disappointing. It's certainly not Burton or Depp's finest work, but Sleepy Hollow is still very enjoyable and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good mystery or horror. After three people are murdered by a mysterious Headless Horseman, a man must investigate these unusual killings. Best Performance: Johnny Depp",Sleepy Hollow
61,inkblot11,"A dark, repugnant, gory film.....probably Burton's worst effort, in my humble opinion",5,9 December 2007,"Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a coroner for New York City in the late 1700's. He is constantly chiding the other coroners that scientific means should determine the cause of a person's death, not what first impressions may dictate. Consequently, the others send me him to Sleepy Hollow, New York, a Dutch-heritage town in upstate New York, where three people have been decapitated. The most ghastly facts are that their heads have not been found and that a ""headless horseman"" is the one responsible for their murders. Ichabod scoffs at that idea, for he believes there must be a reasonable explanation for the murders. Of course, he is determined to bring the murderer to justice. But, once he gets to the town, he sees the horseman himself, in the act, and he is horrified. Now, four people are dead and. more importantly, how can this supernatural killer be stopped? Ichabod meets a bevy of folks to hatch some ideas, among them a beautiful, wealthy young lady named Katrina (Christina Ricci). Katrina tries to provide Ichabod with clues, even as others in town work to help him find the answers, too, for everyone lives in fear that he or she will become the next victim. Will Ichabod be able to end the killings? Now, first let me state that I believe Burton to be a great film director, as evidenced in Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, Batman, and Mars Attacks, among others. However, Hollow is dark and repugnant and, I believe, his worst film. It has an abundance of bloody scenes that are not scary, just repelling, and it has little comic relief, save for the fact that Depp faints from time to time, when things go badly. Yes, the art direction is quite good and so is the cast, including Depp, Ricci (looking very lovely), Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christopher Walken, Jeffery Jones, Lisa Marie and other talented players. Yet, even they can not rise above the film's dark themes and gory scenes, all of which leave the viewer feeling tremendously cheated out of a good tale. I do not feel it does justice to the original story and it certainly will not please any movie viewers looking for a rousing spine-tingler. The best advice I can give is, if you like the cast and/or Burton, go ahead and see what you think of the results. As for me, I am dreadfully sorry I watched the film, as its excesses are most depressing indeed.",Sleepy Hollow
62,callanvass,"Has many moments of succeeding, but like most Burton films, a mixed-bag overall.",6,10 February 2011,"(Credit IMDb) The cruse of the headless horseman is the legacy of the small town of Sleepy Hollow. Spearheaded by the eager Constable Ichabod Crane and his new world ways into the quagmire of secrets and murder, secrets once laid to rest, best forgotten and now reawakened, and he too, holding a dark secret of a past once gone.Tim Burton is an artistic Director, no doubt about that, but he often does it to the point of overkill in his movies. I remember watching this as a teenager, and being wowed by it, unfortunately that wasn't the case this time around. The creepy atmosphere is clearly apparent, and Johnny Depp's out there sort of style benefits the film immensely, but the film as a whole is very inconsistent. The whole Headless Horsemen ordeal should have been much more powerful than it was, and Christopher Walken's screen-time is precious, and not as much as I'd have liked. It tries to balance a romance (Unconvincing one I might add) a creepy horror story and a heavy Gothic atmosphere all in one, and it just isn't able to do it.Performances. Johnny Depp is better then the movie itself. His weird facial ticks, his presence, and his unique style are a treat to watch. This guy is capable of anything, and it shows here. Slight criticism, his chemistry with Christina Ricci fell flat. Christina Ricci is OK, but nothing noteworthy. She looks elegant, but her part felt vastly underwhelming. Miranda Richardson has a creepy presence, and did eerily well in her part. Michael Gambon is good, while people like Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, add some English class. Casper Van Dien is wooden in his part. Christopher Lee is sadly wasted as a Judge, while Christopher Walken could peel potatoes and look creepy doing it.Bottom line. I enjoyed bits and pieces, but the over-kill hampered the overall enjoyment for me. It's certainly worth a viewing experience, but it's not as good as the 7.5 rating indicates in my opinion. Too many inconsistencies.6 ½ /10",Sleepy Hollow

This gorgeous looking and designed period setting for the movie seems to capture the dirty, chaotic, but simple and supposedly less frantic urban life of contemporary society. The movie begins with a finely honed balanced between terrible horror and the amazing subtle Johnny Depp performance of charmingly odd and eccentricity. For the first half of the movie Depp is able to deftly insert an entertaining light, weird sense of humor among the more dark and definite nasty evil invading this quaint town. While the story teeters between science and magical horror, the second half of the movie seems to descend into a runaway riot of the fantastic that even Depp's character can't charm himself back into balance like the first half of the movie.This is a dark comedy, horror thriller that for the most part offers up sinister villains though there is something uneven and not completely convincing by the end of the movie.",Sleepy Hollow

66,slightlymad22,Depp Is Back With Burton,7,1 March 2018,"Continuing my plan to watch every Johnny Depp movie in order, I come to his last release of the decade Sleepy Hollow.Teaming up with director Tim Burton for a third time, Depp once again totally imperceptible himself in a character. He is superb. One thing I remember from 1999 was Depp not wanting Christina Ricci cast, as he had known her since she was 9 (filming Mermaids with Winina Ryder) and felt filming a love scene would have been awkward!! The scene Depp had an issue with was removed and she was cast!! I think it was a good move as she fits right in, in her second movie with Depp. The supporting cast is full of familiar faces Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths and Emperor Papatine himself Ian McDiarmid. I won't reveal who plays the headless horseman for those who have not seen it, but he is well known, it's not his first Depp movie and he was great. Burton, who jumped at the chance to make this movie after his disastrous time on Superman Lives, really knows how to set an atmosphere and he is right at home here.Depp ended the decade on a high, as Sleepy Hollow won an Oscar for Best Art Direction and was the highest grossing movie (in which he had a leading role) of Depp's career (almost doubling the gross of the previous holder Edward Scissorhands) grossing $101 million dollars at the domestic box office to end the year as the 21st highest grossing movie of 1999.

69,Dr_Coulardeau,It is so obvious he wants us to laugh with fear,9,8 October 2015,"This one is a classic, a witch and haunted classic. Since it comes from a very distant time, 1799, in 1999, to celebrate the millennium anyway after celebrating an older millennium, when everyone was expecting the end of the world and the Apocalypse, there is no need to play at ""suspending your disbelief"" because in 1799 they did believe in ghosts, in curses, in the devil, in witches and many other things like that, though deeply motivated by inheritance, property, possessions, riches, land owning, and a few other things like that. And sure enough Tim Burton does not bother to bring the old story by Washington Irving to the level of disbelief of the last year of the twentieth century. On the reverse he aggravates the case for our enjoyment. Because that is all it is, enjoyment of the living dead, the headless riding ghost, the fear and the fright of these simple people of these old days who were afraid of some sorcery, of a curse from one woman who wanted both her vengeance against a landlord and the means to capture his fortune.And this time the film is a real jewel, a gem that we enjoy sip by sip and sniff by sniff, gulp by gulp and glimpse by glimpse. Finally Mr. Tim Burton found a real Halloween story to tell us that we all knew was a Halloween story and that we could enjoy peacefully since the only objective was to enjoy our temporary pangs of fear with the riding vengeful justice ghost who will finally manage to get his vengeance and his carnal pleasure with the witch who had been able to control him because she recuperated his skull from his ostracized grave where his decapitated skull had been buried. But it took a young constable from New York playing CSI before it was ever invented, serial killers and profiling before they even were or had been heard of to sort out the truth from the fable, the ghost from the criminal, fear from reality and he was able to bring back to New York, the happy schmuck, a future wife and a valet. You will necessarily enjoy it especially since you will have to wait for the very last scene to understand the whole business, because it was business before all and above all.And you know time is business, so let's save some time, hence some money, and let me tell you, this one is a good film by Tim Burton though it has little philosophical and ethical value. Shallow but really suspenseful and maybe a little bit surprisingly frightening. The morbidity of this film is just the necessary salt, sugar and pepper to make the medicine go down.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU",Sleepy Hollow

Likewise, Tim Burton's Hammer-driven take is worth a look: it's dark, but light; scary, yet funny. The idea of Crane (Depp) as a steampunk forensics ""expert"" was sheer genius; that he's squeamish at the sight of blood was a nice touch, too, and his fainting spells make for some fun moments. Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken and every other member of the cast are perfectly cast. The music is memorable; the cinematography to die for.

This time, Ichabod Crane is a police investigator sent to the village of Sleepy Hollow (founded by Dutch immigrants) to discover a killer who cuts and collects heads. Obviously the star of this tale could only be Johnny Depp, a bizarre movie buff and an old Burton collaborator, as well as one of the most versatile and talented actors of the day. The film also features Christina Ricci (a Wednesday from ""Addams Family""), Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon and Casper Van Dien. Christopher Lee, who was the master of terror in the seventies thanks to his extraordinary voice and diction, also makes a brief but excellent appearance.The cast is extraordinarily good and does a great job. No fish bones, as we say in Portugal. It does not deserve a single negative note: the good quality of the actors and the precise direction of Burton was a combination with impeccable results. Depp is effective, can even be funny when he can; Ricci is seductive, engaging and mysterious. Miranda Richardson does a good job but the script requires that only in the end we be able to see the true value of this actress. The scenarios and ambiance, deeply Gothic, gloomy and hazy, is mysterious and scary, preparing the audience for eventual scares and giving the film the atmosphere of a horror movie when, in fact, we are in a suspense thriller. The CGI is used with caution and prudence, getting good visual effects and sound without boring or saturating the audience, as it is supposed.Not corresponding to the original story, it is however a very good film, appeals easily to the majority of the audience and is very well done.

Then, the crime story is a bit hard to follow, all the more than the names are too much alike. In addition, the original angle told at the beginning (science and reason vs lore and magic) isn't really used after.At least, it's a Burton's movie so you can find very good things as well: the sets and production are wonderful if you like new england, mist and Gothic.

All his character, the Headless Horseman, does is scream, stare at you creepily and then lop some heads off. That's it, but I'll be damned if he still wasn't the funniest, the most memorable and all around the best character in the entire film. But that's Christopher Walken for you. Only he can pull off such a feat without even making an effort.Not to say that the rest of the characters were bad or anything. Johnny Depp does a convincing job as Ichabod Crane, the rational detective sent to the countryside to investigate a mystery murder. Though I'll be honest and say that I never really saw the character. Rather I saw Depp playing his trademark quirky oddball character with slight variations. But in the case of this film, that works, so I have no complaints. The rest of the actors didn't leave any lasting impressions, but they were okay.But in all seriousness, the best part of this film, aside from Christopher Walken, is its production values. The film looks and sounds great. The costuming is topnotch, the cinematography works beautifully and all around it's a very impressive looking little film. This is a good thing, because the story itself is a bit too campy to be taken seriously, but the outlook of the film, aided by the performances of both Walken and Depp, allow you to relax early on and just enjoy the experience. I was more amused than bothered by the inconsistencies and questionable story twists, which were eventual and not as bad as they could have been.Do you require highly logical and consistent plot lines and characters to enjoy a film?

Burton showed us what sinister darkling treasures resided within himself with his initial production of ""Batman,"" and his liberal use of Gothic architecture throughout the city of Gotham. I LOVED that single installment of the Batman franchise strictly because Burton knew what to DO with the Dark Knight. Well, he knew what to do with Sleepy Hollow, as well. The performances by all involved were wonderful, the sets and designs were awesomely constructed and executed; and the direction, camera angles, shots, film quality, and even dialog were absolute perfection.Overall, this is a marvelous endeavor which I have enjoyed watching over and over.Additionally, Johnny Depp ""adopted"" Goldeneye, the one-eyed Andalusian horse who played Gunpowder, Ichabod Crane's steed, thereby saving him from the glue factory. Just thought I'd mention that. It raised my estimation of the man's character a bit, upon reading that here at IMDb.It rates a 9.2/10 from...the Fiend :.",Sleepy Hollow

85,FilmCriticLalitRao,A highly unusual film by Tim Burton,6,30 July 2009,"Sleepy Hollow is a great example of an entertaining film which takes us all back into past times where it was absolutely impossible to provide a rational explanation regarding certain obscure,occult events. This film is set in a time when murders were a common event and it was practically impossible to get hold of the criminal.It must be stated that it is a pure coincidence that this Tim Burton film shares a lot of stylistic similarities with a famous yet not so well known French film ""Un Roi Sans Divertissement"" directed by François Leterrier.It is difficult to say which of the two films is better but due to the advent of huge media publicity,it can rightly be assumed that Tim Burton's film made in 1999 appealed to more people then that of François Leterrier's film made in 1963.Sleepy Hollow would turn out to be an important film for all the admirers of Johnny Depp and Tim Burton as it will give them a good idea of how both of them prepared for their future individual endeavors ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and ""Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street"".A must for all the lovers of Jean Giono and Washington Irving",Sleepy Hollow
86,MaxBorg89,"Burton does horror, and quite well too...",9,13 February 2006,"Forget the animated Disney short. Tim Burton's first (and, to date, only) real horror movie has nothing to do with the 'toon many of us so fondly remember. It's bleak, gory, bizarre, and utterly brilliant.The main difference between the two versions is the protagonist: Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is no longer a teacher, but an eccentric inspector sent to Sleepy Hollow so that he can use his ""scientific methods"" to solve a series of appalling murders. He is firmly convinced the killer is human and everything has a rational explanation. Soon enough, though, he will realize he's facing a criminal like no other: the Headless Horseman (played by Christopher Walken in flashbacks) is not the usual murderer, and cannot be defeated with conventional weapons.Burton has successfully made this movie his own, thanks to the creepy sets, Danny Elfman's grandiose music, the grotesque and ambiguous characters (flawlessly portrayed by such actors as Michael Gambon, Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson), and Depp's freaky leading man. He has even added one of his most personal touches: the eerie flashback which shows Ichabod's childhood and justifies his behavior (see also Batman and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory for similar sequences). Without giving away the plot, it's one of Sleepy Hollow's most shocking moments.A very smart and unusual horror flick (though, as in the case of John Carpenter's Vampires, it's more gory than scary), and a must-see for Burton fans.",Sleepy Hollow

Using advanced forensic techniques, Crane believes that the task that he has been given shouldn't prove too difficult, but his world is soon turned upside down when he learns that the man that he's pursuing is not quite of this world...Sleepy Hollow is another dark and somewhat macabre offering from Tim Burton and Johnny Depp (whom have both collaborated many times together over the years). I've never read Washington Irving's novel (upon which this film was based), but was interested in this film when I read the plot summary. If I'm honest I didn't find the film to be consistently thrilling, but in fairness the basic story was fairly good and had enough about it to keep me involved (particularly in respect of the Horseman and how and why he selects his victims). Due to the very fact that everyone was a bit wacky I was never quite sure who to suspect and I found it entertaining trying to piece everything together.The screenplay is pretty good, but Director Tim Burton and star Johnny Depp are both on top form as well; having worked together on a number of occasions you do get the feeling that both men understand each other fairly well. Although the film has a dark plot and overall dark feel about it, the film does still have some amusing moments and a few gentle winks from time to time which made the film slightly more enjoyable overall.Depp gives a very impassioned performance here and does make the film a lot of fun to watch. It was interesting watching him getting swept up into the mad world of the inhabitants of Sleepy Hollow. The supporting cast all do fine with what they have to work with, but this is definitely Depp's film and he carries it well.Whilst overall the film has more hits than misses I didn't find it to be entirely successful; it does have its slow stretches (particularly in the first half of the film) and character development is quite poor, but I suppose part of Burton's problem is that he does sometimes get more swept up in the style of his products at the expense of substance. It's also fair to say that the film also suffers slightly when the headless horseman isn't around.FINAL VERDICT; Worthy of your time, but with the odd miss here and there.",Sleepy Hollow

I thought it odd that in a Dutch colonial town everyone spoke with a Brit accent (I guess Christina Ricci being younger was more Americanized), but I enjoyed seeing so many Masterpiece Theater grads, as it was shot on a London sound stage. Director Tim Burton switches from serious to camp and back, but the knowing script references defuse the gore, with a lot of tips-of-the-hat to ""The X Files,"" and Johnny Depp's coward-alternating-with-hero is refreshing, borrowing a lot more from Edgar Allen Poe, the inventor of the detective novel, than Washington Irving.I think this could give young kids nightmares.(originally written 11/21/1999)",Sleepy Hollow
91,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Sumptuous horror classic,10,7 October 2015,"-31 Days Of Horror: Day 2Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is an unapologetically gory spook fest that although has genuinely scary moments, is mostly energized by a vibe of pure rollicking fun. Even the violence is a joy to behold, as countless heads are severed and fly about the landscape all throughout the film. Burton takes a rare dip into R rated waters here, and really goes for it. It's almost a throwback to the Hammer horror films of the past (Christopher Lee even makes a nice little cameo), wearing it's influences proudly on its sleeve and thrumming with a baroque, grand old atmosphere of misty grey and earthy brown, punctuated by frequent and ample gallons of crimson blood. Johnny Depp nervously plays Inspector Ichabod Crane, a twitchy detective sent from New York to rural upstate town of Sleepy Hollow, where someone is murdering people in the night, and taking their heads. There he finds intrigue, romance, unimaginable horror, and a bunch of townspeople who are less than exactly helpful, and have secrets of their own. Legend has it that the killer is a Headless Horseman, which Crane finds to be all too true when he digs deeper. The Horseman is played by, you guessed it, a demonic Christopher Walken (there's really no other choice when you think about it) looking like something that walked out of Where The Wild Things Are. Dumbledo- I mean Michael Gambon plays the mayor, Miranda Richardson is a standout as his conniving wife. There's also fine work from Jeffrey Jones, a ghostly Michael Gough looking like he's got one foot in the grave, Martin Landau, Vernon Dursle- I mean Richard Griffiths, Caspar Van Dien, Lisa Marie and Darth Sideo- I mean Ian Mcdiarmid. Christina Ricci is a vision as Katrina Von Tassel, the mysterious mayors daughter who Crane falls for. The film is one of the most absolutely gorgeous looking pieces of work I've ever seen, every frame a breathtaking storybook frame of wonder, menace and atmospheric Gothic horror. The plot becomes more complicated than initially implied, spinning a wheel of intrigue that gives each character something fun to do. And indeed, amid the bloody chaos and suffering, the film never loses its sense of fun, allowing moments of comedy and ironic edges to the violence. Burton beckons us into the haunted house he's so painstakingly created, and he doesn't let us down. It's my favourite of his films, and one hell of a ride.",Sleepy Hollow
92,drownnnsoda,"Gruesome, Atmospheric, and Darkly Comic.",9,22 November 2006,"I saw this film a few Thanksgivings back, and I thought it was an excellent piece of cinema. After recently rewatching it, my feelings are still the same. ""Sleepy Hollow"" revolves around the quirky Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), who is sent to the small secluded village of Sleepy Hollow, New York, that is living in fear after a series of brutal slayings by a supposed supernatural figure, the Headless Horseman. An investigator and attorney, Ichabod is skeptical about the horseman. When arriving at the small colonial village, he stays with the wealthiest family in town - the Van Tassels, who have a lengthy legacy behind them. He is soon 'bewitched' by the Van Tassels daughter, Katrina (Christina Ricci), and begins to have his own experiences with the headless horseman - convincing him that the horseman is no myth, and is actually the one responsible for the series of beheadings. But there is a little more to the Horseman than the townspeople know of, and it's up to him to find out.The strongest element of this film by a long shot is the beautiful imagery. The small village, the woods surrounding it, and all the scenery is breathtaking - it looks like it came straight out of a fairytale. The village is dark and foggy, and the woods are very desolate with twisted, leaf-less trees. This sets up a very strong atmosphere, and the film takes place during the Thanksgiving/fall season, so that is another addition to film's overall feel. The special effects are also great, the supernatural Headless Horseman is very creepy, and the beheadings and deaths in the film are both convincing and grim. Everything Tim Burton does is with style, and he shows it off a lot in this movie. The plot is derived from ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving, a classic American tale. Those who are familiar with the old Disney cartoon version of the ""Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman"" will want to beware of this film, because it is much more violent and gruesome than the tame, children's cartoon, and there are some very neat spins put on the story to make it a much more dark, evil-themed film.The performances in the film are perfect - Johnny Depp plays the squeamish Ichabod with both seriousness and comedy. In fact, the film does include a lot of comic undertones and some flat-out funny scenes involving his character, that contrast with the bloody carnage that is taking place. Christina Ricci plays Katrina very well herself, she's innocent but mysterious, and has good chemistry with the Ichabod character. Behind the two leads are Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson, playing the Van Tassels, Casper Van Dien as Brom - a macho guy who is trying to woo Katrina, and Christopher Walken as the Headless horseman, in life of course. Bottom line - ""Sleepy Hollow"" is an excellent film. It's both scary and darkly comic at the same time, with a very well-written story and good performances. If you're considering seeing this film, do. If not for the story itself, the imagery and scenery are reason enough. But expect something much more grim and violent than the Disney cartoon. 9/10.",Sleepy Hollow

96,Steffi_P,"""We need to use our brains""",3,4 March 2012,"Throughout the course of the 1990s Tim Burton established himself as a cinematic brand. The audience expects certain things from a Burton movie – hallowe'en-horror stories, meek and sensitive heroes, dark and twisted imagery, and of course Johnny Depp. Sleepy Hollow contains all theses things, and was one of his most prestigious productions to date. As such, its box office success was a foregone conclusion. It's real value as a movie however is by no means guaranteed.Burton's pictures have sometimes been described as fairy tales for adults. This is all very well in itself, but does Sleepy Hollow really need to talk down to its audience so? The frequent gore and sex suggests it's not aimed at kids, but it's given the simplistic overlay of a children's film, only without the charm. One of the weakest aspects is the series of flashbacks to Ichabod's childhood, which are simultaneously boringly clichéd and too wildly hysterical to be taken seriously (not to mention the slightly disturbing fact that Lisa Marie's cleavage is continually hovering over the young Ichabod's head). With inventions like this Burton and his writers are presumably paying homage to the B-horrors of the 1960s, but really they just seem like a trashy and charmless copy of something that was endearing despite its trashiness. The dialogue meanwhile ranges from trite and insipid to frankly ignorant (1800 was not a new millennium!) Of course in movies like this atmosphere is often more important than plotting, but in Sleepy Hollow the atmosphere is laid on so thickly – and with so little imagination – that it becomes virtually meaningless. For the opening shots of a letter being sealed, the imagery could hardly be more obvious if Burton himself had popped up on screen and said ""Red wax looks a bit like blood, doesn't it, eh?"" The special effects are too cartoonish to be properly horrific, but not enough to be comical. When we see the horseman's flesh re-growing, he dips off the screen, presumably so the shot can be changed to allow for some stupid waggly tongue special effect – as if that makes any sense whatsoever.Burton was such a reputable figure by this point that he always secured big names for his casts, and if nothing else Sleepy Hollow contains some really wonderful players. Michael Gambon brings some gravity to his role, and I'm always glad to see Miranda Richardson, even if it's only that she still shows occasional flashes of ""Queenie"" from Blackadder II. But it's also a shame that so many of these excellent players don't get to show their full potential, mostly through the weakness of the screenplay or a simple lack of screen time. It seems a particular waste to have Christopher Walken in a part where he doesn't get to speak, or even really change his facial expression. But just as the supporting players are disappointingly underused, the leads are disappointing full stop. Johnny Depp was clearly trying to go for something a bit different with his fussy, slightly effeminate Ichabod Crane, but he makes for a rather dull and uninspiring hero. Meanwhile Christina Ricci's acting is only marginally better than that of the dead tree.I can't deny that Sleepy Hollow at least looks good. The beautifully stylised cinematography from Emmanuel Lubezki sometimes evokes the graininess of early cinema, at other times fills the frame with shadows while still keeping everything in clear definition. But nice as it looks, this is nothing more than high-class gloss for this dry twig of a movie. Sleepy Hollow features everything one would expect from a Burton picture, and all the lavishness that goes with a director of such renown, and yet it contains very little else of substance.",Sleepy Hollow
97,aidanratesmovies,"A Decent Effort, More Visual Fun than anything else",5,24 September 2020,"Wonderfully atmospheric, and with some great work from Burton and Depp as always, Sleepy Hollow is far from perfect, and can be dull at times, but for the most part, it proves to be as enjoyable as you would expect it to be. I enjoyed the film for what it was, but I couldn't help but feel like it could have been a lot better- especially with the promise and charm it seems to deliver at the beginning of the film. The beginning is not only charming, but quite funny at times, and it truly brings you into this collective grim world that all the characters on screen share. About halfway through, however, the film starts to loose its steam, and you begin to loose focus on why you cared about the events you are watching in the first place. It can be entertaining, but it has more than its fair share of dull moments. The cinematography is excellent and deeply gothic, but provides little more than something to look at, as the events on screen don't seem to have any great significance. Johnny Depp is fantastic in his role, and he truly brings his all as always, although the writing of his character can seem a bit repetitive at times. Christina Ricci also provides for a rather good performance, as well as a decent supporting cast, but no one besides the two truly stick out. In the end, Sleepy Hollow has its fair share of issues, but it is often a beautiful gothic work from Burton, and though it isn't always entertaining, you do always have something to keep your eye on. It isn't as good as its potential leads to believe, but through Burton's vision and Depp's performance as the lead, you are bound to have a good time more than not.

Sceptical New York police constable Ichabod Crane is sent to investigate, and is more than a little alarmed at what he uncovers ...Produced by Francis Coppola's American Zoetrope, this is a funny, scary, gleeful, atmosphere-laden gem of a horror movie from start to finish, with a fabulous cast, a terrific story and stunning direction. Christopher Lee's brief pre-credits role sets up perfectly what this is; Tim Burton's variation on an old Hammer Horror picture, complete with spooky forests, busty women, Victorian melodrama, terrible goings-on and a classic monster. It's fantastic fearful fun all the way through, with Depp's comic-sympathetic performance as the hapless yet heroic Ichabod sparking off against Burton's nightmarish photography and grand-guignol stylings. I love the way it keeps both the scares and the laughs coming without ever being self-conscious and hip, but also maintains a great mystery storyline as well. We're with Ichabod as he tries to solve the puzzle and figure out who's who, but there are no lulls in the action, with plenty of great fights and chases along the way. Everybody is terrific in this picture, especially Richardson, the quintet of old geezer conspirators, Walken (in a flashy part as the Hessian mercenary), Park (Darth Maul from The Phantom Menace) as the Headless Horseman, and an unbilled Landau as the first victim who kicks the case off. Technically, the film is near flawless, shot almost entirely on stages, with amazingly clever use of sets, effects and filters - it's almost a black-and-white film that isn't black-and-white, all greys and muted tones one minute and evocative colour the next. Emmanuel Lubezki's camera-work, Rick Heinrichs' production design, Danny Elfman's music and Nick Gillard's stuntwork are all absolutely top-notch, as is the work by co-writer, co-producer and effects supervisor Kevin Yagher. The excellent script is only loosely based on the original tale (which is largely about the countryside, vanity, food and courting rituals) in Washington Irving's 1820 collection of stories, The Sketch Book, but this is neither here nor there. Richly reminiscent of the classic horror films of both the thirties and the fifties, this is a spine-tingling modern-day grim fairy-tale to curdle the blood on a winter's night.

99,a_chinn,Underrated Tim Burton homage to 1960s Gothic horror films,9,10 December 2017,"Gnarled trees drip blood, Christoper Walken with sharpened teeth, and more decapitations than you can shake a stick at! Easily Tim Burton's grizzliest film and one of his most underrated. Burton consistently makes excellent films, but ""Sleepy Hollow"" typically isn't the first film people think of when asked what's your favorite Burton film? However, ""Sleepy Hollow"" really does deserve to be right up there as one of his best. It's deliciously bloody homage to 1960s Gothic Hammer Horror films and Italian horror pictures, ALA Mario Bava. Very loosely based upon the Washington Irving short story, this version has Ichabod Crane as a big city police detective sent into the small hamlet of Sleepy Hollow to solve a mystery surrounding a string of murders, beheadings to be precise. The film was written by Andrew Kevin Walker, the man behind the equally good, and grizzly, murder mystery ""Se7en"" and he does the same solid job of crafting a respectable who-done-it. However, just as with ""Se7en,"" this film's success is really thanks to a strong director and strong cast and less so the script. Johnny Depp plays a very smug and uptight Ichabod Crane who looks down his nose at the rubes populating Sleepy Hollow, with the exception of a blond haired Christina Ricci, who has him completely befuddled. While Crane is sophisticated and intelligent, he's completely lost when it comes to women, social interactions, and, in general, the ways of the world, which is where this film version falls in line with the Irving tale. There's also Bram Bones, the headless horseman, and a few other trappings from the original story, but for the most part, this film strikes out on it's own, but it does feature some very fun nods to the classic Disney version of the Irvings story. Besides Depp and Ricci, there's a strong supporting cast that includes Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDiarmid, Martin Landau, Ray Park doing the fighting scene for the headless horseman, Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman, and Hammer Horror veterans Michael Gough and Christopher Lee. Overall, Burton's one foray into a hard R-rated horror film is a real treat for fans of 60s Gothic horror films and more in general anyone who just wants to fun, scary, bloody good time.",Sleepy Hollow
100,Spleen,"For a bad film, very good indeed",7,28 May 2000,"It's better for a film to have good art direction than a good cast.  Not that I want to begin by complaining about the cast.  It's always a delight to lay eyes on Christina Ricci, all the old codgers of the town are very well done, and Johnny Depp is more or less tolerable role that appears to have been written with Rowan Atkinson in mind (it's a pity he wasn't available).  But a good cast can't rescue a bad script, whereas good art direction, to some degree, can.  And, to some degree, it does.  This is a gorgeous, amazingly CONSISTENT looking film.  Sleepy Hollow is not so much a town as a world.  And the woods outside, and New York itself, belong to the very same world.  There are one or two neat cinematic ideas: the two girls with the twigs, Christina Ricci's ambiguous white cloak ... actually, that's just two, but I wasn't taking notes.But, too be honest, the visual ideas aren't THAT great.  Look at this work next to a REAL masterwork of design and the difference is at once apparent. Many of Burton's images don't even justify themselves, let alone the narrative digressions they necessitate - such as the laboured, overwrought and irrelevant whodunnit.  There's a limit, after all, to how many people can die in the attempt to prevent further deaths before it all becomes just too ridiculous, and that point is passed after an hour or so, with half the village still to die.  I don't think I've ever seen so many corpses in a detective story.  Furthermore the explanation given for Ichabod's so-called obsessions is the usual kind of childhood-rooted psycho-analytical rubbish, put in because the writers read somewhere that characters need `motivation' and didn't realise that THIS kind of motivation reduces a flesh-and-blood character to the status of a simple wind-up toy.  All that guff about the poverty of reason which WE must endure because of Ichabod's childhood trauma is predicably trite.  Basically this a confused film, at war with itself in too many ways for me to tell you them all.  Let a single instance suffice. After all of Burton's effort and guile has given us a good Headless Horseman, he becomes just another guy on a horse in the chase scene towards the end.  Ichabod actually pinches his horse! and a black denizen of Hell suddenly becomes as alarming as a spare bicycle.I wasn't kidding earlier when I said that the poor script is - to a degree - rescued by art direction.  It's refreshing to see a really-well crafted fantasy world, one that isn't just our own world in disguise.  Of course it matters that what HAPPENS in this world isn't worth recounting, but strangely it doesn't matter as much as you might think.",Sleepy Hollow

Following Demi Moore's ""Scarlet Letter"" school of text adaptation, this has zero to do with the Washington Irving story, but there you go. The movie's value is mostly visual.My previous low-water mark for commentary on a DVD is either Jodie Foster's obsession with talking only about what is real and what is fake in every shot of Contact, or of course the chronically stupid ""funny"" commentary on Blood Simple, but this is right down there with them. It took me exactly six and half minutes to run out of patience with Tim Burtons inane, self-evident remarks. Between long stretches of silence he exhausts one adjective (amazing... Michael Gough is amazing, the cast is amazing, big Spanish horses are amazing...). Hey Tim, feel free to make some notes and watch it once before you you record your comments. But if he could do that, he'd be able to realize that nine out of ten of his movies have crappy scripts; Tim is quite inarticulate.I doubt anyone can top the immortal 4-word summary of this by LA Weekly's Manohla Dargis ""Sleepy and hollow indeed.""

Yea, I was a scared child. ""Sleepy Hollow"" shows, from the get go, how mysterious and cartoonish it will be. Johnny Deep, who I felt much like Jim Carrey, plays an eccentric police officer that needs to investigate the murderers in a small community, and as you can imagine, things aren't that easy. For some moments, I was capable to relate the story with some Scooby Doo's, except for the more mature version of the ""horror elements"". There is a great soundtrack that fits well in every moment it's utilized, proving that filmmakers were professional at producing it. The photography and overall directing are also GREAT, reflecting a big moment in Tim Burton's career. It's just very dark like some of his older works, like ""Batman"" and ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". The outcome is reasonable and somehow unpredictable-- at least for me and for Mr. Crane haha.

The horseman does tend to dominate much of this story as the original does.I don't feel there was much to the original fable of the Headless Horseman so pretty much any take you do on it seems fine: though maybe an Easter Bunny version would push some boundaries.This is about as weird, but more because it has to create a weird atmosphere, then add Depp doing weirder stuff than the weird people can handle, despite believing in ghosts which he all but fights with them about. Ichabod Crane being a smart, if cowardly, constable is interesting as he literally has the ""hero"" role painted on him.This is surprisingly more of a mystery than any other type of movie. The action is usually intense and brief when it happens, and much of the movie is spent looking for rational explanations until ocom's razor wins out.This is a good movie and a decent mystery, but I do feel it's just awkward in too many cases for most people to be on board.I expect Headless Horsemen and mystery fans to enjoy this though.",Sleepy Hollow

When i finally saw it, i was amazed by how Tim Burton took a beloved classic and made it darker. The casting of Johnny Depp as the main guy is worthy of an Oscar, with Helena Bonham Carter as his girlfriend. The score by Danny Elfman is well done, and the cinematography and effects are great.",Sleepy Hollow
106,lewiskendell,Burton Hollow,6,22 May 2010,"It's a tricky thing, updating these old, well-known stories for a modern audience. Stray too far from the source material, and you lose a lot of the spirit of the original work. Don't change things enough, and...well, you probably won't make very much money. Which brings us to Sleepy Hollow. A very well-known, American story. How does it fare?Well, it gets Burton-ized. Tim Burton leaves his fingerprints more heavily on some movies than others, and Sleepy Hollow is one of those movies. It only resembles the original story in name, location, and villain, and the rest is heavily influenced by...whatever the rest of Burton's work is influenced by. If you like that idea, then you'll like this movie. If you're tired of his visual style and cinematic signature, then Sleepy Hollow won't change your mind. I didn't feel like the tone really fit what Sleepy Hollow ""should be"", but that's just the result of a preference on my part, not necessarily a flaw. I can appreciate what Burton did in updating the tale of Ichobod Crane and the Headless Horsemen, but it didn't connect with me as well as I hoped. I was expecting more of a horror movie, and Sleepy Hollow isn't frightening in the least. Still, it's not bad.",Sleepy Hollow
107,screenman,Engaging Black Comedy,8,19 January 2012,"Few other than Tim Burton could have realised such grand, brooding, black comedy as 'Sleepy Hollow'. It's filmed on a sumptuous scale and positively oozes Gothic terror.This movie could be said to have 'made' Johnny Depp, who gives an excellent turn as the would-be Sherlock Holmes, a police detective dedicated to the logical evaluation of crime, only to be dispatched to the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, where everything BUT logical crime prevails. There's a hint of 'Edward Scissorhands' in some of the style and characterisation, but Burton makes this movie unique in its own right. Filming is highly evocative. There's tremendous depth of focus in some takes, when the whole world seems to be minutely observed. At other times, night and mist are used to excellent effect. Under the phantom horseman's dire spell, the village is drained of colour, there's a damp, eerie sunless gloom even to the daylight. Architecture is imaginative, set-pieces highly detailed and well chosen. Close observation is rewarded, as indeed is repeat viewing; the makers having slipped all manner of sly details that may go unnoticed first time around.I would have liked a slightly clearer development of the plot; there were moments when it seemed a bit haphazard. And the otherwise excellent theme and incidental music was occasionally too strident for my ears. But these are small enough whinges. The cast do a decent job with an adequate script. There are plenty of familiar faces, with Chris Walken as the phantom and Micheal Gambon as a conspirator.This is how Hammer should have made their vampire, werewolf & Frankenstein movies, Though neither the imagination, creativity or budgets were available in those days.Engaging, unique and well worth a watch, though lacking that essential WOW factor.",Sleepy Hollow
108,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Sleepy Hollow""- Tim Burton's take on the classic story is a fiendish, frightening... and hilarious riff on an iconic tale!",9,2 August 2017,"Inspired by the Hammer films of old and hyper-stylish storytellers including Mario Bava, Tim Burton's 1999 release ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a successful and enthralling reinterpretation of Washington Irving's classic short-story that blends Gothic horror and slapstick comedy to an expert degree. From a script by makeup effects maestro Kevin Yagher and the delightfully twisted Andrew Kevin Walker, Burton's film aims high at bringing a tale everyone knows into the modern world of filmmaking, and it's an absolute blast from start to finish. With nonstop action and intrigue, moody and awe-inspiring atmospheric direction and a charming cast of characters who supply plenty of belly- laughs from start-to-finish, ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a wonderful film that continues to win over audiences to this very day, nearly twenty years after its initial release.Burton regular Johnny Depp stars as Ichabod Crane, a New York City police constable whose ""modern"" methods of scientific reasoning and deduction don't sit well with his by-the-books, old-school superiors. Ultimately tasked to prove that his cutting-edge ideas work, Crane is dispatched to the small village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a troubling series of murders- a number of the town's residents have been slain, their heads removed from their bodies. Upon arrival, Crane is informed by the spooked and superstitious townsfolk that there is already a suspect- a devilish, spectral figured called the ""Headless Horseman"", whom has returned from Hell to claim more victims. Ichabod soon enough learns that despite his initial hesitance, the townsfolk are correct and he is dealing with a supernatural threat from beyond the grave. And thus, he must piece together the mystery of why this demented ghost of the past has only now returned to the world of the living...In many ways, you could call ""Sleepy Hollow"" the perfect Tim Burton vehicle, and it reflects and relishes in the mastermind filmmaker's various likes and eccentricities in virtually every moment. Burton has always been a beloved and yet somewhat polarizing figure in the world of film, as he has a distinct and definite style and methodology that either speaks too audiences or leaves them feeling somewhat alienated. His leaning on moody, dark and mind-warping Gothic visuals and sharp design, in addition to strong archetypal characters are a major strength in his many films, and give his movies a feeling all their own. And I think its a perfect fit for this particular story. His ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a world that seems to exist all on its own, and it helps to ground the film in its own sort-of delightful, fairy-tale eseque atmosphere. I also very much appreciated the visual contrast he injects into many scenes, which gives the film a dream like (or even nightmarish) quality. And yet, he's clever enough to know never to go too far into the world of the strange and devious, and makes sure to punctuate almost every scene with a sharp visual gag or character-centric joke to lighten the mood.The cast of remarkable performers Burton has assembled also do great justice to the material and help to drive the film forward. Depp, a friend and regular collaborator with Burton, is just fantastic in his role as the brilliant but sometimes cowardly and bumbling constable Crane. He is clearly having a complete and utter blast, and the feeling is contagious. His take on Crane is endlessly likable and endearing, even though he's far from being a perfect man. Christina Ricci is also a great deal of fun, portraying young Katrina Van Tassel, whom joins in with Ichabod in his investigation. While her role can feel somewhat underwritten and she's more-or-less there to provide a romantic interest, she does a very good job and adds much to the proceedings by being the ""heart"" of the film. A small army of veteran character actors round out the townsfolk quite well, including Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson as the elder Van Tassel's, Richard Griffiths as a troubled Magistrate and Ian McDiarmid as the town's local doctor. They add a sense of class and realism to the proceedings that came very much appreciated. We even get a small but memorable turn from the brilliant Michael Gough as the town notary, which was a fun callback to his role in Burton's prior work on the ""Batman"" franchise. And then there's Christopher Walken, whom plays the role of the Headless Horseman in a key flashback scene early on. I won't spoil it, but fans of the actor are going to love seeing him here.I would also like to take a moment to discuss the continued collaboration between Burton and his longtime composer, Danny Elfman. While Elfman is now mostly recognized for his work on big, bombastic superhero-movie scores, a lot of his earlier compositions with Burton go under-appreciated, and I do think that ""Sleepy Hollow"" is among his most underrated work. The score for the film is just outstanding, and compliments every scene and moment fabulously. It's so deliciously moody and eerie, with a great, Gothic theme for the town and sinister background vocals in key sequences. It's just a phenomenal piece of work, and it's a shame the score doesn't get more love. It's perfect Halloween-time music.In the end, Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" continues to excel and entertain, delivering a spooky but very fun ride that could be appreciated by all ages, were it not for the large volume of gore that probably makes it a bit too harsh for younger children. The characters are endearing. The mystery genuinely interesting. And the keen mixture of horror and comedy handled exceptionally. It's another masterpiece from its talented and beloved director, and it's one of my favorite go-to's for the Halloween season. Sure, there are some minor squabbles I have with the film, and they do hold it just shy of perfection for me... but the fact remains- this is a great, fun film. And I give it a fantastic 9 out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow
109,Luigi Di Pilla,Creepy Hollow,4,28 February 2005,The first time I saw it some years ago on DVD I thought oh this one I have to see again but after I have seen it again it was boring. I mean it's not a story where I can say this is one of those I will keep in my collection cause here you see and that's it. It's definitely not a must see but if you like horror visual effects this is for you. There were many bloody and violent scenes with rolling heads. I have to admit that the setting place was wonderfully built and created so the needed mysterious atmosphere. The special effects were real good especially the horse scenes with the rider and the soundtrack from Danny Elfmann was as usual great. The running time of the movie is just okay. I think this legend is more interesting to read in the book than to be translated in a creepy horror show. That's perhaps why there was no place for suspense and thrilling moments and this should be for me the most important elements for a big successful ride. For these reasons it deserves not more than 4/10. Too overrated on IMDb.,Sleepy Hollow
110,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Not one of Johnny Depp's better works,2,21 September 2014,"Don't get me wrong, Johnny Depp was amazing in Edward Scissorhands. Sleepy Hollow however was certainly not his best acting job, nor was it a very good movie. I'll likely get a lot of 'unhelpful' votes on this review, but here's my opinion: Basically it follows the classic story of schoolteacher Ichabod Crane, but in this version directed by Tim Burton he's a police officer sent out to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate murders done by a mysterious headless phantom. He falls for Katrina, who is played by the actress who was Wednesday in The Addams Family movies.Ichabod Crane, throughout the film, is hard to take seriously at the best of times. He is kind of a wimp and all through the movie I just kept thinking, ""okay, the fainting thing is a little old now!"" With his Gothic look, nearly inaudible voice (I had to keep adjusting the sound on my television to hear him) and strange gadgets, it's extremely hard to take the movie seriously at all. The film was incredibly boring; the scenery was just a bunch of trees and 1800's-style houses, nothing to make it stand out. Aside from Christina Ricci, the acting was pretty bad. The soundtrack was boring and unmemorable.Johnny Depp is definitely one of the best actors I've seen. The problem is, he's in nearly every Tim Burton film, and he always looks about the same, sounds the same, and it's hard to think of his roles as each a separate character in each film.I wouldn't recommend Sleepy Hollow unless you're a Johnny Depp fan. If you want to see better Tim Burton films, try Batman (1989), Edward Scissorhands (1989) or Beetlejuice (1988).",Sleepy Hollow
111,sme_no_densetsu,Unmistakably a Tim Burton film but not one of his best,7,4 February 2020,"These days, there aren't a lot of directors working in Hollywood that have a style all their own. Tim Burton is definitely one of them. His brand of quirky, often gothic-inspired filmmaking is ideally suited for a property like ""Sleepy Hollow"" with its legendary headless horseman.Based on Washington Irving's classic short story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", this movie adaptation definitely falls into the category of 'loosely based on'. The iconic Ichabod Crane is here in the form of Johnny Depp but instead of a schoolmaster he's a police constable dispatched from the big city in order to investigate a series of decapitations. I think this was a step in the right direction in refashioning the story for a modern audience. Depp's Crane is still a less than heroic character but his futuristic (at the time) methods of detection make him a more palatable protagonist. However, I think that the script goes too far with the mystery angle by presenting us with an altogether too convoluted plot.Luckily, a fine cast was put in place to prevent the movie from completely losing its audience. As always, Tim Burton brings out the best in Johnny Depp and here he has no problem carrying the movie. Christina Ricci, on the other hand, seems miscast and fails to leave much of an impression. Instead, it's the fine supporting cast that stands out with the likes of Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths, Jeffrey Jones & Michael Gough all contributing greatly to the film's atmosphere.Speaking of atmosphere, this movie is shrouded in a rich gothic atmosphere from beginning to end. The Oscar-winning art direction is exquisite, as are the Oscar-nominated costumes & cinematography. Add in a score by Danny Elfman and you've got a movie that unmistakably bears the imprint of Tim Burton. The only complaint I have is that some of the special effects are a bit cheesy, which may have been intentional.""Sleepy Hollow"" is a movie that does a lot of things right but its effectiveness is crippled by a meandering story that fails to keep you on the edge of your seat. As a horror movie it's fairly tame (despite all of the decapitations) and as a mystery it's not really that satisfying. It's definitely worth watching for fans of Tim Burton but it fails to wring all that it could have out of Washington Irving's template.",Sleepy Hollow

113,Screen_Blitz,"Visually arresting dark tale is gory, but a clever piece by Tim Burton",7,3 August 2016,"Embracing a dark, quirky vision and engaging characters from Washington Irving's novel 'The Legend of The Sleepy Hollow', this film sees Johnny Depp collaborating with director Tim Burton for another fantasy adventure, but with more blood and gore and less kid- friendly material than most of Burton's. With Burton taking place in the director's chair, it is only anticipated that the director captures his trademark macabre storytelling and Gothic visual atmosphere, take a look back at Burton's 'A Nightmare Before Christmas' for an example. As expected, this film embraces it beautifully, if a bit creepy. So the movie takes place in near the dawn of the 18th century where we witness a wealthy farmer, his son, and a widowed woman as they riding on a stagecoach in the middle of a dark field when they suddenly beheaded by the Headless Horseman (played by Christopher Walken). A New York City constable Ichabod Crane (played by Johnny Depp) is appointed by the government to travel out an old town of Sleep Hollows to investigate the grisly murders and bring the headless slayer to justice. Upon his investigation, he meets Katrina Can Vassel (played by Christina Ricci), the daughter of the wealthy townsman Baltas Van Tassel (played by Michael Gambon) who he gradually falls in love with. As the body count in the old town continues to rise, Ichabod is accompanied by Katrina and Masbath (played by Marc Pickering) to put an end to the Headless horseman's tyranny.This Tim Burton fantasy picture is with zero doubt creepy in both the visual and narrative department, not to mention quite gory as decapitations occur more often than a slasher flick by Wes Craven. Calling this a slasher movie set in the Victorian Age however, does a feel somewhat of an overstatement as this film's main element is visuals and storytelling than a plot of individuals getting picked off one by one. Nonetheless, there are definitely some scares to endure here as we experience some of Tim Burton's dark, creep trademark imagery, one of which includes a living tree filled with severed heads from the Headless Horseman's slayings. The visuals suite the story quite well and make up for the story's eerie atmosphere. The costume design and makeup, particularly done on Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane is dazzling and captures an accurate feel of the Victorian Age setting. The character development is fine, though the manner in which they are written give them a feel of more like caricatures than lively characters. Then again, this is Tim Burton we are talking about, and the slight quirkiness of the characters only deliver an appropriate feel for a Tim Burton picture. As Johnny Depp's Ichabod Crane and Christina Ricci's character develop a relationship, we experience a romance that feels pretty weak than realistic. As a result, it is hard to buy into these two falling in alive, especially considering the heavy age gap between the actor and actress. Overall, the film's engaging, solidly paced storytelling make up for the flaws, with plenty of surprises and twists to experience. Sleepy Hollow is a visually arresting work of art by Tim Burton, one that is definitely worth checking out, but perhaps not for non-Tim Burton fans. This movie may plague with nightmarish imagery and gruesome violence, but it is done a genuine manner that never feels gratuitous or exploitative. In the end, Tim Burton's macabre storytelling, characters, and artistic visual aspect are certainly worth admiration.",Sleepy Hollow
114,pyrocitor,Keep your head on,8,24 August 2005,"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow and the Headless Horseman is a timeless one; everyone knows it. So how better to re-tell this story in an interesting and innovative fashion which will appeal to today's audiences than to hire quirky filmmaker Tim Burton, whose eccentric sets and expertise at mood building are a fair guarantee that the film will be interesting, if nothing else. Burton lives up to his reputation here; Sleepy Hollow may prove to be his most atmospheric film yet. The sets of the town Sleepy Hollow are marvelously strange, (and very Burton-esq for any fans) perfectly capturing the feel of this shady, timewarped town. There's also a constant feel that something isn't right, as if dark forces could strike out at any moment. (aided by Danny Elfman's triumphant score, which I enjoyed, but found too intrusive at times: when the tension should have been built slowly and sickeningly to draw the viewer in further, Elfman sometimes brings it to a crashing climax far too quickly) It helps of course, that the village residents have the grizzled look of having stepped out of a child's fairy tale book, especially Burton favorite Michael Gough, Richard Griffiths, Ian McDarmid and Jeffrey Jones as some of the town elders. Burton even manages to sneak in a brief role from another favorite of his, Christopher Lee, who manages to be typically imposing and commanding, standing out even though he was in only a single short scene.Of course, Johnny Depp is always a pleasure to watch, and he manages to make the role of Ichabod Crane his own, filled with twitchy mannerisms and girlish squeaks. Crane may not be the typical action hero, but he is delightfully personified, and just quirky enough to work. Christina Ricci also gives a strong performance as Katrina Van Tassel, daughter of Baltus (Michael Gambon) and Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson) unofficial leaders of the town. Katrina appears to be the only innocent and pure character, yet with some undisclosed dark secrets of her own. Ricci pulls off the character believably, though she struggles with her accent at times. However it is great to see such classy actors as Gambon and Richardson as the mysterious unofficial magistrates. Both turn out excellent and dignified performances, though both graze the line of going over the top during some of the more dramatic scenes. Even Casper Van Dien gives a satisfying performance as a highly suspicious village resident. And of course, it's great to see Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman during a flashback sequence with his head on - Walken proves that he is truly one of the greatest actors still around as he manages to make his role utterly terrifying without speaking a single word. (although to be fair, his makeup does help add to the effect, but it's easy to believe he could have been equally frightening without it) The strong performances from the cast help the film hold strong during some of the weaker sequences, and really help make the film a success. Although, another major draw will be Burton's unique and creative set design and trait for really giving the sense of immersing the audience into a complete other world. If you are willing to forgive the occasional weak plot point, Sleepy Hollow is an excellent way to spend an evening, immersing yourself into Burton's dark world and profound imagination. This truly does seem to be the movie he was born to make.-8/10",Sleepy Hollow
115,oneguyrambling,"Tim Burton's finest pasty skinned, overblown, Gothic moment.",8,20 April 2012,"I only realised that since Beetlejuice in 1988 I have seen every single full length film Tim Burton has made, but scrolling down the IMDb page today I can't say that aside from this film I found any of them especially memorable.Granted Burton has undeniable visual flair and his movies POP out of the screen, also inarguable is his willingness to experiment and try new things, I mean who else has a musical, a big budget comic book adaptation, and stop motion animation films on their resume. So while I've admired his output and will continue to check out his films he has never made anything that resonated with me like Sleepy Hollow does – and besides some of the more obvious reasons I can't explain why I like it so much When Constable Icabod Crane (Burton muse Johnny Depp) is reposted (but really shuffled out of the way) to use his advanced investigation and new fangled means in detection to ascertain why the average height of the locals is reducing he obeys only as it is his duty.Upon arriving in the small town and meeting with the locals he is sat down and sombrely informed that the 3 recent victims who no longer have use for nice hats were allegedly abbreviated by a serial killer who is similarly headless, only this one rides an undead steed and tops his victims with swords, axes and scythes. The Horseman is essentially dead, so bullets and swords do little damage, he also looks a lot like Christopher Walken (in a wicked cameo) when his bonce is perched on the shoulders, and his teeth are filed into fangs for a more imposing and unnerving appearance.Now Icabod is above all a creature of logic and reasoning and all this sounds too far fetched, so his takes his Lil Sherlock bag filled with self made tools and looks into things, vowing science and analysis will do the trick.When his initial findings bring up little of substance Icabod turns to the locals and commences questioning those that might know, it seems that everyone in the quiet town has secrets and everyone is somehow related in some way by blood or marriage, but ultimately like the recently deceased he comes up short.The more senior town officials – namely the men who requested police assistance in the first place – are particularly cagy and there is much muttering and conspiring behind closed doors.Icabod is quartered in the loft of a well-to-do farmer Baltus Van Tassell and his wife Lady Van Tassell and daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci). Icabod and Katrina have a spark between them, (which seems logical, after all one is 21 Jump St and the other the only young chick in town and also someone who wears a dress so tight her cleavage is up around her ears!).When still another victim is taken Icabod takes on the newly orphaned son as his apprentice and dogsbody – and the two continue the case, often with young Katrina alongside.Before I cut descriptions of the plot short – so to speak – I must say that at one point Icabod indeed learns that the Headless Horseman is not only possible but he is perpetrating the crimes – though possibly with the guidance of others.Through the remainder of this excellent film Icabod is given cryptic messages and gradually his investigation and interpretation leads him to the truth which involves witchcraft and deeply buried local secrets.He not only discovers where the Headless Horseman ""resides"" but how he came to be in his current state, and more importantly how he selects his next victims.I believe that Sleepy Hollow was predominantly shot on one massive sound stage, which is amazing considering just how many scenes occur outdoors, including horse-and-buggy chases.The sets and costumes are all grayish and pale and the countryside forever coated in light mist – is that why Johnny Depp has such flawless skin? – all the better to highlight the garish unnatural looking red of the blood that frequently spurts and gushes, often onto Icabod himself.Being a Tim Burton film there are constant Gothic touches, odd imagery and the afore-mentioned blood, this is undoubtedly his most violent film too (Sweeney Todd is runner-up), aside from the frequent and graphic decapitations citizens are impaled and severed in half.As I mentioned earlier Sleepy Hollow has all the base elements that make up a Tim Burton film so we know it will at least be interesting and a visual treat, but Sleepy Hollow goes a couple steps beyond the normal Burton effort, as well as the everpresent Johnny Depp, the formal sounding dialogue, the amazing visuals and the attention to detail this one has a reasonably effective plot even with an undead assassin and witchery.It is the story that often gets set aside in Burton's flicks to make room for more odd antics and intricate visuals, Sleepy Hollow though has a plot that keeps you interested in more than what you are seeing, so even if this looked banal and flat it would still be worth watching – the fact that the story is aligned with a Burton production elevates Sleepy Hollow above all other Tim Burton efforts.Final Rating – 8.5 / 10. The stars finally align for Tim Burton, at last a film that looks great but is backed up by performances and plot comparable to the backdrop.",Sleepy Hollow

Sleepy hollow is a scary film that doesn't even care if it breaks rules. For instance, children in this film are murdered. Now how often do you see that in a horror film? Not often because Burton isn't like any other film director. He has no horror film rules. He does it the way he wants it. That is the way a lot of directors do it. Sleepy hollow is loosely based on Washington Irving's story. I can't remember the name cause it's very long. Icabod Crane(Played by Johnny Depp) is sent down to the town of Sleepy hollow to investigate a few murders. He soon finds out that there are from a guy named the Headless horseman. It's pretty obvious why they call him that. Soon enough Icabod finds out some shocking facts. Some of the stuff being sexual. Other stuff, well, betrayal.Burton has taken a short classic and turned it into something scary. The film has it's share in blood. Lots and lots of blood. Sleepy hollow is a creative movie. With a lot of twists. I left out a character. Katrina Van Tassel(played by Christina Ricci) is the love interest. There are a lot of other celebs. Like Christopher Walken as the Headless horseman. This film is very creative. Filled with a few unexpected twists involved. I love horror films like this because I am, sure I would run from this guy.

119,bobsgrock,Pure Tim Burton.,7,21 June 2008,"Sleepy Hollow is visually stunning, filled with great sets and a perfect mood to capture the horror and creepiness of the situation. Tim Burton is a master of this genre, and he uses his skills with special effects to give some really effective scenes involving the Headless Horseman chasing down people and taking their heads. What is different about Washington Irving's legend is the story. Burton takes the famed character Ichabod Crane, and turns him from a gangly, unsightly school teacher to a mild-mannered, handsome constable who wants to use modern-day techniques to discover murderers and cause of death. Johnny Depp is very good, as usual, playing Crane as a smart intellectual who sometimes lets his fears and emotions get in the way of his work. Christina Ricci is good as well, but looks to be about only 12 here. What doesn't work here, like many of Burton's films, is the story. The opening quarter is very scary and suspenseful and pulls you right in. The last fifteen minutes or so really drop off and don't really take the audience any further. I was expecting a bigger twist here, since this is done by the man who wrote Se7ven. Still, this is a scary thrill-ride that feeds the emotions but not the brain. If only Burton would start doing that, he might be one of the best in Hollywood instead of one of the better.",Sleepy Hollow
120,baumer,A wonderfully atmospheric film,7,28 December 1999,"I have never seen some of the so-called classics that The Hammer films produced, nor have I seen many of the classic horror films that Lugosi and Lee and Price have made.  But from what I have read and heard, those films were very atmospheric and had many shots of murky graveyards, dark streets with only dimly lit lights and monsters that seemed unstoppable to the average human being.  And it may be true that it has been about 40 years since those kinds of films graced our screens, but I think Tim Burton has produced a film that is a throw back to those types of films.  I have never been a huge fan of Burton's work but I must say that this film is as atmospheric and entertaining as I could imagine it to be.What makes this film so well done is the fact that the time frame allows for many of the abnormal shots and situations.  The year is 1899 and this is before electricity and cars and automatic weapons.  This is a time when light is shed by candle, people get around on horses and the weapon of choice for most is still the sword.  Thus the possibilities are endless with what you can do.  Tim Burton wisely gives us much to marvel at.  The opening sequence that has one of the townfolk decapitated is so well done that you are almost afraid that the rest of the film can't possibly follow in the footsteps of the brilliant first ten minutes.  But it does and it does it consistently.  There are many scenes with dense fog and dark nights, and that is the real strength of the film.The film also contains some rather humorous parts with Depp, as Ichabod Crane, using his new scientific methods of detective work much to the awe and sometimes chagrin of the town folk.  In one rather funny scene, Crane arrives at the scene of a decapitated body.  He inspects it and as he does so, he knows the body has been moved.  ""Have you moved the body?"" he asks the confused man.  ""Yes, I did."" he replies.  ""You should never move the body at the scene of a murder."" Crane tells him angrily.  And then with a confused tone and bewildered eyes, the man responds, ""Why not?""  And then Crane pauses for a minute and then says hesitantly, ""Because, you just shouldn't.""  It is a perfect scene.  Crane is just discovering many of his scientific theories and he knows that you shouldn't do something but not really why.  His confusion is humorous to us, the audience and many other scenes are played for laughs in the same way.But let's face it, we didn't go to this film to be humoured, we went to be at least mildly frightened.  And I have to say that fright was not something that I experienced watching the film.  The headless horseman is a vicious villian and he is relentless in his pursuit of heads, but he is not really scary.  That is not to say that the film is poor because of this, it is just to say that scares are few and far between in the film.  The rest of the experience is a positive one and I honestly have to say that the decapitation scenes are a wonder.  I understand that they can do much with computer animation now, but the cut from live action to computer animation is so subtle that you cannot even remotely tell what is real and what is a CGI.  Similarily, if anyone remembers the first Friday the 13th film when Kevin Bacon dies, he gets a spear through the throat and they had to do that by cutting from one angle to the next and then put   a replica of his body under the covers.  As the spear came through the bedsprings and the mattress and into his throat it had the appearance that it was really going through his body when in reality his head was nowhere near the fake body.  They then added some coloured chocolate syrup to make it look real.  But you can tell that there was a deliberate cut in angles to complete the affect.  In Sleepy Hollow there is no change in camera angles, it really is quite impressive.Sleepy Hollow is a fun film, it is not great but it is worth the ten dollars that you will spend at the theater to watch it.  Christopher Walken is priceless as the Horseman and even though he has no spoken dialogue he is one of the more entertaining actors and charcters in the film.  Depp is good and so is Ricci.  Principal Ed Rooney is also quite good in his small role. And some of the British actors are perfect in creating the atmosphere that you need to pull a film off like this.  One in particular I think I recognize from Robin Hood Prince of Thieves, he was Duncan, the man who gets his eyes removed.  At least he looks like the same actor. 
All around, this is a good film and anyone who likes atmosphere will surely enjoy it.  It is also nice to see Francis Coppola in the producers chair again.7 out of 10",Sleepy Hollow
121,DunnDeeDaGreat,Great telling of a classic story,8,16 June 2003,Wonder boy Tim Burton made a great telling of a classic tale in the form of Sleepy Hollow. The film which features dark cinematography and great special effects is highlighted by Johnny Deep and Christina Ricci's performances. Christopher Walken who just has to look at you to be scary is great as the Headless Horsemen. All in all a great film.,Sleepy Hollow
122,PatrynXX,Oh my. What fun is this?,9,1 June 2000,"Classic Tim Burton.  From the same dude who brought us beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands... Comes this fine little dandy.  I'd wanted to see this movie when it came out, but it ran into a little 007 trouble.  I'll always watch James Bond before anyone else even if Bond's quality rating could be more or less of this movie.  I pretty much loved this movie.  Christina Ricci was fun to watch in this movie.  I would consider this movie one of her best.  Johnny Depp is strange as usual.  He so looked his Edward Scissorhands best.  Some of the whigs in here are recognizable, and totally fun.  This was also classic Christopher Walken.  He was born to play roles like this.  It wouldn't be a horrific movie without him. ---POSSIBLE Spoilers:::::
Some points I didn't like was the very end of the movie.  I would have thought just cutting it after he faints woulda been fun.  Or ending the movie at sleepy hollow somewhere would have been fun.  As always, it's always tricky after changing the ending of a classic (ie The Scarlet Letter (demi moore)... which actually I didn't mind that change.  however The Crucible (Winona Ryder) didn't change the ending and it also did a good job.)I also thought having some idiot placing that idiotic flaming pumpkin scene was unnessessary.  Why have it?  It wasn't pertenent to the story.  I haven't ever read the book, but I just thought it distracting.I give this a 7 out of 10.  But very entertaining it was.",Sleepy Hollow
123,emasterslake,Tim Burton's most Violent/Dark movie ever.,8,1 June 2006,"This is based off of the famous American tale of Sleepy Hollow. Which is know to be the first American Fairytale. Only this is different from the story you know by heart.In this version Ichabald Crane is a New York investigator not a school teacher who uses surgery tools to solve how a person dies. He's given an assignment on the murders that occurred in the town of Sleepy Hollow.When he was there he learned from the locals that the murders are done by the Headless Horseman. Who was originally a violent Hessian who killed many American Troops during the Revolutionary Era of America. He himself eventually got killed when his own head chopped off.And it is believed that the ghost of that Hessian aka the headless Horseman comes back from the dead and kill innocent people till he finds his head.Ichabald who isn't superstitious finds it impossible for that to be true. And tries to convince them that the killings are done by a murder.But as the plot goes along, Ichabald will soon learn that these killings are more than just a ghost story. And the mystery behind it all is very unpredictable.I have to admit I did like this movie a lot. I wouldn't of been able to seen it back in 1999 cause I was still a kid back then. But I think it was well done even if it's different from the original story. It's the only R rated movie Tim Burton has done so far.it also has plenty of celebrates like Johnny Depp as Ichabald, Christopher Lee, Ian McDiamard, 2 actors from Harry Potter films, and 2 actors from Tim Burton's BatMan Returns.A must see for the die hard Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fans. Just be sure you're mature enough to see an R rated movie. Cause this movie has a lot of violence in it.",Sleepy Hollow
124,Beta_Gallinger,"With dark visuals, impressive acting, and loads of tension, this Tim Burton movie is a stunner for the most part!",9,11 December 2009,"I was first introduced to ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving at a very early age, when I started hearing an audio book version of it. Not long after that, I saw the short animated Disney adaptation of the story. I remember both hearing the audio book and watching the Disney cartoon several times as a kid, it must have been in the early 90's, so I had been familiar with the story for years by the time this adaptation from Tim Burton was released in 1999. However, for some reason, it took me ten years to get around to watching the whole film (I saw just a bit of it years ago), even though I've seen every other Tim Burton film with Johnny Depp. I was expecting ""Sleepy Hollow"" to be a good movie, and my expectations may have been slightly surpassed! In 1799, there has recently been more than one mysterious murder in the American town of Sleepy Hollow, and the bodies of the victims have all been found with their heads missing! A police constable named Ichabod Crane is sent from New York City to investigate, and soon after arriving in Sleepy Hollow, he is told of the Headless Horseman, the ghost of a Hessian mercenary sent during the American Revolutionary War who was caught and beheaded with his own sword! It is believed that he is the one responsible for these murders, but Ichabod doesn't believe this, and begins his investigation believing the murderer is a ""man of flesh and blood."" The constable is boarded in the home of the wealthy Van Tassels, and quickly falls in love with the family's daughter, Katrina. As he continues to investigate, he eventually sees the Headless Horseman himself, and learns that the story is true! One of the things that make this film great is Burton's dark visual style, added to the scenery, full of leafless trees. These visuals are amazing and really fit the haunting atmosphere of this horror movie! The acting here also helps the quality of the film, as Depp puts on a noteworthy performance in the lead role of Ichabod Crane, and the performances from a number of supporting cast members stand out as well, including Christopher Lee as the Burgomaster, who sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow, and Christopher Walken as the Headless Horseman. For the vast majority of the film, there's a lot of tension, which makes most of it consistently entertaining and really keeps the adrenaline pumping! The haunting musical score adds to this. The first romance scene with Ichabod and Katrina is probably the weakest part, but after that, the scenes involving the relationship between those two characters aren't so bad, and don't hurt the film.I know this has obviously been said many times in the past ten years, but Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" does take liberties with the story. Long before sitting down to watch the whole movie, I knew they changed Ichabod's profession from schoolmaster to police constable, and now that I've watched it, I realize there are more differences than that, from what I remember about the story (which certainly isn't everything). However, I'm not complaining. Since the movie is so entertaining, I really don't think it matters how much it follows the source material! Now, unlike some versions of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", this one is not for kids, which I'm sure one would assume with the R rating. But for adult viewers who like horror movies and admire creative filmmakers like Burton, watching this 1999 box office hit could easily be a hauntingly entertaining experience, and not likely a film one could easily forget!",Sleepy Hollow
125,jhclues,Gothic Horror From Tim Burton,9,5 January 2001,"The tale of Ichabod Crane comes to life as never before, in this richly textured and detailed offering of the timeless legend, `Sleepy Hollow,' directed by Tim Burton.  In this dark and vividly imaginative, definitive version, Johnny Depp plays Crane, a New York City Police Constable at the end of the Eighteenth Century, who is dispatched northward by his superiors to the hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, to investigate the grisly murders of three of it's citizens.  Crane has been chosen, not because he is considered a man of vision for employing the latest scientific techniques in his investigations, but rather because his methods are looked upon askance by his colleagues, and they welcome the chance to be rid of him.  He is, they feel, something of an embarrassment to their community, and therefore better relegated to a small, out-of-the-way township of diminutive significance, whereupon his arrival he learns that the murders all share a common thread: In each case, the head has been severed from the body, and carried off.  And so, equipped with the latest and most sophisticated wherewithal science has to offer (many instruments of which are of his own design), Constable Crane begins his investigation. 	Working from a terrific screenplay by Kevin Yagher (adapted from the story by Washington Irving), Burton makes use of magnificent sets and the talents of an exemplary cast to bring his tale to life.  He creates an atmosphere of darkness and foreboding that permeates the drama and captures that same sense of menace and disquietude evoked by the classic horror films of the 30's and 40's, such as `Frankenstein,' `Dracula,' `The Wolf Man,' and the like, and infuses it with some rather graphic, yet stylishly presented and realistic decapitations and various other bloodlettings, all enhanced and delivered with cutting-edge special F/X.  All of which, for the fan of true gothic horror, becomes a bona fide cauldron of unspeakable delights.  It must be noted that none of this is presented in a fashion anywhere near to what could be considered a `gore-fest' by any stretch of the imagination; Burton maintains the gothic aspects of the story, visually and dramatically, and renders it all with a touch of real class.  Never does he sink to casting about for a gross visual, or attempt to manipulate a situation for the sake of some cheap thrills.  It's a matter of integrity-- artistic and otherwise-- and Burton has it; it also demonstrates that he has a respect for his audience, for which he is to be commended, as he works in an industry in which that attitude of consideration does not necessarily prevail. 	Depp gives an exceptional performance as Crane, affecting a style reminiscent of Colin Clive in the original `Frankenstein,' or Basil Rathbone in `Son Of Frankenstein,' which fits so nicely with all that Burton is attempting (successfully) to do with this film.  It signals that rare rapport between actor and director wherein a concurrent vision is realized, for all of these attributes of the classical actor that Depp brings to the character are exactly what Burton needed from his star to make the film work so well; the aspect it lends to the final product evinces the same difference as that between a fiddle and a Stradivarius.  In a similar vein, in a supporting role, Michael Gambon gives a performance as Baltus Van Tassel that is akin to that of Depp's in adding to the overall ambience of the film, as does Richard Griffiths as Magistrate Samuel Philipse. 	The leading ladies also answer Burton's exacting call, especially Christina Ricci as Katrina Anne Van Tassel, and Miranda Richardson, who casts a spell as Lady Van Tassel.  Rounding out the supporting cast are Lisa Marie (Lady Crane), Casper Van Dien (Brom Van Brunt), Jeffrey Jones (Reverend Steenwyck), Ian McDiarmid (Dr. Lancaster), Michael Gough (Notary Hardenbrook), Mark Pickering (Young Masbath) and, especially menacing in a pivotal role, Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman.  As he did before with such films as `Edward Scissorhands' and `The Nightmare Before Christmas,' Tim Burton, with `Sleepy Hollow,' has given us yet another entertaining and exciting film that veritably carves out a singular niche for itself in the genre of the unique.  It's a quality film that deserves a special place in every DVD or video collection.  Truly one to be appreciated and savored.  I rate this one 9/10.",Sleepy Hollow
126,SanteeFats,Entertaining,7,16 February 2014,"A different take on the Sleepy Hollow tale. This one takes place only twenty years after the Hessian scum has been killed and buried. He has returned and is slaughtering people right and left. Johnny Depp plays the forward thinking constable sent up from the big city to solve the cases. He teams up with the son of one of the killed men since he is the only one who has the courage (or stupidity) to assist the constable. As things progress Depp goes to what I guess is a with. She does a conjuration using bats blood and gets a prosaic quote. Riding on he comes across Christina Ricci, the mayor's daughter, in the woods. They team up and find the death tree. Here is where the heads are stuffed into it and Depp surmises that the horseman is reaping heads until his is returned. Casper Van Dien actually gets a decent role in this movie, it seems he usually gets the B movie action roles. There are some dream sequences that fill in some back story Depp's character. Also Ricci appears to be a witch of some sort as she brews a potion to help Depp recover from the Horseman's attack. After seeing a family tree Depp finally figures out what the connection is between the murders and the horseman. He finds out that it is a conspiracy between the four town elders to ensure the passing down of a large fortune to the right person. The real question is who is the one that stole the horseman's skull, that is who is controlling it to do his bidding. Turns out it is the stepmother who is using the horseman to exact revenge for her family's displacement from their farm. Anyway Depp, Ricci and the boy climb to the top of a windmill which goes up in an explosion of flames with the horseman inside. Since the horseman was already dead he survives and chases after the escaping trio. Of course he catches them and there is a fight scene. Coming across his skull at the end the horseman ends up taking the stepmother as his bride? and the rst is film history.s",Sleepy Hollow
127,Stampsfightclub,A few bumps but will please any Burton fan,6,1 April 2010,"Ichabod Crane (Depp) ventures to Sleepy Hollow, a place of frequent murders by the apparent legend of the Headless Horseman and soon Crane finds himself deeper than his intention.The visionary director of darkness Tim Burton delivers another darkly stunning stroke of a creepy legend that sees Johnny Depp star as a detective investigating the strange happenings at the uncomfortable settings of Sleepy Hollow.Based on Washington Irving's story, Burton's 1999 take is dark and grizzly with his typical dark styling any fan would love. The design and shots of the Hollow are typically haunting and exudes the moment in the script to be sharp and interesting, giving audiences the occasional jump along with awe at the accomplishment of the idea of a mass murderer in Burton's wonderland.Since he launched on our screens in the 1980's the director has certainly created a vivid depiction of happy is sad and sad is happy with a florescent wave of dark semiotics and appreciation of the story, Edward Scissorhands and Beetle juice stand outs.Here, with the story arguably one of the darkest he has ever tackled bar Sweeney Todd, we see him take up a more action orientated agenda. Chases in woods on horseback, spooky magic connotations and deathly sword swipes give a strong vibe of excitement and bliss to fill the room with engaged faces.There are a few drawbacks to this motive, particularly given the story's intentions. For one, the opening stages with Crane in court and then riding towards the Hollow is all very formal and rather drab and then encoding spurts of action in the story's moment doesn't feel quite right. One example would be when in the forest and Crane goes inside the tree trunk and the bizarre happenings in there feel disorientated in the plot's motive to suss out the villain.Marginally Burton salvages these with the wonderfully shot action moments anyway but the feeling of the story is never quite right in its overall intention as a crime and with horror to justify, there was too much ambition intended.Depp, like in From Hell, puts on a brave accent that, whilst articulate, doesn't get away from his character being incredibly frustrating to watch. The nervous and confused detective is often misbalanced through dissecting a body then crying over a spider that won't give any edgy viewers confidence.Not that there are too many frights anyway, which given the story of a headless serial killer, is a shame.The supporting cast of Ricci, Gambon and Richardson do the necessities of back filling historical foundation well enough and Danny Elfman's score once more is inch perfect.Given the promise it is a slight let down but regardless Burton carves up glorious set design and action that will please his army of fans.",Sleepy Hollow
128,CharltonBoy,A Modern Hammer House Of Horror Flick.,6,20 August 2000,"Sleepy Hollow is superbly shot and the special affects are good and the acting is o.k but there is something about this movie that just does not do it for me. It does get a little confusing at times when they are trying to find who is responsible for the headless horseman but i dont think that is what i didnt like about it. All i can think of is that i couldnt tell if the actors and actresses were playing a serious roll or comedy rolls. Johnny Depp seemed to act with a smirk on is face that said ""This is a carry on movie , so lets camp it up "" I didnt dislike the film but on the other hand it will slip from the memory rather fast. 6 out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow
129,gbheron,Tim Burton on His Game,8,22 June 2002,"Love that Tim Burton. In ""Sleepy Hollow"", he has taken the Washington Irving novella and rewritten it for the screen. Irving fans find this a sacrilege, but the story is not nearly as important as the storytelling. This is a Burton film remember, and the sets, lighting, costumes, and props all create an incredible visual, almost palpable environment. A Hudson Valley town circa 1800 via Gothic Mittel Europa. The visual atmosphere is cinematic perfection. This alone is worth the price or a ticket or rental. And the acting; Depp and Burton work very well together and this is no exception. Depp's Ichobod Crane, now a forensics detective instead of a schoolteacher, is just the right mixture of satire, false bravado, and fear. Christina Ricci is sexy and mysterious as his love interest/adversary. And an unbilled Christopher Walken, as the Headless Horseman, takes his role to the top, but not over. I won't go into the plotting, except to say that outside of the title, locale, and the Headless Horseman, little is recognizable from the original story. But who cares?

130,Bob-45,Great Coming of Age Movie for Christina Ricci,7,26 November 1999,"SLEEPY Hollow is bloody, very exciting and sometimes scary retelling of Washington Irving's classic short story THE LEGEND OF SLEEPY HOLLOW.  People are dieing in the small village of Sleepy Hollow, and New York City Detective Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is directed by a city judge (Christopher Lee) to investigate.  All the victims have died in the same manner; their heads have been severed by one blow of a broadsword. Legend has it the wielder of that sword is ""The Headless Horseman,"" a ""walking undead"" (well, riding, anyway) apparition of a dead Hessian (Christopher Walken, satisfyingly goulish) Visiting the village, Depp begins to uncover the sinister secrets of the village, as well as his own deeply-hidden past. He falls in love with the daughter of the richest man in the village (Christina Ricci) and finds himself the target of her jealous suitor (Casper Von Dien).  As Depp delves closer to the truth, he must not only face the horseman, but his own fearsand cynicism. This is a great coming of age movie for Christina Ricci.  Her character is definitely a woman, not just a sexpot, like most of her recent outings. Miranda Richardson plays her stepmother, and I've loved her since she played the evil queen Maub in MERLIN.  The best performances are Ricci, Johnny Depp and (surprisingly) Casper Von Dien.  The story is way too convoluted.  I never did completely put all of it together.  And the culprit is surpisingly easy to spot.  Still, the film is exciting and has great atmosphere.  The cinematography is perfect, cold, brittle, gloomy where it needs to be. Ricci looks like a Bottacelli Venus with her lush figure, creamy skin and surprisingly natural-looking blonde hair.  Worth a look, despite the gore.",Sleepy Hollow
131,stamper,It's Tim Burton allright!!!!!,8,16 July 2000,"This is a creepy, dark, yet strange fantasy / horror flick in the likes of well Tim Burton. Only he could make this the creepy fairytale it has become. But it is not merely his doing that makes this one such a good film. Johnny Depp (as the New Yorker who at first mocks the small - towners for their beliefs and then becomes astonished and terrified after witnessing the Headless Horseman) and Christina Ricci (as the fair, enchanting, mystic, big breasted (she's not playing that you must know .DAMN) maiden who is attracted to Depp) are really good + they also have good chemistry. By the way, another comment on Ricci, I like what she does, always playing non  ordinary women + I like the way she looks, no too pretty and painted and plastic, but normal, natural an pretty good (THANK GOD, NOT EVERYONE IS A BRITNEY SPEARS - -LIKE MODEL, which also is true of the pretty Kate Winslet of course. GO GIRLS!!!!!!!!)
The supporting cast is good too, as is the music the decoration, the blood, the story and of course the Headless Horseman (note: THE HEADLESS ONE). That stuntman (RAY PARK) is really great, swinging that axe and sword and fighting. He's GREAT just as he was in The Phantom Menace (please HOLLYWOOD  PEOPLE, choose him more often.

132,jamesraeburn2003,"""Crafted with passion.""",9,26 April 2005,"Tim Burton really is one of the most important fantasy film makers of our time. He crafts his films with a passion that is absent from most other contemporary directors. Many modern day movies are addled with special effects and little else, but Burton has shown in films such as Ed Wood and in Sleepy Hollow that he is a good old-fashioned story teller who loves his art.Sleepy Hollow (based on the story by Washington Irving) is set in New York in 1799 and tales the story of the forward thinking Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) who is sneered at by his colleagues because of his advanced techniques in detecting how a person died by performing autopsies. Don't forget that back then when a doctor cut up a body in search of the truth, they were seen as sorcerers!. Crane is sent by the Burgomaster (Christopher Lee) to the small village of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of killings in which the victims have all been ritually beheaded by what the superstitious locals believe to have been committed by a headless horseman. During the course of his investigations, Crane stumbles upon sexual deviances, old rivalries and witchcraft.Sleepy Hollow is very much in the style of the earlier Hammer films not only because it features two of Hammer's veterans in the cast, Christopher Lee as the Burgomaster and Michael Gough as Notary James Hardenbrook, but the set design by Rick Heinrichs and the cinematography of Emmanuel Lubezki bare all the style of that studios best films. Of course the violence is more graphic here because times have moved on since Hammer were the kings of horror. However, there is echoes of the style and poetry which make them great to watch forty years on here. There have been many rumours of Hammer making a comeback and if that did ever materialise, I think Tim Burton would make the perfect substitute for Terence Fisher as he displays some of that film makers qualities. Good characterisations, atmosphere and a welcome touch of intelligence to what in other film makers hands would of been pure sensationalist material.",Sleepy Hollow

136,ja_kitty_71,Tim Burton's take on the classic Washington Irving story,10,25 June 2008,"I get a nack for literary movies. Even films based on the classic horror novels with literature's famous monsters: Count Dracula, The Frankenstien Monster, Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde; The Phantom of The Opera, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and...The Headless Horseman. Also I love Tim Burton's films, I have a few of them actually. Out of the two versions of this classic Washington Irving story, I love both the Disney animated version narrated (and sang) by Bing Crosby and this gruesome, Gothic film version starring two of my favorite actors - Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci.In this version, Ichabod Crane is a constable from New York in 1799, who is most concerned with all the new scientific gadgets that will allow him to do his job better. However, he is quite squeamish about his latest assignment: traveling to the town of Sleepy Hollow, where there have been a series of murders involving people whose heads have been cut off. Upon his arrival, the four town elders informs him that the three victims were killed in open ground, and the heads had disappeared - taken by a headless ghost that is supposedly responsible. Ichabod is unconvinced of this, but learns more about the ghostly horseman. It is the ghost of a vicious Hessian sent to aid the British during the Revolutionary War, and he was caught by revolutionaries and decapitated with his own sword. When Ichabod sees the ghost kill one of the town council members, his skepticism evaporates. And then, he soon discovers that the horseman's ghost has an unholy connection to Baltus Van Tassel a wealthy farmer, and whose daughter (Katrina) he is falling in love with.Overall, this is an awesome film. Johnny gives it wit, humour and charm. This film is also great for the October month close to Halloween; or any month.",Sleepy Hollow

138,Jack the Ripper1888,Perfect! Marvelous in every way!,10,20 April 2002,"This movie was one of the best horror pictures that I have ever seen. It is very good that this movie won the Academy Award for art direction. Everything really looks like how it would have looked back in the 18th century. I thought that sky looked really cool. It was all gloomy and gray and kinda foreshadowed what would happen. Creepy stuff. Johnny Depp plays young Constable Ichabod Crane, an unbelieving skeptic who believes that for every murder, there is someone of flesh and blood behind it. But, this time, he may be wrong. People are being decapitated in the small woodsy town of Sleepy Hollow that the townspeople believe to be the handiwork of a legendary Headless Horseman. Now, Johnny Depp gave us one of the best performances of his career here. This was a great movie that wouldn't have been the same without him. I really like his wimpy accent that he puts on. It really sounds authentic. Christina Ricci is also great as Katrina Van Tassel, a young girl with secrets to hide. The Horseman really looked cool. In the flashback scenes, we have Christopher Walken playing the horseman in an uncredited role. And the only words that he ever really says are ""Ungh"" and ""shhh"". There is also some really graphic violence. Beheadings galore. If you are one with a weak stomach, then maybe you should hold off on this one just a little while longer. But if you don't have a weak stomach and still haven't seen this movie- SEE IT NOW! And after you are done with this film and still want something more, then check out FROM HELL. That movie is a little similar and is also played by Johnny Depp. I also liked Casper Van Dien in this movie. He is a great actor that we don't see enough of. The opening sequence is cool, where we see a Pumpkin-headed scarecrow looking in on an unsuspecting man. SLEEPY HOLLOW is one of the best movies of its genre ever.

140,deatman9,eerily beautiful,6,26 October 2012,This movie is typical Tim Burton style but this has got to be one of his best movies. The special effects and visual effects are amazing and the cinematography is stunning. The only real flaw with this movie in my opinion is the story line but that had nothing to do with Tim Burton as this story already existed..This movie is about a young detective who is sent from the city to invesitage 3 murders in a small town. He goes there with a logical frame of mind but as rumors from the towns people include a headless horseman he is forced to think outside the box as this might be true.This movie was pretty good just not the best. I frankly don't like the story line but the way Burton did it was stunning. He made it very visually pleasing and that has to be the best part followed closely by Depps acting who is always great.,Sleepy Hollow
141,Prichards12345,Looks fantastic but never quite engages as it should,6,29 October 2016,"I found this a little hard to pin down but if there is a problem with Sleepy Hollow then it probably lies with Johnny Depp and the depiction of supernatural fantasy here without ever making it convincing. Depp is all over the place in this one, adopting a comic tone in a movie that really shouldn't have one, and coming across like a poor man's Bob Hope than anything else. His frequent fainting is ridiculous.To make the supernatural convincing in movies you need to build up to it and handle it carefully; but Tim Burton just throws it at the viewer, making it far less believable (and effective) than it could have been. The main compensations in the film are how jaw-droppingly Gothic-gorgeous it looks (almost taken for granted when Tim Burton's the director), and the chance to see some great old actors do their stuff. Christopher Lee, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough (yayy the star of Konga is back!) etc give it an air of class, and Christopher Walken is genuinely creepy as the horseman.Burton's main weakness is that he struggles to tell his story as well as he might - probably only in Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood (maybe he should film MR. ED next!) does he keep the narrative on an even keel. And yet his love of horror films is so genuine it comes through in every frame. The windmill used at the film's climax is surely an homage to both Frankenstein and The Brides of Dracula. If only Depp had played it straight the movie might have worked much better.",Sleepy Hollow
142,tomimt,Gothic fairytale,8,30 September 2006,"If someone would ask me a good movie to introduce himself on the works of Tim Burton I would suggest him either 'Edward Sciccorhands' or this, because they both have so similar atmosphere and they show Burton doing something he's good at: Gothic fairytale for adults.'Sleepy Hollow' is stylish Gothic tale of a young inspector Ichiabod Crane (who else than Johnny Depp), who is sent to a remote village of Sleepy Hollow to find a culprit, who has decapitated 4 of the god fearing towns folk. When he arrives he learns, that the villagers believe the murderer to be no else than the Hessian Horsman (Chirstopher Walken), whose headless ghost has rose from the Hell to claim the heads of all who foolishly happen on his path. Crane's modern thinking is put to test after he learns that the case is in fact so and together with a son of one the victims Masbath (Marc Pickering) and lovely Katrina (Christina Ricci) he begins the search of the one, who has summoned the horrid hell spawn.'Sleepy Hollow' is from the better side of Tim Burtons movies: it's visually stunning, the music by his court composer Danny Elfman fits in and brings out incredible atmosphere and the actors are doing their parts all around nicely. But if you want to pick something, then the take the script, as it does indeed leave some room for improvement and there are some minor plot holes, but then again this movie isn't meant to be looked so seriously from that direction, as the plot does work in the scale it is meant to work: a fantastic, grim fairytale.",Sleepy Hollow

Both him and Christina Ricci do well in this stylistic period thriller, which is successful, because its original, fresh, and despite the dialogue which is heavy, its still entertaining throughout. The acting and atmosphere is what sets it apart from mediocre films of its kind. This movie is suspenseful because the music, cinematography and acting all contribute to keep it frightening, yet compelling. Another solid Johnny Depp performance and film. At times it seemed a bit long, but the third act picks up the pace and does well to finish off strong. I would have liked the build-up to be a bit better, but unlike a lot of films that fall apart trying to finish the story, this film does the opposite and doesn't do the best job setting up the plot, but the final 25 minutes or so are very good. 7/10",Sleepy Hollow
144,Movie-12,"A visual masterpiece, pure Tim Burton. ***1/2 out of ****",8,16 December 1999,"SLEEPY HOLLOW (1999) ***1/2Starring: Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, and Christopher Walken Director: Tim Burton   Running Time: 102 minutes   Rated R (for graphic horror violence and gore, and brief sexuality)By Blake French:	Tim Burton is just about as good as they get in the movie business when it comes to creating an atmospheric world to inhabit specific characters. ""Sleepy Hollow"" is the perfect kind of movie for his directional Midas touch; it resembles the best of Burton in every way. In the film, an adaptation based on a story by Washington Irving called The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, he captures the slumbering, creepy village of Sleepy Hollow with vivid details and imaginative description. The way everything is presented, the trees look like something out of a fairy tale and the scenery represents deception in a mysterious wonderland, is what makes this production one of the years most captivating and magical film experiences.
	Some of the visual credit should also be given to the film's Cinematographer, Emmanuel Lubezki, and the credited production designer, Rick Heinrichs. These elements contribute a great deal of success to Burton's masterpiece. Both the design and Cinematography are some of the best seen all year, and deserve a hard earned Oscar Nomination. They make the film intriguing and visually stimulating. 	The film takes place in the late 1700's, in New York. Constable Ichabod Crane, a timid and but smart man played by Johnny Depp, is assigned to investigate a series of grizzly murders in a nearby town called Sleepy Hollow. He's rather concerned about his latest task, however, due to the content of the killings. The victim's heads have been sliced, in one clean sweep, straight from their bodies. He accepts his duties, and travels by horse and carriage to the isolated village. 	Once Ichabod arrives, the locals, including Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon), Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien), and Reverend Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones), greet him with eagerness. They explain the legend of the headless horseman, who is supposedly causing the murders in their town. At first he is skeptical. Then, after witnessing a victim losing their head personally, he arrives at the conclusion that a headless horseman is responsible for the tragic catastrophes accruing. Ichabod soon meets Katrina Van Tassel, an innocent looking, self spoken young woman who may have some advice, as well as several secrets of her own.	The Headless horseman is a perfect portrayed villain for ""Sleepy Hollow."" He is brute, oversized, and roughly textured with outwear. The actor who brings him to life when his head is on is perfect for the role; Christopher Walken. For some odd reason, however, popular film critic Roger Ebert reluctantly refused to tell his readers the name of the actor, thinking it would give something away. Well, I am sorry, Mr. Ebert, but it isn't that hard to find this information elsewhere. The filmmakers are not trying to hold Walken as a secret. Stating he stars as the headed horseman gives nothing away. One must see his performance and make up for themselves to even imagine what material the film's bad guy brings forth.
	Tim Burton's direction is focused and wonderfully observant here. The murder sequences are gory and violent, but never way over the top. Burton never losses sight of his main characters, has a good idea about what he wants to place in film, and the special effects do not distract his ability to do so. He has a knack for allowing an audience to become involved with his pictures. We must think for ourselves, figuring out nuggets of the plot on our own, without the projectors help. He has demonstrated these techniques before in such films as ""Edward Scissorhands,"" ""The Nightmare Before Christmas,"" and even the best Batman film yet, ""Batman Returns."" 
	Johnny Depp offers an Oscar worthy performance as Ichabod Crane. He brings the squeamish role to life effortlessly with striking details and perfect form. He is flawlessly cast, as well as Christina Ricci, who also acts with style and poignancy. Compliments also go out to splendid costuming the actors are permitted to wear. 	Although ""Sleepy Hollow"" offers lots of creepy impressions, the film is far from being very scary. Some moments do generate some minor thrills, but for the most part, the production is not as terrifying as it could have been. Much of it lacks momentum and build-up for the dozen or so graphic beheadings that take place. Burton could have easily loaded his picture with bombarding amounts of shock value, suspense, and tension filled fright, but instead goes for all out violence, plot, and mystery. Not that this effects the overall production. This is more of an atmospheric movie than a scream feast. The atmosphere is certainly above the average. 	The conclusion of ""Sleepy Hollow"" works in a bizarre, but unpredictable fashion. The climax occurs unexpectedly and excitingly, with much surprise and special effects. The film's foreshadowing is effective, but regardless of how experienced of a filmgoer you are, this is one ending that is not meant to be figured out before it takes place. It is one of the preferred closings I've seen in a while. Despite a few personal objections, ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a brilliantly crafted work of art--one of the years better films.

145,alice liddell,"Not the best film from the greatest director we have, but still towers above everything else.(possible spoiler)",6,12 January 2000,"Richer than it appears on a surface level, this is still a bit disappointing from the director who gave us the greatest film of the last 20 years.  It is not immediately apparent what is lacking.  Burton's visual style is as ravishing as ever, if not as expansive - sometimes it feels as if he is working on a smaller budget than usual.  Part of the joy of Tim Burton is that, like you, he has seen the wonderful imaginative possibilities of Roger Corman and Hammer Horror foundered by a lack of money to see them through, and is determined to rectify this.The muted Gothic of the dusks, the forests, the late-eighteenth century mansions and towns, the austere churches, the horses, the villagers, the public rites, are astonishingly evocative, much more so that the rather perfunctory special effects.  Even better are the stunning dream sequences - a mixture of gleaming white, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS-like pastel and emotion, snatches of lurid red, dream and violence - that are among the best things Burton has done.The actors have been criticised for favouring caricature over character, but people forget that what made the figure of Edward Scissorhands, say, so moving was not Johnny Depp's performance, which, if taken in isolation, was rather stiff and unyielding, but Burton's visualisation of Edward's emotional subjectivity, like a great melodramatic director, though colour, composition, set design, and camera movement.  The failure is not Depp's performance, which is often amusing, but Burton's inability to anchor it expressively.SLEEPY HOLLOW is quite brilliant at undermining its surface narrative. Washington Irving's tale, and the book it derived from - 'The Sketch Book of Geoffrey Crayon' - is often seen as the starting point of American literature, and cultural ideas about the notion of America, as it struggles to free itself from the dead weight of Europe.  Burton's film, 200 years on, has the opposite vantage point, at the end of these notions: he knows how they have developed, and what they have led to.  He has also open to him tools never available to Irving: e.g. Freud, Lacan, Derrida etc.So, on one level, the film deconstructs the creation of American history, dramatising a prosperous, seemingly self-made, professional nation at the mercy of both the returning repressed, and the unbreakable codes of Europe. This is seen most clearly in its treatment of women, in the obscene gap between Ideality and reality.  The only unadulteratedly positive female in the film is a murdered dream figure.  Crane is quick to demonise Katrina as a witch whenever he can't rationalise a problem; ditto Lady Van Tassel, whose grievances are just, and whose oppression is firmly rooted in European feudalism.This demonising can be seen as the fruit of Crane's movement from scientific rationalist into a supposedly religious society riddled with pagan superstition and fear.  The move to America from Europe has only resulted in the transplanting of the old Ideas - the murders concern either land or sex. And yet, paradoxically, it is the conservative entity of the family that suffers most, representing the conventional society Lady Van Tassel wreaks merry havoc on.One of the film's dominant metaphors is that of seeing, perception.  Crane is a scientific detective (a lovely joke: the man who earns his living using his head investigating the Headless Horseman), arrives in Sleepy Hollow with new-fangled, self-created tools which include elaborate machines for improving what he sees.  This allows for greater accuracy in studying the dead, the past, but as the legends of Sleepy Hollow begin to prey on his mind, allied with the demons of his own past, Crane becomes less able to see with scientific detachment.With all the scenes of Crane in bed, and the attendant implications of dreaming and madness, as well as an increased hysteria in the action, the status of what we see - is it truth, or just Crane's colouring of reality - is called into question, making even more ambiguous Irving's rather facile ironies.  Burton makes sure not to show us the murderer at the beginning: it doesn't materialise until Crane has heard the legend.This ambiguity is largely achieved by completely changing the character of Ichabod Crane, a teacher in the tale, not a detective; someone who passes on tradition and learning rather than uncovering it; someone so susceptible to the supernatural that he actively seeks it out, both by studying it, and by listening to old wives' tales.  Irving's Crane is far from a hero: physically grotesque, cruel, sadistic, greedy, cowardly.  Depp's Crane is more fastidious than a wuss.  By using the figure whose role is to find, see and interpret, Burton is better able to undermine him.What confirms the doubtfulness of what we see is Crane's Oedipal confusions, his idealisation of a mother, who was killed by a brute, bible-bashing husband; and Katrina, who is constantly linked to her - he rejects her when she refuses to be as passive and ideal as he would like, becoming an artist and director with her Evil Eye.  The two women murdered have maternal association - the widow murdered with child, and the midwife: examples of fertility and corporeality that threaten the ideal.For Crane is a virgin, and is terrified of real, sexual women - the profusion of blood squirted on him; the visual play of red and white; his only illusory ability to cage the bird (traditional emblem of female captivity), compounded by its red setting.  Lady Von Tessel only becomes the villain after Crane sees her having illicit sex, her maiming herself both a Hester Prynne-like mark of her sexual sin, but also proof of her own sado-masochistic control of her body and sexuality.This so offends Crane, and the new America he represents, that he must cast her out, link her to death and castration (the Headless Horseman), to perversion of nature (the extraordinary Tree of the Dead, Munch-like in its harrowing grief).  As with all his great films - BATMAN, EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD, MARS ATTACKS! - Burton uses the perceived detritus of its popular culture to express profound disillusion with the nature of America.  A brilliant, honorable failure.",Sleepy Hollow

148,khatcher-2,"Well, there was nothing else on offer .........",6,2 November 2002,"I could never be a Tim Burton fan, and even less still one of Johnny Depp's. However, on seeing that this film is based on a story by Washington Irving, I thought I would give it a try . With the result of a few mixed feelings. My attitude towards both Burton and Depp have not changed in the slightest.
Irving gave rather good accounts of stories based on the mythical and fantasy-surrealist, generally in a historic context, that is to say, in a specific place at a specific moment. His tales have become minor classics in a way. I would thoroughly recommend `Tales from The Alhambra' for example.
What the film has in its favour is good photography, mostly good musical accompaniment which at times became somewhat overly present, better than good scene-setting and directing, and Christina Ricci; as well as some of the other actors playing very interesting rôles. The story is right: the treatment was a little wrong. This is basically because on a number of occasions the scenes being enacted take on a certain comic perspective, which, following Irving's story, should never have become apparent. Maybe another actor instead of Depp. No; that would not have saved the situation: Burton could not repress these comic failures, which lent nothing to the telling of the story.Anyway, it was not a worthless watch: I enjoyed some of it, even most of it. But I wish people would be more faithful to the original story when adapting one for the screen. For example, do not worry about trying to see `The Ninth Gate' starring Johnny Depp, adapted by Polanski from the novel `La Novena Puerta' by Arturo Pérez-Reverte (qv): absolutely a sacrilegious outrage which the original book does not deserve at all.",Sleepy Hollow

Visually incredible with a photograph, scenery and beautiful costumes and has not won many technical awards, the script is well written, although I prefer a darker plot, he is efficient and knows how to introduce the characters at the beginning and make connections to them at the end, this is a positive point. The direction is by Tim Burton and he does what he knows to use the atmosphere more down to earth and make a tale of legend. In the cast the performances are good and do not leave anything to be desired.

Sleepy Hollow is Tim Burton's adaptation of Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. This movie is a feast for the eyes from the spooky, Gothic-like town of Sleepy Hollow, the fog that is everywhere and the dark, foreboding woods where the Headless Horseman emerges from to claim his victims (and their head).Which brings me to the story, which is rich and packed full of twists. Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is New York Police Constable sent to the farming village Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of bizarre and gruesome murders. The victims are decapitated and their heads taken. Here he meets and falls in love with Katrina van Tassel (Christina Ricci), the daughter of Baltus van Tassel (Michael Gambon), the head of the village. He also meets Reverand Steenwyck (Jeffrey Jones), Magistrate Philipse (Richard Griffiths), Doctor Lancaster (Ian McDiarmid) and Notary Hardenbrook (Michael Gough) who all tell him the story of the Headless Horseman, the villain who is responsible for our headless people.All of these actors, especially a troubled Johnny Depp and Christian Ricci, are excellent in their roles. The costumes the actors wore also need to complimented, they were excellent and they definitely deserved the Oscar nod they got. The special effects were excellent, with plenty of bloody decapitations and sword fights. Also on that note, the Headless Horseman was a very creepy, brutal character and portrayed very sinisterly by Christopher Walken when he had a head.Kudos must go to Burton for his direction, though. Without his style this movie would not have been half as good as it is. The dark, Gothic style really suited the story and the mood he created.

But I think he's funny, visually inventive, and has surprising depth.  I think he was the wrong person to do the BATMAN movies, but I've enjoyed all of his other movies, especially EDWARD SCISSORHANDS and ED WOOD, which, by coincidence, both happen to be the movies starring Johnny Depp.  So it follows I was eagerly looking forward to SLEEPY HOLLOW, their latest collaboration.For about 2/3 of the way, this was good.  The look, as usual, was stunning, and he does a good job of creating tension, menace, and atmosphere.  The five character actors playing the town's leading citizens(including Burton favorite Jeffrey Jones, who appeared in BEETLEJUICE and ED WOOD) add to that menace.  The sound of the sword alone was scary.  Christina Ricci doesn't get a lot to do, but she does look lovely, and looks appropriate to the period and the town.  As for Depp, this is a parody of sorts from him; he's applying the Ichabod Crane of the original story and playing him as if he really were a police constable(If he had played it straight, the movie would have felt wrong from the beginning).  This is most apparent in the scene where he's using gadgets to explain what is already obvious to the rest of the town.The problem, however, comes when it's time to wrap things up.  One of the screenwriters here is Andrew Kevin Walker, who wrote SEVEN.  That was a serial killer movie with a difference, which didn't follow a traditional formula, but was disturbing and original.  Here, however, we get the feeling that he felt, despite Burton's attachment and the story's horror roots, this was in essence a serial killer movie, and gave it a conventional ending.  In retrospect, without giving anything away, the ending is logical, but it hangs on a couple of details which are barely  on-screen, and is handled so flatly that the movie bogs down, just when it's supposed to excite us most. Also, some of the characters involved are so sketchy, the explanations about them feel last-minute to cover up weak parts of the story.  If someone had found a less literal-minded ending, I think that would have worked better. As it is, it's a good film, but it's Burton's first non-BATMAN film I've had problems with.",Sleepy Hollow

However, the film is quite good in its own right. It's a nice mix of horror and beheadings and a little comedy as well. Depp is brilliant as Ichabod Crane -- he does a lot of swooning while trying to remain calm. But hey, if a headless Christopher Walken on a black horse was coming after you set to separate your head from your body with a long sword, wouldn't you swoon at least once as well? :-) ""Sleepy Hollow"" definitely got that dark Tim Burton-feel over it, while it is not as strange as some of his other films, and there's some comic relief as well and thank god for that because otherwise all those beheadings would have been insufferable.

160,romanorum1,Science or Superstition?,7,9 December 2015,"There is no question that Director Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" is as atmospheric as movies come, but the feature could have much better. It certainly has nice production design, art direction, and cinematography. Loosely based upon Washington Irving's short story, ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" the stylish period piece (1799) falters from incoherency and a middling script. Even though Burton draws upon Irving's settings and characters – like Ichabod Crane, ""Brom Bones"" Van Brunt, and Katrina Van Tassel – his screenwriter, Andrew Kevin Walker, does a great disservice to the source material as he turns a folk tale into a horror flick. Also, the movie simply does not know which way to turn. Initially it seems to promote progress by referencing reason and scientific knowledge, but then reverts to witchcraft. The original Irving story's main premise involved Ichabod and Brom fighting for Katrina's attention. Here it is hardly played out. By adding a back-story – childhood flashbacks of Crane's childhood – does nothing to enhance the drama. It becomes somewhat gruesome with its pile of decapitated corpses. Even the gnarled tree is blood-soaked, and when Ichabod exhumes a female corpse, the blood is fresh.It begins promisingly. Before the opening credits, a coach carrying the town's leading citizen, lawyer Peter Van Garrett (Martin Landau) rolls in the fog-shrouded forest at dusk outside the misty Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, two days north of New York City, where ""everyone is related by blood or marriage."" Strange noises are heard, and Garret is astounded when he peeks outside the carriage window and sees that his driver has become headless. The carriage still rumbles along. When Garrett attempts to escape into a cornfield, his head is also lost. Other equally grizzly deaths follow, and, in all cases, the killer takes the victim's head. The folks of Sleepy Hollow are convinced that they are being haunted by the Headless Horseman, a demonic spirit of a dead German (Hessian) soldier (a mercenary of the Crown) who was slain by Continental soldiers during the American Revolution. He can see without his head, and has his lair in the gnarled tree in the Western Woods.Jittery Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) arrives; he's a constable sent by a judge in New York City to solve the bizarre murders of the ghastly horseman. Crane is not the superstitious schoolmaster of Irving's story. In fact, Ichabod claims that reason and science can explain any unusual feature about the deaths and that a ""modern"" detective method will solve the mystery. But he misspeaks when he boldly states that people are at the dawn of a ""new millennium"" (confusing the year 1800 with 2001). Anyway, he sneers at the idea of a supernatural being from Hell. At first it appears that the horseman may actually be the local bigwig, Brom Van Brunt (Casper Van Dien) in costume, but Ichabod soon learns that he must abandon reason. Brom does attack Ichabod with a pumpkin at the wooden covered bridge. In the original story though, the prank occurs at the end, when the believer in ghosts is easily fooled. As Ichabod's investigation continues he finds himself falling for blonde Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), the daughter of his landlord, Baltus Van Tassel (Michael Gambon).""Sleepy Hollow"" is creepy and effective largely because of Director Burton's visualization, cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezki's camera- work, and Rick Heinrichs' impressive production design. However, there comes a point when the main characters have to take the helm, something not allowed by the script (although the main actors do as well as granted). Much of ""Sleepy Hollow"" consists of the insipid Ichabod, with his bizarre instruments, constantly fainting and bungling to uncover the reason for the horseman's rampage. Then towards the end he finally has much of the puzzle pieced together. (The subplot about who double-crossed whom is convoluted.) Finally in the denouement – which goes on and on – Ichabod's skittish character magically morphs into the most heroic man on earth when he battles a demon! Irving focused on the romance angle, but the screen relationship of Ichabod with Katrina appears forced, and there is hackneyed dialogue between them. For instance, he says that she ""bewitched"" him (Actually she believes in sorcery.). Another time Ichabod inquires why she snooped inside his room. Katrina responds, ""Because it's yours."" (Ugh!) Positives include an impressive supporting cast. In addition to Baltus' Michael Gambon, several other well-known actors include Miranda Richardson (as Baltus' wife and the Crone), Michael Gough (notary), Ian McDiarmid (doctor), and Christopher Lee (cameo). Lee is the New York burgomaster who sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow. Christopher Walken has a cameo as the horseman before losing and regaining his head. Danny Elfman's music score is most suitable while the set direction is superb. Much of the movie was shot with a blue filter, and the Gothic village of Sleepy Hollow has the feel of the period (as does the city of New York). There is a nice, almost surreal touch when Ichabod arrives late. The hamlet appears almost deserted, with hardly a person or horse visible. But when Ichabod enters the mansion of prosperous farmer Van Tassel, a bustling Halloween party is in progress with perhaps most of the village in attendance. Another nice scene occurs just after the Halloween party (presumably 31 October) when the November mist extinguishes the exterior village torches. Its nicely signifies the end of the last bit of warmth and the dreariness of the incoming coldness.The negatives are probably not enough to detract one from watching ""Sleepy Hollow,"" but the movie should have been greater. Naming this movie something like ""The Horror of Goblin Hollow"" would have avoided the unfortunate comparison with Irving. But the director obviously wanted to capitalize on the famed author's story. A plot focusing on reason and with a conspiracy involving those awful-looking town honchos with a costumed headless horseman may have been a better option. Then again, one cannot deny the uniqueness of the story-line.",Sleepy Hollow
161,SkullScreamerReturns,Tim Burton's visually amazing gothic tale (but slightly hollow),8,23 July 2021,"Someone has said that Tim Burton's movies are more style than substance. I feel like that statement fits this film especially. I've always loved its visual look - the foggy fields and autumn-clad forests...that's perfect...but I always tend to forget what happens in the story, until watching again years later.The script is based on a quite popular novel/story so it can't be too bad. For some reason I have never read it, but someday... So, I can't exactly say if the film's main flaw is because of the book or the adaptation. Probably both. Fairytale-ish material don't easily create a very deep story unless that is the main aim of the projct....But knowing Burton he's not that kind of guy, no, he's about taking an imaginary story and making it look as fantastical as possible. I don't blame him, that's his thing. However, for example ""Big Fish"" was a film that got both right, the visuals and a story that blows me away every time. This one leaves the story a little bit on the marginal. I always seem to remember this movie as pictures painted on the canvas of my mind. When the movie was quite new, I downloaded Windows wallpapers of the movie's still images and had them in my computer. It's that kind of film.Hey, I have to comment also the cast. This will be a long paragraph. Well, I was never really a fan of Johnny Depp in this movie. He's a little bit too Johnny Depp... Not as comical as in the Pirates movies but he's a little bit quirky, and I might like a more serious performance better. Well, I'm under the impression that the character in the books might also be a bit eccentric so maybe it's just that. Then there's the lovely Christina Ricci for whom I had a crush back then when I was a teenager. Guess whose picture was on my desktop the most? Then there's of course Christopher Walken as the villain. It's a small role and he doesn't have much space to use his acting skills but he makes a cool looking monster-warrior anyway.Not done with the cast yet! Before watching the movie again tonight I did not remember that Christopher Lee was in it, the great Michael Gambon (from The Singing Detective), Michael Gough (Alfred from Batman), and Ian McDiarmid, among others. These are smaller roles but it's nice to see so many legendary actors. And the executive producer is no other than Francis Ford Coppola. Did not expect that.It's a movie that always leaves me yearning for more...something. The story does not make me feel enough something to call it a masterpiece. But still I kind of love it because of the atmosphere and simply beautiful images. Fans of gothic romanticism and Tim Burton's world of dark fairytales check it out. Try to see it from a big screen with good picture quality.",Sleepy Hollow

In this version, Ichabod (Johnny Depp) is a New York City detective whose unorthodox techniques and penchant for gadgets make him unpopular with is colleagues. He is sent to the remote town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of bizarre murders, in which a number of people have been found dead in the woods, with their heads cut off. Local legend has it that a Hessian ghost rides through the woods on horseback, lopping off the heads of the unsuspecting and unbelieving. Ichabod refuses to believe in this legend, convinced that there must be a logical explanation for the murders.

The whole film seemed like ""Naked Gun 4:Ye Olde Days"" starring Johnny Depp as an incredibly unfunny Frank Drebin, and I honestly couldn't stop thinking this whenever I saw him on screen. Christina Ricci's character seems so false and irritating I kept wishing she would loose her head in her opening scene! Saying this, the story is very good and Christopher Walken plays the most amazing character, although he is seen all too briefly for my liking - not much work for a lot of money no doubt. Miranda Richardson is by far the best talent in the film, unless Walken had more screen time. The story runs well but it seems to have missed what it was aiming for and doesn't know if it's trying to be a comedy or a gothic horror, and in this case the two just don't seem to mix.",Sleepy Hollow

Anyway, with that said I do like the environment, the spooky atmosphere. But like some movies that are all atmosphere, Sleepy Hollow has lots of substance, frights, gore effects, clever lines. Despite the change in the story, it actually works, plus it's CSI: COLONIAL, that was clever. Yes, I got to admit. This is a good movie and worthy of attention. 9 STARS.",Sleepy Hollow

This film is a visually striking fairy tale horror film with elements of romance and comedy. It is a  dark film but it is at the same time very tongue in cheek, and despite its gruesome moments it is not done in a nasty way. As usual Burtons visual style is very dark and gothic and once again he is working with Johnny Depp. Depp is fantastic in this film, he once again proves he is a very versatile actor and provides a faultless English accent and shows off his comical timing. Christina Ricci is also good as are the rest of the cast, particularly Miranda Richardson who is superb. Overall this is a very enjoyable film, it is a simple story based upon the old myth from America, of the headless horseman. Fantastic entertainment. ****",Sleepy Hollow
167,dead47548,Burton was made for Sleepy Hollow.,10,8 January 2008,"Tim Burton's entire career has been based on films that provide the paradox of a hauntingly magical style. I believe that Sleepy Hollow can be described as the perfect Tim Burton picture in the sense that it captures everything that comes to mind when you think of the man. The Gothic style, haunting ambiance, bizarre and wickedly charismatic humor and a sense that you're living in a dark fairy tale for a few hours. It stays morbidly entertaining all the way throughout and never fails at keeping you on the edge of your seat. Burton crafts another phenomenal work that utterly defines his unique style.Everyone knows the story of the Headless Horseman from their childhood, but this takes a much darker and necessary tone to the tale than seen before. The technical aspects of the feature certainly help to achieve this and create wonders for the eye to behold. The sets are vast and glorious, creating that perfectly Gothic ambiance and almost Wicker Man-esquire eeriness. In fact the entire film has a lot of similarities with The Wicker Man from the supernatural ideals to the suspense of knowing that something is going on that is much bigger than what we believe. The cinematography, costumes and visuals all add to create a poetically dreary experience that is sure to please in every element.Burton also shows his strong ability in the casting category. The choice of Depp for the leading role of Ichabod Crane (a character who was portrayed as brutally unattractive in the story) is an odd one at first glance, but the decision to show his flaws through personality made Depp the perfect man to nail this one. I've always thought that the contrast between Ichabod and the Horseman is an interesting one; Crane is a man who lives inside his head and seems bizarre to society, Horseman is a man with no head and strikes fear into society, and Depp certainly captures the quirky eccentricities and creates one of my favorite performances of his. Burton also showed his sense of humor through the casting, by picking out wildly charismatic men to play the leaders of the community (Michael Gambon and Richard Griffiths being the two best examples). Miranda Richardson also delivers a fantastic performance and almost steals the show. All in all, a wickedly entertaining picture that is sure to delight through and through.",Sleepy Hollow
168,p-jonsson,A decent enough evening flick,6,27 May 2014,"et us get this over with right away. I do not think Johnny Depp was the right person for playing Ichabod Crane. Maybe I am too influenced by seeing him in Pirates of The Caribbean but I just do not think he was the right person for this role. He really did not work for me. He is to whimsical and gesticulating to be taken seriously as a scientifically inclined crime investigator as far as I am concerned.Too bad since the story itself and the movie was quite promising. As is often the case with Tim Burton's work the movie has quite dark tone which I quite like. The various scruffy and suspicious characters that Ichabod meets right away as he enters the village inn fits right into the eerie atmosphere.Unfortunately Ichabod's inclination for science clashes with the rest of the story which is undoubtedly supernatural. It makes the movie not really have a distinct direction but instead waddle with one foot in each camp. I would have preferred if the movie either had gone all science and in the end Ichabod had exposed an evil but perfectly human adversary by scientific means or if it had gone all supernatural and Ichabod was an adept at exposing (exorcising) supernatural beings rather than a scientist.Having said that, the movie was still a decent enough evening flick and fairly enjoyable. The footage and scenery are well done as one would expect from Tim Burton. It is not exactly a special effects loaded movie but what is there is fairly okay, at least for a movie from 1999.",Sleepy Hollow

Still an amazing film, though. Could be the best looking Burton film - the cinematography is beautiful and the production design is without equal. Love the way the Headless Horseman was realized - simply a perfect representation - and love the inspired casting of Christopher Walken. The story could be a bit better, but the dialogue's great with just the right amount of morbid humour and the mystery element is welcome. Add in an expected solid performance from Depp, a great ensemble cast, and a terrific Elfman score, and you've got one of Burton's top three films.

Christopher Walken plays the ghostly rider, and the strong supporting cast also includes Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Gambon.

We are in the 19th Century in a time in where Sherlock Holmes were arising but were still seen as the enfants terribles. Johnny Depp aka Ichabold Crane is sent to some godforgotten town at where he has to do the research for some mysterious murders committed by the headless horseman...

All the murders are connected to the myth of the headless horseman, who cuts off all the victims heads.Once Ichabod arrives at Sleepy Hollow, you know there is more happening under the surface than just headless murderer. With red herrings thrown over the place, the mystery of the headless horseman and his murders becomes quite thick and entangled.If you are very accustom to Tim Burton films than you know what to expect. Like all of Burton's films, this is just visually stunning. The seedy greys create such a bleak and miserable atmosphere to great extent, giving the town and woods a very claustrophobic feeling. Burton's direction is flawless as usual, he is a master of his craft.Johnny Depp has created a great partnership with Burton, always giving a great performance. Depp handles the flaky yet over eager Crane with great fun. Ricci is perfect as the love interest, never overacting in places of danger. Gambon, Jones, Griffiths, McDiarmid, Gough all do well as the town elders.This is one movie where i didn't solve the ending. From the great script and plotting, this gives you clues, but never spoils the surprise. Which a find a welcome surprise. Most others you can figure it out before the end.

It's an amazing film, about one of my favorite classic tales. Sleepy Hollow tales place in the turn of the century New York City, 1899. Ichabod Crane ( Johnny Depp), is really ahead of his time. He is a New York City Detective who uses the latest investigative tools. He is summons to upstate New York to investigate 3 unusual murders, in the town of Sleepy Hollow. The victims all have been beheaded, and have a wealthy background. The locals believe they were all beheaded by a Hessian Mercenary from the Revolutionary War, ( Christopher Walken). Ichabod starts his investigation and doesn't believe the tale. One night seeing makes him believe, when the stable hand is murdered.Some believe the horseman seeks revenge for his murder, thus taking revenge on those that stole his head. While others believe it is the towns buried secrets involving the towns elders that have woken the horseman. He only seeks revenge on those responsible, including most of the wealthy.Sleepy Hollow is done well, in that gothic Tim Burton style. The movie has it all, comedy, scares, and a side romance with Ichabod and Katrina Van Tassel( Christina Ricci).

If you want to see an exact adaptation of the story, you will be sadly disappointed but if you're looking for a great horror film from Tim Burton, there is no way you will have any problem with this. I would say it's one of his best films.Ichabod Crane(Johnny Depp), an investigator sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow where a number of bizarre deaths involving decapitation have taken place, comes across Katrina Van Tassel(Christina Ricci), Baltus Van Tassel(Michael Gambon) and The Headless Horseman(Christopher Walken).

Tim Burton has become one of my all time favorite directors and this is definitely one of the movies that put him in that spot for me.

Washington Irving's original story follows Ichabod Crane (here played by Johnny Depp) a teacher living in a private town named Sleepy Hollow. He learns of urban legend the Headless Horseman who rides at night, lopping the head off of anyone he comes across and bringing them back down to hell as the sun rises. Alone in the woods one night, he comes face to face with the horror! This adaptation turns Crane into a New York detective with a very squeamish side who is sent to the town to give a scientific conclusion to this urban legend and unravel the mystery of the increasing murders happening. The film is sumptuously designed with gorgeous gothic style and imagery which is a real visual and thematic treat! What may also surprise newcomers is that it's also really funny in places; Depp is again fantastic in the lead role and brings an innocent boyishness to it, providing a lot of the dark comedy. The romantic subplot is explored well with Katrina Van Tassel being portrayed well by Christina Ricci; Crane's love interest throughout. Ricci is beautifully cast in Burton's world along with a host of great supporting roles from Christopher Walken, Christopher Lee and Lisa Marie as Crane's mother. If you are squeamish, there are sequences here that will be hard to watch including autopsies of decapitated bodies and a certain bloody kiss that Ichabod himself would find difficult to stomach! A fantastically moody Elfman score weaves throughout and there are certain horrific images that will stay in your head for some time; also beautiful ones such as the twisted Tree of the Dead. Cinematographer Emmanuel Lunezki drapes the visuals in luscious gothic mastery making it feel very much like a silent horror movie.

Directed by Tim Burton and starring the ever-versatile Johnny Depp as the New York City detective brought on the bizarre supernatural case, Ichabod Crane. The case itself is derived from a local myth and legends of a headless demon hunting humans. Depp's character Crane does not believe this due to his belief in logical explanations and uses his unorthodox gadgets to nail the case before the headless demon is on the prowl again.Burton nails the production and direction of this flick which has a flair of a Gothic and eerie tone which further enhances this supernatural atmosphere. In particular the mist that oozes through the town and extinguishes the lights during the night watch. Watch the scarecrow scene and you will know what I mean folks. The blood gore in this film is campy and over the top which I didn't mind at all. Depp's humour and quirkiness brings life to the character Crane and really shines in this film. His usual odd behavior in all the characters he has played gives the performance a different eccentric touch.

186,Silverzero,Dark and imaginative tale caught in genre trouble.,8,18 April 2003,"Another addition to Tim Burton's series of dim-lit but very entertaining movies, `Sleepy Hollow' isn't a disappointment. The subject is a headless horseman in turn-of-the-century era New York outskirts. Burton's style is perceptible in the gloomy yet deeply moody atmosphere. But the film isn't perfect. The main problem is the lack of audience that this would appeal to. While it is a bloody horror, this seems as though it would appeal to the young male audience. But with the `Dangerous Liaison'-esque atmosphere and periodic settings, this seems like one for the cinematic elite.
The film isn't a misfire and there are plenty of good things that stand. The costume designs and set pieces are very impressive and the visual effects are magnificent. But there are other things that decrease the positives. The dialogue is wooden and occasionally unconvincing. It works best as a horror and attempts at humour are laughably bad. But with a cast like this, you feel compelled to their every move, with Johnny Depp as the `Knight in shining armour'. Let's face it, he isn't suited to brawny action. In fact he must be the most effeminate superhero in the world. Unfortunately, he doesn't keep in with the audience and just doesn't cut it as the lead star. Luckily he is supported by a huge supporting cast, including Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Lee, Casper Van Dien, Martin Landau, Lisa Marie, Ian McDiarmuid, Michael Gambon, Michael Gough and Christopher Walken as the horseman himself. This endless amount of star-power well supports Johnny Depp in the lead and make the film all the more watchable.
With so many positives, the negatives are almost completely erased. Yes the dialogue may be shamefully clunky, but Tim Burton could do much worse than this. So overall, `Sleepy Hollow' is a minor success. 6.3/10.",Sleepy Hollow

When Crane arrives, he doesn't get a lot of cooperation from the locals even though they tell him that a ""headless horseman"" committed the vicious murders.  Plus, Crane is told that the horseman was a former Hessian mercenary, played by ""a very scary"" looking Christopher Walken. The performances (Depp, Walken, Christina Ricci, etc.) are great and so is the musical score by Danny Elfman and Emmanuel Lubezli's photography of the gloomy scenery.  I like the fact that director Tim Burton (""Batman"") doesn't let his screenwriters (Andrew Kevin Walker and make-up whiz Kevin Yagher) follow the same story as several other adaptions have done before this one.

Loved ""Edward Scissorhands"", ""Beetlejuice"", and ""Ed Wood"", and always looked forward to what came next.But in the past decade or so he's disappointed more often than not. His ""Planet of the Apes"" remake was an abortion, and ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"", while not terrible, didn't seem necessary or particularly necessary either. ""Sweeney Todd"" was a little bit better, but still didn't make me particular worry about having missed a couple of his more recent works. I caught up to one of those the other night though, and I'm happy to say that my fears were not (mostly) justified.""Sleepy Hollow"", first of all, has very little to do with the Washington Irving story which it is ""based on"" according to the credits. ""Inspired by"" might be more accurate, and the film takes equal inspiration from the works of Edgar Allan Poe (specifically his prototypical detective character, Dupin) and Hammer horror films from the late 50s and early 60s - going so far as to cast Christopher Lee in a small role at the beginning of the film.The cast is certainly a big, big part of the fun here, with such wonderful character veterans as Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Martin Landau and Christopher Walken all getting juicy (if generally small) turns in this story of a New York police constable, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), with ""advanced"" ideas being sent (more or less as punishment) to the small Hudson valley town of Sleepy Hollow to deal with a series of gruesome beheadings, in 1799. As the film develops, Ichabod believes there's a perfectly rational explanation for the murders, and it's to the film's credit and Depp's that as he gradually learns that in fact there is a fantastic, mystical presence behind them (Christopher Walken as the silent but deadly Headless Horseman), he continues to probe the secrets, never entirely giving up his rational belief system but also finding the ability to accept some of the religious/magical possibilities behind the horseman - while also coming under the spell of a young woman at the center of the horror (Christina Ricci).It's all quite beautifully shot, excellently acted with perhaps the exception of Ricci (one of those actors I can never really accept in period roles), who isn't really bad, and it's a wonderful mixture of comedy, scares and thrills, and a bit of the mystic. My only real problem with it comes in the ending, which is too much like a Scooby Doo ""aha, I've got you now"" episode; most of the film managed to keep me guessing at least a little bit but the finale is all too typical. Oh well; this is certainly one of the most pleasant surprises I've had in a while, and there's even some interesting stuff below the surface - the whole colonial/witch-haunted/Protestant New England of the 17th-18th centuries brushing up against the coming of modern science and the Industrial Revolution and secularism is quite expertly handled, though it never gets in the way of a good old-fashioned story. Really, loads and loads of fun and probably my 2nd-favorite Burton film at the moment after ""Ed Wood"".",Sleepy Hollow

The story, the setting , the music and the costumes were just absolutely marvelous.

It's not a true Horror movie. Heads do roll and there's an amount of blood, but it's underlined by epic music and not by scary one. The production is very 0815, looks like a ""the usual business"" movie.

The film tells of Constable Ichabod Crane who travels to the quaint village of Sleepy Hollow to solve the rash of murders by the Headless Horseman (Christopher Walken who is unseen for most of the film except for two flashbacks and the finale). The film is quite spooky for the majority of the film, but hardly a rated R movie. The only moments when that rating plays in is when the victims are decapitated on-screen. Johnny's performance is one that emasculates him at times in the movie, but he amuses me too.

Katrina (Ricci) is immediately drawn to Crane, whom serves as her love interest, while he searches for answers with his unusual techniques.While many of the minor roles are done by big names, this film is really Depp, Ricci and Walken (despite him being mostly headless). Ian McDiarmid, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths, Miranda Richardson, Michael Gough and Michael Gambon all put their personal touch on their characters while still being recognizable.I may not be the biggest Tim Burton fan, but he does have his good days. Sleepy Hollow is an example of one of his best. Tim Burton's influence is felt from the very first frame. That's not a bad thing, however, as the film needs a creepy tone to it. Disney's animated film was always one of my favourites as a child and this film serves the purpose of bringing the story to life completely.Sleepy Hollow is able to live on as a masterpiece of live-action. It's not great when it comes to the action sequences or when you look at the deaths in the film like you would in a '90s slasher flick. But the essence is in the plot and the characters that bring this story to life. That's where the true greatness of the film lies.Depp doesn't have to be the unsung hero in the film to win over audiences. Despite the good looks of Depp and Crane not really known to be attractive, Depp's portrayal is top-notch due to the mannerisms. He nailed the eccentric qualities, the squeamishness, the clumsy nature of Crane where you can believe that at any moment Crane will bite the dust too. Ricci is the audiences' reliable character for the expositions and for whom we can follow to know how the story progresses.With the limited special effects done by Star Wars' Industrial Light & Magic, an original set created and fantastic costume design, Sleepy Hollow hits a homerun on the first pitch. It's a fantastic film and must see for all since its truly one of the best films from the '90s and on the resumes of Burton, Depp, and Ricci.",Sleepy Hollow
196,zmaturin,"""Sleepy Hollow"" had me wide awake",9,20 November 1999,"Has Tim Burton ever made a bad film? Some are better than others, but none of his movies are boring, bland, or cheap. ""Sleepy Hollow"" continues his trail of excellence, and although it's slightly flawed, it's attributes far exceed it's draw backs. It's scary, funny, and beautifully shot.Johnny Depp is brilliant as Ichabod. It's been a while since such a flawed, unique character was the hero in a movie. Ichabod is scared, nervous, and confused, and stays that way. Depp is hilarious and touching. The rest of the cast is superb, and there are cameos by such luminaries as Martin Landau, Christopher Lee, and Christopher Walken. The film's main flaw is that there are simply too many great characters crammed into it to do any of the actors justice. Jeffrey Jones and Ian McDiarmid are never given scenes that cement their eccentricities, and Christina Ricci is underused. The convoluted plot line also gets out of hand, and the movie must resort to having a character have a long monologue explaining the whole plot (and even then things aren't clear).
One other complaint: Can we please stop having characters receiving a treasured object from another character and being told to ""keep it close to their heart"", only later to be shot at, letting the object stop the bullet? That gag's got whiskers on it!But these are only minor design flaws in an involving and visually stimulating film.

I had a really good time watching this, even if its a bit flawed I would still say that this is one of the best horror films from the 90'sA bit dull at times and the exposition scenes can be too long, however, these minor flaws do not ruin the whole experience. I would complain about the special effects at times, but I know they are cheesy on purpose, besides, most of the special effects are pretty great.A really good tribute to Hammer and Bava, it has some really good performances, a great mood, fantastic atmosphere, some fun gore scenes and stunning cinematography.A great horror gem.",Sleepy Hollow
198,Shiva-11,The Depp/Burton duo scores again,8,18 February 2000,"Sleepy Hollow: When the New York judiciary grows tired of a Ichabod Crane, an inspector who believes in justice of all things, they dispatch him to a small New England town to solve a series of ghastly murders.  What appears to be a routine investigation of a serial killer that likes to hack off heads turns sinister when it becomes evident that the murderer may not be human. First, this is not Disney's version of Irving's classic tale- it is dark, gory, and scary. Indeed it is not really Irving's story anymore, with several of the main details having been changed.   Finally, this version is extremely well executed (no pun intended).After such fantastic debacles as ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" ""The Astronaut's Wife"", and  ""Mars Attacks"" it is a pleasure to see Depp and Burton back together again.  Depp is wonderful as Crane, the, pale, skittish, intelligent man of few words (you might call him Ichabod Scissorhands) trying to uncover a killer as he tries to understand his own past.  Ricci, meanwhile, is enchanting, as the mysterious seductress and leaves you wondering - is she good or evil?  And Walken is darker than he's ever been - a man whose dedication to evil and killing actually brings him back from the dead.  But acting alone does not make a movie.Burton masterfully translates his vision to the screen, creating an atmosphere that is spectacularly gloomy, oppressive, and enticing at the same time.  In addition to fabulous sets, and great action sequences, the film is remarkably well paced with no wasted scenes or downtime - I was amazed how quickly it was over.   I will be adding this to my collection!",Sleepy Hollow
199,fjhuerta-2,"Dark, but sweet",7,23 September 2001,"Another great Tim Burton movie, Sleepy Hollow is a great re-telling of the Ichabod Crane story. This movie, in fact, reminds me strongly of another Halloween feature by Burton: ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"". The main difference here is that, while in ""Nightmare""  there are no villains or heroes, just characters in search of their identity, Sleepy Hollow has a villain, a quirky hero, and lots of action. But they both have something in common: they are sweet, lovable films. There is something about Burton, indeed.Another thing worthy of mention: the cinematography is masterfully executed. How could they capture such a range of hues with such a dim light is beyond me. A great movie. A classic for all coming Halloweens (back to back with ""Nightmare"", if possible).",Sleepy Hollow

Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci in the leads, lend their solid performances with the gloomy settings. The inisde jokes were good relief, in the midst of the gruesome plot. There was at least a few good references (wink-wink) to the 1958 Disney telling of this story, as well. The supporting cast was also quite good, with Jeffrey Jones, who always lends his best in any picture I've seen him in. The cameos, including the legendary Christopher Lee, were fun. Add Christopher Walken, who chew up a scene as if it were mincemeat, and we've got some great inspired casting. He clearly relished his role. Good for him! The music score by Danny Elfman was outstanding. Overall, a good pcture. The only drawbacks I encountered was the story twists started becoming predictable, and that resolution seemed pretty weak. A rather lackluster wrap up, to an otherwise exciting outing.",Sleepy Hollow

This could even have been a good family movie, but no, they had to throw in all the ketchup to scare us. Well, it didn't scare me, it disgusted me.Aside from the excessive amount of blood, this horror film is not bad. Some scenes really are frightening, like when he finds all those heads in the tree and when he meets the dead sister. What sort of disturbed me was the romance between him and the girl, it was really boring and very cliché. What i did like about it (the movie), was that it was very unpredictable, i could never guess what would happen next. Sometimes Danny Elfman's score was too loud, especially in the opening credits. It almost deafened me! Cinematography was very good, great costumes, great overall look.
If you like these kinds of stories, i guess it's worth seeing, but you have to know a little bit what it's about, or you'll be confused!(one more complaint: the ending was too exaggerated and farfetched when compared to the rest of the movie)",Sleepy Hollow

203,Indy-52,I have a few problems with this film,8,3 July 2001,"although the film has basically a good story and some great visuals, its narrative style can be quite confusing at times. At the end, I was confused about more than a few things. The story isn't told in a very clear way. Ichabod's weird dreams distracted me from the story. I also didn't like the way the Horseman was turned into a sort of henchman. Who really cares about who is ""controlling"" him? This wasn't supposed to be a detective story, I think. I don't mind a bit of plot in my horror films, but here is an exceptional case where we don't care who the killer, and it doesn't really matter either. And what's with the mistreatment of animals and children? What was the point of the lady cutting off the bat's head and pouring its blood in a boiler? Or the cutting of the crow's leg by Katrina? There are several things about this movie I will never understand (I've watched it about five times). How come so much damn blood comes out of the dead widow's body, for instance? And what was the point of the evil eye business? And why does everyone always say ""pardon my intrusion"" (it's said about four times in the film). Why did the Horseman's axe ""melt"" in front of the church? Almost everything that happens in this movie is weird. Much of it probably doesn't even make sense. This is one of the most infuriating movies I've ever seen. But the blame isn't on the director, who does the best possible job of bringing the incohesive script to the screen. It is obviously to be placed on the screenwriter and the editor, who seem unable to create and understandable narrative. Still, with all these flaws, there is also much to admire in the film. Johnny Depp is a pleasure to watch, and young Marc Pickering makes an impressive debut as the poor young Masbath. It is also a very imaginative film, with director Tim Burton continuing to show his talent and originality, but next time he should pick a better script.

He says maybe a total of five words before he is unnecessarily killed off.  He does not even serve as a red herring, because no one could believe that he is the supernatural murderer.My guess (though I am not totally sure) is that Tim Burton liked the image of the headless horseman hurling the jack-o- lantern at Ichabod Crane.  That was a nice dream sequence, but it was completely unnecessary to this film.However, since the film seemed not to know what it wanted to be, an alternate explanation is that this started out much closer to Irving's story, but got transformed along the way.",Sleepy Hollow

Ichabod Crane, an investigator who uses his logic and reasoning, sets out to stop the so-called headless man. The film also adds vibrance and color to the story, adding more mysteries and shocking twists.The most thing I'm impressed of is the set. It's so hauntingly beautiful, watching it is like being in a dream where you're lost in a strange land. There's so much quirkiness in this movie, and it works. I also love the characters, they are given so much depth. Tim Burton's characters in all his films always have that outsider-vibe about them. We begin to know why Ichabod acts the way he is and we sympathize with him, even the real villain has a backstory on why he/she is so evil. The story is wonderfully told, and there are some shocking surprises, especially the villain being revealed. Well, in most mysteries like Agatha Christie, the least possible person who could've done it is actually the main antagonist. The villain just lurks around, we think he/she is just a tertiary character or something.I really love these kinds of films.

And Johnny Depp even does a convincing job acting, although his support cast, especially Ricci, was not as good.One nice touch was that, although there were many special effects they did not stick out as they normally seem to in such movies.  This is probably because even the scenes that were ""real"" had a skewed reality.  And for once the reality was consistent throughout the film, so the suspension of disbelief was not difficult.I do have two complaints, neither of which detract from the movie itself. The first is that this is not an authentic retelling of The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  Amoung other things Icabod Crane was supposed to be a school teacher, and a firm believer in the occult (and it actually gets worse from there)...  But if you haven't read the story you won't miss it (much like if you never read Dracula before seeing Bram Stoker's Dracula).  The second complaint is the use of Christopher Walken.

On his arrival, the town council informs him that the three victims were killed in open ground, and the heads had disappeared - taken by a headless ghost that is supposedly responsible. Ichabod is unconvinced of this, but learns more about the ghostly horseman - it is the ghost of a Hessian sent by the British during the revolutionary war, and he was caught by redcoats and decapitated with his own sword. When Ichabod sees the ghost kill one of the town council members, his skepticism evaporates - and he soon discovers that the horseman's ghost has an unholy connection to Balthus Van Tassel, a wealthy farmer - and whose daughter Ichabod is falling in love with...I knew this film would be good before I even got to see it well for starters, its a Johnny Depp-Tim Burton collaboration who has made several films together and almost all of them, quite impressive. This one is another one of those impressive films by said collaborators.

They did it with Edward Scissorhands, Ed Wood and Sweeney Todd. This film is no different.

That however was my views a few years ago and after re-watching Charlie And The Chocolate Factory, which also has Johnny Depp and Tim Burton once again teaming up, it got me thinking that maybe i should give Burton's films another run in the park as most of them i only viewed once anyways. Well the first one that i saw and hated was the movie here in question that being Sleepy Hollow. I knew the general storyline from of coarse having seen it before but also from the timeless Halloween story of Ichobod Crane and The Headless Horseman.Needless to say this was a ' 2 times a charm' sort of scenario cause i was actually was quite surprised how quickly i got into this film. For those of you who haven't seen it or know nothing of the time old tale in storybooks, Ichobod Crane (Johnny Depp) a very timid (yet always acting braver then thou sort) is sent to the eerie little town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders that have a certain serial killer feel to them as the killer's tag seems to be lopping off of their heads and taking them with him as unusual trophies. Crane is soon to learn that a majority of Hollow's townspeople generally believe the be-headings are result of the famed Headless Horseman. Crane doesn't believe any of this of coarse that until he has a run in with the famed killer himself.Glad i re watched this as i am now in love with Burton for not only his directing style but also for the fact that his backdrops and sets for the different scenes are so realistic and gloomy (From what i hear a lot of Burton's own Gothic rituals are the reason this is so) He is definitely a master of his craft bringing a lot of age old stories to life through visuals and CGI. I have also noticed he seems to like working with actors that he has used in a lot of his other works as well. A stellar cast included in this one such as Christina Ricci (Who i find personally very underrated) who plays Katrina Van Tassell, Michael Gambon (Baltus Van Tassell) and last but not least(in a non speaking role) the always great Christopher Walken (as the fabled Hessian Horseman) Walken's performance is the best in this film as they have his teeth filed down(not really of course) to emit razor sharp fangs add some eerie contacts in his eye also incorporating his own wild styled hair and the end product is quite a belieavble Horseman (the scenes when his head is on of coarse)An enjoyable film that just certified that i should be reviewing a lot more of the Burton films i originally had a distaste for!!",Sleepy Hollow
209,RhapsodyReviews,"Great Film, One of Tim Burton's Best.",8,7 October 2019,"Review:
'Sleepy Hollow' is an American gothic-supernatural-horror film directed by Tim Burton. It is loosely based on Washington Irving's 1820 short story 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. I'm not the biggest fan of Tim Burton movies, so I went into this movie with low expectations and I'm so happy I did. I enjoyed with movie so much, there is nothing better than expecting garbage and getting an entertaining story.
In 1799, New York City police constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is dispatched to the upstate Dutch hamlet of Sleepy Hollow, which has been plagued by a series of brutal decapitations. Ichabod begins his investigation, skeptical of the paranormal story, until one night he sees the Horseman behead one of his victims with his own eyes.
First and foremost, this is a stacked movie when it comes to high hitters in the British acting community. Not only do we get the talents of Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci being the two leads of the film. We also get the amazing Michael Gambon, Richard Griffiths and Jeffrey Jones as some side characters playing towns folks, and Christopher Walken as the Horseman. The acting felt very 'play like' and that's not a bad thing at all. I loved how it felt and came together, it worked with the type of movie this was.
From the very beginning of this movie I knew I was going to be in for a treat because of the cinematography. The camera angles that are used in this movie and the color play is incredible, they take chances that not a lot of film in this age would try being said to be a gothic genre. The story is also very tight, by that I mean it didn't have any filler scenes. Everything that is on screen is necessary to the story.
Overall, I was personally very surprised by this one. It is classic Tim Burton being a gothic story and having Johnny Depp of course, but it was a dark tale before he got a hold of it and it wasn't ruined with changing the story like he does in a lot of his films.

210,Meredith-7,"Gothic, romantic & gory..what more could you ask for?",8,15 January 2000,"There really has not been a film like this in quite a while. Its definitely a Tim Burton film, it has that darkness and obscurity that typifies most of his films, but it also manages to tie in a love story with old fashioned good vs Evil. Its just fantastic. The photography and set design is just amazing, its visual stunning to the eye and also ties in so well to the story.  There is quite a bit of gore, fairly similar to the type of gore in films such as reanimator, Evil Dead etc- its a real horror, but a horror/comedy/romance all rolled in to one. The story in its entirity works really well, it takes a while for the whole plot to unravel, but it keeps all of us guessing. Johnny Depp is in fine form as is Christina Ricci. Its thoroughly enjoyable and i definitely recommend this to anyone who likes things that are a bit darker than your average film.",Sleepy Hollow
211,arthurclay,Pretty decent horror,7,30 June 2005,I felt that at times throughout the entire movie that Tim Burton was being his deliberate just plain gross self which does bother me. There was no need to go completely overboard just to impress the younger horror crowd but he did and there you have it. Johnny Depp was good and the rest of the cast was the same. It also does not have much to do with the original story so if you are looking for a carbon copy of the old Disney classic keep looking you won't find it here. Icabod Crane is called upon to investigate a series of deaths in Sleepy Hollow and begins to suspect that the young daughter of Van Tassel is more than involved. The headless horseman is also an obvious suspect as everyone's head keeps getting cut off. A good twist ending is mandatory and is duly delivered. I may watch this one again sometime lord knows when that will be but I won't mind when I do.,Sleepy Hollow

3) The dynamic that Crane is a man ahead of his time, with far more advanced methods of detective work than what was normal in 1799, adds a very interesting dynamic to the film

His dark style, present in a great part of his films, is just amazing and magical. Talking about magic, he is able to pass it to the audience in each of his films. In ""Batman"" and ""Batman Returns"", he adapted very well the story of the man of shadows in Gotham City, what didn't happen in the two Joel Schumacher films. ""Edward Scissorhands"" is one of the most magical and sweet films of the '90s. In ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"", Burton did an inventive and weird animated movie. In ""Ed Wood"", maybe his best film to date, he could do a biographical story at the same time controversial and hilarious. And ""Mars Attacks""... Well... It's his weakest film, but still that rather enjoyable. To repair this small mistake, he wonderfully adapted an old American tale- ""Sleepy Hollow""- and did his great comeback.""Sleepy Hollow"" tells the story of Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a New York detective who believes only in what he sees. He goes to a small village in order to investigate some strange decapitation murders. The inhabitants claim that they were commited by a weird creature who is part of the folk of the place- the 'headless horseman'. Crane, of course, doesn't believe in anything at first, but a childhood trauma and a romance can help him with his mission. I won't tell more things about the plot, because I don't want to spoil your surprises, and so that the film gets more enjoyable and intriguing to watch.It is difficult to say if ""Sleepy Hollow"" is Tim Burton's best. It doesn't have the sweetness of ""Edward Scissorhands"", or the ingenuity of ""Ed Wood"", but it is a very special film. It is original, dark, with a strange black humor and sometimes scary. If I had to define the genre of this movie, it would be fantasy. More than comedy, horror, mystery. Because, in the deep, it is beautiful- and don't forget there is a romance! The acting is fabulous, specially Depp and Christina Ricci- one of the greatest promises of Hollywood for the future. Its dark, wonderful cinematography is definetely Oscar-worthy, and so are the costumes, the art direction, the special effects and the make-up effects.""Sleepy Hollow"" can be not of the 10 year's best, but it is one of the most enjoyable, exciting and entertaining films of last year.So prepare for some scares, much fun and a great twist in the end. HEADS WILL ROLL...8 and 1/2 out of 10",Sleepy Hollow
216,LuboLarsson,Great film,8,10 November 2002,"I've never been a big fan of Tim Burton's films, so I didn't expect to enjoy Sleepy Hollow as much as I did. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are great in the lead parts, and the film looks amazing. I strongly recommend this film to everyone, even if like me Tim Burton's films have failed to bowl you over in the past.",Sleepy Hollow
217,Doc_Who,Better than the classic Disney animated short!!!,7,19 November 1999,"This movie is a update of the classic story. But in this movie, Crane is a cop sent to Sleepy Hollow to solve some unsolved murders. Crane moves in with the Van Tassell while working on the case. Eventually headless bodies start appearing and the horror of the ""headless horseman"" come out. The story of how he lost his head is shown in a flashback.The horseman is played by Christpher Walken(Blast from the Past). The costumes are excellent as the setting.It seems that everyone in Sleepy Hollow is related to each other. Crane eventually discovers who is controlling the horseman. The cast is great as you can never tell who is friend or foe. This movie is better than the classic Disney animated short as it gaves us time to deal with life in Sleepy Hollow, it's people and it's deadly secrets!!!If you like Johnny Depp,Christina Ricci or the other cast you might like this dark take on the classic story!!Or if you like any of Tim Burtons other movies check out his take on the classic horror story!!BTW, the town of Sleepy Hollow does really exist in reality!!!Go see this movie and have  a fun time!!Forget the critics who hate this movie!!At least it's better than Disney's short !!!!",Sleepy Hollow
218,peacham,"Chilling , Humorous and Well Paced.",7,29 November 1999,"Sleepy Hollow offered very few disappointments. The Direction was slick, the mood intense, and the performances for the most part,consistently good. Johnny Depp owes the development of his career to Burton,each film he has done for the director has revealed a finely tuned performance. his comic timing as Icabod Crane is well polished. Christina Ricci fares less well as Katrina. the role is a thankless one and she never really tries to act it. Delightful support is provided by the wonderful 4 town elders played to perfection by Ian McDiarmid (Star Wars evil Senator/Emperor Palpatine),Michael Gambon,Jeffrey Jones(Amadeus's Emperor Joseph),and Michael Gough (of Hammer film fame). I would have liked to see these men have more screen time but it was worth losing more of them to Christopher Lee's great pre-credits cameo. Christopher Walken and Miranda Richardson also provide fine support as the Horseman and the haughty Lady Van Tassell respectively. This is by no means Washington Irving's Sleepy Hollow, it is Tim Burton's child and shows all the traits of its brilliant parent. do not try to compare the two they are seperate stories altogether. Both are well worth the visit.",Sleepy Hollow
219,abooboo-2,"More like ""SLOPPY Hollow""",4,23 September 2000,"All dressed up with no place to go. Sure, Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" is absolutely gorgeous to look at, but the script is cluttered and perfunctory and there is no suspense at all. A great disappointment. This version takes a practically foolproof story and tells it badly. It astonishes me the way viewers will so frequently be duped by movies that look ""cool"" but have no substance, no vitality, no reason for being. The plot is by no means ""complex"" as some other comments have asserted, it's just badly confused. There is no sense of mystery, no sense of awe of the supernatural that made Washington Irving's source material so timeless. There is none of that here. Instead, we yawn as a series of poorly drawn, interchangeable characters get their heads lopped off by the leaden, mechanical horseman - a villain about as scary (as depicted here) as Prince Charles riding around playing polo at night. Then, once you see him without his horse, lumbering around in pursuit of victims on foot, you really have to scratch your head. How can Burton not know that the Horseman has to always be kept somewhere in the shadows and on horseback to function as a legendary ghoul and the stuff of nightmares? You put him right out in the open and he's as common and scary as a tax collector going door to door.The cast is mostly uncertain. That is the thing that stands out the most in bad movies: the uncertain, purposeless look on actors' faces as they struggle to find their characters' motivation; something, anything to grab onto. Christina Ricci does a lot of that here. She simply looks like someone who isn't quite sure. The child actor Marc Pickering as Young Masbath, Ichabod's young protege, fares even worse. Burton was obviously looking for someone (who looks quite a bit like he himself must have looked as a child, incidentally) with an unschooled quality, but one always gets the uneasy feeling when the boy's on screen that he's just as likely to wander over to some piece of film equipment and inquire ""What's this do?""Burton favorite Jeffrey Jones? Stands around in the shadows during his brief time on screen waiting for scraps of boring exposition to be thrown his way. Caspar Van Dien? Completely wasted as Bram Van Brunt, who should be Ichabod's romantic rival for Ricci's affections and dark antagonist, but cluelessly marginalized here. Miranda Richardson, one of the most highly regarded actresses of her generation? Amazingly, she gives a terrible performance, with contemporary sounding line readings that are totally out of sync with the time period (1800).Then there's Johnny Depp as Ichabod. At least he is trying to have some fun with the part and doesn't sleepwalk through it the way he did so maladroitly in ""The Astronaut's Wife"". The prissy mannerisms, the always slightly ruffled air - there is a texture to his performance that at times fits nicely with the film's fetishistically textured visuals. This helps for a while, but he is ultimately hobbled by the weak, unimaginative dialogue he is too often given to speak and a character so diluted and distorted from Irving's original that his Ichabod appears to the audience as irreconcilable fragments, not a whole.I had wondered last year why this movie, which had such an enormous opening week, dribbled to a final U.S. take of only around $100 million. Now I see why. Bad word of mouth. In film after film after film these days, with their bombastic soundtracks, schizophrenic editing and overheated direction; I form the same image in my head as I'm watching them self-destruct in front of me: that of an incompetent clown flubbing his juggling routine badly but smiling out upon his audience just the same with all too eager eyes.",Sleepy Hollow
220,vasco_cid,Perfect crime/mystery historical recreation all the way.,10,3 May 2001,"If you are a crime/mystery story lover, than this is the movie for you. The movie tagline `Heads will roll' may seem a little excessive and may suggest a movie full of gore. Truth is that this movie is essentially  a detective story' where everyone is a suspect, and the gore part come as a complement, it is just the style of the killer, who kills his victims the way he was killed, fast and painless. Constable Ichabod Crane, from a NYC in the late 18th century, is given the mission of investigating a group of homicides said to be committed by an headless horseman. These crimes are taking place at the small town of Sleepy Hollow. As soon as Ichabod Crane arrives at Sleepy Hollow, he is told the story of the headless horseman, and how did he lost his head. For those who haven't seen the movie, the mystery may seem to be the real identity of the horseman, but it isn't, the mystery relies on who controls the horseman by keeping his head (as the horseman's identity is revealed in the beginning). As crimes happen, we discover that the horseman doesn't kill by random, he kills those that the very person who keeps his head demands him. Says detective's prime rule everyone is a suspect, and consequently the guilty is the less evident' Sleepy Hollow, fulfils this rule completely, furthermore, all those details seen throughout the film, have a certain explanation that is revealed at the end. Tim Burton once more share with us his most comprising view of the script and he makes us feel that we are really there and we are part of the story. Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en) writes a beautiful horror/romance fairy tale with Christina Ricci as its princess and Johnny Depp as her knight. Movies like this one, with this crew are to come!I rate it ------- 8/ 10",Sleepy Hollow
221,Kirasjeri,Tremendous fun and great atmosphere.,9,19 November 1999,"Director Tim Burton has added to his excellent and stylish body of work with a captivating adaption of Washington Irving's classic story. This film is marvelous; if there is any fault with ""Sleepy Hollow"" it is that it requires a viewer to pay attention to the plot - which is all the better for thinking adults. Movie-goers of any age will find something to love here, although be sure to keep the kiddies far away unless you want wet beds and sleepless nights: ""Sleepy Hollow"" gets off to a rousing start with two decapitations within the first few minutes.Instead of a timid skinny schoolteacher, Ichabod Crane is a New York City policeman in 1799 specializing in scientific ""detecting"" of crimes; he is soon sent to distant upstate New York in the heart of an isolated mostly old Dutch community - Sleepy Hollow - where murders by decapitation are occurring with distressing frequency. Crane, rather officious and slightly diffident in his own way, goes to the town that rises out of the misty smokey air in a hollow reminiscent of Brigadoon in the Scottish highlands.Crane soon discerns the conspiratorial nature of the leading townsmen, and that the Headless Horseman is indeed continuing his nighttime rides in search of heads. He is the incarnation of a bloodthirsty Hessian soldier from the Revolution killed by Americans in the woods that no one dares set foot in twenty years after he and his cut off head were buried there. The very logical Crane needed to see the town magistrate killed in front of him before he'd believe in the Headless Horseman.Soon Crane is striking up a bit of a romance with the daughter of a leading (and suspicious) citizen, Katrina. But there is more here than at first seems - much more. Clues of witchcraft use keep appearing and they point to her. A mystery begins to develop with many of the pieces discernible for the truly observant. The link between the conspiracy and the Horseman eventually gets pieced together, but only partially as a final twist leads to the climactic and heart-pounding conclusion.The plot holds together and develops very well. Fascinating clues and red herrings are sprinkled throughout the film; disjointed plot bits also all fuse together by the end with great effectiveness.  The art design and scenery is superlative and Burton knows masterfully how to create the right mood with his cinematography. The special effects are first rate, but Burton uses them judiciously merely to enhance the plot and emotion of the moment; this is thankfully not an ""effects"" movie. Depp is appropriately rather dazed and sometimes befuddled as Crane, although he rises to the occasion at the end. Ricci is vulnerable when needed, and the rest of the cast is effective too. Noteworthy is Christopher Walken in a non-speaking role as the Horseman and horror vet Michael Gough as a doomed notary.The movie ends with a beautiful snowy shot on Wall Street in January of 1800, and it is so accurate the original Federal Hall is on the right and the second Trinity Church is in the distance just across Broadway. The look of old New York is splendid. ""Sleepy Hollow"" is wonderful in every way, including such details that make one want to see it again.",Sleepy Hollow
222,rooboy84,Loved it.,8,30 October 2002,"*Spoilers* I thought i would enjoy it, but not as much as i did. Really, there isn't that much gore, mainly violence.

223,pekinman,More from Burton's bag of tricks,7,24 September 2009,"'Sleepy Hollow' is right up Tim Burton's alley and he's made a visually beautiful and gripping film of it. I'm not sure why he decided to make Ichabod Crane such a wuss but Johnny Depp's interpretation of the character has charm and mild pathos which make for a rounded believable character and displays Crane's queasiness about blood and decapitated bodies without making him a city sissy. The cinematography is the most beautiful in any of Burton's films, all sepia and silver-toned grays. I'm not sure how much (if any) of this was filmed in the Hudson Valley of NY but it certainly looks real enough in the outdoor scenes. The studio sets are obvious enough when Burton's signature gnarled, beast-like trees start popping up in the landscape, and as usual the sets are just as beautiful and fascinating as the spooky woods surrounding Sleepy Hollow.Elfman's scores are always great enhancements to Burton's films and this one is one of his better and more hard-hitting compositions, but still with the charm of boy sopranos and eerie violins at the top of their range.The cast is stellar, as in full of stars, English mostly, who will be familiar to film buffs who watch a lot of BBC and Masterpiece Theatre as well as feature films from the U.K. They are all so good that none stand out above the others. Unfortunately Christina Ricci, as the romantic heroine, is not up to the same level simply because she's too modern in her delivery. She looks great but she delivers many of her lines in a quick and robotic manner that jars after so much eloquence from her colleagues, occasionally speaking so fast that she slurs her words together and is almost unintelligible if your not listening closely. But she is not exactly a detraction, simply a cut below the others. I'm still waiting for Burton's perfect nightmare legend to hit the screen. The upcoming 'Alice in Wonderland' looks like it is animation so I don't think it will be the ONE. Sometimes I think Burton might do well to do a couple of remakes, like the Invisible Man or Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, or maybe even Dracula... ALL with Johnny Depp!This is a very good movie but not for young children. The blood and chopped heads are typically Burton-style and not sickening but the abundance of both do have a cumulative effect, especially as its a veritable blood bath at the end.Not one of his greats, those kudos go to 'Ed Wood', 'Edward Scissorhands' and 'Big Fish', but it is one of his better films, and the visual aspects of it are splendid.",Sleepy Hollow
224,Snowgo,"Crazy, Gratuitous Violence",6,11 May 2014,"I am being a little generous by giving this move 6 out of 10. An otherwise perfectly respectable performance by Jonny Depp is spoiled by.., everybody's head getting chopped off. All through the movie, one-by-one, all the townspeople have their heads chopped off. Maybe they know why it's happening, but the people watching the movie don't. Why should we want to see decapitation after meaningless decapitation? What, precisely, is ""...a Hessian"", anyway, and what has it got to do with the people of the town? Good literature has rich symbolism. What does a headless horseman mean, symbolically? I'll admit to not having read the book, but this movie is just more inane, gratuitous violence. I found the story neither rich nor comprehensible.",Sleepy Hollow
225,possumopossum,This Movie Should Have Been a Sequel,8,24 February 2007,"This movie told an excellent story. My only complaint about it was it wasn't true to the original story. It should not have been called SLEEPY HOLLOW. Even though the original story is short, I think there is enough material in it for at least an hour-and-a-half feature film. There is a lot in the original story that could be fleshed out a little more by a good screen writer without making it drag too much. This movie would make a great sequel to the original story. It would have been better if they made the original story into a movie, called it SLEEPY HOLLOW and made this one a follow-up sequel. Remember, in the original story, it is not clear what happens to Ichabod Crane. A bit of gossip is relayed that he left Sleepy Hollow and became a lawyer or something. This movie could have been called SLEEPY HOLLOW 2, THE RETURN OF ICHABOD CRANE.Just a thought. The movie taken on its own terms is very good, as long as you can get past the fact that it doesn't have much to do with the original story. 8 out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow

227,rundbauchdodo,Burton's finest to date!,10,6 January 2000,"I've just seen Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow at the first Swiss press screening and I'm absolutely delighted by this thoroughly stylish movie. I can hardly wait until it.In Sleepy Hollow, Burton combined all his skills to create an original, though classic blend of horror, fairy tale and even fantasy. But it is undoubtedly a work mainly for adults, in contrast to some of his earlier films (e.g. Batman, Mars Attacks). There are quite many gory scenes that also make this film great fun for Splatter freaks (I proudly admit that I am one). Sleepy Hollow delivers and kicks other recent horror films you know where (especially the terribly overrated The Sixth Sense).NOT TO BE MISSED! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",Sleepy Hollow
228,Don-102,"Does Not Capture the True Spirit of Irving's ""Legend"", But Still Mildly Fun Anyhow.",7,21 November 1999,"Director Tim Burton's hands are all over SLEEPY HOLLOW, a century-ending update of Washington Irving's classic ghost story of a headless horseman who terrorizes a small New York town.  The story is set in 1799 and even uses some quips about the coming of the 19th Century to tie it together with our time.  Its visually delicious, sometimes chilling, but unevenly odd and bloody.  Heads sure do roll and the murders are surprisingly displayed as bloody massacres, all beheadings considered.SLEEPY HOLLOW is fun.  There is no doubt about it, however Depp is mis-cast and the screenplay is amazingly thin.  The appearances of the headless horseman are not done as well as Burton is capable of doing.  Sure there is mist, vapor, and howling winds.  We are never truly scared by his attacks. They are brutal to say the least.Burton's villain is reminiscent of ""Batman"" in appearance sometimes and he, of course, uses Depp as ""Ichabod Crane"" as his own alter ego.  Do you ever notice Burton's main protagonists look like Burton himself (EDWARD SCISSORHANDS, ED WOOD, even BEETLEJUICE)?   I like the small doses of Burtonesque filmmaking, but a full length feature it cannot make.  Danny Elfman's (another Burton regular) exciting score adds much to the sometimes dreary flick.  Depp never seems entirely comfortable as ""Crane"" and more humor was needed to flesh out his character.Its funny how some people complained about the early BATMAN films not being cartoonish enough, only dark and even depressing.  Here is a dark picture literally that may have worked better with a more cartoonish touch.  I know this is horror but isn't the original spirit of Irving's ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" more colorful and comical?  Yes and this picture needed more spirit and less schlock.An important note: SLEEPY HOLLOW contains one of those scenes that make you want to split - when the ""bad guy"" tells his or her venemous story about how they were able to reak evil verbatim, leaving less to the viewer's imagination and more lines of dialogue.  Why not run some title cards explaining it all?  These points must be thought of, but I must say SLEEPY HOLLOW is fine, simple entertainment from a master filmmaker who I thought would provide a lot more.Rating:  **1/2",Sleepy Hollow
229,dirtychild,Sleepy Hollow isn't a sleepy ride!,8,12 May 2006,"Sleepy Hollow is director Tim Burton's take on the classic story of the ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" (aka the Headless Horseman).As you would expect from a Burton film - it is Gothic, darkish with a splash of camp (no thanks to Johnny Depp's performance!).The story centres around a New York detective who is sent to investigate the beheadings of three people in the village of Sleepy Hollow. He soon uncovers a murderous, headless ghost which his scientific background can't explain.Sleepy Hollow is an exciting film - the headless horseman sequences are completely electrifying. They are instantly recognisable (I probably had nightmares as a kid remembering that headless horseman crossing the bridge) and totally engaging - as the ghost proves himself as an unstoppable force on the townspeople.That said - where the film sort of falls down is it's ""head rolling"" plotting. It is sometimes confusing to try and make sense at all the plot twists and developments - although things are reconciled by the last 20 minutes (it all makes sense).Overall - Sleepy Hollow isn't a sleepy ride - brimful of headless delights...",Sleepy Hollow
230,jamhorner,A Very Poetic and Visual Masterpiece of Film-making,9,12 July 2007,"I have to admit, again, I was 30-years-old when this came out it scared the life out of me. I know Tim Burton's work but this was darker, scarier and bloodier. Such a awesome and interesting twist on the classic Headless Horseman of Sleepy Hollow tale. The story is pretty much the same: Ichabod Crane travels to Sleepy Hollow to investigate supernatural beheading that lead to the headless horseman. But there is a surprise twist.What makes this movie work is Depp's convincing perception of the meek and geeky Ichabod Crane. His character is scared, funny and extremely intelligent. It was such a perfect role for Depp. The other characters, Jeffrey Jones, Christina Ricci, Michael Gambon, Casper Van Dien and Ian McDiarmid are all fantastic in this movie, a real work of art. But the applause should go to Christopher Walken for playing the headless Hessian. The acting was outstanding.Aside from that, the scenery and the set design was mind blowing. It brought the Gothic vision of the story into a new level of horror. The fog, the Tim Burton-like scarecrows, the offbeat windmill, the Tree of the Dead, the bridge and the houses of Sleepy Hollow were spectacular to see. It was very reminiscent of Burton's Nightmare Before Christmas.The scare factor was there and it was both the bloody scare as well as the ""jump-out scare."" Some of the elements of these factors were scary themselves. I can't tell you much about the scary points because that would reveal too much plot detail, but I can tell you that it is scary. Take my word.The only downside to it was a too predictable relationship. Aside from that it was an outstanding movie. A true piece of poetic film-making.",Sleepy Hollow
231,Mr. Pulse,A good looking flick,8,18 November 1999,"Last night I saw sneak preview of Sleepy Hollow, and I was not disappointed, and I suspect fans of Tim Burton won't be either.  But this movie is not for all tastes.  There is a lot of head-lopping, as one might expect, and it can be somewhat gruesome.  Of course, being a Tim Burton movie, it also has quite a bit of dark humor, and while I loved it, some might not get the joke.Visually, Sleepy Hollow is fantastic.  Burton has completely recreated 1799 Sleepy Hollow.  The Horseman effects are top notch and there are some very exciting action sequences.  And I don't want to give away any of the fun, but the use of the color red in the movie is great too.So be wary if you're faint of heart, but otherwise it's a lot of fun.",Sleepy Hollow

It is much more. This is a brilliantly done retelling of an old tale, masterfully told and beautifully presented.The original Washington Irving story is still there but with some new twists. For example, Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, was a schoolmaster in the original and he's a detective here, but it works.Christopher Walken is appropriately menacing as the Hessian Cavalryman who becomes the horseman and Richardson is tinged with just enough evil to be interesting. Christina Ricci is fetching and mysterious as a young lady interested in Crane. Her portrayal is as outstanding as she is beautiful. The remainder of the characters are excellently cast. The casts performances are tight and true to the story throughout. Casper Van Dien as Brom Van Brunt is surprisingly good as well. Van Dien has a fight scene with the horseman and Crane (Depp) that is a striking and outstanding example of action and how it should be executed for maximum effect. I have to say here that I went into the theater expecting to be disappointed with the special effects after seeing the trailers. I was wrong. This film came alive in this telling and the effects were flawless.My favorite aspect of the film, however, was the sets, lighting and the overall mood Burton and Emmanuel Lubezki, as cinematographer, accomplished here - it really mesmerized me.

The casting is great with a lot of well known people, Johnny Depp does a great performance, and Christopher Walken is hamming it up in this but I love it, anything he does is great. This film is an obvious love letter to classic horror films such as the hammer Dracula or Frankenstein pictures, with references going as far back as the 1931 Frankenstein. The plot concerning who is behind the headless horseman killings is a little contrived and confusing, especially towards the end, but that's one small flaw were as the rest of the movie is almost flawless.

236,DoctorSkyTower,MUCH BETTER THAN I THOUGHT,9,17 January 2000,"Saw the trailers for this previously. Was not too impressed. We see the Headless Horseman so I was immediately under the impression of: oh, so that's the story then. Hack, off with your head. However, after seeing this, I was proved wrong. I like a bit of humor, as these sorts of flicks that take themselves too seriously often end up hideous. The sets were like outdoor versions of the House in the Haunting. Astounding, beautiful Gothic Forest! But by gosh the Horseman knows how to throw his sword around! The sword-swinging scenes were awesome. He was actually played by the stunt man who was Darth Maul in THAT movie. Impressive! Sword fights get 10/10.Although a flick directed by Tim Burton, who seems to love making movies out of children's fairy tales, this one is most definitely not for the children. The Tree of the Dead was a particularly frightening example - especially when Constable Crane chops and hacks at its roots and blood begins to spew out. What comes out next... well, I don't want to put in too many spoilers!!I don't have many negative views, probably the only minus would be one too many heaving bosoms... take for example Crane's mother. Most of her scenes seemed focused on her bosom and nothing else. CONCLUSION:  If you are squeamish, you may want to give this a miss, there is a lot of blood and gore. However, I still give this excellent flick 9/10.",Sleepy Hollow
237,walsh-22,Another successful collaboration of Depp and Burton,10,29 April 2007,"The story is set in 1799, Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is a policeman in New York City who is different from his colleagues, he is far ahead of them in using science to solve crimes and not just using inhumane methods that the police in this time favour. His superiors send him to an isolated farming community called Sleepy Hollow where a series of gruesome murders have happened, victims have been found without their heads. The town council members tell Crane that a headless Hessian horseman is responsible for the crimes but Crane doesn't believe them and thinks it is a person alive who has killed the town's people but his beliefs are soon tested when he witnesses the headless horseman killing the Magistrate (Richard Griffiths). Crane carries on and finds a conspiracy that has been going on with the town council members who are now being killed and Crane must find the horseman's head to stop the killings.Tim Burton immediately sets the mood of the film by making it very dark and Gothic which he always seems to be very good at doing. Danny Elfman helps Burton's direction with his music which just adds to the tension in the film.One of the things I like about Johnny Depp's character Ichabod crane is that he is not your stereotypical hero, he is completely different from any other hero you have seen on film before. He is not macho, he is squeamish, he faints and is very eccentric compared to everyone else but it is only Depp that can make you watch a character like that and not be turned off by his feeble qualities. We see flashbacks of his traumatic childhood where his father was this fearsome man of God and his mother was a free spirit who was murdered by his father because he saw his wife as an evil witch.The film keeps you guessing till the end. There is the secret that connects all the town council members and the victims of the horseman, the audience find that out in the middle of the film but it is also who is it killing the town's people? Is it an evil spirit or someone who is using the headless horseman to get their revenge on these people? There is misdirection about who it is, Burton puts a red herring in that it is Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) till we find out at the end, it is Katrina's stepmother (Miranda Richardson)who wanted revenge on the Van Garrets and Van Tassels who threw her family out and the people who stand in the way of her getting what she wants.What is good about the end is Depp at the beginning of the film starts off as a loner but at the end of the film he has a family, Katrina and Young Masbeth (Marc Pickering) who share two things with one another, they have no living family left and have witnessed the events of Sleepy Hollow and who can never tell anyone else as they won't be believed especially in that time so can rely on one another as they have bonded over the horrors they saw in Sleepy Hollow.Another interesting part of the film is that Crane uses science techniques that are unheard of in that era the film is set but it shows him as someone who has a modern approach to solving crimes, very much the way they are solved today. I have never seen this before in a period film and I think it was a good touch to show how brutal life was before the science techniques came into force and how people were bullied into signing confessions using brute force and torture back in the past.The cast are amazing. Christopher Walken scares the bejesus out of me in his make up and looks so menacing as the headless horseman.The special effects blew my mind, especially in scenes where it looks like a character has actually been decapitated and the scene where the horseman gets his head back and you see all the veins, tissue and skin building on the skull till the transformation is complete and you are looking at Christopher Walken, back from the dead. The writing by Kevin Yagher/Andrew Kevin Walker just makes this Ichabod more better and interesting than the other films which have featured the Crane character. I would also like to mention the Cinematography by Emmanuel Lubezki and Film Editing by Chris Lebenzon and Joel Negron who just helped to make the film first rate.",Sleepy Hollow
238,SimonD1900,Vissually fantastic. And a alright movie over all.,6,7 April 2020,"A good movie, clearly was made with a a focus on the visuals. It won an Oscar for its visual style and set design, which it deserved. I would say that acting is fine as well, or even really good. Just a bit cartoonish characters. In fact the entire movie is a bit cartoonish, it almost have this Disney feel about it, besides the gore. I mean the action and gore scenes are fun, but a bit over the top, even if it's perhaps the most fun parts of the movie.The movie is visually very good with great set design and art to it. But it's badly cut at times, just jumping into scenes with no explanation why the characters are where they are or how they got there. And story not fleshed out, it becomes silly, too unrealistic. Also a bit wierd how Deep's character first is this pragmatic realist who only believes in science, but swiftly becomes an expert in understanding and figuring out all the black magic and witchcraft behind the horseman. Also, what was the thing about his flashbacks to his childhood, is that suppose to tell us something? Okey, he has a dark past and doesn't like the church, so that's why he's a nonbeliever and a detectiv? Is that really necessary information? Seems it was more about the visuals.The humor is kind of fun but still, it's not that fun. I don't think it should be a comedy, wierd mix. Some might like it. I didn't find it that appealing. Couldn't really find the tone of the movie, is it suppose to be a comedy, a kids movie, horror movie or a thriller mystery? Maybe it's suppose to be like a mix of all those things, since it's based on a classic horror fairytale. It's kind of a horror story for kids. So in that regard it's depicted right. But is that the purpose? And what about the gore? I mean, it's kind of extreme for small kids (not the worst but still). Don't know what rating this movie got.Still, I would have liked it more if it had a more serious approach with not so cartoonish characters. Instead taking the story very serious, trying to be realistic even if in reality it's unrealistic. And that it focused more on the mystery and creepy element of the story. Also the psychology of the characters, to really understand what's behind their decisions and behavior. Instead of art design, quirkiness and strange artsy flashbacks. But then again, visually it's an alright movie and the gore is fun and story not extremely bad, executed well for what it is. An alright movie. Wouldn't really recommend it though, only to teens or someone who's into goth art style or something (but I think a person like that would already know about this movie). Again, it's an alright watch. It's Tim Burton, what would you expect?As a kid, this was one of my favorite movies. Haven't seen it in many years. Gave it a watch reasently, since I bought it on blu-ray. It didn't really hold up to me. But still, it's alright. Visually it's fantastic. It's definitely better then Alice in Wonderland at least.But if I want to be visually stimulated, I would look at drawings or play a video-game. From movies I want to be told a good story first hand. But hey, that's just me. Not a bad movie, just that I would want something more or something else I suppose.",Sleepy Hollow
239,Sparrowmaniac,The Best Horror Movie After A Long time.............,10,24 January 2005,"""Sleepy Hollow"" has to be one of the best horror movies that I've seen for a long time. The story has been brought to life by excellent camera work and mind blowing cinematography. Tim Burton does another brilliant work directing this movie, securing his spot as one of the best directors in present day Hollywood. Also the veteran Francis Ford Coppola comes back from 'retirement' by being the executive producer for this big budgeted movie. The visual effects are stunning, and the dolby surround sound makes the regular cinema goer feel like he is back to the mysterious village of Sleepy Hollow. The background music is also very soothing, and it sets the tone for the movie.The movie could have turned into ""The Exorcist"" fame of horror but Johnny Depp uncanny knack of being creative in front of the camera has turned Detective Ichabod Crane into some sort of Comic Relief. But this relieves the tension greatly as the dark and foggy village creates a sense of utmost mystery and drama and makes the viewer believe that something terrible is about to happen.......Christopher Walken, though barely has any lines to say in the entire movie he is concrete and is superb through his body actions, re creating the terrifying Headless Horse man a.k.a. ""The Hessian Horseman"" Michael Gambon is also very good as the Landlord Van Tassel, and young Christina Ricci portraying the young witch, the love interest of Johnny Depp steals the show away from Miranda Richardson, the evil witch plotting to take away all the gold of old Baltus Van Tassel, even at the expense of her rich husband, step daughter and her own flesh and blood, her sister. The movie can be a bit graphic at certain stages especially during the murders but overall, if you watch this in a movie theatre it is bound to give you the creeps, and it will make you feel jittery for a loong time. Overall 10/10..........",Sleepy Hollow
240,MovieLuvaMatt,"Interesting mix of horror, mystery and comedy",7,22 June 2003,"""Sleepy Hollow"" is another score for Tim Burton.  The eerie, surreal style of uniquely Burton.  The film has a good storybook quality to it.  Nobody should take the film too seriously, as it isn't meant to be a realistic period piece.  As Burton mentions in the commentary, ""I never thought one day I'd be directing a movie where people would be dressed up like George Washington.""  The blood looks like red paint and the sets are obviously stylized.  Simply look at it as a dark fantasy, and you should have a good time.  The performances are great all-around.  Johnny Depp never disappoints, as he brings much dimension to the character of Ichabod Crane. The film has a good sense of humor, and Depp uses the humor to his advantage.  Character roles like this are tailor-made for Depp.  The creepy Danny Elfman score nicely sets the tone.  And I enjoyed the final plot twist.My score:  7 (out of 10)",Sleepy Hollow
241,Tashtago,Overly Brutal,4,25 July 2005,"Sleepy Hollow is the beginning of Tim Burton's downfall. As others have said the movie is way way too brutal. How many times do we have to see people's heads get chopped off? It would have been much improved with less head rolling and a little more suspense. The acting is a times non-existent instead of being terrified the townspeople (Ricci and the boy in the graveyard scene react as if they've just seen a squirrel crossing a field.) Depp is funny but lightweight and the movie is very very set bound and looks and feels artificial which may have been the point but it would have been far creepier if shot on actual fog bound locations. Instead of being scary the gore just becomes tedious and in the end I found myself fast forwarding to the resolution. Burton followed this with Mars Attacks also terrible and Planet of the Apes which is perhaps the worst remake of all time. He's rebounded somewhat with Charlie and the Chocolate Factory but still has a long way to go to win back the respect I had for him early in his career Bettle Juice, Edward Scissorhands, and Ed Wood.",Sleepy Hollow
242,albechri,Wide Awake,8,19 May 2000,"It is Tim Burton in more realm style. A bit like Edward Scissorhands with Ed Wood style. The story actually a bit similar with the X-Files, an unsolved mystery, hidden crime, and supranatural matters... Trust No One... But here, Tim Burton, still with his favourite actor, Johny Depp presents more mature ways of movie story telling. The casts are played strict to their characters, and even Danny Elfman score seems more mature, not playful as Mars Attack! or other Burton-Elfman scores, but makes bigger score this way. The effects are usual (for this time), but to be noted, some interesting appearance from Martin Landau, Casper Van Diem, and off course Christopher Walken. Very impressing. Christina Ricci, again after Beetlejuice plays a character which has an attraction to witchcraft. But this time she was covered by Johny Depp strong plays. The picture are beautiful. The Production Designer really do well here. And the cinematography are equal to them, and able to intrepert the story and moods needed. Outstanding movie destined to be another Tim Burton's classic.",Sleepy Hollow
243,GuyCC,One of Burton's Finest Works,9,27 November 1999,"The more I see it, the more I like it.""Sleepy Hollow"" is one of the most visually beautiful (and bloodiest for Burton) films that I have seen this year.  It's dark, moody look almost seems like a black and white film that only has a few splashes (which in some ways, ""splashes"" is very accurate) of color throughout.  Danny Elfman has provided yet another wonderful score, and sets the tone of the film perfectly.Without a doubt, Johnny Depp's performance makes the movie.  He's arrogant, eccentric, intelligent... and a bit cowardly and squeamish.  He's not the typical ""hero"" that you find in so many films (although he does fall into the definition a few times), and his performance is both comical and memorable.  Great uses of humor through the film to counteract the scary scenes.A great cast rounds out this film with plenty of cameos from Burton's past films to his own personal favorites.  Initially, I wasn't sure what to think of Casper Van Dien, because every time I see him, all I think of is ""Starship Troopers"".  Regardless, he pulled off the character of Brom well.I liked the mystery of this.  A lot of reviews have criticized the story as being weak, but the mystery was large, and all of the loose ends were resolved.  It's actually pretty impressive despite the complex plot twists thrown about.Tim Burton's movies always have that ring of nostalgia or high camp.  The references to the Disney short were undeniable, as was the seeming ""bat wings"" behind Christopher Lee.  Burton is so underappreciated as a director.This is an excellent ""Burton fan"" film, or for anyone who likes a good horror story.  For Burton, it ranks up with my personal favorites such as ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" or ""Edward Scissorhands"".",Sleepy Hollow
244,dskywalker0,Stunning film,8,28 February 2021,"I love the creepy vibe, the intensity of this film, another one that's wonderfully weird. The mixture of creepy figures, such as headless ghosts and witches, and goth vibes makes the perfect scenario for the well-written plotline. The story is entertaining, it's a very typical film of its time, but with a touch of darkness that only Tim Burton's work can have without it being absolutely tragic.",Sleepy Hollow
245,kneiss1,One of the most atmospheric movies of all times,10,8 November 2010,"I have seen this movie 11 years ago in the cinema. I loved it back then, and became a huge Tim Burton fan. I wasn't sure if I'd still like it 10 years later - but I do. It's one of the most atmospheric movies of all time. While the story can't be taken serious, it is very entertaining and keeps you interested. Actors are amazing, everyone fit perfectly in their role. The set was beautiful. For the eye, there hasn't been the slightest flaw. (But some Computer - effects that can't hold up to todays standards.)I can't see any real flaw in this movie. It could have been a bit more serious and a bit more scary. But it's actually fine as it is: with a few comedic elements and a ""wiking eye"".",Sleepy Hollow
246,ernesti,A masterpiece,10,19 September 2004,"In my opinion , Sleepy Hollow is one of the best Hollywood movies ever made.It's stunning mix of horror,action and drama. It has the epic story, the best acting, the best set of characters, a very intense atmosphere which makes you see nightmares! If you want to see a good movie, then rent/buy this, because it doesn't underestimate its viewers.Some sensitive people might not want to watch this movie, because heads'll fall!

247,paulo20,One instance where the effects actually make the movie,8,13 December 1999,"This is a gorgeous film, such that it hardly matters that the story is perhaps a bit faulty.  Story, as I said, scarcely matters.  Whatever story there is is enough to hold the movie together and maintain minimal interest.  Sleepy Hollow is a very visual film.  The costumes were great, the sets of New York and Sleepy Hollow were amazingly authentic and the effects so awesome, that I scarcely paid attention to the story or even to the notion there was supposed to be one; I was too busy marveling at the spectacle of the Headless Horseman and other remarkable effects.  This is one film where the effects actually make the movie (Jurassic Park was another such film as was The Lost World  - marginally).  There was also a surreal, quirky feeling about the film that I rather enjoyed.  There's even a sequence that is reminiscent of the Disney cartoon.This film is also about legend, i.e. elevating and expanding the status of the legend of the Headless Horseman to the status of the (hackneyed) vampire and werewolf and doing a damn good job of it.",Sleepy Hollow

249,Gambitt,beautifully done,7,7 May 2001,"I can't think of anyone better than Tim Burton to do this movie.  No one can create moods and atmosphere in a rich, fantasy realm like Burton. 
All in all, Sleepy Hollow was a great film.  The set is exquisite.  Depp is lovable and hilarious as an intelligent, goofy, somewhat arrogant Ichabod. Altogether, everything comes together to make a great action/horror/comedy flick.Viewers should be advised, however, that the plot is actually quite thick. You have to really watch for details to keep up with the mystery plot. This can be difficult to do with so many other distractions in the movie.",Sleepy Hollow
250,Mattswife97,GREAT MOVIE TO WATCH ON HALLOWEEN,10,30 April 2002,"This is a great movie to watch along with the Halloween movies around Halloween time.  The scenery in the movie is cloudy and gloomy; dead trees, leaves on the ground, no sounds of nature. The best part is when the horseman went in and out of the Tree Of Dead.  I just had to watch that in slow motion(I suggest you do the same). The only thing i didn't like is how you didn't really get to know the names of the characters because they didn't say their names that much and they got hacked to death. I also love when Icabod first comes into the house and Christina Ricci is blindfolded dancing around singing ""The Picatine Witch, The Picatine Witch, Whose got a kiss for the Picatine Witch.""  I could watch this movie over and over on gloomy days.  I gave this movie 10 stars out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow
251,gothicgoblin1334,Another outstanding Burton film,10,30 May 2006,"It really reminds me a lot of Hammer films, it's dark overtones and imaginary backgrounds, a truly well-made film. With Johnny Depp and the beautiful Christina Ricci (love her) Burton crafts a genius film that even though is not a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel, it has its' own agenda with dark and macabre horror. Some very frightening moments, not for the squeamish. For those of you that find this film empty, I think you should really look in a more realistic point of view rather than judging. Christopher Walken does an acceptable role as the headless horseman, even though his lines are only ""HA!"" it gets amusing after a while yet I don't really find his character boring or wasted at all. Johnny Depp does another film which shows he can do anything. The beautiful and darkly mysterious Christina Ricci lands a great role in this movie, Miranda Richardson does a fine job as well as Christopher Lee who seems to be back to acting~ Many surprises along with well-done Tim Burton twists, and finally, a solid 15 rating in a Burton film. Bravo Tim Burton!",Sleepy Hollow
252,Criticalstaff,A cult classic horror film,8,6 January 2021,"The real talent of Tim Burton is the ability to blend horror and endearing sweetness.
I like this movie, it is very unique. I am amazed how grounded the whole plot actually is. It remains throughout a murder mystery and a detective story. Onto which, Burton grafts this dark twisted fairy-tale. A fairy-tale in reverse: a horror story. It is the type of stuff parents would tell their children when they refuse to eat their vegetables, but it is geared towards adults. It works brilliantly. At least for the first two-thirds of the movie.It starts off, as a murder mystery set in Early National Period Middle Colonies. The movie keeps these two elements: the faithfully accurate historical setting and the murder mystery that explores the town's social structures throughout the film. Yet early on, it introduces supernatural horror devices. That stuff is uniquely Burtonian. It is somewhat satisfying how he twists whimsical fairy-tale tropes into horror. Which in turn is supported by terrifyingly terrific visuals. Tim Burton's style completely ascribes to all the definitions of the word ""Awe"". That is good enough to support even his lesser movies. But, here there is enough restraint on the weirdness coupled with the murder-mystery plot that keeps the whole affair grounded and enjoyable.The movie is very simple but everything is executed perfectly. Visually it is haunting and dreadful. Normally I would dislike a movie that soaks in the same colour palette, but here it is used on purpose.
Everything is grey and moody. The forest is simultaneously dense and desolate. The cinematography, except in a few key scenes, creates this sense that the clouds are low, like there is a ceiling at all times. It reinforces the feeling of being trapped and of inhospitably.The acting is good. Johnny Depp was not yet the superstar he became afterwards, he gives a very convincing sincere performance. It is almost refreshing. The rest of the cast play heavily into their respective stereotypes, but I felt Miranda Richardson really gave that little self-aware touch that makes great villains.Overall, it is a very good film although I was a bit disappointed by the third act. When the movie goes full-on fairy-tale nightmare and resolves the plot. These elements don't mesh as well when you break them down. For instance, the Witch murders some of the victims herself, when she could have the Horseman do it. It was established that was the whole point of the Horseman. Also, the windmill action scene looks very cartoonish. Ultimately, it works and the scene of the Horseman's bride is as terrifying as it should be. However, it contrasts a bit too much, in my opinion, with earlier parts of the film.This film instantly became a cult classic despite the fact that it might be a bit too awesome/awful for mainstream audiences. But, there is nothing really like it, and it is a great display of the power of cinema, an excellent use of film to tell a story.",Sleepy Hollow
253,poem,An absolute must-see,10,14 March 2000,"This is a fairy tale which should make you shudder. Instead, one often has to laugh because it is so funny. The acting was marvelous, even in the smaller roles. The movie had also very much style, it looked dark and dusty all the time. I loved it.I was a little bit nerved for I had to look at a handsome guy (Johnny Depp) all the time, even if he acted very good. And I didn't understand why the character of Mr. Depp, Ichabod Crane, often knew what to do, even if he believes in science and logic and had to fight against spiritual things. But that are of course not real arguments against this movie.I believe this is an absolute must see. But prepare yourself to see many heads cut in this movie !",Sleepy Hollow
254,WilsonLau,A beautiful movie,9,23 November 1999,"I always wondered why Tim Burton stopped making the Batman movies. They always looked so cool. Well he has really outdone himself this time. In Sleepy Hollow Burton has done an incredible job. Every scene is so detailed, so colorful and very breath taking. It also has the usual Tim Burton gore with nothing held back. Well written, well acted and very well done. Johnny Depp did a great job as Ichabod Crane. I did find it strange that they casted Christina Ricci because she is just a little too young for Depp to put it lightly. Well all in all this movie combines great storytelling, acting and beautiful scenery and is a must see. I really enjoyed it.",Sleepy Hollow

The dialogue is dumb. The back-story is BS. The thing moves as slow as molasses. The tone shifts between horror & comedy do not work. At all. The ""Oh Look! More RED Blood!"" is so over-used that it makes an intelligent person just shake his/her head. And how the heck did Sleepy Hollow NY turn into fog-bank central?

But I was stupid to say that it didn't look good, because this film is instantly a modern-day classic. It would also probably be in my top 5 films of all time. It is just so entertaining, engaging, enthralling and exciting that I couldn't resist it. I give all my praise to the people who worked on this film, particulary Johnny Depp, Tim Burton, Andrew Kevin Walker and Christina Ricci. In every area this film is absolutely perfect, the visual effects are stunning, the costumes are eye-opening, the sound is chilling and the editing is noticeably full of effort.

What I would say is see all the killing again and again and again.This is what started to make people think he should do more horror movies like this.Movie by movie of his is making him the best director.I hope when you see this movie you will start to like his films.",Sleepy Hollow
258,MadBadMovieman,Headless Horseman goes camping.,5,3 December 1999,"A new twist to an old tale.  And yet Another unusual Tim Burton film. The special effects were great and aside from some scenes of splashing blood, very real. It seemed Tim couldn't decide how he wanted Johny to portray the main character.  One minute decisive and specific. The next he's a wimpering, scared indecisive child. He figured it all out but getting there was a stretch.  You wonder how he could be a NY Constable. Christina was beautiful, well spoken and fit her part. Christopher Walken was as always a first class wildman. Most scenes I don't think he was really swinging the weapons but some looked like a real swordsman was and others seemed like graphic effects.  Either way, the Horseman was the best part of the movie.
Might watch it again on Satellite but not PPV.",Sleepy Hollow

I am usually a sucker for Tim Burton films, but this one left me feeling as if I missed something.  I don't know, maybe it is Depp's acting.  Anyway, on the good side, I did like the look of the film.  Burton rarely gets the look wrong even in his bad films.  And, the story is not bad.

Ricci is one of the rarest beauties of our time.  She can be light and dark, hot and cold all at the same time.  Watch this movie and you can't help being enthralled by her.The movie as a whole was really good.  Tim Burton has done it again!  The movie has EXCELLENT cinematography.  The only thing that I may have done differently is I would add some more cool Headless Horseman murder scenes. This could have been the absolute best slasher movie of all time with some work.  The death sequences here were all very creepy and different from those done in other horror movies that have come out lately.I'd rather see this one than the Scream series any day of the week.  Please Tim Burton (if you are reading this), make a sequel of two of this flick. But in the sequel give us die hard horror fans some more death scenes. This is one of the best concepts for a horror flick of all time...Jason Vorhees, Freddy Krueger, and Michael Myers have nothing on the Headless Horseman!",Sleepy Hollow

It of corse follows fairly closely the story of which the movie was named after, but the atmosphere is like something you've never seen. Thoughout this movie you never see sunlight, but it takes you though a dark fasinating world of great visuals. It's a scary movie as well, with effective suspense and good headless horseman special effects. Johny Depp's performance was very good as the interesting Icobad Crain. The only thing I really didn't like about this movie was Christina Ricci, who's character is very flat.Tim Burton has done some good movies like Batman Returns, the Nightmare Before Christmas, and Edward Sissorhands, but this film tops them all. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece but it's pretty close. I give this movie an 8 out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow
262,krumski,A triumph for Tim Burton,7,8 February 2000,"I've always admired Tim Burton's abilities as a visual stylist - his movies always have a unique and totally off the wall look - but I've never been truly satisfied with him as a director. His inability to tell a clear, focused story - or to get anything out of his actors except over the top performances - or to stage action in anything but a perfunctory manner. . . have always made him suspect to me. I felt his promotion to the rank of director was unwarranted - that he should instead be making his living as one of Hollywood's most in demand cinematographers or production designers.Having seen Sleepy Hollow though, I'd definitely have to say that Burton has made considerable progress. His distinctive visual touch is still present, though he has reigned in some of his wilder extravagances in order not to overwhelm the story. His ability to stage action sequences is much improved, resulting in some truly hair-raising chases and fight scenes (you're left to wonder what his Batman films could have been with this new found talent). Furthermore, the relentless jokiness which usually undermines his movies has been replaced by a brooding and operatic tone which better fit the story. For example, the flashback sequences here provide some of the most haunting and poetic images Burton has ever created - and they feel sincere, as if they come from a very deep and genuine place inside the filmmaker, and are not just flung at us to dazzle and tickle us with his visual ingenuity.All of which is not to say that Burton is no longer any fun. It's just that he has put his humor into better perspective. There are many nice wry touches in Sleepy Hollow, none more so than in Johnny Depp's truly outstanding performance, which straddles the poles of absurd comedy and genuine heroism. Even as we come to feel for Ichabod Crane and to admire his steeliness and pluck, we are never far removed from laughter at the character's prissiness and squeamishness. Depp walks a real tightrope act here, and it will probably not be to everyone's taste. I thought it was one of the best performances of the year, and represented a perfect marriage between Burton's tendancy toward campy theatrics and his newfound maturity and grace.Some caveats: Christina Ricci is not used particularly well here; her part is too blandly written to give her prickly screen persona much room to breathe. Too bad, as she would make an ideal Burton heroine (I hasten to add that every other single actor in the movie - including Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and yes, even Christopher Walken in a wordless cameo - is solid). And what's with this story anyway? It's a pointless bastardization of the original tale. While it's true that the original is pretty threadbare, it is certainly suggestive enough that a writer could spin out compelling backstories and elaborations without having to resort to coming up with a completely new murder mystery plot (which is kind of overplotted and confusing, anyway). But, taken on its own merits, the script certainly works well enough, and anyone not familiar with the original story won't notice anything amiss.Ok, now that I've said all that - the real reason to see this movie. . . those decapitations! The advertising slogan was ""Heads will roll"" but never in my wildest imagination could I have guessed with what frequency and in how many different kinds of ways. Burton eschews realism or gory details here, and instead goes for a stylization that is at once giddy, horrifying and strangely beautiful. The fact that each decapitation is played slightly differently - either in how it's shot or how it's perpetrated - keeps it from becoming routine and, indeed, every instance of it involves some new kind of twist or surprise. Some may say Burton is sick for focusing so much attention on this aspect of the story, but this is the Headless Horseman after all, and Burton's courage in not backing away from his grisly deeds gives the monster his full due. Although I wouldn't call the film frightening exactly (that is, to anyone but the most absolutely faint-hearted), it is suffused with a powerful sense of  creepiness and dread that prove extremely effective.All in all, a very enjoyable movie, and a signal of even better works yet to come from Tim Burton.",Sleepy Hollow
263,Funky A,One of the best films of 1999,9,13 January 2000,"Sleepy Hollow combines having fun and seeing a intelligent film. After all, it's a Tim Burton film. It is really a beautiful film(every image looks like a painting). Also, It is wonderfully acted(Johnny Depp is excellent). The story, although simple, is still very well written. I think that this movie almost has it all. The only problem might be in the ending. It is not bad, but you want to know more. This is a feeling that I get after seeing almost every Tim Burton film. Maybe it's because I love them sssooo much. If you have read my Batman reviews, you may have a feeling of déjà-vu in the following lines. This director made the most stylish movies of this decade. As opposed to most commercially successful directors, he really has a style of his own. I really love his movies.

264,funky_cherry86,The Legend Lives On,9,25 April 2005,"I'm a fan of classic horror films and after watching Sleepy Hollow it became # 3 on my top ten list of scary movies director Tim Burton took Washington Irving's timeless story and created a mythical yet mysterious tale with a new twist. In the original version Ichabod Crane, was a schoolteacher and now he's a constable investigating grisly murders. Johnny Depp is an amazing actor who played the role of Ichabod very well and Christina Ricci was beautiful as Katrina his love interest. The rest of the cast did a superb job making the film a smash hit.The year is 1799, Constable Ichabod Crane (Depp)of the New York City police is sent to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a number of bizarre deaths. Each victim has been found with their heads cut off, he stays at the home of Baltus Van Tassel (Gambon) and there meets Katrina Van Tassel, (Ricci)a beautiful young woman with ties to the supernatural. Mr. Van Tassel along with several other town elders believe that these deaths were caused by the headless horseman (Walken) who was a Hessian mercenary seeking revenge for his death twenty years earlier when his own head was taken. Ichabod thinks that there's no such thing as a headless horseman but as the bodies continue to mount up he gets serious and discovers there's much more to the story than meets the eye. When members of the Van Tassel household get killed he suspects the lovely Katrina with whom he's in love with is responsible. But it turns out that her wicked stepmother Lady Van Tassel, (Richardson) controls the headless horseman commanding him to kill people who are to blame for her misery. It's a race against time as Ichabod, Katrina and young Masbath (Pickering) try to stop the headless horseman and bring peace back to the once quiet town.For fans of horror I recommend watching Sleepy Hollow it's a thrill",Sleepy Hollow

There's nothing here we haven't seen (and heard) before, time and time again.Pros:  corsets and cleavages.Cons:  just about everything else.Sorry fans, it's just a big old predictable yawn from start to finish.  The narrative meanders, the dialogue is tedious and forced, and the whole construction is based around a series of mood shots rather than any actual plot.  It's uninvolving, it's formulaic, it's overly smug, it's just plain *dull*.And accents...  yes, there are some decent attempts at 20th century psuedo-plummy English, but the thing is, people in England in 1799 were talking like Yosemite Sam.  Do try and keep up.",Sleepy Hollow
267,MWNiese,Visually Appealing Burton Style,7,18 January 2009,"Seven out of ten stars Admittedly, I am an admirer of Tim Burton's darkest work, and ""Sleepy Hollow"" definitely falls into this dark category. ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a plethora of visually appealing Gothic effects. The costuming, make-up, set design, traditional special effects, and CGI effects all add up to a very satisfying spectacle of Burton Gothic styling. ""Sleepy Hollow"" was a visual candy store indeed.For those of you that aren't interested in Burton's Gothic styling, you simply are not going to appreciate this Burton film. Burton essentially carries this picture on visual effects, which is enough for me to find this film to be an enjoyable, if not a light weight horror film. I don't think anyone can completely write off a film that pairs Coppola and Burton on the production end.There were many many talented people involved in the making of this film on both the production and performance ends. Watching Christopher Lee and Christopher Walken is worth the price of admittance alone. Eflman's score is chilling, a soundtrack I wouldn't be ashamed to add to my own collection. The extensive list of talented professionals should alone signal to us that this picture is at the very least a quality mainstream Hollywood production. I personally can't ask anymore from Hollywood than a film such as this.There are however, definite shortcomings that preventing me from awarding ""Sleepy Hollow"" ten stars. The accents the actors used were uneven at times, some the characters even appeared to lose their accents in several cases. I just felt like the accents could have been handled better. Without taking the time to name specific actors, some of them simply suffered from marble mouth syndrome. I mean I couldn't understand what the heck was being said by specific actors. It was annoying, it's called annunciation people. The plot was conceptually strong at it's core, but just got muddled down in way too many unnecessary details, doing nothing to enhance the overall story. It's not that the plot was overly complicated, it was just riddled with ridiculous turns that forced Burton to have a few too many, ""Plot Explanation Scenes"". A truly intelligent film allows the audience to completely piece things together on their own; I don't think that would be possible here. The weakest part of the plot hinges desperately upon a woman exacting revenge upon her landlord for evicting her family many years ago. Whatever....The flashbacks involving Crane's childhood were quite pointless and some of the attempts at humor, I thought were miserable. The strongest aspect of this production is it's visual style and power, Walken and Lee are a joy to watch, and you can really never go completely wrong with Burton and Coppola working together. This would be a wonderful film to view as part of your yearly Halloween celebration, but I wouldn't take it too seriously.",Sleepy Hollow
268,samgiannn,"""Sleepy Hollow"" is good, creepy fun",7,19 September 2015,"Tim Burton put his own spin on the classic short story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" with the surprisingly good 1999 adaptation Sleepy Hollow. In the movie adaptation, New York detective Ichabod Crane must travel to the mysterious Sleepy Hollow in order to solve a series of murders that took place there, but realizes the town's dark history and the legend of a headless horseman might be the true culprit. Sleepy Hollow is essentially a highly stylized slasher flicks. There are lots of gory decapitations set against a fittingly Gothic tone, and although it's never truly heart-poundingly intense, there is a great atmosphere and some creepy imagery. Burton does make this movie a bit darker than his previous films (at the time), but there's still a bit of humor in its heart, mostly because of Johnny Depp's role as the Ichabod. Even though it deviates significantly from its source material, Sleepy Hollow is a fun, atmospheric movie",Sleepy Hollow
269,keihan,Burton outdoes Irving by a country mile (or maybe two)...,8,23 February 2000,"At the risk of sounding somewhat heretical to the purists who decry adaptations as inferior product, I cannot claim much affection for Washington Irving. As I was talking to a friend of mine who is a literature major, we both agreed that Irving had a lot of good ideas, BUT his execution of them sucked. I've always found him too wordy, too meandering, and too coma-inducing to be considered interesting (and I've read more classics in the last five years than I did the entire time I went to high school). So, this said, it would have to be Tim Burton who would get Irving's most famous tale right.While I'm not a fanatical Burton follower, I do have a great deal of respect for his craft and films that many of his detractors lack and I think that I can safely say that this is probably the most serious film of his that I have ever seen. That may sound strange considering the fantastical elements of this story, but unlike previous Burton efforts (and I include the original Batman on this list), Sleepy Hollow feels more grounded in reality, even if more than a few historical liberties were taken. The mystery of the decaptations, which I expected would be rather quickly resolved (after all, practically everybody in America knows who did it, right?), surprisingly turned out to be central to the plot, which I felt was a good move to give the story a solid backbone. However, it is not a mystery in the traditional sense that the audience can figure out the clues with the detective. Burton does drop a few subtle hints that you're likely to miss because THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT HE WANTS YOU TO DO. It seemed to me as though he wanted the audience to follow Ichabod's thinking, deductions, and conclusions rather than veer off on their own, thereby adding to the shock when the real culprit is revealed. Such a style requires subtle, painstaking work and it's to Burton's credit that, in my case at least, he succeeded.For all it's decaptations, blood, and somber atmosphere, the story does take a few Burtonesque touchs of humor that you can't help but at least smile at. My favorite has to be during the flashback to the Horseman's death (played with over-the-top relish by Christopher Walken). The Horseman makes a shushing sound to the two little blonds he runs into. One of them promptly snaps a branch to get his pursuers' attention. You have to see it to believe it. Another good one is when Nesmith asks Ichabod, ""Is he dead?"" Ichabod's logical but funny reply: ""That's the trouble. He was dead to begin with."" There are a lot of others but I won't reveal any more. Rest assured, though, they are there.Now as to the main cast, what can I say about Johnny Depp (positive or negative) that hasn't been said before? I will say that he is one of my favorite off-beat film actors (still love his stuff in ""Ed Wood) and his portrayal of Constable Ichabod Crane (no, you haven't wandered into the wrong movie; that's one of the changes that was added on early) is perhaps one of the most unlikely anti-heroes ever shot on film. A prim and proper shell of a man driven by reason and science, burnt by anguish over a very nasty childhood, Crane brings to mind Sherlock Holmes minus the nerves of steel (his teaming with young Nesmith would seem to verify this observation). This has to be the only movie that I've ever seen where the hero faints more often than the heroine. Speaking of said heroine, Christini Ricci admittedly does not have much to work with, but she infuses what she has with commendable skill. Perhaps one of the reasons for the minimalist screen time/performance was to increase the uncertainty about her true nature. As to what that might be...I'm not going to tell you. Though his name isn't mentioned often, I honestly feel that Casper Van Dien, considering what I have seen of his mediocre acting skills, was born to play the part of the brave but brainless Bram Bones. His best moment has to be his fight with the Horseman (a piece of macabre comedy that Buster Keaton could have admired).The only other thing I've left to add about the film is that it is best that you pay attention to every detail, major or minor, during the movie. The biggest suprise of the whole film for me was how all the little pieces scattered here and there fit together at the film's climax. It'll be most interesting to see what Burton will pull next from his magic bag of tricks.",Sleepy Hollow
270,flickjunkie-3,Magnificent.,10,22 November 2000,"I had heard Sleepy Hollow was very good, but I wasn't expecting it to be what it was. One of the most spellbounding and best films ever constructed. This film is totally flawless, everything about it I loved.Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a small-town constable, is sent by his superior (Christopher Lee) to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of brutal murders, Crane arrives, appropriately enough on Halloween, and quickly learns that all the victims were found beheaded and their bonces never found, Ensconed in the home of Sleepy Hollow's finest, Baltus Van Tassell (Michael Gambon), Constable Crane is told the story of the Hessian Horsemen (a pointy-toothed Christopher Walken) - a former German mercenary who specialised in decapitating the locals during the War of American Independence. It is his ghost - the Headless Horseman - whom the locals believe is responsible for the killings. Crane believes nothing of the sort until he comes neck to neck with demonic being. In between fainting with fear, leering with desire at the Van Tassell's daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) and several more attacks from the headless one, Crane begins to uncover the true story behind the towns killer...Tim Burton, as usual, delivers stunning direction, and his film is easily his best one yet. The actors are all amazing, Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci have amazing on-screen chemistry. Emmanuel Lubezki's camerawork is immaculate, he deserved an Oscar for his amazing cinematography. The music is another stand-out for Sleepy Hollow, Danny Elfman's score is engaging.If you miss Sleepy Hollow, you'll miss out on what is probably one of the best films of the 20th century.I rate Sleepy Hollow 10 out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow

The story is simply a bit dull, with some nice shots of Headless horseman riding through the forest and lot of decapitating and sympathetic 18th century geek Ichabod Crane courting prettily dressed pagan heroine Katrina. Nothing too impressive, really. There's also some on-target mockery of squalid Christian conservatism: unlike, let's say, pre-marital sex between lovers, the filth and sadism is OK - at least if it's in Bible and in the name of Bible because, ya know, it's Bible!...",Sleepy Hollow
272,bekayess,"Okay film, but why the ""R"" rating?",7,27 November 1999,"Waiting for the film to begin and suffering through the interminable previews of coming attractions, I was joined in my row my three young men easily in their early teens (one may have also been only 11 or 12).  I wondered why and how they got into this R-rated film since theaters are supposed to be checking IDs and keeping those under 17 out of R films. Based on what I had heard about the film, I made a judgement that these kids probably shouldn't see it--but I chose not to exercise my civic duty and report them to the management for their having sneaked in (as I heard them discussing a few minutes later).  During and after the film, though, I questioned the wisdom of the MPAA rating on this film.  I would have given it a PG-13 at most.  *SPOILERS AHEAD--BUT ONLY IF YOU'VE HEARD NOTHING ABOUT THE FILM*The beheadings were frequent, but not particularly gory, nor was the body that was cut in half (had I not known about this scene from reading ""Cinefantastique,"" I don't know it I would have picked up what was happening--the scene was so dark, and this was not as graphic as it could have been.)  Also, the spearing scene in the church has been done before in PG movies.  Maybe it's the over-sensitiveness of the times, but this is definitely a PG-13 film.  In fact, the historical references and use of language might interest our youth in history.  (By the way, there wasn't a profanity to be heard, that I recall, and no sexual situation beyond what is found on daytime soap operas.)  [For what it's worth, I'm not some kid complaining about the rating, but a 42-year-old man with a little more faith in the ability of our youth to distinguish between fantasy horror and violence and real world violence than the people who rated this film.]",Sleepy Hollow

274,SwingBatta,"Best movie of the 1990s. No ifs, ands or buts.",10,17 January 2000,"I saw the preview for `Sleepy Hollow,' where the main character is a forensics expert/detective, a week before its release when I went to see the tepid `Bone Collector,' which, ironically, also dealt with a forensics expert as the main character.  The preview was well done, but when I discovered who was starring and directing, it became an afterthought. Then, something inexplicable must've happened because I relented and decided to see SH after all when it was released.Well, what followed were 22 viewings in 39 days until it was pulled from my local theater.  Now, a film has to be pretty damn good to warrant such a hot streak. I simply haven't seen anything this awesome in years.  SH has everything: great plot (I'm sorry, but anyone who calls this a `Scooby Doo' mystery didn't pay much attention to the story), colorful characters, incredible visuals  was I the only one who liked Ichabod's dream sequences?  and phenomenal production design.  This is the first film that's commanded my attention through every frame; no scene ever lags or gets boring.  Heck, this movie has more Vans than U-Haul (as in 3 Tassels, 2 Garretts, a Brunt played by a Dien, and a Ripper), and more faints than a Backstreet Boys concert. What's not to like here?I won't delve into the plot since everybody knows it by now, but I will say that transforming Ichabod Crane from the lanky schoolteacher into a constable (a word I will always associate with `Mary Poppins') was a terrific idea, and since I am a huge fan of police/detective stories, this was right up my alley. The special effects fit like an old shoe; that's how natural they looked.  Granted, SH is hardly scary but it puts any modern bunk like the insipid `Scream' series, which go for blatant blood and guts rather than an actual plot to scare viewers, to shame.
Every performance in SH is beyond my reproach, especially Johnny Depp's, and I don't count myself among his fans. This blows away his previous top effort, `Donnie Brasco,' because it takes more talent to pull off an Ichabod Crane than a Joe Pistone.  His Crane, deeply committed to his occupation, is perhaps the most believable action hero, as opposed to the usual muscleheads usually seen in the action/detective genre (ahem, Arnie). He is a perfect combination of Sherlock Holmes and Inspector Clouseau as he has no problem performing autopsies yet freaks out at the sights of blood, spiders and horseback riders without heads, like any of us would.  He may also be the most nonviolent hero in recent memory: he never raised a hand to or threatened anyone, he played peacemaker (or tried to, anyway) on several occasions, didn't swear or spout any misogynistic lines, and for all the times he pulled his gun, he fired only once while trying to protect his two charges from the Horseman. His grand speech in the notary's office was simply amazing.Christina Ricci is equally impressive as Katrina Van Tassel, though I was disappointed at how she downplayed her character. `I play the stereotypical damsel in distress,' she says.  To me, she was the opposite.  Rather than a sexpot stagnating on the sidelines, she was part of the action: assisting Ichabod in his investigation (an early version of the script had her helping Ichabod dig out a grave), leaping onto a horse from a speeding carriage and jumping from a flaming windmill.  Some have complained about their `romance,' yet I instead considered it a very genuine friendship.  Her delivery was excellent as she goes to market with this role.  There is a particularly touching moment with her and Young Masbath (awesome Marc Pickering, who is everything Macaulay Culkin should have been) in the Western Woods. Her singing `Pickety Witch' made my blood run cold. Never mind Depp being nearly twice her age, it doesn't hinder their relationship. She just might be the first case of a miscast character that instead has a positive effect on a movie.The supporting cast stood out well with the lead players; they fit into the film nicely and no role was overshadowed.  All  the Van Tassels and the town elders (1799's version of Grumpy Old Men), among others (including much-maligned Casper Van Dien as Brom  give the guy a break already, folks), were fun to watch, particularly Michael Gough as the notary, but with his body language, notably his plodding like a rusty Tin Man from a funeral.Who better than Chris Walken to play the fanged, pre-headless Hessian? Let's face it, it would've killed the spooky, maniacal aura of his character if he had any spoken lines. Seeing Christopher Lee (who was an absolute steal for 1997's terrific `The Odyssey,' also produced by Francis Coppola) was a nice treat as well.Some of my favorite performances were also by the Killian family (Steven Waddington, Claire Skinner and Sean Stephens). The line `Don't pick your teeth, you teach Thomas bad habits!' always made me smile.However, I'd be lying if I said SH was a perfect movie. I thought the characters of Lady Van Tassel and Brom were somewhat underdeveloped. I was disappointed with the ending only that I had expected it to have the oomph `Seven' did (considering who wrote the screenplay), but this is merely small potatoes as the climax formidably holds its own anyway.  The runaway carriage scene left me slack-jawed; this is what today's lackluster car chases should take notes from.  The Headless Horseman leaves Darth Maul from last May's disappointing `Phantom Menace' and any other horror villains in the dust. Incredible swordplay, especially in the fight under the famous covered bridge.Go see this right away, you won't be disappointed.  This was the final film I saw for the millennium...perfect. If SH does not garner any Oscar nominations in the technical categories, then I'll make someone tie me up with telephone wire and watch `The Postman' for 24 hours straight. 10/10",Sleepy Hollow
275,audrablum,"Out of the box, interesting, and enjoyable",9,3 November 2018,"This week I watched Tim Burton's fantasy-horror-mystery Sleepy Hollow (1999). The logline reads ""Ichabod Crane is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate the decapitations of three people, with the culprit being the legendary apparition, The Headless Horseman."" I found the film when I googled ""not too scary movies to watch on Halloween."" I can safely say this fit the bill of being creepy enough to be a good Halloween flick, but not so creepy that I didn't enjoy it. I really enjoyed the way that the genres of fantasy, horror, and mystery. I felt that the film was engaging and interesting without being over the top gore or too scary. This combination also gave the film a uniqueness that isn't shared over other horror genre or mystery films and I feel that it worked well for the story. The script is based on the book ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" and it seemed like a good representation of the story and a natural choice for a Tim Burton film. The script could have endured a little further revision to kind of polish it and eliminate any unnecessary dialogue. Most of the actors were enchanting choices for their roles and pulled off wonderful performances, all except for Christina Ricci. Both her acting and her voice were extremely flat in this film and I was left feeling really put off by her as a casting choice in this film. The only sense I could make of her as the choice for this role is her slight visual resemblance to Helena Bonham Carter. Other than that the role felt wasted on her. Naturally, being a Tim Burton film all of the elements of production were there. The audio and dialogue was clear and professional grade. The color correction was beautiful and consistent. The look of the film was just hauntingly gorgeous. All in all, I was glad to have finally seen this film, even if I was a little late to the game.

276,H_Spengler,What more can you want?!,10,22 October 2008,"Warning: POSSIBLE spoilers.What more could you want out of a horror movie? This has it all, a dark and convincing storyline, interesting characters, appropriate settings and cinematography, well done graphics and stunts and a talented cast of veteran actors. I'm a fan of Tim Burton's movies in general (with exception of Planet of the Apes.) He's a dark and gifted director, and has a talent for turning almost everything he touches into dark gold.So what if Ichabod Crane (played perfectly by Depp) is a police investigator instead of a school teacher? It works doesn't it? I give props to Burton also for casting Christopher Lee, and Michael Gough in this movie, however small the role. The cast is perfect for their respective characters. The only one I wasn't COMPLETELY sold on was Christina Ricci. I like Ricci, but still question whether this was her role. But none the less, her performance was acceptable. The real scene stealer here is the Headless Horseman, played appropriately and surprisingly (didn't know he was in it prior to viewing) Christopher Walken, he steals every scene he's in. Ray Park did a fabulous job as the ""headless"" version of the Horseman. I won't get too much into the story, you probably know it, if not there's several hundred reviews regarding it. The cinematography is beautiful, dark, spooky and appropriate. (There is a real Sleepy Hollow, it's a few hours from where I live). Danny Elfman's score only adds an extra layer of darkness. One of the things I was impressed about the most was all the subtle background things incorporated into the scenes.

278,maitreg,marvelous costumes and scenery,9,10 July 2000,"This was the best 1800 scenery and costumes I've ever seen in a movie. Combined with the clever use/lack of color, they conjured up an image of precisely what we would think 1800 New England would look and feel like.The worst thing about the movie was the music.  It was quite dreadful and lacked any sort of synchronization with the ongoing plot.  Mystery music continued through the comical scenes so much that it confuses the watcher and almost hides the comedy itself.  It did very little to strengthen the plot and most of the scenes could have done without music entirely as the scenery, color, sound, plot, and acting were more than capable of sustaining the movie's quality.I really didn't know what to expect when going into this.  Some critics bashed it for not sticking to the book and others praised the costumes and scenery.  I don't see the veering from the book's plot a weakness at all. In fact, it was much more entertaining and satisfying than the original.I was a bit confused about Ichabod Crane's character and personality. Although Depp appeared to play what was directed, the character itself seemed to lack the intelligence, experience, and couth you'd expect from the character in the original story.  But alas, this is a rewrite, so I probably should not criticize for this.Christina Ricci (Katrina) definitely shows promise although she appeared to lack enthusiasm.  For that much money, you would expect her to be able to ""fake it"", but it was still a decent job.  Miranda Richardson (Lady Van Tassel) had some good moments, but she also lacked enthusiasm and seemed very distant at times.  She has proven worthy with perfect performances in ""Merlin"" and ""Alice in Wonderland"".Fabulous performances by all of the members on the town's council, but Jeffrey Jones is still stuck in my head as ""Charles Deitz"" in ""Beetlejuice"".Christopher Walken was absolutely incredible and easily stole the show!!

You can't miss it.Johnny Depp stars as a small-town counstable named Ichabod Crane, who gets sent to the small-town named Sleepy Hollow to investigate the seriously scary decapitating horseman.Co-starring Christina Ricci, Jeffrey Jones and Christopher Walken (who looks very scary in this flick!) - Sleepy Hollow is the must-see movie of 1999.

284,Doogie D,"has its problems, but pretty terrific",8,25 November 1999,"(This review includes spoilers.  Not MAJOR spoliers, but spoilers nevertheless.)SLEEPY HOLLOW may not be quite great, but it's pretty close.  Burton works with one if his better - if somewhat conventional - scripts, and that helps; if there is a dash of Simpson/Bruckheimer plot device, at least there's none of the muddiness of Tim's BATMAN films.  Johnny Depp is terrific as Ichabod Crane - seems this very versatile actor can do little wrong - and his humorous scenes somehow blend nicely with the very creepy Horseman moments. Usually, directors strain to achieve horror/comedy and it doesn't quite come off; SLEEPY HOLLOW manages this well.  The campy elements work fine.Some of the scenes - I'm thinking particularly of the flashbacks - aren't necessary and slow the pace slightly.  But other details are terrific: the Horseman has a terrific signature flip he performs with his sword just before he strikes; I imagine we can thank Ray Park for that. 
-- The Horseman.  Burton and his actors (more than one play the part) manage to make this villain a fully-formed character.  Indeed, I believed him more after his beheading than before.  The first time we see him leaping horseback from his lair is astonishing; the charging tilt of his sword is beautiful and frightening -- almost noble in determination.Much has been made of the cinematography, and rightly so.  The film is shot in dusty, washed out earth tones and purples, and I enjoyed seeing the occasional dashes of color - one book among a pile drawing the eye.  And the splashes of color: yes, the blood does stand out, and this one's not for the squeamish; I was cringing and curling away from the screen more than once.An interesting note: there's the fashionable Christian-bashing going on (why are ministers always adulterers, torturers, or child molesters?), yet a house of God is the one place the Horseman can't enter.  Doesn't stop him, though; this is a crafty Hessian from Hell.",Sleepy Hollow

That would be the computerized gore and ""horror"".  It drains the emotional interest from the thing.  It says ""Mummy Mummy Mummy"".  Rats!  I bought a full price ticket for this one.  Maybe seeing Christina Ricci as a  blonde in the impeccable taste of a Dutch master's painting was worth it.  The gray makeup smudges on Johnny Depp's face were very irritating, on the other hand, but i got over it.",Sleepy Hollow
286,Lamia7609,"This Movie is ""all together ooky""",7,16 November 2000,I loved this movie.  The fact that it bears no resemblance to the short story by Washington Irving really didn't affect my opinion of it.  I think if Burton had approached it as just another chapter of Sleepy Hollow people would have been more accepting of it.  The biggest complaint I hear about it is that it isn't like the story.  Aside from that it's a great story and has some incredible effects. DVD really affords the viewer the luxury of watching the heads get whacked off in slow motion. Let's face it Walken is the most frightening individual ever to grace the screen (with the exception of Batman 2).  I was very creeped out.,Sleepy Hollow

288,MissCzarChasm,A Stunning Visual Treat,9,12 August 2000,"Tim Burton has to be one of the best filmmakers in recent memory. He set the standard for the first 2 Batman films, he astounded us with his visual creativity with Edward Scissorhands, and he made everything that appeared in A nightmare before Christmas seem believable. Now he has brought us Sleepy Hollow which has to be one of the best films he has directed thus far. his vision for this film made it a truly great one.Here's the basic plots. In the small town of Sleepy Hollow murders are being committed where the killer is claiming the heads of it's victims. Constable Ichabod Crane is sent there to investigate and he believes the killer is of flesh and blood but the towns people know of the true horror in sleepy hollow and it's in the form of a headless horsemen. Soon crane discovers that all the victims are connected and that there is a conspiracy at hand.The acting in this film is great. Johnnt Depp is the most versatile actor of our generation. Crane is by far one of the best characters he has ever played. Chrstinna Ricci is good also but i do agree with the other comments that she needed just a bit more energy but she was good nonetheless.I truly recommend this film, but beware you might lose your head. j/k.",Sleepy Hollow

290,Niv-1,Should Have been a Best Picture Contender.,8,29 August 2001,"Why should have Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"" been a Best Picture contender? Simply because it is one of the best looking, beautiful pictures ever made. 
     It also had great performances and a clever, humorous, and twisty script written by Kevin Yagher and Andrew Walker based on the story by Washington Irving.       The costumes, cinematography and sets were among the best looking in history. The movie was nominated in all of those categories, but the people who put the film together should have been nominated too (those being the producers)as well as director Tim Burton who put his unmistakable stamp on the movie and put everything to good use.       Emmanuel Lubezki shot some of the best looking scenes in history. The scenes with Lisa Marie as Lady Crane are magnificent, they are literally breathtaking. Other scenes include the flashbacks with Christopher Walken as the Hessian, the scene in the church, the last scene in New York City, and many others. 
     The costumes by Colleen Atwood were the best in her long career. She has been nominated for Oscars for the films ""Beloved"" and ""Little Women"" but her costumes in ""Sleepy Hollow"" were her best ever. Especially good were her costumes for Miranda Richardson. There is one scene near the end of the movie (in a flashback)where she wears possibly the best looking costume ever designed. 
     The Art Direction and set decoration did win an Oscar for Rick Heinrichs and Peter Young. The entire movie was shot indoors but their sets are so realistic and great looking that you would think the movie was shot outside. Especially good is the twisted tree. 
     The actors are also very good. Johnny Depp gives a very funny, convincing performance that ranks among his best. Christina Ricci also gives a very good performance as does Miranda Richardson. Also good in supporting roles are Michael Gambon, Jeffrey Jones, Richard Griffiths, and Christopher Walken. Walken creates a truly horrifying character and is excellent in the small role as the horseman. 
     Overall ""Sleepy Hollow, is one of the best looking films ever shot, and is funny and well acted, hugely underrated.",Sleepy Hollow
291,spj-4,"lingering for more from ""Sleepy Hollow""",8,1 August 2007,"I think this is a strong dramatic movie that is worthy of much thought, that the collective efforts of actors & contributors behind the scene, have combined to produce into a quality movie.It is suspenseful, & in that regard, it reminded me of a masterpiece over a decade before, that I chanced upon & that seemed to be unheralded by movie critics. ""Jamaica Inn"" was a quality production of British suspense & drama & with substance & thoughtful plot, resulted in a complete product that lingered! Till this one several years later! This too, is much admired. I thought enough of it to want it in my collection! The same eerie lingering possibilities. Much more popularist in style but very similar if not original, in substance.The cast of the likes of Johnny Depp & Michael Gambon, are impressive in their roles, & appropriate to the evolving drama. But there are unanswered questions ... like why does the 'headless horseman' fail to claim the hero when he might have claimed him without mercy, while similarly claiming another victim? If not earlier, when hooves thunder in from a distance! This is still early on! But maybe it is the intention of the production team here, to present that good & evil are so delicately poised, in ongoing battle. Only the scales are shifted in favour of the good & the fair & the just, layered by circumstance & individual contribution.But despite such flaws or perceived deficiencies, real or imagined, it is presented to the viewer as a quality piece that I felt intrigued enough to watch a second time, & enjoyed this experience much more so than the first.So give way to your intrigue & let its suspense overtake you with each approaching hoof beat & shadow that may be threatening in the darkness from a distance. But maybe it a positive. Let its simplicity & investigation engulf you with drama & curiosity, that reveals much, with its child-like trance of delight, slowly unraveling.It may not leave you fully satisfied, but you will be left lingering for more from ""Sleepy Hollow"".",Sleepy Hollow
292,Dkish,"""Sleepy Hollow"" is by far one of Tim Burton's greatest films.",10,21 November 1999,"""Heads Will Roll!!"" was the tagline for the Tim Burton take on the ""Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" which tells the tale of a lowly school teacher who must face his greatest fear and become a man. The Washington Irving classic will always be remembered as the ""headless horseman"" tale with flaming pumpkins and an idiot hero. In the 1999 adaptation the hero, Icabod Crane is now a bumbling New York Detective who seems to know more about forensics then his fellow man of that time. As a joke the New York police department sends him to ""Sleepy Hollow"" to uncover the ""decapitating murderer"". What Crane finds shocks and changes our hero slowly into a man. ""Sleepy Hollow"" is by far one of Tim Burton's greatest films. Ever since he captivated the world by bringing the ""real"" Batman to the big screen, ten years ago, he has always been flirting with making a great gothic horror film. Every film he has touched has been enchanted with gothic charisma. From ""Edward Scissorhands"" to ""Mars Attacks"" they have all been laced in his immersion of horror and fairytale. In ""Sleepy Hollow"" he finds his true calling as he delivers us into his gothic mystique. As he did in the first two Batman films, the camera stands back and then swoops into the great city of New York. Showing the dark and moody world he is trying to capture. As this panoramic tour continues the audience is pulled harder and harder in. This is Tim Burton at his best.The film then drops into Icabod's world where he seems to be the outsider who doesn't quite fit in. The film focuses upon the face of Johnny Depp who is quite pale and wide eyed. In two other Tim Burton films Johnny Depp has opened us to the world of Burton much like Richard Dreyfuss did in early Steven Spielberg films. Depp's portrayal of bumbling Icabod is remnant of ""Edward Scissorhands"" but even more human. An outsider trying to see past the town's folktale and uncover a real murder. I imagined Icabod to be sort of what happened if Sherlock Holmes stumbled in on Dracula himself. I think even a great detective like Holmes would be bumbling on a case like that.As Icabod explores the town to Sleepy Hollow we are treasured by the presence of other Tim Burton vets like Michael Gough, Jeffery Jones, Christopher Walken and Martin Landau. Icabod upon his arrival falls in love with the damsel Katrina Van Tassel played by Christina Ricci who seems to have something in common with Icabod's past. As we uncover the mysterious damsel Burton seems to let his film talk about what exactly is witchcraft and why skeptics don't understand it. This tugs at Icabod's dreams and his heart strings. Ricci's Katrina is not exactly a damsel in distress but a delightful addition to her growing repertoire of strong women roles. She has come along way from being Wednesday Addams. When the film finally hits it stride with the first encounter with the horseman we are already engulfed in the dark magic of Sleepy Hollow and the bewilderment of Icabod. Sleepy Hollow will be remembered as one of Tim Burton's masterpieces. (5 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer.",Sleepy Hollow
293,bhicks56,Decapitation has never been more fun,7,30 November 1999,"One thing I liked about Tim Burton's update of the classic Legend of Sleepy Hollow, is that it's not stingy with the blood. Blood is poured all over the place, but not in a revolting sort of way, but in a way that you expect. The town is so dark and spooky, you welcome to grisly beheadings of the headless horseman.Johnny Depp, in his third Burton film, is a nice Ichabod Crane. He's such a wuss, yet he walks away with his skull intact. There's alot of Burton regulars like Jeffrey Jones and Christopher Walken. His girlfriend, Lisa Marie, plays a very bewitching spirit in the movie. But this is Christina Ricci's first outing in a Burton film, which is surprising since their personas are at the same dark level (she is like the new Winona Ryder in the new Tim Burton movies). Equally surprising is that she plays a sweet, innocent Katrina Van Tassel.But enough with the actors. The only time actors really mattered in a Burton film was ED WOOD.The headless horseman looks great in this movie, with or without his head. He goes right in with Burton's usual gorgeously dark background. But, also, he adds a little fairy tale flavor, which you get really into. Almost entrancing.The ending is the weak point of the film. Everything comes together too quickly, yet there's a chase scene climax that involves the horseman, and that's about when you look at your watch and realize you have to go to the bathroom.This is not Tim Burton's best movie, though the setting is marvelous, there's too many characters to keep up with and his usual cartoonish scares (like the one involving the witch) doesn't make you feel anything anymore.Maybe it's Andrew Kevin Walker's script, or at least the several revisions of it, which left the story muddled and uneven. It doesn't work for this movie, yet the decapitation scenes are loads of fun (who knew there were so many ways you could chop off a head!)",Sleepy Hollow
294,william_blake,a word from a guy who doesn't enjoy horror movies,9,8 July 2002,"once again, i have travelled to the mystic world of tim burton. his creations are unique works of art, that deserve their attention, and more.sleepy hollow was in many ways the best horror film i've seen, and i was quite surprised the rating wasn't higher. note, i do not enjoy horror movies in general, because they are always about senseless violence.in 'sleepy hollow', the evil IS really evil and scary as hell, but it's more. it's a great detective murder mystery, a love story and most of all great art.the costuming, effects and cinematography are breathtaking, and burtion keeps it all together quite enjoyably indeed. oh, and not to forget the great, haunting musical score danny elfman created for the occasion.johnny depp (my favorite actor) is splended as the scary little man ichabod crane who finds surprising courage to face evil but he is nr. 2 in this movie since another great actor christopher walken is just AMAZING as the headless horseman, hats off gentlemen. walken's best performance ever. maybe because he isn't talking in this one. ;)the thing in burton's movies is, always has been and hopefully always will be, is the magic that as ichabod crane said in the movie 'has bewitched me'. the fascinating, gothic worlds burton creates are something unique, where light and dark always has tremendous difference, but they can still be upside down, not always as the viewer would expect.if you want to look for something negative about 'sleepy hollow', it's miranda richardson's not so good performance and, if there is one, i would be most interested to see the director's cut. i was left with a feeling that the movie fast forwarded to the end, which might please some of the viewers, but i wouldn't have minded a little more character developement and detective work of crane.in conclusion, a very very good magical atmospheric old school horror story. me likes!!!",Sleepy Hollow

297,mbworm,"Funny, Thrilling and Visually Stunning",8,14 January 2008,"This DVD is worth the purchase just for the striking cinematography and visual imagery of this macabre film. Tim Burton uses all of his best elements in this supernatural thriller, the result being a slightly over the top but exceptional comedy horror fest.Johnny Depp is Ichabod Crane, a young, fidgety and eccentric forensics expert who is sent to the small secluded village of Sleepy Hollow to uncover its nasty secrets. At night, a cloaked figure on a massive black horse is stalking and murdering a seemingly random string of the town's residents, and clearly has no intention of stopping unless Crane can solve the mystery.The town is a series of stunning old fashioned architectures and is shot in a gloomy, dense fog. All in supreme Tim Burton fashion, the visuals and special effects especially stand out in ""Hollow"". Another intriguing aspect is Christina Ricci as the pale, beautiful girl Katrina Von Tassel, who aids Ichabod in his quest for the truth- and survival.Although it all sounds dark and it is, with loads of blood splattered over it (tastefully), the whole film has a heavy undertone of black humor and it never takes itself too seriously. When the horseman cuts off heads, they spin around before hitting the ground. How seriously can you take it?

And did they need to blow up a windmill to keep my attention?  I was fascinated by Depp's performance, but this sudden need to throw in pointless pyrotechnics lost me.  The carriage chase scene seemed better suited to an ""Indiana Jones"" ripoff, and what the hell was Lady Van Tassel doing showing up again at the end to gloat over her victory????  which only put her in the position to be defeated.....the plotting during the last 20 minutes of this movie went right into the toilet!

It's a good old ghost story with ample doses of comedy and thrills -- and a wonderful performance by Johnny Depp as Ichabod Crane who comes to Sleepy Hollow to prove that the supernatural goings on have a basis in scientific fact.  Depp is marvelous, as he is in all of the films he's done with Burton.  The two of them bring out the best in each other and create cinema magic.  The sets are eerie and atmospheric, filled with fog and mists that build tension and a feel for the late 18th century countryside.  I really can't say enough about the set direction.  I tip my hat to whoever did it. Christina Ricci provides more than adequate love interest and she looks lovely in her costumes.  Christopher Walken looks like he had a marvelous time with his fake teeth, snarling at everyone like a maniac.  All in all, the move is deliciously over-the-top, straight from the Puritanical rants of hellfire and brimstone, witchcraft and boogeymen that would drag good Christians down to their doom.

301,Pythe,A love letter to the horror genre,9,12 April 2009,"Sleepy Hollow runs a close second to Ed Wood as my favorite Tim Burton film so far, and represents perhaps the quintessential ""Tim Burton-as-brand-name"" experience. To date it is his only genuine horror film, though it tends to run much closer to tongue-in-cheek black comedy, and as such serves as something of a coat rack onto which Burton hangs the dark fabrics of horror films stretching back a full century. The (rather obvious) use of sound stages and the economy of imagery reminds one of silent films such as Nosferatu or the John Barrymore version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, along with a visual scheme that is often almost monochromatic in its use of sepia tones, dark blues, and blacks and whites. The copious, and sometimes ludicrous, splattering of blood against pretty much every clean surface brings to mind the orgiastic excess of grue that characterized slasher films of the eighties. The lavish set design and the abundance of fog and mist, along with the ""inspector"" element of the story (and the casting of Christopher Lee in a minor role), pay tribute to the Hammer films of the fifties and sixties, particularly those helmed by stylish Technicolor maven Terence Fisher.Probably the biggest influence on Burton's style, however, is the late Mario Bava, a cult figure whose visually sumptuous low-budget films of the sixties and seventies have been worshiped by filmmakers as diverse as John Landis, Dario Argento, Edgar Wright, Joe Dante, and Quentin Tarantino (but is otherwise relatively, and regrettably, unknown, even in his native Italy). Most apparently reflected in Sleepy Hollow are Bava's Gothic chillers, Black Sunday and Kill, Baby...Kill! Bava, often criticized as a ""style over substance"" director who cared more about the way his films looked than about story or characterization (a charge often, and probably not coincidentally, leveled at Burton), was a master of mood, with the ability to charge even the most heinous act of murder with a psychosexual beauty, and the knack for soaking even the thinnest plot in an atmosphere that is erotic, gorgeous, and unnerving.Bava's sensibilities are also reflected in the film's quirky sense of humor as well, which makes use of a fantastic cast. Michael Gambon, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gough, Jeffrey Jones, and Richard Griffiths, as key members of the community who have a connection with the mystery at the heart of the Headless Horseman murders, all turn up the eccentricity level to 11, with Johnny Depp fearlessly leading the way as the strangely effeminate inspector, Ichabod Crane, sent to investigate the rash of recent murders in a superstitious New England town. Crane is certainly an unconventional action hero--he faints no less than four times throughout the film--and yet his squeamish prissiness works superbly within the off-kilter execution of this dark fairy tale. Who else but Johnny Depp could have played this role? Katrina Van Tassel, as portrayed by Christina Ricci, is a somewhat underdeveloped love interest, but she's got enough courage and heart to keep from fading into the background, and her purity and virtue actually keep her sympathetic as opposed to boring or self-righteous. Another stand-out is Marc Pickering as Young Masbath, sort of the Robin to Ichabod's Batman. A preteen sidekick could have potentially become a desperate and annoying bid for the attention of the high school demographic, but the character both as written and as played by Pickering steers clear of the usual clichés to become just as interesting, funny, and worthwhile as everyone else. And, needless to say, Miranda Richardson and Christopher Walken are equally fascinating and fun to watch in their respective roles, and former Burton fiancée Lisa Marie has just the right ""Women of '60s Horror"" look to her in a small but pivotal role as Ichabod's mother.Odds and ends: Kevin Yagher's special effects work here is astonishing. The decapitated heads, even when seen in close up, are phenomenally realistic, more so even than in many films that have come out in the decade since. (Yagher, incidentally, was on board to direct the project in its early stages.) Danny Elfman's score, as usual, is fantastic, hitting all the right notes of portent, eerie grandiosity, and excitement. The cinematography, by frequent Alfonso Cuaron collaborator Emmanuel Lubezki, is gorgeous, and Colleen Atwood does her usual stellar work as Costume Designer. Stunt coordinator Nick Gillard, most famous at the time for his choreography on The Phantom Menace, helps bring to life some fantastic action set pieces that somehow manage to stay within the boundaries of a Gothic horror piece. And of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the script by Seven scribe Andrew Kevin Walker. Of course, fans of Washington Irving's original short story may not share my enthusiasm, since Walker discards Irving's themes and decides that the Headless Horseman really is supernatural (and who can blame him, since most of us forget the bones of Irving's story anyway and only remember the ghostly apparition that didn't actually exist).All in all, Sleepy Hollow is a supreme fright flick, entirely appropriate for any rainy day or spooky night.",Sleepy Hollow

I have not read Washington Irving's story, but I can't imagine that it was meant to be just a brainless gore fest with one head after another gruesomely chopped off. I thought the acting was mediocre and Depp's performance was quite odd. Yes, the visual style was appealing, which is why I gave this movie a 3 instead of a 1.

303,Chris-332,Marvelously Entertaining and Visually Stunning!,5,20 November 1999,"Sleepy Hollow is by far a visual masterpiece. Tim Burton surpasses absolutely anyone with his dark and quirky visions. Just looking at the town of Sleepy Hollow in the previews, I knew this movie would be a great treat. Johnny Depp's performance in the movie was exceptional! Ichabod Crane's character in the new version of the classic story is by far the greatest character I've seen on a movie screen in a long time. The Headless Horseman is awesome in the movie. Ray Park was amazing with the incredible stunts he did. The fight scene on the bridge, Brom Bones and Ichabod vs. The Horseman, reminded me of the fabulous fight scene at the end of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace. Christopher Walken was creepy as the Horseman with his head on. But most of all, the movie was outrageously exciting. The movie kept my adrenaline going the whole time. And one thing I haven't heard anyone say before, was that the story was great. I loved all the twists in the movie. Sure, it was confusing in some parts, but it all got solved at the end.Well, now I need to come to the flaws in the movie. The music by Danny Elfman, although fit for the movie, was not as memorable as all the other scores he did with Tim Burton, like Batman, Edward Scissorhands, or Beetlejuice. And the end was a little silly, when you found out who the (unfortunately) real villain of the movie was. The romance between Ichabod and Katrina was pointless, even though I wasn't as annoyed about it as some other reviewers. Some of the acting in the movie was stiff, like in The Phantom Menace.But even though it had its flaws, it still was an awesome movie. It was visually beautiful, it had a great script, it was extremely exciting and gory, and Johnny Depp was so great to watch in the movie because of his amazing acting ability. Yeah, I was a little overhyped about the movie, but no movie could get up to the quality I thought Sleepy Hollow would have.

304,nehpetstephen,Visually Stunning,6,18 August 2000,"I wasn't too thrilled about the acting in this new take on the classic Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Most of the other reviewers here have stated that Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci were both spectacular, but in my opinion, almost any actor could have delivered a similar, if not better, performance. The plot, which is very different from the original story, was innovative, but the screenplay nearly ruins it by explaining the whole background in one speech towards the end instead of showing it to us.However, this movie is not a complete loss. It is almost fully redeemed by stunning cinematography and set design, as well as top-of-the-line special effects. The whole movie, from its opening scene to its ending, carries an appropriate, gloomy atmosphere. Director Burton perfectly captures the essence of 1799, better than other historical movies have been able to do.

But the other actors are also great - Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christopher Lee and the rest of the cast play very well, and Christopher Walken is the ideal choice for the murderous Headless Horseman. The story is action-packed, fast paced and will entertains fans of horror-movies, even if the film itself is not scary at all.

To begin with, what hasn't been said about this complete ""auteur"" that I could probably say now, almost nothing. Since the beginning we can see that the places portrayed by Burton are not the real cities, but how he sees these places. New York is colorless and boring, and yet crude. But the town of Sleepy Hollow is something else, is mysterious, is dark, mistyful, and yet with certain cosyness; Sleepy Hollow is a place far different from the rest of the world that makes us feel like we are in another very weird dimension that reminds us his previous films.Again Burton uses the elements that have made his previous work famous, such as horror, the fight of one man against the whole world just because he is different, the animated cartoon-like effects, the wind mill that in a way represents his mind put on screen as a physical part of the environment through which the characters confront the nemesis, and a certain touch of elegant humour that could be even cataloged as dark. It is just impossible to see this films without thinking ""this is totally a Tim Burton film"", and again he wouldn't be complete without a score by Danny Elfman whose best scores have been the ones he's made for Burton's films. All in all, I don't see a reason not to like this one, and as for me, it has already become one of those films I will never get tired of watching it.",Sleepy Hollow
307,nvillesanti,Burton's Instant Classic of Horror,10,10 June 2009,"Without a doubt, Tim Burton is an artist. He has proved that when he brought us Batman (1989) and Edward Scissorhands. This time he outdoes himself with Sleepy Hollow. He brings back that Gothic horror from the Hammer Films, but with a fairy tale fell to it. Sleepy Hollow is set in the 1800 and tells the story of Ichabod Crane (played by Jonny Depp), an odd, open minded New York constable who is sent to investigate mysterious murders in a small village known as Sleepy Hollow. Crane relies on weird gadgets and sometimes odd theories to solve crimes, but this time he will face a supernatural force he had never come across, The Dreaded Headless Horseman. This movie is a master piece and has one of the most beautiful set designs I have ever seen. Christopher Walken and Ray Park (Darth Maul) give life to the Headless Horseman. Also, Christopher Lee makes a guest appearance at the beginning of the movie. The plot is great, the cast is phenomenal, and the photography is gorgeous. This movie is among one of my favorite smart and entertaining horror films. If you haven't seen it and you like classic horror film like the Hammer Films productions from the 50s and 60s you will love this one.",Sleepy Hollow

And, as is Burton's style, you see pieces of his other films in this one as well. There is a scarecrow that looks an awful lot like Jack Skellington, and bats appear throughout the film.This is the second movie that I have thought Depp cute in (the other being 'Edward Scissorhands'). And although I am NOT a Depp fan in ANY way, he gives a wonderful performance as Ichabod Crane. And unlike the reviewers, I thought Christina Ricci did a fine job as Katrina Van Tassel. From the moment this movie began I was swept away to Sleepy Hollow. I did not want it to end. This is the perfect film for Halloween. Make sure you see 'Sleepy Hollow.'

309,rtrnt,Tim Burton's spin on the Washington Irving horror classic,7,13 September 2020,"This iconic story is given a new take courtesy of Tim Burton's brutal, bloody and depraved style of filmmaking. In this version, Ichabod Crane is actually a New York law enforcement official who comes to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of murders by decapitation. What follows is a dark journey into the underbelly of this quiet but ominous town where many a dark secret resides.Johnny Depp is exceptional as Crane, but his screen presence is complimented nicely by Christina Ricci as the young woman who seems to know more than he realizes. Miranda Richardson is devilish in a seemingly nominal supporting role that becomes more fleshed out. The whole film is covered in Burton's tawdry darkness and brooding aura.My only gripe would be an ending that begs more questions than it answers. Recommended to diehard Burton fans and everyone who wants to have a genuine Halloween experience.",Sleepy Hollow

It was like a dark fairytale!Johnny Depp's performance was great, since I love the way he portrays eccentric roles along with humour.I like topics about dark magic, urban legends and other occultist things. This film contains all the aforementioned.The only thing I want to mention, is that I don't consider this film as a horror. It's not scary at all. Sure, it does contain gore, but it doesn't really look that realistic (I personally don't mind), the presentation of horseman, again, wasn't scary, but creepy I would say. In general, I wouldn't say that this film could scare someone. The best phrase to describe this, is ""spooky with dark humour elements"". Also it's absolutely gothic, which I love it!

But . . . for some reason it all left me unaffected.  I would give the film a ""thumbs up"" and recommend it, but maybe I've come to expect more from the man who created Edward Scissorhands and Nightmare Before Christmas. Maybe the plot was a little TOO clever, too convoluted to quite buy into. Maybe the scenes of the Horseman doing his thing were a little too realistic and unimaginative.

313,JoshSharpe,Skip it.,4,18 November 2012,"Tim Burton has made two horror movies: first this and then in 2007, he made Sweeney Todd. Sweeney Todd was unbelievably great. This however, was not. The film opens with the first of three murders that occur in the small community of Sleepy Hollow. The victims are found decapitated, their heads missing. These strange happenings attract scientific detective Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, to solve the mystery. The townspeople are certain that the murderer is the ghost of the Headless Horseman, who lived in Sleepy Hollow years ago. Ichabod Crane is insistent on proving that this is not a supernatural figure, but after a few more murders, even he begins to believe it as well. First of all, this movie is in no way scary. I enjoy being scared and if I intend to see a horror movie, then I would hope and expect to be scared. This did not do it for me. After the first few murders, I lost interest. The movie mainly consisted of the Headless Horseman running around, and chopping people heads off. Oh, and don't forget, yelling ""Aah!"" It was a bit hard to take seriously. Also, Johnny Depp was quite mild and disappointing in the lead. He has had far better roles in other films. Despite the talented people involved, this movie was a major disappointment and a dud.",Sleepy Hollow
314,brainofj72,A Darker Hollow,8,28 October 2005,"Washington Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow is a story that has incessantly intrigued throughout its many years of existence. How could it not? The idea of a ghostly headless horseman out to decapitate others in order to restore his own, um, shortcoming is undeniably interesting. However, many feel that Irving did not explore the dark side of this subject matter nearly enough, as he primarily focused on romance. Those who think that should not be disappointed by Tim Burton's adaptation, Sleepy Hollow.The story has been altered a little. Ichabod Crane (Depp), a young big city detective (instead of a school teacher) interested in unconventional methods, is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow in order to solve a series of beheadings that the townspeople insist were committed by a mythical murderer named the Headless Horseman.Burton, a director famous for his dark Gothic films, certainly does not stray from his signature visual formula here. Sleepy Hollow is bathed in perfectly recreated Gothic sets accented by undeniably effective bleached cinematography. This film is really quite beautiful to look at, in the manner that an ominous storm on the horizon is. Burton also injects a dark, violent edge into the story that Irving did not, and this will either please or repulse. I must admit that I was delighted to see the Headless Horseman receive the gritty treatment he deserves. He is actually portrayed by two actors in the film: Ray Park for the headless sequences and the always wonderful Christopher Walken for the scenes requiring a face. While Walken's performance is competent, I was surprised to find myself more impressed with Park. He provides the Horseman with impeccable intimidating body language and somehow manages to develop the character much more effectively than Walken, even though he never shows his face. Park has also delivered impressive performances as Darth Maul in Star Wars: Episode I: The Phantom Menace and as Toad in X-Men. I'd love to see him tackle some bigger roles.But I digress.Though the film takes a considerably darker angle than Irving's book, there is still a romantic subplot between Crane and Katrina (Ricci), a comely young woman, that is, for the most part, enjoyable, though it does provide one of the corniest exchanges ever put on celluloid: -Katrina: Do you think me wicked? -Crane: No... but perhaps there is a little bit of witch in you, Katrina. -Katrina: Why do you say that? -Crane: Because you have bewitched me.Yeah. Ugh.Another element that tones down the dark feeling a bit is that Sleepy Hollow is a horror comedy. There are some insidiously funny moments, such as Crane's frank explanation as to why a dead body should not be repositioned at a crime scene. The film occasionally ignores basic physical laws in order to deliver a gag (for instance, Crane is sprayed in the face with blood while performing an autopsy - the body's blood would obviously not be flowing), but it's all in good fun - just don't over-think it.Johnny Depp portrays Ichabod Crane with a giddy, eccentric, nuanced, and utterly delightful glee - just further proof that he is one of the finest actors alive. Another performance that warrants mention is that of Ian McDiarmid (known to most as Senator/Supreme Chancellor/Emperor Palpatine from Star Wars).When I first saw the film, I gave it an A-, most likely because I was overwhelmed by how fantastic the film was visually, but upon rewatching it, I really had to demote it to a B+. Why? Well, to put it bluntly, the writing is just bad. The dialogue is really quite dreadful at times and, toward the end, the story becomes ridiculously convoluted. If a film has a basic plot as fascinating as Sleepy Hollow does, it's really not necessary to throw in a supremely confusing subplot about how the Van Whos double-crossed the Van Whats in order to exact revenge upon the Van Wheres. It just causes headaches. The film also has a pretty standard, formulaic action movie climax.But flaws aside, Sleepy Hollow is a fun, entertaining Gothic horror comedy, and fans of Burton or Depp should not be disappointed.8/10",Sleepy Hollow
315,piksplanet,probably burton's best work till date..,9,10 September 2008,"Sleepy Hollow is a period horror film released in 1999 and marks the third collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. After making Edward Scissorhands and Ed Wood, the teaming of Burton and Depp has become one that works wonders. Loosely based on Washington Irwing's story The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, the film takes the story of Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman one step further.The first thing about Sleepy Hollow is it's elaborate, haunting and eerie set design. Tim Burton is best known for giving an eerie turn on everything he makes (Recall : Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Yet another Depp/Burton film). Sleepy Hollow already had elements of horror in it, Burton's task was to make it worth remembering. The use of fairytale music is prevalent in this film. Indeed a lot of its background score comprises the music from a music box or a doll house. The setting is silent, yet it screams. The town of Sleepy Hollow is always covered in fog. The woods are silent apart from the occasional brush of leaves underfoot. However, the excessive use of blood, like in his later Sweeney Todd is required to make the film what it is for the crisis comes from someone who does not have a head and who excels in chopping off others'. The horrific image of the witch, the sight of dead eyes through the floorboard, a sarcophagus spilling out its contents; these are what make Sleepy Hollow a work of art. The tree of the dead, with blood dripping from its roots uncovering what is hidden within its trunk will make one squirm in the seat. The cinematography is worthy of praise.Acting in the film is top notch. Everyone convincingly plays scared, and even tries to be a hero. None more so than Johnny Depp. One can understand his situation when he hides behind his blanket in bed and says,'It was a horseman, a dead one. Headless!' The flashbacks of Ichabod Crane are done marvelously. The echoes and imagery in those particular sequences are outstanding. Sleepy Hollow is probably the finest piece of cinema Tim Burton has made to date.9/10. Watch it alone, at night. The Horseman cometh.",Sleepy Hollow
316,Alex_Kladis,Quick Review,7,28 September 2018,"Oh! Look there... its' a Tim Burton and Johnny Depp collaboration!Sleepy Hollow was a great film, but has lost much of its magic with the passing of the time. It's still pretty good though.The number of Hollywood's legends working on this Pictures is just mesmerizing and one of the main reasons that it works. The make-up its also exceptional and (a long with the rest of the Picture) pretty much underrated.I cannot recommend it enough, if you are seeking for a movie to pass your time. It has its horror and thriller elements, its romance and the ""Family - Non-family"" tone that Burton's is amazing at!",Sleepy Hollow
317,sharkey197,Not a purist,8,9 August 2005,"Even though I am an English teacher, I did not find myself at all bothered by the fact that Burton took enormous liberties with Irving's short story. The atmosphere of Gothic mystery that he created was astounding and he familiarized a new generations with a classic American writer. But what I loved about this film was the production values; I saw it on the big screen and thought that every single frame could have been made into a wonderful, individual picture. Now with the pause on DVD my theory has been proved correct. This is one of the most beautifully photographed, almost heart-breakingly gorgeous productions I've ever seen. Did anyone noticed the paint peeling on the window sashes when Icabod first arrives? Such attention to detail! I just wish the film wasn't rated R. This would be so perfect to show to my critical viewing class as an example of first rate production design, but we are not allowed to show any R's. I really don't think it should be rated R; it's not really that gory and the one sex scene is tame indeed.",Sleepy Hollow

This is an excellent and absorbing story.As I have not read Washington Irvings story I did not really know what to expect. It became clear very early in the movie that there was indeed a supernatural cause behind the series of deaths (i.e. there was no faking the phenomenon by an errant villager for instance). The film does not however then plunge into a mass of pointless special effects and gore (although these were present in a significant way). It does in fact manage to blend a whodunit into the supernatural stew and a very tasty stew it is too. Despite the early knowledge that the immediate cause was supernatural there remained the mystery about who raised the horseman and who pulled his strings.The film is not for the squeamish but is highly recommended to fans of supernatural suspense.",Sleepy Hollow
319,Global_Marketing_Pros,"Optical significance of science, witch craft, sound, and color.",10,6 July 2006,"This film is an analytical version of an old wives tale. Generally what you can not see hence understand quickly brings fear or hesitation of the unknown. Where even a story of a witch, or a headless horseman can make even the most logical person cringe in the middle of the night in a dark forest.This story appeals to me because there is a princess of Sleepy Hollow. This princess is interested in charms and spells to help people while she is signified as a natural witch with the use of visual drawings with pink chalk, which is the most basic form of witchcraft. The story uses scientific theory to help explain phenomena that is either rare or very odd within society. Thus the villain of the film upon the climax makes for an interesting subject.Movie props in the film which emphasize optics include the over-sized magnifying glasses, contrasting colors of white and red during suspense (suspense bringing senses to a more heightened awareness through the perceptual vision), the two sided cardinal and cage,the use of the pentagram and other witch craft items. These use of cinema is in contrast to the real less defined phenomena of phantom senses when shared by twins as the villain of the film admits her guilt. I am also interested in how the Doppler effect and experimentation at the site the confession within the windmill plays its role with crude static electric generators.Frankly, I am suspicious of Christopher Walken in this film and how the casting was selected and his friendship with Robert Deniro because he stared in Johnny Angelheart as Satan. These guys are probably casted and picked on purpose because like in Americas Most Wanted they need to be watched. How they got involved in the film industry like Sinatra in the music industry. That's scary stuff. Home grown character.",Sleepy Hollow
320,Rovin,It was rather hollow,5,26 November 1999,"I generally view Tim Burton movies as getting high marks on art direction and visuals--but low marks on story, character and theme. That is my view of Sleepy Hollow.It doesnt retain much from Washington Irving's story. In fact the treatment of the Headless Horseman at times borders on the ludicrous(even for such material as this). At one point Brom Bones duels rather competantly with the Horseman--and at another time Crane winds up on the back of the demon horse--and is able to get it to gallop on command. Hey--this is supposed to be a ghost not a reanimated corpse! I give Disney credit for instilling their 1949 cartoon horseman with a supernatural grace. (one nice touch though--seeing Crane atop his plough horse Gunpowder--and passing through the covered bridge--there is a very clear homage to the Disney cartoon if you pay attention).It was also nice to see Christopher Lee again--although i wouldnt consider this film to be in the same league with Hammer films--those flicks had characters and stories!Oh yeah--and one really pathetic mistake early on. Crane says something like: ""The millenium is only a few months away..."" and the story is set in 1799.I think this movie might have been ""ghost""-written--certainly someone involved didnt have their head on straight--or maybe not at all.",Sleepy Hollow
321,sutcal,Not a bad period horror flick,7,30 July 2001,"The problem with horror movies with blood and gore involved is that the audience is so used to the special effects these days that the shock value is no longer there.  Therefore the strength of the plot becomes more important to retain the audiences attention for the duration of the movie.To this end Sleepy Hollow is a novel way of turning a ""slasher"" movie into a period slasher movie.  The problem with this is that the villain ""or the suspense"" associated with the Headless horsemen loses its scare factor after about 20 mins into the film.  After than it is the inevitable ending that you come to expect with the hero saving the day.Thats the problem I have with this movie, it promises so much yet you feel a little disappointed in the end that it never quite achieved what it set out to do.Johnny Depp is a little annoying as the bumbmling constable whislt Chrisina Ricci's characted is not developed enough.  She seems to fit the bill perfectly for her character, but we never get to see that enough in the movie.As far as horror flicks go its not too bad.

It is perfect with a great Johnny Depp and an evil(fantastic her final monologue)Miranda Richardson (she deserved and Oscar nomination). Great cameo by Martin Landau.

324,Kabumpo,Beautiful disappointment,5,20 January 2000,"I would watch this film again, but when I finally got to see it the first time, I was severely disappoints.  The film is extremely sumptuous to look at and Burton's 1799 New York is remarkable, as are the torture chambers and the whole town of Sleepy Hollow.  The acting, too, is uniformly fine.  I would not expect Depp and Ricci to be speaking in accents, but the become almost unrecognizably absorbed into their characters, as do the character actors in support.  Unfortunately, the way the plot spun from the pen of B-movie maestro Kevin Yagher, in which in ends up, in its last third or so, a lame revenge plot with by the numbers mistaken attribution, discovery, and resolution, that I thought were so trite that I really didn't care.  Perhaps a more Brechtian acting style would have helped make it through this part, better, but the Delsartian performance of the culprit late in the film makes it silly.  Adherence to Irving was thrown out the window as a given as soon as it was announced, but what sounded like improvements turned out to be Hollywoodization, with little sense of parody, other than quoting _On the Town_.  In the story, Katrina married Brom van Brunt, who is here hacked in half by the Headless Horseman, though it is Brom who throws the pumpkin at Ichabod, something only hinted at on the last page of the story.  It would have been nice to see more action from Ray Park's Headless Horseman when he's attacking, but we don't seem to get all that much, while by the end he's acting like a lame pastiche of Burton's own _Batman_ in a lame pastiche of James Whale's _Frankenstein_.  Burton did that better when he was tongue-in-cheek in _Frankenweenie_.Unfortunately, this film resonated with me as all gloss and no substance, mainly due to the ending, because that really isn't the case, early on, even though it still could have used more depth.  It seemed saturated with references to Sam Raimi's Evil Dead films as well, which would be okay if it actually did something with that.  Burton also made strange choices as to when and when not to show a graphic decapitation, so that whenever one isn't shown, it seems anticlimactic.  The torture chambers and maltreatment of witches seems to be more of introducing a plot point than trying to say anything.  In short, were the ending less trite, this film would be a thoroughly entertaining, if relatively empty film  (even _Batman_ was deeper than this).  As such, it was a disappointment in several ways.  This is Burton's most beautiful, but least meaningful, film.",Sleepy Hollow

I find it ironic that when ""Saving Private Ryan"" is mentioned, people who have not seen it always mention the ""gore"", for it reknowned for being ""too bloody"" when blood is used only to enhance the realism of the action and at tha appropriate moments.  I think it is films like ""Sleepy Hollow"" that are too gory, splattering excessive amounts of blood around simply to be shocking or when the director can't think of any other way to create a jolt. I was especially disappointed to see the tired ""scary"" special effects in this film, the same ones that had been repeated many times in ""Beetlejuice"", a film that I have watched over and over and one of my favorites.
The good parts about this movie were Johnny Depp's acting and Danny Elfman's score.

So far this is a very good movie, Acting is well done, script and score. Johnny Depp is wonderful, kinda funny, surprising since this is supposed to be a horror film. Although they altered the story, like the headless horseman cant cross the bridge in the book, he does here, don't really care gives it more suspense. The opening scene kinda reminds you of Sweeney Todd, and when he lets the bird go, that reminds me of the street scenes from Sweeney Todd.Well written and done, im still watching this now, and i know that i won't be disappointed . Tim Burton really made his money on this film.",Sleepy Hollow
334,doctorow,Tim Burton's worst by far,2,25 November 1999,"A very weak movie. The special effect did not overcome the meandering plot. Also probably Johnny Depp's worst.  The most crassly commercial movie I have seen those two make. Not only did they include dream like flashbacks..which have almost nothing to do with the movie, they lift liberally from them in the trailers..so you get a very misleading idea of what the movie is about.

His dark dark sets and lighting are such a good fit for this plot, also Batman I and a couple of others...Frankenweenie was in B/W and this one could have been also.     Other than the creativily severed heads this could be a PG 13 film; little mayhem, excellent writing, finest actors, fine score.  Coherence and taste from start to finish.  An enormously satisfying movie and a 9/10 easily.  Both this and 6th Sense just wiped out American Beauty as best picture and I think the Academy lost a great deal of political credibility.",Sleepy Hollow

But this isn't a horror movie, it's the ultimate blending of all the creepy, macabre story-telling skills of Tim Burton. It doesn't matter whether he's changed the story, or given it a twist that the author never intended. Basically, it's Hound of the Baskervilles meets computer wizardry in a rollicking tale that grips and holds and leaves one breathless. Since it's all in good fun, an easy night's sleep follows. Wonderful for children of all ages.",Sleepy Hollow

I refer of course to the scene near the end of the movie where the skull of the Hessian horseman is returned to him and he reattaches it to his neck. The skull has fairly normal looking teeth, yet we clearly saw at the beginning of the movie that the horseman had filed his teeth to sharp points. To make things worse, when the newly attached skull has acquired an overgrowth of facial tissue, skin, hair, eyes and a tongue - lo and behold the teeth are once again filed into sharp points.",Sleepy Hollow
339,someguy889,Surprisingly Addictive,7,6 June 2004,"I went into this movie, having already seen Planet of the Apes, thinking that it was going to be another unsucessful Tim Burton movie, but I was surprised. Sleepy Hollow is strengthened by Burton's fantastic visual imagination and Johnny Depp's wonderfully pale performance. No wonder they always say ""From the imagination of Tim Burton comes a new film..."" because this ""horror"" movie could have easily sucked. However, this is a film more darkly beautiful and strangely humorous than it is scary. Miranda Richardson is the weakest part of the movie, and she makes the last 1/3 of the movie the worst part, but with an amazingly comic, out of breath Icabod Crane by Depp, and further strengthened if not outdone by Burton's images and the great score, Sleep Hollow can be considered a surprisingly addictive and enjoyable film. Sure, this is definitely not on the same level as Batman, Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, or Nightmare Before Christmas, but for what it sets out to do, it does surprisingly well. The last third of the movie is silly, granted, but it's hard to hate this movie.My grade: 7/10",Sleepy Hollow

Otherwise, watching great actors like Depp and Ricci wasted on a convoluted plot, flat-out stupid dialog, and even a few special effects right out of Pee Wee's Big Adventure, is quite disappointing. The tone is uneven, the music is in-your-face manipulative, and there are no characters to identify with. I wanted to like this movie. I saw it in an ideal situation, too: very first screening, midnight the night before it opened, at the Mann Chinese theater, nearly packed, ushered by actors dressed up like characters in the film, and free t-shirts given to all in attendance.",Sleepy Hollow
345,marlyly,Nowhere Near As Good As Some Reviewers Would Have You Think,2,4 October 2008,"This is the fourth collaboration between Johnny Depp and Tim Burton I have seen (the previous three being Sweeney Todd, the Corpse Bride and Edward Scissorhands) and I can say without an instance's doubt that it is easily the worst of the four. In fact, if it were not for Johnny Depp, then I would have stopped watching half an hour in to this poor excuse for a film.Lets me quickly outline the plot. Constable Ichabod Crane (Depp) has been called to the town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate the unusual murders of certain town folk, where they have had their head cut clean from their body. The town widely believe that the murders are being carried out by a headless horseman, but Crane is doubtful and wants to investigate further.Sound good? Trust me, the film's nowhere near that interesting. What I found really hard to get over was - what was this film meant to be exactly? The soundtrack would have you believe it's a scary horror - as would all the blood, headless corpses, skulls, torture weapons, y'know what I'm talking about, anything to build up atmosphere and suspense. But it fails, because this film just isn't scary, it isn't even gory (the blood looks ridiculously fake), in fact, I'd say it was Burton's aim to make us laugh, except there aren't even any jokes in the film. The special effects are just plain weird, and apart from Depp and Miranda Richardson the acting on whole is pretty dire. Christina Ricci may look the part but she cannot act, and the two child actors are just as dire (as is Lisa Marie as Ichabod's mother). It's surprising for a film to have so many badly acted parts, and I can only put this down to the fact that actors were chosen for appearance first, and acting skills second. Well, whatever the reason, one things for sure - whoever was in charge of the auditions seriously messed up.Another problem of mine with 'Sleepy Hollow' is how hard it is to follow what the hell is going on. Ichabod Crane seemed to come to conclusions regarding the investigation as if from nowhere (Oh look, a chemical reaction, the head was cut off in a single blow. This women was pregnant, the murderer must be a mad-man (you don't say!). Oh look, a tree with decapitated heads stored inside - this must be a portal to hell). Whaaaat?! Does Burton really assume that his audience is too thick to realise how ridiculous this logic is? I am really disappointed in this film. It was nothing like what I had expected, and a huge let down compared to the quality of other Johnny Depp and Tim Burton films. Do not be led astray by all these 5 star reviews - watch this film if you really want to, just don't expect the greatest film in the world. Or anything close.",Sleepy Hollow
346,rockproductions,I Lost My Head!,9,24 November 2012,"Fans of Tim Burton can do a lot worse than watch this film.Johnny Depp puts on one of his amusingly patented, cowardly heroic performances, as Ichabod Crane, the skinny pale weirdo detective from NYC, solving the headless horsemen case. As isolated dreary Sleepy Hollow, the town that surrounds him, is as strange & secretive as Ichabod & the Headless Horseman himself.Good to great performances abound, as one after the other important townsmen gets their heads lopped off in high fashion. Christopher Walken puts in one of his patented weirdo performances as the Headless Horseman! Short, sweet, & vicious! God love him! The script is fine for the chewing. The direction, darkly, bleakly, comedic, as the gorgeous dark cinematography graces your eyes glowing from the screen. A rich tapestry of dark hues & shades, contrasted by vividly bright hues, all in the right places, enhancing the viewing experience.A great film for Halloween, or any dreary grey day or stormy night.

347,cosmicfish14,A Guilty Pleasure Halloween Flick,7,11 October 2015,"We have now come to October, my favorite month of the year, which means I'll be reviewing horror films all throughout the month. Lets start it off with an adaptation of a classic story directed by Tim Burton, that adaptation being ""Sleepy Hollow.""Probably the best thing about this movie is it's visual style. It has a great Gothic, moody environment, a very classic horror feel to it all. It is the usual Tim Burton style. You can see it in the cinematography, the production design, in almost every frame you have these great visuals. Its to bad the rest of the movie wasn't as great.Its not that the rest of the movie was bad, it just it was justOK. The acting is fine and sometimes entertaining (Christopher Walken much), but it isn't anything all that notable. The music did serve the style of the film well, but it wasn't anything memorable. The story was somewhat unique (probably because it was written by the guy who wrote ""Se7en"") but not as strange or out there as some of Tim Burton's other movies. There were also some uses of CGI in the movie that were pretty bad, and I know that the film also has a bit of a cartoonish tone in some scenes, but even then the effects were still surprisingly bad.Even though I have been criticizing this movie for not being very unique, besides the visual aspect, I still find it very entertaining and I would definitely watch it for next Halloween. Its kind of a guilty pleasure movie, its technically kinda sloppy but still enjoyable. I'd compare it to my reaction to Jurassic World,I didn't think it was very unique, but it was enjoyable none the less.Final Score: 6/10",Sleepy Hollow
348,Zorro-3,"In this One Respect, It Went Too Far",2,27 August 2000,"WARNING! This may contain spoilers. In one of Jason's Friday the Thirteenth movies, after slashing his usual myriad of teens, Jason takes a wrong turn into a living room full of small children in their footie pajamas. He looks around, nervous and confused, and makes a hasty exit. He couldn't have been allowed to kill small children in a slasher like that. (In higher art, it could be debatable.)
But ""Sleepy Hollow"" was no higher art. It was a slasher with pretensions. It stole the title and main characters' names from THE great American classic, forever besmirching such names, and no doubt causing Mr. Irving to spin.And yet this cut-em-up did not have even the common courtesy, as Jason did, to turn away when presented with a small child.",Sleepy Hollow

Even if it's an R rated horror film such as ""Sleep Hollow"", you'll only be served with a horror comedy that can easily be watched by a 5 year old.Sleep Hollow is by no means a weak film, however, it does not do justice to the legend of Sleep Hollow. Like all Tim Burton's films, there's a child-like feel to it.It seems TB cannot produce a scary film. Not anyone's fault, but when I prepare myself to watch an old legend told as an R Rated film, I expect just that. Not just childish beheadings and a wooden performance by Jonny Depp.To each their own. Happy Halloween 2020.",Sleepy Hollow
350,BuddyBoy1961,A lot of fun if you don't expect too much,7,12 July 2000,"The ads promise that ""heads will roll""; this is decidedly not metaphorical. Indeed, from start to finish in ""Sleepy Hollow"" noggins are lopped off with alarming frequency. Tim Burton's sabbatical from directing (since 1996's befuddled ""Mars Attacks"") is gleefully broken by his take on the ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", in this instance a murder mystery that is only tangentially related to the Washington Irving classic. Depp is convincing as Ichabod Crane, a foppish constable devoted far more to ""cause and consequence"" than the paranormal. His reasoning is severely tested when charged with solving a series of mysterious and graphic murders in the eponymous hamlet in upstate New York. Confounding his analysis are clues defying scientific approach and his attraction to the ethereal Katrina (Ricci), leading him to suspect that the vengeance-driven 'Headless Horseman' is all too other-worldly. Not unexpectedly, Burton's reputation for evocative production design and photography is well-evidenced here. Awash in a spectrum of greyish hues resembling a charcoal drawing (save for occasional splashes of crimson), his vision of a spooky village and surrounding wood help serve an only-satisfactory tale of mayhem on the eve of the 19th century. Buoyed by a lively finale and spectacular stunt work by the 'Horseman' (Ray Park, who impressed as Darth Maul in ""Phantom Menace""), this edition of Sleepy Hollow is an amusingly creepy diversion.",Sleepy Hollow
351,magic_marker,"Well, Burton succeeded in what he was trying to do.....",6,20 August 2002,"which was to make a homage to the old British Hammer films of the 60s. The film could have been following a checklist:Does it have dark, gothic set design? CheckDoes it share a title with a work of classic literature? CheckDoes it bear absolutely no resemblence to said classic? CheckIs it instead a needlessly complicated whodunnit with an anticlimatic resolution? CheckAs far as costume design, does it think mainly of tight corsets straining to contain amply endowed women? CheckDoes it contain overwrought and melodramatic dialogue straight from a penny dreadful novel? CheckDoes it conain oodles of blood? CheckAnd Christopher Lee? CheckWith ""Sleepy Hollow"" Tim Burton forgets the cardinal rule of homage; refer but do not recreate. The film's main fault is that it is not so much a homage to Hammer horror as a carbon copy. Fidelity is not always a virtue, for while the film manages to capture all that was good about Hammer horror, it also manages to capture all that was bad.I have to say that ""Sleepy Hollow"" had one advantage over its source, there were moments in this film that were genuinely scary and suspensful, and I can't remember being scared once while watching any Hammer film. However, Hammer's failings ultimately undermine it. Most of the cast deliberately camped up their roles, and so did disservice to themselves (Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Christina Ricci, and Johnny Depp are all excellent actors and it is a bit depressing to see them as they are here) but Christopher Lee, who only appears briefly, reminds the world why he is and always has been the greatest conveyor of primal menace in the history of film; a fact Burton makes all the clearer by pairing him with his lesser modern counterpart, Christopher Walken. I find it interesting that Lee's career shot into the sky after this film was released.
Given its aims, ""Sleepy Hollow"" could be called a success. But since it was aiming so low I can really only call it a failure.",Sleepy Hollow

This film is scary, exciting, beautiful and thrilling. It is well made and the make up, the clothes, and the sound and visual effects are really good. Its script mixes action, fun, thriller and horror situations, and that makes the film absolutely great. It has it moments, some of them really funny. Some of the are also very scary. ""Sleepy Hollow"" tells the story of an American constable called Ichabod Crane who is sent by his boss to Sleepy Hollow, an isolated village, where he must investigate a series of murders committed by a supposed headless horseman.This film is very well acted.

There really wasn't any unless Johnny Depp fainting after every decapitation is funny.  Also, it had this story that kept getting more complicated and more stupid the longer it went along. It was supposed to be about the head (no pun intended) of some family getting rich off somebody's will or something. I don't know, I just wanted to see the horesman some more after a while.  The plot just lost me.  But the biggest flaw perhaps, was that we the audience don't ever care about any of these characters.  There was no emotion like that we've seen in the better Burton films.  So let me sum up, cold and unfeeling, very violent, not funny, and a confusing story.

He gives a classic story a new make-up and creates a wonderful atmosphere by adding to the fantastic set all the right colours, textures and music. His attention to detail and ritual make this a magical experience, a dark fairy tale. The cast are all superb, but it is Burton's screen alter ego, Johnny Depp, whose mesmerizing presence steals every scene. Let's admit it, the back of his hand is more expressive than some other actors' faces. His Ichabod Crane is not only endearing and intelligent, he is also involuntarily funny much of the time. And it is this sense of humour that lifts this movie above even the good ones of the genre. The moment when Crane finally meets the Headless Horseman face to... er... missing head, and faints, and afterwards, when he regains consciousness and tries to convince everybody of the existence of the demon - that's just pure brilliance. This is Tim Burton at his best, with a film that firmly belongs in my Top Ten.",Sleepy Hollow
356,ethanrunt,Tim Burton's greatest is the last one before the downfall!,6,4 February 2006,"I heard great things about Sleepy Hollow for years, but felt i was too young to watch it, but over the past few years i really got into classic Burton, Mars Attacks! Batman and Beetlejuice being the finest of them. A chance to watch another film of Tim Burton pairing up with Johnny Depp, probably the greatest, most underrated actor of all time still, stood ahead of me when it was to be shown on TV, and as a fan, i knew a Gothic horror film with lots of decapitations made by the greatest duo in Hollywood ever was impossible to miss.Set in England, the story follows a police constable going to a secluded English village to explore the mysterious beheadings said to be done by a fabled Headless horseman. This is all the story that it needs, though there are a lot of flashbacks, but what you need to know is that this is an extremely violent, camp, Gothic and funny. With hilarious decapitations, random horse chases and even a guy getting chopped in half and another one getting impaled and dragged through a window before being beheaded. A great cast, both English and American, makes this silly little Gothic romp one of the greatest films of our time, if your a fan of black humour, and if you like Tim Burton i guess you are.",Sleepy Hollow

For starters, it abandons the actual Sleepy Hollow myth - and we're not talking about a few artistic liberties here; it's a completely different, and somewhat inferior, story. The script is weak, confused, and can't even follow its own internal logic (I can't give you an obvious example, unfortunately - it's a spoiler), and one character (let's not say who) comes down with an unfortunate case of James Bond Villain Syndrome. If you see it - although I suggest you don't - you'll see what I mean.Tim Burton seems to have been so in love with the image of the gloomy forest and galloping horseman that he forgot about the rest of the movie.

Washington Irving would disagree with the plot, but he will have trouble denying that Burton has created the look for Sleepy Hollow he envisioned when he wrote it.

359,Mookie-21,Burton's best{tying with Batman},8,20 November 1999,"Not many directors can hit the Masterpiece mark more then once in their career. Not many hit it at all. So its even more amazing that a director hits it more then once. Burton has done that with this film. It is the most atmospheric and beautifully filmed movie I've ever seen. And the plot, while very confusing, is still understandable as long as one pays attention. Many have called the plot swiss cheese. Those tend to be those who can't understand. Sleepy Hollow, like Burton's other best{Batman and Edward Scissorhands} captures the imagination more effectively then most other directors. Burton is the Steven Spielberg of the macabre and unusual. He's a director of such brilliance. He knows exactly how it should look sound, and how it will work on a audience. Burton's look for Sleepy Hollow is as close to perfection as possible.Washington Irving may argue with the plot, but he can't deny that Burton has created the most eerie and amazing vision of Sleepy Hollow possible. Johnny Depp is excellent here. He gives Ichabod Crane so many levels that one really can't predict where he's going next. Christina Ricci is quite good as well. Casper Van Dien is actually quite good, of course he doesn't talk that much. His accent isn't bad. If you haven't heard who plays the Horsemen with a head, then I am not going to reveal it here. I will say this:It's quite an excellent choice, even if its kind of under done at times. This film is excellent.

This should be considered a true masterpiece not only for him but for the history of film. If he doesn't get any recognition for this movie i will be really shocked.Sleepy Hollow is a more gorier re-telling of the story of the Headless Horsemen. Icabod Crane(Johnny Deph) is sent to the town of Sleppy Hollow to find a killer who severes his victims heads and takes them. At first icabod doesn't believe in the horse-man until he sees him for hisself. He also meets a young girl named Katrina(Christina Ricci) who he becomes very attracted to. A lot of things follow and this becomes one of the best movies i have seen in a long while.The acting is really superb in this film. Johnny Deph is my favorite actor as of now. He is the most versatile actor in recent memory and he is always willing to take chances. he should really get something for this film because he trully brings icabod to life. Christina Ricci is also good as the innocent Katrina. She is one of the best younger actresses in hollywood and this is one of her best performances.Tim Burton again, i bow in your prescence. He is a true visonary and fora lack of a better word a cinematic genius.The Music is also superb.

361,spinin,Sleepy...,6,29 November 1999,"From the early moments, ""Sleepy Hollow"" grabbed my attention. I was immediately taken in by the story. The dark and somber tone set by Tim Burton in many of his previous films was just as evident in the beginning here. Several elements were working together to create an intriguing movie.The design was almost perfect. The colors that made up the background were washed out to a near black and white. Like he has done many times before, Burton gave a lifelike appearance to trees, as well as, houses. The eerie look of the forest was picture perfect. A nearly everlasting darkness was captured with excellent cinematography. The story itself was building up and the acting was strong. Johnny Depp produced a great mix of humor, intelligence, and girlish fear. It was the perfect setting for such a terrifying character as the headless horseman. Burton found a way to strike the audience with fear and managed to find time for some dark comedy in between. This was shaping up to be a classic horror film. I could tell I was going to enjoy this film all the way through.I was wrong.Everything falls apart in the second half. The story becomes too complicated, although not confusing. The idea of a ""conspiracy theory"" is not fitting. The movie loses its edge and the mood it sets by turning into an average crowd-pleasing blockbuster. Although it didn't bother me, the horseman chops off about 10 heads too many. I actually enjoyed that and found that rather funny. Christopher Walken is funny in this movie and I'm not making fun of him. Several chase scenes and explosions follow. It doesn't look like a Tim Burton movie after a while. I lost my initial interest and actually found myself thinking about other things while watching the final 20 minutes or so. Whatever is built up in the first half, it's destroyed in the second.The movie is worth seeing for what it creates in the early stages. The cinematography and settings of this film remain beautiful. Johnny Depp portrays Crane very effectively. However, the story falls apart and reaches a simple resolution filled with explosions. All good elements are drowned out. I just find the second half too disappointing. Overall a 6 out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow

363,bonnie91,A Superb Version of Washington Irving's Classic Horror Story,10,6 May 2006,"The movie, Sleepy Hollow, embodies Tim Burton's unique take on one of the most well-known horror tales of all time, with a few new plot twists and greater character development, including a dark past for Ichabod Crane and a ""story behind the story"" of what's going on in the haunted town, which is beautifully rendered, dark and foggy for an eerie atmosphere.The dream cast puts in great performances, but obviously it's Johnny Depp who steals the show with his intuitive and sometimes over-the-top portrayal of the anti-hero, Ichabod Crane, who displays admirable bravery while at the same time often succumbing to fear.The lavish production, masterful acting, background music, beautiful periodic sets and costumes and the careful attention to detail, most notable in the special effects used to bring the headless horseman ""to life"", if you will, all come together to tell the tale of Sleepy Hollow's plight and deliverance as it's never been told before. It's unlikely that this cinematic version will ever be surpassed. Superb!",Sleepy Hollow
364,up2u,Tim Burton's best movie,7,28 November 1999,"I didn't feel that way at first, but in retrospect I really do think it's his best movie. The plot is secondary to the visuals, but it's done well. Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci give thoughtful, romantic performances as a detective from New York City and the beautiful villager he falls for while investigating a series of gruesome murders the town believes is being executed by a faceless spectre riding on a horse. Whilst everything he knows as a scientist falls down around him, his love for her and her faith in him remain constant. And this is not the innocent Sleepy Hollow of Washington Irving's tale-- this is a farmtown overflowing with adultery, witchcraft, and murder. 	And THEN, there are the visuals. The film is filled with images that are vintage Burton: Ichabod (Depp) puts on investigating glasses, and the left lens is twice the size of the right; the staggering Tree of the Dead, whose branches twist in grotesque angles and stream with blood; and the Horseman himself, who lops off heads cleanly and with precision, has a decidedly otherwordly style. 	Overall, this is a gorgeous film brimming over with high comedy and winning romance. The identity of the person in cahoots with the Horseman is no big surprise, but getting there is the fun in this.",Sleepy Hollow
365,sailor-28,A simple film revisiting a classic story plot.,7,29 November 1999,"When one wonders just how good a film can be when you take out the excessive gore and brutality, one can see that some films are still good.  Sleepy Hollow is an example where avoiding excessive special effects, and relying on simple acting can be an effective combination.  The plot is from the old classic novel.  This film takes on a moderate pace and is fairly sterile of the modern social pollution, although one routinely sees that every actress under the age of 40 is wearing a wonderbra and exposing her chest as if it were fashionable.  I can't say that the film was too difficult to relate with, which must mean that the acting was fair or adequate.  The special effects of the headless horseman galloping down the foggy countryside was excellent.  There is little more to the story that has yet to be developed. It is obvious that the novel was not really written for film, but it produced a mildly entertaining result when it was re-created for this film.",Sleepy Hollow

A CREEPY killer, a creepy setting and a creepy plot. The setting is magnificent and the art direction was the best of the year. Sleepy Hollow was a great setting because they never got any sunlight and it looked majorly depressing and deadly. A creepy sort of fog was always appearing. Now, Ichabod Crane was the big mistake the movie made. He was a psycopathic lunatic who probably should have been thrown in the Sleepy Hollow asylum. His voice was high and stupid sounding while his tactics were pathetic. The horseman should have come after him the first chance he got. The plot of the movie tied in with a strange event that happened about thirty years before when a beheading criminal was executed in the forest in front of two apparently ANGELIC young girls. Then it takes off from there, the horseman killing old men to six year old boys hiding underneath floorboards. You will definitely like Sleepy Hollow if you're a horror fan, but if you're not you won't care how Ichabod got the strange marks on his hands or why the horseman only kills certain people...",Sleepy Hollow

His Icabod Crane shows that he is an actor of the highest caliber, not a ""star""I loved Tim Burton's lighting, you can feel the cold, damp chill in the air.

369,Eva Ionesco,A brilliant masterwork of gothic fantasy,10,2 January 2000,"The cinematography in this film is the best I've seen in a movie. Every scene is a gothic work of art, and it's worth seeing just for that alone. It also features the brilliant and charismatic actors Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, and a fantastic gothic score by master musician Danny Elfman. Put it on your ""Must See"" list!I have to give this film a ten out of ten because it thoroughly deserves it. Personally, I would have preferred Depp to have played his role seriously, rather than as a parody, but because I know others will enjoy it all the more for that, and because the film is so perfect in other ways, it would not be fair for me to reduce it from its ten points just for that one personal preference.For those who don't already know, the story involves a headless horseman who has risen from the dead, and rides through the countryside wielding a sword and cutting off other people's heads, in revenge for losing his own. In this version of the story, there are more details than the other film versions, giving the story a more interesting plot.The original story was a poem by Washington Irving (1783-1859) called ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"". Some scholars believe that the poem was based on a story by Karl Musäus (1735-1787), a German academic writer, who was among the first to collect and write down German folktales. If Irving didn't get the idea from the German folktale, the similarity is remarkable.Although heads are cut off, in gory detail, please don't be put off from seeing the film because of that. It's done more like a nightmare fantasy, rather than realistically, so every teenager and adult would be able to watch it without difficulty, though it's certainly not for children. I would strongly urge everyone to see this wonderful film.",Sleepy Hollow

I was actually disappointed, because I was anticipating a very good couple of hours spent watching this. I noticed that the top reviews on this site were all positive. Besides, this is a Tim Burton film, and his Edward Scissorhands is one of my favorite films; and a few days ago I saw Ed Wood and that's a very good Burton film, too, although not on the level of Edward Scissorhands (IMO). I will say this movie looks good. Better than good actually. I must give credit where credit is due. An Academy Award went to Best Art Direction and Set Direction. To be honest, Academy Awards hold no value to me anymore, as it's mostly politics (and not my kind), but I guess the art direction hasn't yet been politicized.A missed opportunity was that there wasn't anything done with the Dutch element of the story, except maybe the visuals (I recognized some Dutch architecture). From the start, it became clear that this movie was going to be superficial entertainment, made for the big screen. I didn't care for the story, nor for the characters. This is because they were cardboard or even illogical. Was there supposed to be a love story involved? Didn't work at all.",Sleepy Hollow

372,Kilroy-17,This film was worth the wait...,8,19 November 1999,"I've been looking forward to this picture for a long time and it didn't disappoint at all.  By far, the best Tim Burton film so far.  I loved Ed Wood, and I was pleased to see Martin Landau make a cameo in the opening scene.Johnny Depp is very entertaining as Ichabod Crane, and the rest of the cast puts in good performances as well.  Burton maintains his usual darkness about this movie, just as with most of his others.  And it works to perfection in the setting of the small town of Sleepy Hollow surrounded by the seriously creepy forest. But make no mistake about it, the horseman carries this story, and he does not disappoint.  Crane sets out to discover who is killing people in Sleepy Hollow, but he soon finds out that what the people have been telling him is true.  The murderer is a demon on horseback with no head.  The question then becomes why?  This movie gets right to it, and then it doesn't stop until all is clear.  I would like to have seen Christopher Walken get a few lines though.  He is so compelling that even his smallest performances can stay with you for a long time.  Even still, you will not be disappointed in this one.",Sleepy Hollow
373,RobT-2,"Not perfect, but very, very close",6,31 March 2000,"First of all, the so-so parts: While Christina Ricci's cool portrayal of Katrina gives the character an appropriately otherworldly aura, she really could have used more fire at emotional moments.  Some scenes are unduly rushed, including a few with crucial exposition, making the plot hard to follow at some points.  Finally, Danny Elfman's music is too intrusive at times, distancing viewers when they should be drawn in.That's ALL that's wrong with this picture; everything else is perfect or nearly so.  Tim Burton's films are always visually rewarding, and this one has terrifically moody atmosphere.  Having lived in hilly, wooded areas close to rivers and creeks, I can testify that there are indeed places that look and feel a lot like the Sleepy Hollow of this movie.  Many scenes have so little color that they might almost as well be in black-and-white; this makes the few splashes of color (flames, witchcraft symbols, and of course blood) much more striking.  One understands how the movie got an Oscar for art direction.The plot, which as you probably know varies drastically from Washington Irving's original story, is diabolically complex and closer to a mystery/thriller than horror as such.  It reminded me of the fiction of Avram Davidson, a noted fantasist with a penchant for complex mystery plots.Anyway, back to the movie.  Except for the rushed scenes alluded to above, Burton handles the plot (perhaps the most complex in any of his movies) with exceptional grace, dropping in telling visual details along the way that come back in unexpected places later on.  I especially liked the underlying theme about science vs. superstition, and note that while many details of this particular case lie beyond the realm of science, it is still science and reason that crack the case open in the end.  The bits of ca. 1800 cutting-edge (so to speak) technology were fascinating as well; my favorites were the magic lantern that threw lighted shapes on the walls, and the thaumatrope toy which combined pictures of a bird and a cage.  (It's probably not a coincidence that both of these are ancestors to the motion picture.)Finally, I loved Johnny Depp's performance as Ichabod Crane.  Even though the character's situation and background were quite different from Irving's version, Depp, Burton, and scriptwriters Kevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker remain true to the spirit of the original Ichabod Crane.  He could almost be a Buster Keaton-type character, an awkward wimp who accomplishes great feats of derring-do by the end of the movie, and for me Depp's portrayal recalls ""Sherlock, Jr."", in which Keaton dreams that he is the world's greatest detective.  Even though Irving wrote no sequels to ""Sleepy Hollow"", I'd love to see more of this film version of Ichabod Crane; while the movie looks great and has a terrific script, it's Depp and Crane who put it over the top.",Sleepy Hollow
374,mbloxham,"headless plot, wasted actors.",2,28 January 2001,"A screenplay appropriate to the teenage male, and very likelywritten by one: half-begun themes (principle, torture, witchcraft)sacrificed to cheap special effects (how many heads do we reallyhave to see roll?). Any stroke of axe or Heath Robinson devicespurts blood precisely into the wielder's face; yet the level of gore(blood spurting from each nailhole of a victim of the iron Maiden) ismarginally too great to support the only kind interpretation of thisfilm, that it is supposed to be funny. Lines of development sopoorly handled that characters must stop and catch the audienceup with the plot, as in some detective farce.And what a romp it might have been: rarely can so many greatactors - for the supporting cast is potentially superb - have stoodaround with so little to do. Not including Mr Depp, kept very busy,who equates acting with swallowing to express fear, etc etc,unfunny and untrained in pastiche, inadequate to attempting thethemes that first informed this abandoned script.Kudos to the headless horseman, for twirling his axe in the onlyact of real gusto in a long evening.

Unlike some horror films, who try to be overly important or be deep, this film just takes you along for a ride, being careful to let you make a few calls. Also, it doesn't slip into the slasher film either. thats not to say there is not gore, but its not senseless ""see how much blood we used"" gore.

It is a must-see for every gothic/morbid person.Many people said the story was poor, and there was little development of the characters. The story was very good. It was somewhat complicated, but not over-the-top, with both humorous and serious dialog. The story combined comedy with horror in a perfect blend to satisfy the comedian or the gothic person. The script and plot were very well-written, with a unique story, that was very much improved from the original Legend of Sleepy Hollow.Tim Burton is under-appreciated as a director. The sets were dream-like with a nice gothic feel. The movie, except for the dream sequences, have a black-and-white appeal with well-blended periodic additions of color during Ichabod's dreams. But it's never too dark or foggy to see what's going on, which is rare for a movie like this.This movie was, in my opinion, better than the Disney version. It is much bloodier, the special effects are fantastic. There is no gore and very little sexuality, and I think the movie deserved a PG 13 rating, definitely. R is just too high a rating, it wasn't that bad with typical R-movie characteristics. The blood and decapitation never goes over the top.The horseman scenes were dramatic and well shot, also.

381,missrljane,Depp saves a sleepy and hollow fantasy flick,5,10 April 2008,"Despite a creepy atmosphere and a likable and amusing performance by Johnny Depp as the squeamish Constable Crane, Sleepy Hollow isn't as enjoyable as it has the potential to be due to too much conspiracy and not enough of anything else.Ichabod Crane believes in using scientific methods to uphold truth and justice and is sent to the isolated farming community of Sleepy Hollow to detect the murderer who has been beheading victims. This will put his methods to the test. A test he presumably fails, as he is faced with the truth that the supernatural exists, and the stories that the villagers tell of a ghostly headless horseman coming to kill them is proved true. A shame, because a scientific solution to the inbred community's superstition looked like it would have been an interesting plot. And while Depp's constantly scared performance is entertaining, it doesn't make much sense for a man who is a policeman interested in cutting open bodies. And for a man so intent on fact and reason, he very quickly changes his tune when he sees the headless horseman and is suddenly an expert on ghosts and magic.Everyone, even those not part of the conspiracy at the centre of the plot, acts suspiciously and guilty at all times, and the conspiracy, filled with too many red herrings and half uttered statements, is very hard to follow. Also, the villain is unfortunately easily guessed from the billing order. As for the headless horseman, he is strangely treated sympathetically, despite having been a mass-murdering loon in life, and a brutal assassin in death who kills at least one, possibly more, victims without orders.Christina Ricci gives the worst performance of the film as the bland love interest Katrina, trundling out her lines as if she has no idea what they mean. It comes across as if Ricci, a normally vibrant actor, is deliberately sabotaging her role as revenge for being cast as such a dull character.Sleepy Hollow is funny, exciting and scary when it's good, but too many dull characters, an irritating sleepiness to important events and a needlessly convoluted plot get in the way. For a film based on a short story in which the headless horseman didn't even exist, the writers have gone far too over the top to come up with a replacement narrative. This would be one to miss if it wasn't for Johnny Depp giving a career-best performance.",Sleepy Hollow

You can say that this film has a classic theme and it's correct. It's all about revenge and based on a vengeance story but Tim Burton does that in very comic and intense way. He manages to find a way to narrate a very familiar theme by using his own style and surreal characters but yet so real. He puts some sense of humor, action and horror in it and it turns to be a very good movie.I gotta say this, the character of Ichabod Crane is very well written. Needless to say, Johnny Depp is so awesome in the role. He did really an incredible job and bring that fiction character come to life. The scenes which Mr. Crane is petrified with fear when he sees The Headless Horseman for the first time and he is really afraid of spider are priceless. Christina Ricci is good too but got used to her as Wednesday Addams and all black clothes and everything, seeing her to play the role of young, pure and innocent daughter that is really awkward to be honest lol.In summary, go on and watch this movie.

Well, dark and creepy it certainly is, but absorbing and powerful it unfortunately is not. This film promises a lot from the beginning, but it sadly fails to convert all the elements into a cohesive whole. The plot is tangled and clumsy and hardly does justice to the elegant legend of Ichabod Crane and his headless Nemesis. In the end it is scarcely of interest who inherits what and who is trying to bop off whom. The characters, apart from the very interesting' Ichabod Crane, played with just the right amount of self-parody by Johnny Depp, are dull and sloppily drawn and the film needs a good juicy villain to spice things up a bit and balance the ensemble. Depp is an inspired piece of casting and really makes this film almost worth seeing, although he limits his facial expressions to the fingers of one hand. This is however five more than those managed by Christina Ricci, who struggles both with her character and the period setting throughout and really looks totally out of place. The other characters are unremarkable. I am sure Tim Burton could have pulled something special off here, but he has a poor script to work with, and somewhere in this production he realizes it and loses faith. Even the themes of science vs magic, city versus country, reason over emotion, are introduced but never developed properly and the whole thing just peters out about halfway through. The film felt long even though it was well under two hours.The photography and the production design save it from total disaster, though. Both these are terrific, and the effects are gruesome but appropriate. Such a pity that the story and characters do not live up to the setting. As they say, fifty percent script, thirty percent casting, and then there's the rest. Well, the rest isn't enough here.Could have been, but isn't . . .",Sleepy Hollow

I found the Ninja-style twirling of the weapons silly. The costume warn by the horseman, who was supposedly a Hessian mercenary, bore no resemblence to any uniform worn by Hessians, mounted or not, during the American Revolution.Depp's character seemed to vacilate from inept and bumbling one moment to bold and capable the next.

That is the extent of my experience with Tim Burton. I don't often need to take the role of lemming upon me, but I'm left without choice.""Sleepy Hollow"" once again merely is a mask of visual creativity, unmasked however there's little pleasing about this, and every other, Burton film. The script flaunts a shocking lack of intelligence. The film's half and half divided between dark comedy and mystery, the first an instinctive like or dislike, the second an objective fail. Especially the final twist falls flat, the cliché scenes where the villain points out the exit of the plot's labyrinth in an overly long expose hardly possesses any punch due to the insufficiently explored characters (betrayal isn't much of a heart breaker when there's no real trust established to begin with), and the web of clues' only goal appears to be confusing the audience(did Burton really expect us to remember all the names of a dozen characters who've hardly registered on screen due to lack of screen time and unmemorable dialog). Burton's rendition of 'Ichabod Crane' is not so much ""some scarecrow eloped from a cornfield"" (see Washington Irving's Classic Horror Story) as another self-aware, colorful for the sake of being colorful, character, though it's not hard to imagine him filled with hay(why do so many mystery films insist on selecting the dullest, most devoid of personality character as the mirror through which we view the story, rendering it less quirky?).Elfman's score complements the pert visual style, the film's strongest suit beyond a shadow of a doubt. Opting for an almost b&w look (same as Sweeney Todd), he succeeds at injecting the blood shedding scenes with more vivacity. It's the strongest argument for why I feel Sleepy Hollow leans a lot closer towards a comic book film than a Gothic horror story adaptation.Although I can't put my heart into recommending this film, checking out the scenes involving Christopher Walken's headless horseman may just be enough argumentation to give this movie one look.",Sleepy Hollow

Johnny Depp is as usual well cast for this quirky role and there is good support from less well known actors (although the Headless Horseman is played by Christopher Walken. Interestingly, he looks a little like Depp). But this Tim Burton rendition tries to be very complex in plot and character with unusual and original spins, yet ultimately fails to deliver. The brave Ichabod inexplicably has certain phobias which do not play consistently and a troubled past that we can only guess about from his surrealistic dreams. The love interest is rushed - we wonder where Depp's character gets his passion. In a Showtime post-interview he talked about how he based Ichabod Crane on several characters from the classics and horror films of old.

394,kirkwuk,Could have been a family movie,5,16 February 2006,"Tim Burton has made a few adult movies but I fear this one went down the wrong tunnel. For one Sleepy Hollow reminded me of Edward Scissorshands with its snowy landscapes and odd fantastic sets, and of course Depp. That Burton felt the need to add dozens of forced graphic decapitation shots was the only thing that spoilt what could have been a spectacular family movie. The headless horseman was a great concept, but sadly he does little but take off head upon head whilst the rest of the cast figure out what's going on, before he strikes in typically predictable fashion. The climax is a little abrupt and felt a bit comic-like and unrealistic to me (Burtons niche is allowing fantasy films to show realism and convincing story lines without too much ridicule).Sleepy Hollow isn't too bad a film, it just isn't that good. It feels too empty to encourage watchers to see if they missed anything on a second watch.",Sleepy Hollow
395,humpback,more laughs than horror,8,26 February 2000,"I have to admit, I am not actually a big fan of Tim Burton. but..... this movie is far better than I expected.First of all, it is as stylishly throughout and with some nice, grotesque teasers ( Icabud Crane's ""surgery"" implements seem to have come right from the 'Edward Scissorhands' set ) and very consequent camerawork, both with regard to lighting, viewing angles, cuts and a deliberately limited palette of colours used, as one has come to expect of Burton, whatever else his directing shortcomings ( if any) may be. Visually it is an all too rare treat of shadows and pale, misty light, giving it a chilly and menacing atmosphere. This is almost worth the ticket on its own.The story itself though is far more comedy ( and some suspense) than horror - there is little gore ( some bouncing heads, some beheaded corpses and some blood spurting from off-camera are the upper limits - slasher-movie types need not apply....), very little shock ( The  - btw excellent - soundtrack usually gives ample advance warning ) and nothing ultimately disgusting. There are some slightly unsettling and eerie flashbacks, giving a little depth to CraneÄs obsession with science over 'mere' belief. As to the nature of the horror though, there is little question, and only the motive for its appearance, while eluded too quite early in the film, stays unknown for any amount of time. Any horrific transformation of the characters ? De nada, senor !So folks, lets face it, it's NOT a horror movie ( unless ones DOES regard 'X-files' as horror.... ), merely ghostly suspense, with, perhaps its single fault, an overdose of relieving humour. There is quite a lot of comically grotesque scenes which will make the viewer laugh - typical for Burton's films, but not really (?) appropriate in a spooky and dark ghost story.
Its a clichee-rich story, too - spooky witches, cursed woods, innocent pale girls, frigid stepmothers, Jack O'Lanterns and cornfields, as well as black stagecoaches all have their turns. Actually, that is the most disappointing part of the film, as there are very little innovative details in the telling and 'painting' the darkness of the tale.The cast is a superior one, Depp and Ricci giving able, if not really inspired performances, Christopher Walken having a few short, but very impressive scenes and several well known faces turning up in supportive roles - even Christopher Lee 'dropping-in' in a cameo, so no quibbles on that count.Actually I liked the film very much - just do not expect it to be a 'horror' film - suspense with some mystical overtones and a good, hearty laugh at some blackish humour is much more appropriate as a description. 8 out of 10 should give you an idea as to its quality.......",Sleepy Hollow

400,frostyfrog,Sleepy Hollow,5,26 August 2020,"Sleepy Hollow is basically the movie ""The Adventures Of Ichabod and Mr. Toad"" except people getting impaled, mutilated and violently decapitated for adult pleasure... and also it's not as good. Look, if you watched any of Tim Burton's films, you know the gyst of most with dark color palettes utilized in the cinematography, gothic production design and incredibly creative effects, especially in the stop motion films. Those are all present here but alongside a rather interesting story. In the original animation, Ichabod Crane is a decent guy who is after Katrina Van Tassel for her wealth and competes with Brom Bones for her affection. In that film the Headless Horseman is a tale told by Brom at a party that scares Ichabod and when he's attacked by the horseman later, it's unclear whether or not Brom Bones was the attacker due to the horse. That ambiguity adds an air of mystery to the story on whether or not the legends exist which in my mind was very effective. Now this is a children's cartoon short from the fourtys so the characters are simple, the art is simple and as implied by the word short it is brief. Sleepy Hollow has to deal with the challenge of taking this short story and stretching it out to feature length. It started this by altering Ichabod Crane's character to a constable who is trying to argue for fair trial in court and steering away from torture devices due to a past trauma. However the court sends him to Sleepy Hollow to put his scientific theories to the test to help catch the Headless Horseman who has murdered three people. From here, the film turns into a combination of a horror, thriller and mystery as Ichabod attempts to try and determine who the killer is and in the process, promote the truth. The story is equal parts predictable and unpredictable, there are obvious dream sequences, an obvious villain reveal and of course within those dream sequences, a great tribute to the original animation but that's it. The film doesn't focus on Ichabod's relationship with Brom and Katrina so much as they do on everyone's relationships with one another. I just gotta say, it doesn't work at all considering many of the characters in this film are over the top and the tone of the film constantly changes from serious to cheesy. The red herrings were well executed but they altered the original material a whole lot. I like the ambiguity of the originals ending and the fact that not all of the characters were solid people, they were all dickheads. In this film there are glimpses of that in certain characters but they often rode the line for much of the film. A more simple approach to the telling of this legend is effective and to be honest it might not be able to tell a good version by stretching it out. Look at the Grinch and tell me why that short hasn't gotten a good live action film. The film at the length it was at was incredibly convoluted on occasion due to the constant twisting and turning at that length. It just simply doesn't work stretching short stories out most of the time. The performances are fine, Johnny Depp did a decent job and so did the others but no stand outs. The pacing was solid only in the terms that this film needed each scene in order to tell the story completely. From the terms that I mentioned previously though, not great. Even revisiting certain scenes as the mystery builded to add context which was fun to see. The music, effects, and production design really help this film out though. This film had a score wrote by Danny Elfman during his prime which was a treat. Elfman had composed other brilliant scores for film's like the Spider-Man trilogy with Toby Maguire. I think what works the most about Elfman's scores is that they promote this air of wonder when characters did extraordinary things and also draws audiences right into the action during fight sequences or tense climatic moments. It's a shame this style of score isn't as incredible now since we've experienced it so often. I know Elfman still writes scores but my god, I don't know for which films recently. The effects were pretty solid for 2006 CGI and I was pleasantly surprised. If fans were seeing this film for the pure gore and violence than these effects were for them. The blood seemed real enough and the characters movements all seemed real enough. The production design was solid just like Burton productions usually are and it lived up to the standard. Despite solid elements though, I can't say I fully enjoyed this film or was annoyed by it either as the inconsistent story, mediocre acting and shoddy pacing equally matching the decent music, effects and production design. It was full meh. Which was a shame because this legend could've been more but on the same token it could've been less. I hate film reviews of mediocrity. I'm gonna give Sleepy Hollow a five out of ten.",Sleepy Hollow
401,blackbanter,"Atmospheric and beautiful, but at points rushed""",8,3 November 2019,"I had a blast with ""Sleepy Hollow"", it is a super fun ride from start to finish, and, although flawed and ridden with goofs, it manages to be entertaining all the way through.
One of the main positives I have are the actors and their performances, Johnny Depp was fantastic, along with many other notable figures.
""Sleepy Hollow"" is extremely atmospheric and really manages to capture the feel of a creepy town plagued by a monstrous headless horseman.
Although it has many positives, it also has some negatives, like Crane's reason for going to Sleepy Hollow feeling rushed, the romance not being at all captivating and the editing towards the last part getting pretty bad for a bit.Overall a very enjoyable Halloween experience.B-",Sleepy Hollow

Christina Ricci is extremely easy on the eyes and the time period in which the movie is set makes the movie all that much mysterious. there's a serious twist at the end that keeps the viewer captivated. the story is very complex so this the genre of the movie can be classified under mystery /horror.

The story centers around Constable Ichabod Crane (Johny Depp) as he goes to the small farming vilage of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of decapitations.  At first he refuses to belief what the community heads (notice my word usage) say that the victoms were kiled by a phantom horse man with no head.

Eventually they send the horseman to hell along with Lady Van Tassle and they all live happily ever after.Most of the acting, aside from Depp's, is pretty crummy, but, since this is a Burton-flick, the visual styles are increadible.

I'm no history buff, but I remember reading ghost tales when i was young, and this is precisely what I was imagining!This isn't a good story for younger children, unlike other Burton films, I believe they will find it too disturbing.

Tim Burton does it again, what can I say.  With Edward Scissorhands, Batman, The Nightmare Before Christmas, and now Sleepy Hollow, he has a nice bag of films under his belt that he should be very proud of.  Burton has the ability to be so creative in so many different ways that only a microscopic amount of directors can do.  A perfect example is the animation in The Nightmare Before Christmas (if you haven't seen that yet, what are you waiting for!).

417,Leahcurry,An admirable version of a classic story (there may be a spoiler),9,28 March 2000,"""Sleepy Hollow"" is a very well-done film that deserves to be recognised. The acting is excellent through and through. Johnny Depp excellently plays the superstitious (and humorously frightened) Constable Ichabod Crane, and Christina Ricci is even more excellent as his love interest Katrina Van Tassel. If anyone is not expecting this film to be different than the Washington Irving novel and the Disney cartoon, well, it is, and far more detailed. It had to be, in order to make this movie full-length. For instance (this could be a spoiler), The Headless Horseman (excellently played by Christopher Walken) is controlled. But every new plot element is NEEDED in this film, and none are unnecessary! The art direction (and the acting, again) is marvellous. Even the sky is gray until the end. The gore level is low and the comic relief (mostly by Johnny Depp) makes the movie seem less scary (by the way, it is not very scary for the most part, but that's OK). Also, one can certainly read the novelette and see the Disney cartoon (and enjoy both) before or after they see this movie. There is absolutely NOTHING wrong with each version. I read the book shortly before I first saw this movie (I've seen the movie 3 times since before Thanksgiving), and have always loved the cartoon ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", which is very much like the novel. The novel is somewhat wordy and can be hard to follow, so I only suggest one reads it if they like tackling hard stuff. Otherwise, go ahead and enjoy these three classics!",Sleepy Hollow
418,Primate84,excellent!!,8,14 April 2001,"I consider this to be Tim Burton's best movie ever, except for maybe ""Batman"". It only had a couple of small flaws, which I will list now, so as to save the good stuff for last: 1. Many of the fine supporting actors should have been given more screen time, particularly Casper Van Dien and Richard Griffiths. Both of their characters should have been given bigger parts. 2. There is one part of the movie that I didn't get:In the scene when the Horseman goes after that family (a scene that offended many reviewers), why did Tim Burton feel the need to have him go after their young son as well? You find out later why he went after the parents, but he had no reason to try and kill that poor child. However, these two small problems are more than outweighed by the many strong points of this film, which I will now list: 1. Danny Elfman's score. I don't get why any reviewers could be put off by his excellent music. I love how he combined the various types of music which he used in Mr. Burton's other films. By this, I mean that he used scary, thrilling tunes like in ""Batman"", ""Batman Returns"", and ""Beetlejuice"" during certain scenes (such as Ichabod's terrifying encounter with the Crone in the Western Woods, and during the final chase scene), yet in other scenes (like the flashback sequences and the film's final end scene) he made haunting, beautiful melodies like the kind you heard in ""Edward Scissorhands"". 2. The costumes/ makeup/set design. The costumes were beautifully accurate, and they should have won the Oscar for Costume Design instead of ""Topsy-Turvy"". The makeup was great, particularly for the scenes when you see the Horseman's real face. You almost couldn't tell that it was Christopher Walken, because the makeup made him look so scary. Tim Burton has created his own little world with the sets. He actually had the village completely constructed, and the Western Woods looked even better, with the dried leaves and the gnarled dead trees everywhere. I'm glad that this movie won at least one Oscar due to the set design. 3. Johnny Depp's performance. I LOVED what he did with Ichabod Crane, and he performed with complete perfection. During the scene when he questions the Notary, he reminded me of Sherlock Holmes. He should have won more awards for his performance. So, basically, if you have a strong stomach, I highly recommend that you see this great movie.",Sleepy Hollow

Sleepy Hollow is unique in it's own, dark way. It delivers a sense of a horror/thriller film, and a comedy. Some people don't like those two genres mixed together, but honestly for this film, it works. Johnny Depp and Ichabod Crane is the best. Johnny Depp has his role. I'll never forget him as the dark, sensitive detective, researching the case of the Headless Horseman. Christina Ricci-I've never seen her scarier or more good-looking. She gives this feel of romance and light, as well as a dark, witch-crafty feeling. In all, the film is great. Tim Burton made one of his finest films.

420,Nedla24,"Well Executed, but not spectacular",6,28 November 1999,"I always believed that movie critics accentuated too much on the negative aspects of movies.  Therefore I want to acknowledge the good aspects of this movie.  First is Tim Burton's direction.  He is able to create the perfect mood for the movie, frightening and simultaneously ridiculous.  It is beautifully photographed.  The ensemble actors suit the time period so well, they appear to be oil paintings instead of people.  Danny Elfman's beautifully dark and complex score is a perfect match to the action at all times.  However, Depp carries this movie on his charismatic shoulders.  His driven yet cowardly Ichabod Crane is strangely riveting.  Ricci also flashes her acting talent as well as her haunting eyes to create a vulnerable and curious character.  But there are many flaws in this movie.  The plot is interesting, but the dialogue is subpar and the love interest between Katrina and Ichabod has no basis.  We are supposed to believe that they fall in love, ""Just Because"". Many major plot elements are thrown in simply to create mood, such as the story of Ichabod's mother.  Some other elements are simply unnecessary gore and disturbing material.  I will not even touch upon the total ignorance of Washington Irving's original short story.  Let us say that it was changed enough that if Irving were alive today, they could have skipped out on the royalties.  However this is an above average movie, and has many scary moments.  Bottom Line, it's worth $7.50 if you just want to see a movie, but don't go out of your way.",Sleepy Hollow

A modern-day film-noir that pulls together every element of film-making in a manner that would make themasters like Hitchcock and Welles jealous.  Every bit of this films masterwork exists in the set design, art direction, cinematography and the haunting original score by Danny Elfman.  This is not to belittle the efforts of the director and the actors, but to reiterate the fact that Sleepy Hollow drives on the visuals that create the entire feel of the film.  The acting is worth note.   The cast includes some of today's well known british actors.  The villain, crafted by Christopher Walkin, is less than well acted but understandable as the character is limited which gave him little breadth to build more interest for the Hessian outside of him being headless. Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp deliver good performances that meld nicelytogether.  The rest of the cast plays nicely and offers the feel of a fully integrated village society.   Beyond that, several of the characters were formulaic, which is the films biggest problem.  Another 25 - 30 minutes would have added moretime for the characters to be played as deeper and with more interest.  Of particular note, are the ethereal and simultaneously stark scenes which are the flashbacks of a young Ichabod Craine.  These offer further hint to the visual masterwork of Tim Burton.

I'm very sure Tim Burton fans will like this, but this movie will seriously make me reconsider ever paying to see a Tim Burton work again.The only thing which saved the movie a little maybe was Christopher Walken as the deranged face and Ray Park (Darth Maul) as the deranged stunt body of the villain. Even then Burton managed to film the action sequences with such little originality and such a heavy hand on the 'dark is cooool maaan!' lever on his camera that the action was forgettable at best.So what do we have? Forgettable action padding miserable plot, all wrapped up in misty 'dark is coool maan' shades.Horrible.",Sleepy Hollow
425,irishgirl,Just be glad you're not a chicken,10,6 June 2000,"That was the best movie I've seen in a long time.  I loved it.  For Christmas I received the book sleepy hollow that was written from the movie and then the real story by Washington Irving afterwards.  It was so good because it made you want to read it all the time until the end and I finished the book in 3 days. (not constantly reading of course, I'm not that slow of a reader)  It described the gory details so vividly that I thought the movie was going to be really gross and disgusting with blood.  And then I found out it was.  Well, not really.  My imagination made the book good. But I absolutely fell in love with the movie.  I think everyone loved Johnny Depp's portrayal of Icabod Crane.  I know I did. (tee hee)  His acting was so good because of his facial expressions and the fact that Icabod is so timid and meek that he faints every time something graphic happens.  And hats off to Mr. Burton.  He rocks at making scary movies.  My favorite is The Nightmare Before Christmas.  Keep on rollin'.",Sleepy Hollow

The acting is excellent by Christina Ricci and Johnny Depp (who I must say, looks sooo hot in this movie), both are fit for their parts perfectly. This is the kind of movie you want to rent while having a sleepover, or on holloween. The ending may surprise you, and some parts may be just plain gross (cough, cough, the church, cough, cough), but you will never be bored watching. There is always a surprise around the corner you might not expect. Things pop out at you in this movie, and that is great to have. Tim Burton has showed his best work yet! Its an excellent film, and my favorite movie of all time, with some of my favorite actors. SEE IT TODAY!My rating for this movie: 10/10!! Its great!",Sleepy Hollow

Guys might actually like this movie,(compared to most of the other reviews I have written so far =P) what with all the spears going through people and heads getting chopped off. The movie had some (in my opinion) unnecessary parts, and while it may be in the book, I would have to use the example of Crane having flashbacks of his mother, and where he got the scars on his hand, as an example of an unnecessary part. The whole bit about the symbol under Crane's bed, and what it really was about, was quite predictable.The movie kept me guessing/trying to figure out what the heck was going on, almost to the very end, and overall is a suspense/action/somewhat-horror-though not really all that scary- movie that is worth the time it takes to watch it.",Sleepy Hollow

431,jakeandelwood,Not Horror but a Gothic Fairy Tale,8,19 June 2001,"Perhaps you have to be a Burton fan to like this stuff. The scenery, the characters, the humor; it is all Burton. I loved this one. The atmosphere that it is breathing, the lack of color, the darkness and the surrounding. It all contributes to the big picture. A dark mysterious tale of an insecure policeman and the tale of a legendary ghost: The Headless Horseman.Johnny Depp plays his part superbly. He is Ichabod Crane, the sometimes clumsy scientific N.Y. policeman. I even thought Ricci was terrific. By holding back her emotions and even act a little ""cold"" you could understand why Crane in the end has his doubts about her. But the greatest pleasure I took out of the part of the Horseman himself. Christopher Walken (the man who once said:'There is no such thing as a small role, only small actors') proofs that with just a few movie-minutes you can steel an entire picture. He is one scary horseman!I read that some people didn't like the combination of humor, horror and what more. I think it makes it a better picture. Other people felt this wasn't a good horror movie. Well they are right because it is not. I like to think of it as a gothic fairy tale. If you want to compare it to horror, I think it will remind people to the seventies hammer horror. This, for example, also was a studio film.Well I didn't read the story of the legend of Sleepy Hollow, but I can imagine that, for his own convenience, Burton did not stick to the original. And for this picture it may have been better so. I mean if Tim Burton has an idea about something you should let him go his own way and something beautiful will come out of it, just like this one.The Art Direction on this picture was great and therefore deserved the Oscar (Although I still think that during the last couple of years the Academy Award is the less serious film-award of them all). This was the third Burton/Depp movie, Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands were the other two, but I wouldn't mind if they made a fourth, fifth or even sixth movie together. If the outcome would be as great as this one (or the other two)it would certainly be a reason to visit the cinema again. Therefore this one got the highest score from me. A solid 10 out of 10",Sleepy Hollow
432,Flower_of_the_Lily,80 % Wonderful ...,8,4 February 2006,"Released well before Johnny Depp's star exploded in the form of Captain Jack Sparrow, this is nonetheless a well-crafted, superbly entertaining piece of film. Set in a spooky, beautiful Gothic fairy-land, the plot follows 18th Century New York detective Ichabod Crane (a man whose beliefs are rooted firmly in science) attempting to solve a very supernatural mystery in the small village of Sleepy Hollow. Surrounded by local conspirators and aided by a fearless local girl, Katrina Van Tassel, and a plucky servant boy (known to all as young Masbeth) Ichabod sets himself against the town, its elders, and an utterly terrifying foe in the form of a headless (and very dead) horseman.Depp's rising star is much in evidence as he portrays the bright, well-meaning, eccentric, scared witless but ultimately heroic Crane, with only slightly more restraint than he's brought to the likes of Willy Wonka or Edward Scissorhands. A variety of good actors and actress flesh out neatly sketched supporting characters, and there's a truly ace mystery to be solved within the film. The set pieces are stunning, the action fantastic (though very very gory) - so why the 80% rating? Plot and dialogue, sadly. The 18th century speech is often cardboard in its stiffness, and only Depp manages to liven it up. And as aforementioned, despite the excellently plotted mystery, the storyline is cluttered up with a complex (but totally unnecessary) back-story for Crane that rather detracts rather than adds to the essence of the film's major goings-on.These criticisms aside however, this is a great film and a fine way to distract yourself on a dark evening ... leaving the light on, of course.",Sleepy Hollow
433,hartig,I liked Disney's version better,8,27 November 1999,"I'm a fan of Tim Burton's.  I really enjoyed his work in ""Ed Wood"" (a very underrated film) ""Edward Scissorhands"" and most of his others.  While I liked this film, I don't think it was his best work.The same goes for Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, whom I feel to be two of the most talented actors in film today.  (Note:  Ricci has really become a very beautiful woman).The gore was a little thick in this movie and the strays from the original masterpiece work of Irving were too many.  The volume in the theatre was also a little loud for me (but that's not Burton's fault).I did get a number of chuckles, though.  If you watch this film, go into it expecting to laugh more than anything.  It is a very wicked black comedy.But I'd take the animated Disney masterpiece over this one if you're interested in seeing a good retelling of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.""",Sleepy Hollow
434,dbgeorge,Way too gory...,1,27 November 2005,"I am a huge fan of Tim Burton's films, but this film for me is almost unwatchable. The decapitations are very graphic. This movie looks more like a cheap slasher movie than a high-budget horror/fantasy film. Some of the gory scenes are even meant to be comical, which I did not find one bit funny.The look of the film is very cool. It has a very nightmarish look. I think Christopher Walken is miscast as the Hessian Horseman. The part does not require any acting, and he has no lines. He does look very scary with the pointed teeth and wind-blown hair. I am also getting pretty tired of Johnny Depp portraying bumbling simpletons, even thought his character is suppose to be a skilled detective. There are no other roles that are memorable.I knew the basic story of the headless horseman before seeing this movie, but I thought this was a poor adaptation.",Sleepy Hollow
435,Brooklyn-10,Good fun,8,24 November 1999,"Sorry to see this movie is being picked on so much already. Maybe some people forget you go see Tim Burton's movies to have FUN, already! This is a beautifully stylish movie, I could not get enough of seeing that hellish figure flying on the back of his demon-horse, cloak flying and sword flailing. Fantastic! The town itself was a wonderful presence, with old covered bridges and wicked looking trees. Johnny Depp was of course fabulous, he looked as if he genuinely enjoyed himself while making this movie. A shame for an actor of such range to be so underappreciated. He seems to suffer from the ""Ralph Fiennes Syndrome"", where actors with tremendous talent are snubbed because they are simply too good looking. (They got the face, so they must not need the award, or some odd reasoning. Perhaps it's envy...?) ""Sleepy Hollow"" is not scary, but then very few horror films truly are. It is more like a horror-themed ride at an amusement park, a very expensive amusement park. There are some laughs, not big ones but chuckles, and a sense of good-humor throughout. If I had to choose a weak point it would be Christina Ricci, which pains me because I loved her in the ""Addams Family"" movies, but here she sleepwalks through her role, many of her lines of dialogue sounding much flat, as if she were reciting them for a boring grade-school report. But it did not matter enough to me to affect my overall opinion of ""Sleepy Hollow"", which is that it was good fun. And Christopher Walken as the Hessian- of course!",Sleepy Hollow

437,RLove,Ugh,2,15 August 2002,"I recognize that I'm definitely in the minority here, but I thought this movie was terrible.  It's pretty rare that I shut a movie off, but I didn't think that this one was worth my time.To me, the movie's pace seemed to be at cross purposes with its subject. There seemed to be more frolicking than terror.  It just rapidly leaped from sequence to sequence, maintaining a very light-hearted feel the entire time. There was far too much romping for me to feel any suspense, and the only horror that the story was capable of producing came from its God-awful quality.***SKIP NEXT PARAGRAPH TO AVOID SPOILERS***  Let's see here...there's an investigator whose new methods are contrary to his superiors.  He's a person that has lots of fun little gadgets of his own design.  His mother died because she was wrongly accused.  Is there anything even remotely resembling originality here?  Not even Depp could rescue this cardboard character.  And I will grant that there was an original treatment of the actual legend by going with crime investigation, but this was also terrible.  The investigation seemed to move forward by very, very thin strands of logic that struck me as ridiculous.  Finally, this movie has a love story even worse than the one in Pearl Harbor.  Depp and Ricci meet, and by the third scene together they are in love for no apparent reason.I'm not particularly familiar with Tim Burton, but between this and the disgusting remake of Planet of the Apes, I don't think I want to.  The story is ludicrous, the characters shallow pieces of trash, and the mood right out of a Ren and Stimpy cartoon.  I have nothing against Ren and Stimpy, but that's because they weren't trying to be scary.This one was too busy trying to be hip to be any good. 2/10",Sleepy Hollow
438,glennspillman,A great story with a nice twist.,10,3 October 2016,"I have watched all of Tim Burton's films, and this one did not disappoint. Burton lives in an obscure world of his own and you can see that in his work. Not only in the typed of movies that he does, but also in the style of the sets. Sleepy Hallow is an age old tale, but Burton puts his own flavor in the way the film is made. Even though Christopher Doesn't really have any lines in the film, other that a hush and a few screams, he put on a nice and eerie performance. Crane was in town investigating these mysterious murders, but there was a more underlying sinister backstory. This is where the twist comes in. In this movie, you as the viewer are trying to pin point what is really going on, but, things aren't always what they seen. I suggest that you pay close attention to the plot and to each character. In my reviews I try to never give out to much information about the movie, because I hate spoilers. Sleepy Hallow is a movie that you can watch over and over again, and with each viewing you will learn something new.",Sleepy Hollow
439,VerbalKint-2,"Beautifully directed and filmed, but it is slightly flawed",8,21 November 1999,"Being a Tim Burton fan, and having known for a couple years that Burton would be directing this film,  I was excited by the trailers which started popping up in cinemas months ago.  I waited for Thanksgiving (which came and went the second week of October), and then I realized that I had to wait for AMERICAN Thanksgiving.  Which I was barely able to do, by the way.  After all, it's been more than 3 years since Mars Attacks!, Burton's last directorial effort.Well, I must admit:  Sleepy Hollow is worth the wait.  From the moment the film started until the end credits rolled I was in absolute awe of the visual splendor presented in the movie.  Even the gory scenes (and there are plenty) were visually stunning.  I found my jaw was frequently dangling near the base of my neck, and many of the shots had me drooling.The acting, also, is top drawer.  I rather liked Depp's take on Ichabod Crane.  He seems, at times, almost inept as a police Constable (almost like he should have been a teacher instead).  Christina Ricci plays a good girl very well, totally hiding the bad-girl image I've had of her since The Addams Family.  Miranda Richardson also puts in a good turn, though she's a bit under-used.The story is excellent, though it sometimes plays like a Hammer Studios film, the effects are - for the most part - unobtrusive, and Danny Elfman's score is as stirring as anything he's ever written.As for the flaws...well, the ending seemed to me rather abrupt, although right now I can't think of an alternative. I was also able to spot a couple of continuity errors, and to spot them on the first viewing is a testament to their obviousness.8.5/10 - For the beautifully haunting images, good pacing and acting, and that unmistakable Tim Burton weirdness.",Sleepy Hollow
440,Chris-361,Not bad at all...,8,19 November 1999,"With the credit ""Directed by Tim Burton"" on the film, its easy for it to get much hype. I myself bought into the hype, and to say that I wasn't a little disappointed would be a lie.But nevertheless, this was by no means a bad movie. I was, in fact, everything it was meant to be: FUN. And fun it was.From the very beginning to the very end, you will witness heads spinning, rolling, and flying through the air with the whif of the horseman's sword. Tim Burton definately has fun with this, and really does a good job of turning it into some pretty horrific scenes.The film also had great cinematography, incredible set design, an amazing musical score, and...oh yeah...some pretty freakin' cool special effects. The acting was so so, as Johnny Depp doesn't really know how to make his character a hero, Christina Ricci was good, and so was everyone else. That also includes Christopher Walken, who plays the horseman with a head. He has no lines but just by looking at him he really puts the fear of god in your heart.So Tim Burton does it again. His goriest, weirdest, goriest, action-filled, goriest, scariest, and goriest movie to date. Did I mention that it was pretty gory? Oh, well, that's okay. If you're not of the faint of heart.

442,bldsimple2,The One Thing The Horseman DIDN'T Cut--The Plot,8,20 November 1999,"Having observed the best and worst stories of the past year I can only state, in my humble opinion, that this time Hollywood went too far.When Hollywood has a story that involves random violence and punishment of sinners in general, the first question the suits ask is, how can we make this ""relate"" to the audiences in general?  In other words, they try to second guess you, me, your idiotic friend sitting next to you, and the audience as a whole.WHO CARES???????  The Headless Horseman is a classic.  He can explode from the shadows, chase down a sinner and lop off his head with all the incredible digital effects at his disposal for THREE HOURS of screen time, it doesn't make a difference.  Just make sure that Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp, the hero) finds a way to dispatch him and save the day.Hollywood, however, has presented the Headless Horseman as a poseur.  Rather than making him a servant of hell that appears in the mist, a sharpened blade ready to sever the head of his victim, he is now the servant of.....wait, I guess that would be giving it away.But once again, I say, WHO CARES??????  Let the Horseman ride free.  Let Ichabod Crane detect his existence.  Let Miss Van Tassle (Christina Ricci, unbelievably blonde) work her charms.  And let the townspeople quiver in fear, not because they all know they are part of some conspiracy, but because he who is without sin shall retain his (or her) head.But allow me to marvel at this film's incredible visionary process.  Tim Burton (who I do not fault one iota) has given us his darkest vision yet. The sets are immaculate, the photography is wonderfully washed out (near black and white), and the pacing is heart-stopping.  This being is umpteeth pairing with Johnny Depp gives us a sort of backwards Stanly Kramer/Spencer Tracy quality (or Capra/Stewart, you decide).Depp has said in a few interviews that key to his performance was to play Ichabod like a 13 year old girl.  Knowing this going in only makes some of the funniest scenes in the movie even more so...and did I mention the humor? Tom Stoppard (Shakespeare In Love) apparently did a stem to stern re-write of the script (credited to Se7en's Andrew Kevin Walker).  It helped, I think, in the comedic aspects, but whoever's idea it was to introduce the ""conspiracy theory"" (and a nowhere flashback to Crane's childhood) to this film should have had the Horseman loosed on him.One last praise: digital effects.  I can not relate to you here why I loved them.  I can only tell you that I was shocked.  Amazed. Horrified. ...and I loved it.",Sleepy Hollow
443,Lord_Fug,"Dark, Comic, Evil, Tense, Tim Burton...",8,4 January 2000,"I just saw Sleepy Hollow in an advanced Preview show in the UK.  I went with a couple of mates, all of whom had seen some Tim Burton before but only I was a big fan.  I simply love Tim Burton's surreal style of directing and of all the films I've seen of his (Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands, Ed Wood, Mars Attacks!, etc.) I thought only Mars Attacks! Was less than superb.  ESH for example has a superbly innocent atmosphere to it but it extremely dark at times.  So now, with the release of a new Tim Burton film (of a story I remember fondly from the old Disney Cartoon of the 50's) I was rather excited to see it!  And so, I sat in the darkened cinema at my local Multiplex and was amazed.  From the dark and mysterious opening to the more humour-spiked yet no less horrific end this is one of my favourite films ever!  I'm a big horror film fan and was so looking forward to seeing what take Tim Burton would have a true horror film.  My god, he did well.  The look of the piece is both extremely dark and evil (the Horseman kills men, women and children with equal relish) but it retains scenes of beautiful, dreamlike states once again making good use of Mr. Burton's own thoughts and visions.  It's a very funny film too.  Depp is great as an Englishman (only slipping into American twang in one syllable early on in the movie) who will battle the horseman and inspect headless, beetle filled corpses with gusto but then leap onto a chair, screaming when he sees a spider!  Christina Ricci was also very good.  Usually, her parts are beautiful yet rather evil characters that look innocent and pure until you look into her eyesnot this time though.  She just looks, well, sweet! She's softly spoken, and very caring and that's it, no daggers in the pupils, no sly frowns to the camera.  Christopher Walken made the small role he had in the headless horseman (he played him on the few occasions he actually had a head) his own with his usual evil visage and a load of screaming!  Plus nastily shaved down teeth.  The real masterstroke of this film though, or at least its main bad guy is the use of Ray Park.  For those of you who saw Episode One and enjoyed the lightsabre battle at the end, Ray Park was Darth Maul!  He brings a very modern look to the fighting, most scenes are fought with a sword in one hand and an axe in the other! Its like a medieval John Woo!  But almost every time that he gets hold of a weapon he does some kind of stylish one-handed flip to the sound of wonderfully over-the-top swish sounds!  The deaths, most of which decapitations of course, are all seen onscreen in their full, gory glory.  Not a single piece of blood escapes the cameras here!  The film really does have a lot of blood in it but it's a kind of comic book redder than red blood, which adds to the whole films not quite real feel.  The cinematography is once again, from Burton, superb.  The vile smog0filled 18th century New York and the Scarecrow at the beginning.  My god, the scarecrow, its so evil!  Onscreen for a second but its image lasts But anyway, in short, this is a fantastic film.  Burton has never done anything this visually eye-popping before (take a bow Industrial Light & Magic).  The plot is both intriguing and whimsical, the acting excellent, it has a cameo from Hammer Horror master Christopher Lee and it boasts one of the most evil, most frightening, most superbly realized supernatural baddies I've ever seenand I've seen plenty! Go see this film if you like horror or you just want some fast-paced fun 9 out of 10",Sleepy Hollow

It wasn't necessarily gory but it had lots of decapitation. The script was ok and the soundtrack was kind of interesting.

Whats special about depp's character is that he displays bravery and at the same time succumbs to fear . This results in classic gallows humor . The locations are classy .

447,bondfan27,A stunning masterpiece to an American classic!,10,10 September 2003,"One of the most influential films of all time to me is Tim Burton's stylish, stunning masterpiece ""Sleepy Hollow"", a truly deserving film to an American classic tale. Tim Burton uses such amazing touches of dark lore and gothic to create a film so wrapped up in storyline and ideas, it will bring you back for a seconed time...and a third time, maybe, even a forth time (For me it made me buy the video and then later the DVD as well). I was so influenced by the film that I took a vacation to the real Sleepy Hollow, New York during the autumn season. But anyway back to the film. This film, based upon the old Washington Irving tale is done up to a 21st century realism, complete with a stylish story so puzzling yet so astonishing, I still cannot completely understand (Don't get me wrong, the films plot has many surfaces, you'll understand the first layer naturally but look closer a few more times and more will be revealed, *that's a true technique to a classic). Having worked with Tim Burton before with ""Ed Wood"", Johnny Depp is reunited again with Burton to play the role of Icabod Crane, not a simple school-teacher like in the ol' folk tale, but now a New York City investegator sent to the county of Sleepy Hollow in order to investigate the mysterious murders of a supposed ""Headless Horsemen"" (The horsemen without his head was played by Ray Park (Known by millions as Darth Maul of Star Wars: Episode I). Christina Ricci plays the mysterious Katrina Van Tassel, who plays mixed emotions with magic and love to Icabod's head. The supporting cast goes on and on, and I will say that Burton is a master at casting people. I see no one at all as talented as Depp to play Icabod. Christina? Well...she could possibly replaced, but she knows what she's doing since she has a background for dark films (""Casper"" and ""The Adams' Family"" are both in relation to horror even though their family related films). I tried to sum it as best as I could, but basiclly, I wrote this review in 2003, and to this day have not seen a film that matches it in style (The closet film to match it is 2001's ""From Hell"" starring...Johnny Depp!). So, simple reviews: Burton's best, Depp's best, Ricii's Better, A True American Classic, An Essential for any film fan. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a big favor and run (Don't walk) to your local video store to see it!Fun facts: -Ray Park plays the horsemen, but people know him better as Darth Maul (SW:Ep. 1) -The film was shot oddly, not in Sleepy Hollow, but in England. -The town was built from the ground up. -The Western Woods was completely built on a sound stage. -Martin Landau (Who played Bela Lugosi in ""Ed Wood"") makes a brief biref appearence then sadly dies (Try and guess how). -Not that it matters but Depp played a similar character to Icabod in 2001's ""From Hell"" which was about the Jack the Ripper story in which he played the investegator of the crimes (His character was like Icabod in 100 years from Sleepy Hollow (Sleepy Hollow takes place in 1799, From Hell is like 1910's, or maybe 1890's...I forget) and also heavily into drugs. *It's like the twisted evil side of Icabod)",Sleepy Hollow

The long-winded exposition scenes are an embarrassment, and people have already commented on the plot flaws, the lack of chemistry between Depp and Ricci, and the incredible mangling of the original Irving story.  But wait, there's more!Christopher Walken looks and acts comical as the horseman.  His recurring line is ""rahhr!""  Far from being scary, he looks like a clown, and I kept expecting him to launch into a story about a gold watch.  (Oh, and how could anyone fail to notice the headless horseman visibly looking around for his horse when he comes out of the windmill?)Crane is a confused character - one minute the bold constable questioning everyone, the next minute shaking violently with fear when they tell him the ghost story.  In one scene he pushes a boy in front of him into a cave, and in the next he insists on going first.  This isn't a complex character; it's a badly-written one.The script is awful.  ""You must have some witch in you."" ""Why?"" ""Because you have bewitched me.""  Argh!  But the scene that really pushed it over the edge into B-movie territory came at the end.  I'll refrain from Ebert-style spoilers (that man should be restrained!), but why did Crane and Katrina choose -that particular moment-, you know which one I'm talking about, to start hugging and kissing at the climax of the movie?  That moment was about as romantic as a prison rape, and their reaction was *completely* inappropriate.  Much of the audience burst out laughing, which I'm sure wasn't Burton's intent.Go in with your expectations set for ""bad"", and you might be able to stomach it.",Sleepy Hollow
451,AlWhite,Good but not great.,7,21 November 1999,"A beautiful film, but the script could have been better.Tim fills the screen with what we expect from him - lush shots and great atmosphere.  I loved the look of the movie, and up until the plot started to unravel it's well above average.Unfortunately the shot in the previews of the witch lurching towards the screen foreshadows some of the negative elements which crept into this film and spoiled a lot of the atmosphere in the end.",Sleepy Hollow
452,WoBiE1,Visual story telling at its finest,9,21 November 1999,I love Tim Burton.  I really do.  Tim Burton has created an utterly fascinating world of images that are beyond compare.  Truly original designs of 18th century cottages and smoke walkways are prevalent throughout the entire film.  Acting was inspired as well; I haven't seen Depp perform this well since Burton's own Edward Scissorhands.  Christina Ricci gives a fine performance but is lacking somewhat an emotional depth. The bottom line is that the visuals are the real stars of the show.  They give a sense of escapism I haven't felt in many movies.  The headless horseman is shown with immense style without overly exposing his true form.  A foreboding sense of horror is always a primary goal.  A must see for all.,Sleepy Hollow
453,Micu,A wisecrack unnoticed by my Parisian audience,10,12 February 2000,"I enjoyed this last Burton very much (for me, it's his best). Although the action is scaring all along, some breaks are provided for the soft-hearted, such as: ""Do you think he's dead?"" ""The problem, is that he was already dead!"" But my biggest laugh was at the end, when Depp tells Ricci: ""This is New York, and you'll get accustomed to it very quickly: the Bronx is up and the Battery's down"" (an hommage to Betty Comden-Adolph Green-Leonard Bernstein's ON THE TOWN). I even expected a final title : AND PEOPLE WEREN'T YET TRAVELING UNDERGROUND.Of course,I was the only to push a big laugh in the Parisian afternoon audience... henry caraso",Sleepy Hollow
454,samarand,Wow!,10,16 March 2000,"I suppose any comment from me will be suspect, because I usually like Tim Burton's movies (even Mars Attacks!, 'nuff said!). I went to see this movie because it was by Burton: I like Washington Irving's stories in general, but I always considered Sleepy Hollow as a rather stupid story. Just in case you loved the movie and wish to check out the book, I say, well, don't. If I remember correctly in the story Ichabod Crane is a highly irritating schoolmaster, Katrina is a stolid but good-looking future Hausfrau, and Brom is just like in the movie, only it's he who gets the girl in the end. The screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (he of Se7en), very intelligently turns the story into a fairy-talish comic-horror whodunit, Ichabod into an all-questioning detective whose superiors can't wait to get rid of, and Katrina into a smart witch apprentice. Johnny Depp plays his Ichabod with comic zest, Christina Ricci proves once again to be a quite talented young lady, and the rest of the cast is also excellent, including a stunning Christopher Walken as the Hessian Horseman (in an uncredited appearance, I believe), and  Christopher Lee and Martin Landau also shine in small parts. The Gothic-Old Flemish atmosphere is superb. This is quite the movie for you if you like your movies to be unusual and unpredictable.",Sleepy Hollow

I went to the movie hoping to see Johnny Depp in a role more along the lines of Edward Scissorhands. I was thoroughly disappointed. His character was cartoon like (though this was not his fault).Except for the really beautiful images, there was nothing about this movie. Those were really stunning and helped created the mood... unfortunately the mood was entirely spoiled by the horror scenes, which were ludicrous.As I have said before and I repeat, everything else is just cartoons. The directing, the acting, everything. I suppose I should have expected this... serves me well not to go see another Tim Burton movie. Anyway, if you like his style, you will probably enjoy it...(Spoilers...)In one of the scenes at the end of the movie, which I suppose was meant to be the most frightening one, where the Rider gets his head back, I could not refrain from laughing!! I didn't laugh as much at a supposedly serious movie since Predator...",Sleepy Hollow
457,ekwillow,Best Tim Burton Film Yet!,8,10 June 2000,"Now I'm a big Tim Burton fan and before I rented this I just knew it would be a good movie because in my opinion Tim Burton hasn't made a bad movie yet.  Yes, I even liked Mars Attacks!  And Tim's streak is still alive in this awesome movie with great perfromances by Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci (who for once is not playing a slut) Now I will admit that Tim Burton has a weird mind but a good one and he shows it all in this movie.  Everything was great about this film.  The acting, the story, the direction by Burton, the music, and the special effects.  There's also a little bit of darkish comedy.  Very like Tim Burton.  And the violence in it is pretty bloody so watch for that too.

460,DanPacino,"Good cast, good movie.",10,19 October 2001,"Sleepy Hollow is without a doubt Tim Burtons best film. He sure as hell ruined the Batman movies but we could almost forgive him for this little gem. Luckily this time Burton 'heads' out with the great old story of the Headless Horse man, a better than average script and, what I believe to be the winning factor, a fantastic cast. Johnny Depp was perfect for the role of Constable Craine and Ms Ricci was above par in her role as the sordid love interest. But forget them. What made this movie great was the fantastic supporting cast. Everywhere I looked I saw the familiar faces of some of my most loved actors:- Jeffrey Jones (Ravenous),Michael Gough (Alfred from Batman), Christopher Lee (Dracula},Miranda Richardson (Blackadder), Christopher Walken (Waynes World 2)and the great Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine from the Star Wars series). It was the characters of these 'supporting actors' who made this film as good as it was (especially Walken and McDiarmid). All in all it was a great film with a great story and a great cast I'd give it 9.5 out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow
461,algjgg,An instant horror classic that never lets up,10,24 September 2007,"Let's put this in simple terms: Sleepy Hollow is pure Tim Burton at it's finest. The story revolves around the legendary Headless Horseman aka the Hessian, a merciless bounty hunter turned headless demonic psycho as he haunts a tiny town called Sleepy Hollow. It's up to Ichabod Crane and a few others to solve the mystery of him before he goes genocide on the whole town.The characters are very well conceived, the acting is amazing, and the story has some very interesting twists that were made Tim Burton style.There aren't many movies out there that compare to Sleepy Hollow and only Tim Burton can make it this damn good.

463,riotrr,Great take on an old story,8,3 August 2004,"This movie Sleepy Hollow is an interesting take on the old horror story The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow. The effects and sets are great. I love that dark sky brooding look of this film. Johnny Depp is wonderful as a complex Icabod Crane. At times he's brave and precise and at other times he's easily terrified and still at other times he's down right funny. The film itself mirrors Depp's character. The movie is scary at times and then it turns funny. It always stays in good taste though. It is a delicate balancing act that works perfectly!  While this movie is first a horror film, it is also a bit of a mystery film too. I found myself, like Depp's character, trying to ""discover"" the perpetrator of the crimes. I also found myself trying to figure out the reason for the ghastly crimes. All in all Sleepy Hollow is very good. Maybe not classic material for me but, very good. I recommend it highly!!    8 out of 10",Sleepy Hollow
464,Gio-11,"Pretentious, expensive twaddle",3,2 January 2000,"The horror genre relies on atmosphere and a certain amount of shock.  Sadly, many directors rely on gore to get their popcorn guzzling audience to sit through their work.  Tim Burton is an interesting director but he relies also on visual excess to cover up that his films often lack a plot. Sleepy Hollow is as its title suggests - a yawn.  Granted, the production design is spectacular, a delight to the eye, there is cleavage to delight the soul and lots of British thespians to delight the brain, but there is little else.  I was not chilled or thrilled by this pretentious, expensive twaddle.  Loosely based on the Washington Irving story ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", the film is badly miscast with Johnny Depp in the role of Ichabod Crane (one wonders what Jeff Goldblum - closer to Irving's idea of Crane - would have done with the role).  Depp puts on some sort of accent while everone around him is touring the British Isles with theirs and Miranda Richardson has an inexplicably American twang which disappears from time to time.  Christina Ricci is wasted - she does not even get good frocks, only a billowing cape, the frocks are left to Miranda Richardson who gets several costume changes, some mad-woman histrionics and a bit of rumpy in the forest (why - don't ask).  Burton and his plotters play around with the original story and add some modern bits because hip, hop and happening audiences like their costume dramas with current references so they do not get lost.  An uncredited Martin Landau gets his noggin lopped off at the start and then it's on, for young and old - axes fly, heads roll, Miranda glares, push up bras strain, Danny Elfman's score goes over the top, the British thesps think of the money they're making, swallow their pride and the whole thing ends with a blatant rip-off from ""The Moonspinners"" and ""Terminator"".  This movie goes on and on and on - I can tell you there are few words you can make from the letters in the Exit sign.  I cannot spoil the plot for you because there isn't one and the revelation about the Van Tassells cheating the Van Dammes because of the Van Halens by stealing from the Van Goghs is so convoluted and uninteresting that I concentrated on the cleavage.  Incidentally, there is some sub-plot about Ichabod Crane's mum floating in a forest (dream sequence) which is a hoot - primarily because the actor playing Depp as a child is the weirdest looking kid (think Uncle Fester's love child with Monica Lewinsky) and an obscure symbol involving a red cardinal (bird).  My bottom went numb watching this and the entire cast and crew should be spanked for their crimes against intelligence.",Sleepy Hollow
465,Movie Steve,"A Visually Well-Done Film, With Minor Flaws",8,21 June 2000,"Sleepy Hollow is a visually well-produced film, with an interesting plot, and good-enough acting that leaves us with memorable characters.Burton's visuals are, as usual, very good. Visuals of snow reminded me of the snow in Edward Scissorhands, and the warped landscape reminded me very much of the sets in Beetlejuice. His attention to detail, while not perfect (the ""millennium"" did not arrive in 1800, as Crane expects) was still impressive. The wig hairstyles looked authentic to the time - especially the one on Ferris Bueller's principal's head! - and the Dutch architecture in Sleepy Hollow is appropriate for a Dutch-settled state. The costumes looked elaborate and well-done.However, the strongly anti-religious tone was a turn off, and inaccurate, since the Puritan manner and doctrine of the town's religious leaders reflect a 1699 view of life, rather than that of 1799. Given how religion is handled, though, the open practice of witchcraft by nearly all of the town's womenfolk is simply not believable, and reeks of P.C..Otherwise, the plot, though certainly not what Washington Irving wrote, was exciting and a clever interpretation. The dialogue in the beginning scenes of his dealings with the legal system in NYC was poorly written and overly preachy, but did set up Ichabod's visit to Sleepy Hollow.Depp's acting was very stilted, but that's just what the character requires, and his formal manner was right for the time period of the film. He even brings some humor to the character that I really enjoyed.The film was not very gory, but did shock me a couple of times, which was good, for this type of film! I would recommend this film to anyone who likes Burton's style of film.",Sleepy Hollow
466,Gygax_Jr,"Great atmosphere, great movie.",8,22 November 2002,"Sleepy Hollow is one of Tim Burtons best films. The films great story line is accompanied well with a classy lead role performance by the great Johnny Depp (one of his best roles I believe) and he is surrounded by a stella suporting cast of some of my favourite thespiens such as Christina Ricci, Christopher Lee, Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid, Jeffrey Jones, Miranda Richardson and Michael Gambon. This film is a good example of how, if minor characters are played well, the movie gains a great sense of atmosphere. Adding to the atmosphere established by the characters is some inspired set designs, which have Tim Burton written all over them, and a roaring score by the great Danny Elfman. Of course, atmosphere alone does not make a great movie, but in Sleepy Hollow's case, it goes a long way to helping its appeal.8 out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow

Periodically, as a Johnny Depp fan, I watch it, on and off season.  Each time I watch, I see something new and entertaining.  Though bloody in content, I have been fascinated by the story, the characters and the cinematography.  I loved the performance of all actors, each character being unique and no matter the size of the part a great addition to the story.  Costuming, terrific period pieces that lent great highlight to the story.  The backdrop for the story and the music both amazing, lending all that was necessary to make the story suspenseful.  Fight scenes were many, varied and exciting and special effects were exactly that, special effects. I recommend this movie highly, with one last comment, it is gory and there is one sexual scene that is very sexual.  No nudity but sexual. An amazing piece of movie making, I give it a 10 as I have watched it enough to determine it deserves that rating.",Sleepy Hollow
468,kinoman-2,For the 90s audience,4,26 November 1999,"Washington Irving's story could have been a perfect vehicle for Burton's talents. However, Irving's atmospheric classic was updated into a serial killer movie which is very 90s-like: loud, over-the-top and weak on characterization and plot. At first, it looks gorgeous but as the story gets increasingly thin and predictable, the movie's gorgeous look can't save it. By the end the movie reminds something like The Terminator rather than a gothic story as it should be.",Sleepy Hollow

I lost track of the number of heads, but it probably reached 20 by the end of the picture.Johny Depp was excellent, and the supporting cast was believable.The period was represented well in the film as the year 1799 seemed to come to life in Tim Burton's dark vision of greys, mud, and smoke.I rated this a 8 out of 10, its a good movie but not the greatest movie of all time.

The story of a New York inspectors creepy encounter with unknown forces is superbly portrayed by Johnny Depp. As in many of his films, Depp is usually overlooked and only remembered for his recent Jack Sparrow performances. Here though he is at his best mixing serious horror with slightly humorous characteristics.The film deals with a rather outlandish theme, but Depp is there to see it does not go straight over the audiences head. The headless horseman is a typical symbol in Gothic horror stories, but here it is Johnny Depp that brings it to life. Of course the other actors all deserve similar praise and as a collective help make Sleepy Hollow an excellent couple of hours viewing.",Sleepy Hollow

Whoever thinks this is a horror is clearly missing something and has not seen any bona fide horror movies such as The Exorcist, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, The Night of the Living Dead or Psycho.  I thought the film was stupid, but decent performances from Christina Ricci, Richard Griffiths and Christopher Lee give it some credence.

The setting is perfect as a gloomy, foggy kind of town in 1799. The whole movie reminds me of ""From Hell"" which also has Johnny Depp in it only this isn't as freaky. They both are but you can't compare the two except for the violence and the settings because they aren't very different.Without a doubt, it is still up there as one of my favorite Tim Burton movies.

479,Matt-33,A big dissapointment,7,21 November 1999,"Even though I enjoyed seeing Sleepy Hollow, and probably will buy it when it comes out for sale, I would have to say that it is Tim Burton's most disappointing film.  The cinematography was excellent, the action scenes were spectacular, but the story itself seemed kind of half-assed.  The main problem I had was Ichabod's dreams.  They had no relavence to the rest of the movie. They seemed like they could done a lot more with them, for example:  Have his mother be the witch controlling the horseman.  But no, his mom was a witch and his dad killed her.  That's just great. 
The next problem was ""the villan"" :  Where the hell did she come from?  She just popped in at the end of the movie!  I mean i know that we saw her as a child, and I knew she was Katrina's stepmom, but that's it!  The she just pops in and basically says ""In cased you missed it, here's the plot""  The plot of a movie should be hinted at throughout the film, not just thrown at the end.

481,bjones-2,Wonderful rendition of an Old Story,10,22 November 1999,"I am not a fan or ""horror"" movies and seeing this movie was a relief to me because it isn't one. It is much more. This is a brilliantly done retelling of an old tale, masterfully told and beautifully presented.The original Washington Irving story is still there but with some new twists. For example, Ichabod Crane, played by Johnny Depp, was a schoolmaster in the original and he's a detective here, but it works.Christopher Walken is appropriately menacing as the Hessian Cavalryman who becomes the horseman and Richardson is tinged with just enough evil to be interesting. Christina Ricci is fetching and mysterious as a young lady interested in Crane. Her portrayal is as outstanding as she is beautiful. The remainder of the characters are excellently cast. The casts performances are tight and true to the story throughout. Casper Van Dien as Brom Van Brunt is surprisingly good as well. Van Dien has a fight scene with the horseman and Crane (Depp) that is a striking and outstanding example of action and how it should be executed for maximum effect. I have to say here that I went into the theater expecting to be disappointed with the special effects after seeing the trailers. I was wrong. This film came alive in this telling and the effects were flawless.My favorite aspect of the film, however, was the sets, lighting and the overall mood Burton and Emmanuel Lubezki, as cinematographer, accomplished here - it really mesmerized me. This is done as a brilliant film noir-esque piece.Even the gore was in context.This is a great film.",Sleepy Hollow
482,canthony,The Pointless Horseman,6,22 November 1999,"I am always shocked when I see the extents to which people have gone to praise a movie which just wasn't that good.  To these people I have to ask, what on earth are you talking about?  No, Sleepy Hollow was not unbearable or terrible.  It was simply uninteresting.  And that in itself is shocking. How can you make a movie about a demon with no head who chases people down on a black horse and chops of their heads uninteresting?  It would have seemed impossible before SH, but Burton pulled off a miracle.  The movie bogs itself down with plot and attempts to add a conspiracy element which simply does not work.  I agree with a previous reviewer that the movie should simply have focus on the horseman himself - but instead by the end of this movie we think of the horseman more like a robot or mindless animal - not the truly evil being he could be.  I think the feel of the initial scene was successfully creepy, but few other instances in the movie succeeded in raising any fright.  I think Johnny Depp went about as far with the role as he could, but I was underwhelmed with Christina Ricci.  I also expected to see more of Walken, but I suppose since his character starts out the movie dead, you can't expect too much.  All in all, not Tim Burton's best work, and probably the worst of the last four movies I have seen (Dogma, Being John Malkovich, Fight Club, The World Is Not Enough).",Sleepy Hollow
483,Lucifer-23,The Headless Horseman Rides With A Vengeance,9,20 November 1999,"From the moment I first saw the previews of Sleepy Hollow, I had my heart set on seeing this film. And to say the least, I was not disappointed with the end results. This film was a visual feast, and one of the most startling contemporary horror films that I have seen. Burton is a master at making film, and this one was , in my opinion, his best. Will it win an oscar or be remembered fifty years from now (like Citizen Kane), who knows? All I can say is that if you go in with that outlook, you might not enjoy it as much as I did. This film drips a gothic ambiance. Everything about it has a flavor that reminds one of the horror films of the sixties (especially the Hammer films). The landscapes transport you away to a world shrouded in mist, where even a forest in broad daylight hides dark secrets and mysterious creatures at every turn. As for the Horseman himself, a demonic dark avenger summoned from beyond the grave, he is an embodiment of evil that is more menacing than many I have seen of late, and excellently brought to life by the combined efforts of a terrifically creepy Christopher Walken (when he had a head) and stuntman extrodinaire Ray Park (of Phantom Menace fame) when he is in full action. Some of the scenes when the Horseman is using his sword and axe are breathtakingly staged. Johnny Depp as Icobad Crane was extremely good, although he seemed a bit of a coward at times. Christina Ricci gets better every time I see her in a movie. The rest of the supporting cast was excellent as well, and I could see that Mr. Burton likes to pull familiar faces around him in even the smallest of roles (like Martin Landau's brief performance). This film is a bit predictable at times, and can be a stretch of the imagination, but well worth the money I paid to see it and at the top of my DVD must-have list.",Sleepy Hollow

So the NYPD sends the troublemaker to sleepy hollow where he have to think in a new way because ghosts do exist. Burton has captured the bedtime story feeling you got in edward scissorhand, but he turn it in to more gore and more action. I think it is definitely worth a look.",Sleepy Hollow
485,Mike Z-2,A Fun and Visually Fantastic Homage to Hammer,8,8 November 2001,"Written around the time of the film's release in Philadelphia, PA,  my senior year of high school.About two weeks before Tim Burton's latest film, Sleepy Hollow, was released, my friend, Dan (SJP '99), informed me that he had four free passes to a sneak preview and asked if I'd like to go.  Having greatly anticipated this film since I had heard rumors of it almost a year before I had no trouble deciding whether or not I wanted to go.  So one Thursday night, a week before its actual release, I sat in the theater and enjoyed the cinematic feast that was set before my eyes.Sleepy Hollow is very loosely based on the Washington Irving short story, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  Instead of being a meek and somewhat dim school teacher, Ichabod Crane is now a wimpy constable from New York City, sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of beheadings.  The story itself is more complex, offering us insight into the history of the infamous Headless Horseman, introducing new characters, and incorporating a mystery involving scandal and witchcraft.  Despite it being so far fetched from the original masterwork, however, I still managed to enjoy the story for what it was rather than focusing on the changes made.As one would expect from a Tim Burton film, the visuals are astoundingly rich with fantastic detail and from the ""painted"" backdrops to the windmill scene nearing the end of the film, one can clearly see how he tried to model his film after the famous Hammer horror films of the 60s and 70s.  Hammer Studios, a company based in Great Britain,  was known for making horror films rich in artistic detail and mostly excellent performances (such as The Horror of Dracula and The Vampire Lovers).  They were not, however, acknowledged for finely wrought plots, satisfying character development, and brilliant scripts.  Burton succeeds in paying homage to Hammer in these aspects as well, though not, surprisingly, to negative effect.Upon seeing previews for Sleepy Hollow, one would reasonably assumed that it is a very serious horror film, but in actuality it is almost completely tongue-in cheek and has a wonderfully dark sense of humor.  Adding to this somewhat campy effect is the apparent glee Burton took in beheading the film's characters.  As the tagline goes, heads certainly do roll and there is plenty of excessive gore to show it.  It is all in good fun, though, as the blood is sometimes so ridiculously unnecessary that it can hardly be taken seriously (which was certainly the director's intended effect).  It seemed that the dialogue was, at times, purposefully over-dramatic, and probably with the same reasoning in mind.The performances fit right in with the rest of the film, which is not to say that they were bad.  Johnny Depp, as the uptight, ""man of reason"" version of Ichabod, gives another excellent performance, as do the rest of the case (including Burton veterans Jeffrey Jones, as the town minister, and Christopher Walken, as, in a brilliant bit of casting, the Headless Horseman).  Christina Ricci, in her role as love interest, Katrina Van Tassel,  seems to stand out as part of Burton's cinematic nod to the Hammer Horror company.  In those films, they would often employ beautiful, blonde women to act as the female leads.  The only problem with them was that they were usually Swedish or, in one case, Polish, and had to learn a British accent for the film they were in, thus explaining their less than flawless British voices.  Hopefully, this is a good explanation for why Ms. Ricci's accent got progressively better throughout the course of the film.  On an extra note, the great Hammer staple, Christopher Lee, appears in a cameo as the judge that sends Ichabod to Sleepy Hollow.Overall, the only two disappointments in the film were the score and the lack of character development.  The score itself was fine and suited the film well, but having heard what Danny Elfman is capable of (just listen to his scores for Beetlejuice and Edward Scissorhands), it seemed very generic. Every once and a while you do hear some bizarre moments of tense strings suited perfectly to the film's off-beat tone, but they are few and far between.  In terms of character development, Ichabod is the focus of the film from beginning to end, and since action is such a key element to the film, there is little time for anyone else to make an impression.Tim Burton's latest work is certainly a masterpiece in terms of visuals and entertainment value, and its dream-like tone, filled with the brilliant Gothic imagery we have all come to expect does not disappoint.",Sleepy Hollow

A wonderful performance by johnny depp make this movie all the more real. the special effects are great. every head looks real and all the action and scenery is great. the dark setting and gothic characters give this movie a sense a depression and dread.

Then I figured that it might be my dad who enjoyed it. He loved it, too.Ditto for my mom. Yeh, I know what you're thinking, you're probably guessing that I didn't enjoy it. Well ,I did.

497,T Sirois,Don't really know what to say (long),8,22 November 1999,"As usual Tim Burton has made himself a fine, worthy movie, let me just start off with that. Visually stunning, representing just what the late 1700s looked like (if it were always dark and gloomy ;)). The acting was very good and Depp did a great job in playing between the boundries of the original Crane character in that, not really a bad guy but overall just a kindof cultured sissy-boy (that's NOT a generalisation) who is just as scared as you or I but knows he has to rise to the occasion eventually anyway. In the book, Crane was always a wimp for the most part.The only thing that bugged me was that the plot as it finally really developed in the end was a bit over-dramatic, maybe too fantastic, not to the point of making it bad, I just think it drew away from an otherwise dark, disturbing and even scarier than I'd presumed, movie would be when I first saw the trailer. I liked the movie, (8/10) and then again I didn't like it for one sole reason.  If you take the movie as what it is, the movie in itself, in that, lets presume there was never the original story, then I liked it quite a lot. But me, I must admit, I'm too retentive to not be annoyed at the drastic changes between what Burton envisioned and the ""real"" story by Irving. Outside of the character names, location and their being a horseman, this movie and the original story are quite quite different.  Not a big deal really as it doesn't make this a BAD movie, again, the movie in itself I enjoyed quite a bit, but I couldn't get over, and its just my pet peeve, the differences.  Things like this always bug me so while I vent please bare with me that its just my opinion. I've never liked it when adaptations change the original story even the slightest bit, though, I can understand sometimes its done due to time, money, and dramatic effect.  I still don't like it :P, but I can understand it and I TRY not to let that ruin my enjoyment of the MOVIE.  I try to take them as two seperate entities.  But the seemingly ""needless to change"" things like the Horseman's origin (how he became headless that is), things like this bug me even more making me wonder, ""I know why the other stuff was changed but why THIS?"".  I don't know, I just don't like it when the original story is changed. But don't let that ruin the movie for you, just forget the original story, enjoy the movie, and if you can do that, you WILL enjoy the movie.",Sleepy Hollow
498,hartje,A VERY good ride,7,16 December 1999,"Tim Burton's incarnation ""Sleepy Hollow"" sends viewers on a journey with Icabod Crane (Johnny Depp), who has been exiled to investigate a series of mysterious murders in upstate New York so as to rid New York City courts of his objections to their methods of ringing in justice. Armed with a plethora of investigative gadgets of his own making, he is much like a panicky, somewhat slow version of Sherlock Holmes ... if he fainted a lot.
Crane meets the cast of town elders and their juniors, as well as Catrina (Christina Ricci), the somewhat enigmatic daughter of the host who summoned him from NYC.The story follows Crane and his young sidekick, an orphaned boy who is perhaps slightly more bold than Crane himself, as they look into the murders, search for the missing heads, and attempt to deduce exactly what the motives could be and who is behind the murders, not to mention who or what the horseman actually is.I enjoyed this film immensely. It had the characteristic Burton touches, where even the use of shades of brown would perhaps be considered too flamboyant for the screen. It used flashbacks effectively to flesh out the Crane character, using bits from his childhood which give the viewer an insight into how he is constituted.Depp delivered an extremely fine performance as the fish-out-of-water constable, and the comedy of the movie reveals itself through Crane. Ricci's performance was acceptable. There really wasn't a great deal that could be done with her character and the voice given Catrina, so no performance would have really shone through. The young sidekick, as well as other supporting characters (including those portrayed by Jeffrey Jones, Miranda Richardson, and Christopher Walken) were played very well, also.The story itself wasn't anything special, nor was the way it was presented. You know what to expect when you go to a Tim Burton movie, and you get it.
The intangible this film delivers is, for lack of a better term, fun. This is a FUN movie to sit back and watch. The chase scenes and fight scenes are top-notch and invite the viewer in to the point where you feel almost as though you're there, trying to avoid becoming the next victim to fall prey to the horseman's sword or axe.It was shot beautifully, had solid performances, and takes the viewer on a ride that eclipses any single element of the film.

In this movie Ichabod Crane is not an English teacher but a New Yrok Constable in the year 1799. The acting in this film is phenomenal Johnny Depp gives quite a performance as Ichabod. He pull off the role quite nicely and is even squeamish like in the book. Now to the violence, decapitations, as you probably know this is the story of Ichabod's disbelief of the legend of the Headless Horseman,who cuts off heads quite cleanly (which is why Ichabod is in Sleepy Hollow in the first place). Now, the decapitations while shown, are not deserving of an R-rating and I believe this film could have gotten away with a PG-13, though there are a few scenes of graphic blood. There is no language or sexual content in this film, which is another reason i believe it could have gotten away with a PG-13.

Either you pity or despise him, you think 'well it's a shame what happened...but he was stupid' or 'I'm glad he died...the money grubbing jerk!' In reality, this just made the character deeper, not to mention the fantastic costumes...gels...scenes. It has an artistic flare, obviously...being a Tim Burton film (as I've mentioned.)

507,mjukr,Burton Once Again Delivers a Fantastic Looking Film,7,20 November 1999,"Tim Burton's latest is a highly polished film visually, with very convincing gloomy sets awash in fog and shallow lighting.  The audience certainly never needs to question believability of the dreary setting. 
Both music and sound effects are put to good use in this, as well as a couple of highly effective implemenations of off-screen space to terrify without explicitly smacking one in the face with an image (although the film certainly has its fair share of decapitations). Be sure to look for the color red as a free visual motif...Although the film looks terrific, the narrative is weak at points.  In particular, Burton's choice of falling back on the annoying situation in which the antagonist proceeds into a five minute monologue near the end of the film in which all of the prior plot events are reviewed and all of the ambiguities are cleared up, is unfortunate and really ruins the pace of the film. On top of that, the love story between Depp and Ricci was thin and unconvincing.  However, Burton's macabre sense of humor really shines in this film, and much of the dialogue involving Depp is very tongue-in-cheek and very amusing (unfortunately, I think many people mistook Burton's sense of humor as either bad scripting or bad acting).  In all, I found this film to be both frightening and humorous, and all-around entertaining.  I just wish it would have been released around Halloween...

The directing and cinematography are excellent, as enticing as a movie can ever be, with some creative, perfect shots to help make this film into art. Chilling and thrilling- yes, indeed, very involving, very gripping is the product of this directing, cinematography, and acting.

His new film, Sleepy Hollow, is another in a line of quirky, and eerie, worlds that this director is fond of creating.Using equally quirky and talented actors, Johnny Depp, and Christina Ricci, he creates another beautifully dark, yet rich textured landscape upon which to tell his tale.Though not adhering to the tale by Washington Irivng strictly, he uses the elements from that story to weave a more dark and sinister story of our famous ""Headless Horseman"".  Depp plays Icabod Crane, and Ricci plays the love interest, Katrina Van Tassle.I thought that Burton smartly created a very moody and very effective canvas on which to paint.  The story, or the actors aren't necessarily the stars here.  What you ""see"" on screen is the star.  No house seems to have a right angle, no sunlight seems to ever shine, in the town you feel dread, outside of town, it looks like a painting.

Watching it, I expected to see a timid, superstitious schoolmaster named Ichabod Crane. However, I am displeased to find it is a constable sent from New York to investigate murders. This is simply laughable. Johnny Depp's performance was mediocre; it was simply Jack Sparrow in 17th century New York. However, this movie did have some good parts. First off, the setting and set creation was extraordinary. The eerily creepy Sleepy Hollow was exactly the way Washington Irving imagined it. The costumes were great. And although I do hate Kevin Yagher for ruining the plot of the story, the dialogue was believable and well-written. Tim Burton did not disappoint with his direction, although some scenes could have been better. All in all, if you are a fan of the book, you will not be seeing the original story.

I can not forget the scene when Hessian Horseman hold Lady Van Tassel on his hand and kiss her with blood then ride into the tree of Death... But I didn't know I should cry or laugh with Johnny's acting, very crazy but also very great. And Christina Ricci is great too, I love her character, a witch who loved an investigator who never believed in magic and was saved by him at last. Yes, Johnny and Ricci is a nice couple in this great Fantasy/Horror movie. And if u love Johny and Ricci, don't miss this movie...",Sleepy Hollow
520,reetu-raj,stunning story,8,8 May 2005,"Story was great, along with the performances of the actors. It was all about revenge , love and witch-crafts. The story takes you back in early 19th century in the new york city and city known as sleepy hollow, where Johnny depp, a constable in new york is sent to sleepy hollow to investigate a case which involves decapitation of many persons by a beheaded man who comes on horse and decapitate so called innocent people of the sleepy hollow. His investigation because of his spirit which believed in logic , action and results, leads to covering a fact about van family.The viewer is bound to suspect many people as story revolves, but each time the point of suspicion keeps on moving and makes the plot interesting enough to hold your seat until yo finally come to know the unexpected villain, and the person who was behind all those murder !",Sleepy Hollow
521,CinematicEddy,One of the best looking horror film in years,8,18 February 2015,"What a beautiful movie to look at, it's gorgeous, Tim Burton's vision of Washington Irving's tale feels alive!'Sleepy Hollow' is the new incarnation of hammer horror, a genre long gone, and Burton is able to get the exact point that made the hammer horror films so unique. The plot is about Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp), a constable who moves to the town of Sleepy Hollow to solve a series of murders that have been happening there, all murders with the same M.O., their heads removed from their bodies.The screenplay is very based on the hammer style of filmmaking, it is very different from the book, confused, and well... It seems like a Scooby-Doo episode, but that is not entirely bad, the movie still haves a very good conclusion and feels complete.'Sleepy Hollow' may not be what you think you'll get, but it is no doubt a very good film!",Sleepy Hollow
522,petersea,Best scary movie ever!,10,27 September 2005,"This film is excellent. it is truly awesome. It has a star studded cast including Johnny Depp!. Not for the faint hearted though as this film mixes Gothic, gory and plain heads rolling around with romance, hilarity in a way and filled with the hottest of hot Johnny Depp who plays Ichabod Crane an intelligent yet perhaps slightly wimpy detective. He faints 7 times for crap's sake! I do feel the movie lacks faults as it is always good to laugh at stupid mistakes people make! This film is really worth seeing and will make you scared of axes forever. it send that cold yet exciting chill down your spine and will make you want to see it again and again. And even again and again.",Sleepy Hollow
523,xhuliano-39816,Way out of my expectations,1,11 December 2019,"I hated this script. I was waiting and i was waiting for a logical explanation. But no, everythig happened for the revenge,the money and all was achieved through magic. Bad script in my opinion. Having been a fan of Sherlock Holmes movies and series i was very disappointed.",Sleepy Hollow
524,Snoogins,A really cool film.,10,20 November 1999,"Sleepy Hollow is the best Tim Burton film to date.  The film has an excellent mix of horror and humor, and Ray Park deserves credit for coming up with some really cool swordfighting sequences.  Johnny Depp gives a good performance as Ichabod Crane and the special effects look really good.  Go check this film out, it doesn't disappoint.",Sleepy Hollow
525,Firefly-28,Made me Sleepy * 1 Spoiler Ahead *,3,27 November 1999,"If your going to see a scary movie don't see this. The whole crowd laughed through it, and I don't think it was because the movie was funny but how bad it was. When you have a demon that has eyes and a tongue that pops out in computer animation like when Jim Carrey wore the mask you know you've wasted six dollars. Well at least I did. The idea seemed fascinating Tim Burton directing a movie based on the short story 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow'. Then Christina Ricci was cast. I was definitely seeing this. However I was very disappointed. The Headless Horseman was not mysterious ( which I think he needed to be ). And  he was controlled by someone so it becomes a who-done-it Scream like film. But there's so many twists I could n't understand a lot of things and even the people who liked it couldn't. Another problem with the movie is that there's so many characters and no development of any of them you don't feel bad when they lose their head or even care if they're being attacked. Which makes the movie lack suspense. The ending felt rushed. And Christina Ricci's character wasn't even needed ( yeah she was great with the little she had to work with ). Christina Ricci's onscreen stepmom's dialogue made me roll my eyes. And gore doesn't bother me but it's NOT funny. Especially when you keep using it. And Christopher Walken's costume and barking dialogue .... HAHAHA can we say cheesy.",Sleepy Hollow
526,aircou,The Best Film of 1999.,10,4 July 2000,"Forget American Beauty - Sleepy Hollow is the best film of 1999. It simply stands out more than any of the other films we saw in 1999. The acting is simply superb (Johnny Depp is great), the direction from Tim Burton is of high quality and very well done, the costumes, set decoration and visual effects are stunning, scary but overall beautiful.The best thing about Sleepy Hollow is that is a film like no other. Sure, we have seen a lot of Sleepy Hollow versions, but instead of a big joke, this one stands out. The film is absolutely terrifying, yet hilarious and action packed in a simply beautiful way.Sleepy Hollow is #2 on my Top 150 films of all time. My rating: Easily 10/10.",Sleepy Hollow
527,hessianmercenary,A splendid work of ART.,10,12 September 2000,"First of all, Sleepy Hollow has apparently two distinctive characteristics among most of the movies I watched. These are:   1- It was one of the few movies which I can really regard as a ""work of art"",  2- It was almost excellent in EVERY aspect.  Yes; briefly, this masterpiece was almost excellent in every aspect: Marvelous costumes; impressive music by Danny Elfman; fabulous cinematography, which should have got the OSCAR instead of American Beauty; breathtaking plot by A. Kevin Walker ( se7en ) and Kevin Yagher ( what a brilliant idea to make a new version of Irving's well-known story); great direction and art direction, which brought it a well-deserved OSCAR and wonderful cast including Martin Landau and Christopher Lee--- I especially loved Christopher Walken's cool portrayal of the Hessian Horseman and certainly his teeth! For now, he is my favorite villain.   On the other hand, the most obvious aspect wrong with this movie was the crucial exposition, which was unduly rushed and could have been much longer in order to let the audience fathom the full plot.  ( Warning: STOP here. This might be a spoiler for you.) Now, I would like to reply to the friend who criticized this movie for the exploding windmill. Here is an article that states that windmills DO EXPLODE in particular circumstances  such as the ones in the movie:   Cinefex says: ""An explosion is precipitated by clouds of stirred flour, which have made the air combustible. It is a strange fact, but you can have explosions in flour mills."" stated Paddy Eason. ""Ichabod throws an oil lamp into the mill and everything goes bang...""   (Spoiler END) Finally, I would like to point out that you may not like this movie since it does not appeal to everyone, but it is still a great movie then. I give it a well-deserved 10/10.",Sleepy Hollow
528,Lonejack,Humorous and quirky,8,28 August 2000,"This film is definitely a quirky adaptation of the original Washington Irving story. It has Tim Burton's handiwork all over it, just look at interesting camera angles, dark scenes and quirky humor.I think Johnny Depp played the slightly unbalanced Icabod Crane quite well, keeping Burton's dark humor just under the surface of the character. Besides, Depp is at his best in a character role, i.e. Benny & Joon, Cry Baby, Dead Man, Ed Wood, etc. Christina Ricci also performed well as a Burton character, though more on the beautiful but mysterious side rather than the dark humor of Depp's character.I recommend it to horror/suspense fans, especially Depp, Burton and Ricci fans.",Sleepy Hollow
529,Cosefox,Great classic feel horror film!,8,26 June 2001,I loved this movie because it reminded me of the old classic horror films. Tim Burton was the perfect choice to direct this film and as a result it is a film that is not only creepy in all the right ways but visually spectacular.  The Art Direction was very worthy of the academy award awarded.  Johnny Depp uses his quirkiness well in reinventing Icabod Crane helping to give this story not only an edge but also a freshness.,Sleepy Hollow
530,Saila,Tim Burton does it again,10,20 August 2001,"Tim Burton is known from his original and quite gothic style of directing. He can create a whole new (and usually dark) world with extraordinary features. And Sleepy Hollow is no exception. The master of imagination has done it again.I don't want to tell anything the plot or describe any of the characters thus I want everybody to make their own interpretations and because it could spoil someone's experience of the film.So what was so amazing about the film? It was visually astounding. Every ray of light, every flower, every house..EVERYTHING was set so carefully. My eye didn't catch any imperfection or anything that didn't please me. It was just like from a fairytale, and that it certainly was. Pure fantasy, pure imagination that took my breath from the very first second. and the cast seemed to live -not act- in that dark and gloomy but nevertheless fabulously imaginative world.I highly recommend this movie to anyone that has a mind of a child and at least a hint of imagination.",Sleepy Hollow
531,MrsObvious,Black humour!,10,29 July 2003,"The sets were fatastic, the acting was superb and I loved the black humour packed into all the dialogues, expressions and acts of the characters. The film didn't take itself too serious, which was very important. The plot was tricky and surprising, all in all a good piece of work!Johnny Depp was marvellous, as was Christina Ricci (though black suits her better ;))",Sleepy Hollow
532,mork_blasphemy,Short review,8,7 July 2011,"I'm going to make a short but hopefully straight forward review!!It is with no doubt an entretainning movie which is what we all expect from movies,the acting was absolutely perfect on all aspects ,I wouldn't say it is a horror movie ,it sure has that aspect but in the end I can say securely that the movie can be seen in family,yes you'll see a severed head but not in a shocking way!!I gave this movie an 8 a hard 8 and i recommend it to absolutely everyone above the age of 12!! On a final note the graphic aspect of the movie is absolutely genial,we just need to see who made it,so we can expect the dark shadowy ambiance that all Tim Burton movies have but at the same time it goes so so well with the characters and the rural environment in with the action is set!!",Sleepy Hollow
533,ajmilne,Visually stunning,7,9 October 2007,"Lush, gorgeous, glitteringly dark--a gloomy, misty landscape of twisted, black trees, and looming shadows--Sleepy Hollow is visually breathtaking. Budding directors, cinematographers, and set directors should be required to watch this film as a textbook study into how one establishes atmosphere. Elfman's score is a jewel as well, the perfect complement to all this visual mastery. At once sumptuous and ominous, brooding on horrors seen and horrors to come, it sets off the misty, haunted look of the thing perfectly.Beyond this, cast and casting are inspired--a wonderful gallery of oddly matched talents, note-perfect in their various roles. Depp is a strangely lovely Ichabod Crane, faithful, all the same, in spirit to the original: quirky, overwrought, his constant efforts to exude competence and confidence are continually undermined by the brutal reality that he is never more than a few short steps from becoming entirely unhinged by the wanton irrationality that abounds in this haunted rural corner of early America. This is Crane as a would-be man of science; uncomfortably finding himself on the trail of a headless ghost, he's determined nonetheless to rise to the challenge and see that justice is done. In his portrayal, Depp achieves a stammering, flustered delivery and gawky physicality that evoke the character perfectly. Ricci, for her part, is cast smartly half against type: playing a coolly beautiful, wide-eyed fairy tale princess, she brings a note of self-assurance and self-possession to the part that makes it as memorable as any of her more overtly dark roles: she's a heroine to complement Depp's Ichabod, composed where he's addled and alarmed, in her element where he's out of his depth. And yes, they do look awfully good together. Add to these principals a wonderfully mixed and matched stable of fine, nuanced English character actors, one icon of the horror genre and a few familiar old faces and favourites of Burton: Richardson, Lee, McDiarmid, Walken, Gambon, Jones, and there's some serious wattage on the screen, here, all generally put to very good use. There are some nice flashes of dark comedy, too, as you'd only expect from Burton. All of which makes the film, all in all, a fine mix of beautiful things.That's what's great about Sleepy Hollow; see it, if for nothing else, for all that mist and shadow--on the big screen or in the gorgeous HD DVD version, if you possibly can, for Burton works this canvas beautifully, and you do want to see it in all the detail you can. And see it for Depp and Ricci, Lee (in a cameo, technically, but it's a key one, and he makes every second count), and Richardson.There are, however, also more than a few weaker spots, here. Burton billed Sleepy Hollow as an homage to the classic Hammer horror films, and it does evoke that very feel, frequently--both for better and for worse. Yes, there's mist and mystery, a suggestion of supernatural dread lurking in every long shadow, and some reasonably affecting horror--but there's also a fairly liberal dash of fake blood (occasionally used for a nice comic effect, but then overused), and a little more latex gore than I've a taste for, personally. The failing is a common one in horror: the old 'too much on the screen/not enough left to the frightened imagination' problem. Having established that beautifully spooky, haunted atmosphere, Burton seems to think he can lean harder on it than he can, goes all kinetic and bloody, in the end, and the whole winds up a good notch or two more overt than it probably should have been, reveling just a little too much in the gore, and inevitably failing, therefore, to use it as powerfully as it might have to terrify. The horseman of the title itself, especially, though brilliantly menacing, initially, loses much of that menace as it becomes too familiar a presence on the screen, and this only gets worse and worse as the film proceeds. I found myself almost wishing Burton had had slightly less effective effects at his command: it might have helped, a little, if he'd been forced by technical limitations to keep his beloved whirling headless horseman o' death in the shadows a little more, let us be a little more afraid of what we can't see.All that said: yes, it's quite worth the time. Absolutely do see it. Against those weaknesses, the sheer dark beauty of the visuals and the general brilliance of the cast make it well worthwhile.",Sleepy Hollow
534,Vafthrudnir,Astoundingly Overrated,4,6 April 2004,"The original review I had planned for this movie was perhaps a little over-harsh, so I'll preface with the good: Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beer-and-pizza or sleepover movie, the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and no-one's really focusing on the movie. The visual elements are beautiful, and it is kinda fun, in parts. But horror, my friends, it is not. I made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off. If this is your intention, send me a personal message and I'll offer you a list of alternate recommendations. (That's a serious offer, by the way. True horror fans deserve better.) Now my complaints, complete with SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS Why bother even making a movie ""based"" on a classic story if you're not even going to attempt to stay true to the sense, feel, tone, or theme of the original? Listen carefully between the lines of ill-written dialogue and you'll hear the slow churn of Washington Irving rolling over in his grave. I will even accept the Big-City Detective bit, but... Ricci drawing warding-hexes around the bed? Come, now. Not only is there nothing even vaguely like this in ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"", but it's historical BUNK. I don't care what neo-pagan axe you have to grind, but in the 18th century, ""witchcraft"" meant selling your soul to the Devil in exchange for diabolical powers; this whole fluffy white-witch goddess-worship ""an'-it-harm-none"" approach to witchcraft dates back, historically, about as far as the British Invasion. (Parties interested in real old-school pagan practices are referred to James Frazer's ""The Golden Bough"", if you don't believe me.) This creates such a discordant element thrown into the context of the film that the very framework of the Sleepy Hollow legend is shattered. So we wind up with a totally different story altogether. If that was Burton's idea, I wish he'd warned us in advance. Also, I wish he'd come up with a better story than the rather pedestrian one witnessed here. And he might as well have dropped the Irving pretensions altogether. And, at any rate, the movie isn't scary. Not once. Not at all. The warped tree came close, but was more than counterbalanced by the laughable effect of the Hessian's farce-comedy bellowing. And finally, yes, I too wanted Christina Ricci for Christmas, but God clearly never meant her to be a blonde.",Sleepy Hollow
535,a_kilpatrick,this movie is sooooooooooo cool,10,26 March 2005,"oh my god, i saw this movie at a friends party for the first time and the next day I was begging my parents to buy it!!! i have always loved johnny depp's acting (and spectacularly good looks) and this movie just made them both 210% better...one of my absolute favorite parts in the movie would have to have been the scene after he finally realizes that it IS a headless horseman killing off people and he is in his bed huddling in the corner and going completely insane. Most likely my favourite movie of all time... I especially like the tagline: Heads will roll :p haw deehaw deehaw..... If you like Johnny Depp as much as I do, and know the story is already good, then go see this",Sleepy Hollow
536,Shadowgirl78,Good movie,8,27 March 2006,"I love this movie! Edge of your seat and keep you guessing who did it until the end. Tim Burton adds a great touch with Crane's mother, keeping Crane real and showing us why Crane became the way that he did.The flashbacks add a real sense of mystique, offering us deeper insight into Ichabod Crane. It is nice to see that after conducting an autopsy and seeing his opponent in action at night, that Crane is still afraid of everyday things like spiders! Wonderfully acted, sends chills down the spine for a continual ride through the woods! Christopher Walken portrayed an excellent headless horseman. The CG effects were nicely done as well.",Sleepy Hollow
537,B.Thayer,Burton + Elfman = Perfection Again,9,24 November 1999,"Happily, the film starts with action - then lets you breathe. Humorous elements are thrown in at appropriate times to keep you from messing your pants. Overall, I found it suspenseful - and the ending a complete surprise. The visuals are greatly enhanced by Danny Elfman's haunting score. After all, what's a Burton flick without Elfman tunes?",Sleepy Hollow
538,breturi7,Burton's a Genius,9,22 December 1999,"""Sleepy Hollow"" is Tim Burton's ""Sistine Chapel Ceiling.""  It is a terrific, complex, funny, film that ties in every known movie genre known to man.  This movie would have sucked BIG TIME had some other, less visionary director taken the reigns, but Mr. Burton is a truly gifted artist. I've heard many complaints that the movie is too cliched, too cheesy, too hokie, to formulaic.  THAT'S THAT POINT!  It's Burton poking fun at the ""by-the-book"" horror movies.  To me, some of the funniest parts in the movie were the most cliched because it's ALL tongue-in-cheek.  The movie's got the usual cliched chase scene, the usual ""villain-tells-plans"" scene, the usual cheesy lines (""You've bewitched me.""....""Is he dead?"" ""That's the problem. He was already dead.""), but that's what MAKES this movie, the fact that it can completely poke fun at the genre while being a great movie on the side. Not only is Burton a master at this sort of double-handed perspective, his visuals, the dark and foreboding world he has created, is something which must be seen in order to be believed.  He truly is a visionary of film. And the actors/actresses....if I were to start with them, I'd be here typing all day.  Let's just say that each one is PERFECT for their given roles, Depp and Ricci, especially. Same goes for the score. In closing: GO SEE IT ON THE BIG SCREEN!",Sleepy Hollow
539,4ize,"Not horror, just horrible",3,24 November 1999,"I had high expectations for Sleepy Hollow because of Tim Burton's previous work and the intriguing trailer, which promised a very macabre, eerie take on the Washington Irving tale. The story supplies plenty of raw material for a director interested in examining fear, jealousy, superstition and the dark side of human nature. Instead, what I saw was just another effects-driven big-budget waste of time. Way too much emphasis was placed on creating the spooky atmosphere - how many shots of fog, storm clouds and bare trees do we need to see? OK, Tim, we get it - Sleepy Hollow is a gloomy place. Now would someone please light a lantern and get on with the story? The village is so damp and dreary I'm surprised everyone didn't die of pneumonia before the Headless Horseman ever showed up.The screenplay seems to exist solely for the purpose of creating opportunities to spend more special effects dollars, but even the goriest scenes are not frightening. There's no mystery here. We know that before long Mr. Headless will show up again and lop the head off some character. His scenes reminded me of the knight in ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail.""The dialogue is stilted and phony. And wasn't it odd that Miranda Richardson adopted a convincing American accent while other cast members, especially Johnny Depp, put on awful Brit accents? Depp was just plain bad. His Ichabod Crane is a campy, foppish twit. He looks silly pursing his lips with all the color drained from his face.The screenwriters have tried to turn this into some sort of murder mystery, but the plot is so needlessly complicated that we don't know or care why people are being whacked. The tale would have been better served by writers who know how to craft a tight, suspenseful story. A big disappointment.",Sleepy Hollow
540,xenarf!,all i can say is OUCH..,4,21 November 1999,"Alas, the day of the fall of Burton has come. We all knew it had to come, as with other legendaries before him (such as Raimi - For Love of the Game? Bleech!). It seemed this film would have been much less painful to watch if the complicated-to-the-point-of-jargon script was abandoned and the entire movie consisted of the Headless Horseman doing his own thing. No point to ANY of the characters...ANY! Why did Casper van Dien bother gaining 30 lbs for a 30-second role??? Danny Elfman seems to have lost all ability to compose his classically haunting scores. At least i agree with the title - the writer must have been both SLEEPY and HOLLOW at the time.",Sleepy Hollow
541,Alizaria,I hated this movie,2,19 December 1999,"I have in the past loved Tim Burton. I loved Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and even Mars Attacks. But I hate this movie. The costume drama scenes in the beginning were the sort of poorly done, stodgy things that used to plague historical drama 25 years ago. Then there were all the head-cutting scenes, which just left me cold, and that's the sort of thing that ought to mean something, I would think. Yes, there were some nice bare trees and foggy evenings and the horseman jumping out of the tree was a nice special effect, but on the whole the movie was just boring and pointless.",Sleepy Hollow
542,changeling69,WOW WOW WOW!!!!!,10,8 December 1999,"Finally a version of Sleepy Hollow, to actually explore the background of Ichabod Crane, so they changed his profession, not a big deal.

The cinematics and the soundtrack provided by Danny Elfman were among the best I have seen this year.  Tim Burton does a wonderful job in selecting what we saw on film, and the music only helped seal the images.  Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance as Constable Crane, and the four town elders all do a superb job.It seemed to me that no expense was spared in making this film.  The special effects were great and the screenplay was well written.  I had my doubts at first as to how they could make this short story into a two hour movie, but the writers did an excellent job.  I was guessing who the responsible party was until the end, and I couldn't guess the motive right until it was revealed.Overall, the movie was very complete due to a spectacular script and very good eye candy backed up with an excellent score.",Sleepy Hollow
544,nismohalos,Awesome movie!,10,3 December 2000,"This movie is fantastic. I didn't watch this movie in theaters because I didn't especially like the cast and that I absolutely hated Tim Burton's Batman movies.  He makes everything so dark, you can't tell whether it's day or night and a lot of times you can't even see squat!However, his style works great on 'Sleepy Hollow'!  The scenery is believable and the costumes are very nice. Depp, Ricci, and pretty much everyone else did a great job, they are all very talented.and the Hessian Horseman is my new favourite villain, he is so cool, I bet you he can kick both Michael Myer's and Freddie Krueger as*es!  The sword fighting scenes are very exciting, almost as good as the Highlander movies. But the sad thing is that the headless horseman (Ray Park) is not credited.So please do yourself a favour and rent this movie.

545,mark.saunders6,A moody masterpiece,10,20 February 2000,"This is my film of 2000. I know, there hasn't been a lot of 2000 yet, but still... I went to see this as a curiosity, as I like Tim Burton's films generally, and was expecting a competent film version of Washington Irving's story (luckily, I'd managed to avoid seeing any trailers, so I just knew the story of the Legend). What I wasn't expecting was such a perfect film. For me, it succeeded on all fronts. There was something almost indefinable about the exterior sets which gave the film an amazing feeling of pervading evil, and it's perhaps this which made the film succeed so well. The acting was universally suitable (including a small part for Hammer veteran Christopher Lee) - Depp, in particular, managed his usual trick of being fascinating to watch, and even turned out a good English accent; the direction was strong - I was glued to the screen throughout the film (never a thought of ""How much longer to go?"" or ""What time is it?""); the film's script was intelligent and compelling - Depp's character being, quite rightly, the core and most important invention to ""flesh out"" the Sleepy Hollow Legend into a proper cinematic story; the Horseman was perfectly realised - none of the old unbelievable ""extended shoulders"" trick (I later read that they painstakingly deleted the actor's balaclava'd head from EVERY frame of the film in which the Horseman appears!); and all of this was supported by thebeautifully-lit sets, which, as I say, sustained a mood of nightmare-like evil all through the film. I can't wait for it's release on video!",Sleepy Hollow

549,ABernst100,"""One heck of a real scary film""",10,27 January 2001,"Being from New York myself, I found ""Sleepy Hollow"" a real horrifying film. The writers' idea of making ""Ichabod Crane"" as a scientific policeman instead of a wimpy schoolteacher was brilliant. Johnny Depp was sensational as Crane. Christina Ricci has come far since her days as Wednesday Addams. Here she is, at 19, playing a good romantic role as Katrina Van Tassel, leading the constable on a roller coaster ride of ""she loves me, she loves me not"". Michael Gambon and Miranda Richardson are magnificent as Lord and Lady Van Tassel. Jeffrey Jones is as menacing as ever. Ian McDiarmid (Senator Palpatine of ""Star Wars: Episode 1"") delivers a fine role as the town doctor. Casper Van Dien comes across again as a romantic figure in the form of the town smithy (unfortunately, he shoes no horses). Young Marc Pickering is a talented youngster and will probably prove himself to be a fine actor in the future. An unbilled but recognizable Martin Landau gives a great, but all too short and silent, portrayal of Peter Van Garrett, one of the Hessian's first victims. ""X-Men""s Ray Park delivers one heck of a performance as the Hessian (sans head) as does Christopher Walken (with bright blue eyes and saber-teeth), even though he does little more than growl and snarl. It was also a change of pace seeing Christopher Lee playing someone other than Dracula. Washington Irving's original story of an actual murder spree in upstate New York, circa 1735, is improved on, turning it from a light, scary Halloween story to a fantastic whodunit murder mystery.",Sleepy Hollow

The cinematography of Sleepy Hollow, captivates the audience, and portrays just the right mood for this horror, thriller, comedy. Kudos to Johnny's over the top performance of the forensics scientist Ichabod even though the acting may falter in some scenes (esp. the fainting). An all-star cast from both Europe and America, very talented.  This seems like Tim Burton's ode to the classic Black Sunday by Mario Bava on terms of mood and setting. Some jumpy scenes and an awesome headless horseman makes this movie a winner.",Sleepy Hollow
553,Sweet_Fiddler,i'm the girl who would take ichabod crane over captain jack ANY day,8,10 September 2008,"I've never been one of these girls who go all ga-ga when they pass Johnny Depp memorabilia in shopping malls. Like him as an actor, but he's not my idea of beautiful (don't throw stones at me!) Yet, I must say, I was ""enchanted,"" to say the least, seeing Depp play this sweet, mild-mannered, quirky, terrified, and heroic (in the under-dog way) character, Ichabod Crane.For those of us who have actually read Washington Irving's novel prior to seeing the film, it is NOT the same story...No spoilers, I promise, but one thing I truly love about this film is the quiet little romance subtly weaving through the entire film: Ichabod and Katrina. I never realized to the full extent the intriguing beauty of Christina Ricci until this film. She expels a sort of Catherine-Linton-aura about her, which makes her bashfully breathtaking. I love the quiet courtship that goes on between the two characters.That is why I classify this as a love story. A love story behind a bizarre and bloody nightmare that IS Tim Burton, and my number one favorite Johnny Depp film.",Sleepy Hollow

It was every bit as wonderful now as it was then.I think this movie is escapism in its purest form. For those of us who love the idea of atmospheric, mysterious, dangerous and thrilling places, it's pure joy to look upon Sleepy Hollow - dark, Gothic and very real. So much of this movie is the look and feel of this world and its characters. When you see the headless horseman on his horse, riding in the dark night with the wind blowing wildly, it is visual ecstasy.The music, composed by Danny Elfman, is fantastical and reinforces the magical quality of Sleepy Hollow. His score is a wonderful, pulsating accompaniment that energizes the action and mystifies character scenes.I love this movie for what it is, and I am grateful that there are movie makers who love to create what seems outlandish and unrealistic to skeptics.",Sleepy Hollow
555,dangerous_mind,Where's your head at?,9,24 August 2005,"Before we begin with our analysis of this movie, let's have a look at the following list:a) directed by Tim Burton (check) b) starring Johnny Depp (check) c) creepy Gothic atmosphere and great fx (double check)Okay, if a movie (about the legend of Sleepy Hollow) contains the elements I listed above, you KNOW it can't go wrong. Especially Christopher Walken's appearance as the Hessian Horseman is brilliant. To sum it up: 'Sleepy Hollow' is not overdone, it's bloody and scary but you can have a good laugh at times, which only adds to the magic of Tim Burton movies. The best movies know how to keep the fragile balance between a total slash-fest (which it totally wasn't - POSSIBLE SPOILER: every time a head gets cut off, there's hardly any blood) and subtle humour. It's not laugh-out-loud but people, this is Johnny Depp. He's a genius, it's as simple as that. The way the tension builds forced me stay in front of the screen. I did not want to miss a second of it, and I'm sure you'll agree with me when it's your time to watch 'Sleepy Hollow'. You get sucked into the action and you'll feel the unstoppable need to join Depp's character on his mission reveal the truth.A real classic and must-see-must-have. Two thumbs up!",Sleepy Hollow
556,Mucky,Style AND Substance.,8,25 November 1999,"From the moment this movie opens you know a master like Tim Burton has to be behind it. Dark, detailed, and it retains a kind of ""I am taking myself seriously, but not by much,"" humor. The costumes and sets are spectacular, and it will be a travesty if at least the costumes are not recognized by the Academy.Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane is very good. I've never read the story so I don't exactly know what Crane is supposed to be like, but I remember the Disney movie well and Depp seems to pull that off well 8). Most of the other performances are also above average, though I was honestly a little disappointed that Walken (the Hessian) didn't have any spoken lines (well, that is if ""ARRRRRH!"" doesn't count as a spoken line). He's always been a favorite of mine. But he was obviously having fun.So my vote is an 8, an above average movie, and we definitely get what we're promised: plenty of heads do roll.",Sleepy Hollow

This is definitely a Burton movie - beautiful Gothic sets & costumes, subtle (and more blatant, too) irony/humor, and the other usual suspects (jack-o-lanterns, claymation-esque animation, etc.). I found this movie to be completely entertaining, but there were several points that were just soo cheesy, he had to have included them tongue-in-cheek (one hopes).

It's not really a typical horror and not even supposed to be a comedy (although there are a bit too many laughs than normal) but it has a great plot that is played excellently.  Christopher Walken is excellent as the Headless Horseman, once again showing that he is one of a few band of actors that can play bad guys really convincingly.  Overall, a film that has to be watched!!",Sleepy Hollow

What the movie lacks in story is countered well with Burton's flair with visuals. The town of Sleepy Hollow is breathtakingly realized, as well as the countless, grisly beheadings. Incidentally, stunt man Ray Park plays the year's two best villains: Darth Maul of The Phantom Menace, and, when it's not Christopher Walken, the Headless Horseman.",Sleepy Hollow

However, if you see it hoping to see an entertaining movie, you will definitely enjoy it. I myself do not like needless gore, but for this story the gore was necessary. Also, there was more to the story than just the gore. It was very funny, and it also had a little bit of mystery to it, although it wasn't that difficult to figure out who was behind it all. Overall, I think that Sleepy Hollow would have to be considered one of Burton's five best films, only behind the two Batmans, Ed Wood, and Beetlejuice.",Sleepy Hollow
564,thalazy1,A fun thrill ride that will make you forget Disney's classic.,10,19 November 1999,"I saw the movie today and wow was I impressed, the visuals were amazing. The atmosphere was dark and moody, the story while not 100% true to the book still captures all that we love from the story. It's thrilling and actually funny. The gore is not as bad as I thought it would be it almost could of had a PG-13 rating in my eyes. If you want a fun, dark, funny, exciting movie than this is the one to see, it delivers.

Whether you consider this overly gory or not, I found this movie great fun and one of the best that Tim Burton has put out.  However, I greatly enjoyed Sleepy Hollow.First, the plot line is tightly constructed and makes sense unlike recent movies.  Although it differs from the traditional tale by Irving, the story is a welcome change.The cinematography is spectacular - dark and foreboding like it should be. Ricci as well as the other actors in the film are fantastic.My only gripes would be the quick unfolding of the storyline at the end of the movie.  The explanation of the sequence of events was too quick and convoluted at times.  Other than that, I can't find many problems with the film.Great work!",Sleepy Hollow

This movie has the most decapitations I've ever seen in one film, gory as hell.    For the Tim Burton fans out there, this movie is definitely for you.  I loved this movie and hope to see many more films of the same genre.  10/10 all the way. Check it out.",Sleepy Hollow

The special effects were really good and well done.The camera work was remarkable. It brought out the environment in a way that I never imagined.

The costumes were phenomenal, the casting perfect, the script - pretty good and the music, well has Danny Elfman really ever gone wrong? I feel bad saying that this film made me laugh more than it scared me, although it did have it's moments of fright. I think perhaps it was Depp's wooden performance that made me laugh.

In this movie, we find out the history of the infamous Headless Horseman, which is quite interesting. Now, the Cinematography in the movie was so good, that it was actually inspiring.

I love the way Burton lets loose and dives into the gory tale with great passion and enthusiasm. Furthermore, it is wonderful to see violence being used in a honest and cynical manner.

578,scfc,Comedy kills the atmosphere,5,29 January 2004,"Sleepy Hollow is a wonderfully set film - you can feel what living in those ages must have been like. But two major flaws severely harm the movie. First, Sleepy Hollow starts as a ""detective story"". You wonder who killed the victims, how and why. And while your mind imagines possible answers, the filmmakers retreat to the world of fantasy - no evil plan, clever tricks or any of that. It's like if in JFK, Oliver Stone would have made Superman be the killer. Second, from time to time comical situations pop up. This totally ruins the atmosphere. You have Johnny Depp wandering around this dark place with a very serious facial expression, and the next thing you know, he is either standing on a chair for his fear of a spider or ridiculously splattering himself with blood. Therefore, I'd rather recommend to you watching From Hell - or Police Academy.",Sleepy Hollow

The cast was great, especially Johnny Depp by bringing humor and those spectacular disgusted faces to the film. Burton has outdone himself with the thrills and chills but also the dry humor. The music by Elfman always sets the mood perfectly. I read the story by Washington Irving, and all I can say is, do NOT expect it to be like the story. Burton has given it a dark and harrowing twist that greatly satisfies. If you haven't seen this movie, go out and see it.

580,slashgnfnr,What a Great Movie,10,13 May 2004,"I own this movie on DVD and watched it for the first time in about a year last week, and it made me realize what a great movie it really is.  To truly appreciate Sleepy Hollow you need to watch it a few times and absorb the beauty surrounding it.First off, Tim Burton did an amazing job casting this movie.  Of course everyone always loves everything Johnny Depp does, but his performance in this is one of the best of his career.  Christina Ricci is a perfect choice, she has that ethereal beauty and the dark yet angelic aura.  And having Christopher Walken as the horseman is awesome, because he is one of those actors who can be a real badass when he wants to.  I also liked Jeffry Jones as the scandalous priest, for he always plays characters who are a little shady.  And it was cool to see Casper Van Dien finally in a good movie! I liked him in Starship Troopers as Rico and he is perfect in this as the all braun no brains badass.  Basically all th supporting cast enhance this movie and make it that much better.The storyline is fairly complex but not overly hard to follow.  By the end you know what's going on, but you can still pick up on little things if you watch it a few times giving it some replay value in that respect.  The dialogue is good but there are a couple odd lines and a few one liners that are kind of cheesy""  i.e. ""watch your head"" or ""your just in time to have you head cut off"" etc.  But for the most part, all the one liners are delivered well and are humorous.Overall the dialogue is pretty strong and witty.Where the film really shines is in the visuals.  My god, this movie just looks so damn cool!  Everything has an dark, gothic surrealism to it.  There is a fall setting with fog surrounding the landscape at all times, and it is always dark and spooky.  All the characters have pale white skin and everything in the scenery looks purposely fake, which is what makes it so cool.  It's just so beautiful to look at and it really adds to the fantasy aspect of the tale that has elements of halloween, witchcraft, legends and lore interwoven throughout.  It's almost as if your watching a play.  This movie is the most visually satistfying movie I have ever seen.  Its just art, plain and simple.:::some spoilers coming up::: This movie is also very badassed.  There are some great death scenes amongst other background images you may notice.  First of all, the scene where Cas Van Dien is cut in 2, man that was stylish.  Second, when the Horseman stakes the guy through the chest, and drags his body so his head is just off the holy ground so he can lop it off, that was just genious.  And the bloody kiss at the end was disturbingly hilarious.  There were also little things that added to the nostalgia of the film such as the little boys spook candle that lit the room, or the flames that burst into a face when the horseman came, or the pumpkin headed scarecrow. :::end spoilers:::A lot of my friends hate this movie, and I always give them hell for it.  Just don't expect it to be a horror film.  It's more of a gothic fantasy tale with some black comedy.  It's a visual extravaganza with the enhancement of great acting/casting, a good storyline, and amazing imagery, not to be missed.  I give it 9.5/10 stars.",Sleepy Hollow

And even though Christopher Walken only got the line ""ARGH!"" i thought he did well with the action. This movie does get really violent, but hey, it's Tim Burton. I say this is the best Tim Burton movie I have ever seen (Big Fish is a close second), some parts are a bit weird, but thats only a few scenes.

In what I consider to be his darkest film ever, Burton delves deep into his lifelong obsession with everything gothic.  In short, Sleepy Hollow is a salute to the Vincent Price and Hammer Horror films Burton viewed growing up (Good ol' Chris Lee gets a nod in his brief roll as the burgomaster). It is Burton's assertion that he can indeed make something on par with these classics.  Sleepy Hollow for the most part lacks the humor of Burton's earlier ventures.  Atmospherically, however, it is the pinnacle of what he always strives for with his work. The town itself has a brooding maniacal presence to it, steeped in shadow, that serves as constant reminder throughout the whole film that all is not right. The gore is delicious, with a tree full of decapitated heads and blood splashed artfully in the snow.  Christopher Walken is terrifying as the human form of the horseman,Christian Ricci has never looked more beautiful, giving the likes of Barbara Steele and Ingrid Pitt a run for their money, and Johnny Depp, well he does his extraordinary Johnny Depp thing.  This is great stuff. I give it a nine out of ten.",Sleepy Hollow
583,I_Broke_A_Shoelace_This_,"Excellent ""horror"" movie.",10,30 July 2005,"Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci were superb in Sleepy Hollow with Depp adding a discreet, crumbling yet comical spin to Constable Ichabod Crane and Ricci giving her all as the white witch Katrina Van Tassel.Tim Burton has once again proved that he and Johnny Depp work well together and has provided the audience with a delectable delight that is also comical in places.Much to Johnny Depp's disappointment (yet much to the audience's delight) Tim Burton did not run with the idea of Ichabod Crane having the gnarled facial features that the novel suggests but instead finds the beauty in the character and represents it magnificently.However, I did find the effects (especially the ) bordering on disappointing. The did not look real at all and the decapitated head of Magistrate Phillips was clearly that of a dummy and was not as realistic as I would have liked.The gore is relatively tame and I honestly cannot see how it is an effective horror movie.

And this film doesn't make you think that at all. Tim Burton, a very influent director of the modern times, whose curriculum includes ""Batman"", ""Beetlejuice"" and ""Edward Scissorhands"", dares to direct a horror film. Let's review it with a simple equation: Burton + Sleepy Hollow = Great. This film is absolutely great in all aspects. Let's write some of them: a) The dark style (a trade mark of Burton). b) The chilly music by Danny Elfman (a very good friend of Tim and an excellent composer). c) The wonderful photography of Emmanuel Lubezki (amexican like myself, one of the best director of photography). d) The excellent performances of Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci (Burton had already work with them one, with Depp in ""Ed Wood"" and ""Edward...""; with Christina in ""Beetlejuice"").Conclusion.- Three words: excellent, excellent, excellent.",Sleepy Hollow
585,oplusc,The Headless Horseman rides again,9,19 November 1999,"Burton once again displays his amazing knack for atmosphere and makes us all thankful for his penchant for working with Danny Elfman.  SLEEPY HOLLOW is a definite must-see; a classic story with breathtaking special effects. Here, the special effects actually *add* to the story, as opposed to the movie being built around the special effects (Hear that, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2?). Thanks to the unforgettable visuals, nothing at all was changed about the Horseman's killing methods, and it's still far scarier than Freddy or Jason could ever be.  The production design is also to be raved about.  The town of Sleepy Hollow, and the surrounding area are at once familiar enough to call home, but spooky enough to make you want to stay the hell away.

If you are looking for depth and soul-searching, or tormented and deep characters, don't see this movie! Not quite as campy as Clue, this movie delighted that part of me who hates a complicated movie. It is a bit of a who-dun-it mystery, one that if you pay close attention to you can figure out, but you really have to watch, in the way of Mission Impossible. The characters are admittedly two diminsional and the humor admittedly juvenile.  What makes it acceptable is that, with the exception of that misleading trailer we saw tagged to Blair Witch, the film doesn't take itself seriously. It has a cute little beginning, with jokes that made me roll my eyes, and a cute little end (is that a spoiler? I don't think so..), with blood and fainting jokes splattered(no pun intended!) through the middle. Johnny Depp's accent isn't that great; you can't tell if Christina Ricci is even supposed to have one (why would she?) or not.  All in all, I loved it.  I want to take my family back to see it. Not for the small though, bloooooddy. Hey, they knew it wasn't going to win an Oscar when they made it, so why expect it to be that kind of movie.

There are several flashbacks to Ichabod Crain's childhood, and those are shot in a contrasting brighter than life colors.  Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci are magnificant, both greatly complimenting each other. the story flows very easily, and you are involved at each moment the movie runs. You are brought into the mystery of the Headless Horseman, and ultimately a quest to find out just who controls him, and to stop that person.  As soon as you decide that you know who controls him, another surprise.  this happens again and again.  the movie never stops making you think.  and you enjoy every thought.

Like many people, I was a bit dissapointed with Christina Ricci's part in the film, but I still have a lot of confidence in her as an actress.  I saw this movie with my mom, and for more than half of it she was curled up in a little ball in her seat, griping my arm so hard that it lost circulation.  I didn't think it was exactly scary, but that might be because I was busy ooh-ing and aah-ing about all the cool-looking things going on.

591,Pongo-6,Good movie with a great score,6,12 November 1999,"Saw Sleepy Hollow at a press screening last night at Paramount.  In light of the trailer (which I thought was ho-hum), my impression that Burton films generally are overacted and border on cartoonish or comic book-ish, and (especially) the cheesy ""heads will roll"" tagline, I was expecting a pretty mediocre show.  In the end, though, I thought it was good.  There is a little bit of silliness (e.g., head spinning around after being cut off) and one or two too-cartoonish effects (to mention would be to spoil), but overall I think the movie stays away from such things -- which for me is a good thing.  Generally, I think it was well acted too.  My rave for this movie, though, is the Danny Elfman score, which is awesome.  The sound effects were also very good and, as always, Burton does an incredible job of providing a dark and dreary backdrop to a story.  I'm not too sure about some of the character development (or lack thereof), particularly with regard to the characters played by Christina Ricci and Miranda Richardson, but in the end I didn't really mind.",Sleepy Hollow
592,Smile-11,"Impossibly rich, violently gory, and loads of fun.",9,20 November 1999,"""Sleepy Hollow"" is an experience.  It's a love story, a murder mystery, an action-adventure, and film rich with symbols, icons, legends, and superstition.  It's great.The story picks up once Ichabod Crane arrives in dreary, upstate Sleepy Hollow.  Things really get going after Crane's initial exposure to the Horseman's methods and sees the Horseman himself.  It all reaches a glorious crescendo once the mystery begins to unravel and it becomes clear how well-thought-out it all is...It's a movie full of invention and elegance, tempered with vicious violence and inspired performances.  Johnny Depp's ideal performance as Crane is a rock from which the town eccentrics seem that much more interesting.  He portrays what may be the first action hero who faints...more than once!Kudos, also, to Christopher Walken, Christina Ricci, Miranda Richardson(whose character here is NOTHING like the Queen in the British comedy ""BlackAdder II""), and the young actor who plays the surviving son of one of the Horseman's victims.Go see it.  Go see it for the child in you, and go see it for the adult you are.  Romance and magic are not lost notions in our cynical world, for this movie shows us they are alive and well.",Sleepy Hollow
593,recoil-2,A good nights sleep at the cinema..,6,30 January 2000,"I was very disappointed with this film.. it would appear that the films distributors wanted to make as much money as possible from this film, therefore cutting a whole 9 minutes of action from the 18 rated US version and releasing it as a 15 certificate.The story could be concluded in a single line - a headless horseman has been killing people in a place called Sleepy Hollow.. and that was essentially it.  The film wandered around aimlessly trying to entice people with what will happen next, but it was all too obvious and predictable.  There were no surprises, maybe because they were cut from the English version.  The script was poor, and the actors were struggling to deliver to their true potential, partially because there wasn't enough of it to go at.As for directing, Tim Burton did a reasonable job, but I would not go as far as to say as I enjoyed this more than Batman, for example.  The special effects were reasonable and the cutting of heads was nicely done.  Although I'm sure there would have been more horror for if it were not cut itself onto the editors floor.I hope if Tim Burton reads this that he will restore the film to its full length and let it have its 18 Certificate it should have, maybe then I could enjoy it and not fall into a Sleepy Hollow when watching it.6 out of 10.",Sleepy Hollow
594,mike-903,Tim Burton Back on Form,8,11 January 2000,"After the pretty variable Mars Attack, Tim Burton returns to what we know he does best, dark Gothic movies. The cast of Sleepy Hollow includes some actors that have worked with Burton in Johnny Depp, Michael Gough and Jeffrey Jones. Most of the rest of the cast is British. The story is that a number of murders have been taking place in the isolated New York village of Sleepy Hollow. The village think that is the infamous Headless horseman, who was beheaded near to the village, and who was risen from the grave. Constable Icabod Crane is sent to investigate the murder. He initial thinks that it is the work of one of the local offical. But after discovering the horseman at work on night, he finds the evil deeds are at work within the village.It good to see a film that doesn't take itself too seriously. There is lots of black humour, especially from Depp who play Crane as a sort of Early Sherlock Holmes. The sets are beautifully gothic, and darkly and help to draw you into the film. George Lucas take note! The horseman himself is a pretty mean with a sword, as could be expected as he is played by the stuntman who played Darth Maul. The English cast is very good especially Ian McDiarmid, Miranda Richardson and Michael Gambon.To conclude the best film I have seen since the Sixth sense, and miles better than End of Days.",Sleepy Hollow

At the same time it was still an okay movie.The action was good, and the story was so, so, but the music completely ruined the experience. Not only did the music not set the mood right for each scene, but it seamed like the music was not even written for the movie. It just did not match what was happening on screen.I also expected this to be a spooky, maybe even scary movie and was vastly disappointed that not once was I put on the edge of my seat. This was mainly due to the music not setting up the mood, but also certain parts of the movie felt like the story was being rushed along.The final problem I felt was that Burton let the audience know what was going on to early. About the last quarter of the movie was boring since I knew exactly what was going to happen. I could not wait for the movie to end.",Sleepy Hollow

At times it did get pretty borring, but to me it was scarey.  (i get scared pretty easily though)All the headless bodies got a little gruseum though.  Basically it's just like the book, except they show all the chopping parts.  If you're looking for a real scare, skip it. But if you're like me, and just like to be somewhat scared, go. I totally reccomend it then.",Sleepy Hollow

That dismal atmosphere, Danny Elfman's creepy yet lilting score, and fantastic acting make this one of my all-time favorites. I've pretty much grown up along with Christina Ricci and she did a great job as mysterious Katrina.The cinematography and Colleen Atwood's beautiful period costumes were perfect. And a note that you'll never look at Christopher Walken the same way... or seeing Ian McDiarmid as Palpatine, for that matter.",Sleepy Hollow
601,bronco815-2,A Highly Recommended Horror Film,9,17 August 2000,"TITLE: Sleepy HollowRATING: ***1/2 (out of ****)A Review by BroncoWe've probably all read the classic tale ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving. If you're expecting a movie out of that story, look elsewhere. The plot is completely different and the only thing similar are the character's names. But this is definitely not a bad thing because this is a very good movie.Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is an 18th century constable and uses forensic science. So a magistrate (Christopher Lee) sends him to Sleepy Hollow to solve murders where the victims were beheaded. So in Sleepy Hollow, he meets Baltus Van Tessel (Michael Gambon), his wife Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson), the daughter Katrina (Christina Ricci) and a bunch of other people.So they tell him about the headless horseman (Christopher Walken), a hessian who loved to slice people's heads off. At first, Ichabod doesn't believe it until he sees the horseman himself and Ichabod's investigations go a little furthur and he has the help of young Masbath (Marc Pickering) and Katrina. Ichabod also happens to be haunted by visions of his childhood when his mother was killed by his father.This movie is very entertaining and will scare a lot of people. All the performances were done well but I thought Christina Ricci was a little miscast. Don't get me wrong, she did an excellent job but I just thought she was miscast but this is just a minor gripe. The beheadings all look very real and not phony. This is the first film that Tim Burton went full-blown horror and he did an excellent job.This was probably definitely one of the most entertaining films of 1999 (it was definitely the best horror film of 1999). I really enjoyed it, almost everything was done above average. The only major gripe I had was the miscasting of Ricci but that's minor. A very good horror film that horror fans should definitely see if they haven't already.",Sleepy Hollow
602,jasmina-1,Finally something that I can call a scary movie,8,30 July 2001,"Finally something that I can call a scary movie. Starting as a spooky comedy and turning into a real horror, this movie represents a good piece of entertainment not recommended for squeamish people. Tim Burton did a great job presenting the story about the headless horseman with excellent special effects. Combined with good performance by Johnny Depp, playing New Yorker who is brave and determined to find the killer, but in a same time squeamish and disgusted with what he is seeing. The only thing I don't like is that his character is to smart, and he finds resolutions to quickly. But nothing is perfect, so I say this movie is stable 10. I definitely recommend it!",Sleepy Hollow
603,lhj87,Incredible.,10,12 November 2001,"Tim Burton turned a beloved American classic into a masterpiece, which stunned everyone.  To tell you the truth, I personally though it would be a flop until I myself went to see it.  I literally dropped my mouth.  The dialogue was superb and the mood was perfect.  It wasn't a movie to cause you to have an unsettling stomach, rather it saved you from that.  The way the heads were cauterized wouldn't upset you to see, believe me.  I could actually eat my snacks and still keep my eyes glued to the screen.  And shooting it in blue film, how ingenious!  It gave the look something that made it very unique from other films.  I can't sum up how amazing it was in 1,000 words.  So take my word for it, if you love all genres, it's right there in a movie with great acting and delightful filming!  Please see Sleepy Hollow, if you haven't already!",Sleepy Hollow
604,iamOphelia,I love Sleepy Hollow,10,7 April 2002,"This film was excellent. Truly a visual masterpiece, and I must say that the way the colors are handled is ingenious. the film's colors are muted without being too dark- just right to let the red (of blood, or Christina Ricci's lips) stand out. The acting is beautiful, especially Christina and Johnny's. There were some I did not care for- mainly Caspar (wooden) Van Dien- but they get killed off quite satisfactorily. And while it would have been nice to see Johnny and Christina's characters enjoy each other, the prim and proper attitude is much in keeping with the tone of the film and proves that one can still have a good movie with chaste main characters.",Sleepy Hollow

Depp proves, once again that he is the best actor of his generation and maybe one of the best ever.. his versatility is perfectly exposed in this movie, as he gives life to Ichabod Crane.. a character that fills the screen with his light, well reflected in a disturbed young man that manages to gatter an incredible amount of natural charm, using only his naiveness.. As for Tim Burton, he can take you to another world, literally.. the amount of darkness that this man can apply to a picture is, by itself beautifull.. he has a unique way to make everybody look misteryous, especially Depp. The two seem born to work together, just hope they do, much more in the future.

I have watched it probably five times now and every time it seems like I'm watching it for the first time. This film has a halloween themed horror genre to it that is very authentic and original because it is based in the late 1700s and there is no modern distractions in it so you an focus on the thrilling plot and keep and in depth look at the characters, especially the main character Ichabod Crane played by Johnny Depp who does a great job portraying an emotional wreck of a man who happens to be very likable at the same time. Christina Ricci suits the part perfectly of the very beautiful Katrina Van Tassel, the love interest of Johnny Depp's character. This is a great film that should be watched by anyone who likes slightly dark/horror themed where people's heads are cut off haha.",Sleepy Hollow
607,shelkara,Up there with Burton's Best,9,28 December 2007,"I'd say that this, along with Ed Wood, is among Tim Burton's two best films. Okay, along with Batman, among his THREE best films. It can be difficult to winnow down the best of Burton.Johnny Depp is fantastic as Ichabod Crane. He somehow manages to make Ichabod a seamless combination of solemn, mysterious, priggish, brave, fussy, humorous, and gentlemanly. I can't remember if Depp was nominated for any awards, but he definitely should've won a few.The rest of the cast, including Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson, and Michael Gough, among others, is also first rate, with the possible exception of Christina Ricci. She certainly had the right look for the part of Katrina, the ethereally beautiful daughter of the most prominent family in Sleepy Hollow who intrigues Ichabod from first glance, but I found her acting to be a bit wooden. Ultimately that's of little consequence, though. This film had so much more going for it. Another beautiful score by Danny Elfman, a well-paced script, fantastically cartoonish special effects, Halloweenish atmosphere to spare, and a great uncredited psycho turn by Christopher Walken.I enjoy watching this one over and over again, especially 'round All Hallows Eve time.",Sleepy Hollow

Sleepy Hollow is no different. This is one of the very few horror movies that I found enjoyable. I liked pretty much everything about it whether it was the acting, the story, the directing, or the music, it was all great. My favorite thing about this movie is that it doesn't go for stupid jump scares like so many movies in the genre do. Instead of doing that, Burton focused more on making a movie that his audience would enjoy which is very rare when it comes to modern horror movies. Anyone who likes horror movies should see this as well as anyone who is a fan of Tim Burton movies. All and all, this is one of my favorite movies, and definitely my favorite horror movie.",Sleepy Hollow
610,Magistrafamiliae,Burton tried too hard,6,15 November 2004,"Positives: Visually stunning- beautiful scenery and photograpy; unbelievable special effects; well played- for the melodramatic way it was presented; humorous moments along with the scary; and well...it's Johnny Depp!! Negatives: Actually, every not so great moment in the film can be wrapped in the shroud of ""trying too hard"". As a huge fan of suspense, but not gore, I think Burton went way too far trying to shock with gallons of blood instead of brain. Other than the name ""Ichabod Crane"", there is very little in the movie which resembles the original-and far scarier-Washington Irving story. It seemed that the goal of the show was to make the audience go, ""EEWWW!"", instead of hold its breath in fright. I realize some people are into gore...if that is the case then this is one you shouldn't miss. As for me, as a Depp fan- one viewing all the way through was enough. But I do pop in the DVD occasionally and skip through the spewing and squishing to Johnny's clever, sensitive, melodramatic Ichabod. 6.5/10",Sleepy Hollow

I got it with spotless instead of this 21st century.In a say of plot, it was perfect. Everything was relevant to the story. Each characters have done outstanding. In the finishing, it was well ended as every story ends but I desired that in such a way.

612,Macbeth007,Gothic Splendor,8,19 November 1999,"Event movies are hyped and promoted regularly, and, when the film is finally released it often proves to be a big disapointment.  Sleepy Hollow is not such a case.The film is going to be enjoyed greater by those who are Burton fans, like myself, but there is plenty here for even the layman to enjoy.Sleepy Hollow is aboslutely gorgeous, and should definately win an Oscar for cinematography.  The setting is dark and wonderfully Gothic, with that wonderful Burton skewed view we've come to know and love. The fighting scenes are exciting and well done.  The Headless Horsemen is an imposing figure, and Burton continously adds new ways for the ghost to claim his victims.Danny Elfman again provides a remarkable score that is appropriately brooding and moody.  Hardly the bombastic fair of Batman or etheral complacence of Edward Scissorhands, though moments of the score do recall those.The real draw to the film is Johnny Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane. Crane is refreshingly wimpy and not the gung-ho type so common to today's genre films.  Crane is funny and touching and will instantly become an audience favorite.  Christina Ricci is also good in the film, and some of the best moments  are she and Depp's romantic scenes which are peppered with some wonderfully (intentionally) over the top dialogue.To paraphrase Ichabod, I believe there is a bit of witch in this film, for it has bewitched me. ***1/2",Sleepy Hollow
613,tompage,Another Burton Masterpiece,8,14 January 2000,"I have long been a fan of Tim Burton films, being as big a fan of Mars Attacks! as should probably be allowed, but for some reason I wasn't that keen about seeing Sleepy Hollow.It was tremendous. The film had all the Burton tongue-in-cheek charm (the contraptions that Ichabod (Johnny Depp) uses are a personal favourite), but the most outstanding feature was the appearance of the film. The eponymous American village was delightful, and the special effects were never otiose, just perfect for describing the scenes. Christina Ricci was truly beautiful throughout the film, keeping an air of mystery about her character that so many other actresses would have failed to pull off.  Johnny Depp also impressed me  his British character seemed so quaintly over the top in parts, without ever becoming annoying or clichéd. A healthy British cast  Miranda Richardson being particularly strong, backs up this duet.Many have described SH as a modern fairy story, or something of the like, and in some ways that is what Burton does best  the modern creation of fantasy, but to call them fairy stories seems to play down the films as childish. While there is no deeper meaning to Sleepy Hollow, it is a film that no one should feel is below him or her. More Burton, more!",Sleepy Hollow
614,Johnboy-7,Visually stunning,8,2 December 1999,"Despite a surprisingly weak screenplay (even with Tom Stoppard's polishing), Tim Burton's latest is still a triumph through sheer visual panache. This is easily the most sensuously beautiful movie I have seen in a very long time. Certainly the Tree of the Dead is a haunting image, although the Horseman himself becomes less scary as the movie progresses simply because we see so much of him that he becomes more mundane. The ""surprise"" ending is tipped by an obvious bit of casting, but overall this movie is still a vibrant experience, and I can't wait to see those lush images again. The DVD should be a knockout!",Sleepy Hollow
615,bond-jb,"A well-made, entertaining horror film",7,27 November 1999,"Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow is a wonderfully enjoyable film, complete with top-notch acting and first-rate direction. Burton solidifies his position as one of the premiere visual filmmakers in Hollywood. Johnny Depp stars as Ichabod Crane, a constable (in this version, anyway) who is sent up from New York by his frustrated superiors to solve a series of spooky murders.Depp is superb as Crane. He plays the constable not as the generic fast-thinking gun-slinging detective; instead, he paints Crane as an intelligent romantic with a slight touch of cowardice. It's fun to see such a smart, believable performance. Christina Ricci has a nice supporting turn as Katrina Van Tassel, Crane's young love interest. And then there's the always watchable Jeffrey Jones, who, in my mind, will always be known as the principal in Ferris Bueller's Day Off.Burton's use of the camera is masterful. He creates a haunting, eerie mood not seen in a horror movie since Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula in 1992. The dark tone of the cinematography combines well with Danny Elfman's score, producing a remarkably engrossing effect.Sleepy Hollow loses steam late, and its ending, although satisfactory, is not incredible. The screenplay jumps around a little too much, and one character is sort of tossed in at the end and is in need of more development. Unlike the far superior Dracula, which had several excellent supporting roles to beef up the film, Sleepy Hollow is pretty much one-dimensional. But this movie isn't supposed to be a cerebral masterpiece but a visual one, and it certainly is that.",Sleepy Hollow

Too much of the stuff, you would expect from a Burton's film is missing here. The Great Explanation scene in the end is some releif (we finaly get the campy Hack! by Miranda Richardson -- much the Joan Crawford style). And surely Ricchi, acting quite nice at times (What? is SHE to be nice?) is totally out of place. This reminds me of Minnie Driver in An Ideal Husband.

618,Wellvill,FOLLOW THE CHARACTERS!!!,10,22 November 1999,"I've read every submitted review about this movie, and it seems the biggest quarrel everyone has is with the plot, the script, and the monologue near the end... I'm writing this in defense of all three, and hopefully giving everyone some tips on watching this cinematic masterpiece.DO NOT go into this movie thinking you can watch it passively.  It's about as complex as Cris Carter's alien conspiracy from the X-Files.  It may be as brilliant and stunning as Burton's previous movies (of which I DO include Mars Attacks, which I loved), but the line between good and evil isn't as clear-cut and it doesn't have the ""get the bad guy"" plot of his two installments of Batman.  If you quickly forget faces and names, you will get lost with ""Sleepy Hollow"" and may need the near-the-end monologue to rescue you.  If, however, you closely follow the characters and start ACTIVELY watching by trying to piece together the puzzle from the given clues, the monologue takes on a different purpose.  Listen closely to the early dialogues between Ricci and Depp about the townspeople, then watch for the similarities between Depp's flashback scenes and pieces of Ricci's childhood, and the reasoning behind the Horseman's killings should be obvious.  Then comes the monologue... and it will rip to pieces everything you were thinking.  This is sheer brilliance.  This is something of which few writers are capable.  This is the stuff of which Tim Burton movies are made.  This turnaround is what makes movies like ""Sixth Sense"", ""Diabolique"" and ""Se7en"" so good.  However, where those movies turned things around visually, ""Sleepy Hollow"" does it verbally, showing you that while Burton may have some visually stunning effects and sets, he doesn't rely on them to move the movie along.  The monologue turns the movie from what could be a tidy little Hollywood storyline into the realm of the downright twisted.So as for the reviews that dog this movie for having no plot or script, pay no attention to them.  Both elements ARE there if you're truly watching. This kind of subtelty and twisting of events is what makes for good moviemaking, and this movie is the perfect blend of excellent writing and visual effects.  But remember... FOLLOW THE CHARACTERS CLOSELY!!!  Don't forget their relation to the other characters or the story in general, and be sure to soak in EVERYTHING that is said and seen.  If you do, you'll see it is easily the best movie of the year.  10/10 stars! -Eric",Sleepy Hollow
619,Neo-107,A great interpretation of a great classic,8,20 November 1999,"I thoroughly enjoyed this collaboration between Tim Burton, Andrew Kevin Walker and Washington Irving.  Combining such incredible talents as Mr. Burton and Mr. Walker proved quite the appropriate recipe for recreating the Irving classic.  I have read may other comments about this movie and I find it very disturbing that most people either compare it to Star Wars: Phantom Menace or complain that it is too far removed from the original story.For these people I have a few comments.  First, the only connections and comparisons to Star Wars are the actor Ian McDiarmid and the actor/stuntman Ray Park.  Beyond that there is nothing within this movie that comes remotely close to a comparison to Star Wars.  In my opinion this movie was better than that box office behemoth.  If *****had spent as much time on his script for ***, perhaps it would have been as intriguing as Sleepy Hollow.  Next, for those who were not satisfied with the movie's departure from the Irving classic I have but one piece of advice: read the story again.  Washington Irving was masterful at creating scenes and setting atmosphere but The Legend of Sleepy Hollow was a 20 page examination of the little village and the loves of Ichabod Crane (women, food, writings et al) The Horseman, though mentioned a handful of times, did not appear until the last couple pages and then it alluded to the idea that Brom Bones was the culprit, in disguise, to frighten the poor hero Ichabod.There have been other writings and interpretations of the Sleepy Hollow story that focus more on the spectral form of the Headless Horseman.  I believe this movie was done in the spirit of those other works and is among the best.  It brings to life the setting of this little valley and attempts to recreate the feeling that Washington Irving described best in his story. It was indicated that Sleepy Hollow was a magical and dream like place, thus the name ""Sleepy Hollow.""  In this little upstate valley the strangest things occur and such ghosts and goblins roam freely if only in the mind of the inhabitants.  Tim Burton manages to capture that sensation and allows the audience to feel as if they stepped not into a theater, but another world.Andrew Kevin Walker's workup and translation of the story also makes for a compelling movie.  Allowing the changes for the movie adaptation were a sign of genius.  Displacing the hero and introducing him to the Sleepy Hollow atmosphere along with the audience, enhanced the experience.  Giving a clear background for the Horseman, which is only briefly provided in the original story, was also an improvement to the movie's story.  Let's face it, if they had made a 105 minute movie that tried to replicate the original short story there would have been whole theaters full of ""sleepy"" patrons.The acting was also superb giving a hand to Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci for fabulous performances.  As for the rest of the cast?  Fantastic.  To see all of these wonderful actors in secondary roles was a treat.  Starting with Christopher Lee as the chief magistrate in New York; Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough, Ian McDiarmid, Michael Gambon, Miranda Richardson and even Casper Van Dien all did magnificent work.Though the story lagged at moments, they were few and far between.  The editing in the beginning was a bit choppy but ran more fluently after the 20-30 minute point.  An excellent adaptation of a great story.  This was definitely a movie that Burton was born to make.",Sleepy Hollow

I chose to see this film over Stigmata on the basis of the 1 point advantage.The beauty of Christina Ricci & the surprisingly good performance by Johnny Depp could not save this film.  It becomes more and more like a tacky 'whodunnit' as the film goes on and to top it off the plot is such a mess that the unmasked villain has to explain to the audience what the film was about.I will be glad if I can spare one person from going to see this film - only check it out if it's the last film in the video shop.

621,hitch99,Burton's best-looking film,7,21 November 1999,"Dark, stylish, disturbing. Tim Burton lives to make movies according to these adjectives. However, Sleepy Hollow seems to be his masterpiece. The legend surrounding the Headless Horseman is the perfect tale for Burton's oddball, surreal direction. As with all his films, the setting is an indispensable character. Whether it's the Gothic underworld of Gotham City or the pastel-colored, surbubia found in Edward Scissorhands; Burton creates a world that lingers in the mind of viewers long after the film is over.Longtime Burton collaborator Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci shine as Constable Ichabod Crane and Katrina Van Tessel, even while delivering dated, kitschy lines. However, Depp's perfomance is an ingenious blend of childishness and stoicism, of comedy and terror that shines and fits Burton's puerile nightmare perfectly. In a movie that stretches from Batman's cartoon-like violence to scenes of decapitation, animal mutilation and medieval torture, by far Burton's darkest, there is still a sense of mystical fantasy of childlike wonder which keeps even the most horrific scenes from becoming too offensive.The only negative criticism I have to offer about this movie is some of the cornball dialogue uttered by the main characters, and the contrived story that seems to fall together all too quickly at the end. It's as though Burton tries his hand at a Hercule Poirot mystery without letting the audience in on it. Thus, the conclusion seems to come and go without stopping to be understood.However, if nothing else, the profound production design is more than worth the price of admission and is guaranteed to hold you prisoner under its hypnotic spell. 7.5/10",Sleepy Hollow

623,blackcoffee,"like Coppola's 'Dracula', you're cheering for both sides, good and evil",8,1 December 1999,"Not since Coppola's presentation of Brahm Stoker's Dracula has horror been delivered so ingeniously.  This film reeks of Burton's dark, gothic, anti-pastel-colors style of scenery.  Death looms everywhere in scenery with fog, autumn leaves, cemetaries, dead-dry trees and we are supposed to believe that a supernatural entity, the horseman, is able to roam the earth amidst a industrial-dawning society.  The industrial-age elements consisting of the smoke stacks in New York, the windmill, Ichabod's satchel and his forensics, etc...  The horror is delivered in majestic, triumphant grandeure and not cheezy, grab-atcha gore.  The grey setting acts as a perfect contrasting canvas, or an amplifier for the bloody scenes which would never make us cringe so nearly as much if we were watching Friday the 13th part Y2K.",Sleepy Hollow
624,mjr_8,Already Overrated,5,22 November 1999,"Although the film has many positive points including of course the amazing production design, cinematography, and Mr. Depp's fine performance; it is marred by Tim Burton's lack of storytelling ability and serious script problems. Although I am a fan of Mr. Burton's film style, I cannot stress enough how constantly disappointed I am with his inability to create compelling and moving films. As he excels at the visual arts, Burton lacks the talent to create films that move you in the slightest way. Sleepy Hollow, as well as many of his other films, does not leave the viewer with a feeling of anything throughout its proceeding as well as after the film is over. Literally, it is washed from your palette as soon as you leave the theater. Completely forgettable. The film does not amply supply scares, excitement, humor, romance, drama, surprises, any emotion. A good film does not need all of the previous characteristics but it should provide at least one in good supply or a clever balancing of many. Sleepy Hollow is not boring but never is it actually interesting. The Disney cartoon made many years ago was more compelling. Mr. Burton is no doubt a very talented visionary but he does not move his viewers. I like movies that compel me to watch them a second time, Sleepy Hollow makes me sad that I even watched it once. 5 out of 10. PS- Ms. Ricci's acting severely lacked something to be desired.",Sleepy Hollow
625,HouTex,Did I see the same movie y'all did?,3,27 November 1999,"I thought this movie was full of clunky dialogue and bad acting. The scene of Ichabod ""deducing"" up in his attic room was a hoot.

Or was it?",Sleepy Hollow
626,Criz-3,Halloween is obviously Burton's favorite holiday!,9,8 December 1999,"Tim Burton delivers a truly frightening example of what the Legend of Sleepy Hollow looks like when done right.  The voyage of Ichabod Crane from New York to Sleepy Hollow descends the audience into a setting which is the very definition of the word ""Spooky"".  We are kept, just one step behind Ichabod as he delves head-first into the terrible mystery of the Headless Horseman. Burton's characteristic vision transitions between an almost comic-book atmosphere at times and an old world setting so deep one can almost smell the mud and fresh-cut hay.  His scenes use this ambiance to center on the the characters and the story rather than provide the audience with pretty view.  A great deal of credit must go to Art Direction and Production design. Johnny Depp plays true to Ichabod's character, allowing the shortcomings and nailing the distinctiveness that makes this rendering of Sleepy Hollow so appealing.  Christina Ricci makes her complicated role aloof and seductive. A notable entrance by newcomer Marc Pickering as he plays Young Masbath - this boy did such good work I wonder if his role was expanded during filming.  This is what child-actors should model!  Christopher Walken and Ray Park team up to bring an evil, determined, monster to life in the form of the greatest Headless Horseman to grace the silver screen. A disappointing performance by Starship-Trooper-alum Casper Van Dien and the difficulty of following the names of characters in the film distract from a few key sequences, but they do little damage to a work that is obviously created by people VERY excited about it.This is the definitive Legend of Sleepy Hollow.",Sleepy Hollow
627,Sanae,I had my eyes closed for much of it...(Spoilers?),9,29 November 1999,"Although I have a slight aversion to blood and gore, I had to go to this movie after seeing the previews.  I would recommend it to anyone, even those with weak stomachs.  (SPOILER) Most of the time it's easy enough to tell when the Horseman is coming since he has a few trademark sound effects (hoofbeats, sword-sound).Besides that, I honestly enjoyed this movie.  The atmosphere is great, and if you're not too jaded it's pretty easy to get sucked into it.  Johnny Depp is fabulous, his facial expressions are the highlight of the movie.  And what a face!  He's really a good actor, and that's coming from a person who's never really seen too much of him before.  Likewise, I'm not a Tim Burton fan, but I think that he did well with this.  Some of the dialogue was kind of clunky, but it added to the atmosphere.  I really can't comment on too many of the other actors; they kind of faded into the background for me, and I thought most performances paled next to Mr. Depp's.  I couldn't even remember most of the other character's names.Really, this movie is more funny then it is scary or suspenseful.  It's a good one to see with your friends, you'll find yourself laughing a lot more. It does have some scary moments too, but nothing that anyone old enough to get in with the R rating couldn't handle.I'd like to mention that I've never seen the Disney version, or read the original. You might be better off if you see it that way, since it's a lot easier to see it as an original story, and not notice all the things that were changed.  If I had known any of the original versions, my review would probably be quite different.Overall, a pretty good movie with a spectacular performance from Johnny Depp.  Try and see it if you can, but don't kick yourself if you don't get the chance.",Sleepy Hollow

The movie is crafted as clinically as the Headless Horseman's precision in decapitations and with such aplomb. Thud !The casting is perfect from the New York flatfoot, Johnny Depp to the cameo role of the Horseman's early victim, Martin Landau. Set in 1799, nice millennial touch, New York and New England are fantastically portrayed. And the woods of Sleepy Hollow are not the kind of place where anyone would want to go for a picnic.So who or what is the Headless Horseman, who will be the next victim, what is the conspiracy, can the Horseman be stopped ?

I liked how Burton incorporated his own touch in the first scene..where VanGarett ran into the corn field and turned around and saw the scare crow with the pumpkin head...The pumpkin head face design looked very similar to Burton's character in ""The Nightmare before Christmas.""

All the so called horror movies have had basicly no story, and bad teenage caracters who really suck at acting. OK, watching one or two of them might be ok but after a while they are all the same. So as I walked around the video store I looked at movie after movie but there was nothing that really appealed to me. But then on the top shelf there was Sleepy Hollow, it looked different from all the other horror movies so i hired it. That Day I sat doun to watch it and it keept me intrigued the whole movie. Even though it probley wasnt the most realistic movie, I didnt laugh or comment onece that there was somthing stupid or unrealistic about this movie. Thats because the movie was so wel l made that it made you belive that there could be a headless horseman for that houre and a half when you watch this movieWell any way the movie starts of when Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) is sent to Sleepy hollow to investigate three murders that have occurred over the last fortnight all three victoms were decapitated. When he gets there more people get decapitated and the people in the toun belive it is the headless horseman. But Constable Ichabod Crane dose not belive them untill he sees the horseman with his own eyes. Now with the help of Katrina Anne Van Tassel (Christina Ricci) and Young Masbath (Marc Pickering) he must find out who controls the headless horseman and in what significant order the horsman is killing in!You may ask me why I think this is the best horror movie ever, well because it has a great story line, its got great actors and its the most intriguing horror movie I have seen.

It's about a person that does not believe in ghosts comes in a situation where there are ghosts. What makes me angry about this movie is how a great setting (the spooky forests of main?) and story are being used for a cheap horror flick. It is the same as if a criminal story about a murder in a locked room is solved by having a murderer that uses deathrays through the wall. The movie always takes the easy way. It seems as if the filmmakers ran out of ideas how to solve their problems and just went for the ghost that can do whatever it pleases.,Sleepy Hollow

Yeah, your father got killed and you're just mildly scared, as a bonus you're allowed to faint...Also, at the end, this witchy blondie tells the whole story but for whom? For the girl that's going to be beheaded - just in case, if someone in the after-life asked her why she's dead, she should have a fancy story to tell.The only way this movie doesn't seem stupid and absurd to me is when I skim through the scenes - this way the ridiculous general image is kind of skipped.

He is of course an amazing actor and he proves that dramatically in this performance, being the inspector on the case of the brutel head decaportations, not believing in ghosts or any sort of spirit, scared of spiders and has a tendency to faint a lot, i think he pulls it off well!

Wrong. Despite how I rate it, this film is entirely watchable...maybe even two or three times compared to some other films out there. But, to me, it falls short on several fronts.First, I'm a big-time reader and I thoroughly enjoyed Washington Irving's short story, ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow."" So I was disappointed in that this film made more or less no attempt whatsoever to follow that story. In Irving's story, Ichabod Crane moves to the area and is a school teacher. In this movie, he is a constable sent from New York to investigate three murders by decapitation.Second, part of the allure of the short story is Crane's infatuation with Katrina Van Tassel and the friction this causes between him and Katrina's would-be lover ""Brom Bones"" (Abraham van Brunt). The story alludes to the fact that perhaps the headless horseman is indeed Brom Bones scaring Crane (the Disney cartoon actually hints at this as well); the movie allows no such character interplay.Third, the whole point of this movie seems to be the mindless decapitation of people. And there is a lot of it. A LOT. Men, women, and one child (though the child's decapitation takes place, thankfully, off-screen). And it is gory. Not a whole lot of blood, but plenty of flesh. If you're squeamish at all, that's a good enough reason to avoid this film.Fourth, the evil character's recitation of motivation (a staple among Saturday morning cartoons from 20 years ago, but grossly out of place in a 21st Century movie) at the film's end is drivel. It could have been shortened, ""figured out,"" and almost entirely left out -- although it did allow for one more beheading on camera. Whopee.Fifth, the script (and acting) is pretty poor. Now, I like Johnny Depp (Edward Scissorhands, Pirates of the Caribbean, etc.) and I think the guy is great at playing unusual characters, but his performance here reminds me of an Al Gore speech. Because he's done so much so well, I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and just blame the script. In fact, you can pretty much blame the script for the whole movie.Not all is bad in this film. The swordplay by the horseman is excellent. The special effects are pretty well done (some are meant to make you laugh, but just come across as cheesy). And there is the neat bow-tie at the end as the villain gets it and the good guy goes home happy. Again, it's entirely watchable, just not that good.",Sleepy Hollow

I mean, if I'm not mistaken in the good old days horror films were about imagery getting a feeling that there might be something lurking sinisterly in the woods. But unfortunately that sort of aesthetic has been forgotten. That was until Tim Burton came along. I know many people are fed up with everyone gabbing on about him, but really the guy deserves it. You can tell this was made by a fan of genuine old-school horror flicks, whilst also taking advantage of decensored movies have become since then. The plot takes some nice twists and turns and the whole cast are superb, most note-worthy of course is Johnny Depp with his portrayal of Ichabod Crane. Most actors would play him as a strong-silent type, Depp on the other hand, thanks to his lack of vanity, plays him interestingly and almost cartoonish.

Visually, Sleepy Hollow is a masterpiece. Tim Burton uses his classic style of contrasting light from dark. Using light make up around the faces and dark around the eyes, a la Edward Scissorhands. The horseman's body actors (Rob Inch, Ray Park) are excellent, giving this spirit human-like qualities.

650,Flik,"Heads, A Hero, Humor, and Mystery--10 out of 10--Fantastic FUN! (No spoilers!)",10,20 November 1999,"I've been looking forward to this film since first seeing the teaser trailer months ago, and I was in no way disappointed.  The movie pulls off a lot that many other films reach for and don't quite grasp.
The characters were actually developed and 3-D for this kind of film--particularly Ichabod himself--which I didn't expect given the nature of the story.  The acting is superb and FUN!  Johnny Depp puts in a performance that I've read he was worried would be taken badly, going over the top as often as it does--but he nails it dead on, creating a great combination of personality strengths and flaws, seriousness and humor, for the hero.  Christina Ricci does a great job as Katrina, also (I'd say more about that, but it would add spoilers).  The town ""fathers"", so to speak, are the best little set of talented character actors you could ask for, so that even the smaller roles are acted well.I really didn't expect as much HUMOR in this film, either--and as I'm one of those who is often one of the only ones laughing at select movies, let me add that there were about 3 or 4 empty seats spaced far apart in the whole theatre, and the rest of the audience was laughing right along with me.
The special effects and atmosphere were, of course, flawless, and the action sequences were exciting and well-executed (if you'll pardon the pun). Recreation of the time period and location, and the look and mood of everything was beautiful, as I expected from the artistry of Tim Burton. And how can you go wrong with Darth Maul heading up your action sequences? (Okay, don't pardon that one.) Another nice thing about the action was the fast pace of such sequences--none of this drag-the-time-out for a closeup of everything that's going on, audience-demeaning, intelligence-underestimating sort of thing.  No, if you blink, if you're playing with your popcorn, if you're not paying attention, you just miss it.The same goes for the information that'll let you play detective along with Ichabod, if you want.  That leads me to the last amazing thing I'm going to rant about here--the fact that this was actually a well-written, nicely-plotted detective story.  Many a more mainstream movie fails at putting together a good figure it out or be surprised (or a little of both, all depending on the type of moviegoer you are) MYSTERY.  My significant other has great fun in trying to figure things out ahead of time as the plot unfolds, I don't and choose not to, and we both loved it, and found it filled with unexpected and unpredictable developments.That's it, basically.  I loved it, go see it if you want to see a perfectly-executed & fun supernatural mystery (as long as you don't mind decapitations and blood!), and I hope that you're as entertained as I was, and as I'm going to be when I go see it again!  :)",Sleepy Hollow

The acting is above average, Johnny Depp version of a young, scientific constable fighting for a fair justice, based on facts instead of torture is convincing. The villagers look as you would expect them - few handsome people, most look really awful - and the village don't look like Hollywood at all.The special effects are really great - the headless horseman is really convincing. But they are a little to graphic, too much blood and shocker scenes. The movie surely does not need so much gore.If you are not afraid of seeing dead bodies and blood, look this movie.

His creative adaptations to Irving's original story only bolster an already engaging storyline.  Depp marvelously maintains Ichabod's nerdy but endearing personality while representing a turn-of-the-century detective instead of a schoolteacher as in Irving's original. Also, the peripheral characters added great chemistry and dynamics to the movie instead of subtracting from it.  The Masbeth son was a perfect partnering sleuth to Crane's often frail portrayal of courage and fortitude.If ample amounts of blood and Freudian symbolism do not offend you, ""Sleepy Hollow"" definitely entertains with a remarkably creative display of balance between both the power and sometimes impotent use of reason to uncover and explain truth.

655,Ebb-3,"A little goofy, but good.",8,9 December 1999,"I thought the character of Ichabod Crane (along with the actions of some of the other characters) was a little goofy.  I was expecting something a little more gritty and horror based.  The scenery was excellent and gave the movie a good creepy feel.  Christina Ricci was wonderful (as she always is). Not having read the story I can't say how well it followed it, but it was a good movie in itself.",Sleepy Hollow
656,xeno000,A gorgeous and dreamy spectacle,10,19 November 1999,"Tim Burton has delivered yet another beautiful, frightening gothic masterpiece in ""Sleepy Hollow."" This movie surpasses the ""Batman"" movies in the depth of melancholy and stylish gloom it embodies. That is not to say that this is a completely dark film - far from it. But it is suffused with the aching loneliness and utter sense of alienation embodied in the character of Ichabod Crane. Johnny Depp's beauty is used to convey the absolute fragility of the character. Crane's journey from terror to resolution and finally bravery in the face of a seemingly unstoppable foe is portrayed both starkly and with a touch of sensitivity as well. I disagree with those critics who saw the portrayal of Crane's childhood trauma as a distraction. Those scenes showed exactly why Crane became the man he was, and why he approached the situation he found in Sleepy Hollow as he did. Life often takes us to places that force us to confront all of the traumas and inner demons we would prefer to leave buried. In ""Sleepy Hollow's"" dream-like images, we are taken through one man's harrowing attempt to face all that he fears -- death, loss, pain, the unknown and fear itself -- in order to emerge more whole than before. Depp played Crane as a ""frightened schoolgirl"" for a very good reason; Crane wilfully halted and repressed his emotional growth at an extremely young age and attempted to supplant that side of himself with intellectual pursuits. When events dredged up hidden memories of past horrors from his unconscious, his emotional reactions were those of a child. Christina Ricci's character serves as the perfect counterbalance to Crane, very emotionally aware, yet also strong enough to face the horrors around her. The film is a beautifully-wrought vision of a man attempting first to avoid, then to accept and defeat, the irrational side of human nature. It was pure joy to watch.",Sleepy Hollow
657,uyafp,"Different, But Good",9,19 November 1999,"Anyone who goes to see this movie with the idea that it's going to be just like the original story is in for a surprise, but not a bad one, as far as I'm concerned.  It's got the same basic story, but several added dimensions that I believe really benefit the film.  Some people may be mad about these changes, but honestly, what's the point of seeing the exact same story over and over again? It was really well made, and there are a lot of exciting scenes and an engaging mystery plot.  I recommend it (to anyone over 13).",Sleepy Hollow
658,Gallston,Gothic thrills with beautiful scenery and fine acting,9,18 January 2000,"I have always liked Tim Burton's movies and this film didn't make an exception. From the very beginning I was stunned by the beautiful scenery and gothic surroundings along with a near perfect camera handling. This movie is a fine example how to make a simple story interesting using suspense and adding clever little twists into the plot. Crane's dream sequences are astounding, colorful thrills themselves. Good acting, beautiful images and great acting. One of the best movies I have seen this millennium this far :)",Sleepy Hollow
659,Skip-58,A huge disappointment,2,23 November 1999,"This movie was bad from start to finish.The plot, which was weak at best, did not begin to unfold until halfway through the film. Once the plot did start to unravel, it consumed the entire movie, and seemed to intentionally confuse the audience without good reason.The film was much too dark. When the audience isn't straining their eyes to get a look at the characters on the screen, they are wincing from the consistently annoying lightning flashes throughout.An entirely uninteresting film.",Sleepy Hollow
660,Mickey81,Excellent,8,20 November 1999,"Sleepy Hollow is a near masterpiece.  The way it is shot, with the sun never peeking its head through the clouds, and acted, with great performances by Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci, is fabulous.  If you have an appreciation for the artistic value of movies, and if you don't mind a little terror and gore, definitely check out this movie.  Preferably with someone who won't mind if you grab onto them at some of the more terrifying scenes.",Sleepy Hollow

662,Lelio-5,"Once again, Burton takes adults on a journey into a magical, mystic world.",10,19 November 1999,"Sleepy Hollow, directed by Tim Burton, is a wonderfully imaginative take on the American tale.Using saturated colors, whitened skin tones, and a lot of fog, Burton successfully transports the viewer in to the magical realm where fairy tales live and legends are born.  Emulating Hammer Horror Films of past, Burton stretches our reality.  As a director, he is free and bold.  Always making the unexpected seem ordinary and the ordinary seem like magic.  Using 1899 New York as a template and the world on the brink of scientific revolution as a moving plot force, Burton further endears the American tale... only this time we get transported into the world of Icabod and his eccentricities.  The fog laden woods full of crooked, dead trees give a nightmare-ish quality to the atmosphere.  Surprisingly graphic decapitations, and rolling heads are sure to get the hair to rise on your neck.The screenplay, written by Andrew Kevin Walker, of SeVen Fame, is solid in structure and imaginative in dialogue.  It feels like dialogue from the darkest parts of a Dicken's novel.  The mixture of science and mysticism is balances masterfully.  Character's motivations are strong and carefully crafted, including even the smallest of character rolls.  In short, the work is as solid as Walker's past screenplays which only make us yearn for more.Performances are superb, especially Johnny Depp, who makes Icabod frail yet curious.  Supporting characters are interesting and full of history and background.This holiday movie is sure to please many, and makes this film lover anxious for our next adventure with Burton. 10/10",Sleepy Hollow
663,Necro56-3,The best film I have seen this year!!!,9,20 November 1999,"I was anticipating ""Sleepy Hollow"" ever since I first saw the trailer for it with ""The Mummy"".  Now I am back to say that it is the best movie I have seen this year!  Now I have not seen all the movies this year, such as American Beauty or Three Kings, but I can say that this is the best one that I have seen.  I was hooked from the very first scene to the very last scene and everything in between.  The set design is stunning!  I found the story to be very well done as well. If you think you know this story, think again, it is totally different from the original version.  I also thought that the romance between Ichabod and Katrina was a nice addition to the story. I am giving the movie a score of a 9, but that does not mean it is as important a film as say ""American Beauty"", but on an action/horror level, the film is great. A must see!!!!",Sleepy Hollow
664,Dodg,Just a good flick.,9,20 November 1999,"I just saw Sleepy Hollow last night and I have to say, it was not what I expected but, it was great nonetheless. It was far less scary than I thought it would be, all the beheading scenes being quite funny. Tim Burton did a wonderful job, it really is a feast for your eyes. Christina Ricci was not so good, at least thats what I thought. It seemed like she couldn't shake her 1990sness, because she speaks just like most of her other characters. That leaves Johnny Depp. How cool is this guy? He rocks as usual. A good movie.",Sleepy Hollow
665,mattzo2,Depp and Burton set new standards for horror films,10,21 November 1999,"Burton's creepy atmosphere and Depps' brilliant portrayal of the cowardly Crane make this film more than just a horror flick. The characters - I include the setting as one of them - create such an enthralling world that the audience can't help being drawn in. Depp's character is so original and so masterfully done that although we all know ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" we hope that he will somehow escape the fate that Ichabod Crane is to suffer as in Irving's tale. Yes, this movie has gore and we know where it is headed, but the leaf-strewn path is worth traveling.",Sleepy Hollow
666,vermifuge,The epitome of darkness which is TIM BURTON,10,24 November 1999,"I believe that Tim Burton has once again hit the jackpot. With his surreal darkness and ultimate gloomy M.O. for his movies, Sleepy Hollow was destined to be told through his eyes. It's just one of those stories that are made for him, like Brandon Lee and The Crow, it was if he was born to play the title character. Seriously though, I was more that just entertained with leepy Hollow, I was captivated. Not only because of Burton finally going the whole 9 yards into the domain of R-ratings, but because of the atmosphere he creates everso elequently. The movie had NO color what so ever, it was merely shades of grey and black. Even the blondes (i.e. Christina Ricci) in the movie looked more like white. The fact that the movie had no rays of sunshine, just a coating of dark grey clouds that forever was the scenery for the movie put a smile on my face. This was my kinda movie. Johnny Depp portraying a quirky character, and all the other Tim Burton veterans as well, Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough, and Martin Landau (did you catch him at the start?) all feed right into the story line, playing the all-knowing-too-much town elders, with the looks on their face that just makes you quiver with interest to what they may know. This isn't much of review, but more of a praise to Tim Burton.  All I'm saying is that I'm not naive, but I gave this movie a 10 just like the 121 other voters before me who I'm sure know what they are voting about, an impecable motion picture that shall remain forever one of my favorite films.",Sleepy Hollow
667,slbf1,Heads certainly did roll......,10,28 November 1999,"Tim Burton has knocked this one clean out of the park!  The Horseman was an awesome spectacle of gothic horror, Johnny Depp was hilarious, and the visuals to this movie were absolutely breathtaking!  Depp and Burton are perfect together!  Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands, and now Sleepy Hollow prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that this duo is amazing together!  See it a couple of times!  There are, just for curiosity's sake, 12 decapitations shown in full gore and 4 off screen, one guy gets sliced in half and a bat gets its head chopped off.",Sleepy Hollow
668,20th Century Vixen,Top stuff...,10,3 February 2000,"I must say, I was absolutely gagging to see this film. I had heard so many bad reviews for it, and with this being a Tim Burton film, I got me wondering how a fabulous director like him could have got something wrong. So I went to see it with an open mind. The first thing I must comment on, is whether you liked the film or not, I'm sure no-one could have failed to like the look of the whole thing. The film should certainly win an award for best cinematography because every single frame was beautifully composed. The atmosphere was brilliant, and it definitely had the name 'Tim Burton' written all over it. I must give top marks to Johnny Depp for the portrayal of his character. It was not always convincing, but he really threw himself into his role, and carried it off well. Not too sure about Christina Ricci, though, maybe it was because we did not see very much of her, but I didn't find her very believable. Unfortunately, to me, she is still Wednesday Addams, but I hope to catch up on her most recent films, because I know that she is a fine actress. I have to hand it to her, though, she looked stunning in 'Sleepy Hollow.' One final critism. I don't know what everybody else thought, but I didn't sense any electricity between Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. If this film was to be a romance, then I think more should have been made of their relationship.Anyway, criticisms aside, I thought that 'Sleepy Hollow' definitely sparkled with polish, and it has obviously been carefully crafted. All I can say now is that I can't wait until it comes out on video!!!!!",Sleepy Hollow
669,mwzeininger,It's a good one!,9,23 November 1999,"Well, I finally got to see ""Sleepy Hollow"" after being so excited to see it for so long, and I wasn't disappointed.  Okay, so I figured I was going to get scared, and I wasn't, but it was still a ton of fun and very exciting. And how about those crazy decapitations?!  Tim Burton is an amazing visual storyteller, and this movie is perfect for him.  Nobody could do Sleepy Hollow better than him, and Johnny Depp was just great.  This is going to have to become a Thanksgiving tradition!  What a good time at the movies.",Sleepy Hollow
670,mcdonough32,As good as I thought it would be!!!!,10,30 November 1999,"First of all, I've been waiting for this movie since the first trailer came out in July. And when I saw the banners say Tim Burton film, starring Johnny Depp, and music by Danny Elfman, I knew this would be worth waiting for. Obviously, I saw it on opening day, and was in anticipation until the Paramount sign came on. When it was all over, I thought it was great!! The acting by all the cast, especially Johnny Depp, were great. Another obvious remark, but Danny Elfman's music was superb. In >fact, I bought the sound track before I saw the movie. The special effects were very realistic. The decapitations were gruesome, but awesome! And of course, the directing by Tim Burton was all I thought it'd be, and this movie will become a classic for sure. However, there is one complaint. You'll probably disagree with me, but this movie COULD HAVE BEEN PG-13. There were bloody, and gore-filled scenes, but it was almost in a kiddie kind of violence. Except for one part that was unnecssary, but it wasn't disturbing.",Sleepy Hollow

The Legend of Sleepy Hollow (the story) always scared me as a child, but the disney movie never did a thing for me.  However, this film terrified me.  People in the theater were actually screaming.  This is also one of the most visually stunning films I have ever seen.  If there's no oscar nod for art direction, it will be criminal.",Sleepy Hollow
672,smgfan1399,BURTON DOES IT AGAIN!,9,4 December 1999,"Sleepy Hollow rocked!  I think that Christina Ricci did a wonderful job as Katrina Van Tassel.  I also think that Johnny Deep made a good constible Crane, but his character was kind of a scardy cat so to speak (but I guess that it's important to stick to Washington Irving's tale as well as possible).  All in all I think that Sleepy Hollow deserves at least a 9 for a rating!",Sleepy Hollow

My best friend, however, is not scared of any movies or haunted houses.  So, obviously, she tries to get me to do something scary about once a month.  And this month, it was a scary movie.  She had tried to get me to watch Carrie a while back and, of course, I chickened out.  Now, the only scary movies I'd seen before Sleepy Hollow were Scream 2 and I Still Know What You Did Last Summer.  So believe me I was a bit skeptical when I walked into the theater Thursday night.  But whatever small amounts of enthusiasm for horror flicks I had obtained through haunted houses and cheap horror flicks were greatly increased when I saw Sleepy Hollow.  It was everything a scary movie should be, and more.  So to all my fellow skeptics out there, this one will restore your faith in horror movies.",Sleepy Hollow

The sword fighting was very well done, a nice surprise.The script however was a little weak, though the story itself is excellent. What really let it down those was the over acting; only Depp could get away with it.Overall a great film, and probably Burton's best to date.",Sleepy Hollow
677,Lucky Strike,Thoroughly enjoyable,10,13 January 2000,"Tim Burton has again proved his worth with a masterpiece of gothic horror. The whole way the film is made is excellent, from the way the special effects are used to enhance the story, rather than sell the movie, to the superb acting of the entire cast. I must confess I was a little reluctant at first to see Johnny Depp in the lead role, but from the outset my mind was changed as he threw himself enthusiastically into the part with exactly the right mix of assumed self confidence tempered by a realistic portrayal of a man hopelessly out of his depth in the situation in which he finds himself.The story, the sets, the special effects and most of all the cast and director make this a film well worth seeing, definately the best thing out of Hollywood in a very long time. Other directors take note..it's not how big the budget, it's what you do with it. A turkey stuffed with gold is still a turkey, but this film is pure gold, without a hint of poultry.Why are you still here? Go and see this film immediately.",Sleepy Hollow
678,Tithers,Highly atmospheric,9,19 January 2000,"...then again, atmosphere itself doesn't make a great film - but together with some fantastic set designs, unintrusive (but incredibly effective) music by Danny Elfman, Christopher Walken being as cool as usual, although the amount of time he's on screen is considerably smaller than we had been led to believe by all the publicity, Christina Ricci's eyes.......er....sorry, getting carried away. Anyway - I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and will definitely try and see it again, even if it's just to fathom out precisely what accent Johnny Depp is supposed to have.",Sleepy Hollow
679,thegin,"Strangely comical, yet still an excellent film.",10,25 January 2000,"Any reservations that I had about the film being be a turkey, were almost immediately quelled upon seeing the movie. From the offset Mr. Depp throws himself into the role of Icabod Crane with enthusiasm and gusto; portraying excellently a man of ""science"" suddenly out of his depth in legend. Christina Ricci also plays the role of Katrina van Tassel superbly; a sure sign of good things to come from this talented young actress.I would be reluctant to call this film an outright horror film - the special effects are used primarily to enhance the plot and visual appearence, and the gore level is low. The visual detail is a masterpiece - the sets are fantastic and lighting brilliant. Tim Burton has superbly used music and suspense to build the thrill in the film. However, the comical interjections provide the required break-up of the suspense.All in all a very well put together film, with solidly good acting, and most of all a superb plot. Well worth seeing!",Sleepy Hollow
680,simbalk726,Burton's Best--Stunning!,10,26 May 2000,"When you see Sleepy Hollow, it's quite apparent that this is a Tim Burton film. It is visually stunning, with each detail in the frame carefully seen to. While the plot differs dramatically with Irving's original story, I personally like this version better. While Christina Ricci brings a fresh, cool take on Katrina Van Tassel, her performance can be slightly flat at times. However, I don't feel this detracts from the film at all. The true jewel in this movie is Johnny Depp. His fine performance as the slightly cowardly-yet-intelligent Ichabod Crane drives the film, bringing a complexity and real-worldness to the character. Ichabod is not your typical action hero facing down a bloodthirsty ghost--what other movie hero do you know that responds to danger by pulling the nearest child in front of him for protection, or jumps onto a chair at the mere sight of a spider? Depp pulls this off marvelously, and his facial expressions masterfully convey terror, queasiness, embarrassment, and confusion throughout the film. Mr. Depp should be proud of his performance. Sleepy Hollow is a film I highly recommend; Depp makes up for weaknesses in Ricci's acting and the plot line, as well as the weaknesses in the character of Lady Van Tassel (Miranda Richardson). In short, see this film--Burton, Depp, and the film's composer, Danny Elfman, deserve high praise for their work on it. I highly recommend the soundtrack as well--it is Elfman's best!",Sleepy Hollow
681,gannon700,"A scary, darkly funny, and over-all beautiful film masterpiece.",9,12 June 2001,"This move is my favorite. Director Tim Burton captures us once again in a thrilling masterpice of sight, sound, and atmosphere.       
It has wrongly been named a simple run-of-the-mill horror film. It posseses the elements of many ganeras, not just horror, but romance, suspence, fantasy, mystery, and even action! The film was macabre and funny simultaniously at times, giving it a dark humor (what Tim Burton film does'nt?). Sure Cristina Ricci could have done with a bit more feeling, and at certain times Jhonny Depp should have been a little more convincing, but give them the credit.   It was not easy doing this horror film for them. I have read the original story-board, and I found it astounding how many things so alike! I MAY give away some things, so if you are planning to see the movie for the first time, I suggest you stop reading.           I have seen the Disney cartoon nemerous times, and i was always intreaged by the feeling of the headless horseman. People just don't forget the headless horseman there is a certain feeling about him that just cant be placed. His very form seems to symbolise power. The sound of his black horse's hove pounding the ground makes hearts beat faster in fear of excitement, I just don't know even though I have seen the movie many times.The acting in the film was astounding! I especially feel sorry for cristopher Waklen who as it turns out, is terrified of horses! My love for this movie is all too great to put into words. My only sugestcion for you is to sit back, try to enjoy and hold on to your head!",Sleepy Hollow

You could practically sleep thru this turkey and wake up near the last ten minutes and have it all figured out.  Why people are fascinated by this type of filmaking is beyond me.  Yes the special effects are good, this is what Hollywood does best-pour all the money into the effects and leave no money or time for a decent script.The lines were read with no passion whatsoever, espiecially by Ms. Ricci, ugh!  Great acting by Johnny Depp you say?  Give me a break, maybe just a notch above the Ricci performance, a very small notch.  The best performance here is by Christopher Walken, and his role is none speaking!

If we could converse one movie still into a painting, it's almost certain that art critics and historians would be having quite some job for many years! Everything looks so alive and fluid and I had the feeling the background itself was narrating the story as well...An astonishing work by Tim Burton who now has set the standards so hight that I think the only director can pass them, is himself!",Sleepy Hollow

First, the scenery and special effects are incredible -- the best, and if everything else worked as well, its austere presence might have made it a great film.But as soon as the actors open their mouths, you suddenly realize that you are sitting in your den watching a movie.  The story itself is full of cleché and melodrama, and the dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen. And as if that weren't bad enough, they made a fool out of the protagonist, and in my experience, you don't want to do that unless the film is a comedy.Bottom line: I had a hard time getting into it, and I wouldn't recommend it.",Sleepy Hollow

686,Terror000,Another Burton masterpeice!,10,1 August 2001,Tim Burton once again delievers a great film. So the story may not be like the original but who the hell cares. Example: Ichabod in the book is a school teacher not a constable. I guess Burton did this to make Ichabod a more cooler guy? Christina Ricci is an excellent Catrina and no one could have done it better. I especially liked all of the elders of the town. Each one of them had a special personality. The characters were very well developed in this film. You could have guessed right away that this was a Tim Burton film because of the dark atomosphere which was simply amazing. Minus all the blood and decapitations this is more of a mystery than a horror film. Even with the R rating I think all types of people will love this film. It is an american lengend relived with some twists. 9/10 for this blockbuster film.,Sleepy Hollow

(it IS their lives, after all...i'd run for sure) you have to be into storytelling, or else the movie will seem to move at a slower pace than expected. have fun!",Sleepy Hollow
689,save_us_yh,And I Thought Alice In Wonderland Was Bad...,3,13 July 2012,"I was struggling to find something to rent on the DVD part of Netflix and after some horrible suggestions (No, Netflix, I do not want to see ""Meet The Dweedles""!), I suddenly remembered this movie and that I had wanted to give it a try. I guess there was a reason I forgot all about it...So Sleepy Hollow is just...I dunno---I want to say bad, but it's not completely bad---it's a movie where special tastes are required. My biggest complaint about this movie is that it doesn't quite know what it's supposed to be. In my opinion; in my viewing, it would alternate from thriller to comedy to just plain weird. Even the characters don't know what their supposed to be sometimes. In some scenes, Depp is afraid of a spider but then has no problem fighting a ghost! In some scenes, he is afraid of the ghost but no longer fears insects! Also, Christina Ricci's character seemed to be going in and out of a English accent. I guess she forgot she was in a movie or something...Another setback this movie has is the acting. There are some of the best actors in the world (not you Ricci!) in this picture and yet, somehow they all manage to give the worst performances they could manage! Especially, at the end, when the villain is revealed and gives their ""Why I Am Evil"" speech! I'm sorry but that actress just stunk out that scene. It was so bad that it took me out of the moment and made me laugh. If you're intending a movie to be scary or intense, then that performance should not be the one you went with! Another cringing actor was the child who played Depp's sidekick. Very wooden. Sorry kid...The story is alright; nothing like the original short story but that is to be expected. My problem with the story/characters is that every thing seems fast paced, not explained or magically solved. Depp and Ricci fall in love in about ten seconds. Literally. He enters the house for the FIRST time. She, blind folded, kisses him. They're in love now, for no apparent reason. Another example of the weird writing is how Depp's character seems to know everything without any real knowledge. His character is supposed to be intelligent and fact based. He doesn't believe in magic or ghosts or what have you---BUT THEN HE SEEMS TO KNOW EVERY SINGLE SUPERNATURAL THING IN THE MOVIE! He says something like, ""That's the Tree of Death---it leads to Hell!"". HOW WOULD HE KNOW THAT? I wonder if Burton proof reads or anything...The effects, make up and visuals are pretty enjoyable. Albeit, a bit cheesy. Especially the blood. It looks like red pudding. The houses, forests, backgrounds and all that look great, but lack color. The effects are good for their time; but some murders look more silly than terrifying. Lastly, Christopher Walken as the Headless Ghost is a mixed bag. He is a great actor---one of my favorites---but his costume or makeup was really silly. Vampire-like teeth and blue eyes. REALLY? THAT'S THE BEST YOU COULD DO? There's one part, where, after his horse is shot, he is supposed to be sad, looking at his horse, but with his stupid vampire teeth, wacky contacts and no actual dialogue, it was hard to convey his emotions. Actually, he looked silly and it made me laugh again because Walken is just (I mean this in a good way) weird looking already, so it's hard to take a sentimental moment with him (dressed like a monster, no less) seriously...In conclusion, I really wanted to enjoy this movie as I like Tim Burton's overall style (I just really dislike him as a person but I respect his talent) and this story is exactly Burton's taste but with the horrible acting, plot holes, character plot holes and the movie not knowing what it wanted to be, I couldn't get that much into it. It's worth rental or watch; or a good Halloween movie but only serious Burton fans will want to own this dud!1-Worst. Movie.

690,angvil_the_great,The best Tim Burton movie so far hes brilliant (and Johnny Depp is so hot!!!!),10,4 November 2003,"Sleepy Hollow is about The Headless Horseman. Everyone should know the story but if you don't this movie is the best way to find out! I loved every minute of it Tim Burton has such a great imagination its so hard to believe most of his movies come out of his head. It also has Johnny Depp who is the best actor ever! He is funny in nearly every movie hes in and he gets into the part (and hes H.O.T). Also Christina Ricci is in it and shes brilliant to. I admire this movie, one because it was the first horror movie that i could sit through with my eyes glued to the screen, two because Johnny Depp is in it, and three because its about the Headless Horseman. If you haven't seen this movie get to a video store now and rent or buy it because its brilliant work ;)",Sleepy Hollow
691,rockstar2545,waves of adventure and mystery,10,18 June 2004,"I love the movie sleepy hollow because its so mysterious and different.there are no other movies with a headless horseman who cuts heads off to find his own head.i like the fact that all the clues come together at the end of the movie.throughout the movie you find clues, and at the end of it, all the clues come together and you find out who caused the horsemans search for his head.also, the actors /actresses kept a straight face and had the right thoughts so it made the movie way better because the thoughts in someones head actually shows in their eyes and you could see that they had the right thoughts so it made it more real.i loved the movie it is one of my top five favorite movies.",Sleepy Hollow
692,wertyll,The best movie of the late 90's,10,26 March 2005,"As we all know, Tim Burton is a master Director and if you have seen some of his earlier works, like Edward scissorhands or Nightmare before Christmas, your familiar with his kind of Gothic style. It's wonderful. The way he does the telling of the story, the way he puts his own style in his movies is always excellent.I mean, everything, absolutely everything, is perfect in this movie. The lights, the effects, the amazing music by Danny Elfman and, of course, the actors.Johnny Depp does a great job as constable Ichabod Crane, the man who faints 6 times in this movie. The town's elder people is also geniously played, and Christina Ricci shows some acting talent. But, there is one actor who's not that good, especially not compared to Depp, Ricci and the others, and that is Miranda Richardson. I don't think that she's any good in this movie. But even though it's one of my absolute favorite movies. Even though it can be a little tricky to to remember who's who the first time you see the movie, see it. over and over again.",Sleepy Hollow
693,andreifuf,My favorite horror movie,9,1 November 2009,"This is the first Johnny Depp /Tim Burton movie that i have seen. It is simply an entertaining horror movie with a nice gloomy atmosphere which I much enjoy. I am a horror fan, but I'm not the Exorcist kind of horror fan. I like this one better, it has a more Gothic, beautiful yet dark atmosphere, it doesn't rely on gore and violence, but on the creepiness of the surroundings, like the human-like trees, mist and scarecrows.It's the images that impressed me the most. The hamlet covered in darkness and mist is the most persistent image for me, and it reminds me more of a desaturated painting rather than a movie. The apparent tranquility adds to the creepiness of the whole thing, it reminds of the Grimm Brothers' stories (and of Gilliam's movie which has a very similar look by the way). Another powerful image is the town folks whose' deformed faces are like Halloween masks (the mayor, the reverend, and so forth). They seem like caricatures, which adds to the overall sense of surreal. The interior scenes resemble Dutch Renaissance paintings.Johnny Depp gives a breathtaking performance in his role of Ichabod Crane. He doesn't try too hard, which I like, and carries the whole movie. As in other Burton movies, Depp wears strange glasses at times and uses some sort of steam punk-styled gadgets. The other characters are less developed but enjoyable. I also appreciate the spectacular fighting scenes, they seem like titanic clashes between even opponents, and they are quite memorable.I give the movie 4 out of 5 stars.",Sleepy Hollow

695,robbins-jerry,Where is Washington Irving?,2,19 July 2005,"OK, I liked the picture as a horror film - but I think I would have enjoyed it more had they just used a headless horseman, and called the film something else. This has NOTHING to do with the original story - just the names and the title remain. With the creative talents involved with this picture, why did they have to ruin the original story? Not enough blood I guess. If one has never read the original book, I'm sure they would love this film (it is visually stunning); but for someone like myself who loves the book, this picture was a great let down. The new rule in Hollywood for adapting great works of literature? Change the story, film it dark, add lots of mud, and oh yes, don't forget the blood. What a shame. Where is Vincent Minnelli when you need him? In this version, heads are spinning off bodies; and I would bet Mr. Irving is spinning in his grave.",Sleepy Hollow

Johnny Depps part in this is very good and it has to be said that he is very nice looking and another one of my favourite actors stars in this, Christina Ricci's acting brings a very unique personality to this character. This film is one of Tim Burtons best films and it is the one that persuaded me to watch the rest of his movies for example Ed Wood, Edward Scissorhands and Beetle Juice it was a great evening in. Tim Burton is definitely my favourite director and has made some of the best films ever",Sleepy Hollow

But, what I did get proved to be just as good - if not better- than what I had expected. This film is really really funny! Johnny Depp is an absolute comedy genius!! When Ichabod is in bed after seeing the horseman, Johnny's acting is 100% spot on, though for him that is nothing new. Christina Ricci too, acted well in this, though her accent confused me a little. What is it meant to be? This film is good, not one of my favourites, but entertaining none-the-less. The only real disappointing part of the film is the ending, which I found a bit too, I don't know how to put it into words, fade-y I guess lol. I loved the horses as well, they were amazing! A fun film, no doubt about it!!!",Sleepy Hollow
698,Alextube,A film worth watching,7,22 November 2005,"Near the end of the 18th century, a gentleman police officer comes to a Dutch colonist community, northwards the state of New York, in order to conduct investigation around a series of repulsive murders, where the residents believe are committed by a revenging headless horseman.The rational, sober young man with his vanward, for his time, methods of medical jurisprudence, although hesitant at first, doesn't take too long to understand that the legend is based on truth, while at the same time develops a special relationship with the enigmatic daughter of a local eminent resident...Tim Burton tries to adapt one of the most popular Gothic fables of American literature (written by Irving Washington in the 1800s) to his monumental filming universe. It is obvious here, that we are a few steps away from the typical Burton thorniness (the stain of diversity and the non-acceptance by an environment intolerant), not however from the peculiar tonality that lives each of the authors work ; result of his beautiful use of stylized, austere, plain rhythm in writing, melancholy, and the use of eccentric humor and picturesqueness in narration.Brilliantly incorporated are the superbly made special effects, when, and where needed in order to accelerate the effect of fiction - while the music as well as the recreation of the era are worked and given attention in every single detail. Slightly ""slack"" remains perhaps the content, in mainly what has to do with the characters, if at the end we come to accept that the characters are not just ""ordinary"" people. The actors are doing pretty well their job, and Depp confirms with his performance that he's got more than just the looks. Anyway, none of Burton's work lacks importance and special interest, something that all his (many) fans know very well.This is a film well worth watching, scary but not too much this one has Tim Burton written all over it. There is only this little something missing that makes a great film differ from a truly amazing one.",Sleepy Hollow
699,empressphoenix4,Jumped out of my skin...,10,27 April 2006,"This was an over all excellent movie. There isn't any one word to describe this movie. First of all it's a Tim Burton film so you're to expect the unexpected from this genius. For those who don't know, Sleepy Hollow is based on a legend and book. Basically, a headless horseman has been going around Sleepy Hollow, terrorizing the residents of this isolated town. When two residents have been murdered, the 'town elders' call on Constable Ichabod Crane (played by Johnny Depp) to solve the mystery. Other characters include Katrina Anne Van Tassle (Christina Ricci) and a handful of power house British actors that give life to this Burton masterpiece. The overall mood of the movie is dark. Every minute is filled with suspense. It was straight-forward (absolutely no mercy) when it came to the murdering of each victim. Burton must be going for a world record and see how much blood he could throw onto Depp during the entire movie. The headless horseman was ruthless and pure evil. Depp's portrayal of Ichabod Crane was absolutely stunning. Although at the start he looked like the perfect hero (good-looking, calm and wise demeanor, in-charge, intelligent)his flaws come as quickly as you thought he was the perfect man for the job. He was a flawed man who tried to look strong on the outside but absolutely faints at the sight of blood and is terrified of bugs and pests on the inside. Depp definitely played this character right. Ricci was credible as the innocent (or so you'd think), naive and beautiful love interest of Ichabod Crane. Overall, this movie made me and my best friend, jump out of our skins. In my opinion the best Tim Burton film ever.",Sleepy Hollow
700,rossking-89344,Roller coaster,9,14 July 2020,"A Tim Burton's masterpiece, sleepy hollow is a film that perfectly balances the nausea of horror with the unending laughs of comedy. The film set at the dawn of the millennium features acts like Johnny Depp playing ""Ichabond Crane"" , Christina Ricci plays Katrina Van Tassel the daughter of old Baltus Van Tassel ""Michael Gambon"". The film which is an adaptation based on ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving, revolves around a curious police detective ""Johnny Depp"" with a knack for investigative gadgets and never ending questions which puts him at odds with his colleagues and the new york city judge that eventually led to his fateful detective assignment at sleepy hollow. A headless horseman has been set loose and he is rampaging the city beheading all his victims in one single swoosh of his sword on the neck. Ichabond Crane discovers his victims were not random but targeted specifically by someone with revenge on their mind. Emmanuel Lubezki skillfully cinematographed the city of sleepy hollow casting it out directly as a somber town with little or no mood of life where death and dying is a common event., windows are constantly shut and doors always securely locked. An overly de- saturated look leaves that expressionistic style which Tim Burton is well known for. A touch of romance is visible in this epic film between Ichabond Crane and Katrina, which distracts the viewer a bit from the horrific beheading by the headless horseman to a more gentle side of the story. Crane must unravel the mystery of the hessian ghost that rides in the woods cutting off the heads of his unsuspecting victims. At first it sounds like a local legend to Crane whom with his scientific and calculating mind disregards this bizarre murders as just mere workings of a murderer masking behind a myth. Sleepy Hollow is a roller coaster movie that will leave the viewer at the edge of their seat with bitter sweet taste in their mouth whether to love or hate the headless horseman. The story unfolds when crane himself experiences the headless horseman in action when he attacks and eventually beheads magistrate Phillipse ""Richard Griffiths"" leaving Crane shaken up and visibly scared beyond control. ""It was a horseman! A dead one! Headless!"" he remarks. The film was on a comedic tone when some of the town people played a prank on Crane imitating the headless horseman chasing and scaring Crane until he passes out to beautiful memories of his past.
Grossing over 200 million USD worldwide and bagging one academy award for best art direction ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a must watch film from start to finish one can see, feel and be captivated by the story, journeying with Ichabond Crane as he goes on his task of answering and solving forensic investigations of this bizarre murders that has been plaguing the town of sleepy hollow.",Sleepy Hollow
701,joan_white_angel,it's a great horror movie,9,10 February 2006,"For me this is one of the best horror movies ever. The story (the headless horseman) is an American classic. The movie doesn't quite follow the original story but is a very good version. Johnny is great. Johnny's character (Ichabod Crane)is very different from the Washington Irving's character but Johnny plays it wonderfully, he is quite funny sometimes and you never know what is going in his mind. Miranda Richardson is fantastic as always (playing once more one of the bad characters), Michael Gambon as well. Casper Van Dien, Jeffrey Jones, Christopher Lee, Richard Griffiths and Ian McDiarmid are great actors but this movie does not show them at their best. Christopher Walken was great as the headless horseman, he was really scary (with those blue eyes and sharp-edged teeth who wouldn't?!). Christina Ricci was the one that disappointed me. Her character was not what I expected and she didn't seem very convincing to me. No offence. I hope it isn't taken because I think she's a good actress but this one didn't got out very well. The special effects were fantastic, the tree of the dead and the windmill scene... well you will see what I mean after watching the movie. And the last but not less important facts: Tim Burton and Danny Elfman. Those two work really well together. Tim is a great director and Danny's fantastic soundtrack complete each other.A funny thing: when I started seeing the movie for the first time I thought it was black and white.",Sleepy Hollow

Unfortunately, it does not. The film can't settle on being a spoof of itself or a truly shocking film or even a serious detective story, and while Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci try to figure out which way to act it, we get bored waiting...",Sleepy Hollow

When the time came, I sat in the theater with a friend of mine staring at the screen in disbelief. A fantastic story was taken and basically raped.

But if you go into it just expecting to have fun, you won't be disappointed at all. Aside from just being fun, Tim Burton makes this the coolest looking movie of the year by far.  He's come up with some great looking landscapes. Johnny Depp is at his best.  And the headless horseman is the best bad guy of the year, forget Darth Maul.  You wouldn't expect there to be much investigating for Depp's Ichabod Crane to do. I mean, it's obvious some headless dude is chopping people's heads off, but the story manages to be quite an entertaining ""Who done it?"" I'd give something away if I elaborated, so I'll leave it at that.  Burton obviously has fond feelings toward the old Disney cartoon ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,"" because he throws in all kinds of little nods to the classic cartoon. He even uses frog noises that sound like ""Ichabod.""  If you like the old cartoon at all - and who doesn't ? - you need to see this movie.",Sleepy Hollow

Batman 1&2 where true masterpieces of darkness as were Edward Scissorhands or The Nightmare before Christmas but what is this? It´s not a parody because it takes itself much too seriously, it´s not horror because there is nothing to be frightened of. The first other movie that came to my mind after seeing this was ""The Mummy"" which is in my opinion a very commercial film made for the masses based on Special FX featuring a stupid story and everyday characters. But what I missed most to see in Sleepy Hollow was the Tim Burton typical love for Detail.",Sleepy Hollow
711,Celestia-2,A typical Tim Burton movie.,6,24 November 1999,"If you enjoy Tim Burton movies, you will certainly enjoy this one. Although not particularly true to the original story, or even the Disney version, the movie does contain all the elements that make Sleepy Hollow a classic scare story.  Also throughout the movie are little touches that just scream Tim Burton.  Edward Scissorhands, Batman, Nightmare Before Christmas, and Beetlejuice all receive a nod in this movie (whether intentional or not I don't know).Sleepy Hollow does deserve the rating it has been given due to a few instances of gore.  It certainly isn't the Disney story we all remember from childhood.  Although, there are just as many laughs as there are squirms.

Tim Burton did a great job in directing this. This is definetly a must see.",Sleepy Hollow
713,ibellum,A Different Take on the Film,8,4 December 1999,"I might reveal more than you want to know about this movie.. so beware of reading it:: Everyone seems to be commenting on the scare quality, the beautiful cinematography, and the deviation from the original story, whenever this movie is disucssed. I think there might be more to this movie than that. Think of it this way, if you were a geeky kid, like Tim Burton, you would relate to Ichabod Crane. But Crane loses in the original story to the ""jock"", and it is hinted that the horsemen is most likely not a real ghost. But obviously Burton enjoyed the story, so he took it, and made his own version where Crane over comes his squeamish fears and saves the day against a real ghost. If you want me to give some proof, think of the little boy watching the candle show. The Horesemen only ever killed those he was ordered to kill, or made a strong attempt to stop him(like the jock). But he goes after the little boy who was watching ""moving pictures"" made by a candle-powered toy. That little boy is the link to Tim Burton, and the reason he did Sleepy Hollow. He did it all for himself. Oh yes, and did anyone notice the sly joke at the audience: Depp calls the year 1799 the last year of the millenium on two ocassions, when really that applies only to the 1999 audience.",Sleepy Hollow
714,Trent-30,Dark and beautiful!,9,17 March 2000,"This film is brilliant from first frame to last.Tim Burton is once again on top form and he can only get better working as usual with the talents of Johnny Depp in a fantastic performance and Danny Elfman with a superb music score.The plot is fairly simple.Johnny Depp is sent to the small town of Sleepy Hollow to investigate a gruesome murder spree taken up by a headless horse man who is claiming the heads of some of the townsfolk.Is there a reason behind all this? This is what Depp is trying to find out while the murders still continue.Excellent support provided by Christina Ricci and Christopher Walken who is outstanding yet again.The whole film is brilliantly made with some breathtaking cinematography, and an authentic gothic atmosphere.Although there is a lot of heads rolling the film is not very violent as it manages to keep a comic-horror look in everything.Easily the best film Burton made in years and the kind of films that only he can do.Hugely enjoyable and not to be missed.",Sleepy Hollow
715,asgeir,A truly stunning film,9,19 November 1999,"Tim Burton has done it again. It seems he can't really go wrong; especially when he's paired with Johnny Depp. Sleepy Hollow is the most visually stunning movie I have seen this year. The production is gorgeous in every way; the cinematography is hauntingly beautiful, the set design is incredible and the way Burton uses the color red to accentuate the lack of color and dreariness otherwise experienced in Sleepy Hollow is a visual treat. This movie is just absolutely beautiful to watch. The performances are flawless, I have to commend Burton for using such a great array of underappreciated character actors, such as Jeffrey Jones and Michael Gough.. and even poor little Casper Van Dien; the man just can't seem to get any respect (and he doesn't here either). Ricci is wonderful in a role totally against type, and Depp is refreshing as ever. Christopher Walken is just the coolest guy ever, and as the Headless Horseman he's even scarier than normal. The best thing, though, is Danny Elfman's music. Why on earth doesn't the man have an Oscar yet? What is going on?? He should at least get a nomination for this one.",Sleepy Hollow
716,Andre-54,A throwback horror film that enchants and spooks.,7,19 November 1999,"Take a step back in time and think of the classic black and white horror movies.  Step it up a notch with a lot more intensity and refined camera work, throw two young perfectly cast leads, and what you have is the latest Tim Burton installment of creative and flawless art.  Burton simplifies the world in a way that we aren't let down, because we aren't overloaded. Sleepy Hollow is the most beautiful approach to solid entertainment. Every day is as creepy as the night, and at times you may just want to reach out and touch the curled twigs framing the screen. Be careful not to get suckered in to thinking that this is reality, because you could end up laughing at the movie.  This is a fable.  It is melodramatic.  It isn't the best movie of 1999 but it is refreshing for a director to create a world of his own and invite us into it.  Sleepy Hollow pays respect to the films that chilled us before reality was necessity.",Sleepy Hollow
717,smorris1,Wow...just wow...,10,19 November 1999,"If you're not a Tim Burton fan, I can only sympathize with your position. If like me, however, you are . . . I have to say, this movie will leave you clamoring to see every other Burton movie you can get your hands on, regardless of how many times you have seen them already. His use of colours in the film was absolutely unreal! Depp's acting was superb, Walken was wicked as usual, even Ricci wasn't that bad . . . she fit her part rather aptly. But the person who leaves their mark most prominently on this movie is Burton himself. The way he crafts the story around his image of Sleepy Hollow was excellent. Lastly, it should be noted that the movie would have suffered much without Danny Elfman's contribution. This was, indeed, the most picturesque movie I have seen in quite a long time.",Sleepy Hollow
718,burke_gallagher,A great ride!,7,22 November 1999,"One can expect, in a big-budget Thanksgiving spectacular, that the story would depart from the original macabre tale of an awkward school teacher. Once you anticipate Ichabod as a preternaturally handsome, fidgity NYC constable and a healthy dose of kitsch you will find the movie easier to enjoy.Elfman's scores are always a valuable part of Burton's vision, and his music for Sleepy Hollow is no exception. Burton's presentation might have become heavy-handed for me by the end had it not been for an interesting score. His directing scheme for this one featured (you guessed it!) scenes low on color and high on mist. It has become a Burton cliche (Beetlejuice, Scissorhands, Batman, Nightmare) to give his scenes little color and his leading men lots of vertical/shadowy light, but it simply keeps working in Sleepy Hollow.Cast and acting: no real detractors (unless Ichabod's cowardice wears on you), the townspeople were well cast and thoughtfully acted, Christina Ricci has come into her own (few hints of Tuesday or Pecker's girlfriend), and Christopher Walken steals the show in his limited maniacal scenes.In all, the film could have benefitted from some better editing. In its two hours, a few too many people get killed, and though their deaths generally pack a visceral thrill, a touch of restraint might have added to the suspense. Many moviegoers will wish for more restraint in the blood dept. Believe the tagline, heads most certainly will roll; I didn't find it all that gruesome, but I can see how one might.A few times Burton cashes in on cheap thrills and laughs, but this is still his finest since Batman. The story remains interesting despite the changes and the horseman is awesome (in the traditional biblical sense of the word). Expect some Hollywood-ization of the original, suspend your disbelief and enjoy the hell out of this one on the big screen.",Sleepy Hollow
719,sdelaere,terrible film with good effects,4,13 March 2000,"This was an awful film. I really don't see why others like it. The script, this so-called wonderful plot, failed completely! The evil witch practically had to TELL the whole story to the viewer so that he would grasp it! And what Depp had to speak out! ""Interesting... very interesting..."" he mumbles. It's just one of the many examples of the insane simplicity that disgusted me. Yes, simplicity. Depp's character has been sketched very rudely without any kind of ""nuance"", and so is that of the other actors. The childish arachnaphobia scene is a living proof of this. And the mistakes. I searched for sharp teeth in the Horseman's skull, but couldn't find them; a few seconds later, revived, the teeth were sharp as knives! Come on... The atmosphere had something Wizard-of-Oz-ish and also the same fake darkness in lighting and settings as Tim Burtons' ""Nightmare before Christmas"".Just Terrible. Worst film in months. This makes me almost desperate to see ""the Straight Story"" a second time.",Sleepy Hollow
720,kuochyi,Great Film!,8,31 October 1999,"I just watched Sleepy Hollow last night at a preview screening and I have to say that I was not disappointed! I have always been impressed with Tim Burton's work, and with this film he has lived up to expectations once again. Visually, it was typical Tim Burton, dark and mysterious with a fantasy/fairy tale feel, carried out through the spectacular sets, dark costumes and deathly make-up. Johnny Depp was brilliant as the straight-laced, cowardly Ichabod Crane, prone to fainting spells. Also to be applauded were the performances by Christina Ricci, Christopher Walken, and Miranda Richardson. I also particularly enjoyed the performance by Ichabod's young sidekick, who's name, unfortunately, escapes me.  :(Story wise, the film can get a little campy with some rather mechanical lines, but I was personally willing to forgive them in exchange for some of Burton's typically dark humor, causing many audience members, including myself, to both laugh and groan at the same time. One word of caution though, for those who are planning to watch this movie with children. Believe the tagline to the movie, ""Heads Will Roll,"" because it's true. Heads are rolling everywhere in this movie, blood is splashing, and it can get rather gory. When I think Tim Burton, I think of ""Nightmare before Christmas"" and ""Beetlejuice"", filled with dark humor, but nothing that will ""scar"" kids. Not so with this movie. Beware the faint of heart! The beheadings (among other several other scenes) can look quite real in action and might be disturbing to young viewers, so make sure whomever you bring to watch this movie will be able to handle it.But if you don't mind the blood and gore, and you have a sense of humor and a taste for the fantastic, be sure to put this movie at the top of your list!",Sleepy Hollow
721,knulprek,About as exciting as a yawn.,1,27 November 1999,"Adored by fans for his unusually charming creativity and by Hollywood for his softball, user-friendly movie-making techniques, Tim Burton tipped the scales too far in formula's favor with his new upset of a cinematic legend, Sleepy Hollow. Following the quest of Ichabod Crane  played by Johnny Depp, delivering this dreary film's only shining point  to the heart of the mystery surrounding a town's seemingly random and gruesome murders by a fabled headless horseman, the story plays out as if it were purposely trying to be repugnantly predictable. Contrived as a children's bedtime story, humdrum character introduction is laced with intended-upon exciting non-engaging chase scenes which, with undeveloped characters fleeing for their lives, produce about as much fright and thrill as The Nightmare Before Christmas.Toss in an endless bundle of old trees for ambience and a wide-eyed, big-busted blonde love interest (Christina Reechi) and Burton has himself a movie that takes the age-old legend of Sleepy Hollow and succeeded in making it like a Disney movie without the charm or captivation. Dialog was choppy and ridiculous, severed heads were aplenty, and there were enough plot-revealing monologues to embarrass the likes of James Bond. Even with the backing of Emmanuel Lubezki, the most sought-after cinematographer in Hollywood today, the wonderful acting of Depp and Burton's astounding name-recognition, Sleepy Hollow is nothing to lose your head over.",Sleepy Hollow
722,memphisfan,Absolutely Awesome Movie!,10,22 November 1999,"This was a great movie.  Most people realize it and have given it good reviews.  I truly don't understand some people's opinions though.  I gave it a 10.  I can understand that not everybody thinks it should get a 10, but some people actually gave it a 1 or 2, etc...  How someone can rate it that low completely puzzles me.Everything about this movie was great.  The scenery, sound effects, and music were great.  The acting was great, as was the humor, horror, and mystery.  I saw it on November 2'nd and had to see it again on November 19'th.  I even liked it better the second time.  It certainly seemed that everybody in the theater thought it was great.  There was a lot of crowd reaction.  The things I personally liked the most were the twisted plot and wonderful looking set.  The headless horseman's raw power was great too. It's a lot more interesting watching him ride after his victims than it is to watch a guy with a chainsaw or hook chasing someone.  It was like a mysterious world that everything happened in.  I loved the foggy, misty atmosphere and spooky music.The one thing that shows how great it is is that Roger Ebert gave it 3 and 1/2 stars!  If you look at what he has given other horror movies, it's obvious that it has something other movies don't.  He even said that he was surprised at how good it was.  When you go to a theater expecting something to be bad and then rate it 3 and 1/2 stars out of 4, it is extremely effective.  I can't wait until it's on DVD.  The user ratings on this site show that about 2/3 of the votes are 8-10 stars.  There are MANY 9's and 10's.  I'm glad to see that most people recognize the numerous strengths of this movie.  Some people have said Ichabod's flashbacks should have been left out.  I agree they either should have been more important to the plot or left out.  Still, that doesn't make the rating any less than a perfect ten!",Sleepy Hollow
723,table30,The Scariest Movie I Have Ever Seen,10,19 November 1999,"I caught a sneak preview of this movie last night. Tim Burton has made a masterpiece. I have never been one to be scared by a movie, but this movie had me shaking in my seat. The Headless Horseman is a more terrifying villain than Darth Vader, Freddy Krueger and Hannibal Lecter rolled into one. The entire movie is beautiful and so is Christina Ricci. This is Depp's best work since Fear & Loathing in Las Vegas. And this is definatley Tim Burton's most memorable film. You'll be holding your neck when you leave and fearing anything that sounds like a galloping horse. For more of my reviews, see my website",Sleepy Hollow
724,tamas.vincze,Excellently eerie with terrific scenes!,9,7 April 2000,This movie is a must. It is a classical blood-curdler with lots of bits of humour.

725,Ethan Quin,Great Atmosphere and Style but Suffering Story,7,19 November 1999,"Tim Burton was perfect for this, so was the cast, and what really brought this film to life was the atmosphere. Burton pulled off a dark moody 1700s landscape complete with fog and mist right out of the 50s-60s horror movie classics and it works well. Most of the characters look almost created by Burton himself having certain personalities that make the parts absent of the headless horseman enjoyable. When the headless horseman does appear it is pulled off very well partly do to good special effects and Ray Park (Darth Maul from Episode One). What confused me was the story. The story tries to weave the old tale of sleepy hollow into a mystery while providing a action gore fest for those who couldn't keep up with the whole plot. The reason for this being the background of the characters and their names which still remain distant to me (except those from the Disney cartoon). I liked the dark humor Burton usually tries to thrown in and Depp along with Ricci played good roles as they usually do. I would see this movie as I did, at a matinee. Its a beautiful film scarred by a dull who-done-it mystery story. And on a final note, It was nice to see Christopher Walken, but did he really need to growl and yell all the time? :)  7/10",Sleepy Hollow

I went expecting a horror movie, and it sure delivered. The only real problem with the movie I had was the romantic element, but hey, that's just me. Sometimes it seems like everyone is trying to make a movie that EVERYONE will like. You know, cut off some heads for the guys and throw in a love story for the girls. Overall though, despite the lovey-dovey aspect, this is an incredible movie with amazing special effects and a stunning backdrop.Go see it, I give it an 7.7",Sleepy Hollow

The central ideas of the blindness of bigotry, what makes a witch bad, what makes an honest person good, and who's the biggest fool of the two, are all deftly handled, and the HUMOUR through-out is really rather good, if slightly gory (or should that be ""Edward Gorey"") in a ""black"" kinda vein. Definately not one for people that don't like swords,  decapitation and Mr Depp.",Sleepy Hollow
728,bobafet1,Probably the most beautiful film ever made,8,19 November 1999,"well, tim burton has really done it this time.  After making such visual tour de forces as ""Edward scissorhands"" and ""batman returns"", he has made the truly stunning ""sleepy hollow.""  the movie stars johnny depp and christina ricci, and has a list of cameos a mile long that includes Christopher walken, christopher lee, and martin landau.  The production design and art direction of this film are truly breathtaking.  The way the trees come to life, the eeriness of the woods, the colors of they sky, it is just simply gorgeous.  and the dark tone that the film establishes very early really makes this movie a treat to see in a dark theatre.  The effects are top notch as well, and the blood stands apart from all blood you may have seen in other movies.  This blood is so bright and stands out so much from the background.  it is beautiful.  this film is in the tradition of the hammer horror classics of old, and it certainly looks like one.  the horseman (played by Ray Park, who incidentally also played Darth Maul) is also a great villain.  the choreography  of the fights is done very well, especially since the guy has no head!!  the performances are also very good, especially johnny depp who brings a lot to the character of Ichabod Crane. He sometimes will remind you of a little prissy girl, but thats good in the situations of this movie.  the story also keeps the movie moving quite fast, as you will keep asking yourself and others around you ""who is controlling the horseman?""  this movie is truly a treat and should be enjoyed by all. 9/10",Sleepy Hollow
729,gatorsong,"If you like Tim Burton films, you'll love this one.",8,25 November 1999,"This movie, while not ""by the book"", is a wonderful interpretation of the characters and world created by Washington Irving.I have always enjoyed Tim Burton's movies and think that this has got to be one of the best.  The story flows right along and with the exception of a couple of points, never slows down.   There are some really great plot twists, and also, there are a couple of really good cameos.(the horseman especially).Tim Burton, I believe, has found a really good thing in Johnny Depp and I'm glad to see that he keeps using him in his movies. Mr. Depp always performs remarkably and this movie is no exception.  There are some really great scenes with him playing the consummate inspector, and also some other really fun scenes when the inspector loses his cool.The interplay between Mr. Depp and Cristina Ricci is very nice as well.  To me, the connection between their characters seems very genuine.Overall this is a wonderful movie.  I've been recommending everyone I know to go see it, and I plan on seeing it again.  This is yet another mastery on Mr. Burton's part and will be a definite video to own when it comes out.",Sleepy Hollow

Tim Burton keeps his style and give us a film with all the things he is used to manipulate; a grey atmosphere over a black canvas during all over the film with touches, and sometimes splashes of brightful contrasts in oranges and reds that are worthy to remember.A very good Johnny Depp, once again with Burton, and very well accompained with a beautiful Christina Ricci. The appearances of great movie stars of all time are a gift to all the viewers -Christopher Lee, Martin Landau (on one of his best performances ever), and the perfect horseman that could only be played by Christopher Walken....A plot with no holes, moments of laugh, moments in tears, very good costumes, excellent sounds effects that impress every ear around, together they make a future golden classic and a present not-to-miss feature...",Sleepy Hollow

I've written the novelization, and I'd just like to suggest that if you enjoyed the movie, read the book!  It includes scenes cut from the film, some of which explain confusing plot points.

I am not the type of person who enjoys violence and blood and stuff like that but ""Sleepy Hollow"" did not give me nightmares or anything like that.  The filming was so great and the setting was beautiful.  I was slightly disappointed with the ending but it wasn't a big deal--I got over it.  Ray Park's (Darth Maul) stuntwork was just about the coolest--he's my idol now I think.  And Christopher Walken was incredibly freaky, especially his eyes.  But if you don't like the whole Gothic horror thing, then go for the love story.  And if you don't like love stories, well, girls, go because Johnny Depp as pale, squeamish, all-black wearing Ichabod Crane is to die for.  MMMHMM!",Sleepy Hollow
733,cmford2000,"great cinematography, excellent acting, poor script",7,20 November 1999,"I'd been looking forward to seeing this movie ever since I saw the trailor, which was great. I'm a big Tim Burton fan; and Johnny Depp & Christina Ricci are great actors. Unfortunately I left the theater disappointed. while the movie is wonderful visually, the story really needed some work.Mr. Burton made this story into too much of a whodunnit for my taste. I was expecting more of a horror story. There are too many charaters, who are barely developed at all, so I didn't much care who the killer was or why he/she was doing it.
On the plus side, the acting was first rate. Johnny Depp is hilarious as Ichabod Crane.  His reaction after seeing the headless horseman is priceless.  Christina Ricci makes a whole lot of nothing in her role opposite Depp.  I can't even remember her character's name, it was so porely developed. But she has so much presence onscreen, and chemistry with Depp, she somehow makes it work. I hope they make another movie together.
As for the character of the horseman, like the rest of the movie, the cup is half full. He starts out as an unstoppable monster, bringing death upon everyone he meets. Ray Parks does an incredible job in the fight scenes. Unfortunately, we come to learn that he is not killing randomely, but is after selected targets. It ruins the suspense when Ichabod can be around this monster without fearing for life. The movie sure is good to look at, though.  I'd give it 3 stars.",Sleepy Hollow

735,phreak3d,Hollow indeed...,6,24 November 1999,"What a great idea:Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands, Batman) directing a screenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker (Se7en, 8mm) about a headless horseman who rides around on a giant steed performing multiple decapitations.It certainly sounds good on paper, and looked damn good in the trailers. However, the end result is nothing more than a visual feast lacking any cohesive plot.The story is about a young New York City constable who is sent to Sleepy Hollow to investigate a series of brutal murders, yes...decapitations.Throw in a little cheesy romance, some Hammer-esque acting, haunting visuals, and you got yourself a Tim Burton flick.This movie has more plot holes than a sheet of swiss cheese. It lacks any kind of rational cohesiveness or congruence from one scene to the next.Now...the question you've all been waiting for: Is it scary? Well...in a word: No. It's not suspenseful in the least, once you get past the foggy woods and huddling town buildings, there is really nothing else redeeming about this movie.2.5/4If you want to see ""real"" Tim Burton work, go watch Ed Wood and Edward Scissorhands again.",Sleepy Hollow
736,matt_1131,Halloween Candy In November?,6,26 November 1999,"Entertainment ala Burton. Sinister cinematic visuals, colored with light anecdote, and occasional sophomoric animation.The movie is worthy of viewing, keynoting the word view, but do not contemplate, or expect overpowering dialogue or story development. In fact, the grand finale will likely trouble you with a lengthy recitation of events that were not (but could have been) interwoven and developed in the plot. Therefore, throughout the movie, glimpses of seemingly unrelated, unimportant scenes will be presented (with audience wondering ""when will this stuff culminate""). Yet, a unique story (not Irving's original) is refreshing novelty, creating more curiosity and suspense. Criminology and forensics are tested against the Legend of Sleepy Hollow.
Moments of blood spurting, and dismemberment are forthcoming. Several Krafty, aka ""cheesy"", lines (this grammatical twist being representative of the film, not the reviewer) occasionally induce laughter. A few instances of characters with cartoonlike eye bulging and lolling tongues....during horror scenes....were reminiscent of Beetle Juice or Looney Tunes, and were out of synch with movie's flavor. In fact, more horrific than the Headless Horseman, it was hard to discern whether these effects were meant for horror or laughter. Costume, lighting, and other visual display are unarguably horror apperpo and convincingly eerie. Handsomely imaginative investigatory tools wielded by Crane are reminiscent of ""Scissorhands"", grotesquely large, clumsy, mechanical devices.In summation, a light-hearted ""fright"" movie earning early respect with handsome imagery and notable actors. Remove the sugar coating and what remains is a scantily clad, disproportionate skeleton of a story.",Sleepy Hollow
737,kbaley,An unbiased view from a huge Tim Burton/Johnny Depp fan,9,1 December 1999,"Okay, I'm being facetious. I am very strongly biased toward both Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. Keep that in mind as you read on...This movie is vintage Tim Burton from the stark forest to the skewed buildings in the village to the light snowfall at the end. As in most of his movies, the imagery and background are just important as the characters. If you've enjoyed Edward Scissorhands, Batman (and Batman Returns), and Ed Wood, you will almost certainly enjoy this.As expected, I thoroughly enjoyed Johnny Depp's performance. His confident, yet cowardly Crane adds another notch to an already impressive belt. Other Burton mainstays include Jeffrey Jones (slightly under-used here) and Michael Gough, both on their third Burton film.A couple of other bonuses: - Including Christopher Lee was a minor stroke of genius - The Headless Horseman is one of the coolest characters I've seen on film this year - Danny Elfman, an excellent film composer in his own right, creates his finest work for Tim Burton and this film is no exception.",Sleepy Hollow

It has done this not because of the great acting or the awesome visual effects, but because of the romance. With Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci they will make any movie good.

Poor, confusing plot surrounds a fearless, though gory, story-line.Disney's rendition was much more frightening.",Sleepy Hollow
740,The Critic,I've seen the Hollow! ...and I like it!,8,26 November 1999,"Tim Burton = Genius!Although I wouldn't call this the best film of all time, there ought to be a special Oscar award for Burton alone! Every film he directs is like a peak into his mind... and what a wonderfully warped mind it is!1. It's visually enchanting. You can't help but be drawn into the fantastic realm of the Headless Horseman. Is he real? see the movie!2. The story-line seemed somewhat disjointed at times, but the pace of action justified every innuendo. It all came together in the end. Remember folks, this is fantasy! Let loose!3. I was impressed with Christina Ricci's performance. I actually expected her over do the part; but she does quite the reverse. I sensed a constant downplaying of her character. Whether that was intended on her part, or the director's... or Depp's... I don't really care. She was convincing enough for me to conclude that she's honing her skills for better roles. Johnny Depp has a unique way of taking on odd roles. His portrayal of ""Constable"" Ichabod Crane seemed to be a combination of characters from Edward Scissor Hands, Ed Wood, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and 21 Jump Street. I wouldn't call it an Oscar performance either, but he's certainly entertaining to watch. I think he will one day receive an Oscar for a serious performance, but this isn't it. The supporting actors are quite interesting to look at... many of them are Burton contemporaries. If you're a fan of the psychoactive monsieur Tim, you're bound to recognised many of the cast. (Martin Landau; Christopher Lee; Miranda Richardson [excellent]; Jeffrey Jones; and Christopher Walken to name a few) For all the Star Wars buffs, I should add that Ray Park (Darth Maul) is one of the stuntmen for the headless Hessian!Verdict: I would recommend this film to anyone who doesn't mind a little bit of gore (lopping heads), a great deal of visual fantasia, and enough artistic license to create a sense of freshness to the original tale. (Many respects to Washington Irving) I will purchase this film when it's released on VHS or DVD format!",Sleepy Hollow

Johnny Depp was hilarious, and I think this was one of his best performances.  The sets and costumes were very effective in creating the perfect mood.

742,skaxury,Beautiful.,9,1 December 1999,"Sleepy Hollow is the most visually stimulating movie that I've ever seen. I would compare Tim Burton to the likes of Monet or Van Gogh. Every single scene was like an individual painting. Tim Burton has a way of taking something that is fantasy or dreamlike, and conveying that picture onto film like no other. This can also be seen in Batman or Edward Scissorhands. Artistically, aspects like the contrast of the red blood on Johnny Depp's white face just blew me away. Johnny Depp did an outstanding performance also. He totally brought new life to the character of Ichabod Crane. This film definitely stands out as a film which defines artistic filmmaking and places Tim Burton in a class of his own.",Sleepy Hollow

In my opinion Tim Burton is one of the most creative filmmakers ever.  I wasn't sure if this was going to be like the Disney cartoon or a real horror picture.  Well, horror film it is, and what a beautiful one too. Everything was impressive: the actors, the editing, the art direction, the soundetc.  What impressed me the most was the cinematography work by Emmanuel Lubezki, who also did ""A Little Princess"".  With his work and the dark, dreary art direction topped of with Danny Elfman's impressive score, you have a classic horror film.  Tim Burton really showed off his usual trademark of graves, decaying buildings and misty forests.  I won't give anything away but probably my favorite scenes are the nightmares that Ichabob Crane keeps having.  Those were truly frightnening.  Tim Burton you've done it again, and I can't wait for your next film.",Sleepy Hollow

Superb casting (Depp, Ricci, and Christopher Walken--could you think of any three actors who more perfectly fit Burton's style?) direction, set design and cinematography make this a must see.On a different note, anybody notice the Phantom Menace ""parallels""? First I notice that one of the main characters is none other than Ian McDiarmid, AKA Senator Palpatine/The Emperor. Then about 3/4 of the way through the film, there's a scene that, without giving anything away, looks like a straight take-off of a famous TPM scene involving Darth Maul, only in this case it's the ""Headless Horseman"". THEN I find out that the stunt double for the Horseman is none other than Ray Park, AKA Darth Maul! Pretty odd stuff. Anybody know if it was intentional? Is Burton secretly a huge Star Wars fan?",Sleepy Hollow

On one hand, the plot, characters, and dialogue (basically, the script) were nothing special.  However, the acting, music, and cinematography were stunning.  Danny Elfman's score perfectly captured the mood of the film, and Johnny Depp was fantastic as always..but even more so.
And the cinematography...my God... Sleepy Hollow actually looks like it was painted instead of filmed.  Every wide angle shot and long shot in the film looks like a painting, and many of the close-ups look like portraits!

Sleepy Hollow should appeal to all fans of the dark and macabre alike, as well as anyone else with a morbid imagination. The scenes involving the horseman himself are simply stunning and while the plot hardly veers  from the predictable, still maintains your attention. Some scenes are positively dripping in blood which may not appeal to some tastes, but it never gives the impression of being over the top.  Top all this off with dazzling SFX, plenty of laughs and fine direction, Sleepy Hollow adds up to a pretty good film.  There are times when I felt Ricci and Depp lacked chemistry and come the ending you may feel it's just another slasher movie, however there's no denying it's all been done with a sense of style.",Sleepy Hollow

I found it to be choppy, the characters unbelievable and lacking depth, and also the style and production excedingly unoriginal. It seemed to me, at many times during the film, to be no different from many of the other special effects laden products from the movie factories of Hollywood. There were indeed moments of that Tim Burton sparkle, that was lended so perfectly in gems such as Beatlejuice or Edward ScissorHands. In Sleepy Hallow, I also found a definite lack of atmosphere that in Burton´s other films was so integral and special. It was not the alternative reality of some time-caught present, with emblems of the glory days of post world war II America, for example. Nor was it a detail laden representation of some imagined time. The reality that he presents is far more story-tale like, yet, in a way that lacks the feeling of a true altenrate reality, lacks the feeling of trully being in the reality of the tale. Nor did Danny Elfman´s accompanying music have the elevating and moving quality as in other Burton films, nor was it as memorable. So, it is with all this in mind that I warn those who are to see it to do so without expcetations of films past.  And to those who have seen it, to go to the local video store and re-watch some of the Burton classics.",Sleepy Hollow

There's something for everyone:  Johnny Depp for the girls, Christina Ricci for the fellas (even though she doesn't do much in the way of acting), heads flying left and right, atmospheric music, great special effects and the gloomy set design of Sleepy Hollow itself.

The plot had a few holes, and the suspense was never very thick for me, but I must admit, I hadn't solved the crime until the last piece of the puzzle was put into place.  The acting was fit, and the writing had no noticeable weaknesses, but the star is the production.

The actors were great, too, especially Mr. Depp and Christina Ricci. But, unfortunately, there are many bad things that can be said about the movie. The first bad thing is the story. It might be true that everyone in the United States knows the story, but we here in Germany or even Western Europe don't know it. That's why I personally had problems with following the story: Who murdered who, the scenes in which Crane explains this are much too short, while the action scenes, especially those at the end, are much too long. SPOILER! And I really think that the idea that the stepmother controls the hessian horseman to kill this other family is a bit weird. The worst thing about the movie is, that it can't be put in any genre. This might be good sometimes, but here it isn't.

And it wasn't really a Whodunit, as i expected it to be (I didn't know the story, as told above). well, after all, some scenes were really great, SPOILER! for example when Crane finds his mother, so after all I give this movie 7 / 10 points.",Sleepy Hollow

Cristina Ricci did a fine job of portraying Katrina Van Tassel but she didn't really seem like she was interested in what was going on in the movie.

Though the story has been changed somewhat from the original Washington Irving's story, the tale's suspense is kept in tack. Burton's rich cinematography creates an atmosphere that keeps the movie goer on the edge of their seat.  The ""gore"" is kept to a minimum and very much in keeping with the story.

762,Dartmoor,WOW! The most fascinating movie I EVER SAW!!,10,4 August 2000,"(Warning: this ""might"" contain spoilers..) Tim Burton again proved himself an extremely creative director through this movie, which- I think- the best among all his work. With the exception of the rushed exposition of the events, everything in the movie was excellent. While watching the movie,I was first fascinated by the marvellous music of Danny Elfman during the scene in which Van Garret was completing his will. Actually, the music was so impressive throughout the movie that in some scenes, you feel suspense not because of the scene but because of the music (e.g. the scene in which the doctor, notary, magistrate Philips and Reverend Steenwyck was discussing among themselves,etc..) Then, I was again fascinated- this time by the magnificient cinematography (  every time gloomy and colorless; causing us to feel the fear of death ) created by Emmanuel Lubezki, who won numerous awards by his great work in Sleepy Hollow. However, he could not win the Academy Award although he was one of the five nominees, and ""American Beauty's"" winning the Oscar for the best cinematography is - I think- one of the biggest mistakes in the 72-year-history of Academy Awards!! Moreover, the casting was wonderful- perhaps the greatest of this year. The only problem was that Christina Ricci could have played more enthusiastically, but that is all; everything else about the cast was perfect or nearly so. I especially loved Christopher Walken as the Hessian horseman, yelling cruelly every time. Also, the makeup was so great that he seemed much more horrible than any of the characters in ""Hammer"" horror films. Besides, Johnny Depp's performance as ""Ichabod Crane"" and Miranda Richardson's both as ""Lady Van Tassel"" and ""The Western Woods Crone"" were really outstanding. Also, it was a nice surprise to see Christopher Lee, one of the biggest stars of ""Hammer"" horror films,in this movie. Though short, his performance as the burgomaster was absolutely impressive,adding much in the beginning to the moody atmosphere of the movie. Finally, the story was extremely breathtaking; no chance to get bored!!!! Perhaps, this was the greatest movie of this year!! 10 out of 10!",Sleepy Hollow

The story is great...i like that it's based on a legend. Tim Burton is a great director, just as great as Steven Spielberg. I mean every movie with Johnny Depp is great...he is a fantastic actor. He can be whoever he wants to be...he can speak softly and he can speak hard...he can make funny faces (like in Sleepy Hollow or Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) or he can be really serious (From Hell).

767,FeelGoodHit-OfTheSummer,My Favourite Film Of All Time,10,30 May 2006,"While it may not be a direct book adaptation, it certainly is a brilliant one. Tim Burton was quite possibly born to bring this Gothic tale to the big screen, and of course, Johnny Depp fits into the role perfectly.i remember being about 12 when this came out and unable to see it, so i asked people who had seen it for a detailed description of what happened. All the trailers i saw and the pictures from Empire and Total Film magazines had be determined to get it as soon as possible. i even stole it from blockbuster when it came out LOL.Visually this film is stunning. The western woods are so well made, i actually feel claustrophobic looking at them. The tree and the lair of the crone add to the Gothic and even the fully built town its fascinating to look at.Acting wise Burton could not of managed to get a better cast, including Michael Gambon, who was brought to my attention because of this film as well as Miranda Richardson. Some of Burton regulars appear such as Jeffrey Jones, Michael Gough and of course Johnny Depp. Each character have their own weird little traits and have a hint of the old hammer horror 'hammy' acting.A huge part in creating the atmosphere comes from, in my opinion, Danny Elfmans greatest score he has every done, but Tims direction and style of film making make this film what it is.",Sleepy Hollow
768,belgaum,error in chronology in 'Sleepy Hollow',7,8 August 2006,"The Third Christian Millennium, by which we in the west reckon time, began on January 1, 2001. There was much debate at the time that the former Millennium ended with 1999 and began with January 1 2000 - this was wrong and this erroneous thinking was reflected in the movie 'Sleepy Hollow', which was set in 1799.The character of Crane mentioned that the old century had ended when January 1 1800 began. At this moment in time the old century, the 18th, had one more year to run.Roman Centurions, as the title states, commanded 100, not 99 persons. We are not one year old until we have lived a full 365 days after our birth - until then we are just living a time span.Centuries end at the completion of the hundredth year, not the 99th and thus 1799 was not the last year of the 18th Century.Roger DESHON - 07 3 824 2981 Australia",Sleepy Hollow

The gruesome-ness of some of the scenes (decapitiaton etc etc) are great to watch, and when watching it now it still scares me now but makes me chuckle a bit also! Johnny Depps performance is great! he really hadpulled out everything to pull off the scaredy cat Icabod Crane, though its not his best performance (Edward Scissorhands is his best performance) he perfects the character more than anyone else could.This film is Burton at his most Gothic and horrific! he takes out his usual doses of fantasy and replaces it with decapitiatons etc etc! and pulls it off brilliantly!

If it is indeed the Hudson River, then why does the Hudson River appear on the right side of his carriage instead of on his left side? I'm sure Ichabod didn't cross into New Jersey to travel to Sleepy Hollow! Not in 1799! Other than this one obvious mistake, I rather enjoyed the flick and intend on re-reading the book when I get a moment to do so. I have always enjoyed Tim Burton's films and hope to do so in the future. Plus, I can't wait to see the next Johnny Depp/Tim Burton masterpiece.

774,Vanderlay,Washington Irving would roll in his grave,1,13 May 2002,"Having grown up IN the ORIGINAL Sleepy Hollow I've walked down the streets and through the graveyard. I've seen the landmarks a dozen times, toured Washington Irving's home, and read his original work more time then I can remember. As usual, the powers that be have taken a piece of literature and so twisted the story around that for all intents and purposes ""Sleepy Hollow"" is a completely differant story then it was. To start out with, the entire look and landscape is almost completely differant then the actual area. It is much spookier, darker, and stranger then anywhere around here that I know of. In actuality the area is actually quite pretty, sitting right on the Hudson river with only the occasional fog and rain. Second of all, the Headless Horseman never had an axe, nor did he decapitate his victims, nor did he even HAVE any victims. The original story depicts the Headless Horseman as a story, a myth, a legend of which there is no real evidence to back up his existence. Bodies were not found all over the area and the towns people were not genuinely frightened by his supposed presence. Perhaps the biggest mistake made is that of Johnny Depp's character, ""Constable Crane?"" Where did THAT one come from? Read the original story and Ichabod Crane is a clumsy, bumbling school teacher that is sent to the town as just that, a teacher. Depp's character is more reminiscent of a Van Damme or Stallone-type action hero then Irving's original character.In and of itself the movie is well done, Tim Burton chalks up another point for his visual imagery and all of the actors do their jobs well, particularly Depp, Walken, and Ricci. The only problem that remains is that again, a studio has taken a masterful story and butchered it in to a more gruesome, bloody, and differant story than it was back when Washington Irving first scribed it. Finding a copy of Irving's original text is not difficult, I urge anyone who has seen this movie to read the work and then make up your mind.",Sleepy Hollow

780,nickmalatia,A great movie for a Saturday night at home,9,27 July 2009,"Sleepy Hollow is the third collaboration between Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. Depp plays Ichabod Crane in a NYC police officer in 1799. He gets sent on leave for speaking out in court to a place called Sleepy Hollow, a creepy little town in upstate New York. While there, he investigates a series of gruesome be-headings. The townsfolk say it is the work of the Headless Horseman, a Hessian mercenary who was killed in the winter in '79 and is brought back from the grave for vengeful purposes. Depp is great at putting up a stoic front for someone who is essentially....a sissy. Christina Ricci is also quite good in the film, but one of the down points of the movie was her annoying accent. The movie doesn't skimp on dazzling effects and set pieces and the film is actually quite exciting. With Sleepy Hollow, Tim Burton has crafted a perfect horror movie for late night viewing. It can easily be enjoyed....aside from Ricci's accent. 8/10",Sleepy Hollow

If you enjoy Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, or just a movie that gets into your subconscious, this is a definite pick!",Sleepy Hollow
783,olirose1517,Beautifully Tim Burton,10,5 June 2012,"When I first watched this film I had some apprehensions that it would be the same a Sweeney Todd which, although Sweeney Todd is one of my favourite movies, would have been dull and repetitive. Sleepy Hollow, however, was in my view, of an entirely different genre and feel altogether. The movie is dark and mysterious, as are most Tim Burton movies, and the colour palette of greys blacks and whites means it has a black and white movie feel, without being black and white. Suspense is high all the way through and it manages to be gory and scary in parts, without being unwatchable for a squeamish audience.The cast of this movie is superb despite the fact that there are few supporting characters and there are actors in the film like Christopher Walken who has no lines at all! Johnny Depp was perfect, as ever, and his portrayal of a determined yet fairly quiet man, haunted by his past was thoroughly believable and entertaining. Christina Ricci I felt in some scenes lacked emotional depth, but otherwise was well cast and I believe she has the perfect look for Katrina Van Tassel. Miranda Richardson is an actress who is often overlooked in films as she often plays a supporting role but I feel it is hard not to mention her. She just has such a ""Sleepy Hollow"" look about her that she blends perfectly into the background for the greater part of the movie and appears as a quiet and subdued lady of the house before turning to reveal the mass murderer underneath which I felt she pulled off flawlessly, she is brilliantly watchable, as always. Michael Gambon, though his accent throughout the film is British, still somehow manages to fit in with the people of Sleepy Hollow and the rest of the cast are all completely in character and capture the strange and eerie feel of the movie. Overall, the movie is brilliant. I have never heard a telling of the legend the same as this one and there are many references to early visual effects through the cardinal illusion and the lantern in the midwife's house. The town, forest and windmill, all constructed physically within 3 months gives it a rustic atmosphere and the use of mist, horses and coffins adds to the slightly Gothic allure of the overall piece. The acting is perfect, the set, music and story are ensnaring and the twists and turns in the plot had me guessing until the end. I would not give it 10/10 if I could find something negative about it.",Sleepy Hollow
784,louistrouve,"Not really scary, but so beautiful",8,19 October 2011,"One of the great movies of Tim Burton alongside Edward Scissorhands, it has very effective visual effects and is gorgeous. Beauty and atmosphere are everything in this film that creates a Gothic but convincing world for the person who watches the movie. In many ways, it is closer to poetry than to horror.Johnny Depp is as good as usual and the whole cast is of great quality. The only flaw of ""Sleepy Hollow"" is, of course, that it doesn't follow the story of the book of Washington Irving with very different characters and a completely different end... But only the most snobbish watchdogs of American culture will really be bothered by that. Everyone else will really enjoy this nearly perfect film.",Sleepy Hollow
785,jazztap64,Heads Will REALLY Roll!,9,7 April 2005,"Sleepy Hollow is one of my favorite movies for many reasons. I love the story of the Headless Horseman, and this new version of the classic tale is original and different. Tim Burton is an amazing director and has created a beautiful and haunting atmosphere. Although the movie is dark, it is very funny, and the two of these categories fit well together. This may appear to be a scary movie but, although there are some scary parts, you usually end up laughing at the end of these scenes. Johnny Depp gives a wonderful performance and is very comical. If you don't have any other reason to watch this movie, Johnny is the reason. The rest of the actors play their parts well and are enjoyable to watch. Danny Elfman is one of my favorite composers and with this movie he does a wonderful job adding to the emotion of the scenes. If you like darkly comical movies, you will like Sleepy Hollow.",Sleepy Hollow
786,paco347,Very enjoyable,10,11 March 2004,"This movie in my opinion was one of the best of 1999. I loved the whole idea of Tim Burton tweaking the story a little bit to make it his own. Johnny Depp is a delight as Ichabod Crane, he never seems to disappoint. If you are a lover for Pirates of the Caribbean Johnny Depp, then you will love his quirkyness in this movie. The movie is about the basic Sleepy Hollow story, except for a few Tim Burton twists, which make the film better. Had Burton followed the usual Sleepy Hollow formula, I don't believe that the film would have been as enjoyable as it is. He's one of the great storytellers of our time, and this film is another testament to that. The supporting cast is perfect, Christina Ricci is great as Catrina. And i won't ruin the suprise for others, but they couldn't have picked a better actor to play the Hessian himself. This movie is sure to be a favorite for movie lovers. It's just really fun to watch.",Sleepy Hollow
787,rosa-benjamin,Not Bad For The Era,5,12 November 2013,"Purchased this DVD for 2.99 used, so not a bad deal at all. Pretty solid horror film to boot. However. . .One of the problems with horror movies with blood and gore involved is that the audience is so used to the special effects these days that the shock value is no longer there. Therefore the strength of the plot becomes more important to retain the audiences attention for the duration of the movie.To this end Sleepy Hollow is a novel way of turning a ""slasher"" movie into a period slasher movie. The problem with this is that the villain ""or the suspense"" associated with the Headless horsemen loses its scare factor after about 20 mins into the film. After than it is the inevitable ending that you come to expect with the hero saving the day.Thats the problem I have with this movie, it promises so much yet you feel a little disappointed in the end that it never quite achieved what it set out to do.Johnny Depp is a little annoying as the bumbling constable whilst Christina Ricci's character is not developed enough. She seems to fit the bill perfectly for her character, but we never get to see that enough in the movie.As far as horror flicks go its not too bad. Maybe I have just come to expect more in a storyline these days.",Sleepy Hollow
788,vid-kasic,"Hm, could have been better",6,26 September 2013,"Movie has some fun parts and nice idea's but overall I don like it. Now question is why? I had feeling that scenes are not connected, as if they had been cut off (part where man is siting in tower and watching on the field, you hear shot and next scene he is running in the forest), acting is a bit shallow, and overall idea was badly executed. It would be better if we had more time to get to know characters that were beheaded. Now i know this is horror movie but its always better if character who dies has some background. Atmosphere is a bit stretched, like there always has to be fog in unrealistic forest, I actually don't know how to describe feeling that i got form outdoor scenes in movie. What do I like. CGI is really good especially near the end of the movie when raider puts skull back on his neck. I must say i was impressed by that scene. Fun part was when Crane was hit in the head with pumpkin. And these are all memorable scenes for me.It is not on my list of must watch movies but if you are looking for something to ""kill"" some time then feel free to watch Sleepy Hollow, but don't watch with too much expectations, like me, you will probably get disappointed.",Sleepy Hollow
789,superhasek,"Trite plot, but great visual experience",6,25 August 2006,"This film is a good example of how a movie can work even when its plot is sub par or lacking substance (Terrence Malick's The New World also comes to mind). The score, cinematography, and art direction are all superb, but the main plot is rather unoriginal and uninspired. The film piques your interest from the start but eventually devolves into a standard murder mystery. Yet in the end, the film remains a thoroughly enjoyable experience, if only for its sensory value.Tim Burton successfully creates a hauntingly beautiful Gothic setting in post-independence America, with many memorable dark scenes that will be sure to tickle your macabre fancies. Ichabod Crane's back-story is particularly disturbing yet simultaneously fascinating. The contrast between light and dark is intentionally stark, and it helps create the supernatural setting. The town of Sleepy Hollow has an uneasy feel about it, as expected, but interestingly enough, Burton's portrayal of New York is even more harrowing. The city is shown as a sort of puritanical version of Gotham, which is of course Burton's bread and butter.The film has a remarkable cast, and most of the actors turn in excellent performances. Johnny Depp is brilliant as usual, and he truly becomes the methodical Ichabod Crane who is haunted by a dark past. Christina Ricci is quite believable in her role as the down to earth and sensible Katrina Van Tassel. Miranda Richardson is the only real weak link in the cast, as her performance seems over the top and contrived. Also be ready for a let down if you are a Christopher Walken fan, as I am; though he is magnificently terrifying as the Horseman, he does not get much screen time at all. (The Horseman is headless after all--I just wish the writers could have found a way around this small detail.) This movie is a must for all Tim Burton fans. If you don't particularly care for his work however, and if you absolutely need a strong plot to interest you in a movie, you may want to pass on this film. But if you're looking for a visually stunning and creative piece of fantasy, Sleepy Hollow will not disappoint.",Sleepy Hollow
790,chaitunv,Hats off to Tim Burton!!,10,12 December 2004,"i was not a Tim Burton fan before i watched ""Sleepy Hollow"" but i became one immediately after. I have seen his Batman and liked it, but I don't think its better than SleepyHollow in any way. The eerieness, the suspense, the narration are in no way inferior to any of Burton's previous movies ( not to mention Danny Elfman's haunting score). I would say SH is the best of TimBurton's lot and one of my favourites.The best thing about the movie is, you never suspect that the horseman is a ghost until you are more than halfway through the movie. All appearances of the horseman are excellently choreographed.I especially liked the scene where the watch guard(Masebeth Sr.) is killed. The ending was not perfect but it was good.

Suddenly, he arrived in 1999 with Sleepy Hollow, a horror movie with Johnny Depp (my all-time favourite) and Christina Ricci. And I can tell you... This movie changed my life. It is thanks to this movie I wanted to roll in the moviebussiness myself. Not long after I saw the movie, I bought a camera and began filming. And I am still filming. Thanks to Tim Burton and the great Power this movie has over me! Are there any of you who feel the same? Don't you get the chills when you see Christopher Walken with his pointy teeth and don't you feel surprised when you know who is controlling the Horseman?

792,temuraga,Very successful filming of a nice horror story.,9,6 March 2005,"Before watching this movie, you should keep in mind that what Tim Burton likes and always tries to do is telling stories somewhat reminding of fairy tales. He likes to act like a ""storyteller"". Therefore, you should not take the story very seriously. For if you do, you will not understand what the movie really tells about.Sleepy Hollow is based on an English folk story about the curse of some killed warrior. Burton's filming of the story is really excellent, for the story is a really short one. Making it a long and whole film with no disturbing extras must have been a really hard job. Burton has perfectly overcome this difficulty. The natural and still thrilling atmosphere is another success of the director. He felt no need to special effects, mostly thanks to his efficient and affective use of the camera. This way, a fairy tale looks like a real story.The actings of Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci have contributed to the atmosphere to a great extent, as well: It is a horror story, yet we see no over-acting by the two leading characters. Christina's mimic-less face has been subject to criticism, but the fact that we do not know whether Katrina is good or evil is mostly thanks to that mimic-less face. Thus we see a really good acting, I think.The one problem of the movie is its editing. It looks like made in a hurry. But it does not harm the wholeness of the movie.",Sleepy Hollow
793,despil,Crap...,3,17 August 2005,"This movie was boring, predictable, and generally bad. Though I liked Johnny Depp.All in all, I think it was an unnecessary addition to the world of movie. And I still don't know what the movie wanted to say. A new age detective is out to prove his methods work all right, but he does not show it, in fact it has nothing to do with the whole story - not that there was too much story there. Just some hack and slash and in the end buck some lucky twist of fate the guy saves the day.Really, was it that necessary to shoot it??And what is this 10 line limit on comments? Do I have to write an essay on the movie?? Get serious....",Sleepy Hollow
794,hdj7,A great movie if you are able to leave your brain at the door,8,11 October 2005,"I should start out by saying that I'm a fan of Tim Burton, Johnny Depp, and Christina Ricci which will have an impact on my review.The first time I saw this in theaters, I was disappointed because I expected more from the talent involved; it was a movie of atmosphere over substance. Furthermore, it wasn't really a horror movie despite its gore and suspense. But, I decided to give it another chance when I wanted to just watch something entertaining and found to have come to appreciate it more and more with each viewing. On long days when I just want to stop thinking for awhile, I will put it into the DVD player and enjoy the ride from beginning to end.Nevertheless, this movie will appeal only to a select audience of people who can judge the film for what it is: a mindless suspense film with a brooding atmosphere and a good amount of charm. So on an October night, when you have come home from a long day of work, this just might be the perfect movie to sit down and escape reality.",Sleepy Hollow
795,djroars,A Missed Opportunity,4,26 October 2011,"I'm glad to see there are at least a few kindred spirits out there who were also disappointed by this movie, but far fewer than anticipated. After watching I honestly expected to come to the IMDb page and see a rather low rating and a page full of reviews wondering just what in the sam hill Burton was thinking.To be fair, I grew up loving The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, especially the impeccable Rabbit Ears version narrated by Glenn Close. Still, while I certainly knew this was going to take liberties with the story, I had no idea just how many, and how drastic they'd be. And please don't tell me I should have expected this because Burton's been doing it for years. I've seen plenty of Burton movies before, not all of them are dark slightly humorous Gothic macabre slashers. For every Sweeney Todd (which obviously is similar to this, but so is it's source material), there's a Big Fish.I knew the Horseman was actually going to be a killer, that wasn't a surprise. But the first shock came when we go to New York City. Ichabod Crane is a Renaissance inspired constable? Are you kidding me? The guy's supposed to be a timid bean-pole of a traveling school teacher. Whatever, roll with the punches I told myself.Cut to Sleepy Hollow. Hmm, I notice there isn't any sunlight for the third scene in a row, I have a feeling it's going to be like this for the rest of the movie (suspicion later confirmed). Are we really going to pretend it's always cloudy just to set the mood? I hate it when people use techniques like that; if you can't create an oppressive gloomy atmosphere without washing the color and light out of everything don't bother. For a particular scene? Sure, but I know you can do it without easy tricks like that Burton. And of course in the very last happy 15 second scene in NYC the sun is shining bright; ""how symbolic!"" I cried with the utmost sarcasm.Next we were introduced to the Horseman himself via flashback. I'll not beat around the bush, I hated this depiction of the horseman. A superhuman Christopher Walken with the hair of a 17 year old snowboarder and freaking fangs? He looked like a strung out Troll Doll going through withdrawal. I won't deny I chuckled, Walken always amuses me and I figured this would be the only time we saw him since there is no actual ghost. I assumed Burton was just having a little fun with a one-off exaggerated flashback. I was mistaken.When it turned into murder mystery mode, I did begin to enjoy it again for a time. Once it became clear there were actually supernatural forces at work though, that the killer wasn't one of the townsfolk (not directly anyway), I'd just about had enough. The entire original story is about how people get freaked about by old wives tales when they're combined with spooky atmospheres, even though it's all fake, but now not only is the horseman actually killing people, he's actually a ghost too? As Cris Carter would say, ""C'mon man!"" None of this is to mention the dreadfully unnecessary and rather hokey special effects. In addition to all of the mind numbingly gratuitous beheadings (and seriously what was the point? We get it, you're not afraid to show some gore. It gets boring after the seventh time) there's also the completely random scene with a witch wigging out while acting as a medium. Did Sam Raimi stop by the set for a day? And while we're on the witches, whose bright idea was it to make Katrina an amateur sorcerer? So random. And the reason for the minister betraying his friend's trust is that he sacrifices his beliefs for lust with a witch? Where did you buy your book of clichés Tim?Oh well, I've certainly seen worse movies, but what a let down. I was very excited to finally see this, an esteemed director adapting one of my favorite childhood stories in a big screen treatment. He turned it from a delightful spooky little yarn about post-colonial America into a ridiculous over the top fantasy film about a serial killer chock full of cheesy effects.",Sleepy Hollow
796,xx_pinkbunny_xx,sleepy hollow is brilliant,10,30 July 2005,"sleepy hollow is a truly brilliant film, there are lots of twists and turns which are guaranteed to keep you on your feet. I was most impressed when seeing it for the first time. As Johnny Depp is in it that is an added bonus most definitely. He is gifted with being able to take on lots of very different roles and there is no better actor then Johnny for doing voices. His character in Sleepy Hollow is certainly nothing like any role he's taken before. The special effects are excellent they all look very realistic. All Tim Burtons films have that magical thing about them, they are all very different to your average movie and are most definitely worth seeing, I would give Sleepy Hollow 10/10 and if you have not seen it already you are missing out because its a must see.",Sleepy Hollow
797,amlkittie,Tim Burton outdid himself again with this awesome movie,10,8 August 2005,Tim Burton outdid himself again with sleepy hollow a movie you won't forget well it starts out with Ichabod crane going to sleepy hollow to figure out the murderer of many killings well there's a lot of stuff but today i feel the rating should be pg-13 i think the only reason it was rated r was because a very umm sexual scene it is not what i would call scary i've got more screams out of the grudge than sleepy hollow but i will never forget one thing those piercing blue eyes of the headless horseman's a shade of blue i doubt i will see in really life those eyes just put shivers down my spin but i recommend you to see it i enjoyed it and i know you will too,Sleepy Hollow
798,lewkovich-1,A great viewing experience,10,20 October 2005,"A well chosen cast with the perfect director for this horror-fairy tale. The bits of intended humor work well and the fog bound, darkened world reminds one of classic images from our younger days. Burton, Depp and the director of photography all deserve awards for outstanding work in a genre that appeared exhausted prior to this retelling. This film is so visually rich and the characters so solidly visualized that one can easily watch this entire film with the sound off and still come away fulfilled. The little town of Sleepy Hollow with its unique and isolated inhabitants are part of a dark secret that the inspector (Johnny Depp) must flush out in his nervous/edgy manner. Mr. Depp's ability to so perfectly perform his role without stealing the show is a testament to his ability and character. This movie sets such high standards that this story will probably not be retold in by Hollywood for many a decade.",Sleepy Hollow
799,zarakino,"Good movie even if it doesn't follow Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow""",9,29 October 2006,"Spoiler note: they are slight, might not even been significant, but they are here, both spoilers for the movie and the short story.For me a Tim Burton directing plus Danny Elfman for music equals an excellent film, add on three of my favorite actors, Johnny Depp, Christina Ricci, and Christiohor Walken and that just makes a mind blowing film. So naturally I do enjoy this film very much. The sets are fantastic and true to Burton form the music wonderfully eerie. There's only one problem...it doesn't follow Washington Irving's ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" at all.These are all the BIG differences: First things first, Ichabod is a schoolteacher in the book, he is also full of himself, pompous and well lets face it, ugly. He wants to marry Katrina so that he can inherit her dad's estate and then sell it for profit.Second, Brom Bones is the headless horseman, he is jealous of Ichabod spending time with Katrina and wants to chase him out of town. He does a very nice job of it two. Ichabod never returns to the area.Third, okay this is a bit nit picky, but that big gnarly tree has to do with another legend mentioned in the story. The horseman comes out of the church graveyard.The movie is great for what it is, but unfortunately Disney did a better job of putting the real tale on film. I won't discourage anyone from watching the movie, just don't watch it to get out of reading the story. In fact I encourage everyone to read ""The Legend of Sleepy Hollow"" by Washington Irving!",Sleepy Hollow
800,Actness,"Great fantasy, horror movie!",10,14 March 2006,"This, is probably one of the few Tim Burton films I actually like. But it is such a good movie in my opinion! It's just cool, because it's like a fairy-tale, and horror movie put together. And I like it how they didn't use the original story of Sleepy Hollow. Instead, they used the basics, but sort of made there own story.It starts out with Constable Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) who has a mission to go to Sleepy Hollow, to solve the mystery of ""someone"" killing people, by chopping peoples heads off. While Ichabod is there, he meets the young, and pretty, Katrina Van Tassel (Christina Ricci), who he starts to soon fancy. Later, he finds out that it is not just some mortal killing people, but instead the living dead of ""The Headless Horseman""! One by one, important people of the small village are killed. Ichabod has to find out how to stop the Horseman soon, or more people, maybe even him, will be killed! You will have to watch and see what happens! This movie has a pretty good twist ending too (And not a bad/disappointing one either). But I warn you, this movie is very gory, because it shows the heads actually being cut off.I suggest this movie to any horror fan. I would also rate this film a 10/10. But don't take my word, witness it yourself ;-)",Sleepy Hollow
801,CRoooKZ,is sleepy hollow a true story?,10,24 November 2005,"yes indeed the movie sleepy hollow is one hundred percent based on a true story and all the names and places are all real, in fact the village where the movie was filmed is the exact village where the horseman committed all of his murders. And then placed the heads of the victims in a hollow tree. That same tree is still standing in the village in England to this day. Some people even say when you visit the village or even the tree you can still smell the rotting heads and the blood which is stained the bark of the tree. This is believed because it is said that the hollow tree is the gateway to hell where the horseman we sent to after he was beheaded.",Sleepy Hollow
802,cckeeney1,great!,9,17 December 2005,"This movie is well put together. The director did a superb job. The overall feeling of the movie is gloomy and mysterious. This movie also has a love story. (everyone likes a love story) Although it is horror...there is comedy. The comedy is well suited for this particular film. The horror is not unbearable just a little creepy and a little gruesome at times, nothing I couldn't handle. However, if you don't like blood and open necks, don't watch this movie. I also find Miranda Richardson to play a wonderful performance as well as Johnny Depp. In my opinion they stole the film. I personally loved it. It is a magical story that should be passed down forever. I highly recommend it.",Sleepy Hollow

804,omrilion,Sleepy Hollow,10,29 September 2006,"This fantasy captures the essence of American folklore using the charms of Burton's film-making. Subtle and nuanced in its approach to the genre, and yet wonderfully horrific at times this flick shines with creativity unlike any film of its type in the past ten years. For those film buffs who have had their fill of sub-par filler fantasy this movie will whisk you away to a mindset you had far forgotten you possessed. All performances throughout the duration of the film where stellar and it is quite easy to tell that this cast (each chosen wisely for their role) where enjoying this film as much making it as I was watching it, which adds hugely to the film's appeal. Extending to an even broader audience this movie puts a heavy importance on its cinematography which casts itself as a narrator that not only introspectively delves into its scenes, but transports the viewer deeper and deeper into this world. Definitely a must see for those of us left with a little imagination and a yearning for out of the ordinary.",Sleepy Hollow
