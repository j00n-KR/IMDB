0,MartinHafer,Good but #27?! I just don't get it.,7,29 July 2015,"I wish I'd never seen that ""Leon: The Professional"" was rated #27 on IMDb. With an outrageously high score like this, I get my expectations too high--way too high. Now I am not saying it's a bad film but it's certainly not THAT good. In fact, it's not among writer/director Luc Besson's best (""The Fifth Element"" and ""La Femme Nikita"" are definitely better). Why is it rated so highly? The film stars Jean Reno as a top ninja-like assassin. However, in an odd twist, this lone wolf killer falls in with a girl (Natalie Portman) and he becomes her foster dad. This is hard to believe but even harder to believe is his training her to be a killer as well as he going after the baddie lone wolf style! And, speaking of the baddie, Gary Oldman pretty much plays the same guy he played in ""The Fifth Element"". Saying the film has some ridiculously difficult to believe aspects is certainly an understatement. Now I am not saying it's bad...but it cannot be a great film, in my opinion, if so much of it is difficult to believe. Interesting, yes....top 100...no way.By the way, I think it's safe to assume that Portman was named Mathilda in the film because of her and her family's strong similarity to the characters in the Raold Dahl book ""Matilda"".",Léon - The Professional
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Intense, gripping, stylish and poignant with one of the best feature debuts ever",10,4 June 2011,"Luc Besson's film Leon:The Professional is a superb one. Visually, it is very stylish, with striking location work, atmospheric lighting and really authentic and bold cinematography. The soundtrack also does very well in enhancing the mood of each scene, and Besson's direction is faultless.There is also a gripping story with well crafted characters particularly Mathilda and Jean Reno's character Leon, a cracking script and crisp pacing and while there are some over-the-top and intense moments particularly with Stansfield and the beginning, particularly as the chemistry between Mathilda and Leon expands there are some poignant ones too.The acting is excellent. Jean Reno is charismatic and commanding in the title role while Gary Oldman is wildly bombastic as Stansfield. But I was especially impressed by Natalie Portman, who delivers one of the best and most captivating feature debuts ever. In conclusion, a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Léon - The Professional
2,Leofwine_draca,Besson's masterpiece - action cinema with real heart,10,16 August 2016,"Despite having a mainly American cast and being set on the rough streets of New York, this is very much a French film, evident from the crew list at the end of the film. I'm always one to give foreign film-makers a try, as they usually offer up something a little bit more stylish and different than the usual formula. Take Lucio Fulci with his trademark 'hard' and nightmarish horror films, Dario Argento with his gory yet stylistic giallo films, or John Woo's violent, ballet-like action films.Luc Besson doesn't disappoint with this film, offering us his typical lashings of wit, and drawing charisma and charm from his cast. While THE FIFTH ELEMENT bordered on being silly in places, it was still a fun science fiction film, and kudos to the man for experimenting with different genres. LEON is probably the first film that brought him to the typical American's attention, and I would say deservedly so. While masquerading as a typical action-filled gun fest, it is in fact a film of three parts. The beginning is packed with horrible, unflinching violence from killers who don't have the slightest feeling of remorse - Jean Reno expertly massacres a squad of bodyguards, while Gary Oldman shotguns children and people in the bath. The middle of the film is more like a conventional drama, and it tells the story of Leon, the hit-man, and Mathilda, the young orphaned victim, and their growing love for one another which draws the human side of Leon out of his impassive shell. The ending is indeed all out action.All parts of the film are great, and Besson frequently shows his American contemporaries how it should be done. As the box says, it is extremely hard-hitting at the beginning, with deaths shown in all their bloody impact. The ending is also brilliant, with a SWAT team laying siege to Leon's apartment; this is non-stop, violent action and easily rivals any blockbuster like FACE/OFF. However, the film's main triumph is that it really makes us care about the two central characters, thanks to the script, Besson, and of course the actors involved.This is the film that really made Jean Reno something of a star. He's great as the Bruce Willis-like ageing hero, even if he does mercilessly kill people. Natalie Portman is also likable as the child who is old beyond her years, and almost unrecognisable from the bland role she played in STAR WARS. The villain is a drug-taking maniac, brilliantly played with startling intensity by Gary Oldman, who frequently shows his competitors how it should be done. LEON may be sentimental, but this sentiment slowly grows from the start and is realistic and believable, it is not shoved down our throats. Also, check out the ending, which manages to be very good and fitting, and yet sad at the same time. It will make you yell and cry in equal measure.",Léon - The Professional
3,SnoopyStyle,Luc Besson style of violent action,8,7 August 2014,"Léon (Jean Reno) is a milk-drinking illiterate hit-man for Italian mob boss Uncle Tony (Danny Aiello) in NYC with his favorite plant. His next door neighbor 12 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman) has an abusive father (Michael Badalucco) who skimmed drugs off of Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Stansfield massacres the family. She comes home to find Stansfield's men still there. She fakes and walks over to Léon's. It turns out that they are corrupt DEA agents. Léon the cleaner reluctantly lets her in and she badgers him to teach her. She seeks revenge on his little brother's murderers.Director Luc Besson brings his often collaborator Jean Reno to America and makes a nice discovery with a young Natalie Portman. Before Hit-Girl, there was Mathilda. Gary Oldman is a superb strange bad guy. Luc Besson has a certain French flair with his action. He really has a unique take on the action thriller genre. It definitely has an edgy violent style that sometimes sexualized the young Portman. She takes on a lot of adult tendencies. That probably held it back a little back in the day.",Léon - The Professional
4,Horst_In_Translation,Great film with one of the most memorable duos in film history,8,14 December 2014,"""Lèon"" is a 1994 movie written and directed by Luc Besson and named after its central character played by Jean Reno. The film went almost completely under the radar in terms of awards recognition outside of France, but its reputation steadily rose over the years and it is now pretty much considered a classic. Besson was in his mid-30s when he made this movie, but already had a respectable résumé including a French and English version of ""Nikita"". For Reno and Oldman this is probably still the most famous work (not counting Oldman's efforts in the Batman movies) and for Portman it goes right along with other blockbusters like ""V for Vendetta"" and ""Black Swan"", which gave her the Oscar. I am still a bit disappointed Reno was not present at the ceremony. For Portman, Mathilda was the first role in a movie. Also in the film is Danny Aiello as a friend to Léon. His role wasn't clear early on to me as it seemed unsure what he was doing with the money, but as the film went on it showed that he was pretty close to Léon.The film begins with an introduction of what Léon does. He is a contract killer, who, in fact only wants a little talk as we find out in the first sequence. The way he disappears into the dark is pretty cool. What is a more sad than cool is the one scene where Léon's loneliness is displayed. However, when we see him in the theater he does not seem to mind at all. His face expression while watching the movie is so much fun. He is also a milk junkie (just like myself). Sadly, I got no little girl that brings all this milk to me. There are many cult references closely connected with this film: the shades, the long coat, the piggy, the plant (rootless like Léon, nice quote), the chewing gum trick... After the intro, Portman and Oldman (character name Stansfield, a pill-popping Beethoven-listening psychopath cop) pretty much enter the film at the same time. Oldman's character is really scary, even his colleagues fear him. If you listen closely, Matilda's dad only dares to shout at Stansfield's partner Malky, not at him. The fact that Oldman is not physically intimidating at all makes him even scarier as he must be a complete nutcase if people three times his size fear him. Another little snippet: One of the actors who play Stansfield's helpers died during the terrorist attacks on 9/11 during his work as a firefighter seven years after the movie. When Mathilda's family is killed, the writers already gave it their best to make them look as unlikeable as possible being very violent to their daughter/sister, except the very small one of course. It's pretty sad when Mathilda describes him as a kid who only wanted to cuddle. However, we also find out that her dad paid a tuition fee for one year in advance, so he can't be all bad. I wondered about Oldman's character why the internal commission isn't getting worried if so many people that cross his way keep dying.One of my favorite scenes from the film is when Mathilda returns with the milk, hears her family is dead and knocks on Léon's door. Very intense moment with her begging going against his principles. Finally he lets her in, physically and mentally into his life. He becomes her mentor, she becomes his housewife and quickly develops some sexual tension (quiz game for example or talk about virginity as well being at an age where girls start dating their classmates. She doesn't go to school, so there is no such possibility.) At the same time, Léon also turns into some kind of father figure to her. She looks up to him and also starts dressing more and more like him. Even if she seems very tough, there's a handful scenes where we see how immature and naive she really is, like when she tells the hotel worker that Léon is her lover or also her cartoon addiction or how she pours in the alcohol.The movie is at its most entertaining when the two go to work together. The scene with LaSardo (great actor) is pure gold and when they shoot the jogging politician from far away, it is also slightly special. Another funny comment by Léon is the ""hurry or he will never shut up"" after they run into gunshots. An emotional highlight is Mathilda's attempted suicide. She asks him what she is to him. He says nothing, yet contradicts himself by pulling the gun away in time. Almost a bit of a spoiler scene is when Léon tells Aiello's character to give Mathilda the money if something happens to him. One of the most intense scenes is when Stansfield and Mathilda meet in the bathroom. Edge-of-seat stuff and it shows that Stansfield is really scared of nothing, not even killing a girl in police headquarters. The possibly most beautiful camera shot of the film is when we see Léon and Mathilda reunited at one point and the camera shows us their feet. The last half hour is almost exclusively action sequences. I enjoyed these despite generally not being a great action movie fan. Maybe the reason is that you have made such a strong connection with the two protagonists at this point already. Oldman's way of handling the final act says a lot about him as well. He stays outside of the action to not put his own life in danger, but is a coward who prefers to shoot his victims in the back. When Léon hits the ground, it is a pretty sad moment (just like the farewell scene a couple minutes earlier) as we see it from his perspective. The film ends with Mathilda deciding to go back to school and a beautiful Sting song before the credits roll in.Wonderful movie, over two hours very much worth watching.",Léon - The Professional
5,claudio_carvalho,A Perfect Chemistry,10,7 December 2004,"In New York, León (Jean Reno) is an Italian professional hit-man, who loves drinking milk and has a plant as his best friend. His godfather and mentor is the mobster Tony (Danny Aiello), who loves León as if he were his own son, and his cold blood makes him a perfect killer. When Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his gang executes the family of his twelve years old neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman), León lodges the girl in his place, beginning a weird friendship between a killer and a confused girl wishing revenge. When Mathilda finds who Stansfield is, she presses León to kill him. 'León' is a wonderful movie, having one of the most perfect chemistry in the cinema between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. The storyline recalls some parts of John Cassavetes' 'Gloria', but the performances of the debutant Natalie Portman and the always-excellent Jean Reno upgrade this film. There are at least three scenes that I really love: the light on the corridor, when León opens the door for Mathilda; when they are walking together in a New York street, coming towards the camera; and when Stansfield hits León. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): 'O Profissional' ('The Professional')",Léon - The Professional
6,classicsoncall,"""I like these calm little moments before the storm"".",7,29 December 2008,"This film held my interest for exactly one hour. It was about at that point that Gary Oldman's character was revealed to be a cop, and then the head scratching began. I mean, really, did he and his goons have to take out Mathilda's whole family over a drug deal gone bad? And when Stansfield (Oldman) is questioned about the massacre, he storms out yelling that he doesn't have time for this spit? What police force allows it's own to go renegade like that without stepping in? Then you have Mathilda (Natalie Portman). OK, I know we're pushing our kids like never before into a maturity they can't handle, but come on. Was anything about Mathilda believable? I can understand her wanting to get revenge on the scum that killed her family, but she was more than ready to go out and target practice using live rounds on joggers in the park. Who comes up with this stuff? There was nothing remotely believable about anything that occurred in the second half of the story, especially after Leon (Jean Reno) wasted the two cops right inside police headquarters. After that, it all became too absurd for comprehension.So then I call up this flick's stats on the IMDb, and it sits at #35 in the Top 250 of all time! What's that all about? That's just a total perversion of any kind of integrity in the rating system. This film is an escapist action adventure flick where one's sense and rationality is best left checked at the door on the way in. To give it the kind of adulation that most of the reviewers here seem to bestow upon it just makes me wonder what we all have become. It's not pretty.",Léon - The Professional
7,gavin6942,One of the Greats of the 1990s,9,21 November 2014,"Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl, who is reluctantly taken in by Léon Montana (Jean Reno), a professional assassin, after her family is murdered. Léon and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the assassin's trade.This is what you get if you take ""Lolita"" (sort of) and put it in the middle of a world with mobsters and hit men. And then casting for perfect actors? Priceless. Luc Besson probably had no idea that Portman would go on to be the international sensation she has become.Of course, we also have a solid performance from the always-impeccable Gary Oldman. Very few actors are working on his level. Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis, possibly Christian Bale. But Gary Oldman can be anyone and delivers 100% every time.Roger Ebert gave the film only two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, ""Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action... In what is essentially an exercise—a slick urban thriller—it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it."" Not to disregard his concern, but time seems to be against Ebert here. The film has steadily gone up in praise over the years, possibly due to Portman's rising star.",Léon - The Professional
8,lee_eisenberg,"My introduction to Luc Besson, Jean Reno, and Natalie Portman.",7,18 March 2006,"I had never heard of Jean Reno when ""Leon"" (called ""The Professional"" in the United States) came out, but I was sure impressed with it. Featuring Reno as a hit-man who has to take teenager Mathilda (Natalie Portman) under his wing after a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman) murders her family, the movie is gritty - and sometimes a little gag-inducing - but an interesting look at the underworld.As for the people involved in it, Luc Besson later directed the super-cool ""Fifth Element"" and the misconceived ""Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc""; Jean Reno will probably make an interesting Bezu Fache in ""The Da Vinci Code""; Natalie Portman may be best known as Queen/Senator Amidala, but I prefer to remember her for ""Mars Attacks!"" (although it remains to be seen how she performs in ""V for Vendetta""). All in all, a really good movie.",Léon - The Professional
9,jboothmillard,Léon,8,15 January 2007,"From director Luc Besson (The Fifth Element), I remember seeing this film, also titled The Professional, once before, but I couldn't remember much about it, so I had to have a second viewing. Basically Leone 'Léon' Montana (Jean Reno) is the professional hit-man, or ""cleaner"", who only drinks milk, cares for a houseplant and loves Gene Kelly musicals, and he lives next to Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman) is the twelve year old New York girl living with her little Brother (Carl J. Matusovich) and her dysfunctional family. Mathilda's Father (Michael Badalucco) is being paid by corrupt DEA cops to store cocaine in his house, and when they find out he has been stealing some of it for himself, sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman 'Stan' Stansfield (Gary Oldman) leads his team of agents to kill him and his family. Mathilda managed to escape death going shopping, and Léon lets him into his apartment knowing she is all alone, and she eventually finds out his deadly profession, but she doesn't see this as a threat, but an opportunity. She is willing to pay him a fee he has mentioned to kill the people responsible for killing her family, well, specifically her brother, or teach her to use the weapons of his trade, so he does this. So Léon teaches her how to use many firearms, particularly a scoped rifle, and in return she does chores in the apartment and teaches him some skills he lacks, such as literacy, and in doing so she claims she is falling in love with him. One day, after learning what she thinks is enough to do the job herself, Mathilda takes a number of weapons in a bag to go and hunt Stansfield down, posing as an innocent delivery girl, but he ambushes her, until Léon arrives to take her away. After gaining the information of Léon's whereabouts from friend Tony (Danny Aiello), Stansfield gets a team of SWAT-like masked men to take Mathilda hostage and infiltrate the apartment, but Léon's skills get the better of them and he gets her back safely. She manages to escape going down an air shaft, and Léon looks like he is going to make his way out posing as one of the masked men with bad injuries, but Stansfield recognises him. The end sees Léon nearly getting away, but being shot by Stansfield, and blowing himself and the villain up with active grenades, and after being refused a hit-man existence, Mathilda tries to return to school, and she plants Léon's beloved plant in a field. Also starring Peter Appel as Malky, Ellen Greene as Mathilda's Mother and Elizabeth Regen as Mathilda's Sister. Reno gives a wonderful performance as the loner with all the skills, Oldman is great as a dark drug taking villain on the wrong side of the law, and young Portman almost steals the show as the girl wanting revenge, and obviously Reno and Portman together create sparks. It is an action filled film, with some funny moments, some dark, atmospheric and suspenseful moments, as well as touching moments with the title character and his female friend bonding, a must see thriller. Gary Oldman was number 40 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, and he was number 36 on The World's Greatest Actor. Very good!",Léon - The Professional
10,ccthemovieman-1,A Movie Of Extremes & Fascinating,9,21 October 2005,"This is one of the truly sick movies I own and am embarrassed to say how much I have always liked it....but I have, big-time. This film, with some very sick messages, is uniquely appealing at the same time. To use a popular word of today: it is ""extreme.""The extreme GOOD: 1 - A very different story and a fascinating profile of a strange, likable loner hit-man and a tough little girl and how they help each other soften the other's personality; 2 - A very intense drama at times with tremendous action scenes in the beginning and end, particularly the latter. 3 - The little girl ""Mathilda"" (Natalie Portman's first role) does of the best acting jobs I've ever seen for pre-teen child, and I've seen a number of good ones over the years. It is no surprise she has turned out to be a big star. 4 - Despite his profession, ""Leon"" (Jean Reno) is a very likable character and extremely contradictory, extolling admirable virtues to the little girl (no cursing, no smoking, choosing good friends, etc.) while at the same time teaching her how to shoot people and then using her as an accomplice to murders! Reno's voice is fun to listen to, really different from any other actor I've ever heard. 5 - Gary Oldman, as usual, is great at playing a whacked-out character. The more you watch this film, the more you appreciate his performance. 6 - A very satisfying ending; 7 - Great camera shots by director Luc Besson, who is known for some stylish movie-making.The extreme BAD: 1 - Not only does nice-guy Leon teach Mathilda how to shoot people but.... 2 - the latter (on the extended version) gets drunk and later wants Leon to make love to her ; 3 - Portman uses strong profanity throughout the film. I'm sorry, but a little girl doing and saying all of this is pretty sick! (What kind of parents, by the way, would allow their 11-year-old to play a role like this?) 4 - Another film that makes a killer into the good guy and the police into the bad guys. In the end, though, it's only a movie, just a fictional story and it's job is to entertain....and in that it succeeds amazingly well. Great entertainment in a perverse way.",Léon - The Professional
11,rmax304823,Smart Kid.,6,17 October 2011,"Natalie Portman, at twelve, is a smart, street-wise kid living in an shabby walk-up apartment with a dysfunctional family. Returning from an innocent trip to the grocery she finds that Gary Oldman and his goons have killed her entire family and are rummaging around, looking for some lost dope.Being a smart kid, Portman slowly carries her grocery bags past the open door to the blood-spattered room, past Oldman's lookout man who eyes her suspiciously, and when she reaches the end of the hallway, unable to walk farther, she presses the last doorbell. It doesn't open. The lookout is watching, his pistol in hand. She rings the bell again, whispering, ""Please open it."" Behind Door Number N is Jean Reno, a professional hit man, also with a drawn pistol, watching the goings on through a hole in the door. He works alone, ""no women, no kids"", doesn't want to be involved in somebody else's violence, and he knows the girl's situation.He opens the door and for him it's like opening Pandora's box. All sorts of irrelevant demands are placed on him and he's subject to threats that have nothing to do with his profession.Oldman discovers that Portman was missed in the slaughter and the gang begins its search for her and, ultimately, for him too. Portman smokes cigarettes, is cheeky, wants to learn how to kill people, and whispers to the manager of their new hotel that Reno is not really her father. He's her lover.The manager's expression is a little hard to read. Natalie Portman may be an underdeveloped twelve but she is angelic with her Louise Brooks hair cut and her black choker and her feline eyes and her plump lips. She's not the most convincing little actress in the business but what does it matter? Any normal man would be abnormal if he didn't want to squeeze and bite her.There is a shoot-out at the end or, maybe, a grenade-out would be better. It's not a very sophisticated movie and it doesn't demand much of the viewer. Lone gunman comes to love a little kid and sacrifices himself. And there are a couple of spots meant to be humorous that only sometimes hit the mark. Reno's imitation of John Wayne is superb.In fact, though, Reno is pretty good throughout. What an ""everyman"" kind of face. It's in no way glamorized. He's balding and his chin is stubbled. He dresses like a hobo and looks as if he might smell like a goat.Gary Oldman is a good heavy too, but the movie makes a clear distinction between bad killer Oldman and good killer Reno, who has a soft spot in his heart for beautiful children, rather like Allan Ladd had his kitten in ""This Gun For Hire.""

While she didn't care about most of her family she loved her younger brother and asks Leon to help her get revenge on those responsible for his death.Natalie Portman puts in a fine performance as Matilda in what is one of her best roles to date and Jean Reno is good as the quiet killer Leon, however the film is stolen by Gary Oldman playing Stansfield, the corrupt DEA officer in brilliantly over the top fashion.The story is fairly exciting throughout, especially during a siege where Leon and Matilda are surrounded by a large number of heavily armed police. The only week scene in my mind was when Leon was teaching her how to shoot a sniper's rifle and when she fires we learn she wasn't using live ammunition but some sort of paint-ball, it just seemed a bit of a cop out.. perhaps it was thought having a young girl killing a random person would have led to problems with the censors.",Léon - The Professional
13,BA_Harrison,The hit-man and her.,7,24 April 2017,"An unlikely relationship forms between 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who seeks revenge on the gangsters who slaughtered her family, and an assassin, Léon (Jean Reno), who lives in the same apartment building and teaches her how to 'clean'.A love story between a grown man and a twelve year old girl: sounds a bit dodgy, doesn't it? Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkwardSporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with Léon rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is Léon's lover.Thankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from Léon. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb.",Léon - The Professional

Begins as a rich character study studded with small bursts of violent action, with very little theatrics or inane hyperbole. Unfortunately, in the third act, Besson allows the violence to take over, leading to an over-baked finale with an eye on the commercial market.

16,Quinoa1984,"A thrilling crime film, in deep touch and care with the characters- Besson and Portman's best work to date",9,20 March 2005,"I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).So, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship, that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clichés, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional, is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over.",Léon - The Professional
17,sunwarrior13,Great Breakout By Natalie Portman,10,27 February 2012,"Léon: The Professional is a French thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Jean Reno as the titular mob hit-man, Gary Oldman as corrupt DEA agent Stansfield, a young Natalie Portman, in her feature film debut, as Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is taken in by the hit-man after her family is murdered, and Danny Aiello as Tony, the mobster who gives the hit-man his assignments.As visually stylish as it is graphically violent, this thriller directed by Luc Besson concerns Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl living in New York City who has been exposed to the sordid side of life from an early age: her family lives in a slum and her abusive father works for drug dealers, cutting and storing dope. Mathilda doesn't much care for her parents, but she has a close bond with her four-year-old brother. One day, she returns from running an errand to discover that most of her family, including her brother, have been killed in a raid by corrupt DEA agents, led by the psychotic Stansfield. Mathilda takes refuge in the apartment of her secretive neighbor, Leon, who takes her in with a certain reluctance. She discovers that Leon is a professional assassin, working for Tony, a mob kingpin based in Little Italy. Wanting to avenge the death of her brother, Mathilda makes a deal with Leon to become his protégée in exchange for work as a domestic servant, hoping to learn the hit-man's trade and take out the men who took her brother's life. However, an affection develops between Leon and Mathilda that changes his outlook on his life and career. Besson's first American film boasted a strong performance from Jean Reno, a striking debut by Natalie Portman, and a love-it-or-hate-it, over-the-top turn by Gary Oldman. Aside from that,pivoting on the unusual relationship between seasoned hit-man and his 12-year-old apprentice -- a breakout turn by young Natalie Portman -- Luc Besson's Léon is a stylish and oddly affecting thriller.It was one pretty awesome action movie.",Léon - The Professional

19,LeonLouisRicci,UnHollywood and Uneasy,9,20 May 2013,"There are two distinctly different versions of this Film. The theatrical American release called The Professional and the International and Home Video cut titled Leon: The Professional or just Leon. The longer by almost a half hour contains footage edited initially because other than Euro Audiences found the almost sexual but ultimately Platonic relationship between a 12 year old Girl and a 30 something Hit Man just too uncomfortable.It is the complete uncut version that is the more consummate and rich. It is realistic to assume the behavior of either Character and Director Luc Besson manages to approach the line of good taste but never crosses.This is a different kind of Crime/Action Movie to be sure. It definitely has a Non-Hollywood tone and has a gritty feel of the street. This isn't slick, except maybe in the Action scenes that are violent and impressively Artistic, but it is more of a heady affair of some very off the wall Characters. It delivers on many levels and is complex and exciting.This is a powerful Film with some powerhouse Performances. Requires involvement and a bit of tough analysis from the Viewer. It is an uncompromising and unconventional uncovering of some uncomfortable realities that are challenging as well as engaging. It is a Movie that can isolate many but also endear those willing to take on a bit more than usual.",Léon - The Professional

Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are beyond outstanding in the two leads and even Gary Oldman, a graduate of the Robert de Niro Academy where pupils are taught that SHOUTING equals Acting especially when VIOLENCE is added to the mix, can't really spoil what it is effect a bildungsroman. Somehow Luc Besson, far from a favourite of mine, has got it right against all the odds giving us yet Another movie in which a bachelor set in his ways is lumbered with a young child, almost always a girl, and emerges wiser even if, as in this case, stiffer as well.

A wired cop (Gary Oldman) thrust Mathilda into his arms, and he became her protector and trainer. This relationship unfolded slowly and beautifully and was truly a joy to watch.Sure, there was action, but it framed the story, which was really about Leon and Mathilda.

One day, a drug kingpin, Stansfield (Gary Oldman), kills her entire family due to something her father did. Mathilda turns to Leon for help...and revenge.Excellent crime drama. Good plot, meticulously set out and executed. Good action scenes too. Not just an action-drama though - there is also an emotional aspect to the movie, and a theme of setting down roots and belonging somewhere.Solid work by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman (12 years old and in her first movie) in the lead roles. Both these performances are eclipsed, however, by an amazing performance by Gary Oldman as the villain. Pure over-the-top, menacing, evil, bizarre genius of a performance by him.

Both their lives change dramatically, as they have to be with a person whom they know little about, but they like each other. The plot is captivating, and very well-written. The acting is all top-notch, especially from the three main characters, played by Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman. Each of them portray their respective character to perfection. The pacing is good, there is rarely a moment in the film where you are bored. The action scenes are very well done, action-filled yet relatively realistic. Every time there is an action sequence involving Leon, the hitman, you only see him briefly, every time he kills someone. It's like being a silent spectator, seeing a professional hitman in action. Very cool. I think most people who enjoys dramas, especially dramas about love and change, will like this, though some action fans might wanna give it a shot too(no pun intended). I also recommend this to any fan of the aforementioned actors, as all of them perform very well in this movie. 10/10",Léon - The Professional
25,view_and_review,Leon: the blue collar hit-man,9,14 March 2007,"""The Professional"" was probably the first hit-man film I ever watched. I'm not sure how many, if any, hit-man films came out before ""The Professional"", but being that I haven't heard of any, they could not have been as good. Since ""The Professional"", other hit-man movies have been released, such as ""Assassins"", ""The Specialist"", ""Last Kiss Goodnight"", ""Bourne Identity"", ""Mr. & Mrs. Smith"", and ""Collateral"". In these movies, and other similar movies, the hit-man (or hit-woman) was nicely dressed, clean cut, well spoken, and had seemingly unlimited resources. In contrast, Leon lived in an old apartment, he dressed shabbily, and had a heavy accent that he could not hide. Your affinity for Leon wasn't because he had and was everything you wanted, but because he was a regular guy just like you and me. You got a good feeling of the type of person Leon was even with the few words he spoke.You got an even better insight of Leon when he developed a relationship with Mathilda, who was played by a young yet bold and somewhat enticing Natalie Portman. The movie centered a lot around their relationship. Leon took in Mathilda after her family was killed by some crooked cops. She actually wanted Leon to teach her how to kill so that she could exact revenge. Mathilda was a multi-layered character as well, even though she was a child. As the bond between Leon and Mathilda developed and grew, and the movie funneled towards its apparent end, all that happened before with Leon and Mathilda steered Leon towards his ultimate act of self sacrifice.Leon's end game move did not diminish the movie one bit, on the contrary, it immortalized the movie. Everyone loves a hero, and more often than not the hero lives in the end after having saved the day, leaving everyone jubilant and happy. Very seldom is the hero killed, or more precisely, takes his own life just for the one he loves. Leon and Mathilda may not have been romantically involved, but they definitely forged a strong bond. Leon had some amazing moves in store for the team of police that came after him, but you can't help but feel that he could not and would not have been so determined if it weren't for his love for Mathilda",Léon - The Professional
26,morrison-dylan-fan,The professional cleaner.,9,21 October 2019,"Deciding to do a ""Auteurs in '94"" themed viewing week,I started looking for titles from well known film makers from the year. Despite having seen a number of his works,I've somehow always missed catching Luc Besson's most famous creation, which led to me at last meeting Leon.View on the film:Crossing the pond for the first time (to film exterior scenes)and the first of his titles to be in English, writer/directing auteur Luc Besson & his Thierry Arbogast thankfully keep their crisp Cinéma du look stylisation intact, targeting the flats Leon and Mathilda live under being painted in over-saturated yellow (also the same colour as Stansfield's suit.) Locking on Leon teaching Mathilda his skills, Besson continues to build upon his glossy, low-angle take-downs,brilliantly tracking the duo round corridors taking out targets, which stain the yellow walls with bursts of red dots.
His first fictional film since Nikita, (1990-also reviewed) the screenplay by Besson takes the espionage assassin training of Nikita, and twists it into examining the relationship Leon has with Mathilda, after Leon finds his training to stay completely detached from others, (a recurring theme for Besson) to start snapping at the edges from his need to care about Mathilda's survival. Joining Leon after her family are killed, Mathilda continues Besson's major theme of strong female characters, with the loss of her innocence by being around so much death, leading to a confrontational maturity.Reuniting with Besson from Nikita,Jean Reno gives a gripping performance as ""the cleaner"" Leon, with Reno mixing a cool dead-pan Noir loner swagger to successfully performing another assassination, with a restrained gravitas to the concern of keeping Mathilda alive. The first time he worked with Besson, Gary Oldman gives a thrillingly maniacal turn as baddie Stansfield, whilst Natalie Portman makes a incredible debut as the mentally mature with a punk edge Mathilda, who learns Leon's profession.",Léon - The Professional

Her father is abusive and her stepmother and siblings are even lower degrees of role models. Unfortunately her father is put in charge of stashing drugs for a corrupt DEA, played by Gary Oldman. When drugs go missing, the place is littered with bullets by corrupt police and Matilda manages to escape into Leon's apartment. She wants him to teach her how to be a killer so that she can avenge her younger brother who died in the shootout. He is reluctant but still feels obligated to protect her. Luc Besson manages a thrilling and explosive action film that weaves in some humour as the age different companions attempt to live together. Reno is great as the effective hit-man undergoing a change in responsibility. Oldman steals moments that the crazed DEA on the hunt. Natalie Portman steals the entire film in a daring and charming performance as a young girl wise beyond her years. Danny Aiello plays Reno's cash holder and contractor.

Soon, she finds out hid profession and seeks his help in taking revenge for her little brother......No matter how many times you see this film, one cannot deny the power of it's themes.Yes, we can all balk at the fact that Mathilda has a 'thing' for the titular character, but it's a lot deeper than that. Here is a girl who has had no real affection or love, from her family. Yes, we can argue that she has her brother to begin with, but she has had no one to look up to, no one to give her approval, and most of all, no one to respect.This is why her feelings are mixed with Leon. She is a confused little girl, in a big world, pretty much reflecting Leon, who is a lost soul too. He also has no one to show affection to, or receive affection from, apart from the movies he sees, hence the dressing up scene being one of the most touching scenes in the whole film.Oldman steals the movie from everyone though, and it's probably his most unhinged performance to date, spitting out every piece of scenery he chews on.So all in all, it's an undeniable masterpiece, Besson's most perfect movie, and to think, this was a side project whilst he was developing The Fifth Element.",Léon - The Professional
29,Aaron1375,Cops are the bad guys here.,8,15 February 2011,"This film was a rather good film that features a professional hit-man. You see this man do his job with deadly precision at the start of the flick then you learn a bit about his life. He is a simple man, who needs little. Well in the apartment complex he lives in is a family and the father of said family has run afoul of a dirty cop, played by Gary Oldman. Well this family is pretty much wiped out from the father to the wife and the young son, only the daughter survives and this is only because Leon, the hit-man, lets her into his home. This professional hit-man is played by the always interesting Jean Reno who I believed played the character in the foreign and original version of this movie (I think it was a French film). You have some humorous scenes of Leon teaching the orphaned girl how to clean (his term for knocking someone off). He tells her how one goes from long range to short range that you are truly great when you become adept at the close range. Though with all this you know that sooner or later the men who killed the girl's family are going to get back into play and you end up with a very explosive finale. The movie runs quickly and is entertaining. The acting is good and adds to the film, I did not really like the ending, but I kind of knew it was heading that way. Enjoyable film that really has good action and a pretty good story too.",Léon - The Professional
30,Mr-Fusion,"I guess I expected a cheap actioner, but this offered much more",8,11 March 2016,"It's funny, I remember seeing the laserdisc for ""Léon"" at a store back in the '90s. The cover featured a blurb that read (I'm paraphrasing from memory), ""It'll make 'Speed' feel like a slow ride to Grandma's house"", which always left with me with a particular thrill-ride impression. The truth couldn't be any further from that description, but there's something deeper here than just action junk food and that's why the movie comes on like a sucker punch.Everyone in this cast is extremely well chosen, but Oldman threatens to steal the show with his signature psychopathy. Geez, that guy. And on the subject of action, this has it, no question. When Reno dons his beanie, you know you're in for some bloody fun. But the movie's real asset is the pairing of hit-man and orphan (Reno and Portman, respectively). It's an unlikely relationship, but also earnest enough to really go for the heart at just the right point.It may look and feel like a Luc Besson action movie, but it's very well made and thoughtful in its sadistic approach. There's emotional resonance here, to be sure.8/10",Léon - The Professional
31,SimonJack,"Light dialog, far out plot, and wild mayhem don't make a good movie",5,23 August 2018,"""Leon: The Professional"" is a French-made film with a story that takes place in New York City. The simple plot for this film is a good one. It's a variation on any number of stories in which a woman or man take in a child who has lost her or his parents. This one has some unusual variations that set it apart from the others. Mostly, they make it a far out film and unbelievable film. The acting is good by most of the cast, but nothing exceptional. There is minimal dialog, especially between the two main characters, Leon and Mathilda. Jean Reno plays Leon, and Natalie Portman is Mathilda. Leon is a sociopath who makes a living killing people. He doesn't have a thread of conscience. He is antisocial throughout. Mathilda is 12 years old. She was abused by her parents and their various live-in friends. Her family was 
highly dysfunctional. Indeed, it doesn't resemble a traditional family at all. The only person she felt close to was her four-year-old brother. After drug dealers kill her family, Mathilda has a sense of hurt and loss for her brother. That festers into a desire for revenge. Leon was taken in as a teenager when he came to America as a refugee after his parents were killed in Italy. Tony is a mafia boss who took Leon under his wing and started him on the road to killing as a professional hit man. Leon is illiterate, and Tony arranges special hits for him and keeps his money. The story takes place in New York City, around the neighborhood of Little Italy. Leon and Mathilda lived in the same building. He takes her in reluctantly after her family is killed. When she discovers that he is a professional killer, she prods him to teach her tricks of the trade. One other far out aspect of the plot is that the head drug dealer is also a major leader of the federal Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). It appears that his whole staff are in on the deal and nothing but a bunch of wanton killers. Add to that what seems to be a completely corrupt New York police force, and this is a wildly unbelievable scenario. The director and writer expects the audience to believe that the entire law enforcement body in the New York area was crooked, and unconscionable drug handlers and killers. And that no one else in law enforcement would be wise to that fact. The way these guys move around, wildly wield their weapons, and push people around makes it seem like mob mayhem. This film flies in the face of more realistic films about the underworld of drugs. The one performance that stands out is Gary Oldman as Stansfield, the DEA boss. Yet, his character is so unbelievably narcissistic, that it's inconceivable that he wouldn't be noticed by others. This film closely resembles the mayhem madness of sci-fi or fantasy films set in the future when society is mostly lawless. For the portrayal of Leon's clever techniques and the small affection and friendship that blossoms between Leon and Mathilda, this film scores five stars. With a better and more realistic scripting of the DEA and law raids, and a better screenplay overall, it might have reached a level worthy of seven stars. There is nothing artistic about this film. It has no outstanding performances. The screenplay isn't that good. It seems to be little more than a tribute to violence and promoter of revenge - hardly noteworthy attributes of the silver screen.",Léon - The Professional

34,KineticSeoul,My favorite hit-man in one of my all time favorite films,10,16 January 2017,"I remember watching this film as a kid and being blown away by how awesome it is. From the action, the characters and the chemistry between Leon and Mathilda it was just all so darn memorable and cool. Sure, the relationship between an adult hit-man and a 12 year old girl may sound like it's messed up. But Luc Besson makes the whole thing work by making the hit-man Leon to be so darn likable, professional and yet naive. This is the role that Jean Reno will be known for throughout his acting career. He plays this secluded, introverted and yet sensitive hit-man who is very likable for a hit-man. Maybe because of his naive personality and how he doesn't live a rich and fulfilled lifestyle because of what he does. Maybe it's because Leon is a character that has certain codes and rules that he abides by. And for a hit-man he has some integrity and compassion. Some of it comes from Jean Reno's personal idea to make his character a bit mentally slow when it comes to things that didn't involve killing. This movie was a big hit in Asian countries, especially in japan. And a some Japanese movies, anime and manga tried to emulate some elements from this film. The ideas about the character Leon and his relationship with Mathilda came about because of Luc Besson's personal relationship with a teenage girl who is much younger than he is. Even Gary Oldman puts on a very memorable performance as a corrupt cop. His performance might be a bit over the top, but it stuck with me and it works when it comes to the context of this film. This is Oldman's performance I mostly remember him for despite him being a great actor. It's close the the performance level of Denzel Washington from ""Training Day"". This is even the performance that made Natalie Portman who played Mathilda into a star. Again it's the performance I remember this actress the most for. She brings about a lot of raw emotions for a very young actress. The first door scene where she is trying to get inside Leon's apartment by saying ""please"" made me feel for her character. In another words, overall this is the film that I remember all three actors for the most. Mix that in with one of the best script that Luc Besson has written so far and you got one of the best movies from the 90's. What made this film very lasting, impactful and memorable for me wasn't just because of the cool style of it all. And because of the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. But because it has one of the best ending I have ever seen in film. It's explosive figurative and literally when it comes to Leon's final mission. Overall, this is a brilliant film with marvelous acting, characters and direction. This is part action movie, part revenge movie and part controversial romance movie that doesn't take it too far. While having a bit of artistic ambiance to it without it being pretentious. I personally think of this film as a masterpiece.10/10",Léon - The Professional
35,Red-Barracuda,"Very good in some ways, problematic in others",6,20 April 2018,"When her family are slaughtered by a corrupt DEA officer and his men, a 12 year old girl takes refuge in a neighbour's apartment. A neighbour who it turns out is a professional hitman. She soon convinces him to train her to be his protégée.This was French director Luc Besson's first American movie. It is a follow up of sorts to his earlier chic action-thriller Nikita (1990), with Jean Reno essentially reprising his role of a cleaner (professional assassin), although in this one he is playing a different character. Like all Besson's movies there is considerable style brought to the table with the action sequences once again particularly well-delivered. But perhaps the true revelation of the movie is Natalie Portman who puts in an extremely strong performance for such a young actress, full of charisma, humour and emotional depth. She plays off well against Reno, who is also impressive. Gary Oldman, on the other hand, is pretty grating and annoying mostly as the main villain, a character who is cartoonish and somewhat ridiculous overall.While I do find this film good quality for the most part, with great action sequences and some interesting characterisations, I have to express serious reservations about the director's cut, where Portman's young character is constantly trying to get Reno to sleep with her. Its majorly uncomfortable stuff and really entirely unnecessary. And while Léon does spurn her advances, it's never really very clear that he rejects her for entirely the right reasons. Seemingly in the original script, the characters do actually end up sleeping together, which we can only be grateful never actually made the final cut but it does make you wonder what Besson was thinking with all this questionable stuff. My advice would be to avoid the director's cut and watch this one in the trimmed version, which removes all this contentious material.",Léon - The Professional

38,Robert_duder,"A rather obscure, dark, gritty pseudo-comedy that is altogether disturbing and watchable",7,15 April 2008,"It has been literally years since I wanted to see The Professional and finally after waiting and waiting I picked it up for really cheap and gave it a watch. I didn't really know what to expect and I still don't really know how I feel about the whole thing. In a way I have to give it to the film makers because they took an age old dramatic twist and added complete obscurity to it. It's the Punky Brewster, A Simple Twist of Fate (Steve Martin), Raising Helen (Kate Hudson) I could go on and on and on. A little person (usually a precocious little girl) inadvertently enters a single man's life and changes him and that is precisely what The Professional is only add in brutal gritty violence, sexualize the little girl to an almost disturbing nature, and just make it this really loud and violent story about two very different people who find each other. None of this makes the film inherently bad, just very adult, and gives it a very ominous and disturbing nature. I think this is exactly what has made The Professional the cult classic that it is because it takes a very big stretch in a genre and makes it somehow almost comical and yet dark and gritty and really twisted. Most people label The Professional as an action film and it certainly has that but I think I would say dark drama with thriller aspects.I have always liked Jean Reno. He really is a versatile character actor although he has never really broken into main stream. He certainly doesn't long for work as he has almost 80 film credits to his name and has done action, comedy, drama, foreign and domestic pictures and even was featured in a video game. As The Professional Reno is perfect. He has this dead pan face that just fits the role perfectly. He looks like a loner and he is still believable as a ruthless killer with a history of his own. He commands a presence on screen and yet it isn't quite leading man quality. Ultimately the young and very precocious Natalie Portman truly steals the show as trash talking, street wise Mathilda. She really does make the film and she should have been heralded with acclaim for this performance although a girl of her age shouldn't be in a performance like this. It's probably up for debate but I think they do sexualize Mathilda and Reno's character looks at her as a daughter figure but also a wife figure in some ways as she does him vice versa. Gary Oldman is over the top and deliciously twisted and deranged as corrupt cop and bad guy Stansfield. He is a terrific villain and a worthy adversary to Reno's Leon. Even though Oldman goes completely bonkers with this performance, somehow it works for the film. He is stunning. Veteran actor Danny Aiello has a rather small and not very effective part as the mobster Kingpin who gives Leon his jobs and carries his money for him.Now the only other experience I've had with director and writer Luc Besson is The Transporter and The Fifth Element and I think Besson is a brilliant director. I think he definitely thinks outside of the box when it comes to tried and true genres like action. I mean The Fifth Element was sci-fi action and yet it has this strange obscurity to it that makes it a cult classic and The Transporter definitely has a certain style to it and The Professional is no exception. Besson goes for his own certain flare and he wrote and directed this film with exactly that in mind. I don't know who I would recommend The Professional to...action fans might find it a little slower than most and drama fans might find it a little way out there but if you're looking for something a little different with some decent to really good performances than The Professional is worth seeing or if you like Luc Besson because this one has his stamp all over it. 7.5/10",Léon - The Professional

And on that level, ""La Femme Nikita"" was his most American-looking film, using archetypes that were even fresh for American audience, interestingly, one of them, from the 1990 hit ""Nikita"", would directly inspire his most critically acclaimed movies.Jean Reno played Victor, the cleaner, a hit-man whose specialty was to kill and get rid of bodies through acid. There was something absolutely fascinating in that scene-stealing character, cutting into the grittiness with a cool naturalness that made us wish he could last longer. I guess Besson felt there was a potential for such a character, A hit-man who shoots, hides behind doors, ducks and throws grenades, who can take two, three men and all of this, fitted Besson's predilection for fast-paced action, plural shots and overuse of traveling and zooming and so on. And what a challenge in terms of characterization!Somehow I like the English title even more than plain ""Leon"" (though ""Le Professional"" was already a classic starring Belmondo). It truly defines Leon, a pro. But he's also a man a bit slow, who drinks milk, takes care of a plant, and loves Gene Kelly. These attributions might feel phony or gratuitous, but they have a point. Reno deliberately made Leon simple-minded and innocent in order to decrease the tension during the intimate scenes between him and Mathilda. He knew if the professional was as vicious in real life as in his job, it would have ruined the movie. So, he played it as someone who'd be in the mindset of a young boy..And on the other side, you have Mathilda, a 12-year old pre-teen, who's seen more than the average kids, she's totally disillusioned, wasted and abandoned in a dysfunctional whose only valuable member is her little brother. Mathilda smokes, sighs, meditates a lot, she exudes the crappiness of life in her words and eyes that betray an inconsolable sadness. When she first meets Leon, she asks him if life is the same for adults, Leon has no encouraging answer. Mathilda is at the messiest time of her life, and somewhere, fate with the hand of a corrupt officer, named Stansfield and played by Gary Oldman, puts Mathilda under the protection of Leon, becoming the closest thing to a friend.And before Mathilda, the only friend Leon had (besides the plant) was a ""mission-giver"" played by Danny Aiello, became a sort of father-model for Leon ever since he came to the USA (hence 'ze' accent). It was time for Leon to turn into a fatherly figure himself. And ""The Professional"" becomes a wonderful coming-of-age story for both Leon and Mathilda, but to think that it's made with violence and sniper lessons as a backdrop makes the whole experience all the more excitingly disturbing. Contrasts make movies, and ""Leon the Professional"" shines with its contrasts.Mathilda is incredibly responsive to Leon's lessons and shows the same interest and curiosity a child would under these circumstances. Leon's action can seem irresponsible, but he's not even capable to answer for himself, he sees himself as the only possible person to provide Mathilda what she needs the most: order and a constructive routine, a reason to be, something to enjoy and affection I guess this is where the trouble starts. Mathilda admits she feels something weird in her guts, she sees Leon as a sort of Oedipal father, there's a weird mix of fascination and attraction. Leon is not interested, as he doesn't even have sexuality in the first place. The plant and the milk gives him an odd purity that prevented the film to shock viewers. Simple, but powerful symbolism!There's something in Natalie Portman that reminds of another child performance from the same year, Kirsten Dunst in ""Interview of the Vampire"", both are girls who've grown up fast, and have the look of adults. And when Mathilda sort of gives 'herself' as if she was ready to lose an innocence, it's the cruel admission that she had already lost it, I can understand why this line was cut, but I disapprove, because it all depends on Leon's reaction, and nothing he says hints an interest. The material is rather touchy but it's the reverse side of what made the story works, the man teaching a girl how to be a sniper and the girl playing a ""guess"" game with him. When Mathilda plays ""Like a Virgin"", it never feels controversial, she's like a teen playing and Leon looks even more childish.It's only when she confronts Stansfield again that she realizes it's not a game, and that indeed some people can be really creepy. ""Do you love life?"" he asks. She nods, ""Good because I have no pleasure taking it out from someone who doesn't care"". Why is the cop so creepily violent? We never know, there are things that are better left unexplained, it's part of this weird emotional experience, where a hit-man is like a guardian angel, and a civil guardian angel a devil, and in this urban chaos, a little girl is lost. Besson might have been perceived as the American French director, he injected European cinema in an American movie and this is why it fascinates so much.It is a love story of some sort, but about a true and tender father-daughter love, it's also a coming of age, an action film, a neo-noir, all of this carried by a wonderful acting trio. And if you look at it without thinking too much of the whole killing and shooting, the film might strike a very sensitive chord, and, it's one of the best of 1994, which is saying a lot.",Léon - The Professional
40,paul2001sw-1,"Has merits, but made me feel uneasy",6,24 February 2010,"With it's soundtrack of Bjork and Sting, Luc Besson's film 'Leon' certainly reminds one of the early 1990s. The film also showcases Besson's ability to create a visually coherent and interesting world, in this case a slightly earlier, grottier New York brought to life on camera. But the plot and characters are frankly silly and quite dull, unless one happens to find firearms inherently interesting. What keeps the film watchable is the winning performance from a young Nathalie Portman, who makes her own entry in the canon of precocious movie children. In fact, it feels like a bit of a guilty pleasure to enjoy her, because there's no doubt that the director is playing up her incipient sexuality; and while we may be supposed to laugh at the twelve-year old acting sixteen, I felt, in watching this movie, that the director was encouraging his audience to sexualise the character (or at least exploiting their expected reaction); there's definitely something not quite childish about it. I haven't seen her act better in anything she's made since.",Léon - The Professional
41,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A much more tender affair than you'd expect.,7,13 March 2018,"'Léon: The Professional (1994)' is a much more tender affair than you'd expect, one that's not so much driven by the eponymous assassin's life-meddling day-job but by his surprisingly human home-life and the relationships he forms during a time where both begin to catastrophically collide. The central dynamic is a little odd, though it's nothing compared to what was in the original screenplay, but ultimately turns out sweetly serene and incidentally innocent. The scenery-chewing villain is a little pantomime but menacingly hunts down the duo like dogs, which allows for some great action set-pieces punctuated by pure emotional moments. 7/10",Léon - The Professional
42,bowmanblue,Still holds up,8,5 July 2021,"The nineties had its fair share of great action movies, such as 'The Rock, Speed' and 'Armageddon' and, although 1994's 'Leon' doesn't really contain half as much action, or nearly a quarter of the destruction and special effects of the others, it's as if it sits in some sort of 'Marvel-style' 'shared universe' of movies.Luc Besson directs Jean Reno as the titular 'Leon' - a loner-hitman, living in New York, happily earning his money by *ahem* 'removing' people from circulation. His life is straightforward (if a little violent) enough, until a gang murders the family in the next apartment and he's forced to look after the only survivor - a young girl called Mathilda (Natalie Portman). The two of them form an unlikely bond and he even feels protective enough towards her to confide in her as to the true nature of his profession and maybe 'teach her the tools' of his trade.The premise is sound enough to warrant a watch, but 'Leon' is one of those rare films where every performance is just so perfect that it can't be flawed. Although, as great as its two leads are, it's Gary Oldman as the villain who steals every scene with his delightfully manic performance.Like I say, there's not half as much action or high-octane energy in 'Leon' when you compare it to other 'action' films. It's more centred on tension and the drama of each character and their slow transformations from interacting with each other.Perhaps the only small 'criticism' (notice the quote marks?) is that certain scenes do somehow feel a little 'uncomfortable' to watch. These normally focus around the young girl's 'feelings' towards her adult mentor, but then I'm guessing the script is supposed to show the awkwardness that a relationship like this can cause.However, that doesn't detract from the fact that 'Leon' is still as watchable today as it was back then and it's become a well-deserved classic in its own right since its release all those years ago.",Léon - The Professional

She's definitely the reason to watch it. The rest of the action film was slick and somewhat entertaining, but it felt like standard Hollywood fare, and didn't interest me nearly as much. Not a lot of it felt authentic and the dialogue was poorly written. I also think director Luc Besson sexualized Portman's character in places he didn't need to, giving the film a creepy feeling that's hard to get past.",Léon - The Professional
44,g-bodyl,Luc Besson: The Professional!,10,5 November 2013,"This film, Leon the Professional, is a very strong and powerful film. It's thought-provoking, but emotional. What I liked about this film the most is how we truly feel for the characters. The scenes that we got to know these characters are great since we learn what kind of people they are. I loved how they try to play out the relationship between Leon and his protégé, Mathilda.Luc Besson's film, which is his first American film, is about a hit-man named Leon who reluctantly takes in a girl whose family just got murdered by a corrupt DEA agent and his cronies. Wishing for revenge, Mathilda is tutored on how to kill in order for her to unleash her anger.The acting is very good. Jean Reno is very convincing as Leon and after watching this film, I believe this is his signature film. Making her film debut, Natalie Portman is great and really brings substance to her 12-year-old self. Finally, Gary Oldman is always amazing and he delivers one of his best performances. I love him as a villain and his Beethoven-loving character broadens him yet again.Overall, this is a great film that packs a punch and delivers the goods. One would expect this to be an action or gangster film, but it's more of a character study with more subtle moments. Not to say that there isn't any hardcore action, but the emotional punch this movie gives is what gives this film a heart. I rate this film 10/10.",Léon - The Professional

46,secondtake,Violent and touching at the same time--a beautiful stylized gem,9,5 June 2015,"Leon the Professional (1994)A tightly wrought, ironically charming (and no so ironically violet) caper about an accomplished assassin and a sweet girl. The assassin Leon is played with dry, raspy wit by Jean Reno. He's one of those guys who's ""the best"" without question, and who lives off the radar naturally. All he has is a suitcase and a potted plant in his small apartment. The girl, Mathilda, is played with a perfect combination of innocence and worldly savvy by Natalie Portman. When her family is wiped out by gangsters, she is taken in by the assassin, who happens to live next door.The bad guys are led by Gary Oldman, who is a caricature of an evil thug gangleader. And behind the scenes in the middle of all his is the inimitable Danny Aiello in a small but important role. All of this weirdly makes sense, and the plot moves along with our growing concern for Mathilda, above all. And then for Leon, by extension. So whether you call this a buddy movie or an over-the-top farce, it's so well connected, smoothly filmed, and forcefully acted it just feels and looks right. It's just superbly made.Director and writer Luc Besson is a marvel, really, and anyone who has seen ""La Femme Nikita"" or ""Fifth Element"" knows that he can show imagination and style with edgy contemporary punch. He's the main example of the so-called ""cinema du look"" style of French movies, a kind of counter-balance in self-aware movie-making to Quentin Tarantino's more artificial style. Besson is essentially a writer first and director second, and he wrote all of these as well as the ""Taken"" movies that have recently been so successful both in France and here.If some bloody violence doesn't put you off, add this to your must-see list.",Léon - The Professional
47,Irishchatter,A great film with lots of action!,9,29 November 2015,"Honestly I never heard of Jean Reno before and he bloody blew me away man! He just really does a great assassin, he is such a snake like! I have no words to describe him more but all I can say, he is a talented Moroccon actor out there! Natalie Portman looked so young for 11 years, I was surprised to see she did smoked in some scene. The scenes seeing her did seem light instead of hanky panky. I wouldn't have thought her character Matilda and the assassin Leon would actually make out in the movie. It would make it totally sensitive for some viewers. I personally, think it would give me a cringe and feel shocked that Hollywood would go that far. Anyways luckily it didn't happen!It was good to see Gary Oldman, he really does a bad guy so good! His role in this actually reminded me when he was in the 1992 version of Dracula. He really gave an outstanding success as a bad dude very much so. Very good actor!I'm definitely gonna put this as my favorite movie list because literally, my jaw was done to the ground the whole time watching this, and I extremely enjoyed it!I would recommend people who haven't seen this, just watch it!",Léon - The Professional

The plot is like a fairytale for adults, that would never happen in real life, and there aren't people who live like Leon, nor there are 12 years old girls who can come armed with two weapons into police headquarters with main goal to kill a detective. But this is a movie for god-sake, and a great one it is.It is very sentimental, but that is just one of the parts that makes it's unique and unforgettable. Character are drawn very sharp in here and we start to care for both lead from the opening sequence of them together - that is because of performances, great and simple script and wonderful chemistry between two leads - this is still i think one of the very best performances by Natalie Portman. Directing, cinematography are great, with some clearly visible style and mood trough the film, which makes it feel like a unique - still.Overall, ""Léon"" is great action film with lots of well made sentiments. Performances are amazing by all three actors (Oldman including), but it's Natalie who steals the show. Add craftsmanship which creates this unique style, simple but sharp script and tons of sentimental moments (but not to much) and a bit coming of age story and you will get a mix of superb motion picture, a true fairytale for adults.

As the orphan, Portman is wonderful in her film debut. As Leon, Reno does OK but his character is unbelievable and underdeveloped. It is hard to believe that Leon, an uneducated, dim-witted, child-like fellow who loves plants and drinks milk is also a cold-blooded killer. He tells Portman she shouldn't use foul language but teaches her how to kill people. What a guy! Oldman, who would play Beethoven in his next film, is horribly over-the-top as a Beethoven-loving psycho DEA agent. On the plus side, the score is nice and the celebrity impersonations by Portman and Reno are amusing.",Léon - The Professional
52,The-Sarkologist,One wild wide of an action movie,9,25 October 2013,"This is Luc Besson's first American movie, and has been listed by some as simply brilliant. The Professional is far better than a lot of movies, especially with the characters, but did not come out as I expected. Still, I really enjoyed this movie, and still stick to my opinion that Luc Besson is an awesome director, which is not surprising as he is French.This movie is about a cleaner, or hit-man, name Leon (Jean Ruso) who is very good at his job. He is an illiterate loner who only knows how to kill people. He rescues a 12 year old girl, Matilda (Natalie Portman), whose family is all killed by a corrupt DEA official named Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Matilda's father beat her and her sister and mother did not care about her, so she wasn't concerned about that, the thing that made her angry was that they killed her four year old brother, and for that act of brutality, she wants to see them dead.This movie delves into the mind of Leon. We see how he lives well by himself and how the appearance of this girl changes his life. In one scene we see Leon return from a kill with a bullet wound, and we know that this came from the fact that Matilda has changed his life. This relationship is interesting and Besson is portraying it as a father daughter relationship, yet the participants do not understand it. Leon is a man who is completely out of touch with society while Matilda is blinded by desire for vengeance and still childish beliefs. When she says that she is in love with Leon, it is obvious that she does not truly understand her feelings.The main premise behind this movie is how the introduction of this child into Leon's world changes his life and civilises him. Something that he fears at the start becomes something that he adores.",Léon - The Professional
53,slightlymad22,Perfect cast and a good story = perfect entertainment,10,15 August 2014,"Bloodshed and retribution are the main ingredients as Leon, a lonely hit-man saves the life of Mathilda, his 12 year old neighbour, after her family are killed by crooked DEA Agents. The protagonist is an Italian hit-man with nerves of steel, grace of a panther and the killing instinct of a great white shark, played with subtle grace by Jean Reno. The story is filled with the standard elements, but the movie is anything but a by the numbers 90's action flick.Jean Reno is perfectly cast as the title character Leon. As is Gary Oldman as a crooked DEA Agent Norman Stansfield. In her first acting role, a young Natalie Portman is superb as the troubled Mathilda, showing her early potential that would one day win her an Oscar for 'Black Swan' And finally Danny Aiello is as watchable as he always is. As the story proceeds, one by one Leon and Mathilda bond, as he cuts down the ranks of their numbers. Luc Besson's direction keeps the action moving at a steady pace and as the movie builds, traditional concepts of right as wrong are slowly destroyed. Besson is saying life is not so clean cut, and it leads to an inevitable climax in which Leon and Stansfield finally come face to face. Where Besson doesn't state his message, he makes his audience feel it.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Oldman gives the best performance of his career here, achieving an intensity and energy in to his role that truly gave me the creeps at times. He is always reliable, but here he is truly awesome. Not to be out done Jean Reno, who has contributed some tough fisted, hard as nails characters over the years, also provides a career high as the gentle hit-man. Although tough and crafty when he is working, he is almost child like, he is sensitive, he can be embarrassed and feels fear. Reno's likability excuses the unpleasant violence his character uses.This was a stunning first performance for Portman and she deservedly got loads of praise and attention for it. It was a great platform for her career (The year after this, she would again be superb as Al Pacino's troubled, suicidal step daughter in 'Heat'.) Whilst she was just a child when this was made, today she remains one of the most talented and beautiful women in movies, and her ladylike sexiness is in rare supply. Any movie becomes promising just by having her name in it's cast.With perfect casting and a good story, this was always going to be a winner. Luc Besson's directing of his own story is exceptionally good, his work has energy, wit, visual flair and the breath of life in it, that has been missing in most of his work between then and now. Eric Sena's score is another valuable asset to the movie.

55,sol-,Professionalism,9,18 April 2016,"Also known as 'The Professional', this Luc Besson thriller follows the bond that grows between a loner hit-man and a preteen girl who he gives shelter to after her family is massacred. The film features several well crafted action sequences, a memorable escape from a seemingly inescapable situation and an excellent pulsating music score. The best asset here though is the unusual bond between the pair, which Besson carefully works through; as an impressionable near-teenager, the girl goes from viewing Léon as a saviour, to a father figure, to a mentor, to a potential lover, to simply a caring friend, and a young Natalie Portman hits every note perfectly in her portrayal (consider the respect she shoes Léon when he asks her not to smoke compared to her real father). Jean Reno is also fine as the hit-man, resisting temptation to lead her on when in her 'lover' phase. Not everything about Reno/Léon quite rings true. His constant drinking of milk (in lieu of liquor) and his affection for potted plants are obvious devices to soften the character, however, his life philosophy feels real at every turn, having to make some very hard choices; he even considers putting a bullet through Portman's head in her sleep to end her misery. The film's best performance though arguably comes from Gary Oldman, more maniacal than ever, talking gibberish about classical music and setting everyone around him on edge. The surrogate father/daughter angle is, however, what really propels the film. It highlights the ability of two lonely souls to connect in the crazy, violent world out there. Thoughtful stuff.",Léon - The Professional

Another interpretation that has to be mentioned was Gary Oldman's who played as Stansfield and he was equally good.

58,johnnyboyz,"Still one of the more quotable, entertaining, touching and flat out enjoyable films I've ever seen.",10,5 December 2008,"Léon is pure film-making, outstanding just as it is hypnotic just as it is out and out entertaining. Known as The Professional to others, Luc Besson's debut English language film captures the essence of evil on screen just as it does the potential hope other individuals may carry amidst all the gloom and depression in one of cinema's favourite down and out cities: New York. Why Léon is such an unrecognised film is quite bewildering  IMDb has it grossing a modest $19 Million dollars but it won two awards and garnered a few other nominations. Everyone likes a hero and most people like a story where two people (usually of opposite genders) connect in certain times of hardship amidst a locale of no hope  at its core, Léon could be seen as exactly this.The film is a tale of revenge, a love story and a crime drama complete with hit men, criminals, bent police men and innocent young girls caught up in the middle. The film presents to us how one event or one act of greed can act as a catalyst for bigger and nastier things, on a much larger scale than first intended and the film also brings a certain humane quality to worn out clichés and typical characters for the genre; like Tarantino and the Coen brothers at the height of their quality as seen in Pulp Fiction and Fargo respectively, this is Luc Besson stripping down the screen and delivering on a simplistic but immensely satisfying level.The ingredients work in Léon. At its heart, a vulnerable hero in Mathilda (Portman) who is established to be living in a 'world' that is less than perfect but is a hero whose life is changed by an outside, unseen event and must then realise this as a trigger for not only her desire for revenge, but the propulsion into the real world in which she will learn the skills she needs and generally mature. The idea, or formula, is best presented in the training montage Léon (Reno) himself and Mathilda partake in to a popular Björk song  it is the classic case of passing time to a montage to signify maturity and learning.But this is in no way a criticism as much as it is recognising and appreciating effectiveness. Mathilda's goal is to avenge the death of not her family as such, but her little brother who she deemed was innocent at merely eight or so years old. By this rational, her mother and sister were also innocent but Mathilda just doesn't appreciate them as much to avenge their deaths. The film's principal study begins with its hero on the verge of suicide, as a scene over the phone with a correctional institute tells us: Mathilda mimics her mother and tells the woman on the phone that Mathilda's death is the reason she hasn't been attending school. It is the low point of Mathilda's life and occurs just prior to the point of no return in which corrupt DEA officers blow away the rest of the family. The point of no return is signified beautifully as Mathilda walks past the wreckage of her apartment, gazing in slow motion, and rings the bell on Léon's door  the door opens and light fills the screen as she is accepted.The film actually fills up a lot of its time prior to this with Léon himself, not necessarily tricking the audience as to who the film will be about, but informing us of the type of person that awaits Mathilda. Indeed, the opening scenes or indeed shots of the camera towering over Central Park and down a New York street presents to us the location of New York in all its grimy glory as we delve deep within the heart of the city, all the time the tracking shots getting closer to ground level and all the time getting nearer to its destination, a café run by a man named Tony (Aiello). The first we see of Léon are his round sunglasses, creating a physical barrier between us, the audience, and the identity of this man whom downs glasses of milk in no time and talks casually about killing people for money. But the following scenes of Léon happy, enjoying himself and getting on with ironing and watering plants breaks off from stereotypical hit-man personas and gives us a different light. This leads to Léon's first encounter with Mathilda during which he tells her life is ""always like this"", this twinned with the fact we know she's potentially suicidal makes the audience uneasy. But, she seems jolly and happy when she goes to the store for Léon  she is out and about and doing something for someone else that she deems worthy of such attention, which will echo the understanding and the relationship they'll soon have. Incidentally, later on Tony's warning about change being 'a bad thing' and that Léon was in trouble before over a woman paints a potentially ominous picture.The villain of the piece is Norman Stansfield (Oldman) who is a very intimate and aggressive character and Oldman plays him in a way that suggests someone who could go from green to red or from calm to sociopathic in a matter of seconds. The fact he tells one of his men to tell the police that ""we were doing our job"" hints that the sort of prior violent activity is not unfamiliar to Stansfield and co. further creating a dangerous opinion of the characters in our minds  they are not to be messed with. Léon is a tale of a young protagonist having to learn the hard way and still not really being up to scratch; it is a hybrid of crime, drama, romance and tragedy that spirals out of control but remains dramatic and heart wrenching all the same  Besson has made few English language films but there will always be Léon.",Léon - The Professional
59,filipemanuelneto,"An excellent movie, with a good story.",9,30 June 2018,"Before I saw this movie I had heard about him. However, I tried not to have too many expectations. I did well, I was surprised by the film.The plot is simple: Leon is a professional killer with European origins. It's good at what he does. However, his life changes when he saves the life of a girl, Mathilda, whose parents are his neighbors and are slaughtered by a drug dealer whom they had tried to deceive. From then on, they become a kind of distorted family: he protects and welcomes her, and she tries to be like him, determined to avenge the death of her four-year-old brother, the only person she loved.I loved the story told by this movie. Its full of feelings and humanity, in a universe that seems anything but human: the underworld of crime. The young Mathilda is a character full of contrasts: she appears to be very young but says she is grown up and she behaves like an adult: cursing, smoking, drinking - even though she is clearly not used to drinking - and even feeling attracted to her protector, who is a lonely man who wants to remain alone and does not feel for her any bond other than friendship and piety. A suffering man, clearly marked by life, who keeps a single strong connection with a plant, whom he cares lovingly. The characters are excellently played by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, far from the fame that would later enshrine her in films, such as ""Black Swan"" or ""V for Vendetta"". I confess that I found her performance incredible. Gary Oldman brought to life the main villain, the sadistic Stansfield, a man who has two faces and a secret life, but who does not know how to hide a deeply violent and cruel personality.This was Luc Besson's first film I saw, and I confess I was very impressed. The director seems to be thorough and made this film with great care and attention. Filming locations have been carefully selected and wisely used, cinematography is stylish and uses some original and creative camera angles. In the same way, light and color are used in a very appropriate way, and the film cannot be said to be dark or gloomy. The sets and costumes are good and there is some symbolism in the way they present themselves (for example, the empty house of Leon that, suddenly, Mathilda seems to fill with life). The soundtrack, something stylized, goes well with the theme of the movie and what we are watching on screen.In all respects, it's a highly commendable movie to watch several times.",Léon - The Professional
60,leplatypus,It's NOEL for Natalie (DVD),10,20 September 2010,"Funny but Natalie comes from natale, thus the birth of Christ, thus Christmas or Noel in french! Seriously, for her first feature, she got a wonderful gift and was able to give in return a tremendous acting! I don't know for others stars but at her age of 13, she shows that she can cry and laugh and express all the feelings between with an evident talent! That's the kind of interpretation that hooked me for life. Her Mathilda character is very valuable because i find ""beauty"" in compassion, fragility and funny spirit. Those give us great moments of movies: the ring at the gateway, the disguise game, ... It was great to see how she can lead Reno (who isn't a soft man), how he can lead her on the final battle and how she is dismissed by Aiello.I think the movie owes a lot to Reno as well and also to Besson. For the legend, it was him who found Natalie and gave her a chance, it was him who nurtured the cast with such grace (and that was him who directed the movie. If i like American movies in France, french movie in America are scarcer and indubitably, Besson has brought his French touch: i have never seen New York like this and his camera is alive, wide open, a mix between De Palma and Lynch! The opening credit is an homage to this ""Big Blue"" with the shock of civilization (we even saw the Twin Towers).I don't know if a ""Lolita"" vision is acute here but i think that anlecture that links unconsciously the flower as a feminine womb and the milk as a male semen add very powerful sense to the relationship! A unique masterpiece in conclusion all the worth that a sequel seems highly unlikely.",Léon - The Professional
61,TheMovieDiorama,Léon is someone you really don't want to mess with.,8,13 May 2018,"Safe to say this film has spawned many iterations of omnipotent invincible hitmen, it isn't hard to see why. Opening to a lukewarm reception, Léon has rapidly garnered cult status and is a firm favourite amongst film aficionados. A young girl's family is brutally gunned down by a crooked detective, she teams up with a hitman named Léon in order to avenge their deaths. Suffice to say this is an action drama that needs to be viewed by everyone...and I mean ""EVERYONEEEE!"". It would be easy to class this as an exaggerative over-the-top action thrill ride, but it's so much more than that. Thanks to Besson's Parisian directing style, he focussed his attention to the quirky original relationship between Léon and Mathilda. A girl who has experienced the dark side of life, growing up with a father who deals drugs and regularly hooking up with women. To then be embraced by a determined yet warming hitman, her idyllic fantasy of a caring father figure becomes reality. The bond that rapidly forms between these two characters is fascinating to watch. Her idolisation for him and his protectiveness for her. It's a union that shouldn't work, but does. They both teach each other aspects of life they aren't necessarily familiar with, which furthers the intricate character development. Acting was terrific from everyone. Reno's commanding titular performance encapsulated the screen. Portman's debut is quite possibly the best child performance I've seen. And then there's Oldman as the crazed antagonist, who steals every scene. Whilst this is absolutely entertaining, there are obvious issues. The plot is too thin to carry the full runtime, it takes far too much time developing the character relationship where the actual plot feels neglected, leaving the antagonist on the sideline until the third act. Also the music choice occasionally didn't fit the bustling urban environment and took me out of the film. Aside from those points, it's considerably better than most crime dramas and has aged impeccably well. Everyone needs a Léon in their life.",Léon - The Professional
62,Tweetienator,Léon Still Rules the Mob,8,19 September 2018,"I re-watched the movie yesterday and just can state - this movie does not age. A fine and well forged piece of a thriller with some unusual ideas and wonderful actors. The only sad fact - i can't remember one movie of the crime/drama genre with so much quality in the past years (well, maybe with the exception of Sicario and No Country For Old Men). Anyway, Léon belongs like Pulp Fiction, American History X and The Godfather to the absolute highlights of the crime/drama/thriller genre, and Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and the young Portman delivered some of their finest performances ever.If you never watched this one, maybe because of your age, watch.",Léon - The Professional

Even at this age you could see her natural beauty and ability as an actor.The acting was awesome and the plot was well laid out, but I found several parts of the movie which weren't believable. I won't bother with them here, but you can see from my score that these scenes brought the movie down a few notches for me.I definitely would recommend this movie in HD or even 3D with a mega, killer sound system. It was really meant to be played on the big screen and small screens with crappy sound systems really do it an injustice.Every once in a while I see this on normal television and I watch it for laughs because they do the ""pan and scan"" which completely ruins the movie beyond words. I personally thing ""pan and scan"" should be against the law.

Leon is amazingly n very differently portrayed by Reno.There is a Bollywood copy known as Bichoo (Scorpio).The only thing good in the Bollywood movie is that the guy who played Tony gives away all of the hitman's money to the girl whereas in the original, the character of Tony gives only a single currency note to Mathilda n keeps blabbing the same ""safer than the usual bank story"".",Léon - The Professional
66,insomniac_rod,"Moving, dramatic, powerful, and filled with Action.",8,1 September 2007,"A sui generis movie filled with action, tenderness, a American-Italian mafia, corruption, and a cold blooded hit-man who finds a new meaning about life after meeting a young girl.""León"" is more than just a hit-man movie; it's the perfect combination of action and drama. The plot is more than complex than you could think. First, we can see the movie through 2 points of view.The first, in my opinion, deals with Mathilda being literally rescued by León and then him taking care of her life (as a consequence of rescuing her; he couldn't leave her alone).The second deals with Mathilda wanting to be a ""cleaner"" or a hit-man (girl version). She's obsessed with taking revenge for her little brother's murder.Anyways she and León grow a special relationship based on tenderness and loneliness. Both have similarities between them as they are alone in the world and then they have not a secure future.The performances are top notch, Oscar worthy. Jean Reno delivers a spectacular performance although he does not speaks that much; but his corporal acting and facial expressions are excellent. He's one fine actor. Natalie Portman demonstrated why she's one of the most talented young actresses in the world. And the girl was only 11! Her performance is brave, sweet, and dramatic. A one of a kind performance.The Direction is excellent. A perfect Action movie with Dramatic tones that looks modern, classic, and stylish. Very good visual experience.I can't praise this movie enough and I can't think how many times I've seen it. León is a movie that deserves to be watched by everyone.The crucial part of the movie in my opinion is when León helps Mathilda escape from the attack Stansfield sends against them. León makes everything possible to save Mathilda and even risks his life and in a moving scene he tells her (my words are not that accurately) something like ""we're gonna make it, you gave a new meaning to my life; I want to sleep in a bed (he never slept fully), drink milk, etc. Sadly, only Mathilda escapes but now her future is secure as León's money will pass to her. Then she signs into a private school for girls; now her future looks shinny.León is the best hit-man in town but at the end he can't survive a massive attack against him. Still, a satisfactory and moving ending. Even the sexual tension between Mathilda and León is justified and totally comprehensive. I mean, Mathilda is about to explore her sexual needs and feelings and León is a lonely man who has little or non existent contact with women; not to mention Mathilda is extremely beautiful.Anyways, a movie that you can dig the whole time.",Léon - The Professional

68,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"""The Professional"" brings some food for thought to the assassin flick",9,2 January 2009,"Unlikely friendships are often the focus of great film and literature as far back as Huck Finn and Jim. Luc Besson's film ""The Professional"" gives unlikelihood a whole new meaning as its focus is on a professional hit-man and a troubled, 12-year-old girl. Naturally there's a lot these two can learn from each other and probably a lot they shouldn't, but it all makes for interesting and compelling material.Leon, played by Jean Reno, is a highly skilled, elusive hit-man who works for an Italian mob leader. He's also an immigrant with no means of being completely self-sufficient (he can't read or write and doesn't keep his own finances). He also lives in a run-down NYC apartment next to a family with an abusive, dope-dealing father. When the father gets into trouble, a psychotic and corrupt cop (Oldman) has his whole family taken out. Only Mathilda (Portman), the youngest daughter, survives. With nowhere to go when she's supposed to be dead, she turns to Leon.Leon and Mathilda form a unique bond. Both Reno and Portman are perfect in their roles. Leon is a creature of habit whose sensitive side comes out in caring for this young girl and Portman portrays both the beauty and innocence of a 12-year-old girl who at the same time is highly motivated by vengeance and a sense of inescapable maturity. You can certainly see why Portman was destined to be a successful actress. Mathilda's persistence to learn Leon's craft and his acceptance eventually is a bit disturbing and hard to grasp at first, but the more time they spend together, the more you love their relationship. You get a sense for how sweet Mathilda is and how good-hearted Leon, an assassin, can be. Besson also focuses on both actors' strongest trait: their eyes, which are highly communicative of these ideas.The complications that arise when Mathilda tries to seek her own vengeance against Oldman's character further complicates the nature of this unlikely friendship, exposing it for how dangerous it is, but also testing its merit--showing us how strong it can be. The action scenes that arise from this plot are also sure to satisfy those who want ""The Professional"" to deliver on that end, even if it's far from the focus. It's really about this friendship and to be honest, there could have been even more from the two of them: it was almost as if (and it may be the case) the American release was stripped in places by producers to emphasize the action pieces for fear the film couldn't thrive on the relationship element.Oldman is another piece that shouldn't go unmentioned. Though his character isn't given much depth to warrant high acclaim, Oldman is quite terrifying in his own way. It certainly offers explanation for his slew of villain roles in the 90s.Besson has really given all of us gun-toting-movie lovers something to chew on here, which is really the film's greatest achievement. While countless crime dramas, thrillers and action films glorify the gun, Besson shows it for how terrifying it is, even if he does have to use Hollywood elements at times to keep the film's pace up. ""The Professional"" really has it's own special place in the wide array of assassin films.",Léon - The Professional

70,imseeg,A gangster's fairytale,9,24 March 2018,"So much can be said about this movie. It is really a wild guess that worked out brilliantly to let a kid play a leading role in a gangster movie. Nathalie Portman's debut is to thank for the truly magnificent believability she gives to her role. Jean Reno, Danny Aiello are the other masters at work. Gary Oldman however plays the part of his life. Nothing is scarier than a lunatic who smiles at you. And he plays the part of the mentally deranged corrupt criminal so well that it is a joy to watch again and again.Seen ""Leon"" 10 times or more now and I keep loving it. Every time I think now I have seen it all, but it stays thrilling till the very end. And endearing. How does director Luc Besson do that? How does he make a serial killer so likeable? If I would just tell the story you wouldnt believe me. Objectively speaking this script makes no sense. None. Even a character in the movie who has to explain what has happened isnt believed. A hitman for the mob gets befriended with a young girl. That's the story in a nutshell. But that doesnt come close to what really happened. The story presented in a nutshell sounds sweet, doesnt it? But there are massive amounts of assasinations that take place in between scenes.How can that be sweet? But it can be, because the violence in ""Leon"" is presented as if it were a game of playing cowboys and indians. That ""funny"" tarantino kind of violence in ""Leon"" is produced by a frenchman who came to America: director Luc Besson. This man has an odd talent: he mixes humor and childlike innocence on the one hand with brutal violence on the other hand. And somehow it works. The violence is cartoonlike and funny, but still suspensefull and realistic. Just as in Quentin Tarantino's work. You can laugh about the violent crimes in ""Pulp Fiction"" but you still take Samuel L. Jackson seriously. Oh I could go on and on about this movie. Never felt a bigger urge to write about so many different aspects in a review as with ""Leon"". Because it is extraordinary unique in script and excecution by the director. I think that ""Leon"" is Luc Besson's masterpiece. Brilliantly directed. Brilliantly performed. And a script that is bonkers but still so believable and endearing thanks to those magnificent young acting talents that came together in this fabulous gangster's fairytale!",Léon - The Professional
71,videorama-759-859391,"One cool action piece, ala Besson, that shows true professionalism",8,23 April 2015,"The Professional is a super charged action piece, an exhilarating violent ride, riveting and terrifying, especially in it's first twenty minutes, with an explosive almost, hard to top ending, that truly blew me back against the wall of the cinema. It's a cinematic movie treat. If you can remember, a year and a half before, came The Assassin, too, a good movie, but this one has more intensity, but still qualifies for an 8. This is also Natalie Portman's first acting gig, and it's a role I'll never forget. When you watch her, you'll see why this was a star in the making, who blossomed with every role. Just check out, her next role in Heat. When Matilda/Portman's family is slaughtered by a force of corrupt cops, lead by DEA agent, Stansfield (Oldman in a perfected piece of villainy) she takes refuge, with a hit-man Leon (Reno) who lives down the hall. One truly intense moment has her pleading for him to open the door, the corrupt force in the close behind, realizing their missing one member of the slaughtered family, you are silently pleading too. The two form a friendship and an alliance, with Reno taking Matilda under his wing, teaching her, the avid protégé, the art of taking bad guys out, by use of sniper tactics, and other skills required to make the grade of a real hit-man. Leon is the closest thing, Matilda has come to a family for a long time, as if not counting the little brother, his murder sight wisely spared, the rest of her adopted family, weren't saints. The father was a boozing scumbag, the main objective at the hands of this dirty force. The mother (Ellen Page, of all people) is a cheap tart, and Matilda's older podgy sister, who works out, was a bitch. Oldman, too is unforgettable here, who just shows you how versatile he can be, one of the most underrated and unappreciated actors, like Nick Nolte, I've ever seen in my life. What I truly loved about The Professional was just the friendship that developed between Matilda and Leon, and how it played out. One scene having Matilda play dress up, and Reno trying to guess the acted out star and vice versa, I really loved. The build up of friendship and trust between impulsive kid and wise adult is mostly what Act 2 rides on. It's thin, but we can forgive this, because the friendship really involves us, and there really are some funny moments, created ny the two. We see a much more human side of a hit-man too, as Leon is not your ordinary hit-man. He's an ordinary average Joe, you'd pass on the street. He doesn't even act like a hit-man, the sort of guy who doesn't eat out, or live it up. But at first glance, as by example of his work, in it's opening, we really fear him, as a guy you do not mess with. He's a guy who'll find you, no matter where you hide. Danny Aiello who play's Reno's close friend, is only in a couple of scenes, one a weird dream sequence involving him and Oldman, where of course, you first think the scene is real. His short but memorable screen time is appreciated. The climax to The Professional reminded a lot of the one in The Specialist, but here it was beautiful. The Professional uses less scenes than it could of had, and that's a plus, as it's pulled off beautifully in ones 95's cool action pieces, with one tragic, thunderstruck ending.",Léon - The Professional
72,Vartiainen,Classic for a reason,8,21 April 2015,"Action movie filmed using art house film techniques. As much art as it is enjoyment. Each scene carefully crafted to place both the eye as well as the need for action. A tale about an orphaned girl, Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who happens to fall under the wing of a seasoned yet somewhat simple-minded assassin, Léon (Jean Reno). From there, an unexpected friendship blooms.What I like the most is the atmosphere. The world of this film is cruel. Officials are corrupt, you cannot trust your own parents, everyone is willing to look the other way and as a whole there's not much hope to be had. Yet the film's tone doesn't reflect that. Many of its scenes are lighthearted, perhaps a bit naive, but ultimately optimistic. In a lesser film this dichotomy would bother me, but here it works. Its part of the message, that there are pockets of goodness to be found, that not all bad men are evil, just like not all so called angels are good.The camera-work is also excellent, the pacing flawless and the characters are interesting. I must admit that I didn't find the story to be as captivating as I was led to believe, but I blame the hype, not the movie. The ending was also somewhat of a letdown, but it just means it wasn't my cup of tea, not that there was anything wrong with it.Léon is classic for a reason and rightfully considered to be Luc Besson's masterpiece.

Mathilda vows revenge and pressures Leon to teach her his deadly trade. Reno is great as the efficient but almost child-like killer, who drinks milk, cherishes his houseplant, learns to read, and ultimately ends up showing his young charge how to kill people, and Portman, who was only 12 when the film was made, is outstanding as a pubescent 'avenging angel wannabe'. On the other end of the gun barrel is Oldman's 'doped-up-psycho-cop' character, but the film has a bit of a fantasy feel to it so his sometimes screechingly over-the-top delivery works (IMO). Léon and Mathilda's off-beat, asymmetrically innocent relationship is developed beautifully and the story plays out to a great, if somewhat predictable, end. Apparently Besson's original screenplay was sort of a 'Lolita with guns', but Reno and Portman (or maybe her parents) nixed the idea of Léon becoming romantically entangled with 12 year old Mathilda and Reno was careful to play the part to minimise the chance that the audience would misinterpret the relationship. All in all, a memorable action film (with a great poster) from the '80s. Some of the stories about young Portman's introduction to the world of film make for interesting reading.

75,freemantle_uk,Luc Besson hits America,10,7 May 2008,"Leon is a great little action film, starring Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman. It was Luc Besson's first American film and made Jean Reno into a star in America and started off Natalie Portman's career at 12 which lead her to do films such as Heat, Star War Prequel Trilogy and Mars Attack!.Leon is a simple story, an American remake of Nikata, and follows the story of Leon, a mafia assassin. It has an action packed start, showing how good an assassin Leon was. At the same time Mathilda is a rebellious child who smoke, swore, skipped school, but also abused by her parents and sister. However she loves her brother and both Leon and Mathilda had a soft spot for each other. When Mathilda was out of the apartment building a corrupt team of DEA agents led by Gary Oldman killed her family and she goes to Leon for safety and interrupt his very private live. Leon takes the girl under his wing, tries her up to be an assassin and she starts to fall in love with Leon. It is debatable whether it was just love between a father and daughter or something more extreme. Mathilda tries to kill the DEA agents who killed her family and the film leads to a dramatic climax.As I said the film works because it is simple and it focuses on the characters. It tries to be fairly realistic and is small scale, it could have been easy to make the film more epic but it wouldn't have worked. It also a fairly low budget and Luc Besson makes full use of it. Leon has been fairly influential, showing that these sorts of films can be made with an indie spirit and has influential ideas such as the Hit-man games.

Sound weird? Well, it is, and there are some huge logic jumps and gaping plot holes. But the film disarms those potential problems by never pretending to be the world as we know it, but creating a heightened, strange, through- the-looking-glass reality where hit men are sweet softies at heart, and New York cops are not only corrupt but openly bat-sh@t insane, gunning down whomever gets in their way with gleeful abandon. Gary Oldman goes way, way over the top as the baddie, and is a blast in the process. Jean Reno creates some real pathos in his sad faced, killer, who is so alone that he's almost child-like in his having to learn to relate to another human, and Natalie Portman gives a shockingly complex performance for an actress so young, playing so tricky a role.

83,NateWatchesCoolMovies,One of my favourite films of all time,10,16 June 2016,"Leon The Professional is purely and simply one of the best films ever made. From Natalie Portman's stunning debut performance, to Gary Oldman's absolutely nightmarish baddie, to Jean Reno's lovable and eccentric protagonist, it's a classic, a piece of achingly beautiful cinema that I could watch on the daily and never get tired of. The three actors are the bricks which make the film so special, and Luc Besson's fluid, sensitive direction is the mortar which holds them together. Portman is simply miraculous in her first film role as Matilda, a young girl whose entire family is murdered by psychotic DEA agent Norman Stansfield (Oldman). Highly introverted assassin Leon (Reno), takes pity and allows the orphaned girl into his home and his life. Matilda is a strange girl whose specific idiosyncrasies both clash and amusinly interact with Leon's. He is an exile of sorts as well, with a tragic past and not a whole lot going on in his life besides the contracts he carries out for kindly, paternal mobster Tony (a phenomenal Danny Aiello). Leon and Matilda makes an interesting team; she is brash, unfiltered and lively, he is reserved, awkward and deafeningly quiet, resulting in unique character building and bonding that Besson handles wonderfully. Now, there's two versions of this film, because apparently American people can't handle slightly taboo undertones, even when they're handled in a caring and tasteful manner. You definitely want to see the longer, European cut which has some interesting scenes that crackle with sexual tension on Portman's part. Yes, she's twelve years old, at a very confusing crossroads of her life, the stark black and white mindset of a child dissolving into the very ambiguous and complex psyche of a woman. She believes she loves Leon, and he handles her advances in a way that requires maturity and intuition that he never had to begin with, but rises to the occasion. Call these scenes what you will, but there's no denying their esential place in the film's complete story, and to censor them for the sake of prudeness is a straight up crime. Matilda wants revenge against Stansfield and his team, which means going up against his wrath, and also means Portman sharing some incredible scenes with a voracious Oldman. Oh, Gary. This is his final form, the most terrifying villain in his stable, a flamboyant, deranged lunatic that one can scarce believe ever was allowed to be a cop. There's a fairy tale esque feel to the film, where the bad guys do what they want in the urban forest, never in uniform and free to roam, kill and terrorize with the full might of the NYPD at their dastardly disposal. Oldman is the Joker on mescaline, and in fact Stansfield pops mysterious pills from a little casket, when he's not murdering people while listening to Beethoven. He's loud, scary, stylish and animalistic, so intense one feels like his very presence will melt the TV screen. Portman is so superb it's hard to believe this was so early on in her career. In my mind she did her best work right out of the gate, in this film. Matilda is wise for her years, which she uses to mask the gulf of vulnerability residing in her, a hallmark trait found in children from abusive households. The family and friendship she finds with Leon strengthens her as as human being, and we start to see the emerging person she will continue to grow up to be. Natalie displays all of this uncannily well, and is the bruised, beating heart at the centre oft the film. Reno sells the eccentricities (Leon loves golden age Hollywood musicals) and sorrowful resolve of Leon so well, taking a character that is all action and very little talk, and speaking volumes with both body language and silence which, take it from me, is tough stuff. Besson, whether directing a quiet, introspective scene or a balletic action sequence, gives everything a stylized, earthy quality that makes the film stand out amongst other action ventures. You could spend a billion dollars on production design, but it all comes down to the human element behind the wheel, and if you don't have a director, cast and team that has the current running through them to create something special, all those dollars go out the window. This one has all of that, and is a solid gold classic.",Léon - The Professional

Appearantly you can visit police department shoot some cops in the middle of the day and no fuss about it. Whole film is full of unrealistic situations.

On forcing her way into his apartment and convincing him to let her stay, Mathilda attempts to persuade Leon to help her exact revenge on the killers.Jean Reno is perfect as the terse yet mysterious ""Leon"" of the title (also released as ""The Professional""), a master of his craft who features in much of the deadly, stimulating action. Gary Oldman is way over the top as the evil Stansfield, the bent, drugged out, highly charged cop who'll stop at nothing. Young Natalie Portman is most enjoyable as the world weary yet naive and impressionable Mathilda, and Danny Aiello lends support as crime boss Tony (""...nobody steals from old Tony"").Luc Besson directs with purpose and manages to create real suspense and tension, while supplying his viewers with enjoyable characters that are infinitely more likable than those in his flawed French thriller ""La Femme Nikita"". ""The Professional"" is never inspirational nor groundbreaking, but it is definitely entertaining.The movie's main and most obvious theme is revenge, yet while this remains the driving force of the narrative, Besson does not allow proceedings to become too one-directional as he offers up other topics of interest such as people's need to be needed and a child's need for a sturdy father figure.A surprising, not so predictable conclusion also helps this pic's cause immensely.Friday, March 10, 1995 - Quality Hotel Maingate, Anaheim",Léon - The Professional
86,fertilecelluloid,"Erotic, funny, violent action fantasy",9,15 February 2006,"Leon (Jean Reno), a child-like assassin, becomes the protector of Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a precocious child whose parents are brutally murdered. Expanding on themes first explored in his ""La Femme Nikita"", Luc Besson's ""Leon"" (aka ""The Professional"") is one the most potent, audacious action fantasies ever branded to celluloid. Primarily, it is a love story that walks a delicate generational line and supports its basic narrative with provocative imagery, beautifully staged action, and simmering erotic tension. Portman is quite incredible as the strong-willed Mathilda and is a joy to watch as she naively seduces Reno into agreeing to father her. Reno, as the simple, boyish Leon, is thoroughly convincing and engaging in a difficult, ambiguous role. Though set (but not totally shot) in New York, the film has a strong European flavor and mixes Hong Kong-style action with intimate, cool drama that is often very funny. Eric Serra's moody score is a major contributor to the film's unique tone while Bjork's sensational ""Venus As A Boy"" is a stunning counterpoint to the darkness swirling around the characters. The events of the film are not realistic and there is a strained logic one must ignore in order to buy into the stylized reality. The extended cut focuses more heavily on Leon teaching Mathilda the tricks of his trade and amps up the erotic tension with a drunken dinner scene. Superb.",Léon - The Professional
87,Agent10,A perfect ten from Agent 10,10,18 April 2002,"-May contain Spoilers-I originally watched the US version of the film, The Professional, and thought the movie as it was was superb. Then, lo and behold, I found the European version of the film, which seemed to show everywhere but here in the US. Let's just say, I'm going to send a nasty letter to the MPAA someday soon.First of all, I could see the whole ""sexual tension"" between Mathilda and Leon as unusual, but that's what harnessed the energy of this film. Why wouldn't someone feel attached to a person who saved their life? Also, the Russian roulette (which, amazingly, is called American Roulette in Russia) scene was top notch, something that should never have been taken out of the film.Anyhow, enough with the pontification, and on with the review. Luc Besson could win Oscars and awards for the rest of his life, and this would still be his greatest work ever. Granted, Nikita was just as good, but this film had more clarity, a betterscript and Gary Oldman. Jean Reno is one of the most under appreciated actors in the world, forced to prostitute himself in films like Godzilla and Rollerball to keep food on the table. Thankfully, he will always have this movie to look upon. For any who haven't seen the 133-minute version of the film, go and find the European version. You may be forced to shell out a little more money, but in the end, it will be worth it.",Léon - The Professional

Also, I wasn't keen on the ending.It's definitely a different story in most respects which is refreshing and as a film of this genre, personally I am glad that it was as tame as it was, even with its 18 rating. Gun fights I can cope with, but some of the stuff towards the beginning could have been a bit grim and the relationship could have been very sick indeed, but it's quite a surreal little tale and could almost be a comedy. A 12 year old who makes friends with an assassin and has visions of becoming one herself. It would make a great late night cartoon following 'Rick & Morty' or 'South Park'.All in all, it's done well and I don't know what it could have done to impress me more. It doesn't really suit my typical tastes anyway, I'm more romance, comedy and sci-fi, but I think that I may have put too much pressure on it to blow me away, having seen it on so many lists of great films. After all these years of getting around to seeing it, it's effects may be somewhat diminished compared to my reaction had I seen it before.It's a good film of its type.",Léon - The Professional

Leon is a very simple man from a poor background in Sicily, and although highly disciplined, comes across as very honest and caring. The slightly precocious Matilda is equally enigmatic, from a troubled background she is continually forced to rise above. Their relationship leaps off the screen from perfect performances, tugging our heartstrings. Gary Oldman also gives a no holds barred performance to create a supremely twisted character.

A wired cop (Gary Oldman) thrust Mathilda into his arms, and he became her protector and trainer.

These are the ingredients of Léon: The Professional, and they combine to make quite the tasty dish.This is definitely an action movie, but it's the non-action parts that make it so memorable. Most of them are between Léon and Mathilda. When he first passes her on the stairs with her cigarette and bruises, or when he takes her up on the roof overlooking Central Park for her first real lesson. Scenes like these add a real emotional gravity to the movie, which 75% of action flicks either don't even bother with, or give a half-hearted attempt at, at best. A lot of people may focus on only the violent or seemingly exploitative aspects of the film, but that means that they're missing out on something much deeper.As for flaws, Gary Oldman takes over-acting to a whole new level in this movie. Occasionally, that kind of thing is okay (or even a plus), but not here. This isn't The Fifth Element. He was too wacky to feel sinister or dangerous. Other than that, this is a fantastic movie that is worth adding to anyone's collection.",Léon - The Professional
93,philip_vanderveken,This movie will grab you by the throat and will not let go.,10,20 November 2004,"Léon is one of my favorite movies of all time although I'm not a fan of action movies at all. I've seen it already so many times and still I can't get enough of it. I don't know what it is that makes this movie so attractive. I guess it is because of the great acting by all actors and the fact that Besson has made a really surprising movie with characters who aren't what you would expect. Léon is a professional hit man, but he isn't cold hearted as you might think. He's a nice man who doesn't know how to read, who only drinks milk and who's best friend is a plant... Admit it, that's not what you would expect from a hit man. The same for Matilda, the 12-year old girl that he protects since her family was blown to pieces by a crazy Beethoven-loving drug lord. She's only 12, but she already acts like an adult and she wants to become a ""cleaner"" like Léon so she can take revenge on her little brother's murderers. This movie isn't just an action movie or a thriller. It's also a drama with a lot of comedy. You might think this wouldn't work out well, but it does. Don't ask me how, but Besson has made a solid movie out of it that will grab you by the throat from the first minute on, not to let you go until hours after it finished...

96,DeeNine-2,"A different kind of ""Lolita""?",7,14 November 2004,"Take away the elaborately staged shoot 'em ups and the spilled blood and the rest of the mayhem, and what we have here is a love story, of sorts.Jean Reno stars as Leon, a cold-blooded professional hit man sans people skills who doesn't know how to read. He plays a kind of reluctant Humbert Humbert to 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman in her screen debut), a kind of Lolita for the mean streets. Owing a little to Jodie Foster's portrayal of a street urchin/nymphet in Taxi Driver (1976) and not much to the teenaged stars of the two movie Lolitas (Sue Lyon and Dominique Swain) who were really too old to be genuine nymphets, Natalie Portman yearns to become a ""cleaner"" so that she can get revenge on Stansfield, a psycho drug enforcement agent who killed her little brother. Played with psychotic zest by Gary Oldman, Stansfield is the kind of guy who pops pills and delights in a Beethoven overture while he tortures his various victims.Okay, it is not surprising that this is more or less a French film done American style. After all the underlying story did not and will not ever play in the Heartland of America like a Chevy commercial. (It needed to be disguised as an action thriller.) After all Portman really IS 12-years-old (as Nabokov's Lolita was in the book) and she and Leon really do live together and declare their love for one another, although there is no sexual hanky-panky between hit man and pre-adolescent, and nary a kiss on the lips.What French director Luc Besson (best known in the States for his very interesting and original La Femme Nikita 1990) has accomplished here is a kind of elaborate joke on the movie establishment. He has made a cold-blooded killer into a sympathetic character and has played peek-a-boo with the censorship system with some ""cute"" shots of his very pretty little star. One wants to ask, ""What's a nice Jewish girl (Portman was born in Israel) like you doing in a movie like this?""What makes this movie work (if you can stomach the premise and the mayhem) is the fine acting by Reno, Portman and Oldman with support from Danny Aiello, and some really outrageous shtick infusing a quirky plot. Some highlights:The scene in which Mathilda goes to the concierge and declares proudly of Leon, ""He's not my father. He's my lover."" (And their subsequent hasty departure from the concierge's establishment.)Reno's obsession with milk drinking and with cleaning his plant (his only friend).Stansfield's predilection for touching his victims almost lovingly (like a carnivore) before or after he kills them and his bizarre body-shudder as he pops his pills. In the funniest and most crowd-pleasing scene in the movie, he lingers a little too long over the body of his last bloody victim, long enough to hear the fatal words, ""This is from Mathilda"" as he looks down to find a strange piece of metal in his hand... (Yes, this is really vague, but you have to see the scene to appreciate it, and anyway, I can't give it away in a review! Those who have seen the movie, know what I mean.)One last word: this is another of those ironic R-rated films in which one of its stars (Natalie Portman) would not be allowed into the movie theater to see her own film!Okay, one more last word: if you want to see how Natalie Portman has developed as an actress, in addition to her work in Star Wars and in Cold Mountain, see her in Anywhere But Here (1999) an entirely different sort of film in which she co-stars with Susan Sarandon.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!""

98,Screen_Blitz,Luc Besson's The Professional is powerfully crafted with sophistication and stunning fortitude that strikes hard,9,16 July 2017,"From French director Luc Besson, Leon: The Professional is an action film with a little more to bargain than a just a plethora of explosive action set pieces. It is a part-drama that strives for a sheer exploration in its characters and how their lives are changed when everything goes downhill. The alarming question implemented in this story is what would you be willing to do to protect someone who has seemingly lost everything. The answers lie within Besson's chillingly crafted action vehicle which bears a story of a relationship between a man with demons burning inside him and a preteen girl lost in a world of inconspicuous innocence, and their relationship is the emotional crux that activates the film's momentum. Making up the duo is French-born actor Jean Reno and young actress Natalie Portman, a youngster making her feature film debut. The performances along with Besson's uncompromising direction makes not a comfortable ride, but one that is nearly unforgettable. This film follows Leon (played by Jean Reno), an Italian-born immigrant and professional hit-man working under mobster Tony (played by Danny Aiello), who meets Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman), a lonely 12-year old girl living under the harsh conditions of her abusive father (played by Michael Badalucco), her snappy mother, her equally older sister, and her younger brother who seems to be only pleasant seed in the family. Mathilda spends her days smoking on the balcony and looking for work to do. When Leon witness the brutal murder of her family at the hands of gun-wielding goons lead by mob boss Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman), Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing and teaches her the basics of becoming a professional assassin. Along the way, an unexpected platonic relationship forms between the two.Many actions film set out to entertain audiences with explosive special effects and hyperkinetic atmosphere, but not in a way that this film does. Luc Besson eludes against the common action formula in favor for a more art-house approach, a method that transcends the movie into something more thoughtful, if not masterful. Besson is not quick to just jump straight into the action and lead the scene with loud, heart-stopping gun shootouts. He takes his steady time to dive deep into the characters including establishing their backgrounds and compound personalities, while accompanying the scenery with a riveting score by Eric Serra. The eponymous character Leon is portrayed as a man with brutality written on his forehead. He is a man who shoots and kills to survive against the evildoers who wrong him. But deep inside the mysterious man is a gentle soul who wishes for a peaceful life. His is solidly exhibits in scenes showing his loves for plants and of course, in more light-hearted scenes with Natalie Portman's Mathilda. When the two finally eventually form their bond, that is when the story strikes at the heart. Easily making their relationship uncomfortable to grasp would obviously be their hefty age difference, yet that is what makes things more interesting. Reno's performance really hits hard in soft scenes when he and Portman are bonding, as well as the more grim moments when he shows off his gripping ferocity when he is mowing down the bad guys. Along his side is Portman who, for her surprisingly young age, brightens the room with a gritty portrayal that wrings out maturity and humanity of her character. And the duo must come face-to-face with Stansfield who is granted with a vicious, yet enticingly strong portrayal by Gary Oldman. The tension between him and the title character greatly pays its dues in climatic action sequence at the end when the body count hits the towers and each character faces a blind date with fate. Leon: The Professional is a powerfully crafted action-drama hybrid by Luc Besson who takes the action genre and spins into a visceral cinematic treat. Besson proves himself as a filmmaker capable to wringing out true heart from a genre filled populated with big- budget action parades. It is an admirable piece of work, at least for those who can get past the violent nature of the story.",Léon - The Professional

This film's got cinemtic references, family bonding, regret of the past, and even a little girl trying to find her place in 90s Brooklyn. It's also got some FANTASTIC action sequences too.This would have been mundane had it been a movie from Hollywood directed by Brett Ratner or Michae Bay, and it shows that action cinema doesn't need to be beholden to action blockbuster stock characters.

100,oneguyrambling,An all time classic. A simple story about a very non-simple situation.,9,17 February 2012,"Jean Reno plays the titular character – regardless of the name on the spine of the DVD – he is both Leon and the Professional. A quiet intense man who lives a solitary existence of discipline and ritual, honing his skills as an assassin that leaves no trace and carries out his work cleanly and perfectly, a man with only two parameters to his work: 'No women. No kids.' When the family that lives next door in his modest apartment building is butchered by corrupt police after a drug deal gone wrong, leaving only 11 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), Leon has virtually no choice but to literally take her in, lest he break his own rules through deliberate inaction.In the days and weeks that follow, impressionable Mathilda – who feels she is wise beyond her years – comes to realise the enormity of her situation. This is only magnified when she learns of Leon's true occupation. Of course being no more than a kid, Mathilda hardly finds this news abhorrent, but decides that she wishes to learn the ropes of what Leon refers to as 'cleaning'.This leads to a strange new existence for Leon, he cannot force pre-teen Mathilda out into the real world, but allowing her to remain compromises his disciplined existence. The mismatched duo settle in to a 'Daddy / Daughter' relationship, with Mathilda remaining home while Leon heads off to 'work', the issue rapidly becomes that Mathilda rapidly starts seeing Leon as less of a Father figure, and more of a crush Seeing that Mathilda is so headstrong, determined and convincing, and that Leon is if anything slightly child-like and has been shielded from normal human relationships, Leon ultimately yields a little and tentatively commits to basic training; something his employer Tony (Danny Aiello) is rightfully doubtful of.Regardless of suitability or basic ethics, the Leon / Mathilda relationship evolves into a strange partnership, and bringing your (pseudo) daughter to work days take on strange and uncomfortable significance. As Mathilda develops new skills and confidences unbecoming of her fragile years it is more and more evident that her ultimate intent is to avenge the deaths of her family Which brings us to Mr Gary Oldman and his role as corrupt cop Stansfield.Stansfield works for the Drug Enforcement Agency in the police force, however his entire unit is entirely crooked. Oldman toes the fine line between over the top intensity and cartoonishness well for the most part, and I guess if you are looking to forgive some of his antics you could always point to the green and yellow capsules that he takes prior to his more 'memorable' sequences.What is undeniable is that the and inescapable routine that the reserved and measured Leon is bound by is an effective counterpoint to the haphazard and impetuous existence of Stansfield. Having initially innocent Mathilda embroiled between these ying and yang characters provides the film with a centre, and the inevitable feeling that all three characters will find themselves in the same place at the same time.Leon is full of long low key scenes with equally subtle background music, 90% of the dialogue is between Mathilda and Leon – with a good two thirds of each conversation dominated by the precocious child. These scenes are punctuated by sudden dramatic scenes of violence, especially as the film nears its conclusion and Mathilda finally learns that there are some things that kids shouldn't be subjected to regardless of how 'ready' they think they are.Leon: The Professional was directed and written by Luc Besson, who has managed to leave his fingerprints on several essential action flicks from the last couple decades, Taken, Kiss of the Dragon, The Transporter and Unleashed included. Leon seems to be quite a personal work, and while some of the other works listed are very good and worth checking out, in my mind Leon: The Professional stands head and shoulders above them all.This film granted both Gary Oldman and Jean Reno eternal credibility to a generation of young film-goers, and helped launch the career of Natalie Portman. For a moment it almost made me want to buy a skull cap Now nearly two decades on I am at odds with the more 'risky' scenes that further the on the job training and 'romantic' aspects of the storyline. I am by no means decrying their inclusion as being abhorrent or immoral, but I similarly don't really see them adding much to what was already an amazing and essential film.Final Rating – 9 / 10.

By the time Leon: The Professional will end, you won't be doubting that it's been made by a professional only. Hats off, Luc Besson!The film is a stylish actioner with plenty of action, drama and suspense in it. But what really surprised me was the little yet perfect amount of humor present in it (I watched the longer version so don't know if it exists in the theatrical version too). Instead of making it too dull with just dialogues, Luc Besson has relied on the characters more than the plot to keep the entertainment quotient going on. Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman have really impressed big time and delivered possibly their career best performances till date.Of course, it's very violent and also somewhat dark in nature, but aren't most hitman action movies like this, then? Fully realizing the characters, Besson has given us enough time to understand them while also delivering plenty of killer action sequences involving mostly gunplay and explosions: and the result is just outstanding!Leon is a hitman's emotional saga, and it's backed by a thread of strong emotions between the characters. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda will really get you involved, Stansfield will turn out to be one of the most terrific action movie villains of all time, and the film itself would be called one of the greatest action movies ever made.Looks like that happened a very, very long time ago.",Léon - The Professional

That's always been rare to find in action movies but it is virtually non-existent in the latest releases.As the story in 'Léon' develops, the action becomes more prevalent, and the final half an hour or so is almost exclusively action sequences. It builds the drama and tension with great effect and holds your attention effortlessly. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are both outstanding as Léon and Mathilda respectively, but my personal favourite performance was Gary Oldman as Stansfield - one of the best portrayals of a villain I think I've probably ever seen.I watched the extended version of this movie, which contains a few 'romance' scenes cut from the original release for being considered inappropriate. While I would agree that a middle-aged man having a romantic relationship with a young girl is definitely inappropriate it was never taken too far, though admittedly these scenes are quite creepy and uncomfortable to watch.",Léon - The Professional
105,mstomaso,One of the Best Action Films Ever Made!,10,24 July 2007,"Luc Besson's ""Leon"" AKA ""The Professional"" ranks in my top ten action films of all time, along with his ""La Femme Nikita"". The difference between Besson's films and standard action films is what Besson does with the rest of the story. His films feature intense character development and satisfying human plots. In both films, Besson's heroes are ruthless professional killers. Sympathy for Nikita develops because of her tragic struggle against her own history and psychology, while Leon's latent sense of justice, brought on by his innocent love for a 12 year old girl, makes this professional hit man truly heroic. Besson's action is over-the-top, wild and unrealistic, what makes his films so believable and so compelling is PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM - a much more engaging aspect of film than violence will ever be. Quentin Tarantino could learn much through a close study of Besson (though I am sure he has already done this) Leon is played by Jean Reno. Reno is a charismatic, under-appreciated physical actor, and his performance is wonderful. Natalie Portman, in her early teens, gives an amazing performance as ""Mathilda"" the character around whom the entire story revolves. And Gary Oldman is masterful as the despicable Stansfield. Oldman has given us so many remarkable performances over the years, that it is difficult to identify his most profound parts, but this is certainly among his most memorable.Mathilda is a troubled young girl whose family - who she is not very fond of - is about to get wiped out over a drug dispute. Leon is a professional killer who lives down the hall. When Mathilda's family is wiped out, Leon - and you get the feeling that this is the first time he has allowed himself to feel sympathy is many years - takes her in. Thus begins the love story, and the story of revenge that will drive the film's major themes and its plot. The story is beautifully filmed and exquisitely paced - you will be unable to take your eyes from the screen. The soundtrack is also excellent and wholly unobtrusive. The action scenes are memorable, affective, and tastefully subordinate to the story (take note Quentin). Directing A+ Script A+ Acting A+ Story A+ Cinematography A+ Sound/Music A+Very highly recommended.",Léon - The Professional
106,johno-21,Another impressive film from Luc Besson,9,5 April 2006,"I've only seen this once and need to see it again. This is a good film and before I saw it I understood it to be an action-type shoot-em-up film that I probably would have passed on but when I viewed it on television I found it to Be quite well done and an offbeat and interesting and compelling story about the emotionless professional hit-man and his 12 year old neighbor girl who is street savvy and although she has a father and step family she is more like an orphan and a society dropout before becoming a teenager. The hit-man himself is like a big kid at times and delivers his role more through expression and body language than with dialog. The third central character is the dirty cop. French film heavy Jean Reno is Léon, Natalie Portman in her film debut is Mathilda and Gary Oldman is Stansfield star along with Danny Aiello and Peter Appel. Nikta director and writer Luc Besson has a mostly French crew of filmmakers with him here including cinematographer Thierry Arbogast who photographed the Besson films Nakita, The Messenger, Angela, The Fifth element and the soon to be released Arthur and the Minimoys. The great sound to this film is done by a sound team led by veteran Francois Groult. The production designer Dan Weil, worked with the prolific writer/director/producer Besson on several films. I would like to see this on a big screen and see the version that apparently is 24 minutes longer than the version I must have seen. As it is I would give this a 9.0 out of 10.",Léon - The Professional
107,educallejero,It's a poorly done fantasy,1,13 March 2021,"The characters are ridiculously cartoonish, because the important part here is the fantasy about a romance between a childish adult man and a ""mature for her age"" young girl.But with a pathetically basic story poorly developed (if developed at all), bad dialogue (for the most part), romantic scenes in the middle of cold ""ugly"" violence, and surreal characters that suck and have no grow or depth (or both), this is just a poorly done fantasy instead of the exploration of a complicated or questionable relationship.",Léon - The Professional
108,Stampsfightclub,character driven crime film,9,19 December 2007,"After seeing Air Force One, I became a massive fan of Gary Oldman. And although he isn't in this film as much as I would have liked, he performs superbly alongside other great actors in Jean Reno and Natalie Portman to bring this intriguing crime film to life.Reno stars as hit-man Leon who takes in young Natalie after her family is killed. There, she wants to learn the tricks of the trade.At first I wasn't too sure what was happening. A lot of different stories were taking place with many very different types of characters but as the film progressed I began to understand every character and appreciate each situation in which they were involved in.This film works really well in character development. The beginning of the film is well pitched to slowly introduce the characters gradually and as the situations progress; the audience can appreciate their unique situations. It is a truly marvellous character development film.Many crime films such as James Bond try to explore all the different types of genre in crime, action, thriller, spy and mystery. But Leon is very specific towards the spy genre. It doesn't go off exploring others which makes the film very unique. The specifics are wonderful, especially with the central protagonist in Leon, who is well suited to the role of hit-man. It allows the audience to appreciate the specific genre.The realism too works well as there are no over the top scenes with ridiculous car chases and questionable actions. It is all put together so well that it is understandable, energetic but quiet and most of all enjoyable.The acting by everyone involved is superb, none more so than young Natalie Portman who portrays the troubled child so well. Reno and Oldman also fit their roles so perfectly.The plot is slow moving, focusing on the characters extremely well and is a joy to watch. Watch out for ""the plant"" which is a lovely little side story.a must watch for all spy lovers :)",Léon - The Professional
109,adamscastlevania2,A faultless crime classic,10,22 September 2014,"(93%) A sublime crime drama with a cold heart of pure gold, a fast pace, some high tension, and a unique approach to its ideas. The mix of French charm and style with American cinema combine perfectly making this a truly different breed of film that just has to be admired. Jean Reno is perfect in the lead role (except for maybe the fact that he's clearly French and not even trying an Italian accent), Gary Oldman plays one of the best film baddies ever, and Natalie Portman was destined to become a star after her fine performance. This is a true must-watch classic that should be counted amongst the all-time greats and a top ten pick from the 1990's.",Léon - The Professional
110,Bob-45,The Assassin Next Door Makes for a Great Movie,10,1 May 2000,"This review is for the International (Director's Cut) of the movie. I gave the US version, ""The Professional"" a ""7"". The additional scenes in ""Leon"" masterfly flesh out the movie. This is now the most intimate and beautiful action/adventure film I've ever seen.This film opens simply, with ""contract negotiations"" between an Italian mobster and a hit-man. However, this scene plays right out of a Sergio Leone western. Complete with extreme closeups, clipped dialogue, and quick cuts, the movie grabs us from the opening frame. Following the ""contract,"" the hit-man dispatches roughly a half-dozen baddies in fast-paced and clever fashion. One the ""hit"" is accomplished, we meet the hit-man, the sad-eyed laconic Leon. Leon doesn't live; he exists. He's not cold, just ""dead"" of any feelings but melancholy. Into his life comes Matilda (Natalie Portman), a beautiful twelve year-old, far too worldly for her years. Matilda, like most girls her age isa child-woman whom has seen and experienced far too much, yet has maintained spiritual innocence, even if her body has been violated and abused. CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD. When Matilda family is murdered by the hopped-up, psychotic Stansfield, she turns to Leon for help. Leon discovers emotions he has forgotten. Leon remembers how to love unselfishly. The two most beautiful scenes in the film are between Matilda and Leon. In the first Matilda pleads with Leon to let her in after the murder of her family. In the second, Matilda, negotiates with Leon, offering to serve him in exchange for his protection and to help him avenge the death of her little brother. Portman is masterful in expressing the anguish of a young woman will to use any means (including, reluctantly, her body) to get what she needs. One can almost forgive Portman for her present blatant hypocrisy on the gun issue, given the amount of firepower she associates herself with here, as this is the finest performance by a young actress I've seen. ""Leon"" unspokenly asks you to reexamine your values. I loved Leon and Matilda despite Leon's trade and Matilda's bloodthirsty desire vengeance. The added footage in the international version solidifies the bond between Leon and Matilda, and, vicariously the audience. The ending, thus because as poignant as it is exciting.I've never seen another action film quite like ""Leon,"" and I know I've never loved a movie more. Think of ""Leaving Las Vegas"" meets ""Die Hard."" I give ""Leon"" a ""10"".",Léon - The Professional
111,tbills2,"Awesome movie, but too overrated on IMDb Top250.",1,3 July 2010,"I went to look up 'The Professional' thinking I was looking up one of the most underrated, cultural classic films ever. Then I saw the rating - 8.6. What... Now I realize that 'The Professional' is the most overrated movie on this entire Top250 list. An 8.6! That is absurd! Do not get me wrong, this movie is so great. Gary Oldman is my favorite actor. This is maybe his best performance. All of his scenes are fantastic. It is all of the scenes without Gary Oldman that I have a problem with. What is so 8.6 great about the give and take between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman's characters, which essentially dominates the film. Those scenes are sort of boring. The story is too over the top too, and the things that happen and the things that the characters do seem too unbelievable. The action is not all that believable either, although it is very well done. As great as Gary Oldman's character is in this movie, he does not elevate it enough to be listed as a top 30 movie of all-time. I am laughing at that rating. This flick should be in that 7.9 to 8.2 realm, not 8.6! I would truly give this movie an 8 out of 10 rating, it was an awesome action-drama, but I got to give it a flat 1 out of 10, just because so many people drastically overrate this film.According to the Top250, 'The Professional' is better than 'Saving Private Ryan', 'Gladiator', 'Braveheart', 'Aliens', 'The Departed', 'L.A. Confidential', 'American Beauty', 'Unforgiven', 'Die Hard', 'Heat', 'Fargo', 'The Lion King', 'The Sting', 'Raging Bull' and about 50 other movies it shouldn't be in front of. Ch'ya!

114,agmoldham,An unusual friendship,8,15 February 2004,Leon is the story of a friendship that develops between a hitman Leon and a 12 year old girl called Mathilda. A corrupt government official slays the young girls family including her young brother who is the only one she  was particularly close to. She vows revenge for her brother and learns the ropes from Leon.This is a very well directed and acted film. It's strange to see Natalie Portman is her pre Star Wars days and she proves here that she can certainly act. It's a shame that hasn't shone through to the Star Wars films yet. Jean Reno is excellent as the lead character and you can't help but think that hit men probably are as lonesome as Leon in real life. Gary Oldman is also excellent as the corrupt agent in a role that he's pretty much made for. Great Movie 9/10,Léon - The Professional
115,Vivekmaru45,Jean Reno Is My Hero For Life!!!,10,16 February 2011,"This is the first Jean Reno film I saw. After this one, I saw many of his other films as well. BUT THIS ONE IS MY FAVORITE! The role fits him like a glove, and it seems to me to be made only for him. He gives us his emotional best in the film.The other great star in this film that complements him is Natalie Portman who plays her film debut at 12 years of age. Natalie plays the role of Mathilda, Leon's (Jean Reno) neighbour. Her acting is simply phenomenal. But like most child stars (a good example is Macaulay Culkin (Home Alone)) she does not do well as an adult actress. Anyway this IS HER BEST FILM.Now we are going to say something about the super actor called Gary Oldman. He is SUPER!!! My god I haven't seen anyone act like this before. This guy really gets into the act!!! This is ALSO HIS BEST FILM.Now when the 3 actors above all give their best, enough is said.Full Plot: Leone ""Léon"" Montana (Jean Reno) is a hit-man (or ""cleaner,"" as he refers to himself) living a solitary life in New York City's Little Italy. His work comes from a mafioso named Tony (Danny Aiello), who operates from the ""Supreme Macaroni Company"" restaurant. Léon spends his idle time engaging in calisthenics, nurturing a houseplant that early on he describes as his ""best friend,""[3] and (in one scene) watching old Gene Kelly musicals.On a particular day, he meets Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a twelve-year-old girl with a black eye and smoking a cigarette, living with her dysfunctional family in an apartment down the hallway. Her abusive father and self-involved mother aren't even aware that Mathilda has stopped attending class at her upscale school.Mathilda's father (Michael Badalucco) attracts the ire of corrupt DEA agents, who have been paying him to store cocaine in his residence, after they discover that he has been stealing some of the drugs for himself. A cadre of DEA agents storm the building, led by a sharp-suited and drug-addicted Norman ""Stan"" Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who murders Mathilda's entire family, missing her only because she was out shopping when they arrived. When she returns and notices the carnage, she calmly continues down the hallway and receives sanctuary from a reluctant Léon.Mathilda discovers that Léon is a hit-man. She begs him to become her caretaker and to teach her his skills as a ""cleaner;"" she wants to avenge the murder of her four-year-old brother, the only member of her family she loved. Léon shows her how to use firearms, including a scoped rifle. In return, she offers her services as a maid and teacher, remedying Léon's illiteracy. Mathilda admits to Léon several times that she is falling in love with him, but he says nothing back.After increasing her experience with firearms, Mathilda fills a shopping bag with guns from Léon's collection and sets out to kill Stansfield. She bluffs her way into the DEA office by posing as a delivery person, only to be ambushed by Stansfield in a bathroom. Léon, discovering her intentions in a note left for him, rushes to rescue Mathilda, shooting two of Stansfield's men in the process.Stansfield is enraged that what he calls the ""Italian hit-man"" has gone rogue. He threatens Tony, coercing him into surrendering Léon's whereabouts. As soon as Mathilda returns home from grocery shopping, an NYPD ESU team, sent by Stansfield, takes her hostage and attempts to infiltrate Léon's apartment. Léon ambushes the ESU team and barters one agent for Mathilda's freedom. In the apartment, Léon creates a quick escape for Matilda by chopping a hole in a slender air shaft. He reassures her and tells her that he loves her, moments before the police come for him.In the chaos that follows, Léon sneaks out of the apartment building disguised as a wounded ESU officer. He is unnoticed save for Stansfield, who recognizes the hit-man and shoots him. Stansfield jeers him haughtily. Léon places an object in Stansfield's hands, which he explains is ""from Mathilda,"" then he dies. Opening his hands, Stansfield recognizes it as the pin from a grenade. He rips open Léon's vest to discover several grenades on his chest, right before a massive explosion kills him.Mathilda heads to Tony's place as she was instructed to do by Léon. Tony will not give Mathilda more than a small amount of the fortune Léon had amassed, which Tony was holding for him. He offers a monthly allowance and says school should be her priority for now. Mathilda asks Tony to give her a job, insisting that she can ""clean"" as Léon had. Tony sternly informs her that he ""ain't got no work for a 12-year-old kid!"" Having nowhere else to go, Mathilda makes her way to New Jersey in an attempt to return to school. After telling her and Léon's story to the headmistress, and seemingly being readmitted, Mathilda walks into a field near the school with Léon's houseplant in hand. She digs a hole and plants it, as she had told Léon he should, ""to give it roots.""Verdict: 10/10. Buy the FULL UNCUT EDITION on DVD",Léon - The Professional
116,ajs-10,Rapidly becoming a classic,9,27 July 2010,"As this is my 100th film of the year I decided I would watch one of my all-time favourites. I have not seen Leon in quite a few years and so it was nice to become reacquainted with this classic. It's not perfect, I know, but, to me, it will always be one of Luc Besson's best.Leon is a loner and a hit-man; he lives in an apartment in New York next door to the twelve year old Mathilda and her family. He gets his work from Italian mob boss, Tony. Mathilda's father is into some shady drug dealings that land him in trouble with the rather psychotic Stansfield and his gang. She is out getting groceries when Stansfield calls and shoots her entire family. On returning she takes refuge in Leon's apartment. Despite initial reservations, Leon takes her in and they move to a hotel. Mathilda swears revenge on the killers, mainly because one of the victims was her four-year-old brother. She asks Leon to teach her to do what he does for a living. Leon teaches her the basics and the pair grows closer as they learn to live with each other. Mathilda teaches him to read and he begins to not feel quite so lonely any more. On a visit to her former home Mathilda learns just who Stansfield is and what he does for a living. This is where things really get interesting, and this is where I will end my short synopsis.This is a really well made film with a great soundtrack, there are a couple of songs, but the original score is great. As with all the Luc Besson films I've seen there is always an element of humour in the main characters and this is no different. Tremendous performances from both Jean Reno as Leon and Natalie Portman as Mathilda. Gary Oldman is his usual 'over the top' self as the psychotic Stansfield and Danny Aiello is also very good as Tony.I really engaged with the characters of Leon and Mathilda. You really believe that what they feel for each other is true. There is always a certain sense of style about a Luc Besson film, something I have not seen in the films of any other director. As I said at the beginning, this film is not perfect, but it will always be one of my favourites. It still stands up fifteen years after its release. For me: always recommended.My score: 8.5/10",Léon - The Professional
117,TheNorthernMonkee,The ultimate hitman movie? Absolutely brilliant,10,17 August 2004,"SPOILERSFor pushing 1,000 years, there was an almost constant bitter rivalry between the English and the French. Whilst this rivalry officially ended in 1904 with the signing of the Entente Cordialle, an unofficial line of continued rivalry has continued to modern day. In the build up to 2004's Football European Championships, television began to broadcast an advert for England versus France. This advert focused on a Frenchman and an Englishman contesting which country was best by listing possitive and negative aspects of their countries. This irritating, if slightly amusing, advert missed one aspect however. Simply put, it missed out one of the greatest things to come out of France in years, that is the work of Luc Besson. ""Leon"" is arguably Besson's best work, and it is by far and away his most well known piece of directing and writing on the other side of the British Channel.In this film, Besson has recruited Casablanca born Jean Reno to play the title character of Leon. Leon is a ""cleaner"" who is paid by his friend Tony to solve problems as it were and to kill enemies. One day Leon's neighbour is killed by corrupt Police Officials (lead by Gary Oldman's superb Norman Stansfield), and Leon saves the life of the neighbour's daughter Mathilda (Natalie Portman's film debut). As Mathilda faces up to the death of her family, and Leon faces up to this sudden introduction of company into his life, the two slowly bond as Leon shows Mathilda how to ""clean"".The beauty of this film, evident from the very start, is the way in which it is filmed. Given a rugged feel and a very dark look, ""Leon"" follows a lot of French film techniques in it's filming and makes us feel closer to the characters in this harsh reality. At the beginning of the film, Mathilda asks Leon if life is always so difficult, to which he states it is. By using the gritty camera direction and by using filthy, miserable sets, Besson shows life to be as challenging as it really can be.As well as the way the film is shot, the other joy of this film is the three main actors and their wonderful performances. Natalie Portman at the young age of 12 or 13, is superb in her big screen debut and proves yet again that children can be decent actors too. Alongside her, Jean Reno is simply glorious. With his little hat and his dark glasses, when ""cleaning"" Reno gives an air of professionalism (the American title for this film being ""The Professional""), whilst without his glasses, his eyes show a sense of almost child like naivety. Reno manages to portray a character who is at times aware and at others completely dumb to the world around him. This mixture means that we find it impossible to not feel for the man as he is slowly brought out of his shell by his young friend.In comparison to the performances of the innocent Mathilda and Leon, Gary Oldman gives us an extreme, disturbing picture of a turbulant man with powerful tastes in music and an even more powerful sense of psychotic tendencies. Twice during the film, Oldman's detective, an apparent drug addict, takes a pill and shudders in delight as he receives a shock to the system. With the sweet bond between Mathilda and Leon, the evil Agent Stansfield is superb as a counterbalance between two sides as morality and what is right are merged between the evil cop and the good hitman.With Besson's majestic plot and directing, ""Leon"" was always going to be a good film. Add to this, some brilliant performances by Portman, Reno and Oldman, and it is no wonder that this film is sometimes referred to as a classic. ""Leon"" is by far and away the greatest hitman movie of alltime, and a reminder that sometimes the French can be the best at things.",Léon - The Professional
118,FilmOtaku,"A very different film from the ""original"" cut",7,8 April 2004,"Possible SpoilersHaving seen `The Professional' enough times to be able to not only recite the dialogue from memory and pretty much act out the scenes, watching `Leon', Luc Besson's director's cut is like experiencing almost an entirely different film  and a better one at that.  While there was a hint of infatuation for the French professional hitman by his young protégée in the first cut, it's way out in the open here.  Matilda's role as a protégé is also expanded when she not only learns more about his business, but participates and assists in the hits as well.  The acting, which I found impressive originally, is obviously equally good  especially with Oldman  he chews the scenery so well you can't help but smile, even though he's terrifying.  If I had to choose which of these two excellent films is the better, I would have to choose this director's cut, merely for the chances it takes, but I would recommend seeing both because the additions and subtractions make them two very different films.--Shelly",Léon - The Professional
119,jpschapira,"Besson, the writer/director",9,21 August 2008,"Not every day you see a film that shows, as its opening credits, the actors who star in it, the composer of its score and its writer and director. Those are the only things we see at the beginning of Luc Besson's ""Léon"". Besson, a master filmmaker, a man involved in everything that has to do with movies, a movie lover himself, achieves here what lot of people only dream of; and completes his best film.Taking into account what he's done since, I can be honest and tell you that I haven't seen the four films he directed after ""Léon"", all of which have nothing to do with the movie. Considering what he did before I reaffirm my statement, admiring his accomplishment because of the challenge he assumed. If you know Besson, you know there's the producer, the writer and the director. ""Léon"" is the perfect combination of the two latter functions, previously seen in films mostly done in France (even though ""Le grand bleu"" takes us to various places of the Earth). At this film's opening scene, we're in the United States-it doesn't matter where exactly-and the hit-man Léon (Jean Reno) is talking to his Tony (Danny Aiello), apparently his boss, who's telling him about a job. The style of Besson instantly recognizable, with cinematographer Thierry Arbogast (from ""Nikita"") putting in the close-ups to Aiello and Reno's faces and setting the mood. The dialog is quick, sharp. Jean Reno doesn't speak the best English, but his character doesn't require that he does, and it's Besson's merit to confide the role to Reno, who does a perfectly convincing job playing a very difficult character. You see, Besson the writer (and the director too, of course) is a magnificent storyteller. The main character of this movie is not your everyday hit-man, with no feelings and/or psychological disorders: he is just lonely and timid and, though not less serious, he goes to the cinema and watches classics like ""Singing in the rain"". His only friend is a plant and his boss, Tony, with whom he shares a relationship like the one Besson would later detail in his script of that strangely good movie ""Danny the Dog"", shared by Jet Li and Bob Hoskins.The other relationship Besson writes and details in ""Léon"" is the one between the hit-man and a little girl that will unexpectedly become a part of his life. Her name is Matilda, and she's played by Natalie Portman at the age of 13 in one of those performances (like the one of Anna Paquin in ""The Piano"") that let you predict the kind of actress someone will turn out to be; a wonderfully original construction of a plausible, mature for her age, charming and desperate human being. I want to leave all the scenes both of the characters share for you to discover. I'll only mention one, just to make reference to my admiration towards Besson's accomplishment with his best movie. In the scene, Mathilda suggest that they play a game. Instantly, she puts different costumes on (we never know exactly where they come from, but it doesn't matter), so Léon can guess who she's imitating. She does Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Chaplin; and then Léon does John Wayne. This is Besson's homage to the American culture, to American films and characters he admires. And it's not the only one, neither the only moment; in fact, Reno's Léon is his personal and free of compromise version of all the Michael Corleones and Travis Bickles of the world, just to mention a couple of names of characters that don't even kill people for a living. In that aspect, Besson the writer and the director unite, and we get the writer/director; the storyteller and the atmosphere creator. It's not for nothing that the only name we see of his crew besides his is Eric Serra's. Serra's music, a crucial element in Besson's filmography, takes the lead here again, sounding at full force when its required, building the atmosphere and the tension alongside Besson in the perfect action sequences and not doing anything when emotions and close-ups speak for themselves. The movie also makes room for beautiful shots in little unexpected moments and exploits the talent of Gary Oldman as an overacted villain that could well be a ridiculed version of the serious villains out there. Understand that Besson never intends for the viewer to believe the film's situations (something he would aim for in a film like ""Le grand bleu"") and their sometimes impossible resolutions (here the word storyteller fits him perfectly), but in the midst of everything we do, or at least we want to. And the credit is all his.",Léon - The Professional
120,Atreyu_II,Good for an action film,7,5 September 2010,"Although this might seem just another movie which everything happens in America, it was however directed by a french director (Luc Besson). Plus, Jean Reno's accent is clearly french (yet his character's name - Leon - sounds Italian or even Spanish).This film is also known by the alternative title 'Leon: The Professional'. Its title obviously refers to the film's main character: Leon, a professional hit-man (or ""cleaner"", as he says). Leon is a different kind of hit-man: he does his daily life like a normal person in some ways, he lives all alone, he enjoys watching Gene Kelly's musicals and at the same time he is eccentric to the point of having a houseplant as his best friend (LOL!).Leon, despite being a criminal, is actually pretty cool and likable. Besides, his french accent is cool and his voice is nothing of what you might think. The way he talks is usually very calm and cool and he rarely speaks aggressively.The movie takes place in Little Italy, an area in New York City. The modern scenario is one of its qualities and certain angles of view are exceptionally well filmed, which contributes for a nice visual experience.As a movie, it is so modern even now and it shows how messed up this world really is.This was Natalie Portman's feature film debut in the role of Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl from a dysfunctional family and already smoking cigarettes. She and Leon are actually neighbors. But soon Mathilda's entire family is shot to death, including her much beloved 4-year-old brother. They don't actually show her brother being shot (likely for obvious reasons), but still it's horrible to know that that cute and loving little kid is murdered. That is, without a doubt, the saddest and most horrifying part of the film.Mathilda is the only survivor because she was out shopping when it happened. Mathilda then seeks sanctuary on Leon. She soon finds out what he does for a living, however begs him to take care of her and protect her, as well as to teach her how to be like him (a ""cleaner""), so that she can avenge the murder of her little brother.Mathilda even falls in love with Leon, but he doesn't feel the same way about her, so nobody can say that this movie deals with a certain inappropriate subject. On this, however, Mathilda's behavior is questionable and inappropriate at times.Too bad that Leon dies in the end. But on the positive side, the bad guys are killed as well. The song at the end (Sting's ""Shape of my Heart"") is a good song.Natalie Portman and Jean Reno have good performances. Natalie Portman, here as a younger girl, has a haircut that I just don't like at all. But she already had all the traces of a young girl who was gonna grown into a hot woman. Gary Oldman's performance was awful and his character was so annoying and so devilish that I kept wanting him to be brutally ""cleaned"" by Leon or Mathilda.So, in conclusion, an interesting and intriguing action film, one of the best of its kind, but long and somehow overvalued. It also deals with serious subjects, such as corruption, crime, violence and revenge. There is also brutal violence in this.",Léon - The Professional

A gritty, hard movie about gritty hard people. This film is dark, brooding, intense; it is hard to watch at times and difficult to call enjoyable, but the story is still powerful. The trains of righteousness can't be stopped and their movement brings about reactive forces in the people they affect. I know places and people that might pass for the world in this movie. I have witnessed people fall apart because of those around them. The acting is effective. This is the kind of film that proves that a small story can be much more meaningful than a larger one.

It is the acting of two principal actors, Mr. Reno I like very much from the times of La Femme Nikita, he is a spectacular actor, especially in the roles like these. Natalie Portman is also excellent in a role like this, later in the Star Wars I did not like her that much. I think as a young teenager in this film she is excellent, for the later roles I am not that sure.Things I did not like. Plot is not realistic. I simply do not like that. When is something like this possible in the real life? Never. Also too much violence, but films of Luc Besson are always like that. I guess it has to be that way. Violence and sex sells.

124,tm-sheehan,How could I have missed this movie!,9,5 September 2019,"One of the best parts of sharing movie recommendations is when a friend introduces you to a movie you've missed at the Cinema.
Thanks Stephanie for recommending the1994 movie Leon The Professional.My review 9/10How did I miss this movie? It amazes me how many movies there's still left for me to see.
Natalie Portman was 13 years old when she made this movie.
It was her movie debut and what a debut it is. She plays Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is reluctantly taken in by Léon, a professional assassin, after her family is murdered.
Léon and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the assassin's trade.Yes of course there's guns and violence but this movie has a heart and the intelligence and beauty of Natalie Portman's performance is possibly the best adolescent acting portrayal I've ever seen on film .No wonder she's had the career she has had and
is the first person born in the 1980s to have won the Academy Award for Best Actress (for Black Swan (2010)).The 3 main male leafs in this movie are all excellent also , especially Jean Reno as Leon , his relationship with Mathilda is touching and sensitive and gives an award winning performance.
How can a professional assassin training a 12 year old girl in the same profession be touching I hear you ask ?, you'll have to see the Movie to find out.Garry Oldman such a fine Actor plays a mentally deranged menacing mob boss with demonic charm who hums Beethoven for thrills as he dispatches his enemies and competition and shows no pity be they man woman or child.Danny Aeillo as Tony , Leon's Italian friend and confidant is also excellent .Written and Directed by Luc Besson this is a movie not to be missed but be warned it is violent in parts but no more than any crime show or movie you'll see on television tonight.
The performances are all superb, especially Natalie Portman.",Léon - The Professional
125,bopdog,Different movie now than in 1994-- Besson's artistic vision is now understood,9,16 December 2001,"I just saw ""Leon"" on DVD. Missed it in the theaters. I read some reviews (now, in late 2001), and noticed that some respected reviewers were properly concerned about the young age of the heroine, the then 12 year-old Natalie Portman. Funnily, those 1994 concerns were washed away by events since 1994. Natalie grew up: Now she's un-twisted, wholesome, and gorgeous (and adult). Luc Besson, the director, made ""The Fifth Element,"" among others. With ""Element"" we see a definite trend emerging in Besson's work. Some of the scenes in ""Leon"" were EXACTLY like some of the scenes in ""Element""-- same Moroccan music, same words, similar casting, same vibe.Not that it's a bad thing. Just notice that with ""Leon"" in 1994, critics were trying to get a ""fix"" on Besson, talking about ""Leon"" in terms of ""La Femme Nakita."" That put an entirely different spin of ""Leon."" But with subsequent movies, we can now re-position Besson's stuff, and understand his movies, including ""Leon,"" better.So, think of this: ""La Femme Nakita"" was Besson's whole thing applied to politics and spies. ""Leon"" is is Besson upon crime, love (especially the wholesome filial). ""Fifth Element"" is Besson on Sci-Fi, and ""The Messenger"" is Besson on culture, and native French pride (and not a very good movie, either).""Leon"" was good, especially with Reno and Portman. The New York City, and NYPD aspect was SO impossible and foreign to any conceivable reality, that it seemed to be taking place in Morocco, or Frankfurt, or Paris, or ANYWHERE but in the U.S. (for my foreign friends-- trust me, the police behavior is not even remotely akin to reality, thus was peculiar and odd, rather than exciting. Couldn't happen!) Note-- bad things CAN happen-- just the fantasies of Paris-born Besson were so far removed as to be silly. His far-reaching and ungrounded imaginations worked best in ""The Fifth Element,"" because as a sci-fi world, there IS no standard of expectation or other reality-tempering structure.Besson's all right. OK. Just know that all of his cinematic expressions sure seem to emerge from the same distinct, and fantasy-based, vision. That can be refreshing!",Léon - The Professional

127,dave13-1,Slick and entertaining.,8,15 April 2012,"A wonderful cast, especially Jean Reno and a 12-year-old Natalie Portman, highlights this high energy action thriller helmed by Luc Besson. The always interesting Gary Oldman plays a clever, dangerous and very bent cop who murders the family of a lowlife drug runner, unaware that a young daughter (Portman) has survived and sought the protection of a hit-man (Reno). The plot follows her pursuit of revenge against the cop, but the film centers on the unusual relationship that develops between the now- orphaned girl and the loner hit-man. This is the best aspect of the film: logical, carefully developed, sweet and dramatically powerful.The production is great-looking, slick yet effectively gritty and realistic and the action sequences are brilliantly staged. This was the first Luc Besson film I had ever seen and recognized that I was seeing a really big new talent. Highly recommended.",Léon - The Professional
128,rajdoctor,Leon,8,11 August 2007,"Number 40 in IMDb Top movies list! This is a love story about a 40 year old hit man Leon (Jean Reno) who gets involved by giving refuge to a 12 year old young girl Mathilda (Natalie Portman) whose family is killed by crazy drug cop Norman (Gary Oldman). Leon teaches Mathilda the job of an assassin, and takes revenge on the people who killed Mathilda's family.Even though the plot is simple the narrative is brilliant. It shows a tender relationship of 40 year old man with 12 year old girl. It sounds very corny! Is not it? But the execution of those tender scenes is handled with good apt. Some scenes and parts do go over the top and are less convincing but the growing up young girl's angle on love and the infatuation towards a fatherly figure is shown well.The story also unfolds not in the usual line of revenge drama, nor does it take you in the showing many characters and blood and gore of routine mafia films. There are calm and dramatic moments in the film. The camera work, music and direction are top class.Luc Besson as the director of this movie has done a fantastic job. The casting of Jean Reno  though looks a bit odd  I think is perfect. Jean delivers the role with that isolation psyche syndrome who finds it difficult to relate to a young girl, but still has feelings and emotions in him.The actions sequences are well drafted and shot. Some of them are brilliant  just for the big screen viewing.Towards the end of the movie, you want to see Leon and Mathilda meet again for the last time. Does it happen? For that you need to see the movie and decide.I will go for 7.75 stars out of 10 for this movie. Good one! (Stars 7.75 out of 10)",Léon - The Professional

133,johnnymonsarrat,"Jon Monsarrat review: perfect thriller, perfect drama",10,30 March 2002,"I can't say enough good things about ""The Professional"". It is a fast-paced action flick without melodrama, but it also has the heart and soul of a real drama, with interesting and original characters. The acting, directing, and storyline are all perfect.The film is not for young children because there is blood and gore, unfortunately, which is the only negative comment I'll make. Although the film is dark it is not one of those ""shocker dark films"" that are for me unbearable to watch, such as Pulp Fiction or Robocop, where the badguys are incredibly cruel live on stage.There is a satisfying ending that ties everything up nicely. It's arty without falling into the two traps of so many arty films: (a) arty in one aspect, awful in others (b) so subtle and obscure only an film major can comprehend it. It has something to say, and we get a glimpse of why young Natalie Portman became so successful.Who should see this film:-- Action movie lovers and likers, unless you've no tolerance for gore-- Drama and arty film types-- If you prefer more placid firms, but thought you might try a bite-your-nails thriller once in your life, watch this or ""Silence of the Lambs"", which is scarier but as good.I'll give this film a 10 out of 10.",Léon - The Professional

138,CinematicInceptions,Quietly impressive.,7,8 October 2015,"Two months after my first viewing, I'm still not quite sure what to think of this movie. I kind of wish I could watch it in the nineties so that I could really appreciate it, and this certainly isn't the only film I would do that for. Part of me says that I'm being under-appreciative of it, but at the same time I can't quite see why this is ranked as one of the top thirty movies of all time. Certainly it's an impressive work of cinema and a well-crafted story and an all- around solid movie, but I can't help but think that it's a little overrated. I guess I was just expecting there to be that one element of it that would make it so well rated like an iconic line, some incredible action sequences, unforgettable characters, an unbelievable twist ending, or that one scene that everyone talks about and that gets referenced in comedies over the next thirty years. But it doesn't really have any of that.Our story focuses primarily on the simple but incredibly skilled hit-man Leon and his neighbor/foster child Mathilda. Even though he has little charisma, he gives the audience a lot of reasons to root for him. He works by a code, drinks milk, is good with kids, lives on much less than he makes, and has some very impressive combative abilities. He's got an almost perfect profile for a movie hero: warm hearted but no less awesome as a result. Mathilda wins the audience over with her hardships, her desire for revenge, and her premature independence as an adolescent. I kind of expected Leon to be averse to teaching her to clean, thinking he would see it as unseemly for someone so young. But maybe he just decided that Mathilda would take revenge on Stansfield no matter what so she might as well be equipped to do it properly without hurting anyone else. I know there's the whole thing about the creepy romance between the Leon and Mathilda, but I saw it as more of a parental relationship than a romantic one. After all, Mathilda's real father didn't seem like he would be up for any parenting awards and it reflected on her. Leon's kindness to her gives her a chance to stop growing up and just enjoy being a kid for a change. So because of Mathilda's unfamiliarity with the feeling of being cared for she, and by extent we, easily misinterpret her feelings for Leon to be uncomfortably romantic.When the story isn't dealing with their relationship, it delves into the progression of Stansfield's investigation of Mathilda's family. At first he's just going for Mathilda's drug- dealing father, but later he goes after Mathilda unnecessarily when he realizes she's alive. Even though Stansfield doesn't have almost any interaction with Leon, he is basically the inverse of Leon. He kills for enjoyment rather than for a living and has no code about who he kills. Eventually, we learn that he is working with Leon's boss Tony, which isn't the greatest of unexpected turns, but it does make Stansfield more hateable. There's also a little subplot with Leon teaching Mathilda how to clean, and those scenes are some of the best in the movie.It's very well directed with the use of slow-mo and camera-tricks and such. The action sequences aren't anything very special in a stunt sense (though I am saying that twenty years out of context), but we can clearly see that Leon is one of the best of his kind and knows how to outsmart and outshoot his targets and their hired guns. The script isn't the greatest aside from the noteworthy execution of Mathilda's dialogue. This was probably helped by a solid performance from Natalie Portman, who plays her part impressively for her age and even for actors in general. Jean Reno also gives a solid though low-key performance of his mellow character. Gary Oldman is a little over-the-top with his character, which I guess means he had fun with the part but maybe he could have done with a little less eccentricity.If you like hit-man movies, just be warned that this has more emotion than it does action. It's not a huge imbalance, but the two jobs that we see Leon pull are pretty quick sequences that have little relevance to the rest of the film. That's not to say that there is a deprivation of action, just that it might not come in the way you're expecting. The external plot is action driven so you don't have to worry too much about how Stansfield is connected with Mathilda's father and Tony. If you don't like action movies, you might still enjoy this, but just know that it's not very representative of the hit-man genre even though it has many of the same elements. Overall Rating: 8.3/10.",Léon - The Professional
139,Ali_John_Catterall,Death is...whimsical today,9,19 November 2009,"The crime thriller birthed its own sub-genre in the 1940s, following the real-life discovery of a number of key Mob members during the Murder Inc trials. From Alain Delon in Le Samourai to Forest Whitaker in Ghost Dog: The Way of The Samurai, the shadowy hit-man has made regular appearances in crime flicks. However, not many assassins (or ""cleaners"") come in the shape of 12-year-old girls.As Mathilda and her eponymous mentor, Natalie Portman and Jean Reno give complex, sympathetic performances - at least when ranged against Gary Oldman's psycho cop.

When I first saw this film in a run-down motel room in Hollywood, Florida back in 1995, I never expected to be writing this review almost 25 years later. Come to think of it, there were many things that I wasn't expecting... like, I didn't expect young Natalie Portman would grow up to become Luke Skywalker's mom and Jackie Kennedy.'Leon The Professional' (1994) is the type of movie that you saw on HBO on a tiny television in the 1990's, and bought on DVD in the early 2000's, and then later you buy it on Blu-Ray and eventually you download it digitally - because it transcends media and time. As long as there are hitmen and aggressive young girls, then people will be watching this film. The themes of love and loneliness never get old or go out of style.The elements of a great film are all here - the pacing is perfect, acting is subtle and non-verbal at times when needed, cinematography is great, and there is a great antagonist (Gary Oldman). Among all of this perfection, there is also a truly unique love story. Finally, an action film that you can watch with your girlfriend or wife... if she's, like, super-cool and chill about weird and uncomfortable stuff.

Intelligent dialogues, strong emotional build-up, fast pace, absorbing atmosphere and a great soundtrack.But Leon would be doomed without first class actors.

Action is just the extra salt to the delicious cinematic plate Luc Besson is offering to us.Natalie Portman requires a special praise. This is not only a stunning performance from a 12 year old girl, this is even not only a great performance from an accomplished actress, it is absolutely Oscar material and, judging from her next projects, easily her best role to date.It is no coincidence that Luc Besson, Eric Serra and Jean Reno are French.

143,moviemanMA,"""You wanna be a cleaner? """,8,13 August 2005,"Movies about hit men are usually full of a lot of action, not intense and dazzling but just shoot em' up and pull the trigger. There is usually a dark history or a past that catches up with them. Thankfully there are movies that make hit men films fun to watch. Thankfully there is Leon.Leon (Jean Reno) is a professional hit-man in New York City. He is the best in town and in such a big city, there is a lot of work for him. The opening job is phenomenal and really sets the tone for the movie. Reno is very intimidating as the skilled assassin. But how a man who never thinks twice about killing a man could show some tenderness? Well all he needed was little Matilda played by a teenage munchkin named Natalie Portman After her family is murdered due to drug reasons, she must take refuge in Leon's apartment or else she will be found and killed as well. Although she hated her family and thought that she would one day do the same to them, she is distraught over the death over her four year old brother who was young and innocent like herself. Now she wants to know how to get redemption and ""justice"" for the slaying of her family.Her number one target is a man by the name of Stansfield (Gary Oldman), a man more vicious than Leon. He doesn't care who the barrel of his gun is pointed at just as long as it hits. With Matilda clinging to Leon day and night, he decides to give into her requests of becoming a ""cleaner"" like him. Along with Leon's favorite plant that he calls his best friend, the two learn much from each other. Now we have a Karate Kid interaction with Leon teaching her what seems to be useless things, but in the end they all pay off.Leon is a phenomenal film that takes us on a joy ride through New York City with the best hit-man and his young apprentice. Portman's film debut is a foreshadowing of her career to follow. Her stellar performance is very appropriate for the movie. Her character has had to be tough and smart her whole life and she really opens up to the audience. Reno's character is a complex one and he plays it very well. His foreign dialect and lack thereof charisma create a person that is both likable and mysterious. Oldman's menacing ways make him a despicable character and very powerful. Although he is a lot like Leon there is one difference: heart.Leon is an incredible experience and a great movie to watch anytime. It has action, drama, and comedy. It's not a big blockbuster action film or a depressing drama or a laugh out loud riot. Leon is a key piece to any movie lover's collection. This movie isn't for everyone.

144,Flagrant-Baronessa,My favourite hit-man movie,8,20 July 2006,"""Léon. What is it exactly that you do for a living?""""I'm a cleaner.""""You mean you're a hit-man."" So says the street-wise Natalie Portman as 12-year-old Mathilda and she is so breathtakingly astute and tough that it just breaks my heart. Léon tells the story of this young girl as she seeks the help of a professional hit-man named Léon (Jean Reno) to avenge her family after they are killed by a corrupt division of the FBI, lead by none other than Gary Oldman. Mathilda forms an unusual bond with Léon probably because they contrast and complement each other; Mathilda is mature and street-wise and Léon is almost childlike (he drinks milk and he can't read).Zooming in on the tough, gritty crime-infested streets of New York, Luc Besson adds his own street edge (probably from the streets of Paris, á la Nikita) to the film and this gives it a European feel and style. It blends this with some American elements like humour and gangster characters. Léon is a well-crafted and completely gripping thriller that above all features some truly memorable acting performances, in particular from Gary Oldman as cruel FBI-agent Stansfield.The relationship between the 12-year-old Mathilda and the middle-aged hit-man Léon feels inappropriate on more than one occasion. Like when he sees her talking to a teenage boy outside the restaurant and he storms out and tells her that she can't talk to just anyone (showing more emotion than at any other part in the film). Less than a minute later into the following scene, Mathilda is laying on his bed and says: ""Léon. I think I'm falling in love with you. It's the first time for me."" Creepy? Yes. Gripping? Yes.The whole film has a creepy but gripping tone, Gary Oldman bringing forth the creepiness in his character and the gripping part being the struggle of Mathilda. It has some flaws but overall an excellent film. 8/10",Léon - The Professional
145,lagudafuad,the ending of this movie is one to love,8,16 November 2012,"This is Natalie Portman's first feature film, her acting and professionalism showed she was a natural and you will not be able to tell. Leon the professional is an intense action/violence film that involves two souls that differ in age and view of life. It delivers an exciting screenplay, wonderful performance by both leads and the eventual climatic ending. Even though it seem mostly likely the movie will end the way it did, the way Luc Besson pulled it off was eventful enough for you to respect Leon (the hit man) as truly a professional.Luc Besson is the man behind the movies Taken (2008) and Taken 2 (2012), and this movie is an extension of a movie that he did in 1990 titled Nikita which also starred Jean Reno.Leon the professional was done in 1994 and directed by Luc Besson and it was met with favorable reviews, although disturbing as it may seeing a young child like Portman in such a situation as her character found herself.The movie plot is about a hit man named Leon (Jean Reno), who didn't know how to read or write but what he knew he knew well he was a killer and the best at it.Leon's path crossed with one little girl who lived in an apartment some rooms from his, he took a caring into her and tried to help her when he can. Her name is Matilda (Natalie Portman) who living with her father, brother, step mom and step sister.Matilda is always getting a regular biting from her father which made Leon take pity on her, she saw this pity as love and the little 12 year old decided to run an errand for Leon, when she gets back her whole family has been murdered and the killers were still about.Here is my favorite scene in the movie, when Matilda sees her family dead she walks past the men with the guns, didn't start screaming goes to Leon's door, her back turned to the gun men and pressed the bell, praying hard that Leon will just let her in, the moment Leon opened the door, his life changed forever.Another thing to look out for is Gary Oldman, his performance in this movie is worth talking about as it was one worth his pay.This tragic thriller, revolves around a love between two people not meant for each other, their involvement with each other brought death to the life of many.Leon is a nice film, something that you will enjoy, no pedophilia is in this movie mind you, so fear not and go see it.www.lagsreviews.com",Léon - The Professional
146,stevenrotherforth,A masterpiece of action cinema that transfers on to 4K superbly,10,22 August 2019,"Léon: The ProfessionalRevisiting Léon on 4K Blu-ray was a rather pleasant experience.
Luc Besson's film about a hitman who takes in a young girl after she witnesses her parents being brutally murdered is a masterpiece of action cinema.
Every scene oozes grit and paints a picture of a desperate world where life is hard and unforgiving.Jean Reno plays the titular character with a sense of innocence even though he is an expert killer.
Support from Gary Oldman is also a stand out.
He plays the villainous DEA agent named Stansfield with subtle menace.
Natalie Portman shines in her debut role as Matilda. The young girl who Léon takes under his wing.
The chemistry between her and Léon is marvellous and drives the heart of this fantastic movie.
The extended cut delves further into their questionable relationship and really adds to the story.
I recommend you first watch the theatrical cut and then see the extended version to truly appreciate its greatness.Cinematography is mesmerising. The opening scene as the camera pans through the city is wonderful as is Leon's introduction.
The direction by Besson is very impressive.
As is his engaging script.
The opening conversation is played out through the reflection in Leon's sunglasses and helps deliver the dialogue with sophistication and style.
Action is handled tightly with not a gunshot wasted.
Often brutal to behold but Besson still manages to make the carnage look artistic.'Léon' arrives on Ultra HD Blu-ray with a tremendous transfer.
This film is evidence of just how good 35mm film can look when given the 4K treatment.
There's still a noticeable amount of grain throughout which fluctuates in severity but it never becomes distracting.
The opening scene does nothing to wow in terms of image quality. It is only when Léon visits the convenience store for a carton of milk does the image really sharpen up.
We are then treated to fine textured detail of clothing.
Skin looks startling with wrinkles, pores and facial hair strikingly visible.
HDR is subtle. This isn't 'Aquaman' in terms of vibrancy but daylight scenes are splendid.
Yellow taxi cabs pop and shop signs are very colourful.
Black levels are finely detailed.
The rundown apartment building where Matilda and Léon live has fine nuances in paintwork and wooden textures.If this movie looks good, which it does. Putting many modern day releases to shame, then the sound quality is equally impressive.
The Dolby Atmos mix does a fine job steering ambiance around the room.
Each speaker offers a buffet of delicious aural information.
Height channels are used sparingly but effectively.
The shoot out in the hallway is a good demo.
The sprinkler system can be clearly heard overhead.
LFE has deadly impact when required.
Bullets wiz and hit there target with pleasing thud.
The climatic explosion fills the room with a deep chested gusto.
This is by no means a go to disc to show off your expensive Home theatre equipment but for a film of this age. The mix is highly commendable.So to sum up 'Léon' is a masterpiece of its genre.
A word often loosely used but here it is definitely so.
With a splendid 4K release this film has never looked or sounded better.",Léon - The Professional

148,emperor_bender,"Memorable, crazy movie",10,5 December 2008,"I hadn't heard much about this movie, so I really went out on a limb watching it. But sometimes it really pays off.First off, let me start by saying that in my opinion, this was one CRAZY movie. But I guess thats why I like it so much. Not a whole lot seemed to make perfect sense, but I guess thats what they were aiming for.The best performance by far was Jean Reno as Leon, the lonely professional hit-man, living in a run-down apartment down the hall from a dysfunctional family. Cast out in the family is Mathilda (Played by a young Natalie Portman), the 12 year old daughter who seems to be kicked around by everyone in the family except her little brother. While out shopping, Mathilda's family is killed by corrupt DEA agents, led by the completely insane Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman).Among many good performances was a unique plot, and many memorable scenes and lines. The music score really helps set the mood of each and every scene. Like I mentioned, I think this is a crazy movie so maybe thats why it stands out. You feel a bit of every emotion here as well.10/10.",Léon - The Professional
149,supertom-3,One of the greatest action films ever and so much more!,10,9 May 2002,"Luc Bessons greatest Hollywood film and perhaps the best action film ever. This is an action film with a heart. It has an engaging plot, interesting characters and relationships that develop and also where a lot of action films fall short, it has brilliant acting. The film is so thrilling. It is desperately tragic and also funny, its exciting and chilling. How a film can be so diverse and work well is beyond me. At times you'll be nearing tears in moments of tragedy and they will be seemlessly followed by moments of heart warming humour. The cast are all very good. Jean Reno is brilliant as the rather simple minded foreigner who at the start of the film cannot read but can kill as effectively as an A-bomb. Natalie Portman puts in one of the greatest child performances ever, the greatest in my opinion would be Haley Joel Osment in the Sixth Sense the film which should have earned him an oscar, and only his age perhaps denied him of that. Portman has rightfully been launched as a top actress since this film, including parts in the Star Wars saga which is the dream job of many an actor/actress and wannabe film star. Also in a scene stealing show is the versatile actor Gary Oldman, he is scary as the corrupt police officer with a drug problem, Oldman is so beleivable I'd almost be too scared to meet him if the chance were to arrise. This film is a definite classic. The action scenes are very good and the music is also great. You'll laugh, cry and be on the edge of your seat in this movie. The developent of the relationship between Leon and Matilda is engrossing, it never drifts into the realms of Lolita, it seems more like they see each other as family despite the fact Matilda is enfatuated with Leon. This film is a must see! 10/10",Léon - The Professional
150,Lebowskidoo,"Hypnotic and emotional, action packed and brutal, sweet and beautiful.",10,13 May 2018,"This movie caught me way off guard in theaters back in 1994, and it impressed me even more again on a rewatch. Luc Besson's greatest film, and this, from someone who was obsessed with The Big Blue and watched it way too many times.Gary Oldman, in what is probably his most evil and fascinating character, Natalie Portman slaying us all in her film debut and Jean Reno's best role ever. What more could you want?Hypnotic and emotional, action packed and brutal, sweet and beautiful.Éric Serra provides the score, and it reminds me so much of his score for Goldeneye, which I had not yet seen yet back when I first saw The Professional. He even wrote a song for The Professional end credits that got cut in favor of a Sting song, which wound up used in the Goldeneye end credits, ""The Experience of Love.""",Léon - The Professional
151,malkane316,Quick reviews!!,10,8 February 2005,"A strange film blending genres and emotions, made all the more strange because it is widely seen as one of the best films of the 90's. This is deserved as it brings together a talented cast and director with varied characters to a brilliant story about a hit-man who befriends a girl after her family is slaughtered by a local crooked cop. Jean Reno stars as Leon, in his best performance, the hit-man, 100%successful, professional, silent, but lonely. Gary Oldman is the crooked cop, stealing almost every scene he is in. Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, in easily one of the best child performances ever, conveying sadness and loneliness with hope and innocence, and anger and pain. The rest of the cast is also noteworthy.We are introduced to Leon, we see his mundane life, occasionally interspersed with acts of violence necessary for his career. His only friend is a pot plant, and his boss who fully respects him, exploits him to a certain degree because Leon is so quiet. He lives alone in a flat. A few doors down is Mathilda who lives with her abusive father, alcoholic mother, and innocent younger brother. They have seen each other occasionally in the corridor. Mathilda's father is in trouble with Oldman's character, and he is killed along with his wife and son when Mathilda is shopping. She arrives home to see what is still happening, knows she will be killed if she shows any emotion, so walks to Leon's door. Leon knows what has happened, and is torn between what to do. He cannot interfere, but eventually does the right thing. Soon the 2 become friends, and Mathilda wants to learn how to kill so she can get revenge. Oldman is looking for her though, and is not stupid.The film's direction is often beautiful, and it complements the story perfectly, meaning that the tear-jerking scenes, action scenes, and everything else are all the more potent. Although the action is brilliant, it is the scenes between Leon and Mathilda which make the film so good. We watch them grow together, learning off one an another, and they learn that life does not have to be spent on your own. There are many funny parts, most involving the fact that Leon has been outside of society most of his life. The training scenes are good, and it is more a story of love than anything else. Many critics mention a potential sexual relationship between the two, admittedly this may have happened in the future, but by the end the most important thing is that they have found a special person who can give them hope. The ambiguous and touching ending will pull at the heart, but we know that Mathilda can be strong now by herself. Although this is growing in fame it is still relatively unknown, but it is a startling film which everyone should see. 10 out of 10",Léon - The Professional
152,charchuk,Looks cheap and feels awkward,6,19 February 2008,"When it works, it really works. Reno is great, Portman is impressive, the two have great chemistry, and the action scenes are exhilarating. When it doesn't work, though, it really doesn't work. Oldman is basically playing the same role he was stuck with throughout the 90s (though he gives it his all), the direction is bland and damn near amateurish, the whole film looks cheap, and the core relationship, while developed well, leaves a bad taste in one's month. A little too much awkward sexual tension. I think the problem is that Portman's role was written for someone older, and, as such, she just seems too young. It's rather overrated, and it's also dated by some terrible, terrible music choices.",Léon - The Professional

Somebody serious!...???,7,3 June 2012,"A love story blinded by conscienceness but undeniably felt between the slow ""cleaner"" (Jean Reno) and the debut of his self appointed apprentice (Natalie Portman). She's spunky and in control while her hit man hero is slowly coming to terms with his professions' life's expectancy, his predicament and his emotions at the hands of a 12 year old drop out. Director Luc Besson still manages to drive the suspension of disbelief out the window along with Gary Oldman's over weirdness that is supposed to pass as tension producing terror. The popularity of the film got my attention, as does the opening 20 minutes. But it's the blossoming love story that keeps your interest. Besson will never be able to deliver a movie to be taken seriously due to his confusingly playful approach to film-making. Dialog too dramatic to be taken seriously, that never quite matches the film genre, other than comic book. Revenge, Love, Fate, Kapow!",Léon - The Professional

The movie begins with Leon, portrayed by Jean Reno, a hit-man who takes in a 12-year-old girl named Mathilda, portrayed by a young Natalie Portman in her feature film debut, whose family has been murdered by a corrupt DEA agent, portrayed by Gary Oldman. With the help of a friendly mobster, by Danny Aiello, and this weird 12-year-old girl, Leon will try his best to protect from this corruptive agent. ""Leon: The Professional"" is a mixture of action and heartwarming drama. This movie takes us on explosive action scenes, while warming our hearts with the friendly chemistry between Leon and Mathilda. Jean Reno delivers the best performance of his career as the milk-obsessed hit-man. Natalie Portman makes a pretty-well portrayal for her big-screen debut. Gary Oldman steals the show as the murderous and mischievous agent of corruption. Danny Aiello makes a sweet and tough impression in his character, as well.

159,tankace,Relationship between and older man and a girl been not creepy.,9,22 September 2016,"Léon is the best movie about the relationship of an older man with a girl and seen how much the Killing Joke did that so wrong and that this movie is an awesome neo-noir movie which as I mentioned to my Pulp Fiction review it brought this sub-genre back from the dead. So does it hold up with today's standard? Answer: Are you messing with me the flick rocks and here is why!The movie is a pulp or Hard Boiled film through and through. For disclaimer, Hard Boiled/Pulp movies are the crime stories in which a character faces an traumatic event and after that he or she tries to accomplish his or her goals. Also the story takes place in a urban environment, which has seen better days and as for the characters everything goes from corrupted cops to assassins with hearts of gold and anything in between. Just to make it crystal clean this stories are also detective stories but where the stories of Poirot, Sherlock Holmes etc take place in the aristocratic cycles of society , the Hard Boiled ones are more everyday stories , some examples of those stories are Dirty Harry, Sin City,Pulp Fiction and Leon.To our main story ,after the murder of her family twelve year old Matilda(Natalie Portman) is taken under the wind of the professional assassin Leon (Jean Reno) and form an unusual friendship in which Matilda learn the trick of the job. Apart of the amazing performance of Portman, Oldman(from corrupt cop to Comissioner Gordon, wow what a change) and of course Reno the film rocks because it is character-based and not action-based and it deserves the cult status it has.When a crime movie,comic or TV series is based of its cast then though it is harder to make a good action scene, it packs more for you had become invested to the character and you care who lives or dies. Just think that in the first Taken, how much you were nervous about Liam Neeson's character when he tried to find where is his daughter and how bored you were by the Taken 2 and 3 in which the story exist only for Neeson to kill some and not watch his character evolve over time. In the end Leon is a must watch for every person who loves a good crime story and as cult classics go this is one of the best in the area.

But overall the film is very effective, and effective in all aspects. Starting with the cinematography: an oppressive look in the interior scenes _ houses with tight halls and grimy walls_ and a cold, desolated one in the exterior scenes _with a mostly gray palette of colors, streets with big corners and dead ends. This odd, dark ambient, added to a lovely romantic soundtrack, gives this film a distinct, perfect atmosphere. *About the story:* ""There is poetry in the dialogs, and there is definitely some artistry put in this film. Is very similar to TDK in that aspect. Very good character development, something extremely rare in this sort of film. A few things felt forced here and there, but overall, a good and moving story about a kid growing up all by herself in a totally hostile environment."" *And to finish, the acting:* ""Great performances by Oldman, Reno and Portman.

161,zeekwunlau,The mutual salvation of two souls,9,20 April 2020,"Loneliness is often the life state of one person, love is the fireworks that two people collide. When loneliness meets love, then his future is destined to be extraordinary. The film tells us the wonderful love story between the lonely killing anion and the little girl Matida, to write a wonderful drama for us to break the lonely ice with love.The power of love is extremely powerful. Long-term loneliness makes people alert, wraps themselves in a sleeve, does not dare to communicate with people, holds a high degree of vigilance for anything, and leads a lonely life for a long time, which is also important for Lyon to become a cruel killer The reason, when Lyon met Matida, for a long time, she had a guard against her to protect himself. He used cold appearance to reject Matida 's good intentions, and the director also used multiple faces. Close-up to show Lyon's inner fluctuations. Deep inside Lyon is actually full of love. Matida, who also lost her younger brother, could feel this love. She used her bold expression to break the high wall in Lyon's heart. When Lyon decided to take Matida, a long-range lens in the film was presented to the audience with far-reaching significance. The film did not directly express it in lines, but used this lens to illustrate that Lyon accepted her, a tall and strong man and a weak can not help but wind The little girl walked out of the street, this picture looks very uncoordinated, but it actually shows the beginning of the lonely killer encountering love.The film tells a story on the surface: a killer helps the little girl at the next door to get revenge. In fact, it tells the story of two people redeeming each other.Why do you say that? Lyon is a killer, and his life is calm but full of danger: ""Cleaning up"" will be fatal if he is careless. He has never slept with a peace of mind. There is no family member but Tony who is the boss to communicate with him. But the name of the film tells us that the killer is not too cold. Although the protagonist is cold-blooded and monotonous in life, he has a pure land deep in his heart. He also yearns for and loves beautiful things. From the potted flowers he raised, the infatuated expression when watching movies in the cinema, it can be seen that he is cold-blooded, tired of the world and immersed in some good, sincere and pure, these actions do not require him to communicate with other people, so with His killer character is not against. But in any case, he could not go further and pursue those good things, and he himself has become accustomed to it. At the beginning, I thought that the relationship with the little girl was just to show his friendliness, not really want to establish a relationship with the girl or others.Needless to say, the little girl's problem is that she smokes, skips class, lacks parental care, and is a problem teenager. The little girl also needs to change, but the change happened passively at the beginning, and caused her to lose her favorite brother. The girl is eager for revenge, but how does revenge and her life go? There is no answer.What is appealing about the film?Created a combination that is unexpected and continues to promote the development of the plot. The killer and the girl seem to come together at the two extremes. This is not a rigid combination, nor is it necessary to take each one, but they all need to heal each other's inner scars. In the evolution and enhancement of this demand, we even expect this unusual emotional relationship to be at a loss.The purpose of the little girl is very clear, that is revenge, and she can only achieve it by establishing a relationship with Lyon. Getting along for a long time quickly brought the relationship between them closer, and the girl even realized the warmth and happy time that she never had in her home. The uncle originally wanted to save the girl, didn't want to live with her, and didn't want to avenge her, but the girl's strength forced him to make concessions. She couldn't lose her anymore.The behavior of most girls has always pushed their relationship closer. As the plot further developed, the two began to gradually approach the original purpose of the combination, which made them tighter and gradually threatened them. Your own safety. At the last moment of the crisis, between life and death, Lyon saved the girl, and he embarked on a better road to salvation. After cutting out the passage of life, Lyon let the girl go down alone, the girl did not listen to life and death, Lyon must convince her to go down willingly, thought that the unspoken uncle would only say ""believe me"", ""I will go out alive and there will be nothing wrong"" With such guarantees, at this juncture of life and death, if you don't speak your heart, you may have no chance. So Lyon finally spoke the warm monologue. The little girl asked Lyon to regain her longing for life and longing for a good relationship. Even if this kind of beauty was not finally obtained, I think Lyon must be at ease when he finally died with the bad guys.After losing Lyon, the little girl can only go to Tony, and the latter allows the girl to return to school. In the end, the girl should return to normal campus life. This is the best ending for the little girl. Compared with the spiritual salvation of Lyon, the salvation of the little girl is the salvation of life. During the revenge stage, the relationship between the two people has matured her a lot, and she has achieved revenge and found the root, and it is equally important that I start her real life. She no longer broke the jars of life like before, she chose to plant Lyon pots to commemorate Lyon, but also regarded it as the beginning of serious life. Holding him. The same is planted with hope and goodness, let them grow up with the girl.",Léon - The Professional
162,Dockelektro,This movie changed my life,10,17 June 2001,"I have written a comment to almost every movie of Luc Besson, and every time I confronted myself with the opportunity of writing a comment to this one... I didn't have the courage. Because, from all I have to say about this movie, I don't know where to start. My encounter with this movie was, like many love stories, occasional. It aired in the public television one night, and I had anything better to do. It grabbed me and never stopped amazing me until now. Here started my interest in Luc Besson's career and work, and in Eric Serra's music. Today, after having seen it for maybe the 20th time, I am still an unconditional fan of the sheer experience that this movie is.Maybe the most universally acclaimed movie from Luc Besson, its premiere was surrounded with scepticism: the last movie of the director was almost 4 years ago, and it was an underwater documentary many people dismissed. Even so, people still remembered the hit that was La Femme Nikita (1990), and how it made the hearts beat. So, they decided to try this one. The success was out of this world, putting it right next to all his other movies all of fame, and making it his third most watched movie (remember this was before the Taxi movies and The Fifth Element). All I can say is that this success was not casual.Léon is by far Luc Besson's finest crafted movie. The means were not too big (which could make the artistic movie to slip) and the actors were not celebrities (which could link their faces to a certain established image). The result was a freedom of speech which let Besson film it the way he wanted to, using wild camera angles, lenses and editing. All this gave the movie a totally new look, which separated it from all the other action movies. But the way of filming it wasn't the only novelty and distinctiveness here.This a movie about love. This is a movie about an impossible world and the possible relationships in it. This is a movie about injustice, and the way things have to evolve. And above all, this is a movie about two characters who find that there is something more about the world than just death and violence. Léon, under his rigid appearance, has a heart of gold. Mathilda, under her minor age, is a force of nature. And this will give Léon ""a taste for life"", and making him think that maybe there is more to it than just living like a hitman. Their fates will be unpredictable. Only them, with only their will to help them, can make it. This movie is thoroughly human, and gives us a new point of view of the concept of people on screen. Luc Besson's camera angles and shots (all those close-ups on Mathilda's face) have the power to reveal the true characters and their weaknesses. ""Léon"" has a special strength in stablishing a new way to reveal the depth of characters, and, like I said, no movie I saw made this again.The casting of this movie is out of this world. Léon, played by Jean Reno, is the perfect choice: cool and straight but sensible and deep, he is the depiction of innocence, of the people who do what they have to, even if they don't want to do it. Mathilda, played by the overwhelming revelation of Natalie Portman, is a standout in all the other child roles in the history of movies. She takes the screen with a flash, and grabs the viewer. Pure spectacle, in a 12-year-old form. Gary Oldman, in the role of Norman Stansfield, gives ""evil"" a new meaning, as he depicts someone who manages to be on all edges: mental, moral, and physical. Even though these characters are never on screen at the same time, and meet separately only one, they form a triangle which makes us think by all the three. And the perfomance is incredible, altogether.Although this one was filmed in New York, using some American actors, I never seen such a European look to an American film. And the thing that struck me the most was that in the DVD the film is dubbed in French, and the voice-overs are perfect, making the film perfectly watchable. Fact is, let's be straight, no American director could make this movie like this. We have camera angles that strike us in the face. We have wide lenses that take us to another world. And we have a form of editing like anything the world has ever seen. This gives a look like no other American movies do. That's what I like about it: this movie is European, and breathes a style only the European originality has. This makes me proud.It is very clear that this movie marked my life. When I filled the papers to enroll myself at film school, I put this movie as one of the movies that influenced me. And this wasn't casual. This is one of my favorite movies of all time, no questions asked, and it is sitting on the top of my list of Besson, right next to ""The Big Blue"", and ""The Fifth Element"". I could write much more about it, but I'm afraid the limit is 1000 words, and I don't want to have my speech cut off.If you haven't seen this movie, see it now, it is absolutely unmissable, and one of the best movies of the decade.",Léon - The Professional

165,bwaynef,"A violent, sexy version of a Shirley Temple movie",7,29 March 1999,"Even though Gary Oldman's portrayal of a pill popping, homicidal Drug Enforcement Agent followed his title role in ""Bram Stoker's Dracula"" by two years, the fine British actor doesn't appear to have gotten the Count from Transylvania out of his system.  While biting down on the capsules he pops into his mouth prior to executing his victims, Oldman shivers, shakes, crosses his eyes, and shrieks in ways similar to a vampire preparing to sink his fangs into a jugular vein.  It's an entertaining comic book performance that is perfectly in synch with a story that, no matter how grim and violent, is essentially a fantasy, one as syrupy and sentimental as an old Shirley Temple movie.",Léon - The Professional
166,OldAle1,"stupid, glossy trash is a low point in the careers of all involved",3,22 April 2008,"Well well. Luc Besson takes on John Cassavetes for the first time in this pastiche (for the first half, anyway) of Gloria. Jean Reno is an illiterate Italian (? it's not totally clear, but this is how he's referred to) hit-man in his 40s in New York, a simpleton with no friends other than his plant, an assassin of inordinate skill (though we see no real evidence of this until the very end of the film) who takes in an orphaned Natalie Portman, a pre-teen when this was filmed but dressing like a hooker through most of the film, eventually agreeing to teach her the assassin's art so she can revenge herself upon the killer of her horrible family, Gary Oldman as an insane, dirty-cop drug-addict DEA officer. Got it? Yeah, I got it, it wasn't hard to figure out....though none of it made any sense, ever. There are a few reviews of this film that have suggested that it be looked at as existing in sort of a fantasy world, and that would seem to be a better way of looking at it. Not much makes sense if looked at in real-world terms, even less sense than in usual in a violent action movie; but the film doesn't seem to have any internal logic. Reno is the hit-man to end all hit men despite being an illiterate simpleton? Oldman is some fairly high-level cop despite being so obviously, categorically insane? There never seem to be any extras around in most of the indoor scenes; there's a whole 5-minute scene in a washroom between Oldman and Portman and nobody intrudes. None of this works in a film that ostensibly takes place in a real New York City Let's talk about the acting. Though I didn't think Reno's character made any sense, I rather liked him, I got taken in by his charm; Oldman on the other hand played a complete cartoon character. Did he play him well? Perhaps. I don't know. Was he supposed to be a cartoon? Did Besson think this was a cool idea? I guess so. It didn't work for me, at all. It was awful. And Portman; I'm not going to necessarily argue that her performance was bad, I'll give a 12-year-old the benefit of the doubt when playing a character that has to alternate between cutesy, slutty, and determined; but again, I didn't buy the person she was supposed to be. And although at the end the film never....quite....indulges in the pedophilic fantasies that it seems to be heading towards, it still comes to close for comfort. Portman wears skimpy outfits throughout, and the camera pays more attention to her ass than is probably necessary. Were this my first Luc Besson film, I might have given him a bit of a pass, but given his usual predilection for waifish, very young model types...ewww.The ending is sentimental, trite, and completely unbelievable. It's an extension of the film as a whole, which probably doesn't even deserve the 3/10 I'll give it.",Léon - The Professional
167,PipAndSqueak,Nothing to lose,9,5 April 2018,"Casting for this film is spot on, starting with Jean Reno as the ruthless contract killer, through incredibly young Portman as the orphaned girl, to Oldman as the psychopathic and evil cop. The hitman cares only for his killing skill, a potted plant (a prayer plant, I think) and the dreamy and imaginative routines in film musicals. The girl is lost, or a lost cause, both in her own eyes and those of her abusive family. Only her little brother 'loves her' and he is taken from her in the most brutal of fashions. The hitman can't help observing the whole nasty episode but is too knowing to involve himself, except, the girl has already tugged his heart-strings.

169,Cedric_Catsuits,One of the top 10 movies ever,10,24 April 2006,"This might equally well have been entitled 'Mathilda' for there is no question it is Natalie Portman who steals the show from the merely brilliant Jean Reno (who should have got an Oscar for this.) Gary Oldman is as good being bad as ever, and Danny Aiello provides a classy supporting role.The movie could be controversial in many respects but the sheer class and emotion lift it above any doubt. It reflects real life. Perhaps surprisingly, it is in Leon that emotion surfaces more easily, with Mathilda almost carrying the hardened hit-man as well as the film, through a series of punishing tests.Mathilda is irresistible, cute, practical, tortured, sensual, and yet remains entirely innocent. As is the heartless, simple, cold-blooded murderer, Leon. This is artistic, entertaining, depressing, uplifting, shocking, yet always remains beautiful and true. It is sad that Portman has never come anywhere near to repeating her performance in Leon, and probably never will. Whatever reasons she may have, it is sad for the fans that she doesn't take on more of these 'gritty' roles. But it's one more reason to watch, be amazed and captivated by Leon.",Léon - The Professional
170,illbebackreviews,"Leon is another amazing movie that adds to one of cinemas greatest years, 1994!",7,28 January 2013,"To me, no year in cinema history is as important as the year 1994. It is the year that created cinematic masterpieces, Pulp Fiction, Shawshank Redemption, Forrest Gump, the great Lion King and another masterpiece, that some may forget, Leon: The Professional. This alone makes the movie a must see Leon the Professional is a masterpiece Crime Drama movie about a hit-man named Leon and a young girl, who after the loss of her half family, seeks revenge on the people responsible for their murders by training alongside Leon. This movie has a plot that is extremely simplistic and just very easy to follow. The movie is also absolutely amazing in pretty much every way.The acting in the movie is superb. Young Natalie Portman really shows exactly how good an actress she could be at the age of 13. Since I haven't seen Black Swan, this, to me is her finest performance. Jean Reno as Leon was absolutely wonderful as the two shared some great scenes but the star of the movie, to me, without any doubt is Gary Oldman. There is no need to go on about him as an actor in general but in this movie, he is something absolutely unbelievable. He does that Heath Ledger's Joker type performance and is absolutely amazing as Stanfield, the one who murdered Mathilda's parents.The story itself is incredibly movie. By now, its a story that's being done to death with a bad guy falling in love with kids and growing a heart but no movie has ever nailed the idea like Leon. Seriously, the 2010 Despicable Me is the exact same story and is done horribly when compared to this. Leon is far more detailed. I mean, its not like Leon saw Mathilda and just loved her straight away. No! He tried to kill her during her sleep. He gets annoyed at her, he plays with her and he does everything. The way the relationship was executed was phenomenal.The characters in the movie are just absolutely wonderful and are extremely detailed. Mathilda is probably the finest child character I've ever seen, as Empire Online have said themselves. I could NOT agree more! There is just so much depth to her and not just she lost her brother and wants revenge. You understand her as a character for some strange reason and everything feels real. Leon is just an exceptionally cool character who keeps reminding me to the Terminator. The way his life turns on its head after meeting Mathilda is fantastic. However, my favorite character of the film is the one they didn't give enough screen time, which is a pity, and that is Stanfield. Seriously, he was such a great character in the movie. When Mathilda stated that the only one whom she loved in her family was her younger brother, we get a bit of an idea as to why but I honestly wish, that it was shown more so we could perhaps care for Mathilda EVEN MORE! The cinematography is great in the movie, the soundtrack is well composed and the editing is very nice.As part of my IMDb Top 250 quest, I'm glad I actually saw this movie as its pretty much a flawless classical 90's movie. 5 Words to describe this movie would be: Classical 90's Masterpiece, Great entertainment! To conclude it here, this movie is certainly one of the very best movies of the 1990's and when it comes to the great movies of 1994, it sits alongside the three masterpieces of '94. Please watch this movie as I'm sure you will be emotionally involved in this movie and have an absolute great time with the film. Its a great example of '90's movie magic.",Léon - The Professional
171,tnrcooper,"If you don't like this, we can't be friends.",10,6 December 2013,"Somehow I missed this incredible film when it came out. I was in college and studying pretty hard. Anyway....better late than never. This is a film that conveys how amazing humans are - from sadistic maniacs to tender hit men. The complexity of the behaviors, the abilities of the characters to make largely believable choices based on their moral codes, and some astonishing performances from some incredible actors make this a film you must like if we're ever going to see each other again.The principals give us some incredible performances. Jean Reno as Leon is astonishing. His ability to convey a million feelings with a blink of his eyes, a stiffening of his shoulders, or even the intake of breath make him someone I could watch in anything. I loved loved loved him in Ronin and this has only increased my love of the guy. I'm not gay but if I watch Leon enough, I might soon be! I will have to check out more of his work. His modesty, loyalty, decency, complexity, his tenderness and firmness with Mathilda (Natalie Portman), his steadfastness, and his courage make him one of my favorite movie characters in any film. I thought I wouldn't need to use any more superlatives for Natalie Portman having watched Heat about 50 times but she was younger in this film and she gives a performance with even more range than she showed in Heat. I'm happy to be able to see her work (even though I thought Black Swan was pretentious, predictable, melodramatic pablum). Her ability to convey anger, fearfulness, tenderness, confidence (I loved her peremptory dismissal of the four boys trying to protect their claim to neighborhood turf), and burgeoning sexuality (fortunately this part of the film doesn't quite take the film off course though I was worried for a second) while most definitely being a kid (she loves cartoons!!!) is amazing. Having said that, the best thing about Mathilda is her resilience. She is a survivor and this trait is Mathilda's baseline characteristic. Portman is just an incredibly gifted actress and her performance here is almost enough to leave me speechless.Danny Aiello is fantastic as Leon's loyal friend. He is a rock for Leon and asks no questions. He can always be trusted. Aiello conveys the sense of a man who cannot be shaken and is a true friend. He's probably heard it all and yet he's still there for his friend. Honestly, I thought Oldman was a bit over the top in his role. Obviously he is supposed to be out of control but I thought this was self-parodic, even for him. Luc Besson is never better at the helm and as a writer. His steady hand is much in evidence in keeping such a wild plot on pace and finding the emotional and moral centers of the film. The script is fantastic - a hit-man with a heart of gold, a precocious tweener, and a psychotic, crooked cop. Really, if you don't like this film, we can't be friends.",Léon - The Professional

The South Korean film Parasite is a good example of ""bad, so I will make it extra bad."" Leon, the movie we are discussing now, also falls into that category. I am not being unjust folks. It's a crappily written film with a very very ridiculous premise. I'm occasionally ok with a ridiculous premise, but at other times I am annoyed by them. Leon is an annoying premise. How can I explain to you how annoying? I really am not sure how. All I can say is that the ending is worst then everything that goes before it. Oh and by the way, I have seen Oldham in about half a dozen films and he becomes more and more unimpressive. His over the top, super animated antics in this film, don't convince me of greatness.

I love you so I choose to protect you silently. Protection is my way of loving you. This is Lyon'a love for Mathil. The love of fish for birds cannot be shelved. Only choose this way to love. Love is forgiving, love is hurt.
A killer should not be too kind, and should not care about a person. Lyon is not a good killer.
It is often wondering why Lyon had to carry that pot of green dill is no matter where he went, and why in the last crisis moment he still instructed Mathil to take care of Actress liu yifei's choice is too good!! I love it!! So happy!! Pot of plants. What's so strange about a pot of plants. Lulu is the best evidence that Lyon is not a good killer. Lulu represents the weak, the people who need protection and care, and the love that Lyon could not protect. In fact Lyon really wants to love someone, protect her, take care of her, pamper her. If the person does not show up, then he has to fill this void with a pot of green dill. Mathil was like a pot of vigorous green dill filling his broken heart. The revolving staircase, brown and black, reveals a simple and dignified atmosphere. Step by step up the stairs, spinning, spinning, lost with the rotation of the stairs, at the end of the rotation, a fairy-like girl is waiting quietly. Smoking cigarettes unruly and pretending to be mature. At first it was often inadvertent. Knowing that in your own identity, it's best not to provoke the evil police who are not as good as crazy dogs. However, in the fact of Mathil's pleading, his cold heart began to melt. The door opened and Lyon greeted Mathilda, giving her a safe haven and also giving her lonely heart a chance to redeem.
As a result, this elf-life mature and childish girl stubbornly stuck in Lyon's life and would never leave again. She stubbornly asked him to help his brother revenge, stubbornly asked him to teach her to "" clean up"" stubbornly asked him to love her, care about her, stubbornly transformed his life. Reason told Lyon that the killer must not have feelings. He must kill her.
However his heart had been shaken. His life is no longer just about killing people and that pot of green dill. He really loves her, he can break into the police station for her alone, and deal with Agent Hundred for her alone. He didn't forget to avenge Mathilda until he died, burying himself in a royal.
His love is so deep. A teenage elf-like girl, an indifferent man in his 30s or 40s; an angle who can hear the call of the Lord at any time, a bloody demon with hands in his hands... No matter what, it is an insurmountable gap. He can only hide this love that cannot be put aside in his heart. The surface kept refusing her. It was not until the last moment that she dared to say to her; "" Mathilda , I love you"" Only at this time, this sentence may become a ticket to send little Mathilda to return to the world, instead of biting her life. Fuse. In this world, is there such a person who can open a door or you a safe haven.

179,Sonatine97,The Director's Cut is even better than the classy original!,8,24 June 2000,"The original Leon was truly excellent - typical of most Besson films, full of style, drama, dry wit & European subtlties.The main story is quite ordinary really. Three principle characters - Leon (Reno) is the cleaner, or hitman. Very good, very professional, very deadly. And yet he has become more and more detached from the real world - all he knows is a world of killing, exercise and shady deals.Matilda (Portman) lives with her brutish stepfather and his family. She has no true family except for her 4 year old brother. Other than that she goes through her daily 12 year old existence by being bullied & slapped around.Stansfield (Oldman), a police detective who now believes the grass is very much greener on the other side, and has become a drug dealer while still holding down his cop side.One day Matilda returns from a shopping trip to find her horrid step family gunned down my Oldman and his crew. She's shocked but remains indifferent to the killings, until she finds out they've also shot her true brother.She has no where to go and Stansfield still hasn't finished with his killing spree realising from a family photo that only Matilda remains alive.All this is watched through the spyhole of Leon's front door. He too is startled but like Matilda remains indifferent.She walks down the corridor and rings his doorbell, anguish desperately written all over her face for him to let her in. The question is, will he?And this is where the story really gets interesting. Yes we can see its going to be a movie about revenge & justice, but the two characters are like Romeo & Juliet, star crossed lovers, although very much in a missing father-daughter sense.The story moves on at a steady pace, Matilda & Leon teaching each other their respective skills. He shows her how to kill with a rifle; she shows him how to read & write.The ending is quite explosive, literally, but also very sad & moving. Just when you think the two have truly found each other it goes horribly wrong.The original film is, as I say, very good, but is also naggingly incomplete. There are too many loose ends in the mid section and we're never really sure how the relationship between Leon & Matilda develops so quickly.However, its only now, some 6 years on do we find the answer to our mystery. Besson has released a Director's Cut, which adds about 30 minutes of character development missing from the middle of the first. Only trouble is, the DC version is only currently available in France & Japan.But such was my desire I went over to Paris and saw it at a full moviehouse. And what a difference. The mid section offers true evidence of Matilda's revenge tutored by the fatherly Leon, but there's also a slightly darker area, which may explain why it wasn't kept in the original version.Even in the original there are subtle hints of something more than just a father/daughter relationship going on between the two, but this is investigated much further in the DC when you have this worrying thought as to how far Besson is willing to push Portman.Happily nothing comes of it, but the extra minutes do add a few more answers to an otherwise excellent movie. Reno is, as always a joy to watch, and seems to have reprised his role from the earlier Besson Movie Le Femme Nikita.Oldman is perhaps a slight weak link, playing his role far too over the top to be taken seriously, which is a great shame, because he was quite excellent in Besson's later film, The 5th Element.But the true honours have to go to Portman, her first leading role for a girl of only 12, I'm still amazed how she wasn't nominated for an Oscar. Even more so with how she hasn't really been allowed to develope her considerable talent in latter films, including Star Wars 1, and Heat.If you want an example of her divine acting talent look for the scene near the start. Ringing Leon's doorbell and the tearful expression on her face as she silently begs to be let in while a hitman looks on!I sincerely hope Leon DC becomes more widely available. For me its Besson's best film and well worth owning.*****/*****",Léon - The Professional
180,brianberta,A great action film with characters which I greatly cared for,8,31 January 2016,"While many action movies tend to suffer from being style over substance, this movie provides just enough depth to make us care for the two main characters in this movie. Also, the plot has a few other changes added to it which makes it seem more interesting and original than many other action films of the genre.After a young girl's family is murdered, she meets a hit man who takes her in and the two bond over their time together as they develop an odd friendship with each other.One thing good about it is that it doesn't consist entirely of non-stop repetitive action scenes. Large portions of the film are focused on establishing the chemistry and bonding of the 2 leads: Leon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman). At the beginning of the movie, Mathilda's whole family is murdered. Though she didn't like most of her family, the death of her 4-year old brother has a negative impact on her as he was the only one in her family who she cared about. Her bonding with Leon is an interesting plot point as he was one of the only people who she really cared about. The time they spend together made me grow an attachment to them.Because of this slightly risky choice, however, some people argued that Leon was a pedophile and Mathilda's character was too overly-sexualized. To some extent, I could see why someone would think that, but there are reasons for this. Mathilda came from a broken home where she had a burning hatred towards most of her family members. Leon was one of the only people that she cared for. Also, since she was 12, she was probably just starting to go through puberty and was just starting to discover her sexual feelings towards others. She even admitted to Leon that she was (or thought she was) falling in love with him. Despite her efforts to flirt with him, Leon thankfully refused her attempts and he chose to love her more as a father than to actually share a romance with her. I don't agree with these arguments that much and I think that the movie handled that plot point in the most appropriate way it could.Also, the acting is really great in this film. Most people usually mention how Natalie Portman gave a fantastic performance and I agree with that. It's hard to find a really good child actor in most films, but she was exceptional in her role. Even though I felt like she was a little annoying at times, those few scenes did not break all of the other scenes she was in where she was able to show different emotions very convincingly. She was able to go from a frightened young child to someone capable of killing so convincingly, it makes her relationship with Leon more realistic and plausible.Jean Reno gave an intense and solid performance too. None of his lines were ever cringeworthy and his face conveys a great myriad of numerous emotions and great sensitivity which in a way, made the action scenes slightly better. He did a good job in the movie, but I don't think that enough credit is going to Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman as Stansfield gave an exceptional role as the villain. He is able to look threatening just at the sight of him. Every time he's on screen, you feel a sense of uneasiness and a sense that something bad is about to happen. In one of the scenes when he confronts Mathilda in the bathroom, that scene is very tense not just because of the most obvious reason, but because his performance gives the scene quite an unnerving feel to it. All 3 of them expertly carried the movie and I can't think of any other actors or actresses who would better fit their roles.Unfortunately, however, like many other action movies I've seen, I felt that one viewing was enough for me. At its core, it is a pretty genuine action movie and I felt like it didn't provide enough that made me want to revisit it for future viewings since I was already aware of what happened in it. My reason for this has a lot to do with the fact that I wasn't too engaged by its action scenes. ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" has extremely absorbing action so I wanted to revisit that one after I watched it, but I can't say the same about this one. Is this point subjective? Yes, but I can't help the fact that I feel this way.In conclusion, this was a very great movie. I do feel like one viewing is enough for me, but that's not to say that it's a bad movie by any means. It contains original and interesting plot points, characters which I cared for, and outstanding acting performances for the 3 main leads. It is a great movie, and I'm glad that I checked it out. I can understand why so many people like this film.",Léon - The Professional

It appeared to me like another action film about hit-man. I many times heard other people talking how great this film is and I couldn't understand how this movie is different from others. Now after few years I've watched it again, and now I realised it. Back then I was into action movies, so I've watched movies only to see some action, I didn't care much about a plot. This movie has some impressive action sequences, which were so beautifully filmed, that every minute of it was very enjoyable. But action isn't the most important thing about this film. What's important is an original story about unusual relationships between contract killer and a teenage girl. What else is good about this film is the colorfulness of it. Jean Reno was typical Jean Reno and that's good, he made a pretty original hit-man. Even more I liked Gary Oldman's performance, he always plays bad guys in movies so well, I think the movie would be much worse, if Stansfield was played by other guy.",Léon - The Professional

At running just over 2 hours, Leon tells the story of a 12 year-old orphan girl who is taken in by a ruthless assassin who -at her request - trains her in the art of the hit man. At the heart of this masterpiece lies substance and ferocity that is done in such style and flair you would be blown away.Beeson, who, previously had directed such films as Nikita and The Big Blue has simply crafted a film that no other director in Hollywood could have crafted. The music, acting, direction and story all pay off brilliantly and shed a light that hadn't been seen before. Take for example the acting, genuinely moving and emotionally charged. Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman all excel with dynamic and star powered performances. Gary Oldman is as brilliant as ever before making Stansfeild a corrupt and violent character one wouldn't want to cross. As for Reno's and Portman's performances they remain unchallenged.Beeson delights when coming to the big action sequences. Fast, brutal and stylish in approach are the Beeson payoffs. The music plays like a self taught orchestra, scene after scene has a meandering and thoughtful score.Verdict:Leon is full of memorable scenes and characters.

It still captures my attention and I sit rapt, awaiting every familiar bit, and the inevitable new things I will see. Jean Reno is GRReat, as is Gary Oldman and and Tony Aiello. But it is Natalie Portman who shines so brightly as to make one feel almost guilty in becoming so attached, if only cinematically, to a 12-year old girl. She exudes vulnerability, toughness, and yes, sexuality in ample measures.It occurs to me after looking at the current bland and boring Hollywood fare of remakes and sequels, that now is the time to pick up Mathilda's life in a sequel (let's call it ""Mathilda""). Now a young woman, out of school and perhaps in her own 'cleaning' business! I'd sure like to see her deal with Old Tony. Luc Besson must direct.Ah, but this makes too much sense. Hollywood would never go for it!!!",Léon - The Professional

185,saytosandeep,"MY REVIEW: Intelligent, Emotional and Intense!!",8,13 July 2014,"Leon. A professional assassin rescues a young girl whose family were killed in a police raid conducted by a corrupt police officer. Girl teams up with the assassin to take the revenge. Now, the assassin here is 50+ played by famous Spanish actor Jean Reno, the girl is in her teens played by Oscar winner Natalie Portman and police officer is Gary Oldman who always enjoys himself so much when it comes to negative roles.Leon's strength lies in the unusual cracking chemistry between Jean and Natalie. Natalie wears her role so well that it's very difficult to take your eyes off. The scenes of Jean training Natalie the skills of being an assassin are laced with witty humor. The neat, uncluttered and linear screenplay helps movie's emotional strength so that you can absorb the feeling of the characters to the fullest. Gary Oldman gets lesser screen time than expected but does an astounding job as heartless corrupt police officer. Only false note that seems to be here is not showing is how Gary manages to run his evil business and gets full military support in the climax to take down one man and a girl. Action scenes are very well done and do not try to over shadow the emotional and intense undercurrent that flows in the story throughout.I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Leon: The Professional. Watch it for its apt cast, great acting, super dialogs and highly emotional, intense, beautiful and subtle moments.",Léon - The Professional
186,JaydoDre,"Weak dialogue sometimes,an awesome film otherwise",8,6 February 2015,"Let us talk about the elephant in the room: the 13 year-old Natalie Portman as Mathilda...with that choker and that bob haircut and that conveniently barren shoulder. I suppose it was OK for me to drool over her because I myself was about the same age as her when the movie first came out and yes, my eyes were eating the screen when she was on it. The creators knew very well what they were doing with the subject matter because they emphasize that stuff and make it part of the plot, especially in the extended addition of the movie. In the end they do keep it clean. In fact, while parts of the movie go to lengths in order to sexualize the situation, the other parts go equally far in order to keep the material palatable. For example, the main premise of the story is that Mathilda ends up living with and developing an affection for Leon the hit-man, played by Jean Reno. However, Leon's character is still a boy at heart, who never got to grow up due to the hardships in his life, which evens out the psychological levels of these two characters and makes the relationship more innocent and acceptable. Luc Besson's obsession is with showing distressed but strong hot women with guns that get thrown into the men's world. This creates a contrast like when a woman poses on a bike contrasting tender flesh against masculine machine. And Leon is perhaps the best of Luc's female experiments. In the movie ""La Femme Nikita"" it was a woman but she was at least a grown woman. In a movie like ""Lucy"" the character quickly becomes completely overpowered and the vulnerability factor is lost. In Leon, on the other hand, it really is a lonely little girl up against the mobsters - you cannot get any more of a contrast than that. Sadly some of the effect is lost due to the way Mathilda ends up being portrayed. This character as well as her relation to the world around her are interesting. Her interactions and chemistry with Leon are also interesting. The performance put Natalie Portman into the spotlight as an actress, but her dialogue is not great.Perhaps the single largest problem in the film is the dialogue. This movie has so much awkward, simplistic cheesy action-movie dialogue, pointing out the obvious and not giving the viewer anything deep to think about. It sounds like something that would be written by a teenage boy, perhaps for a comic book. Matilda's character suffers most of all because she sounds nothing like a kid of her age would sound (which I suppose is a problem more movies suffer from). Just take the title of the film, which is a typical example of this movie's writing. There is nothing wrong with just ""Leon"", since that is a main character's name. But the full title of the film is ""Leon: the Professional"". ""The professional"" is just such a cheesy thing to put in the title, like something from a teenager's comic book or an 80s B action movie. The acting is great though. My favorite and never disappointing is Gary Oldman as the main baddie. It feels like this guy puts all of himself behind this performance. There are scenes in this film that make you wonder how close he came damaging his vocal chords or dangerously increasing his blood pressure. One could say that his performance gets very close to overacting, but he totally pulls it off. This is one of his best performances.The movie looks phenomenal. It has peculiar grungy look. When I was younger watching this movie dubbed in my language it left an impression in my memory that it took place somewhere in Europe even though it is supposed to be New York. People's sweating faces and the cramped apartments with their run down dirty walls combined with Jean Reno's French accent and shot in a warm sepia tone give this film a foreign look. Its looks have characterThe soundtrack of this film mixes very well with the visuals. There is a memorable crying violin theme and menacing heavy drums mixed in with atmospheric hums. Those violins give weight to the torment and I swear I could feel the heat getting heavier. If we want to find another problem with the film we have to go back to the girl. Look, for men who are not parents the whole age limit thing is bullsh*t, whether they would like to admit it or not, and by default guys are basically dogs, so parading a 12 / 13 year old girl in a choker is a cheap trick for a movie maker. Arguably, Leon is an exploitation movie. It just happens to be a very good one, but I feel like our guard is down when reviewing this film due to our mind having been affected by the material. It is like Nabokov's Lolita. Suuure you are reading the book just for its literary qualityThis may calculate in your consideration when deciding which version of the movie to watch. The Extended Cut of the film adds almost half an hour of film with a lot of additional story that actually changes the meaning and dynamic of the movie. The added content is considerably more emotional, sexual but also silly and funny. The short version is cleaner but far less emotionally loaded, cutting out one especially important heart to heart scene.Leon is a little silly and exploitative but it is one of the best thrillers and one of Luc Besson's best work.",Léon - The Professional
187,isantistao,DON'T BELEIVE THE HYPE,1,22 November 2020,"I tried watching this movie after reading all the positive reviews. But it seems the positive reviews come from people who don't have a critical eye for cinema, don't care if a movie is realistic or not, don't care if it is overdramatized or makes any sense, or anything like that. The problem is that this is not a sci fi movie. These are things that are necessary for a crime movie, especially of this nature. This is not the matrix or some sort of martial arts film. It is a organized crime/hitman movie. And in these movies you expect things to be realistic and believable, not overdramatized and downright silly. And thats what this movie is. It is ridiculously unrealistic and just ludicrous. Nothing in it is believable or makes sense. And I am not talking about in an artistic cinematic way either. I'm talking about the way in which you'd expect a movie to look if it was made by a teenager. This movie seems like it was made my someone who doesn't know anything about organized crime, or the real world, or film making. I'm not sure why people would be giving it good ratings, unless they were the same in that. I sat there incredulously for as long as I could before turning it off, but I didn't even make it through the first act, it was that bad.",Léon - The Professional
188,mr_popcorn,"McCheesy's take on ""Leon""",10,13 May 2008,"Leon is an immigrant hit-man who works for an Italian guy named Tony. He lives a lonely life only his plant accompanying him in his solace. His seemingly desolate life takes a screeching right turn when a neighboring family gets killed by crooked DEA agents. Only poor Mathilda survived the onslaught so Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing teaching her his skills as an assassin so Mathilda can exact revenge to the agents.Jean Reno plays hit-man Leon in this captivating tale of self discovery and finding that one person who gives you a taste of life. Director Luc Besson created a masterpiece. His style is unique, the flow of the story never gets in your nerves instead it gets in your heart. In the earlier parts of the film, the character Leon is established as a stone cold contract killer but as the film progresses, we realize that he is as gentle as a puppy dog. Mathilda gave him a reason to live and rediscover life again. She had given him and I quote ""A taste of life"".Superb acting from a then young Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman as the crooked DEA agent Stan was creepy as hell (as in every of his role). An interesting character sure and he's the yang of Leon's yin (or vice versa whatever). He likes his walkman (no iPod back then), he likes Beethoven...and Mozart. And he gets in a trance-like funk whenever he takes his green loopy pills. Leon on the other hand is excellently portrayed by Jean Reno. He too, is an interesting character and he will go down as one of the most memorable hit-man in cinema history. He likes his milk, he wears knitted bonnets because he can't afford to catch a cold and he has mastered the art of killing efficiently. A beast that was tamed by an 18 year old girl...13. Just like what Ann Darrow is to King Kong.Rest assured the ending will make you sad. ""Leon"" is a memorable film to be remembered from here to eternity.",Léon - The Professional

190,datorsiers2,Excellence.,10,27 December 2014,"Possibly one of the best movies ever made. By reading about the movie, it looks like the movie is just a blatant action movie, where a 12 year old girl gets trained by a professional hit-man and then becomes an extreme war machine, killing everyone on sight. Fortunately, that was not the case with this movie, the movie was exceptionally executed. I can bet nobody expected the movie to go like it did, didn't actually had so many killings as everyone would expect from a movie like this.The ending was not what everybody expected, i expected an insane bloodbath, which it kinda was, but not to the extent it usually goes in action movies. And the thing that the ''bad guy'' actually outsmarted Leon at the end was, of course, unexpected, since that never happens.The movie was something incredibly original, have not ever seen a movie quite like this, little girl Mathilda completely changed the life of cold hearted assassin Leon, who knew only how to kill, she learned him about compassion and friendship. The bond Leon and Mathilda were able to make between them was something special and hard to imagine, where else can you see a 12 year old girl ''loving'' a 40 year old man. Leon didn't express his love until the very end, when they made their separate paths, but i think he felt something special, maybe he finally remembered his old love and the feelings he had and embraced Mathilda as his love.Even though Natalie Portman was only 12 in this movie, her performance was excellent, by watching this movie, everyone can see the reason why she grew up to be such a great actress, obviously had great skills in her youth.",Léon - The Professional

Natalie Portman is superb.,9,16 October 2013,"'Léon' is a classic.The plot is gripping and dramatic, keeps you on edge.It starts off with the brutal killings of Mathilda's family but she isn't there at the time so avoids it. She comes back while the bad guys are still there and knocks on Léon's door hoping for help. This scene could have been so simple with the door just opening, but I loved how emotional this bit was. This is where I really started to feel for the characters as we saw through the spy hole tears running down Natalie Portman's face. This is where the film really starts as the two plot revenge together. The character development in this one is just great. The action scenes are just fantastic and so fast paced. The acting is excellent (How Natalie Portman didn't win any awards for her role as Mathilda I don't know).It's hard to go into more details without potentially spoiling this one, just be sure to watch it.

Mainly those relating to a possible sexual attraction between Leon and Mathilda. I didn't particularly enjoy these additional scenes, I did not really feel they added much to the story.

Absolutely beautiful acting by jean Reno and natalie Portman. I truly believe they should both win Oscars if they didnt already. The characters were so well developed and interesting. The actors did a phenomenal job at making you feel so many emotions and connections with them. Even other supporting actors and everyone in between did great in their roles. Well done.Cinematography:
Great shots and scenes that are filled with purpose and emotion. It feels like the director took inspiration from many things and spliced them into cinema. Everything was well done and stands the test of time.Story:
Who ever wrote this deserves a glass of milk. Extremely interesting story all the way through. It has many moments where the viewer gets connected with emotion and suspense with the duo. It has funny moments, sad moments and perfectly timed action moments too. Theres something in the film for everyone. The writing, dialog and plot direction was perfect. The only reasoning this is getting just shy of a 10 is because of a few things. I didnt like the awkward kind of crush/love Matilda had for leon. It was really strange and took away from the sweet father daughter relationship they had. Also I didnt really like the ending. I'm all fine with a good send off but the Tony guy seems like the biggest jerk in history. It looks like to me that Tony is just manipulating the girl and isnt going to pay her out. (Without giving things away) what happens from there? Its extremely tragic as there is no proper carer or family left. Other than those things I did throughly enjoy this movie throughout.Summary:
This film has everything you could want as a viewer. Its almost perfect besides the things I stated above. I would highly encourage anyone who is reading this review to give this a watch, its fantastic.",Léon - The Professional

I'm not typically a fan of action films because of their poor reputation for substance and originality, but this film had a coolness about it in the main characters that spoke to me easier than the other shoot-em-up movies.Natalie Portman plays a great role (for her younger days) as the girl whose life is on the list of the murderer of her family. She falls head over heels for Léon, who is a hired ""cleaner"" or hit-man, and starts to train herself to be like him. As she trains, she finds herself growing up in a different way, and Léon finds out what love and learning a different point of view can help in his life.I loved the moody music in the right places and the direction of the scenes was poignant and revealing. The story was grandiose, complete with backstory on why Léon started picking-off people and how his rules apply to the little girl's life, and it added the extra points onto this movie's reputation for being as great as it is.

203,chvylvr80,A true Professional,10,24 October 2003,"Leon must be the greatest movie about a hitman. Luc Besson perfectly tells the story of Leon, a lonely man that only has his work to keep him busy. This film is a lot more than just a gritty story about killing though.
Jean Reno is an underrated actor and quite charming. He brings Leon to life and adeptly shows his transformation from soulless killer to a man who realizes that life involves living and loving and not killing. Natalie Portman does a fine job of being the object of Leon's affections. Although some people see this movie as having barely veiled pedophile overtones, all of the scenes with Reno and Portman are innocent and nothing is implied I think. Gary Oldman pulls off an incredible performance as the evil, corrupt DEA agent Stansfield. His performance is over the top but it's great fun to watch.The gunfights in this film are some of the best ever captured and make this movie a great action film. Leon truly is a professional.

It's very original and very unusual, the love that grows between two incredibly unusual characters is surprisingly well done and very brave. If you try to explain the film to someone it's very bizarre 'how could an Italian hit-man befriend and fall in love with a 12 year old child'. This really is the genius of Luc Besson. He's able to make a very strange idea and insert some beautifully crafted scenes of violence, but still come out with a very credible film, that's overriding memory is the love between the two characters and not the revenge or the violence that takes place.Overall this film has a wonderful charm, the love that develops, although improbable, is wonderfully realised and believable. The acting is superb and there's some great 'dirty harry' style lines thrown in which make a light relief now and again.Since watching Nikita and this movie, I began to believe I'd found a new hero in Besson, after Cronenberg, Carpenter and Cameron had all lost their way (in my opinion), but of course besson went on to make 'The Fifth Element ' which disappointed me.Please Luc, watch Nikita, and Leon and remind yourself how good you can be.10/10By the way  For anyone who hasn't seen the full version, which I was lucky enough to see, it's well worth it.",Léon - The Professional

207,dhaufrect-1,"""Leon: The Professional"" is a great film.",10,20 May 2015,"""Leon: The Professional"" is a great movie from 1994. The director and the writer is Luc Besson. It is currently on NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal. The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be. Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants. The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.

To start with, the relationship of Leon, a hardcore hit-man that talks to plants and doesn't relate at all to the world, and Mathilda, a girl that is moved away from her family nucleus to find real love, a paternal figure on Leon. Both Jean Reno and Nathalie Portman seem born to this role, so natural. They feed a bizarre, uncommon couple that lights on their talents and their lateral chemistry. Gary Oldman is a beast, in every single way. He enjoys performing a DEA agent that has very little respect for everything. When he shouts ""Bring me EVERYOOONEEE!"", one can see that his acting is intense, visceral and passionate.Leon is an excellent story, any way you see it. The script makes us jump into a two side story: an action packed ride and an emotional, story that has never talked so brilliantly about love (but not luscious love).See it, its a basic film.

213,Kubris,Charming and brutal,9,26 August 2012,"IMDb Top 250: 33I think a big part of why this film was so good is that it could've been so bad. Consider the alternate film this may have been: an icy, one- dimensional hit-man somehow pairs with a bratty young girl to face a drugged police character in this summer's brainmelting blockbuster.But it's not that. It came out as Leon: The Professional.Leon is a special film. It channels classics like Taxi Driver, Batman, and many many New York films but has its own unique identity. Part thriller, part drama, the film is touching and exciting, and reels you in from its stellar first scene and takes you for a fantastic adventure.The story, while having the possibility of being off-putting, works. Sure you can question the relationship between Leon and Mathilda (depending on the cut of the film you saw, I saw the International cut and everything was fine), but I found it more reasonable than say the relationships in Doctor Zhivago and Lolita. Anyway, the story- it's original and takes many turns, but stays on track and never slows without reason.A story only goes so far: the biggest success of Leon is its 3 main characters. Jean Reno IS Leon, I can't see anyone doing any better. As the cold, solitary hit-man who is handed a very different responsibility, we grow to love Leon with his quirky persona of houseplant caring, movie watching and chair sleeping. He is an iconic character with his sunglasses and low voice. His developed duality is remarkable to behold.Leon is complimented by the fiery Mathilda played by the extraordinarily young Natalie Portman, the smoking, swearing kid who grew up with a tough life. As unbelievable as her choices may seem on paper, I totally got behind her reasoning and never found her to do anything horribly distasteful. The duo of killer father and eager daughter is one of the greatest in film.That leaves the sick Stansfield as the target of the duo's revenge. Played by Gary Oldman, one of the greatest actors of all time, the psychotic, pill-popping shady cop is truly despicable, with his scenes of drug consumption and Beethoven rant to be extremely unsettling.The bread and butter of film is great. There are many shots that I found interesting and unique, and the cinematography and editing is all top notch. The music, decidedly the most French thing about the whole film, is juxtaposed to anything happening on-screen and helps make the film's identity, especially in the bonding scenes between Leon and Mathilda.There is a double-edged sword about the film. We see Leon's killer side, and we see him as an awkward caregiver, like in the dress-up game. This mix keeps the audience guessing and keeps the film entertaining. It all culminates in a poetic ending that couldn't be any better or more satisfying.From start to finish, Leon is awesome. It has artistic credibility, awesome action scenes, great characters and acting, as well as the brick and mortar that makes film work. I had never heard of it before seeing the Top 250, and I don't know why it isn't bigger. See this film!9.4/10",Léon - The Professional

Their chemistry is the heart of the movie and it's both funny and emotional to watch them together and see how even a hitman has a heart. It's not an entirely unique story, but this one does it incredibly well. Gary Oldman's performance is one to be mentioned as well, really nailing the role as a sociopathic and corrutpt DEA agent.The acting, cinematography and editing is overall very impressive, and the action scenes are very well done.Overall, this is an amazing and emotional movie, and truly a testament to the greatness of Besson!",Léon - The Professional

Many of the action scenes are hokey, and some of acting was cheesy. Portman was amazing, though. Even at 12 years old, you could see the immense talent, beauty, and passion that were waiting to be unleashed upon the world. However, it was a bit disturbing how Besson tried to sex her up in some of the scenes... Ultimately, this film is about redemption, and how true family can sometimes be forged through fire, instead of genes. While it was awesome for its time period, the bar has been raised for movies a great deal in the last 18 years.

It is often wondered why Lyon brought the pot of greens wherever he went, and why at the last crisis, he still asked Mattier to take care of a plant. What a curious plant. Lulu is the best evidence that Lyon is not a good killer. Luolu represents the weak, those who need protection and care, and the love that Lyon once could not protect. In fact, Lyon wanted to love someone, protect her, take care of her, and care for her. If that person doesn't show up, then he has to fill this emptiness with a pot of green dill. Mattier was like a pot of green lush flowers, filling his wounded heart.
The spiral staircase, brown and black, reveals the simple and solemn and depressed atmosphere. Step by step up the stairs, rotate, rotate, lost with the rotation of the stairs, at the end of the rotation, an elf-like girl is waiting quietly. Unruly smoking a cigarette, pretending to have a mature conversation. In the beginning, it is often inadvertent.
Knowing that in your own identity, it is best not to provoke the police who are not as good as crazy dogs. However, in the face of Matil's cry of begging, his cold heart began to melt. The door opened, Lyon greeted Matil, giving her a haven, and at the same time giving her lonely heart a chance to redeem.
As a result, this elf-like, mature and naive girl stubbornly stuck in Lyon's life and would never leave again.

229,IamROCKAS,Natalie Portman was brilliant but some plot-driven decisions seemed off to me,6,14 March 2021,"My biggest take from this movie is that young Natalie Portman was a badass. I imagine a lot of people might find Mathilda's character as uncomforting but seeing as she came from a troubling family, most likely with no friends, her character arc makes a lot of sense for me. To some extent, she even reminded me of Wan-Chu, the disturbed girl from Dangerous Encounters of the First Kind (1980), both by looks and violent tendencies. Of course, she's not as destructive and might be viewed as a watered-down version of Wan-Chu, but she definitely wasn't boring and was badass enough for my taste. For me, these kinds of disturbing and troubled characters always seemed more entertaining than your average ""walk-in-the-park"" characters.Even though the plot is action-driven with a great premise - a young pre-teen girl teaming up with a hitman after an unfortunate demise of her whole family - this movie didn't really go too well with me. I don't know whether it's the lack of the X-factor that would push me over the hump of excitement or the fact that Gary Oldman's character was the only one that couldn't be viewed as just a redshirt character. The movie was exciting to some extent but the over-the-top plot was a bit of a turn-off for me. The ending was emotional but the shootout was a bit ridiculous. I know Leon is viewed as a professional and a threat but sending 200 guys just for him and the way it went down just didn't click with me.Besides what I mentioned already, I'd like to say that the violent scenes are top-notch and the romance, whether disturbing or not, was cute and kind of shows how easy it is to dream for girls of that age. I don't think there's anything wrong with the cast and their talent, it was just the key plot moment weren't as enjoyable as they could have been. If rating just the portion of the movie before Mathilda went off to the DEA building, I'd rate it way higher, or even if the finale of the movie took place by Leon saving Mathilda from Gary Oldman's character, I'd think the scenery would be greater to end things off.",Léon - The Professional

231,joshuafagan-64214,Possibly the Best Action Film Ever Made,10,31 January 2016,"This movie is art in its purest state. It refuses to follow any boundaries of what should be done and what should not be done, what is acceptable and what is not acceptable. I have never seen a freer movie. It flies like a boundless bird above the mountains and hills and cities.The closest thing I can compare it to are those moments when the protagonist takes their love interest on a flight through the clouds. You the viewer are the love interest. The film is the dark and mysterious protagonist.But even looking past all that, and even looking past the mostly fantastic characters (Gary Oldman is hit-or-miss as the villain, but he does not ruin the film), this movie is fantastic because of its blend of art and action. Outside of MM: FR, I have never seen a movie that blends those two elements so gloriously. Under poor hands, art and action neuter each other. But under expert hands, they amplify each other and create something that will last, that deserves to last.I wish Besson would make another film this great, this beautiful.The first shot of the film is a pan shot over Central Park. Now, normally, this would be nothing more than a standard shot to show our setting, but they way they shoot it makes CP resemble a forbidden jungle or something of the sort, thus giving off the impression that this film will cover the dark and wild side of NYC. It is one of the best opening shots I've ever seen.Every time you think the story is going to zig, it zags. But nothing ever comes off as forced or contrived. In every good story, you are confident the creator knows what they're doing. I always got that feeling when I was watching this film. Combine that with the unconventionality I describes earlier and you have a truly beautiful piece of art.I'm willing to bet you'll feel uncomfortable at times when you're watching the film. This is not a bad thing. Art is not meant to keep you comfortable. It is meant to evoke and make you look at the world differently. There is nothing squicky enough to make any reasonable person turn off the film, but some of the interactions between the assassin and Natalie Portman can make some people shaky. Quickly: she grows to lust for him. He does not take advantage of that, but if you're turned off by such things, you're better off either not watching the film at all or watching the far inferior theatrical cut.This film is everything blockbusters want to be and everything they would never think of being.

233,Keyser Soze-12,Who knew an action movie could be so touching?,8,14 December 2000,"Leon had become one of my favourite movies.  It's not great in a Schindler's List or Gladiator way, though.  It's different.  It's moving.  It touches the audience's emotions like no other movie could.  Well, here I go...Happy Premise Number 1:  The characters.  This is my favourite part of the film.  Leon is a simple man.  He doesn't ask for much.  He drinks milk in place of beer or liquir, he doesn't smoke, he loves children, and he goes to see old musicals like Singing in the Rain in old theatres.  Oh, and he's a hitman.  His personality is the exact opposite of what you would expect a hit man to be.  He is a sweet and gentle man who goes to work everyday. That's how he sees it.  It's work, business.  Someone has to do it, and he has a gift for what he does.  Okay, so what he does isn't legal, but he is the best in the field, so he has to do it.  The other characters are good, but Leon is terrific.Happy Premise Number 2: Great acting.  I don't think the word ""great"" really portrays what I mean.  I know a lot of people say Natalie Portman to be great, but I found her performance to be average.  Gary Oldman gives one of the best villian performances I've ever seen.  His rage and insanity is brilliant.  Jean Reno, one of my favourite actors, stars as Leon.  He pulls off the gentleness perfect.Happy Premise Number 3: the action.  This is an ACTION movies.  Don't let anyone else tell you different.  The action, while not the centre of the movie, is great.  every action scene is choreographed perfectly.  The explosions are the best.  There is an explosion near the end that made me jump.  It looked so real!  People were only a few feet from this gigantic blast.  To this day, it still amazes me.Happy Premise Number 4: Luc Besson.  This is his best film to date.  The Fifth Elemnt was fun, but a little over board.  Everytime I see that movie I see a large TILT sign hoveing over my TV.  I never saw The Messenger, but it was trashed by just about everyone and tanked at the boxoffice.  This film truly shows him at the top of his game.  The cinematography ,the direction, the writing, it's all good my frined, it's all good.Okay, lets seep into some negative things.Depressing Premise Number 1:  The film's American release.  When the movie was brought to America, they cut the movie drastically.  They even changed the named from Leon to The Professional.  If you are going to see this film, please rent the DVD called Leon: The Professional.  It features the original movie.  The box says that the new scenes were considered too violent for American auidences, but that's an advertising ploy.  There's nothing violent added to Leon.  They are mainly character build up scenes and a great scene were Leon takes Matilda to ""work"".  It is sad that most of us Americans have never seen the true film.   But the cut version is good anyway, so if you can only find the cut version, it's still good.Depressing Premis Number 2: Ummmmmm, can't think of anything.  This film is perfect.  There is nothing wrong with it whatsoever.  Like I said, it's not an epic masterpiece like Gladiator or Hamlet, but it is an extremly good movie none-the-less.Conclusion: SEE THIS MOVIE.  It should please everyone.  There's action for guys, a touching story for gals, and a great combination of both for we film people.  It is worth the money for a rent.  PLEASE SEE THIS MOVIE.  You will like it.  You may not think it was that special, but you WILL like it. Like I said, the movie isn't a masterpiece, but it is flawless, fun, and will touch your heart.8/10(note: I rarly ever give a movie above an 8)",Léon - The Professional
234,Alcaminhante,I can´t believe some people accuse this movie of supporting pedophilia !! This is an amazing film !,10,18 May 1999,"I think the people who accuse this movie of promoting pedophilia are totally missing the point here. But i don´t agree with the ones who defend it as being nothing more than a big friendship story either.This is a Love story all right.Once again LUC BESSON has managed to create and film another truly original and impossible adult love story in wich love is presented first of all as an emotion.Like in "" BIG BLUE/LE GRAND BLEU "", BESSON is much more interested in presenting Love as a pure human feeling than as something that is conditioned by the actual modern society.In other movies love is always depending on external factors and almost controls the story and the characters. When LUC BESSON films it, love is always present but in a pure and subtle way, that apparently doesn´t interfere directly in the main story, but ends up being the cause of it.He films it only as an emotion that isn´t depending in gender, race,sex, or in this case age. That´s why he never uses this emotion to create the usual subplots for his movies. Because it´s too pure and simple and it would be very dificult to invent some conflicts for the story and at the same time keep it like that.Maybe i´m sounding too intellectual, but i can´t find another way to explain what i think. That´s what i like about Luc Besson. He first makes us feel, then he makes us think.So this is why i think there is nothing dirty about this movie. Pedophilia here is on the minds of the people who wish to see it. There is a love story between Leon and Mathilda, but it´s just that. Love.True love, if you like. Everybody can imagine they have sex if they want to, but don´t go blame the movie for it.The only dirty shamefull scenes in LEON are in the minds of the people who wished they were there in the first place. Of course everyone thinks about the possibility of sex between Leon and Mathilda, but that´s not because of what´s in the movie. It´s because we are conditioned to think this way.There is nothing wrong with this movie. It´s original, it has a fabulous story, very human characters, excellent action scenes and amazing actors. And it has style ! JEAN RENO is an amazing actor as he had already proved in "" THE BIG BLUE "", and it´s great to see him in a role where he can show is worth for a change. Unfortunately in Hollywood no one seems to have noticed this because his later characters in american productions have all been nothing more than cardboard clichés. But that´s Hollywood.The rest of the cast couldn´t have been better.

236,DoctorSkyTower,ONE OF MY FAVORITES,10,24 January 2000,"I have seen this movie about 5 times and I still enjoy it greatly. It is one of the best movies I have seen.It is the story of a hit man Leon and an orphaned 12yr old girl Mathilda. Leon, despite being a professional killer, has nothing but a plant to love and a strangely innocent child-like look at the world. Mathilda, despite being 12 years old, is more like a street wise 20 year old. She wants Leon to teach her how to kill so she can get revenge on her family's murderers.
Their performances are absolutely the best. Normally I don't sympathize with characters in movies, but I felt for both these characters and the sad situations they were in. The evil cop was particularly nasty, so evil in fact, it's enough to make you look sideways at cops in future...
One thing that struck me while reading through the reviews was this 'sexual thing' between Leon and Mathilda. According to my interpretations, not once did I see any sexual chemistry between the two. What I saw was Leon doing his best to play the father-figure and Mathilda getting a childish crush on him simply because he cared about her welfare... and he was all she had left in her sad little world. So if you watch this movie, don't expect to see some incestuous or paedaphile-like relationship, because its simply NOT about that trash! (I watched the American version, by the way) Besides, I can't see Leon as a paedaphile...CONCLUSION: this is definitely not a movie for the easily offended or faint of heart.

I don't know if such a character is possible in real life, and I'm not sure about the message of the film, if there's any, but the fact is that I find good acting, good music and a film with which you don't get bored. My rating is 7 out of 10.",Léon - The Professional
246,albrechtcm,"Starting with Luc Besson, Jean Reno, Gary Oldman, Danny Aiello and Ms. Portman - It can't get better than that.",10,15 August 2019,"When you see Luc Besson's name on a film, you have to see it. Tu m'en diras les nouvelles !In one of Danny Aiello's greatest performances, he is Tony. Tony owns and operates a small café but the real money comes from his sideline as an ""arranger"" for the various mobs.One of those is the Badge-toting Dapper Don Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his private crew, where he carries on his own sideline within the NYPD. The sideline being drugs and cold-blooded murder etc. not to mention some mysterious but explosive capsules with which he comes armed for that often needed ""super rush"".The star here is, of course, Jean Reno, aka Léon. Léon is not ra complete innocent. Rather, I believe he is simply immature. From conversations between Tony, Léon's mentor (and "" banker"", we gather that Léon was a lost kid on the streets of NY when Tony took him in and taught him his trade. The trade of assassination; that is. Clearly Léon took to that line of work readily because he is now well versed in every sort of weapon and explosive, most of which he carries with him beneath his large loose overcoat.Even here, I have a feeling that Léon isn't just a cold-blooded natural-born killer, but rather that Tony convinces Léon that his targets are very bad people and it is Léon's job to ""take care"" of them.The relationship between Tony and Léon is so unique that it's a story in itself. Tony treats Léon like a kid, doling out money as needed to pay the rent on his tiny tenement apartment, corn flakes and milk (apparently just about all Leon ever eats and drinks and the occasional movie where this loner goes and stares as if having a religious experience as he watches Gene Kelly sing and dance. His only friend is a leafy green plant for which he cares consciencially.When the ju ject of money comes up, Tony always reminds Léon that it's Léon's money. Tony is just the caretaker. Banks get involved with paperwork and taxes. Tony keeps it all in his head. No paperwork, and Tony assures Léon that he's not going anyplace, except to the kitchen and back.So while it's obvious to us that Tony is the one getting rich from Leon's work, we still feel that there's a warm relationship between them and in a pinch, Tony would always try to take care of Leon..Detective Stansfield on the other hand has one of his greatest performances as well. As the more than ruthless, drug-fuzzed detective, he doesn't mind - make that, actually enjoys - bumping people off, men, women, children and if one happened to pass by, maybe a dog or two as well.Living on the same floor as Léon, Matilda is a precocious 12-year-old abused child with hopeless parents. She often escapes to the inner balcony where she and Léon say, ""Hi"", in passing.Only her little brother is dear to her. When her drug-dealing dad can't come up with the money for Stansfield, he comes back with his crew and murders everyone including Matilda's little brother.
Thus begins another great relationship between Matilda and Léon. Although only twelve years old, Matilda tries to convince Léon that he should teach her ""the ropes"" so she can take revenge on Stansfield.Without including spoilers, I just have to say that the relationships between Leon and Tony, the relationship between Leon and Matilda, the relationships between all of them and Stansfield as well as the relationship between Matilda and Tony, all, each and every one of them, is a little story in itself and much more subtle than we're used to getting.We're just not used to subtle relationships. After all, this is a population that apparently believes TV ads that assure us that these are:: ""Real people, not actors"".Another point that has been criticized is that Stansfield seems so ""aware"" I'm certainly no expert, but I can certainly believe that when Stansfield pops those ""super "" capsules, they must heighten all his senses giving him almost extra-sensory feelings about those around him.I've seen this film several times and I enjoy it as mure or even more with each viewing. Best films so far for Monsieur Besson, Jean Reno, Danny Aiello, Gary Oldman and - well,what can we say about Natalie Portman?I have to admit that I haven't see any of her other films.

253,Better_Sith_Than_Sorry,"Inspired by ""Home Alone""",6,26 May 2021,"Both ""Leon"" and ""Home Alone"" contain plot elements involving a young child doing things one would find not very likely to happen, or even remotely possible. ""Home Alone"" of course was a comedy, so you can laugh at the silliness of it while realizing all along that it's preposterous. But does that idea still work in a film you are supposed to take seriously?Plot In a Nutshell: A young girl left orphaned by a drug hit on her family is taken in and mentored by her next door neighbor, who happens to be a lethal assassin.Why I rated it a '6': Because the plot is as silly as it sounds. It actually DOES sound like a comedy, doesn't it? Sadly, it's not. And it's all the worse for it. Who really thinks a loner hitman would do this? How about bringing the girl to an orphanage? Or Child Services in the city? Hello? Well, no, because then you wouldn't have a movie. But does anyone really think an actual contract killer would take in a little girl, and not only that, but begin to train her in the ways of an assassin? Count me out. This isn't compelling theater. It's fantasy all the way, and not very riveting at that. Not for a second did I find myself invested in this plotline. I kept thinking ""if I was a hitman, would I do this?"" and the answer kept coming back ""Uh, no you would not."" So the film's story lost me very early on, and it could not get me back. The fact that this unrealistic fantasy (yet set in the real world) is currently #31 on the IMDb Top 250 is pretty hilarious. For all the wrong reasons of course.Roger and me: In his 1994 review Roger Ebert gave this film 2.5/4 stars, calling it ""a romantic fantasy, not a realistic crime picture,"" and he was right on the money.

254,jonathandoe_se7en,"""It's when you start to become really afraid of death that you learn to appreciate life"".",10,7 September 2001,"This is the only Luc Besson film that left me feeling satisfied, I think with his previous films (Subway, La Femme Nikita) and in his two films that followed (The Fifth Element, The Messenger) he focused too much on the look and atmosphere of the film, whereas the story just seemed either too stupid or too rushed to make any sense. With Leon however, he got it right.
Leon (aka The Professional) is the story of Leon (Jean Reno), a lone hit man who lives a bohemian lifestyle, moving from one low rent apartment to the next whilst making his hits. But after his twelve year old neighbour (Natalie Portman) has her family wiped out by crooked cop Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) Leon is forced to take the girl under his wing and eventually both teach the other a little something about life. Leon is a fantastic action film; it has great characters, brilliant use of mise-en-scene and a chic Eric Serra score. It also has a heart, and at times the scenes can be quite touching, ""I wanna have roots, sleep in a bed, never be alone again Mathilda"" confesses Leon as he must make an important decision. The central message also has a lot of importance, as Stansfield says to Mathilda ""It's when you start to become really afraid of death that you learn to appreciate life"", this becomes clear for Leon, as he realises that this little girl is leading him into a situation that will be hard to get out of. I'd recommend this film to anyone, the final shoot out in the apartment is one of the best action sequences I've ever seen and the three leads (especially Reno and Oldman) are fantastic, and there's fine support from Danny Aiello as Leon's friend and advisor.Leon is a striking film too often ignored by the wannabe cinefile set who dismiss it as an exercise in style, too caught up with the likes of Goddard to expand their horizons to a new kind of film making.

I almost cried several times the first time I watched it. Did Natalie Portman and Jean Reno really acted or was all this in reality? It has great action scenes, but it is also an unusual love story!Therefore this is a very controversial movie. Between Léon and Mathilda, a forbidden love appears that Léon tries to deny. I don't only see it as a father-daughter love relation. Perhaps also some watchers denies that, but it stills remains in there. It shows the courage that Luc Besson possesses. Some would say that is a bad message, I think it is interesting and comprehensionly. In a situation like Mathilda was getting into, perhaps a girl would act like she did. Said about Natalie Portman: ""If you want an example of her divine acting talent look for the scene near the start. Ringing Leon's doorbell and the tearful expression on her face as she silently begs to be let in while a hitman looks on!"" commented by akira-51 at imdb.com ""Portman is masterful in expressing the anguish of a young woman will to use any means (including, reluctantly, her body) to get what she needs."" commented by Bob-45 at imdb.com Said about 'Lèon': ""I feel this would have to be Besson's best movie to date, with Nikita a close second.

260,Manthorpe,"A difficult review to give...but a good film, and an absolute must for Oldman fans.",10,15 February 2004,"Leon is a hard movie to write a review for, as it's not your typical action film, nor is it your normal romance...and I don't think it's truly either one, but the basic elements are there.Natalie Portman displays her natural acting abilities, that will no doubt be honed into perfection as she gets older, and is perfect for her role as Matilda. In fact, it's one of the most memorable child roles that I have seen. Her attitude and confidence can sometimes be very surprising. Jean Reno does a decent job, but his simple role doesn't seem too difficult a one to pull off. However, it also works. He's sometimes downright goofy and almost retarded, but is meant to show the simplicity of his character. Which brings us to the unparalleled and wickedly talented Gary Oldman, who portrays a particularly nasty and evil character. His Norman Stansfield seems to be spawned from Hell itself. Oldman is not new to playing villains, and he gets to showoff his amazingly intense acting abilities even further in this character. Born to be the bad guy, and probably my favorite actor. His performance alone is reason enough to watch this movie.The story is simple, but very unique, particularly the ""romantic"" aspect. We've got a 40 year old man and a 12 year old girl basically falling in love with each other, which can probably make a few people uneasy. I raised and eyebrow or two myself, with it's sexual undertones and hinted at implications. I don't think the director went too far though, and feel that he showed just enough without going overboard. Even with that, some people may still find it a bit unnerving given the ""romance"". Personally, I don't think Besson had anything dirty that he was trying to imply and that all of what you see is all of what happened between the two in the director's mind. I will admit, that sometimes I think the cute moments in the film were trying to hard and could have been cut down just a teeny bit. The dress up game and the infamous cow mit scenes are perfect examples.On the other hand, we have the intense and sometimes seemingly over the top actions scenes. A few parts in the movie seem so insane because the city seems to be devoid of police, or the ability for people to dial 911. However, many times life does imitate art, so who's to say what's realistic and what is not? Some of it seems almost cartoonish sometimes, but I'm willing to forgive a little of that here and there and it doesn't take away too much from the film, if at all.Leon contains some beautiful camera work, and the score seems to compliment the almost opera like feel it's pace and story also suggest. It all adds up to a stunning visual treat, combined with a touching story.

It combines together two starkly different narratives: the revenge story and the love story. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman in her debut film role were great together. They provided a lot of the humour in the film, as did Gary Oldman who was brilliant as Stansfield.SPOILER ALERTThe main gripe I do have with the film though is that Natalie Portman's character never kills anyone. Sure, I understand that it is a romantic gesture that it is Leon who is the one who kills Stanfield, but I feel that Portman's character should have been the one to do it.

265,verna-a,The worship of violence,4,12 November 2020,"Ok, so it's a suspenseful and watchable movie. But I did watch it with a growing disbelief that we are expected to swallow the messages implicit in the story : that because bad stuff happens to people they are entitled to turn into serial murderers, and while they are doing this, somewhere inside they are deeply loveable and can be redeemed by their devotion to one other person. This is peddled by depicting the vast majority of people as mean, evil or stupid so that their deaths mean nothing. And in this bloody universe, the thing to worship is guns. Firearms of all sorts are lovingly depicted as is the mayhem they create. This is the blackness at the heart of America, the sick and probably doomed society. I know Besson is a Frenchman, but he appears to fully embrace the American noir. If the violence wasn't sickening enough, there is extra sleaze in depicting the adolescent Portman as a titillating nymphet. I have a feeling I should have constantly made signs to ward off the devil while watching the film. This sort of film has deadened me to violence to a considerable extent, or I couldn't have watched it through to the end, but hopefully I have retained enough objectivity to know that humanity is reaching a pretty low ebb to serve this sort of thing up as entertainment.",Léon - The Professional

Léon tells the tale of Mathilda ( Natalie Portman), a twelve-year old girl living in a family without love. Her father is involved in drug dealing for some bent cops led by the terrifying Agent Stansfeld ( Gary Oldman). When Stansfeld discovers that he is being cheated by Mathilda's father, he takes revenge by executing the entire family apart from Mathilda who escapes and seeks refuge in a neighbors flat. Léon ( Jean Reno), the neighbor, is more than he seems however, as Mathilda discovers he is actually a contract killer, and begs him to teach her how to settle her own scores.Luc Besson, the writer and director of the film, put together quite the stylish and riveting thriller here. The pace is fast moving and the action sequences are quite enjoyable.Reno gives a quite credible performance in the title role and manages to balance the conflicting elements of his character as well. Portman, as Mathilda, without a doubt gives the performance of her career here, ( to this day, still her best on film, not sure what that says about her as a performer though) with a combination of lost wolf meets driven avenger. Placing such a youngster so firmly at the center of such a violent themed film also adds to much of the tension that the film delivers.It is, however, Oldman as the psychopathic cop who steals the show. If he overplays the part just a little, who cares, it can be easily forgiven as he is indeed quite the pleasure to watch. For instance, just watch the scene where he confronts Portman's Mathilda in the bathroom, such an incredible and intense scene. I also love the scene where the old lady buts in saying something like "" Why don't you leave that family alone?""

Most hitmen aren't so genial..Frankly, a lot of bad language & graphic violence in this entry, but Gary Oldman is worth the price of admission. His performance as a crooked, quirky cop is frightening. He showed his bad guy chops 2 decades ago in 'Fifth Element' & 'Air Force One'. More recently, he portrayed Churchill in 'Darkest Hour', but I marvel at his work as the quiet, honest cop, Gordon, in the Batman entries with Christian Bale. Oldman can play under-stated or over-stated, as the occasion requires. In this one, he's a raving loonie, guaranteed to make the weirdo dating your daughter look like a prize catch.If you read the IMDb trivia, you will learn that Oldman more or less improv'd a couple of scenes in Léon, for effect. He is an immensely unlikable character in this flick-ruthless & heartless-but you can't take your eyes off him anyway.Natalie Portman, in her 12-yr old rookie appearance, shines and Jean Reno, as the 'cleaner'-gunman who becomes obliged to mentor/protect Portman, is outstanding in a role similar to another 90'S flick, Wasabi, in which he played a tough French cop (I didn't say it was a nice cop). 9/10",Léon - The Professional

I guess it's possible that some of the aforementioned cliches were derived from this movie and that would make it at least influential but I don't think many of them were.

He made a genuinely semi drama-action film which for me definitely in my top 10 best movies ever made. Despite lack of rating from movie professionals, I stated that this movie is one of the most impacts to me. The storytelling installment that this movie had was incredibly powerful, precise, and so freaking deep. It consist of a very strong bond of a little girl to a professional assassin which maybe it's too simple as shape but will plunging the audiences into his childish cry at the time, especially at the ending.In the shape of it's plot, I think Leon is one kind of movie that have a similar plot structure as Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"", but had a different style in movie making technique and how the way the story of the plot untold. Most people said the strong point of the genre was It's action. Not for me, It was the drama which intensify the whole movie. Firstly, the director wanted to slowly generated a strong bond of It's two leads. Then in the end, BAMM.. Everythings disappeared, everything destroyed, just in short period of time. It possessing a deep desperation feeling into the audience. Audience want the happy ending because of the caring and daring reason (which accumulated expeditiously because of the two lead's strong performance, especially Portman), but the real fact that Besson was brave enough to change the way of the old happy ending style implementation. Suspense skill from Besson was perfect, giving the audience to wish the ending they want, but unfortunately It's different, It's freaking sad and painful. I tear to pieces. That's what I feel when watched Leon, I had very similar feeling from City Lights (which ending's strong point was It's uncertainty of approval), two of them (the ending) had very strong impact to audience (all age range from my experience asking other older and younger people).

273,ginger_sonny,Besson's best work,10,3 August 2004,"Besson's first US film. Makes up what it lacks in depth with explosive, good looking action. Hit-man Leon (Reno) lives by a strict code of ethics on a diet of milk and sit-ups with only a pot plant for company. When bent copper Oldman murders a neighboring family, Leon reluctantly harbors the only surviving witness, pre-teen Mathilda (Portman). She pushes Leon to teach her the assassin's trade, and her desire for revenge eventually leads them into the film's ferocious climax.Oldman appears once again to swerve alarmingly towards ham, but Reno's performance of hangdog loyalty lends his character pleasing sympathy while Besson's heavily stylised direction builds tension around sexy violence.",Léon - The Professional

Obviously a very well made movie which holds your interest from beginning to credits. Natalie Portman is such a surprise, Hit Girl (Kick Ass) seems like a copy of her character. The Original score, Editing, Performances, Direction and every aspect of the movie is so well that its hard to look for negative points.The Movies portrays Action/Crime/Emotions wonderfully.And its not over violent nor fake (like in todays Hollywood flicks) the movie is authentic.I have to agree that it was Snubbed by all major Awards.I definitely will recommend this to every one, Its entertaining, touching and a very nice 128 minute experience.",Léon - The Professional
276,mallaverack,UnBeLiEvAbLe.,5,24 November 2017,"Just when you thought the large majority of reviewers on IMDb were reasonable and constructive in their analysis, along comes a film which destroys completely that impression!This movie is relentlessly and thoroughly implausible from its opening scene to the improbable closing where the sole remaining possession of Leon, a potted plant which has miraculously survived, amongst other things, walls of fire, smoke bombs and bazooka attacks, is planted in what appears to be an open lawn!Unbelievable that seemingly 80% or more of near 900 reviewers here have very strangely anointed this movie a near masterpiece. My score of 5 is over-generous considering the litany of implausible character and plot situations. The most incredulous situation is the fact that Mathilda is a 12 year old, sometimes acting her age but more often than not engaging in conversation which is not only that of a mature woman but also appears quite disturbing in light of the sexual tension depicted. And for goodness sake, what 12 year old blithely refers to long dead couples such as Bonnie and Clyde?!The age factor of Mathilda and the implausibility of her words and actions in every scene remain front and center at the startlingly obvious weakness of this movie, regardless of how brilliant Natalie Portman's performance may appear.How incredible that she seems to have taught the near illiterate Leon to read in what seems just over a week. Considering that Leon has been in the US since age 19 and has developed skills as an ace hit-man and YET still can't read English defies credibility. As for Gary Oldman's portrayal of Stansfield, how could the actions of a vicious, destructive pill-popping police officer of seniority go unnoticed? How did he reach such a position in the first place? Totally unbelievable. And how can the near destruction of a hotel in Leon's pursuit of the gangster in the opening scenes, with innumerable rounds of machine gun fire, go unnoticed by anybody else in the building. Unbelievable. No police response until the climax where seemingly hundreds of highly-armed police and commandos with flame throwers and bazookas and smoke bombs and.......absolutely UNBELIEVABLE!So over-rated, so implausible. This bilge borders on parody. Ridiculous movie-making.",Léon - The Professional
277,olliecurtis,Leon is a beautiful film,10,15 September 2020,"This film is such a great, intriguing watch. It's so unique as a concept, and the dynamic between the 2 main characters, although often divisive, is always interesting. This is thanks to two great performances from a young Natalie Portman and Jean Reno. Their on screen chemistry is very well done.This film is also great at making you hate the villains (Gary Oldman) and crafting likeable protagonists.Another great thing about Leon is how well the story flows. You're never say there wondering what is going on. Not to say that is a bad thing, films like Inception where it is tricky to get your head around are great, but sometimes you just want a simple story. It's a shame that these simple stories with logical plots often aren't very good, but it's a miracle Leon is of such fantastic quality.This is honestly a really hard film to dislike, which you could argue means it isn't doing anything special here.

My expectations for this film were not high because I had got it into my head that this was a self indulgent tale from a French director. Quite where I had got that idea from I have no idea but i was so wrong. This is one of my favourite films of all time. I love the feel of this film, I never felt comfortable for any of the characters at any time, I never really knew what the next frame would turn out to be and in many ways it was a depressing film. I think there are a lot of people out there who could identify with the character of Leon in this film because if its not yourself it could be somebody who just doesn't seem to fit in anywhere apart from one tiny aspect of life as a whole.

280,Gjay2,a symphony in film,7,25 April 2003,"luc besson will never top this movie. This is his benchmark, his classical composition. Look at the precise, intricate scenes. It's a symphony in cinema. Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.The actors are all spot on, most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry, sad, pent up, in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it, touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character, is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand, but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it, with his glorious overacting. He's as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies, then they could contend with this film. But as it stands right now, leon is one of the best action dramas ever made.",Léon - The Professional
281,Surecure,An action-suspense masterpiece,10,14 March 2007,"Luc Besson had already defined himself as a true action film craftsman with his brilliant ""La Femme Nikita"" when he bested himself with what is certainly one of the greatest action films of all time ""Leon"" (a.k.a. ""the Professional""). Combining equal parts dirty-cop/mob drama with the emotional tale of a man taking in an orphaned youngster, ""Leon"" is both thrilling and heart-wrenching to watch.Leon (played by the ever stoic Jean Reno) is the hit-man of choice for the Italian mob of New York city. When a dirty DEA agent named Stansfield (Gary Oldman) kills the family of his young neighbor Mathilda (Natalie Portman), he takes her under his wing teaching her the ways of the assassin as she teaches him of the love for life that he has been missing. But Mathilda's desire for vengeance puts herself, Leon and Stansfield on a collision course for a violent confrontation.Luc Besson certainly brings to vibrant life New York City with beautiful cinematography while crafting a tasteful crescendo of a script. Watching such an excellently composed script play out on the screen with such tasteful imagery is a real treat. As well, the score by longtime Besson collaborator Eric Serra is hypnotic and beautiful in its own right. I have often found myself coming back to the score on its own as it is at times both emotive and pulse driving.Combined with the production aspects are a collection of precision performances. Portman's screen debut certainly demonstrates why her career took off, as she grabs the viewer's eye and heart from her first appearance and holds her own with her fellow actors. Reno turns in as strong a performance as he has ever given, demonstrating why he is one of the few French leads to have made an equal impact in North America. Add to this an electrifying and intoxicating performance by the master of scene chewing, Gary Oldman, and a subtle and captivating turn by Danny Aiello as an Italian mobster, and this film is certainly worth the price of admission for the performances alone.""Leon"" is a picture perfect example of a film that expanded far beyond the confines of its genre. While being a wonderfully entertaining action film, it draws a strong dramatic narrative that is compelling and unforgettable, and certainly demands repeated viewing. It is a film that few can walk away from without the desire to turn right around and watch again.",Léon - The Professional

283,Baldrick44,Cool without being shallow,10,20 June 2006,"The Professional is one of those movies that you hang out for. It is truly that good. It revolves around Leon ( Jean Reno ), a 'cleaner' who, when filling out contracts on others, is watching Gene Kelly films or watering plants. His private life is one of total innocence, as opposed to his grisly occupation. This life is rudely disturbed however when his next door neighbour, Mathilda ( Natalie Portman ) comes under his guardianship after her family is slaughtered by one Norman Stansfield ( Gary Oldman ), a pill-popping, erratic, Beethoven connoisseur of a cop. He is the exact opposite of Leon; whereas Leon's a innocent in an evil profession, Stansfield has blood all over his hands in a legitimate one. Swearing revenge on Stansfield for the death of her little brother, Mathilda persuades Leon to help her obtain her goal, leading to a curious relationship between the two that sees them both embroiled on Stansfield's turf and sets up for an explosive finale.The Professional is a great movie because of the way it makes the audience think. It has all the action of a good Hollywood film, with all the quirks of a European film. It may not be ripping off a Fish Called Wanda, but it feels in a same vein of Hollywood shootouts and quirky characters. Reno is great as Leon, showing innocence at home and a sort of cold menace at work. Portman shows the acting talent that is still around today and their relationship, while hailed as controversial by many, could also be equated as two lonely people looking for comfort in someone. But it is Gary Oldman who truly makes this movie fantastic, playing a totally amoral character who seems to have no qualms in shooting at old ladies, while commenting on the finer points of classical music two minutes before. Even Johnny Depp would struggle finding this sort of menace out of a character while making him weirdly hilarious; it is truly his role and shows his versatility.The Professional is a near-flawless movie that never takes an easy road, nor paints things in black and white, and is all the better for it.",Léon - The Professional

At least I do. I have seen this film a few times already, and I chose to watch it again today because I knew my girlfriend would enjoy it also. She did, of course.Leon is an assassin, a hit-man if you will, and he works for a man named Tony, who is well known in the city. Leon does individual jobs for money from Tony, but Tony holds onto his money, and constantly tells Leon that he is like a bank, only better. Leon passes a girl named Matilda, who is smoking a cigarette. They become acquainted, and she tells him not to tell her father for the fear that she will be beaten. Later on, when she is out getting her family some groceries (and also some milk for Leon, to thank him for the hankie he gave her for her bloody nose), her family is all killed because of a mob being suspicious of drugs. When she comes back, she tries to pass her open apartment door as she sees her father lying dead on the floor, to go to Leon's apartment so that she will be let in, or else draw suspicion from the guard at the door. Leon lets her in to his apartment, to his world of assassination, and lets her in to his heart.This movie is a total package for 'movie freaks', contains mainly action and drama, and slight comedy.

287,jochemunlimited,A game changer for me,9,3 October 2021,"One of my favourite movies and I did not leave a review! I watched the movie many times, but I was also much younger. This movie made an impact for me. I was around 16 or 17 I think, I liked watched Jean-Claude van Damme movies for example and many other action movies.So let's start with the beginning, a family is being killed in an appartment. The woman shot in the bath made an impact on me. Maybe it represented the feeling of the scene. Because there was a corrupt cop with a drug addiction who was in a peaceful zen moment killing people. The actor is doing great as a very disturbed person! And there is also some humour in the scene. I have never seen anything like this.So you have Leon and Mathilda. Mathilda wants to be a hitman and she loves old man (she thinks). This is not another action hero girl, this is a disturbed child that comes in contact with a bit of disturbed man. The relationship and interaction between them is amazing, it is this movie that I started being a fan of Natalie Portman. They are acting very good. You see that Leon can learn from Mathilda, but that Mathilda also needs to learn a lot from Leon. Leon needs to deal with the 12 year old stubborn behaviour but also with himself. He needs to enjoy life more, but does he have any reason?Let's skip it to the end. The scene for me was a bit overdone with all those cops, but it was no problem for me. The ending also made an impact for me. All those guys for just one guy and he is managing to escape them! Oh wait... The bad guy wins... What? Mathilda is left with a plant...So when I saw this movie for the first time I was a bit in shock. I watched it a few times again to see more and more details and understanding the movie better and appreciate that this is art. And I am forgettig one thing: the music! That's making the movie complete. I am wondering why I am not giving this a 10... But I must be honest, I have not seen the movie for ages now, so I am not sure what I will think about it now. Maybe I must keep the memory in my head like it is now.But for me this was a game changer, my bar was set higher for next movies. Thanks!",Léon - The Professional
288,Watcher-37,Fantastic Film,10,23 August 1999,"I loved everything about this film. It kind of plays like a reverse Gloria, with the man protecting the girl this time.

She manages to convince him to teach her the business of cleaning so that she can avenge the death of her brother, the only member of the family she cared anything about. Gary Oldman, continuing his work as film's resident psychopath is the lead corrupt cop, and chews his scenes up and spits them back out for the viewer's entertainment. Jean Reno is convincing as the hitman Leon, a man a little slow of wit, but exceptional in his work. And last but certainly not least, Natalie Portman as Mathilda. What can you say but wow, what an impact she has in this film. A good thing since the plot centered on her.

289,jlacerra,A Great But Weird Movie,10,15 June 2003,"When I first saw this picture I was astonished by how good it is, and also by how weird it is (some might say surreal).  For Example:(And I hope none of these are SPOILERS):They seem to want you to think its New York, but it doesn't look or 'feel' like New York.It's implied that Leon is Italian, but he is obviously sooo French.$5,000 for a hit is ridiculously cheap.The sexual undercurrent between Leon and Matilda is hard to dismiss. (by the way, I've only seen this movie on Bravo, so I'm sure there were bigtime cuts; they have Oldman saying he's had enough of this ""Bull squash""!!)The issue of money brings up the whole Danny Aiello thing;  old pro Aiello plays his character excellently. But is Old Tony screwing Leon out of, a)the proper wages for his work, and b)the money he's ""holding""? Old Tony has never heard of the FDIC, claiming that banks always get robbed, but not Old Tony.The picture hits its low point with the pig oven-mit scene.  The rest is one wonderful roller-coaster rush to its fantastic (albeit inevitable) conclusion.    High marks to Reno, Aiello, Oldman, and especially Portman.  If there were a sequel, why not get Portman to play Matilda?",Léon - The Professional
290,Junker-2,"Good acting, bad acting, big plot holes...",6,20 December 2004,"It is a mystery to me why ""The Professional"" is rated so high here on the IMDb...#62 as I write this. To be sure, there is much to admire here. But for everything director Luc Besson gets right with this movie he seems to get something else quite terribly wrong.Let's start with the positive: Natalie Portman as Mathilda is a revelation here. Young, beautiful and very, very talented, it should come as no surprise after watching this movie why George Lucas wanted her to play a major role in his second ""Star Wars"" trilogy. And Jean Reno as Leon is her perfect counterpart. Reno underplays his role beautifully and the two stars develop a true screen chemistry.Oh, but now the negatives. Gary Oldman, normally a wonderful villain, is way, way over the top as the DEA agent Stanfield. He ""chews up the scenery"" to quote other reviewers I have read. (That's not a compliment.) And Oldman's lunatic rantings lead me to the main problem I have with the movie: Plot holes.In order to fully believe the events of this movie you must accept that Stanfield is at least somewhat capable of behaving in a normal manner in society. After all, he holds an important position in the DEA. And he must have a supervisor or two, doesn't he? Could the raving lunatic we see here really function in that role without raising a dozen red flags? I don't think so.Of course, Stanfield has a merry band of followers. Dozens, it seems. One has to wonder if every cop in the city is as corrupt as he is. How in the world do they burst into someone's apartment, kill his wife (in the bathtub!) as well as his teenage daughter and four year old son...again all without raising any red flags?And speaking of that pivotal scene, it is also hard for me to accept that Mathilda's father, knowing what is coming, would not have had his entire family out of that apartment by Noon.The biggest plot hole, however, is the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. As well acted as it is, the lone wolf hit-man deciding to ""adopt"" a 12 year old girl just does not ring true. It is far too clearly a mere plot device.While watching this movie I was often reminded of the film ""Taxi Driver"" which deals with many of the same themes. ""Taxi Driver"" is a movie that deserves a high ranking in the IMDB top 250. ""The Professional"" does not.",Léon - The Professional

The light from the world with Mathilda shone into his world, but at the last moment it tilted down and fell, forming a permanent regret. The beauty of this drama lies in a kind and soft heart under Leon's cold appearance, in that two people can be brave and pure but not at all for the sake of each other, and that the hope of happiness falls suddenly when it is about to be realized.",Léon - The Professional

""Individuals"" refers to the two main characters in the film, who confront an indifferent and distorted world. The scene in the city is a bit like being in a cage. Irregular, distorted and distorted urban composition can be seen everywhere, with the overall tone biased towards dark colors. Cities, tall buildings, these are the result of human development, but with them, in addition to advanced science and technology, but also breeding, spreading crime. The irony is that the police department, traditionally a symbol of justice and order, has become a source of evil and violence. The police station is also one of the tall buildings, the authority of the whole society, but has become one of the main positions of the evil world. The film expresses the director's indictment and distrust of the world and society.

296,Netscape_Navigator,"overrated, how is this better than Man on Fire?",5,18 December 2005,"I watched this under the recommendation that it was similar to Man on Fire (2004), but much, much, much better. Well it's nothing like Man on Fire, so I'll judge this movie as it stands on its own. It stands as well as any peg legged person would. The bond between Creasy and Pita was very believable, the bond between Leon and Mathilda is contrived and awkward. From the outset, I didn't buy that this little Mathilda girl has this burning passion and dedicated devotion to become a hit-man just like Leon. What little girl even thinks like that? Also, what makes her sooo interested in him anyway? I'm talking about before he rescued her, what was it about him that she was so attracted to? It makes no sense.Obviously if Mathilda didn't want to be a hit-man, we would have no movie. Had they justified this motivation in a more believable manner, I would've bought it. And no, her family being murdered (including her brother who she was close with) doesn't count. I don't buy ""becoming a hit-man"" as a believable emotional response for a 12 year old girl. If they wanted to make it realistic, they should've had her desire to be a hit-man be more of a passing interest, as sort of a passionate raw response to having her family murdered. A lot of kids show interest in whatever it is that is current in their minds at the time, but unless it's something that they are naturally interested in, or are forced to do, they probably won't follow through with the hard work and dedication it takes to succeed in some random craft thrown at them (and why should they, you think you can get a 12 year old girl to all of a sudden show daily dedication in say, becoming a car mechanic, without any persuasion to do so?) Here's what they should've done: After her family is killed, have her still want to exact revenge, but what should change is her character's desire to *continue* training to be a hit-man, because that single flaw is what throws this whole premise off the balcony. I would have her eventually try to give up on this idea after realizing what a dark world she's gotten herself into, only to have Leon not allow her back out of her commitment. The manner in which Leon reacts to this and the degree to which he goes to prevent her cop out would be determined by how you would want to portray his character. There could be many interesting possibilities with this sort of idea, by showing a realistic shades of grey character.One final thing, so many people said how Gary Oldman was so great in this, and squealing with delight about how his quirky performance was just so wonderful. The man's FACE bothered me the entire movie. The way he played that character was very annoying, not to mention unrealistic to the type of disposition a person that made it to his position would have.",Léon - The Professional

This movie is possibly Jean Reno's best performance. Gary Oldman plays the bad guy, But Reno is the slick fast killing, slick, hit-man, moving without a trace, killing without emotion.

298,advaitkamat,Engaging but surprisingly hollow.,6,13 November 2013,"How disappointing it is to watch a movie that promises so much but in the end, the product is eventually underwhelming, and your hope ruptures like a balloon when pricked. ""Leon : The Professional"" starts off rather well, builds it story through episodes of violence and cans of milk, but doesn't know what it wants when the action gets going. Leon (Jean Reno) is a quiet, reclusive hit-man living a discreet life in New York City. Methodical, smart and stern, he works assignments for an Italian mob boss, Tony (Danny Aiello). Leon has principles - he hardly ever watches television, always drinks only milk and takes good care of a potted plant which he labels his best friend. Leon's neighbor is Mathilda (Natalie Portman), a brash and bratty girl of twelve, who has a junkie for a father and stepmother, an impertinent stepsister and a four year-old brother, whom she loves. Her father (Michael Badalucco) steals some drugs a corrupt DEA agent, Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) left with him for safekeeping, Stansfield instructs him to return the dope by noon the next day, a warning which the junkie coolly ignores.The next day, Stansfield and his team storm the household and kill everyone they can find, including Mathilda's young brother. Traumatized and angry, she seeks lodging with Leon, the only other person whom she considers a friend. Though reluctant at first, Leon gradually eases in her company. Mathilda wants to learn how to kill, a task Leon grudgingly accepts. In the process, she develops feelings for him, which remain one-sided. As time passes, Mathilda becomes increasingly restless to avenge her brother's murder.Director Luc Besson sets the events in motion with a terrifically tense action sequence early on, a taster of what to expect later on when the plot gets lurid. The prefatory sequence introduces the protagonist in a way that it needed to, with a barging camera that captures the detailed action with curious fervor. The characters are meticulously written and a great deal of attention is paid to level them out, allow us to get familiar with them. In parts, I enjoyed the movie thoroughly, reveling in the little occasional doses of humor and heartbreak. Besson weaves the action with the drama skillfully, and though the film limps through many of the sequences, it's fantastically watchable. Boring, it is never. And the climax sequence, a great jolt of pure cinema, is masterfully directed. The biggest hitch with ""Leon : The Professional"" is that it is never the sum of its individual products. An oddly constructed assassin-actioner, there are long, yawning stretches of time when the plot hardly advances. It wants to be about its little protagonist but Besson resorts to not let Leon out of the sight. Which is why, I presume, the trivial romantic angle is introduced, a sub-plot which bears very little relevance to the actual story. And when it does get to its exceptional end, hobbles to it rather, it seems like a tediously-assembled downer. Shame.The entire cast is outstanding. Reno hands in a textured, peerless performance which is full of ferocity and feeling, a rarity. Oldman, whose character is dangerously stereotyped, steals the few scenes he has. The cocksure and amoral agent is a character we so often get to watch but Oldman puts a little spin on it and delivers an ace performance. The surprise package of the lot is young Portman, a brilliantly expressive, supremely confident Portman, who screams 'Oscar' all the way. I find it astonishing that a twelve year-old young actress is capable of pulling off something even forty year-old, experienced actors would sweat to clinch.""Leon : The Professional"" could've been something more than it is, had it paid a little more attention to its fundamental storyline and not what would please the viewers.

Trying to cope with that while being on the run by a hit-man who is saving her life, the bonding between the two is unlike anything you will get in most films out there, from any generation. From it's extremely drab look, to the creepy vibe Leon gives, even though you know his intentions are great, this is one film you surely shouldn't miss. In the end, this is one of the best films in this genre that I have ever seen. Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are phenomenal, the script is undeniably brilliant, and the score will have your heart racing, even in moments you would least expect.I highly recommend this film to fans and non-fans of this genre. ""Leon: The Professional"" is a brilliant picture.Leon: The Professional is a wonderful character study, enriched by outstanding performances, thrilling action, and a well-rounded script that gives the film an intriguing amount of depth.Luc Besson's original feels more like a journey than just a joy-buzzer jolt of action, and the deeper, braver, darker story he set out to tell - a fractured and fractious fairy tale. When people rave about ""The Professional,"" they mean ""Léon.""I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. Besson's skill with action is inventive and creative (and of course over the top). ---Yidioo",Léon - The Professional
300,Maz-hell,Powerful drama film,9,13 February 2019,"This was a powerful movie. Made in 1994, It tells the story of Mathilda and Leon, a mismatch made in heaven. She is the daughter no one likes or cares for in a family that is over disfunctional, whose family gets killed because daddy was an idiot and made Gary Oldman (Seriously, I love you Gary) get angry. Leon is a slow but solid hitman, so precise that no one can see or detect him before they are already dead.The chemestry was there, with intentional awkwardness making you feel weird watching the movie. Portman was (until George Lucas pretty much butchered her career) an emotional rollercoast that can really act. Hell, I almost cried with her in many ocasions. Of course, Jean Reno is a god, so I can't add a word.Now, the movie still suffers a couple of drawbacks, nothing mayor, but enough to stop it into being perfect: there is a mayor pothole when he killed the chinese, the music was not the most adequate and the movie feels really awkward in some set pieces in a very unintentional way. I know the original script was very much ""12 years old forces Reno"" but you could reduce the awkwardness. You still feel like that was there and it hurts.Still a magnificent movie. Would watch again.",Léon - The Professional
301,dragonshield,Simply an amazing movie,9,31 May 2007,"I had never seen this film before two days ago when I got my hands on it. I was very interested of it, so I was pretty much expecting a great movie experience. The movie tells about an Italian professional hit-man Léon who lives in peace and quiet with his plant. He doesn't have any friends besides Tony who hires him for hit-man jobs and that's pretty much what his life is; Nothing special, boring to be exact, besides the jobs he does. His neighbour is a drug dealer who's working with crooked DEA officers. This neighbour has a wife and three kids, and one of those kids is a 12 year old girl named Mathilda who Léon occasionally speaks to in the hall way. Mathilda's life is pretty much miserable, his father being a drug dealer who sometimes hits her and the rest of his family being just mean and ignorant besides his four year old little brother who is the only friend of her's. One day Mathilda leaves to the grocery store and in the meantime her whole family is killed by the DEA officers. When she comes back and walks along the hall way she sees her family's dead bodies and keeps on walking towards Léon's door. Léon lets her into his apartment and at the same time into his life as well.There's honestly so much more in the story, but I just don't want to give away any spoilers, as the movie's whole storyline is so brilliant. The story is very well written by Luc Besson who has also directed the movie. It's really more than just an action movie, there's so much drama in it as well. An odd relationship forms between Léon and Mathilda in a way that's just so beautiful. The whole build up of it, the progression and forming of this odd friendship is so compelling with its mixtures of great humour and beautiful drama. The movie reminds a lot of ""The Fifth Element"", which is also a great film but still nothing near this movie. Both movies are from the same director and writer after all, and the music is also almost identical in both of the movies as well. Composed by Eric Serra it gives more of that Luc Besson -edge for the movies he does. It's dark and it's there for building up the tension. The cinematography is also almost identical in both of the movies, quick and swift camera movements and humorous close-ups of characters on the screen. I guess that is Luc Besson's vision and it also works really well, especially when it comes to movies like these. All in all, ""Léon"" and ""The Fifth Element"" could be described as brothers, only that the stories are completely different. ""Léon"" just tends to go a bit deeper, having so much more depth in the story.To me the cast was brilliant and the acting was superb. Léon is played by the always enjoyable Jean Reno, who I've never really seen in a better role than in the role Léon and to be honest it's his best role performance yet to date as well. Although really being french, playing an Italian hit-man really suits him and he really is the whole character with his essence. Mathilda is played by the brilliant Natalie Portman and I was so surprised and amazed of the fact that she was a superb actress even back when she was only 12 years old! The acting she does is once again so pure and the work between her and Reno is really admirable, they really have this connection together and the dialogue between the characters just shines with its wit and the even better acting. Gary Oldman as the head DEA officer Stansfield is one of the most perfect villains I've ever seen on screen, giving that mad look and having a madness inside him. He just can look so intimidating that it almost scares me. And then there's last but not the least Danny Aiello as Tony, who's performance isn't particularly phenomenal, but he sure is perfect for the role.All in all ""Léon"" offers you a fantastic movie experience. It has action, it has drama and it also has a bit romance in it too, in an odd but a beautiful way. Even when Léon is a hit-man, the viewer does feel sympathy for him, which is caused by the genius character writing. This is an excellent movie and it is not praised for nothing. When the magnificent action scenes take part you realize saying two words to yourself; ""Yeah.."" continued by "".. Awesome"" I guess the movie is aimed more for the male audience, but I think the female ones will be satisfied as well. The movie has that famous man power at its best and despite the fact that Jean Reno's character is a bit stereotypical as a hit-man, the character itself has more than that in it, it has depth and it has originality, a simple man who's just really seeking for approval and a true friend. ""Léon"" is a movie to watch without a doubt, a definite recommendation for everyone, especially for the male audience who are looking for action and thrill in a very successful package.",Léon - The Professional
302,burnzyburns,Six stars out of ten,6,29 May 2021,"To me, it's controversial how this movie has such a high rating and praise. Understandably, I watched this thinking I was going into this cinematic masterpiece and I was dammed that I didn't see it, but that is untrue; it's the opposite. I liked the acting but no one really shines in their roles. I didn't like the plot because it's terribly predictable. If there is a movie that should hold the title Overrated and Average then that belongs here. Leon The Professional isn't a bad movie, let me clarify, it's not even close of being dreadful, I just don't understand how we're giving this an 8/10 or higher. I truly don't understand. There are so many movies out there that are like this told in similar styles yet were here talking about Leon like it's a different breed.6/10.",Léon - The Professional
303,smithpaulusmc,Dying For A Sequel,9,27 January 2020,"Natalie Portman's breakout role as 13-year-old orphan Mathilda in Luc Besson's Léon: The Professional is one for the history books. Alongside film icons Gary Oldman, who plays a crooked detective, and Jean Reno, the Italian assassin who rescues Mathilda after her parent's death, Portman and crew deliver a powerful performance that calls to question the ambiguity of morality.
Léon: The Professional is more than a coming of age film. Although it spends most of its time detailing the effects urban crime can have on a young teenager, it takes several stops to unpack the kindness known even among stereotypical villains. Everything seems backward in Léon: The Professional. The cops are the bad guys, the hitman is a savior, and the child acts more like an adult than anyone else.
There is a lot to like about Léon: The Professional. The score is modern for its era, even featuring Sting's song ""Shape of My Heart"" which has a guitar melody many modern viewers will recognize from Juice Wrld's song ""Lucid Dreams."" The camera work is also sound, featuring ingenious POV shots that stick the viewer into the character's headspace. If the technical beauty of the film alone doesn't grab you, the cast's exceptional performance will. Detective Stansfield is perhaps Gary Oldman's most recognizable role. Natalie Portman appears seasoned in her execution, driving a noticeable wedge in between her and other similar aged actors' abilities.
Léon: The Professional is not a film to miss. It deals in heavy material like corruption, drug use, murder, and love across age barriers without beating the audience over the head. Without a doubt, It should reside on every film lover's top 250 list.",Léon - The Professional

305,like_cc,Gentle killer,9,20 March 2020,"The film is full of artistic atmosphere, and even the scene of the killing is as unique and beautiful as the artwork. The director expressed more criticism of some ugly things in life in reality. In addition, it also talks about the friendship between strangers and the spirit of devotion to love.There is real danger and drama throughout the film, yet it never becomes merely an action film - the characters are too significant for that. I love to appreciate the movie that people have thought great and classic. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is the themeof this film. The director Luc Besson, as always, both makes the film look beautiful and builds plenty of atmospheres into it. He is clever at directing the figures and the psychology. Nobody can make more success than him, that's why I appreciate him.
This is a wonderful film. The story, which at first glance is unrealistic and silly, actually becomes gripping and emotional in the hands of the skilled Jean Reno and that little girl. The characters are sympathetic and cute, and one is touched by the depthof the relationship between Leon and Mathilda. The character of their enemy, Norman Stansfield, is scary and insane.
The story tells us that Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl. She has a misery life. Her father is involved in handling drugs for a crooked cop called Norman Stansfield One day, Mathilda encounters Leon (acted by Jean Reno), professional hitman, the little girl is out shopping for Leon when Stansfield kills the rest of her family, and fortunately she takes shelter in Leon's house, .It is that Matilda went straight to Leon's when she saw her family was killed.It is thatLeon saw in the keyhole that Matilda",Léon - The Professional

307,vocklabruck,Nikita + Pretty baby = What a let-down!,2,3 December 2006,"Be aware. This movie is NOT action, this movie is more drama than anything else. Sorry but I can't help to see the similarities with these movies I am mentioning. Of course the parallel with Nikita is because it is the same director, but the story in general is quite similar too! Add to this the little girl characterization of Pretty Baby by Malle. Anyway, I have to say that I did not watch the original version of The Professional, I have just seen this one by Besson.--- Spoilers ---The first thing I want to say is... do these people know they are dealing with children? How the hell they make this 11 y.o. girl smoke and put her in other scenes learning about weapons, etc? For heaven sake! This is why this movie has a lot of Pretty Baby. In Pretty Baby Brooke Shields learned about prostitution and wanted to be a whore, now in Leon Natalie Portman learned about weapons and wanted to be a ""cleaner"". I make the question again... Do these people realize that they are dealing with children, and that somehow this kind of things affect the little actor psyche??? Because of this... I found most time of this movie very disgusting! It was very hard to stay in front on the screen. I like to study English with movies and that is the only reason I kept watching this garbage. I rented this one and well... and had to watch it, at least to learn English.This movie was extremely violent without reason, had many plot holes and impossible things... I mean things no plausible at all.First... I understand the girl had a bad childhood but she wanting to be a killer is not convincing, even with her brother died, an 11 y.o. girl does not have that kind of feelings and wants to murder people.Second, I do not understand why so many people say in their comments that Jean Reno character is a good guy... Do you think a good person would say to a little girl that life is ""always like this"" when she ask if it is always so hard??? Even if the life is so hard, you would never paint it in black for a little girl, man! Do you think a good person would teach a little girl how to use a long-distance rifle to kill someone even if she insisted with the matter? And in fact, a good person would have not hesitated to open the door when she was crying for help.Third: DEA agents leader is a junky??? Hahahaha... This was really laughable. How could I guy like that be in the force? If we have that kind of policemen in US we are in GREAT TROUBLES, bro!Fourth: How can a baby girl go into that high security building without problems, and MORE... how can a single guy breaks into the same building some minutes later shooting everyone without any problems either?Fifth: Jean Reno character is a Terminator model T-101. Nothing beats him. They brought 500 SWATs and no-one can scratch him...Also I found very disturbing this relationship between Reno and Portman, she is in love just like Shields in Pretty Baby, I can understand that, girls that age fall in love easily, but that means you can make a movie and insinuate they sleep together or something? OK, do it, make the movie, but then do not make a scandal when something like that happens in the real world!I will not continue because this movie made me sick... but wait, somehow the final is good and the plant finale scene is really moving. After all, the girl will have a second chance in life... again, just like Pretty Baby finale.Hard childhood... and they want to show it cruelly. But I don't think it is good to use children for this, in this explicit way.",Léon - The Professional

Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman are all brilliant in this wonderful triangle.Is there a role that Gary Oldman cannot pull off with style? Even in his poorer films such as LOST IN SPACE, he is still able to bring it to a watchable level. This is definetly in my top 5 favourite Gary Oldman films.I found the love bit (what Mathilde feels for Leon) a bit dodgy but hey the girl is 12- her emotions were running wild!

311,dreamingescapist,"Is life always this hard, or is it just when you're a kid?",9,27 July 2019,"'Leon' is a movie that is much less controversial than it is said. I believe that this is thanks to the good writing, character development, and single-mindedness of a general film viewer/critic, although a wider audience gave much more love to the film than the critics. There is nothing lolitaesque in 'Leon'. We all know that most young girls have some sort of crush into older men. But thanks to the brilliant performance of Jean Reno (and of course young Natalie Portman as Mathilda), and subtle writing, the relationship between the two main heroes is purely mentor-apprentice. Besides the 'love story', it is also a classic revenge tale and coming of age story. There is nice subtle morale there how sometimes it is best to leave the immediate retaliation onto the hold. Sometimes it is better to wait for justice to take longer. It might hit harder.",Léon - The Professional

313,someokiedude,"""This is...from...Mathilda.""",10,29 May 2020,"Strange...that's the first word that comes to mind when discussing this film. It is reminiscent of the action thrillers of the 70s, I am particularly reminded of the original The Mechanic with Charles Bronson, both are about the strange relationships between a reluctant hitman and his eager protege. Though unlike The Mechanic, there is a strange sweetness to the core relationship of the film.Leon is often described as a child stuck in a man's body, and one wouldn't be wrong in describing him as such. Leon, despite being a skilled contract killer, has a rather naive and child like enjoyment for the little things in life. His love for Mathilda is not a perverse one, but rather a deep, emotional love that comes from something that is beyond sex or any type of physical intimacy. The chemistry between Jean Reno and a young Natalie Portman is impeccable, there is a sensitivity in their relationship while simultaneously having an uncomfortable, one sided, sexual tension. Portman, despite only being 13 at the time of filming, gives a nuanced and complex performance. It's a performance that gives a taste of what Portman would later bring to her future career. She brings a maturity and even a sense of world weariness to her role, almost as if she is a full grown woman in a young girl's body, in stark contrast with the child like Leon.Another aspect of the film that steals the show is Gary Oldman as Norman Stansfield, which I still believe to be Oldman's finest role to date. Stansfield is almost comical in his approach, there's also a charisma and a glamour to his character that is reminiscent of Alex DeLarge, but also the mania of Tony Montana and Nicholson's Joker. Oldman certainly wears his influences on his sleeve, but allows himself to create a new character from them and not just doing a mere impression of those characters. Oldman has the difficult challenge of attempting to 'lose his cool' without becoming unintentionally funny. It's almost funny, but there is that creepiness to his character to where he becomes disturbing. It's simply one of the creepiest performances ever put to film.Despite the acting and writing being exceptionally strong, the film's other strongest aspect is the slick direction from Besson, as well as the action scenes, which I still find to be some of the best ever put to film. They are fast, electric, and full of energy, but never self-indulgent or silly. The violence has a point, as most good examples of violence being used in film tend to have.Unfortunately, Besson never again captured the passion and sensitivity that made this film so compelling. It makes me ask myself: what the hell happened to the man who directed Leon, and when will he direct another film?",Léon - The Professional

It's very well put together with great characters and storyline. It's got a great atmosphere and it's great at building tension. Jean Reno is perfectly cast as Leon and this is definitely his best role. The same can be said for Natalie Portman, as far as I'm concerned this is still her best role.

315,judemcrobbie,Foreign Indie-ness crossed with American blockbuster,10,10 February 2021,"Leon is a masterclass in how to write a terrifying protagonist. The first scene exemplifies this:
How we don't see him until the end creates a sense of dread felt unlike any other movie. This is executed in the fear from dialogue and acting from the whole cast.
The use of lighting, or lack of, and compartmentalisation of information scared us as well as the antagonist.
This scene revolutionised fearmongering for a protagonist, from Batman to John Wick.
The way Besson creates the likeable nature is so simple. Merely by using the youthful connotations of milk and writing a completely unlikeable antagonist for the scene.
The opening and final acts are sublime but the second act let's it down just a bit. Not even that the second act is bad, but the opening and final act are so good comparatively not up to scratch.
Jean Reno is so good. He creates the caring parent idea with almost being friends with Mathilda.
Gary Oldman is so good. The nutter archetype is common but Standfield is layered and Oldman shows this perfectly.
Natalie Portman, despite being 12-13, plays her role showing the child who had been forced to grow up to fast so wellThe nature of the foreign, indie-like director combined with American blockbuster for an overall brilliant, if not a little weird viewing experience.",Léon - The Professional
316,Fredichi,Favorite Luc Besson film.,10,17 July 2000,"This is one of my favorite movies and my favorite Luc Besson film.
Fifth Element is really good but it has some major flaws (Namely Chris Tucker's character), Big Blue is beautiful but Rosanna Arquette is obnoxious and there isn't much to it, La Femme Nikita is great but it is really hard to like the main character, The Messenger is just a bad movie (All because of Milla Jovovich's awful performance), Subway was a little too abstract to be great, I haven't seen Le Dernier Combat (Although I would really like to get a copy of it. Hopefully with the release of Big Blue, Subway and the uncut version of Leon it will be possible to see it soon).Professional- It takes multiple viewings to really appreciate it's subtleties, which most people would deny it has. But once you get past the explosive action, which apon multiple viewings you realize there really isn't much action you'll see that it is mostly about the relationship between Leon and Matilda.And this is where the subtleties come into play. So I suggest watching it a few more times to appreciate just how well-crafted and well-played these characters are.Jean Reno is perfect in this film and Natalie Portman is so good it's scary. (Considering she's so young)Gary Oldman is of course Gary Oldman. He's ferociously great as the over the top crooked cop.Danny Aiello is good as Leon's sort of slimey boss.Just a great original story, great acting, and great action.And it doesn't have the cheesey happy ending that pollutes most movies now.It's not the best movie in the world but for the reasons above and some other unknown reasons it has become one of my favorites. I'm waiting in great anticipation and slight frustration for the un-cut DVD out in August. Great anticipation: the extra 24 minutes. Frustration: I already own the US version on DVD and I don't like having to buy another. They do this on purpose and I think it's really shady of them to not tell you that another version is coming out when they release the original. Although this did come out on DVD a while ago and they probably didn't know they would release another version.But judging by how the uncut version is a best-seller already and isn't coming out till August 15th.

317,Aphex97,Amazing....,10,19 May 2001,"This movie holds a special place in my heart. There is just something about it that makes me love it so. Maybe the gripping story or the wonderfully complex characters or the beautifully choreographed action sequences. Its a rare combination of action & drama and death & love that gives this movie a unique soul as it deals essentially with the good and evil of the human heart. The depth of the characters created by Besson is wonderful.First, there is the foreign Leon, the lead actor played expertly by Jean Reno. A deadly assassin, a loving protector, vicious cold-blooded killer, awkward quiet man. His paradoxes make him interesting and also makes the viewer realize that he is not good nor evil but human, which is always somewhere in the gray.The troubled Matilda from a broken home is played perfectly by a very young Natalie Portman. Her character struggles with her feelings of conflicting love & hatred for her slain family. She wants to be evil, she wants to kill but is still a child dealing with confusing ideas about love and death. Her strong desire for revenge is eventually undermined by her innocence.
Gary Oldman's over-the-top performance steals the show though as the crooked cop. Truly the only evil character in the movie, he is thoroughly menacing. Several great supporting roles (Danny Aiello and others) are also put in. The powerful action sequences are smooth, exciting, and interesting. Directing is top notch. High production values are obvious throughout.FINAL RATING: 10/10 One of my favorite movies and one of only five movies I have given imdb's highest rating.

She was so terrific in this! I was astounded by her ability - especially the scene where she walks down the hall past her apartment door to discover her family was murdered with the Perpetrators still inside. She keeps walking, trying not to show any emotion to give away the fact that she lives there as there's a man standing outside sort of 'guarding' the place. She goes to her neighbor's door and starts knocking. Tears are streaming down her cheeks and she has a look of horror and desperation on her face as she whispers, ""Open the door, please. Please open the door!"" over and over. I almost started crying for her. She is truly a fantastic actress. And to think she did this at the age of 12-13! The whole movie was just packed full of incredible scenes such as this. Another scene that made my heart melt was the scene where she tries to explain to Léon  how she knows that she's in love with him: ""I have this warm feeling in my stomach. There was a knot there before but now it's gone."" And the scene where she dresses up as Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Chaplin and Gene Kelly. She was so adorable singing and acting. ""a mustache."" she says trying to look serious and melancholy like Chaplin.Reno was very good as well. I never really thought too much of him before (neither liked him nor disliked him). This movie shows that he really has a great talent.What probably amazed me the most about this was that Luc Besson both wrote it and directed it. Very well done. I hope he makes more like this one!

324,DaveDiggler,"A Shallow, Bloated, Predictable Messianic Film",4,14 May 2008,"""Leon: The Professional"" is about a love story intertwined with some ridiculous shootouts. The shootouts are unimaginative and plain stupid with the 1.9 million bullets fired at Leon, with three hitting, then Leon' disappearing acts, where he goes from the ceiling; to the hallway; to the bathroom, then, directly behind the guy he's going to kill, and he does it just like a professional... or a magician. One of the worst parts of the action scenes, especially at the end, is when everything is predictable about 30 seconds before it happens. That's the worst kind of predictability. Where you just find out what's going to happen before it does, because when this thrilling sequence happens- that you've been waiting for 30 seconds- it ends up not being so thrilling, and instead, becomes worthless and terribly ineffective. ""The Professional"" is flat. The love story involves Mathilda (Natalie Portman) and Leon (Jean Reno). Portman is twelve and Leon is old like 40. Don't be fooled, though, they love each other, but their relationship is strictly platonic. Even though Mathilda is much wiser beyond her years and ready for a sexual relationship, Leon is not, but he is tempted. Besson uses several shots throughout the film that places our eyes directly on the twelve-year-old's body. We get the feeling she's ready for it and that Leon want's it, but like Leon, Besson is tempting us because Leon is tempted. He shows her caressing her stomach, or getting out of bed with a shot directly on her underwear as she walks to the kitchen. Intriguing stuff expect she's twelve. What's the point of using a twelve-year-old here? I have no idea. Is it ridiculous and over-the-top? Of course it is and maybe that's the reason. Everything else is so stupid and over-the-top it's almost unwatchable and get's really annoying so why not put a twelve- year-old and 40-something in the middle of a weird love story that doesn't make any sense or have any purpose in a film such as this? Even the action is annoying. When it's not annoying it's boring. It's some of the stupidest stuff you'll ever see. It's unintelligent and plain stupid. The director has Leon stand behind a wall, a bunch of bullets go flying through the wall, and Leon is perfectly okay. Better yet, he's standing behind the people who are shooting at the wall he standing behind, and, then he kills them... all of them... in seconds. Wow. That's impressive stuff (sarcasm). Leon sleeps on a chair with sunglasses and a gun not too far away. His best friend is a plant. It doesn't ask questions and Leon likes that. He drinks a glass of milk by the quart; never the gallon. Oh, the excitement!!!! Leon has it all. The best thing that came out of this steaming pile of garbage is Gary Oldman. Like everything else, his character is over-the-top, but he seems to be the only that embraces it and goes with it. He is so good as the crazy, classical music loving, DEA agent that's so corrupt he loves taking lives. He actually, loves it. That's insane, right? Completely unfathomable? That's right, it is, but Oldman seems to be the only one in this that takes this film for what it is. Everyone else, Besson the worst, acts as if this is somehow plausible. That's when action films like this can't be enjoyable. When the directors know, the actors know, the writers know, and the audiences know this is all over-the-top and all about action, action, and more action is when films such as ""Leon"" are successful. Not like this, though. Not only are the action sequence poorly done, but the stereotypes of cops left and right with their minds on women, or family problems, or the they're just too stupid to do their job is not only ridiculous but tired and stereotypical and unimaginative. Besson does his best to make this feel anything but European. Reno is supposed to be Italian, see the casting director for that screw up, and Tony (Danny Aiello) is an Italian store-owner who does nothing but order people to be killed- And he has Leon kill a lot of people. Why? Who knows? Besson doesn't understand that's the good stuff. Anyone can make a movie about someone killing someone. Anyone. Tony has a drug ring, but we don't have a clue what it's about, or who it evolves, or where it comes from or anything. The worst part about Aiello's performance is that he thinks this is going to be the 90s version of, ""The Godfather."" Yeah, not working here, leave it to Brando and Pacino to pull off the real Mob Boss performances in real Mob movies. ""The Last Don"" didn't do it either. Try reading a script with some depth to it. This takes place in New York City, but you'll get the feeling it takes place in Europe with stupid American's that keep popping up and doing stupid things. It doesn't have much to say about anything. It wants to be bold and outgoing and push the envelope in regards to teens and middle aged men hooking up, but nothing in this film works. The more you think about it, the more you'll be able to pick apart this terribly flawed, substance-less action piece apart. As for the relationship between the forty-year-old and the twelve-year-old? What does it say? Not a whole lot other than love can actually make you happy, but when you're Leon, that doesn't last long and that, too, is predictable. This is simply terrible film-making that also looks outdated.",Léon - The Professional

328,jzathajenious,"a great, if overrated movie. Portman is fantastic.",8,27 March 2010,"Leon is a great action movie, that much is unarguable. the action set pieces are handled with great aplomb by Luc Besson, who certainly has shown with previous films that he can create a beautiful film visually, especially with action scenes. And yet Leon is also a great coming of age tale, with Natalie Portman putting in a great performance in a difficult role that would be above the ability of many young actresses.As much as i really like Jean Reno, he is not a nuanced actor. he is likable, charming in a dumb sort of way, but subtlety isn't his forte. good thing Leon is required to speak little, and basically maintain a gruff exterior and stoic facial expression the entirety of the movie...seriously, his beloved pot plant is more expressive (ok thats a tad harsh, i know). it seems besson tried to inject some quirkiness into the character (his best friend is a pot plant, he seems to exist purely on a diet of milk, he likes gene kelly etc) in order to make him more interesting an unique, but these traits seemed tacked on.Then we go to the other end of the spectrum with Gary oldman's performance....haha, i mean WOW....great actor and I'm a fan of his overall body of work, but he so completely overacts and chews up the scenery every time he's on screen, it severely dampens my enthusiasm for the movie. every bit of body language, every word that he screeches, just sets my teeth on edge. just taking a pill (supposedly to curb his psychotic tendencies? hmm, maybe up the dosage...) involves shaking the little capsule tin up to his ear (???) then swallowing the pill, and having a full body convulsion, neck twisting while he groans loudly...i mean, a simple bodily function turns into a grand opera in oldman's hands, its ridiculous.This ridiculousness in the acting also extends to the story, which in some moments just made me shake my head in disbelief. the climactic action scene, where it must be close to 100 swat team are trying to storm an apartment to kill one man, (oh, and using rocket launchers for gods sake) is so over the top it robs the scene of any true tension, as its all so unrealistic. there are a multitude of such stupid, unrealistic moments that i could list at least another 10 without thinking about it. anyway, the movie has some serious flaws, i think I've made that pretty clear by now.But the Pro's do outweigh the Con's. as mentioned before Portman made the world sit up and take notice with her performance here.Between Reno's stonefaced acting, and Oldman's histrionics, sits a balanced, mature depiction of a girl on the cusp of puberty. Portman is magnetic and you cant help but fall in love with her like Leon does. So where do i sit with the whole age gap thing? to be honest its never really bothered me, bloody oldmans acting and the stories ridiculousness have always been my gripes with the movie. Portman and Reno certainly have a chemistry that works on screen, their scenes together are among the best, as their relationship grows from a father/daughter relationship to something deeper.And as mentioned before, Besson is a brilliant visual artist, no denying that. for all the weakness of the story, the visual beauty carries the film for all its 2+ hr length. Its just a shame that the films acting and plot leave me almost laughing in disbelief at its ridiculousness. Nevertheless, id give it a 7 out of 10, as its entertaining and re-watchable.",Léon - The Professional
329,panchodh_12,"It's like Amelie, Lolita and The Usual Suspects clumped together",9,19 October 2014,"It's like Amelie because of the 90s aura, because of the beautiful camera shots filmed in an old New York apartment that could also perfectly be in Paris, because of the colour palette used by the director, because of the amazing, memorable quotes worth keeping, because of Natalie Portman's haircut, because of the way each character is immensely unique, irreplaceable.It's like Lolita because, well, that's kinda obvious. In a way, this movie is all about Natalie Portman's beautiful youth, is all about the perturbing situation in which Mathilda and León are in, the stark contrast between Natlie Portman looking like a child but acting like a woman and Jean Reno looking like a grown-up, professional killer but acting like a child. Antagonisms are all around Mathilda and Leóns relationship: she's a child, he's a grown up; he's the teacher when it comes to killing, but then he needs her to fill the check-in forms of the hotel because he doesn't know how to read. She can convincingly imitate Marilyn Monroe, but he doesn't even know who that is. In a way, it can be summed up when they say:Léon: You need some time to grow up a little. Mathilda: I finished growing up, Léon. I just get older. Léon: For me it's the opposite. I'm old enough. I need time to grow up. Then it's also like The Usual Suspect, because of how in the surface it just looks like another 90s gang movie, with drug dealing, corrupt cops and impressive scenes of blowing up buildings. But as soon as you step into it, you find an immensely rich plot, with unique characters and incredibly good acting: Jean Reno achieves an impressive amount of expression given his character's few lines. Natlie Portman is just perturbingly beautiful, and it's just amazing how she could pull out that acting with only 11. Though the one who really steals the show is Gary Oldman, my God what a memorable character. Every word he pulls out of his mouth is a memorable quote, and it even makes you forget that in reality he's a Brit.But in what this movie stands out in particular is the soundtrack. Bloddy hell, what an amazing score! The way the instrumental music is used is just sublime: all the guitars, pianos, violins and even bandoneons fit perfectly with the scenes, even if, in principle, they shouldn't. Why would a bandoneon playing a tango should fit in the scene in which an 11-year-old girl learns to use a gun from a 40-year-old professional killer, in the rooftop of some New York building?

This unorthodox relationship creates an abundance of emotionally intense scenes throughout the film, notably the excellent finale.

333,blindredemption,Awesome character driven piece of cinema,8,21 February 2008,"I had seen this movie a few years ago on t.v and thought it was certainly a good movie, but you know how t.v treats movies with editing. I had the feeling I was missing out. I picked a copy of this up at a store nearby and put it in my DVD player. It's still in there. First of all Jean Reno as the character Leon is extremely subtle, nervous, and somewhat unsure in anything other than his job as a ""cleaner"" (In a good way). He hardly ever knows how to portray his emotions. In the scene where he asks Tony if he could give some of his money to someone to ""Help out"" is the perfect example.Although Leon is unsure about his emotions, he comes out of his emotional shell at times with the help of Natalie Portman's character Mathilda. Mathilda is a 12 year old girl who's family has been killed, and looks to Leon as comfort. All of the scenes between these two are one of the main reasons to see this movie. The Water fight scene is a good one. And of course there is Gary Oldman who plays the crooked, murdering, classical loving DEA officer that kills Mathilda's family. He kicks so much ass it's sickening. When he blasts open the door to Mathilda's home with the shotgun is just awesome. As evil and crooked as he is, he also seems to be broken and be battling his own demons(refer to his little pill things). Also he gives an Oscar worthy talk with Natalie Portman in a men's room.

334,jb0579,"Masterpiece you say? No, but Close.",9,17 February 2015,"I won't bore you with a long plot synopsis, just to say that Reno plays Leon, a contract killer who informally adopts Matilda (Portman), a young girl with no place to go and fortuitously becomes aguainted with Leon the ""cleaner. Matilda becomes bent on avenging her family's murder, particularly that of her innocent little brother (the rest of the family is either abusive or uninteresting to her). Oldman's character as a corrupt cop becomes the object of her ire, and with help from a reluctant Leon the two set out to settle the score. What I will say is that I was BLOWN AWAY with the fact that, for all intents and purposes, this was the first big screen job for Portman, who was fragile, tough as nails, timid, bold, nervous, and even provocative - all at the same time. Oldman is just plain Gary Oldman. Effortless, believable, awesome as always, and charming even though his villainous role demands he not be, and you can't HELP but to fall in love with Jean Reno, who steals EVERYTHING he does. The beginning of the movie? Riveting. The middle? Absolutely keeps your attention: a perfect....PERFECT mix of tension and comic relief (which by the way is why I pan a lot of movies. In EVERY real life situation there's at least SOMETHING funny). The movie is at times intense and at times tender enough to evoke tears, if you are prone to that sort of thing. In my reviews I always add "" Scenes to Watch For""..... in this movie: when Portman (Matilda) is desperately knocking on Reno's (Leon's) door for reasons that will become obvious to you, watch her performance there, and the use of light on her face when the door opens but the viewer can't see it....genius direction and use of light. Another scene: the comic relief every time you see them march up the street carrying a plant for, again, reasons that will become obvious to you.

I found it touching that a hit-man could find it in his heart to make room for an abused, lost little girl, after her whole family was shot to death by the great GARY OLDMAN. I am very proud of Gary because he did such a wonderful job portraying the drug addicted chief of police who loved to kill those who valued life. What a wicked character, and how extraordinary his acting skills are. Natalie was great in this film, and she was a mere child. Some people may think that a hit man would never come to the rescue of a child especially if she is not a relative, but that's the great lesson of this story. Jean's character, Leon, has the ability to shoot anyone for money, anyone that is except for women and children, and that, I find was a good twist. It was best said in the classic story ""BEOWULF.""

Starting with the acting, Jean Reno aced his performance and really did portray the 'cleaner' profession, i really do wish all films based around hit-men could be like this, i really do. The writing, it sustained a brisk pace throughout the movie and plotted twists and turns in different places creating this fantastic film. But there is one character who i find unusually disturbing and this was Matilda played by Natalie Portman, Matilda was weird, disturbing and a little bit looney, but on the other hand she is still a innocent kid who loves to copycat and play games, yet she acts like an adult to lure Leon into her trap where who knows what would have happened. Matilda disturbed me yet showed me the innocence of childhood and that is exactly what a charterer like her should do, divide your opinion and question their every move. Then there is Gary Oldman, and he honestly was more disturbing, you could see the insanity in his eyes, yet he could be disturbingly calm or the complete opposite and we never actually get to know his character which i love to see, every film needs a character like this, i think it just keeps the audience on the edge of their seat just connecting the dots.

Leon and Mathilda however very peculiar and odd but one of the very lovable and sensitive lead pair ever created.the character of Mathilda was of emotionally damaged 13 year old girl who behave like a grown up mature girl,do smoking,filled with revenge and love and above all she is innocent and cute.her feelings can be easily understand by looking into her dysfunctional family.She was neglected by her father,elder sister and mother and due to her protective feelings towards her younger brother,she grown herself mentally or we can say she lost her childhood to become habitual with her harshful life.the dialogs of Mathilda was very mature but you also get sympathized with her and also laugh on her innocence and her naive feelings.Her feelings towards Leon can be easily understood as he saved her and she wanted her revenge through Leon.the character of Mathilda played by very talented Natalie portman she give best performance of her career in her debut.the protagonist Leon is also very complex and hard to understand because instead of being a professional killer, he is very good hearted and sensitive.jean reno played the character of Leon and he did very astonishing job because it was very difficult for audience to grew sympathy for a man whose profession is killing people and jean reno successfully accomplished this.Leon is one of all time favorite character for me and one of my favorite line from a movie ""no women no kids"".the feelings and love of Leon towards Mathilda was totally platonic and nothing was immoral and absurd in it.another character of the movie who was highly influencing and impactful was of Stanfield who is the antagonist of movie and was portrayed by Gary old man.you will always feel fear and shivering when he come on screen,a total psychopath,i wondered how did he passed the medical test for being a police officer.you will hate him as much as you never hated anyone before.also the characters of tony,malky,Mathilda's family and even every small roles in movie were very beautifully and perfectly portrayed.luc besson directed the movie very well,every thing was perfect with movie.the intensity and tension created during many scenes was unbearable and thrilled us from inside.scenes when Standford murdered the family,the sniper scene at roof,or the shootout scenes at beginning and ending of movie,the scene when Mathilda tried to shoot herself were very thrilling and almost stop my breathing. music of the movie composed by Eric Serra was very pleasant and played very important role for making movie more involving and touching for us.i really get disappointed when i saw that Leon was not even nominated for any award.i believe that movie should have been nominated for academy for best movie,best director (luc besson)best leading actor(jean reno),actress(Natalie portman) and also for supporting actor(Gary old man) ,soundtrack(eric Serra).it was very unfortunate that movie remained unnoticed due to low publicity among movies like pulp fiction,Forrest gump and the shawshank redemption which was released during the same year of 1994.this movie has every potential to stand along with these movies.",Léon - The Professional

Take just about any film in the Top 250, and I daresay that very, very few will have this massive a gap of opinion between that of the ""top 1000 voters"" (7.6 average) and the viewership at large (8.3 average).  And there's a very good reason for this; an experienced viewer can separate the virtues from the vices of this film, and this one is too long on the vices.  The set-up is great: merciless hitman is humanized, serves as protector and guide to young girl.  This *could* have been a great movie had it not fallen so flat in how it's executed.  Maybe it's something about kid actors, but the scenes where Mathilda (Portman, who shows promising signs of her deficiences as older actress) has anything to say draaaaaag on and on.  For any number of reasons you can imagine, the dialogue is cause for nervous fidgeting.  The attempts at humor make you wince.  The attempts at profundity will make you laugh.  The intriguing plot degenerates into artificial, sometimes preposterous, scenarios.  The highlight of the film?  Gary Oldman as the villain.  That should tell you something right there.  His flailing and jerking around in the police restroom was the most enjoyable moment of the movie.  Maybe Oldman himself realized that this movie wasn't to be taken all too seriously.  I wouldn't recommend the DVD version to anyone, as it makes the experience a grueling one.  A ridiculous restaurant sequence, among other things, is removed for the American release.

But not only does Besson make it work, he makes it insanely cool. The action sequences are very reminiscent of his 1990 film Nikita in their brutality but have been ramped up a gear. But for all the guns and bangs, it's the human scenes that sets Leon apart. The tension as Mathilda waits for Leon to open his door having just walked past the bodies of her family will have you on the edge of your seat.Jean Reno as the aforementioned hit-man does fantastically at turning a cold killer into a lovable character. While we're introduced to him through a hit he soon discovers that there is more to life, without being at all sentimental. Natalie Portman does probably the best ever child performance I've ever seen, making her character both adult (she smokes, knows how to use a gun) yet still remains totally innocent. The chemistry between the two is just beautiful.On the villain side, Gary Oldman is just brilliant as the corrupt Stansfield, making you totally believe that he is a dangerous nut case.

This is coming from someone who can watch one horror movie after another and not be the least bit disturbed.  In addition to the awkwardness I felt, I also found myself checking my watch.  It's almost like sitting down and eating your favorite meal and over eating.  You walk away feeling less satisfied than you would have with a smaller portion.  None of this means that the international version is a bad movie.  It's still magnificent, and probably the best action movie ever.  This is just one of those rare cases where less is more.",Léon - The Professional
348,vze3vhtf,One of My All Time Favorite Movies...,9,30 April 2014,"Possible Spoilers: OK-So let's say it's circa 1993, and your Luc Besson, pitching this film to the potential producers.You tell them that you want to make a serious action/drama, where a professional hit man is the good guy, and law enforcement are the bad guys--But that's just for starters:-The hit man's love interest is a 12 year old girl!-And they have a relationship that is tender and caring, without being creepy!-And Jean Reno, & especially the great Gary Oldman, are sure to deliver in their roles. But the real star will be 13-year old Natalie Portman, whose performance is so amazing that it's almost unbelievable!-And the over-the-top-action, that would be absurd in nearly any other context, will work here.Sounds ridiculous, doesn't it?

349,kjruk,Pointless,5,5 March 2013,"I have no idea why anyone should think this film is so great. It's yet another modern mess of morals, purpose and execution. Psycho killers everywhere. And why does Hollywood sexualise young girls. At least it's girls. It isn't funny or interesting to see a sick underage girl coming on to a grown man. But in case you don't know it is very French. In modern Hollywood everybody behaves just like nobody does behave. And here is a hero who is a professional killer - reminds me of a few other films! And he is supposed to have a heart. Yeah right. And a young girl who also wants to be a killer. I suppose it's nice to pass on your skills to an apprentice. I can't think of any other rational reason why he would go along with her twisted ideas. But of course there are no reasons in films like this. ""Who shall I kill""? Whoever. He says. Then she becomes a sort of little wife even cleaning his guns for him. Ah nice. She was a good choice because she had one of those adult faces on a baby body and she hasn't really changed much apart from her body catching up. This really is one sick, messed up kid who any decent person would take to a child psychiatrist. And a decent person would protect a child not go along with her sick ideas. So thats what I mean about characters not doing anything like what even fictional characters would do. Stupid and unbelievable. OK the reluctant adult saddled with a kid has all been done before. This time it is not believable like the rest of the film. And why is he living in such rubbish conditions if he earns so much. No idea. Oldman as the villain does a good job as mr psycho but the idea he works in the Department of Justice is ridiculous unless it is a metaphor which it isn't. If there is a point to this film it isn't worth knowing.",Léon - The Professional
350,tjcclarke,Masterful,10,29 March 2004,"I have long thought that owning films on DVD or video is a waste of money - you watch them once and after that they are left to fester at the back of a cupboard. Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hitmen.It obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as Jean Reno. Thin and wiry with toilet brush hair and a face like a bag of spanners, he is hardly your typical gun-toting action hero, but he has an innocence and compassion that makes you fall for him instantly. Leon's life is as simple as a small child's: TV, lashings of milk and the odd gangland assassination. He cannot read, he doesn't sleep, he hasn't the trappings of family or wealth (the fees for his hits are habitually trousered by his `benefactor': sleazy small-time Italian gangster Tony (Danny Aiello)) - In short, he lives like a robot. And then he meets Mathilda.Normally I can't stand Hollywood kids. They are all doey-eyed, bouffant-haired brats who can cry on cue and are always ready with a cutesy, smart-alec comment that will cause their adult co-stars to tinkle with laughter or tousle their hair playfully. Often they are kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry. I for one am usually rooting for the kidnappers.Natalie Portman's Mathilda is the antithesis of these namby-pamby Dawson's Creek actors-in-waiting. For starters, she has something justifiable to gripe about, in that her entire family has just been slaughtered by Gary Oldman and his gang of crooked DEA officers. This is a bit of a blow, to say the least, but Mathilda takes it all in her stride and teams up with Leon in a bid for revenge. So begins one of the stranger relationships in silver screen history, but one of the most memorable.On the face of it, a love story between a twelve year old girl and a hairy French hitman would raise a few eyebrows among more conservative movie-goers, but director Luc Besson handles it so beautifully, it seems like the most natural thing on earth. They are united in being totally alone in the world - indeed, the scene where Mathilda walks quietly down the corridor past the carnage in her apartment and knocks on Leon's door, imploring him in a tearful whisper to let her in is as breathtaking as it is heartbreaking. Leon is wary at first, but she soon wins him round and starts to gently bring him out of the shell.Portman is truly astonishing - one can almost forgive her for being a part of the appalling Star Wars prequels on the strength of this one performance. The iconic image of this tiny, grubby little girl clutching Leon's beloved plant and trotting to keep up with her lanky hero's giant strides is one that will live long in the memory.Aiello and Oldman (at his sadistic, malevolent best) provide predictably excellent support, there is a wonderfully suspenseful yet satisfying ending - heck, there's even a decent Sting song playing over the credits - for this (if nothing else) it would be remiss of me to give Leon anything other than top marks.10/10",Léon - The Professional
351,sudhirkumarpal8,One of the best action movie I have ever watched.,9,12 April 2021,"Action + Adolescence = Blast.It's all about this. A young girl in her teens, a 30s something hitman with emotions no better than the former and one crazy psychotic corrupt cop. The result, all sparks of nerve-chilling violence and action and inexplicable feelings. The 90's touch to that all added the glitter.Natalie Portman was doing such serious roles in her teenage years was like a marvel. That I think puts her in the same league as of DiCaprio and Christian Bale, or probably better as their roles were not so intense. No wonder she turned out to be one fine actress of her time. Pretty excited to see her in the new Thor movie.Reno on the other hand looked like one supporting actor to her. Nonetheless he perfectly carried the role of one professional killer. Looks like he had the the looks as well as the talent for that.The antagonist too was a good match with those fierce looks and dead eyes. This makes the movie with all it's elements in balance, keeping you hooked to it till the last scene.

After the first time I saw it, I saw it over and over, maybe 10 times, until I had to return it to the video store. Now it has become my all time favourite movie. This movie has everything that a great movie should have; a good script, a good directing, a good cinematography, good actors, good soundtrack and good edit.  Actors were so mature that every character existed.  Especially I couldn't believe that it was Natalie Portman's debut film. The cinematography was somewhat similar to the European art movies, which I love, and Eric Serra's melancholic music made this movie even more emotional.  The best thing, however, about this movie is the story.  The innocent love between Leon and Mathilda was very fairy tale like but still very beliavable and moving. Luc Besson had created the most expert killer in film history, after this movie came out killers in other movies are always compared with Leon, with humanity, which is very original. Luc Besson is not the greatest movie director alive.  ""The Last Battle"", ""The Big Blue"" and ""La Femme Nikita"" were good but ""Subway"", ""The Fifth Element"", ""Taxi"" and ""Joan of Arc"" were disappointing.  But still, Luc Besson is a wonderful writer/ director because of Leon.  Leon the director's cut has come out recently.

Plus this is one of the best movies of Jean Reno, I would say.It was so touching how the hit-man Leon isn't made to be too kind character - after all he is a hit-man and people with such profession are not usually very kind(!). But this movie is after all all about character development, just like most of the movies are.Even the bad guy of the movie, the DEA boss is a deep character. Same guy that was in 5th Element - brilliant actor. It's much to his skill that makes this movie work so well. Then again actor such as Jean Reno needs a counterpart almost as strong as him.Music was good enough but didn't really leave me touched.

365,vinnieboards,A French Cleaner with a difference...,10,24 June 2011,"On paper, the plot line for this film is an absolute nightmare – controversial and even sick if handled by the wrong director. And yet Luc Besson conjures up an intricate, touching and taught thriller which ranks as a landmark piece of cinema.Leon is essentially a love story between a French hit-man (referred to as a 'cleaner') and a 12 year old girl whose family are brutally murdered by a monstrous DEA official come drug dealer (Gary Oldman). Leon (Jean Reno) is a meticulous assassin carrying out $5000 hits for the Italian underworld. He never actually gets paid as his boss Tony looks after his money for him (safer than a bank) though the reality is that he is being fleeced. He is socially and emotionally like a child – his simple life consists of drinking milk, watching Gene Kelly films, caring for a plant and sleeping upright in a chair with a gun by his side. He can't read and lives a solitary existence. His life changes when one day, a 12 year girl called Matilda (Natalie Portman) returns to the apartment building with some cartons of milk for him. As she walks past her own apartment to knock on Leon's door she sees that her family have been brutally murdered. In tears, she pleads with Leon to open the door, starting a relationship which ultimately ends in tragedy.Leon reluctantly takes Matilda under his wing and teaches her the skills of the expert hit-man because it's all he knows and over time they form an unbreakable bond.The film works for two simple reasons – Portman's pre-adolescent character means that she is too young to truly understand the implications of what she saying i.e. about love and sex. In Leon's case, he is in some ways even more of a child and therefore incapable of taking any sinister advantage of the situation. The result is a touching love story without any hint of perversity - their love is genuine but there is no hint of it crossing the lines of common decency. The controversial scene where Matilda asks to sleep with him was cut in the American screening and yet it is clear that Matilda doesn't really understand what she is saying nor does Leon have any intention of entertaining the prospect. The way in which they say goodbye to each other in what turns out to be the very last time is very much in the father daughter mould.Besson came up with Leon's character from a bit part Reno played in a previous film, La Femme Nikita , and the way Reno portrays Leon quite rightly turned him into an international movie star. His understated performance in direct contrast to the brashness of Matilda, is perfectly judged and the empathy you feel for his character is almost immediate.Gary Oldman's role is brutal, terrifying and wonderfully sinister. A glorious, over the top, drug fuelled nutcase with a passion for Beethoven. But it is Portman who steals the film and quite rightly so. When Luc Besson casted for the part of Matilda, he wanted someone young – somebody who did not understand the meaning of love. In her screen test, Portman was told the scene – that she is walking towards Leon's apartment when she discovers that her family including her 4 year old brother have been brutally murdered. She started to cry immediately – Besson had found her Matilda.It is amazing that Natalie Portman appeared in the awful Star Wars Prequels after a giving such a wonderful performance in Leon. There are very few child actors who could have delivered an acting master class like this – the only comparison I can think of is Jodie Foster in Taxi Driver. Even more remarkable, Portman had received little in actor training or experience before this film. During the making of the movie, the first time she had to be tearful, the crew used methanol to help her appear to be crying. She only used this once, as she was able to generate the emotion and tears by herself - quite a feat for an 11 year old girl.Fortunately, Natalie had very good parents who had certain control over the way she was used in the film. You never see Matilda draw on a cigarette and she gives up smoking later in the film. A planned shower scene where Matilda prances around naked was thankfully scrapped. Leon is a film of many complexities and one of the best thrillers I have seen personally. Whether you see it in the normal or Directors Cut version (the long version as Reno calls it), it's a must have. We must also hope that Besson writes a script for a new film, Matilda, so we can all see what happens to her character in the future. Portman has already stated she would do this at the drop of a hat, relishing the chance to work with Besson again – here's hoping.It is a magnificent piece of cinema.",Léon - The Professional
366,Hellsinger,Another example of simplicity at its best,10,9 June 2004,"What makes Leon so excellent, is the simplicity of the scenario. With the very limited amount of different places being shot, the movie still remains great as it makes an impact on the performance of the leading actors.Jean Reno plays a hitman, and despite that, he is a sweet guy, in life, he simply does his job as cleaner. Cleaner which also at the start is used ironically. Luc Besson does a great job to pay attention to all details, and he leaves little space for errors in acting. I also liked this idea with the plant, that Reno keeps clean and safe throughout this movie.In a nutshell, great great movie, 10/10 for sure.",Léon - The Professional
367,marshalskrieg,A dissenting view...,4,4 April 2017,"'Leon:The Professional' is a sophisticated action flick possessing a high degree of character development juxtaposed against a realistic enough plot... the fight scenes are totally thrilling. The film unfolds with a technical expertise we expect from a master craftsman- to many, this is a masterpiece. Unfortunately, the film offers an approving view of an inappropriate relationship between the hit man Leon and the recently orphaned girl Matilda (who always dresses like a hooker, btw). He is over 40, she is 12 years old. The original script called for an even more intense or raw exposition of their relationship, and in the international release we get plenty of hints about this. This is a compelling film but I agree with the late great Roger Ebert on this one- the films use of a 12 year old (Natalie Portman in her first role) for the subject matter is creepy. I also find it odd that most reviewers seem to miss what the film is really saying.

378,Oorag,Response to criticism,10,24 January 2000,"I'm not too surprised someone could not like this movie, since it is very violent and features characters with questionable morals. I'd like to respond to them. Leon: Yes he's an assassin. Is he a ""good"" man? The thing with Leon seems to be that he really a child. He does his job with such detached efficiency that the viewer has to doubt whether he really understand what he is doing. His paternal affection for a plant and his love of old cinema hint at an innocence that is somehow protected from his violent acts, and could in some strange way be the cause of his unnatural skill in his job. While Gary Oldman snarls and dances as he kills, Reno is just pulling a trigger. Are we supposed to like him? Is he a hero? Leon is what we call an Antihero. That is, a main character of the story with flaws or questionable morals. The movie challenges us to accept the enigma that is Leon, not necessary like him. Matilda: Contrasting Leon in almost every way, there is Matilda. A young girl who is wise to the ways of the world, she wants to kill. Leon is the real child, an innocent, and the one with the power to kill. Matilda is also just coming into puberty. Don't tell me that when young boys hit puberty they don't want to look at dirty little pictures of adult women. Why would girl's infatuation be different? Her infatuation is more than a crush, she lusts his power to kill as well. Her blase reaction to Leon's preffsion ""Cool"" is not a battlecry for young middle-schoolers to start taking sharp-shooting classes in anticipation of a future career in contract killing, it is a jarring reminder that Matilda's life has been tainted with violence, that she now craves it and wants to be able to inflict it.Leon's tutalege isn't moral. Leon is trying to be a parental figure, but killing is the only thing he knows. Its a twisted father-daughter relationship, founded on the promise of violence and complicated by sexual tension. Anyone who claims there is no sexual tension between the two is lying or blind. Is this crush glorified as cool and hip? Heck no. The clerk reacts in surprise and disgust, and Leon clearly sees himself as a father figure. Despite all of this baggage, a bond developes between the two, perhaps because they are two halves of a whole person. Together they are one. Well anyway, this is all just my reaction to the movie. If you look a little closer, I'm sure you'll realize that this movie is not trumpeting ""Have sex with older men with big sniper rifles!""",Léon - The Professional

Although controversial, Leon teaches Mathilda to 'clean' in the hope of giving her purpose and they become their own version of Bonnie and Clyde, but their relationship is far from simple.

386,thefilmguy7,The Professional is a mess,5,19 January 2010,"I just watched Leon The Professional and I'm a little perplexed as to why this film has such high ratings. While Jean Reno delivered a solid performance, the film felt like a mess for the most part. There were HUGE gaps in logic and reason with some of the plot points. What was up with Gary Oldman? Was he like the emperor of the DEA? The crap that he got away with is totally impossible. I don't even see how the guy could work in the DEA considering that he is a total psychotic. The whole finale was ridiculous too. Did Luc Besson bother to take any time at all in researching DEA procedures or protocols? The DEA acted more like the mob than anything.It's one thing to ask the audience to suspend disbelief but this film takes that to a whole other level. It goes so far out of the realm of possibility in places that it becomes more of a fantasy/sci fi film than a crime action film. Also what was up with the music? It was always totally inappropriate for the scenes. It was just completely off and awkward. I really wanted to like this film. I have generally been a fan of Luc Besson's other films and I'm a fan of the cast. Unfortunately this movie was a real challenge to sit through. Now there were some redeeming moments. I liked the little moments that established Leon's character. How he drinks milk, cares for his plant, and sits in the dark. I liked some of the little moments between Leon and Mathilda. There were a few good action beats. However none of these positives are enough to give the film the kind of rating that it has here on IMDb. The film is average at the very best. It offers no intelligence or soul to it's story. The concept could have worked if it was done correctly but sadly it wasn't.",Léon - The Professional

By the time the film's climax arrives, you just know what's going to happen and it's horrifying. You can taste the satisfaction you feel when Oldman's character gets his just desserts.

Located somewhere between ""Lolita"" and ""Natural born killers"". It emphasizes the complicity that develop the protagonists, complementary and symmetrical at the same time, in a history of forbidden love but that its infantile air prevents the morbid. Attention to Gary Oldman's performance as villain. Three very exaggerated characters defined by an interpretation of high voltage. It is a very complete film although the end seems a little softened (I understand that there was an alternative ending so much more crude?)

The first one concerns Mathilda's ""first hit"".  The second, in chronological order, concerns Leon's ""first love"".I can see from the editor's point of view that there were indeed some scenes that were a bit out of place, and perhaps lagged a bit, but I have to argue that there was definitely some incredible pieces of film being blatantly chopped off of Besson's masterpiece.  Not since a certain New York DJ was sued by the FCC have I seen such a horrible stifling of genius by censorship.Violence and sex have been major themes in movies for a long time, but mixing children with violence and sex is taboo, at least thats what the censors had in mind.  As a previous IMDb reviewer stated, these scenes are in fact disturbing, but that is exactly what Besson has in mind.  By cleaning up the film to present it in its ""R"" version, much of the emotional connection Besson crafted was lost, and just a little bit of the meaning behind some major plot tools (I'll be as vague as possible to protect those who have not seen the uncut version) such as the ""ring trick"", the ""pink dress"", the ""skull cap"" (or whatever its called), and the ""bed share"".If you love this film, buy the DVD: unrated version, and enjoy.

An assassin is someone who kills people for aliving. This is not a nice, responsible adult. Portraying him as a supportive caregiver is insane. Why would he ever take in a 12 year old girl? Because he's lonely? Don't you think this would get in the way of his work? I like the scene where he tells her not to smoke cigarettes. This guy kills people but he's got a problem with cigarettes.I also like the cliched portrayal of his two-faced boss. That's original.Or how about Gary Oldham as a psycho d.e.a. agent...don't get me wrong I think the government is full of psychos, but really would a complete raving psychopath get this far up in the political machinery? I kind of doubt it. His outbursts have to be bad for p.r. And then we come to Natalie Portman's character. A 12 year old orphan thinks it'd be a good idea to move in with an assassin? I guess her parents never told her not to talk to strangers. And then she's going to become an assassin? If your parents had just gotten killed by people you don't even know, would you want to move in with an assassin and become one? Doesn't she have relatives? This film is completely ridiculous.

399,barrwell,"This is from Mathilda....a beautiful, entertaining film with heart.",9,8 October 2010,"Its nice to see another of my personal favorites score so highly with IMDb reviewers! The professional is about a hit-man Leon (Jean Reno) who befriends young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) after her family is murdered. Mathilda decides she wants revenge and insists Leon teach her how to ""clean"". A very touching relationship then develops between the two which is at the center of this amazing film. I really love this movie!I need to comment on the actors here. This is the first time I saw Ms. Portman on film was captivated by her from the first time I saw The Professional (and have been ever since in 'Beautiful girls', V for vendetta,'Black Swan' etc). Mathilda has had a tough life, her father and older sister were both abusive to her and her step-mother didn't seem to care. She hated the school she attended and liked to hang out on the stairway of her apartment building sneaking cigarettes. Portman plays her as vulnerable, distressed yet strong and endearing...and totally believable the whole way.Then there's Gary Oldman, who in my opinion is absolutely the finest character actor in movies over the last 20 years or so. I've never seen him give a bad performance (he was especially great in the 1990 film ""State of Grace""). Oldman here delivers what may be his best performance ever as the sleazy, psychotic DEA agent Stansfield. We watch him chew on his mysterious pills while cracking his neck and listen as he obsesses with Beethoven and think...wow! this is one of the creepiest characters ever put on film. During the climactic scene he tells an assistant to ""send me everyone"" and the assistant incredulously asks ""everyone?"" to which Stansfield chillingly screams ""EVERYONE!!""...we get the point, the guy is nuts but has power...and cops show up in droves.I don't mean to underrate Reno's performance here, he is quietly brilliant, the best I've ever seen of him to date. Leon doesn't have a whole lot of dialog as the professional, and thats by design as the character is Italian and we presume he hasn't been in the United States for long and doesn't know a whole lot of English. Reno is perfect in the role, and when he delivers that signature line I quoted above...""this is from Mathilda""...it packs a powerful and emotional punch. It's a truly great payoff scene.This is not necessarily a movie with a happy ending, but this isn't meant to be a feel-good movie, it's bigger than that. However, it IS very satisfying and a nice symbolic scene at the end on the lawn of Mathilda's new school ties it all up very nicely. If you are choking back tears, you are not alone.Real nice song by Sting ""shape of my heart"" over the closing credits caps it off..Enjoy.",Léon - The Professional
400,Shrykespeare,Simply Brilliant,10,2 June 2004,"Where to begin?I put Natalie Portman's performance in this movie alongside Haley Joel Osment's in The Sixth Sense as one of the best acting jobs by a preteen in any movie, ever. The reason is this: when a child has a lead role in a movie that he/she would not be old enough to see in a theater, you know that it would take a superior performance to truly stand out. And Natalie does not disappoint.*SPOILERS AHEAD*One scene says it all - she returns from the grocery to find her family massacred and the cops who did it still there. Trying not to show how visibly shaken he is, she keeps walking to Leon's door as if it's her own, and her plaintive whimpering for him to let her in nearly made my heart rip in two.Until that moment, Leon had the luxury of keeping the rest of the world outside his door, not getting involved in anyone's life (except to kill them). Initially, he is resistant to having this young waif invading his comfort zone; he even contemplates killing her while she slept! But we know that Leon, like the rest of us, will fall under Mathilda's spell; she's too beautiful, too alone and too in need of a protector for Leon not to fall in love with her.Much has been made about Luc Besson's using a 12-year-old girl as a sexual icon, but that's subject to broad interpretation in my opinion. Twelve is precisely the age that most young girls discover their ability to draw the eyes of men (of ANY age), and I applaud Mr. Besson for embracing that fact instead of acquiescing to the vagaries of political correctness. Is ""Lolita"" a great work of literature or simply child pornography? Girls that age have always been, and will always be, desired by older men. Call it what you will: reprehensible, disgusting, perverted; but that doesn't make it less true.Gary Oldman has built his career on playing villains, and few play them as well as he. Whether a scene calls for him to be quietly menacing or deliciously over-the-top, he can do it. The Professional, Dracula, Hannibal, The Fifth Element... he brings a dramatic flair to his bad guys that makes him stand apart from many who play movie villains.I don't know what substance it was that Gary's character took (perhaps someone will tell me?), but whatever it was, it set him into an altered state of consciousness wherein killing an entire family was akin to conducting a symphony orchestra. And hearing him scream ""EVERYYYYONNNEEEEE!!!"" sent chills up my spine!And last but not least, Jean Reno as Leon, the title character, was perfectly done. Speaking English with a thick enough accent that we were JUST able to understand what he was saying, Jean was able to infuse a depth of character into Leon with seemingly very little effort. Mathilde, in a very short time, transforms Leon from cold remorseless killer into a valiant avenging angel. We want so badly for them to make that daring escape and have that happy ending that they deserve, but we all know deep down that it just wasn't going to happen.In the final scene, when Mathilde replants Leon's beloved potted plant in the yard of her boarding school, we are left with such a sense of not only happiness but sadness as well, which is accentuated by the haunting strains of Sting's ""Shape of My Heart"", the perfect ending to a fabulous movie.My score: 10.",Léon - The Professional
401,gillespiesan,After 27 years...,9,13 August 2021,"So why now, after first seeing this movie on its original theatrical run 27 years ago at London's Odeon, Kensington High Street do I suddenly feel the need to write a review of a movie I've since watched countless times? I guess it was receiving the 4K blu-ray of the movies as a birthday present and sitting down to watch it again that was the catalyst but in all fairness, I should have done it a long time ago..I'm going to assume at this point that nobody reading this hasn't seen this movie. If, by some quirk of fate, you haven't...well, stop reading now and go and watch it, that would be a far more productive use of your time. Given that everybody else reading has seen it, I just want to make a couple of observations on this remarkable piece of work.Perhaps the most obvious thing about this movie is absolutely NO WAY would it get made today. Hollywood's woke mafia would pretty quickly see to that. The pitch meeting for a proposed movie in which an orphaned and therefore vulnerable twelve year old girl and a middle aged Italian immigrant hit man enter into a dubious relationship would be a wonder to behold - I'd pay to see that! The movie itself is in no way problematic in this respect, with Leon himself being more of a 'child' than Mathilda is. Still, the issue is an obvious sticking point...I can remember leaving the theater 27 years ago with my friend Tim and, for most of the drive home, he remained quite - most unlike him. After a while, he sheepishly said '...I found that girl attractive. Is that a problem?' to which I laughed and said reassuringly 'you were meant to, that's the whole idea!'All these years later, Leon remains Luc Besson's finest work by quite some way. I enjoyed 'The Fifth Element', 2014's Scarlett Johansson-fronted Sci-fi romp Lucy and even the B-movie mediocracy of Anna. Nothing the man has done before or since matches the artistry of Leon. Story, casting and execution came together perfectly on this movie, the stars were aligned. I don't give marks of 10, that's perfection. Perfection doesn't exist and so I'll go with a 9...",Léon - The Professional
402,Percivalx,The Good And The Bad On Leon,6,22 July 2007,"For every good thing about Leon: The Professional, there is an equal and opposite item that just blows it.The good news is that Leon makes for an entertaining viewing experience. Portman and Reno give really good performances, the movie is well-photographed, and the action scenes are great.The bad news is that some of the intended humor does not work at all, such as when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that Leon is her lover. Furthermore, Oldman's character is more of a caricature than a character. It's hard to believe Stansfield, a man with clear psychotic behavior, would hold such an important position in the DEA. One also has to wonder if every cop in NYC is as corrupt as Stansfield when a slew of them help him burst into an apartment, kill everyone in sight, including a 4 year-old child, all without raising any red flags. But the hardest thing to believe was how Mathilda's father, knowing what was coming, would not have had his entire family out of that apartment by noon.

Perhaps Reno will once again garner better roles than a French DOI officer battling a giant lizard in New York. But it doesn't matter if they don't.By pairing for this masterful movie the two have produced a film which will definitely live on throughout history long after all of the riff-raff-flicks are lost and forgotten. This film is definitely deserving of a place in the top 50 films of all time.Outstanding performances burn up this stellar flick. If you don't know the show's storyline, here's the short-short version. An immigrant hit-man (Reno) becomes responsible for, and eventually falls in love with a young girl, Mathilda (played marvelously by Natalie Portman) whose family was murdered by a dirty DEA agent (the always superb Gary Oldman) and his team. Our heroic hit-man must protect the girl and avenge her family's death.More than just a compelling action drama, the film focuses its attention on the truth of humanity that people are social creatures and need companionship. While at first Leon is cold and commanding towards his young charge, he eventually warms to her more than he wants to admit to himself. When Mathilda's desire for vengeance places her in harms way, Leon's true feelings burst forth in a hail of bullets and bloodshed that would make the Terminator think twice about messing with this man.The story is solid.

Then she falls in love with you and you didn't ask for it. Gee, it's such a passionate subject and Besson takes on it in a way that you really feel for the characters. Reno and Portman have such a great chemistry on-screen and all the scenes that were deleted are really necessary to understand what happens at the end of the movie. Portman plays the perfect ""Lolita"" : beautiful and innocent, and at the same time really smart and determined.

Extraordinary is the perfect world for Luc Besson, he has an imagination not matched by most people and he puts this into his movies perfectly and as such i can watch any of his movies once every day for the rest of my life.

412,sfworthington,He's a Professional,10,19 November 2020,"Leon is one of the best hitman in New York, a silent killer with no empathy for those he ""cleans"". However, he becomes responsible for his next door neighbour, 12 year old Mathilda, when her family is killed. Despite her age she understands revenge and wants to take it against those who killed her family. Luckily, Leon is a professional and teachers her to ""clean"".Right from the get go you're hit with splashes of smooth camera angles and movements along with a cathartic score so that you are placed right into the action. Leon is a lot more though than a super slick action flick; it's the exploration of a relationship and how two people can connect despite all the odds. Leon and Mathilde's relationship is genuinely one of the best I think I've ever seen on cinema because the intentions are just never in question, you completely understand how they understand each other.Leon is another prime example of a film that possess both style and substance: it's a cultural phenomenon in how iconic the characters are, it possesses style in the way you expect with it being shot like a fast-paced action film yet the characters are rich and fully fleshed and there are genuine stakes, complex emotions and topics that really do make you think. It really was just a film that caught my attention and kept it for the entirety of the film; it ended and my first thought was I wanted to watch it again and I haven't had that reaction to a film in a long time. There's probably a lot I haven't said in terms of how this film made me feel or what it made me think but I'm still in a state of somewhat awe so I'm afraid I can't put those thoughts into words right now.

414,sammy105,"A timid masterpiece, one to take your breath away better than most academy award winners today",10,30 May 2007,"This movie simply put is a cinematic masterpiece. Rarely does a movie get me to... practically sob unstoppably almost from beginning to end, but this one did. Every detail is licked, the music not only flows along with every moment, but adds a good deal of content all on its own.Luc Besson, unlike most directors nowadays it seems, has an excellent take on child phychology, right up there with Stephen King himself. A child is shown here not as a fragile creature in need of constant looking over by adults, but more like a member of a society like any other red-blooded American. The fact that kids are susceptible to practically all the dangers that adults are today is portrayed in the movie very well.The movie does not have scenes that attract attention by asking the actors show weakness, to cry, to express feelings with words, but everything is done in situations, music, and cinematic tricks of different kinds.This is not a movie to make one feel gooey and tender on the inside, but rather to provoke a spurt of emotion that hides inside every one of us. Not the kind that's felt by watching a romance flick. This is something different. Modern movie makers have quite a few things to learn from Besson. Movies like this one can change our skewed outlook on life and... make us born again.",Léon - The Professional
415,streetrodfan,I just saw this recentally but it was a very beautiful movie,10,18 June 2013,"There has never been anything else like this in my opinion. This is easily one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. I'm not really sure why but it's a very touching film. I was really blown away haha. This isn't much of a review. Leon is a very human character, he's got a lot of depth to him. The entire cast is brilliant, the story is brilliant. It's honestly one of the best films I've ever seen in my life. I know these reviews are silly but I just love this movie. Portman is at her best here.This movie has the most realistic performances I've seen in some time. This movie is a masterpiece to me, I felt like it was a true story when it had finished. It felt so real. I actually thought about the characters and worried for them or connected to them on a very real level. This movie was deep, take my word for it haha. I don't have all the words right now but this film is a work of art.It felt very real to me, and it touched me on a deep level that I don't quite understand. After watching this I hugged my mother good night haha and went upstairs to write this review. This movie is truly one of a kind. This film is a work of art. I can't place my finger on all the reasons but it will linger on as a beautiful tapestry in my subconscious mind for some time, inspiring me and giving me a new perspective on film. I was touched by this movie. There's some kind of genius involved with this movie. This movie is some how profound. It's one of my favorite movies now. I would watch it again and I think it would only be better a second viewing. I've given up on modern film. This is a true gem, classic that I hadn't seen before. Now that I've seen it, it's easily one of my favorite films.It has more than what you see upfront, but it's not pretentious about it. It's deep without trying too hard to be deep. I was very absorbed , the movie felt to be the perfect length, had a great cast, perfect dialog, I loved everything about this movie.There it is, I loved this movie. There's not much to say , I made a deeper connection with it, I'm not entire sure how, why but I fell in love with this movie. It's one of my favorites now.",Léon - The Professional

418,narine_tevosyan,Classic 90s Movie,10,29 April 2019,"""Leon"" in the top in my list of favorites movies, and I think that is one of the best movies of all times. The story does a great job of avoiding the ""big"" stuff in favor of the smaller, more intimate story. We don't delve into what the whole of the Italian mafia is doing in the film, or about how wide Stansfeld's drug empire goes, his motivations... all the movie focuses on is Leon and Mathilda. Also, it shows so much emotion on everything and the characters they did were amazing, Jean Reno showing how sweet an assassin can be and Natalie Portman how little girl can be so intelligent. The advantages of this movie is the actors play. You can't find two actors who work together so well with such a gap between their ages. Another plus is the music choice of this movie, which makes the mood of the movie more understandable. After listening Sting's Shape Of My Heart in this movie, this song remains in our hearts.
Hence, I really suggest everyone to watch this movie, beccuse you will find not only one of the best movies, but also one the most heartbreaking songs.",Léon - The Professional
419,YouRebelScum,"Depraved, perverted, sick and manipulative",1,28 May 2004,"I have to say I found this movie so offensive I stopped watching it after about half an hour. It's beyond just violent, it's pornographically, sickeningly, gloatingly violent, and the victims aren't bad guys but naked women and kids. The jarring discontinuity between the excrutiatingly graphic murder of her family andMathilda's lack of emotional response is especially disturbing.There is a line of good taste which even action movies shouldn't cross and, for me, this one - like Face/Off - crosses it. Women and children can be 'in peril' but shouldn't  be killed, especially not with the kind of gleeful sadistic intensity shown here. If you want to make a movie where women and children are goingto be the victims, then for me it's a different class of movie, not an action thriller. It goes without saying that the director's attribution of sexual characteristics to a 12-year old child - and the way he deliberately perverts the friendship between Leon and Mathilda in a sexual way - is deeply sick and utterly reprehensible. Disgusting.",Léon - The Professional
420,IloveHanks,Overrated at 8.6 !,7,7 July 2010,"This movie reaches the heights of predictability that any action movie can possibly get.It is good but is so so so overrated. I will definitely say that it is easily the most overrated movie in IMDb.I could guess its climax in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The action in the movie is very well done. The saving grace is definitely the climax,the ending is superb and really redeems the movie, which otherwise could have been dull and insignificant.The casting consists of Jean reno and Natalie Portman. Natalie Portman is a 12 year old precocious child who has an immature love for Jean Reno who happens to be a Hit-man. After her entire family gets knocked out by Gary Oldman, he takes her into his wings and teaches her the secrets behind becoming a hit-man or say a hit-girl rather. Amongst the performances only Portman 's worth watching.. Gary Oldman is disappointing so is Jean Reno.The movie fails mainly because of its poor character development. The characters are very superficial especially Gary Oldman's character.

He I feel sees her as the family he has never had. She obviously has a crush and sees him in romantic way, which he doesn't encourage and struggles to cope with!!! its these unexpected twists in the story and clever sub plot that makes the film stand out from the crowd. its a modern classic and needs 10 stars.

And Leon comes to have feeling. This movie contains all the elements have scenes with tension, calm scene, and the scene laughable. An action scene is impressive. Camera work is also wonderful. Fusion of showy action and true love calls big impression for the last scene. Even when you dislike an action film, since this work has the contents, I think that it is interesting for everyone. I was very impressed with the figure that Matilda is endure the sadness. Natalie's overwhelming presence of that time 13 years old is wonderful. Leon is good at teaching about how to use a weapon.

So, everyone goes in love, travels, and socializes, to a large extent just to meet someone who can love each other.The reason I like this film is actually not as grand as the above.

A killer takes a girl under his wings and they become a support duo and she asks for sex and there is sexual tension and then it is all made bigger and more present because the man's first love is his job. That is why he is a professional and so the story cleverly mixes love and violence like sex and violence which are human feelings and the film becomes explosive.

429,mjl1966,Stunning first performance by Natalie Portman,10,23 October 2021,"Despite Ms. Portman later feeling uncomfortable about her role in this film, her portrayal of a violently orphaned 13-year-old is nothing short of astonishing.After her dysfunctional family is killed by a rogue DEA agent and his cadre, young Mathilda seeks refuge with the affable hit-man living just down the hall. As she rings the doorbell, she breaks down and starts crying as it finally hits her that her little brother has just been brutally murdered.And so begins a relationship of revenge, healing and mutual affection between two very lonely people. Besson pulls no punches in revealing Mathilda's emerging sexuality as Mathilda begins to fall in love with her reluctant guardian. But unlike the misadventures of an older man and young temptress from Nabokov, the relationship here isn't seedy, cynical or perverse. It is actually quite poignant as the simple-minded hit-man quietly contains Mathilda's amorous advances without withdrawing from her. He is genuinely fond of her and this is beautifully played out by Jean Ruso as he protects and guides, as best as a hit-man can, his protégé.Ultimately, this is a love story between two people who can't have each other yet still protect each other in ways both dramatic and sublime. The love is awkward, clumsy and naïve in a gritty and tender way all at the same time. But it is genuine and heart-felt. Very few directors would be able to pull off this kind of story, so this is a bit of a gem -- I don't think we'll ever see anything quite like this again.I just love this story and Mathilda is one of my all-time favorite characters. Natalie brings a sublimely powerful performance to the screen that you will remember for a long time.I'm just sorry that she isn't proud of it. She should be. It's a powerful story. Yes, Mathilda is sexualized, but her character, as portrayed by Portman, is so much more than that. We get that. Honest, we really do.",Léon - The Professional
430,LennyRenquist,A classic,10,23 September 2005,"It's a much sparer film than many of Luc's others (particularly his subsequent ones), and has a definite small-scale feel about it, which is a good thing. It's brilliantly scripted and directed, and superbly paced...long periods of calm, leading up to bursts of intense action. The humour works well, too.Jean Reno is absolutely top-notch as Leon, the awkward, shy guy who becomes an invisible killing machine whenever he goes to work, and exhibits a sort of childish glee when watching Gene Kelly on the big screen. He's funny, deep, mature and childlike all at the same time, and it's a pleasure to watch.Nat, too, is simply amazing. It's her first movie, and she's only around twelve or thirteen, but I don't think she's given a more accomplished performance since (at least, not in a movie I'm willing to watch). The bit where she's standing at Leon's door sobbing her little eyes out kills me every time.It's nice to see Gary Oldman playing a villain for once ;). He's in peak form here, as a linen suit-wearing, pill-popping, Beethoven-loving, ultra-violent sociopath. He's a total nut-bag, but very cool with it. Even when he's slaughtering innocent women and children, you can't help but like him.Or, is that just me...?Eric Serra's score actually WORKS this time.

436,javold,Killed by bad writing,7,24 November 2000,"Most of the IMDb commentators seem to find no fault in this movie, which I can almost understand.  The acting, directing and dramatics of the picture are almost there, but not quite. Everything that could be good about this film is limited by faulty writing.  Acting: Aiello is great in a minor part, but bad writing kills all the efforts of Reno and Oldman and the twelve year old.  Leon's character is very one dimensional, leaving Reno no room to stretch as an actor, unless you count his bad John Wayne bit or his plant stroking.  Oldman plays a comic book character, so he can't help being over the top.  As for the kid, she leaves an impression but her part is simply not believable. 
Directing:  Besson was writer and director, so any positive points one might give him for directing are canceled out by the completely implausible story and unmemorable dialog.  Dramatics:  There were some very good action scenes, but the ""tender"" Lolita scenes I could do without.  I give the movie a 7 overall.",Léon - The Professional
437,iccqwy,Classic,9,23 June 2020,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",Léon - The Professional
438,Eyes_of_Emerald,Besson's Best,10,12 October 2003,"We watched this last night and even though I've seen it at least ten times it never ceases to amaze me.Besson has taken the typical ""lone assassin on the move"" movie and made it into something ethereal.  Jean Reno's Leon and Natalie Portman's Mathilda are absolutely flawless together.  The best scene between them IMHO (without giving it away) is the guessing game they play together.  We are really able to see Leon's heart melting as he and this girl become closer and closer, and he doesn't allow the relationship with her to change or alter hardly any of the lifestyle he is accustomed to.Gary Oldman (has this man gotten an Oscar?  If not, WHY????) is his usual wonderful, psychotic, static self.  Every scene he's in is a wonder to watch.  Check out his scene in the men's room with Mathilda.  Both Natalie Portman and he give their all in a most gripping scene.Natalie Portman is a gem.  Danny Aiello and the rest of the cast are top-notch also.  What more could you expect from Besson?  It's best to try and catch this uncut, however, seeing it on cable with dubbing over the harsh language and commercials isn't recommended, but if it's all that's available, it will still do.10 out of 10 stars **********",Léon - The Professional

Leon, a professional hit-man who finds peace on his apartment with his pet plant. On the other hand, we've got Mathilda, a young girl who lives trapped inside her own house, with her non-caring parents and sister, finding her only consolation in her younger brother.Trouble starts when Mathilda goes out to buy groceries. While she goes out, a group of drug-dealers make a visit to Mathilda's dad, also a dealer, to find out he has being stealing some of the merchandise. This results in the dealers killing everyone in the house. Mathilda returns, tries to ignore the mess and knocks on Leon's door. He lets her, adopts her, and they both become all they have in life, but Mathilda is seeking revenge for her brother's assassination.So is this a love story? I will say it's inappropriate to call it like that. Is it a family film? Ignoring all the violence, it might be a family film. Is it an action movie then? I think it goes way deeper than that, though the opening and final sequences are worthy of any Die Hard film.You would need to watch it yourself in order to draw your own conclusion on the movie genre.

But why is Leon up there with the best of them? Well, despite the fact that I cannot believe how many times I have watched this movie, we still find it utterly enthralling.  Oldman might be turning in one of those famous PRIME HAM moments of acting but it's done with such relish (as is often the case with him) that you're seduced anyway.  If you analyse it too much, sure, the sub-plot ""romance"" of Matilda and Leon may stir concerns from some citizens; but hey, have you never been a child with a desire to 'love'?  the all-consuming power of a lonely child to need affection is beautifully portrayed here - whether in the character of Matilda or in the formerly functioning but exploited Leon.

Regarding the film, The first impression for me about the film is that the characters are so powerful that each one grabs you till the scene changes, even those who appear not more than some minutes or even seconds.. there is a surprising low-tempo in the middle of the film which - i think- prepares us to the final shot, the music and effects are used in almost every scene, it may absurd to say but this film is like a mixture of a clockwork orange and taxi driver, the characters are very crazy and Mathilda (Natalie Portman) reminded me of Iris (Jodie Foster), The first 30 minutes is a complete master piece, tension is so high that you feel you are in the film witnessing the slaughter in the apartment walking in the corridor, i hardly remember any other film which takes me to the deepest level so powerful and effective (old boy, sympathy for lady vengeance), but i must say that i disliked the music plays before the final shot when Mathilda and Leon seen together for the last time, i don't like too much repetition in Music, and that scene disturbed me because of this, anyway, from the start to the end its one of the craziest yet one of the most sentimental one, get a glass of milk, water your plants and start to watch.",Léon - The Professional

But the fact is, this is one amazing movie. It's the performances and direction that pull it all together. Jean Reno (the hitman), Gary Oldman (the corrupt, pill popping, psychotic cop), & Natalie Portman (the lolita) all put out career defining performances. Danny Aiello (the mob boss) does a great job too. The entire cast should be proud of their work, it's very good. Example: Mathilda (Portman), after getting smacked around by her father asks Leon (Reno), ""Is life always this hard, or just when you're a kid?"" Leon replies, ""Always this hard."" Gary Oldman's outstanding performance is reason enough to see this movie. Now add Portman's equally outstanding screen debut and you have something very special.

I see them as a sadistic father-daughter duo... until Mathilda mentioned wanting to have sex with him.So I enjoyed the movie, but everytime the movie serves you this awkward sexual tension between 12-year-old Mathilda and a really old man, I feel extremely uncomfortable.i think if Mathilda is a bit older or Leon is a bit younger, the falling-in-love part wont bother me as much",Léon - The Professional

The plot is superb. Central to it is the story of a professional ""cleaner"" who according to a sequence of events, becomes responsible for a recently-orphaned girl's revenge of her parents.
Personally speaking, aside from its spectacular storyline, it is the characters who have made a perfection out of it. The great emotional tension between the two main characters is as intense as it is whiplash inducing. Needless to say the characters would not utilize to their full potential if it wasn't for the phenomenal performance of the cast. Natalie Portman shows herself as a highly talented actress with a beyond belief potential and Jena Reno is a complete perfection in portraying his character.
To sum up, there is a lot more to this movie than just some action scenes, unlike other movies of this kind. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie and I thoroughly recommend it.",Léon - The Professional
454,Sickfrog,A Brilliant Conflict,10,14 August 1998,"This film, better known in the U.S. as ""The Professional"", is a wonderful and intense film. Jean Reno plays his role as a ""cleaner"" with incredible subtlety. Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman's performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman's finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of ""La Femme Nikita"" by far with this masterpiece.

When Portman's character asks Reno's if life is always this bad and you expect him to give her a banal platitude but he says, true to his character, ""Yes, always like this."" it sets the intense but powerful tone of this film.

461,muditmonfils,Haunting & Chilling in equal measures!,8,3 June 2012,"Leon is a 1994 thriller directed by French director Luc Besson. Also known as 'The Professional', the film narrates a story about how a hit-man Leon (Reno) gives shelter to a girl Mathilda (Portman) who lives in his neighbourhood after her family is killed by a corrupt DEA officer (Oldman) and his men on the suspicion of stealing his drugs.Mathilda discovers that Leon is a hit-man and works for an Italian mafioso Tony (Aiello). Mathilda begs Leon to teach her his art so that she can take a revenge on the officer who killed her younger brother. In return, she offers to do the household chores apart from teaching him how to read and write. He starts taking her on his assignments where she works as his cleaner and teachers her how to handle guns. One day, when Leon is out on an assignment on his own, Mathilda loads her bag with Leon's guns and bluffs her way into the DEA office after locating it earlier. There she encounters Stansfield who finds about her plans. What happens next?Leon packs some of the most powerful performances in recent times. The role of Mathilda played by a 13 year old Natalie Portman, though much more bolder than to my liking, was superbly portrayed. You'll literally forget that the character is being performed by a 13 year old girl in the movie. It is a very mature character. The character not only loses her family & sees the dead body of her beloved brother, but also carries revenge at such a young age. Mathilda also smokes and is very daring as is shown in the scene where she plans to take on a psychopath drug addict murderer who also happens to be a DEA (Drug Enforcement Administration) officer. The role of Stansfield is the best part of the movie for me. A lot has been written about the character on the internet. People have loved it but also have commented on how the character has been 'overly' stated. I really enjoyed the performance of Gary Oldman. The on-screen presence of the character always gave a very sinister feeling. The way he took his drug, his dialogues (""Death is whimsical today"", ""I like these calm little moments before a storm. It reminds me of Beethoven!""), his unusual calmness and then a sudden burst of rage made his character look very creepy & unpredictable. Stansfield goes down in my book of the best villains of all time! Reno as a hit-man was good. His fight scenes were probably one of the best of his times especially at the end. His character was strong & professional yet emotionally vulnerable. The background score composed by Eric Serra was both haunting and thrilling in equal measures. It brought in a chilly atmosphere in the movie and kept your heart pumping in the close quarter scenes.I happened to watch a Hindi movie called ""Bichchoo"" in 2000 starring Bobby Deol and Rani Mukherjee. After watching Leon I found that Bichchoo was a Hindi remake of the movie. Many scenes especially the ending were almost the same.Overall, Leon is one of the best thriller movies of all time. Although I watched it in 2012, it was released 18 years back in 1994. Many of the scenes especially the ending must have been really thrilling for the audience back then. Elements of the movie have been used by many action movies in the late 90s as well as in the 21st century.

462,gundamgirl2386,"If you haven't already seen this movie, why?",10,15 November 2002,"There are not enough words to describe how amazing this film is.  I admit I am not an action movie person, I find that rarely often do they have a plot or dialogue worth watching.  This is certainly not the case of The Professional aka Leon.  Yes I saw the American regular version because I couldn't find any other.  This is Natalie Portman's best role so far!  It's a movie unlike any other.  When the credits roll you better believe that your mind will be racing with thoughts.  That is just the kind of movie it is, it makes you think.  **Spoiler Alert**I have read a lot of the comments on here about people being uncomfortable or squeamish that any attraction between Mathilda and Leon was more than innocent.  Honestly I don't think it implied anything.  Sure Mathilda had a crush on him but that's what 12 year old girls do, they crush on older guys! And plus the guy saved her life, she was bound to develop a hero-complex towards him.  I am not sure if Leon did feel something more for Mathilda but if he did it's not like he acted on it!  He was no Humbert Humbert, if any sort of romantic feelings were had on his part he knew they were wrong and did not act on them and if you watch you see how uncomfortable he is moments after Mathilda tells him she thinks she is falling in love with him.  I see nothing wrong with how the relationship was played out and what may or may have not been had the ending been different and more happily ever after. I do know about all the parts that were cut from the film and saw the lines from them so I do know how the relationship was played through both versions.**End Spoiler Alert**This is a very touching tale of a hitman and the tragic girl who comes into and changes his life.

I am watching movies from Hollywood and other movie industries since my childhood but much less than Bollywood movies but in last 2 3 years my love towards movies from Hollywood and other movie industries just skyrocketed and I now watch lots of movies from Hollywood and other movie industries and very few Bollywood movies.In that process I saw many movies that Bollywood copied from other movie industries and Léon is one of them.Unless you consider adding songs and other Bollywood garbage big difference, Bichhoo is a complete copy of Léon even some dialogues are just translated. I used the word 'copy' rather than 'remake' because the creators of Bichhoo never admit that their movie is a remake of Léon they just quietly copied it.Now about the original movie. Its just great, despite the fact I already knew many things about this movie including the ending because I saw the Bollywood copy before I saw Léon, I still loved this movie.

However the movie is 20 minutes too long, and due to the uniqueness of the characters the course of action sometimes becomes too unrealistic.

465,Bluecher,Epic action-melodrama that hits (almost) all the right notes,9,16 July 2020,"The most amazing thing about ""Leon"" is that, despite all of its shortcomings (some of them glaringly obvious), the film still manages to come out on top.Yes, the film is derivative in places. (But then what did you expect of yet another hitman movie in 1994?)
Besson borrows heavily from his own ""Nikita"", Melville's ""Le Samourai"" and Cassavetes' ""Gloria"", especially in the first 30 minutes. But after that it quickly takes a shape all its own.
And yes, there are some huge holes in logic but ""Leon"" must be seen more as a modernist fairy-tale than a gritty thriller in order to makes sense.""Leon"" is foremost anchored by the four (yes, that's right!) lead performances by Reno, Portman, Aiello and Oldman, all brilliantly framed by Besson's stylized direction.
All four actors give highly emotional performances unlike anything you have ever seen before. And despite their characters having opposing agendas or being downright antagonist they all seem to be part of the same family. All of their (re-)actions make sense, if judged purely from an emotional POV.This setup is actually strongly reminiscent of Sergio Leone's spagehtti westerns and it is obvious throughout the film that he was a big influence on Besson - from the close-up mughshots to the theme-heavy Morricone-esque score.
But Besson injects a modern style that is partly influenced by John McTiernan, James Cameron, John Woo and french ""cinema du look"", creating a hybrid that is totally original.",Léon - The Professional

Sure, the pacing is a little but slower, but that's a good thing because we end up with characters that have more believable motivation. Those who like this and are open to arty films should check out ""Le Dernier Combat"" -- which is another film by Besson that stars Reno.

Gary Oldman is the perfect bad guy, and acts well, and Jean Reno does a wonderful job of making the character's transition from not loving anymore, to falling in love with a girl who brought his feeling back. That girl is Natalie Portman, wow was she young. She also does well, although she contains the only fault in the movie, and it's not really her, it's the character. I know that Portman's character is supposed to be persistent, but it gets kind of annoying with her, but the acting done by Portman redeems the character anyway. The storyline by Besson is great considering other action movies, and the directing was so well done. BOTTOM LINE: A CLOSE TO PERFECT ACTION MOVIE THANKS TO THE ACTING, FANTASTIC DIRECTION, AND A SCRIPT THAT IS GREAT...IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER ACTION SCRIPTS....the ""You don't like Beethoven do you?"" is the best line of the movie said by Oldman, boy was he creepy.",Léon - The Professional

But it is gradually revealed that he is alone and a professional killer. I was surprised to watch him sleeping while sitting. It must be tough. At first, Leon tries to kill a fat man. In that scene, you hear the heartbeats of the close man and this makes you nervous. Leon gets close to him and put the knife on the men's neck. His heartbeats stops and there are no sound at that time. I gasped at this scene. Matilda, the heroine of this film, is also a lonely although she has a family. Leon refuses her offer to practicing killing at first, but he cherishes her little by little. They spend the time not only practicing killing but also playing and studying and eating. The scenes of Matilda disguises herself as various famous persons is one of my favorite scenes. Of course she is cute, but Leon, wondering who Matilda is imitating is also so cute. They are not on good terms at first. But Leon buys pretty clothes to Matilda. Matilda teaches reading and writing to Leon. They squirt water at each other...they look like real father and daughter day by day. Gary Oldman is one of main characters in this film. He is a merciless man and I was very disgusted at the way he speaks and acts! I hope Leon or Matilda kill him as soon as possible throughout. The climax scene when Oldman mobilizes all the troops is so exciting. The camera-works of this scene is marvelous. I re-winded a film and watched this scene many times. It is very thrilling. When Leon lets Matilda go, I feel very sad. Leon's survival relieves me but at last he dies.

After seeing the new version, I kept saying, ""This new version is 10 times better!"" It was. Even though the first american version was awesome, the new version has more touching scenes. The first version didn't sear as much as I thought it could have. It was missing something. It was as if the movie was beating around the bush instead of diving in. After seeing the Uncut International Version, I can see how deep the film goes. Before, I wasn't sure whether the relationship between Leon and Mathilda was close friendship or love. Now I know it was love. After seeing this version, I understand the emotion and power of The Professional more. Gary Oldman did not have any additional scenes, which kind of left me disappointed as he was a fun loving psychopath that unfortunately shares the same mentality as Alex from A Clockwork Orange.

477,icclyf,Excellent,9,7 July 2020,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler. Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package. Jean Reno plays a character named Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man. His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant. Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role. Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about. Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her. Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope. He moves the story along by his actions. Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about. Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie. Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates. The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",Léon - The Professional
478,Hannibal_Chigurh,A Unique Action Thriller,9,27 October 2007,"Leon The Professional is one of the most captivating action films ever made. I don't think I've ever seen such good acting in any other action flick. Jean Reno plays the hit-man Leon, the best in town. One day he takes in a girl whose family has just been killed by a crazed DEA agent. Mathilda is played by Natalie Portman in her debut performance, and she plays the part flawlessly. She combines the innocence and high-spirits of youth with the somber world-weariness of someone who has seen far more than they should. The DEA agent is played by Gary Oldman, who brings his incredible skill with villains to the film.After Leon takes her in, Mathilda presses him to teach her to kill so she can exact revenge. As he trains her, the two develop a chemistry that is more convincing than 99 percent of the on-screen relationships I've seen. Mathilda develops a crush on Leon, which flusters the hit-man. Although some critics find this disturbing, the relationship is very much father/child as opposed to Lolita. Still, Portman's performance is so incredible that if you're not careful you'll find yourself actually wanting the relationship to grow. She plays the part with such maturity that you forget her age.The action sequences are very well done and don't get bloated to the point that it's over the top. In fact, the only over the top thing in the movie is Gary Oldman, but he does it in his own special way that makes the part interesting as opposed to unintentionally funny.The extended version of the film is the superior cut, though it suggests that Leon actually could love Mathilda in a sexual way if he had not been heartbroken in his youth.

479,neilperera20,Touching,9,29 January 2003,This is a very stylish action film!! ok this film is not clever or anything but it it does what it needs to do well...which most films often fail to do!!!! the music is emotional and after watching it makes u feel empty and gives u a sudden taste for milk!! I personally thought the cut version was better as it was more succint which makes the film far better paced!! I think one of the charms of the relationship in the cut version was deciding for yourself if they were in love or what!! i liked the fact that it was more open to interpretation!!!bottom line though......an excellent film......... 9/10,Léon - The Professional

And the music was superb along with the cinematography: it is one of those films where every frame is an award winning photograph to hang on the wall.

Even the scene that people slaughter. Matilda's family, this scene zip along. Also, this scene express how they are cruel people, They kill innocent people include child without hesitation. Stanford kills them as like playing a game. This scene is one of my favorite one. It is the first time for me to watch it. I am surprised Natalie Portman, who act Matilda, Her acting ability is so wonderful. I deeply sympathy with her because her acting attracts me. Especially when she is crying I cry too.

It's very beautiful that the fusion of Leon's loneliness and Mathilda's one. Their love is too complicated to tell clearly; its style is different from the love of couple, friend and family.

The hopeful look in his face and the blank, yearning expression betrayed his feelings, but deprived him of his killer instinct -- a pistol followed him, and he did not even know it. Finally, the shot rang out, and the killer died at the end of the dark corridor, one step from the shining door.

I happened to catch this one the other night on a pay channel, and it was right after Matilda's family gets killed. I was immediately glued to it, even though I have seen it a few times before. It is a riveting and suspenseful film, and it scores in all departments. The style and pacing are second to none. Natalie Portman gave us a preview of her brilliance in this film, and she gives an excellent performance that I think would have been Oscar-worthy if the film had received more attention when it was first released. Jean Reno redefines the ruggedly handsome action hero, and he is perfect in the role of Leon. Gary Oldman is over the top, but so is his character, and he nails it all the way. Danny Aiello is solid as usual, and all of the supporting performances are spot on. Director Luc Besson set the standard with this film that others have sadly been unable to achieve. They need to, because it's films like this one that make movie watching the truly rewarding experience that it should be. This is for Matilda!!!",Léon - The Professional

Jean Reno's acting displayed his key to success by being dramatic yet maintaining a sense of masculinity expected by society for a narratives masculine characters.  Gary Oldman is psychotic, a great antagonist who shows that he thinks before he acts. Natalie Portman is wonderful, showing off the talent, potential, and intelligence that she embodies.  Leon's greatest element is the reversal used in the narrative making the hitman an hero and the cops the enemies. the only real problem I have doesn't come from the film, but from what happens to the actors afterward.  Jeno Reno ending up in parts like Rollerball and Natalie Portman acting in star wars.  Not that I have a problem with star wars, yet her acting abilities are seriously restrained for that part.  Leon does have major potential for a sequel which I hear may be in the works but at the same time I can see where it could ruin the narrative if not handled correctly.  Personally, the roots metaphor should be carried over and Mathilda should kill with a knife at the end due to that was proclaimed as the last lesson she would learn to be a real professional.

The only film that tops it for me is The Shawshank Redemption (click my name above to see my review on that) so therefore for me it beats the likes of my other favourites like The Godfather and Schindlers list. One of the main reason this film is so great is because of Natalie Portmans amazing acting in it, she managed to capture angry, suicidal, vengeful side of Mathilda but also the loving more caring side of her, not many grown up actors/actresses can do that let alone a kid.

Unfortunatlely I only saw two minutes of it before the commercial came on and I was angry because I didn't know what the movie was.After I saw the film for the first time I was amazed how far and outlandish some of the characters were (more specifically Mathilda and Stansfield). Natalie Portman smoking, swearing like a truck driver, shooting guns, and drinking at eleven? Now that's a movie. The Professional is more proof that Gary Oldman is a perfect villain (aside from Bram Stoker's Dracula and The Fifth Element). I always did wonder what that pill he took from his pocket briefcase was.I didn't know much about Jean Reno except from his supporting roles in Mission Impossible and Godzilla. This was the role he was born to play. Too bad I can't find any other films where he has the lead role. The chemistry between him and Natalie Portman is what holds the movie together. I found it funny that someone with the profession of killing people for money would be a fan of film musical actor Gene Kelly.

I kind of wish he did, because to me, she was in the way most of this movie.  Still, he did not, and the movie was what it turned out to be.  *SPOILER GONE*Gary Oldman is hilarious!  This guy is never put on a leash.  In every movie I see him in, it's always an outrage personality he seems to portrait.  He's crazy, and that's a good thing.  Keep screamin' Gary, it's good for you. The ending was better but still failed to live up to any possible expectations.  Basically, this movie did not deliver in the way that I hoped.

502,rubenbaeza84,One of my all time favorite Assassin films,10,7 March 2008,"I enjoy horror, I enjoy action, Gangster films, Westerns and I enjoy art-house. One genre I cannot get enough of is Assassin films. A loose genre that derives mostly from action films, on the top of the helm is Leon. Maybe not the greatest action film but a very memorable one that rises in the ranks of action films that stands along with other notable assassin films like John Woo's The Killer, Fallen Angels, Crying Freeman, Nikita, Fulltime killer, collateral, Le Samouraï, Another Lonely hit-man, and Rainy Dog. The Bullets fly and people die in this brutal blood for blood and yet very bizarre love story about a lonely hit-man and a young girl with complex emotions and complicated feelings towards her supposed new guardian. Leon is smooth, tough and very articulate in the art of stealth combat, he uses his skills to kill people and get paid well for it as well. Matidla, young naive and hopeless in a world were everyone seems to turn their backs on her. Living with abusive and neglectful parents, things don't seem to be getting any brighter for Mathilda. Until her family is massacred by a bunch of crooked DEA officers, she is left with only one option, safety in the hands of her mysterious neighbor. Leon wants her to forget, but she only wants revenge for her little brother that got caught in the ambush. Leon reluctantly teaches her the trade of the assassins and even lets her use a sniper rifle on civilians (by only shooting them with paint.) He even brings her on his shifts. Matilda develops feelings for the private Hit-man. Leon wants to part with her but at the same time needs her company in a life were the only people he talks to are the people he'll soon kill. After Matilda makes a failed attempt at getting her killers, its Leon to the rescue. In this beautifully choreographed and well set-up action piece, we see Leon at his prime and most powerful. Even 'Kill Bills' 'the Bride' would be afraid to go one on one with the deadly Leon. It ends with a climatic shoot-out and a literally explosive finale with Leon sacrificing himself for his dear Matilda. This scene is what makes it a powerful action film. Leon is set against the entire police force and the SWAT team. The only thing that will save him are his killing skills. Great music score and powerful and emotional scenes that makes Leon a standout action thriller, I haven't seen a movie that could leave you in goosebumps since John Woo's ""The Killer"" probably the only other action film that can match Leons pure intensity.",Léon - The Professional

505,JessyCritical,Amazing,9,18 November 2010,"Luc Besson, director of La Femme Nikita, introduces us to the kind- hearted assassin Leon, in this tense thriller. After her family is killed by the corrupt Government Official Stansfield (Gary Oldman) the young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is befriended by Leon. Determined to be taught how to 'clean' and desperate to avenge her young brother's death, Mathilda takes on a deadly new life. Leon, played by Jean Reno, is one of those character's you can't help but love. His goofy appearance and quirky behaviour contrast perfectly with his lethal career choice. Despite being unable to read, Leon loves a good film. The scene where he is watching 'Singin' in the Rain' shows us that he just a child inside. Also, during Mathilda's game he is only able to recognise Gene Kelly. Natalie Portman, also, gives a wonderful performance as the 12 year-old Mathilda and it's clear to see why she began to star in other films quite soon after this: Heat, Mars Attacks! etc. Portman has to portray a lot of emotion in this film and she does it with such ease. You instantly feel for her and the situation she's been put in. However, it does become clear that the tough-girl attitude she acquires is just a front, all she wants is to be loved. Perhaps seeking it from a professional assassin, who is a fair bit older than you, is not the best idea; but it is believable and understandable in this film. Gary Oldman as the villain, Stansfield, is brilliant. With lines like, ""I haven't got time for this mickey mouse bullsh*t,"" he was born for roles like this one. His performance is completely believable and you'll love to hate him. He, also, is an odd character: the weird way he takes his pills is nothing short of disturbing. The music used in Leon is another thing that needs applauding. Suspense is easily created and there are many times where you'll want to hold your breath until the scene is over. The soft music adds even more emotion and charm, making the film quite beautiful. So, overall, I really enjoyed this film and could easily watch it again and again. It's another of those films that will stay with you long after you've seen it. Even though it was made 16 years ago, nothing in this genre comes close to being as good.",Léon - The Professional

507,Wilson W,What can I say? Brilliant Movie!,10,20 October 1999,"This is one of my favorite films.  It's action movie that actually moves you.  Director Luc Besson and the star Jean Reno are the French versions of John Woo and Chow Yun Fat or viceversa.  Woo and Besson both have great cinematography in their films, a compelling plot lines, and of course intense action scenes.  Reno and Chow have that onscreen presence and charisma.The movie is about a Italian hitman Leon (Jean Reno) takes a 12 year old girl Mathilda (my favorite actress Natalie Portman) under his wing after her family is killed by a corrupt DEA cops lead by Stansfield (Gary Oldman).What was so compelling is the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. Besson shows Leon's search for light in his life while Mathilda is like Leon's anchor.  Also Leon helping Mathilda cope with her loss and eventually he teaches Mathilda how to be a himan (""cleaner"").Besides the outstanding leads making the movie so rememorable is Gary Oldman's Stansfield. If you thought Oldman was psycho in Besson's ""Fifth Element"" you gonna look him in this movie.  He's just being the favorite onscreen psychopath like Christopher Walken.Okay I think I said enough.  It's a great film.  If you want something that is close to this movie I recommend another favorite of mine, John Woo's ""The Killer"" with just about the same similarities like this film.",Léon - The Professional
508,Serpico-7,A superior thriller,10,27 February 1999,"Leon one of a handful of action movies that works at a level beyond that of explosions and big guns.  Admittedly it has both of these, and is very violent, but it also has a character all of its own.Luc Besson blurs the lines of good and evil, and unlike others  involved in this genre, actually portrays his 'action hero' as human rather than superhuman.  Reno's portrayal of Leon is superb, and is neatly balanced by Gary Oldman's (a bad guy in good guy's shoes).  What really makes the movie special is the relationship between Leon and Matilda (Natalie Portman). Slightly reminiscent, and certainly more effective, than that between De Niro and Foster in Taxi Driver, we see a somewhat disfunctional family unit form.  It is not often that a film can be said to be exciting and deeply touching.The film shows that when European and American cinema collide something extra special is created.",Léon - The Professional
509,psiko,Masterpiece of violent Characterisations and fast action-shooting,10,5 August 1999,"An interview with Anne Parillaud, in the Evening Standard, 24.8.90, it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.This idea continues in Léon. Léon was Besson's first foray into international film production. The similarities, or parallels, between Nikita and Léon are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality, to society, against a background of violence, which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference (we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison.) The only difference is gender.I always found that until obtaining the ""Version Integral"" there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt, by Besson, had an ""offending"" scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it, seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasi-child pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film, and this is what infuriated Besson, is that the film is about pure love. Not sex, which is all the Americans, could see.And so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson's films are, simply, great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson's style with fast action-shooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno's and by far Natalie Portman's best screen performance. To me, Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee, said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy - it is one of his best performances.Stylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson's work. Characters are larger than life. Décors are in excess of realism. Besson's characters lack psychological depth. ""The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar."" Besson's use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson's work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite - arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 10/10, a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films - ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""La Cité des Enfants perdu"".

Fantastic plot, brilliant acting (Portman in particular), great visual shots and decent script mixed in with an action movie that focuses on the relationship between two people of roughly the same mental age.

That kind of acacia, inclusive and symbiotic, is not only love can be summarized. As far as redemption is concerned, it's a celestial reincarnation, or the religious proposition of karma, a killer, who cannot die well, who dies for what he loves, is already perfect. And the audience seems to be able to guess the ending, after all, the end of the movie always conform to the rules of social stability. The film runs through the rootless plant, like a half-life killer, also like a precocious perverse girl, wandering alone, drifting in the edge of society, without roots. They are all people in the dark, but unlike Tony's kind of people, they still haven't given up the last bit of starlight, not completely swallowed up by reality and indifference. End although let a person regret, is also part of the sublimation film, Lyon, wearing masks down the stairs when could have mixed with police out injured, but end up down and Stan, with a nearly 20 years of professional killer is not so easy to die, he is doing this for the help mathilda forget hatred hope she grow up to have a good life, he is not in the live for themselves but a life lived for others!

That alone says a lot.This is one of those movies where the relationship between the characters are the best part of the movie. It touches on themes such as age, love, good and evil and executes them perfectly. The range of emotions these characters show without much dialogue is astounding. Excellent job from everyone involved.",Léon - The Professional
514,Omnipitus,The most complete movie I've ever seen,10,5 June 2002,"Ever since I saw LEON for the first time I've had it on my personal top 3 movie list of all times and genres. Like the summary says; it's got everything :  Action, love, thrills, comedy, tears and much more. But what really makes this movie truly unique is these three things : 1) Really great acting by both Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman (she is simply the coolest!). 2) A plot that is both credible and original, thanks to the creative skills of director Luc Besson, whom I consider no less than a God ! 3) Original Soundtrack by Eric Serra - words fail me. The music really catches the intensity of the film, and adds to it. The last piece that makes LEON complete as a truly great movie experience.Perfection has been achieved at last !",Léon - The Professional
515,sittler,Fantastic story; Incredible action,10,5 September 2002,"I wasn't really looking forward to watching Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" the first time I put it on.  I thought his hit ""La Femme Nikita"" was over-rated.  But after watching the opening scene of ""The Professional"", I gained a new respect for Besson. The movie's central character is Leon (played brilliantly by Jean Reno), a hit-man who runs his professional and personal life with little - if any - emotion. He lives a paranoid existence - he shuffles desperately through crowds in an attempt to remain unnoticed and has his gun nearby when he sleeps, which he does while sitting down.Leon's world changes when he decides to help Mathilda, the 12-year-old girl (Natalie Portman, in her film debut) who lives in the apartment next to him. While out picking up groceries, Mathilda's family is murdered by corrupt DEA agents paying retribution to her drug-dealing father. When she returns, a lookout man is watching the door to her family's apartment but she still manages to see the dead bodies inside.  Pretending to be the neighbour, she walks by the carnage and proceeds to knock on Leon's door and, in one of the most suspenseful scenes in the movie, he decides to let her in.   
Initially, Leon provides little support to the orphan Mathilda but she informs him that since he saved her, she is now his responsibility.  When she discovers that he is a ""cleaner"", she takes this as a sign that she must become his student and will use her newly taught skills to kill Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), the man behind her family's murder. It turns out to be a mutual apprenticeship - he teaches her how to kill and how to be a lady and she teaches him how to read and how to have fun - and they develop a father-daughter-like bond. ""The Professional"" combines a fantastic story-line with incredible action scenes, no mean feat for this particular genre.  Jean Reno and Natalie Portman are so natural together they make the premise of a hit-man training a twelve year-old believable.  My one problem with the movie is Gary Oldman, who chews the scenery so much with his villain role that he almost turns it into a cartoon character.  However, the film is strong enough to overcome Oldman's antics. It's apparent that Besson somewhere other than Hollywood because he doesn't sell out with a perfect ending.  It's gutsy, yet touching. Rent it and you'll see.",Léon - The Professional
516,greybitsdmg,Unforgettable,10,11 November 2009,"When I first watched this film at the cinema, I wasn't aware of IMDb. I've since watched it probably 4 or 5 times, and have recently bought the Directors Cut. Having used IMDb a lot recently, I checked out Leon. It was kind of heart warming, having a great deal of my memories of this movie from the previous 15 years being revisited upon me so eloquently whilst reading the comments.It is a glorious film. One that I've not been able to forget for all the best reasons. I think you could probably choose any sub category art that forms a movie i.e., editing or cinematography, and you'd be hard pushed to find fault. What makes this film Extra Special however, is the emotional 'ballet' taking place throughout the film. My emotions were pretty much assaulted by a gang of joy/sadness/hate/fearful anticipation/love/empathy/shock/horror/hope.It's one of those films.I adored/respected/loved Leon (I still watch nearly every film with Jean Reno in). I fell in love with Matilda. I've watched everyone of Natalie Portman's films since too.I was already a fan of Gary Oldman. This film just added extra glue to that bond. He made a brilliant sociopath, in direct contrast to Leon's (anti-)sociopath. I occasionally feel for a character (or two if it's a great romance), but it's very rare for me to be drawn into three so very different people's intimate lives so easily.It's a shame there are too few films of this calibre.",Léon - The Professional

518,argo0403,High Quality Crime Movie,8,30 September 2013,"Leon is a brutal and veteran hit-man. He meets Mathilda, a young girl, and saves her from bad detectives. But, they kills her family so she lives with Leon. Although he declines her to live and talk with, he gradually becomes kind to her. At the same time, the remnants of the detectives tries to find themThough the story is very simple and there's no surprise, this crime movie compensates for that from brilliant performances by actors such as Jean Reno and Gary Oldman.I think Reno plays two roles in this. First is as a heartless assassin. This part is very cool. Second is as a friend or father of Mathilda. In contrast, this part is heart-warming and his smile is so charming that I can't help laughing.The thing I like in this movie is Oldman's madness. I have very strong impression from Darkknight series, so I can't believe that he plays such a crazy villain and I burst into laughs when his last scene.To be honest, I don't have sympathy with Mathilda so much. I always don't have it with young main character.Even though the last is predictable, it moves me. Good or worse, meeting someone really changes our life.  This is not a masterpiece, but I'm very satisfied and touched by pure love of Leon.",Léon - The Professional
519,delahoc,"A rich experience - at once delightful, sensual and disturbing.",10,5 September 1999,"An unexpected delight when I first caught it. It has so many highlights - the sensitive, imaginative direction, three powerful and moving performances from it's main cast, and a story rich in character, emotion and twists.It took me a moment to get over Mathilda's immediate presence of mind when she returned home - an emotional control and quick thinking well beyond her years. But from then on it didn't look back.I'd seen 'Fifth Element' prior to this, and was blown away by the rich imagery, innovative storylines, and imaginative direction. I thought it a grossly underrated film. But here, Besson really shows his skill. I was hooked from start to finish.Jean Reno, is - as always - a commanding screen presence. His Leon is complex: at times bumbling, intelligent, naive and worldly, yet all the time played with such subtlety. He is so totally believable at all times. A sympathetic character despite his profession, we feel so totally for him that the final moments of the film are strong and lasting.Natalie Portman is a gem. What a find. A maturity of performance well beyond her years, able to evoke whatever emotion is required with conviction and utter believability. So totally sensual at such a young age, one can hardly imagine what we can look forward to in the years to come. This is a tour-de-force performance from a talented actress. I'll be watching out for her ...Gary Oldman once again delivers a stunning performance. No one goes mad like Gary Oldman. The insanity is hypnotic, and yet another faultless performance from this incredibly underrated and under-used actor. hen Jack Nicholson goes mad you can hear it clear across the country. When Gary Oldman goes mad it's a fire that burns from within and consumes you quietly and willingly.I wish there were more films like this.",Léon - The Professional
520,paul_shock,Much more than meets the eye,8,26 July 2000,"The Professional (or Leon), is one of those movies that sounds pretty lame when you describe it.A hitman becomes responsible for a little girl whose family is brutally murdered.  The girl teaches the hitman how to read and write, and generally become more of a loving person, and the two form a bond.Except for, say, the hitman part, it sounds like a Disney movie.  But it's not.  The relationship between Leon and Matilda is not done in a corny way, but instead treated with maturity.  Natalie Portman, who was only thirteen, I believe, when this film was made, is absolutely astonishing in this role. The one scene where Matilda is stretched out on the red bedspread, telling Leon she loves him, reminded me a lot of American Beauty, and the similar lust that Kevin Spacey's character had for Mena Suvari.All in all, a very well-done film.",Léon - The Professional

522,Al_James,"A triumph, however you categorise this movie.",10,27 August 2001,"*WARNING, a few minor SPOILERS* I have heard this film categorised in many ways. Some call it a romance, some call it an action movie, some call it a drama.However, you can slice it into each genre, and this film still deserves equal recognition for all three. As a romance, this is heartwrenching and slightly bizarre. As an action movie, this has all the correct elements; stunning stunts, a solid hero, a determined prodege and an evil villain. And as a drama, this film shows artistic flair, offers interesting, developed characters and uses music and lighting to heighten emotion.It is my conclusion then, that this movie need not be categorised. It should simply be realised as one of the finest films ever made.
I have always considered Luc Besson to be one of the most flamboyant directors of the nineties. He is a blessing upon European cinema, and here is allowed to use lighting, sound, camera work and the cast itself to astonishing effect.The lighting in this movie is so important. From the first action sequence, where Leon emerges from the shadows to threaten a cowardly drug runner, to the final sequence in which Nathalie Portman plants his tree under a yellowy orange hue. Each scene is filled with colour (or darkness) that accentuates or deafens the action.The sound is stunning also. From Leon's subtle mumbles, to the chaotic explosion and gunfight sequences. again the sounds serve as a real emphasis on the emotion or action in the film. Just watch the sequence where Stansfield storms the house with his men. It transforms from silence to deafening gunshot fire in seconds.Camera work and editing are something that Besson is magically skilled with. Somehow he knows when to cut a scene, when to let the action unfold and when to use a little editing technique just to keep you guessing what's gonna happen next. There are a number of revealing close-ups in the movie (where Leon backs out of killing Mathilda), yet there are sequences that will blow you away when considering editing. The final action sequence; the laser sighting on SWAT teams rifles, Leon fighting off Agent after Agent and the climactic rally down the stairs posed as a SWAT leader himself. I'm giving away that final battle, I don't mean to. But you will feel like you are part of that gunfight yourself. You will either want to get in there and help Leon out, or you will cower in a corner in the same way as Mathilda.And the cast, oh the cast. Besson can obviously get the best out of Jean Reno, he already has in 'The Big Blue'. And Reno is at his mumbling Euro/American best here! It's no coincidence that Reno hasn't stood out since he moved on to Hollywood. He probably needs a director of Bessons artistic class to get such a good performance from him.
Gary Oldman relishes his villainous Norman Stansfield. His accent is flawless as ever, and he gets exactly the right amount of screen time. Oldman also has some barnstorming sequences of dialogue. ""You don't like Beethoven. You don't know what you're missing....."" But best of all, Oldman is EVIL. He has no standards. He is not discriminative about who lives and who dies, and he is completely motivated by self-gain.To summarise, this movie is sheer artistic class. In every nook and cranny you find elements that make a film a classic. Wether this film has gained enough recognition to stand the test of time I don't know, ask me in twenty years and I hope I answer......yes.",Léon - The Professional
523,LilyRFox,A Fantastic Film with a Tremendous Cast,10,21 July 2008,"'Leon' is the story of a professional hit-man living in New York city who is faced, one day, with the prospect of helping a young girl escape a corrupt police cop who has hurt her family.The story is very much focused around the relationship between Leon (Jean Reno) and his new charge Mathilda (Natalie Portman). The odd relationship between the loner hit-man and the 12 year old girl he harbours is the most intriguing aspect of the film; although riddled with the suggestion of a strange, oddly adult relationship between the pair the viewer never feels in any way repulsed by what turns out to be a touching coupling. Perhaps that is because of the character of Mathila, a strong commanding young role played fantastically by a young Natalie Portman. The balance in her strength and Leon's vulnerability despite his profession gives this film an emotional depth it could easily have lacked.The second thing which makes this movie brilliant is the amazing Gary Oldman; his performance in 'Leon' will be remembered as one of his best, and is certainly his best to date in my opinion. Chilling as the cold, corrupted city cop, gun-happy and utterly irredeemable, Oldman presents a true psychopath.And it is all, of course, shot with seemingly effortless style and a great tense atmosphere by the wonderful Luc Besson (Nikita, Angel A, The Fifth Element, Joan of Arc and The Big Blue).'Leon' is something truly unique; an action film that has intensity, a genuinely thrilling villain, a touching hero and earnest emotional depth.

The juxtapositions of what assassins should be concerned with, what little girls should be protected from, what evil men do to create chaos in this world, . . . Too many well-thought out interactions between characters to do the film justice with descriptive words. If you do not experience vile anger, compassion for killers, heart-felt paternal wishes to whisk this child from adult evil or the need to cheer ruthless revenge without guilt, then you are simply not human. The depth and presentation of these characters by excellent, superb acting is only overshadowed by the writing of this masterpiece.",Léon - The Professional
525,John Doe 316,My All-Time Favourite Movie,10,22 February 2002,"Leon is an absolutely fantastic movie.  With a fantastic storyline and a stellar cast, this movie is unmissable!The plot centres around a young girl called Matilda (Natalie Portman) who comes home to find her family have all been murdered by corrupt government agent Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and is forced to seek help from Leon (Jean Reno)who happens to be a professional hitman.  A strong bond develops between Matilda and Leon, and continues to build right up to the film's stunning climax.Jean Reno gives the best performance of his career as Leon, showing how, while on the job, he is an emotionless killer, but has a gentle side.  This is characterised by how he watches ""Singin' In The Rain"" with childlike wonder, how he constantly spits his milk all over the place like a buffoon and, most of all, his love for Matilda.Forget Star Wars, Portman's career-best role is right here as Matilda. While at times you can really empathise with her, there's also times when you want to strangle her.  The story is mainly seen through her eyes, so we learn a lot about her complex character.Gary Oldman is my favourite actor, and I have to say that this is, you guessed it, his best performance.  In my opinion, Norman Stansfield is right up there with the likes of Hans Gruber from ""Die Hard"" as one of cinema's greatest bad guys.  From impulsive pill-popping to emptying barrel-loads of bullets into a guy when three will do (""But he ruined my suit!"") Oldman manages to steal the show.***SPOILERS*** So what if the movie isn't exactly totally realistic?  Who cares if one man couldn't REALLY take out an entire police force?  Haven't any of you critics heard of suspension of disbelief?  Oh, and by the way, no, Matilda having a crush on Leon is not ""sick"" so, in the words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, SHADDAP! ***END SPOILERS***It may not be the best movie I've ever seen, but its certainly the most enjoyable - 10/10, and that doesn't do it justice!",Léon - The Professional

527,khangfuzhun,"Beautifully crafted film, Portman and Reno were brilliant....",10,7 May 2005,"It's rare to find a film that combines action with beautiful chemistry between characters. Yes, it is extremely rare...especially when your world is nothing but chock full of Hollywood over-dos and special effects that deliver nothing but wear-n-tear to film. That's why when you come across such a film with none of the outlandish buzz, and instead is filled with a larger-than-life plot and interaction, it becomes the ""it"" in your list. I have something to say about those who find this film perverse, pertaining to the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. Yes, we're in a country dancing with skimpy excess, parading around our television sets and in our heads. This is a drama about finding a person who has become that personal attachment in your life and how it's become important enough to risk your life over, not a preteen exploitation on the psyche. This film deserves respect, and taking it for an exploit film is just utter disrespect. Anyways, for Portman's debut as an actress, she was brilliant. She's breezed through what I thought was an ""extremely"" difficult role to pull off; a distraught and abused 12-year-old girl to step into a hit-man's life and fall in love with him. Reno also gets equal credits in playing off a chemistry development between the 2; a lonely hit-man who's been brushed off without love, and slowly but surely, as a stiff, falling in love with her lively exuberance and her attachment to him. And Oldman portrayed a psycho very deeply, induced by drugs of the very same profession he's supposed to be up against. All in all, it was an amazingly rich film. It deserves so much more than just being a part of the Blockbuster back row, like an Oscar per-say. But sadly, it hasn't acclaimed anymore in America than just that. Seriously, watch this movie. Just don't expect it to be this big action movie, because it really isn't, though it has its few slick moments. I prefer to call it a relationship drama, which it really is. If you watch it with an open mind, you'll become attached to the protagonists yourself. It leaves an effect on you that you can't and don't want to get rid of; simply profound, sentimentally driven, and unusually realistic interactions. I have enjoyed and loved this film.

U.,1,23 December 2002,"Are any of us happy we responded so enthusiastically to La Femme Nikita that we now have to sit through shiny garbage like The Fifth Element and the Professional?  Wow, this movie's stupid.  The movie begins attempting no nonsense-realism by choosing gritty, not picturesque parts of the city, as well as chucking in the pretty gratuitous murder of a child to make it that much more ""edgy"", and then the movie just becomes an orgy of gun-worship and impersonal murder, strung together by a silly, yet sickening plot, where this mass murderer's (Leon) really kind of cute and avuncular when babysitting this heavily made up 12 year old.  Hey, he drinks milk!  How bad could he be?  And he refuses to shoot women and children!  What a guy!  I, being an adult male, he would happily kill given the business opportunity, but serves me right for not being a woman or child.  In the course of the plot he teaches this alarmingly sophisticated neighbor girl how to be like him, how to kill strangers.   Ahhh.  The ""lessons"" he offers her, the tricks of his trade are chestnuts you'd  never ever think of like, ""relax.  keep your eye on him.""  I would have thought panic and look away, so shows what I know!  And not like I'm mister puritanical, but something quite pronouncedly creepy is at least SUPPOSED to be going on in this film, I have never seen a child quite so ""advertised"" which is an extremely sleazy thing to be half-heartedly suggesting in your half-baked movie about the lovable hitman and orphan annie who likes to sing ""Like A Virgin"" and dress up as Marilyn Monroe.  Which reminds me--the abysmal humor that appears throughout the film, is that like a trademark with this guy?  ""The Fifth Element"" had an equally annoying cute streak.  Lastly, if you really watch Jean Reno, forgetting he's French and interesting looking, his performance is pretty rank amateur.  He really looks even more lost than the lovable murdering dope he's supposed to be playing.  They also refer to him in the film as Italian, which he's clearly French.  Does the French director not know what French accents sound like?

But it is really a love story  with great action on the side.  Leon is an extraordinary movie shot in New York about a quiet professional cleaner (played wonderfully by Jean Reno) who comes to live with a young girl whos family was killed by a corrupt DEA team.  Mathilda wants to learn to become a cleaner so she can take revenge on Stansfield(Gary Oldman) Leon is not too excited about the idea but soon realizes that there is no way out.  The movie explores how close the relationship with Leon and Mathilda gets and how they handle each other.

What really stands out for me (aside from the really excellent direction of the action sequences) is the too-brilliant for its own good script. Oldman,Reno, and Portman deliver lines that would seem goofy if spoken by lesser performers. Oldman especially chews the scenery in a way that's both amusing and utterly menacing. I wonder if his Beethoven obsession is a nod to the ultra-violent Alex from A Clockwork Orange?The American version (""The Professional"") was the first version I saw. I'd originally had no real intention of seeing it because I'd read a pretty savage review of it likening it to child pornography. Clearly this particular reviewer had his head firmly planted in his rear. I'm surprised he could find room what with that tremendous stick in the way. Anyway, once I finally saw ""Leon"" for myself - thanks to my cinemaphile grandfather - I observed no such thing. This wasn't smut, it was love. Leon has no interest in Matilda sexually, but loves her as a father would love a daughter.If you have a choice then go for the longer director's cut. You get about 15 minutes more film - and not just filler. These are scenes that truly expand upon the story.My only complaints are about the almost complete under use of the completely underrated Danny Aiello, and Oldman's single dimensional evilness.",Léon - The Professional
537,stevielanding,"Good Action, but too flawed to be a classic",8,7 March 2018,"I don't know what everybody is gushing about. It's a nice action movie, but has improbable to impossible scenes just to move along the movie. The dress-up game to help the memory is a good one. They live in squalor. They have nothing. Yet the kid has no trouble going into the bedroom and putting on expensive clothes so she can pretend to be a celebrity. The guy is supposed to be a hitman, yet he allows the girl to ""practice"" on the rooftop of their apartment building which, of course, would draw a ton of attention. He kills for a living, but he allows his boss to keep the money? Really? He hangs straight down from above the apartment doorway to fire on the cops and then bends backwards and upwards to escape. His legs would have to be in the hallway to do that move. He escapes by pretending to be one of the cops. Sure, this same ploy has worked in many many other movies, but only because directors seem to think that cops don't know the people they work with.There are easy ways to overcome all of these faults. Basically, I think they took the first idea to come to mind. The kid could have acted like the star/actress without magically having these outfits available in her bedroom. They could have practiced firing in the country, at a range, at a paint ball park, etc. Instead they chose to draw attention to themselves by doing it on the roof. They shot at cops, and somehow the cops didn't come to investigate. They could have had some sort of apparatus at the door so he could do his upside down shooting, but nothing helpful was on or near the door. He could have escaped in any number of ways, but pretending to be a cop in the middle of a bunch of cops is plain stupid.There were more glaring deficiencies. The ones I wrote about were just the ones that popped to mind as I typed. Nice action, but really flawed. I give it 8 stars for the action and nothing for the Lolita angle. It wasn't deep. It wasn't insightful. And it sure as heck wasn't necessary to the movie.",Léon - The Professional
538,pvivek-371-866361,Touches You,10,20 July 2013,"If a movie can touch you so deeply, you got to give it a 10. When someone tries to play an innocent character in a movie, I don't believe they can do it so well unless they are really a bit innocent. And hence my belief that the guy who plays Leon is somewhat of a Leon in reality as well and Mathilda does a carry a bit of Mathilda in her beyond the silver screen.It is an emotional journey of two characters. The plot, the story has absolutely nothing special to it. Its all about the characters and how they make you believe in the things they believe in. It is a performances centric movie and here are two performances in the history of cinema that are not to be missed.Leon just marginally hovers on looking like being retarded but does a fine job of staying away from that zone safely in the end. It is his personality, his love that sets him so far apart from the rest of us. A bit more could have been done to prove his ""professional"" credentials, but I guess that is all they could in the early 1990s. The movie has immense potential for action that should be fulfilled in a remake. Oh wait, a remake has been attempted in Hindi in a movie called Bichchoo, starring Bollywood's very own Bobby Deol and Rani Mukherjee. Once you see Leon you will laugh your a** out watching Bichchoo. In fact, I think the guys would have been better off making Bichchoo as a true parody like Scary Movie or somethingThen there is Mathilda enacted by Natalie Portman in her debut movie. She is 12 and has the emotional leanings of an 18 year old. Her falling in ""love"" with a seemingly 40ish Leon is awkward, at least to eastern sensibilities. But no concession has been given to her age in showing her love and hatred and for that you have to hand it out to the makers.All in all, a great GREAT emotional drama. It is NOT an action flick or a thriller. So set your expectations right.",Léon - The Professional
539,angrykirby,BAD movie watch something else,1,13 July 2004,"Leon/the professional is unoriginal, badly shot and just a terrible action movie. Anyone who liked this must be out of touch with what a good movie is.Leon/the professional should NOT be rated higher than The Man With No Name trilogy, Yojimbo, the killer, desperado, THE Terminator trilogy and other movies that are painfully more awesome then this is. This movie is unoriginal, full of stereotypical characters and old, man has to deal with little girl, not fitting his life style, with hilarious results and love Plot line. The movie also has a sense of humor that does not fit the feel of the movie.The action is unmemorable and laughable. ""WHAT? an entire swat team and not one throws a smoke grenade or teargas bulls***"" -thats me screaming at the fake stillted ""action"" in a later scene. The bad guys also look so overly menacing they're funny. The main bad guy wears all white and reminds me of Moco from El Meriache except Moco was cool.I don't have enough space to say all the reasons why I hate mediocre action films like this, they make the genre worse. This movie also bothered me because it is badly edited with useless segments, a boring overall feel and no story arc. It looks like it was made by pedophiles because they put that little girl in every sexual look they could. It makes you feel sickened. If you liked it please watch the movies I mentioned during this review. Then you will understand. Bottom line: mediocre films like this with lame dialog, LAME action, bad acting, no message/point and nothing new weaken the action genre!",Léon - The Professional
540,francpsantos,Would say it's one of the best. But it is still damn good,8,7 December 2018,"I fell like there is really not much to say about this movie. It has its ups and downs and I am not sure if it deserves all the praise that has been going around, but it is still a consistent good movie. It poses an interesting story and a different take at an action movie, in a decade when bad, over the top action movies were the thing. The performances are overall good, especially Jean Reno, as the ruthless assassin fatherly loving figure, and Natalie Portman, the character that we sometimes forget is a child. Gary Oldman gives all his heart, but his performance can only be as good as the one-dimensional villain he is portraying.
The story is, on one hand, well designed and different, specially the constant efforts of Léon to adapt to his new role of caretaker. Mathilda's constant uncomfortable approaches make it even better and are the clear result of a way too brief and dysfunctional childhood. On the other hand, it still falls sometimes into the predictability of the typical 'redemption arc' formula.
Overall a refreshing approach to the genre, with smart use of action and an engaging plot.",Léon - The Professional

It successfully blends action, drama, thriller (...you name it) together.It's masterfully directed by Luc Besson. Besson proves that you don't need a big budget to make a really good movie. Everything from the camera angles to the close to face camera focus scenes such as Mathilda's face illuminating as the door opens and the white flash at the end is simply awesome!Also the Musical score and soundtrack such as Sting and Björk is again very well chosen and fits the movie completely! The movie also contains one of my favorite movie scenes of all time... The bathroom scene with Gary Oldman... Gosh it's a treat to watch that guy act!The acting Trio in Reno, Portman, and Oldman absolutely smokes! 'Nuff said. Probably one of the best I've ever seen in a movie.

Unfortunately it was also the same director who did the ""Fifth Element"" which goes to show that ""Nikita"" was a creative fluke.
    I am sorry, I just could not buy the premise.  When you cannot buy the story from the first 15 minutes, then the whole movie is lost.   One more thing, can we nominate Gary Oldman for the ""Overacting Hall of Fame"".  Between this and ""Fifth Element"" he shows just how much a waste of talent he really is.

The contrast between violent action and touching, characterising interaction between the leads and corrupt DEA is great it is a film everyone should watch a classy piece of film which felt like it actually had a message, rather than a Tarantino style flick (which i like).

546,Alex_Priest,"Luc Besson managed to do sthg unachievable:To Create a Movie for all kinds of Movie Fans,Leon...",10,11 April 2006,"This Movie is GREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAATTTTTT!!!!!!!Luc Besson(the director and screenwriter of Leon,as long as other successful movies)did a miracle by creating this movie...Movies like this are Rare and maybe it doesn't exist yet one movie that can be matched to Leon. Every kind of movie fan will like it,I can guarantee that(maybe only small kids wouldn't like it as they wouldn't like the violence and they wouldn't understand the emotional part of the movie).-Action film fans will love it for for Jean Reno's great stunts in the beginning,but especially in the end.Just for you to understand the quality of the stunts,they were so well executed that at the same time they seemed like they were taken from a modern action film,without Leon doing something impossible.I had never seen a movie where a single man goes against an army of armed guys portrayed in such a believable way,I mean...even the holes in the story have been covered:Jean Reno didn't learn to fight an army of men in the last half hour of the movie,but he plays one of the best assassins that ever existed,so it's normal what he did.Plus the movie shows us that Leon(Jean Reno) even though was very well trained and without emotions,was also vulnerable to bullets and human,something that we see in the wounds he takes in some scenes(I won't continue,I don't want to spoil the movie to you).-As for emotional types this movie is again great:The story of Love(and when I say love I mean Father to Daughter Love,even though Matilda/Natalie Portman was a bit further than this point-don't misunderstand me)that is slowly formed between Leon and Matilda is great,as it doesn't happen immediately(in a scene from the beginning Leon tries to shoot Matilda in her sleep,but in the end he can't make it...oooops sorry I won't speak anymore of the movie),but slowly and in the way it would happen if this story was real.It will show them how two different strangers will learn to love and feel compassion for each other...some of them may even cry a bit.-And in the end,fans of comedies/adventure movies will also like it because it also shows some funny jokes once in a while(but don't expect Jim Carrey/Ben Stiler jokes). This movie will surely keep everyone seated in front of the screen without even going once to take a glass of water or peeing... The characters were also great: -Gary Oldman perfectly plays the role of a corrupted psycho cop who loves Beethoven,-Natalie Portman makes us really believe that she is a just a small and weak girl,but that wants to learn from Leon how to kill in order to avenge the murder of her little Brother,but also generally to give justice to all bad people,-But the star of the show was....JEAN RENO!!!In this movie he is brilliant,I don't know if they gave him an Oscar or another award,but he surely deserved it.The way he shows us his two sides:the side of the ruthless assassin and the side of the lonely man who enjoys some company,is awesome.It is clearly showed that every man has a heart and that in the most particular moment he can change,take away from his face his cold mask and start showing his emotions. To conclude,I suggest every movie fan to watch this movie,they will love it.I hope that my comment also helped those who didn't understand it's power(no offense).

Young Natalie Portman did a good acting job as well as Jean Reno, but they weren't spectacular per se. It simply wasn't super engaging or riveting. I guess the action sequences were cool and there were times when the movie was quite sweet and heartwarming, but the ending was like, meh. Not particularly sad or emotional. So I give it a 5 out of 10.",Léon - The Professional
549,adamhart-1,An exhilerating motion picture that delivers pure emotion.,10,8 December 2001,"From the opening musical score, which is phenomenal throughout the entire Film, Luc Besson gives us one of the most stylish Character introductions seen to date.  The Cinematography is outstanding as the camera focuses on Leon (Jean Reno) and his Italian Mob friend (Danny Aiello), with subtle shots, that pan onto his dark sunglasses or the glass of milk he's drinking (which actually becomes a running theme).Almost as soon as we are introduced to the seemingly cold, calculating Leon, the heat is on and we discover that he is an unstoppable, untouchable and lethal as a professional hitman.  The way in which he displays his expertise, is visually spectacular as he kills people one by one, appealing to all fans of Action, Gore and Suspense.  It is also gripping to see Leon hunt down the last remaining 'client', making the vulnerable man sweat with fear and me be riveted to my seat in anticipation.
As the gloriously original plot continues, Leon rescues a 12 year old girl called Mathilda (Natalie Portman) from iminant death, which begins an awe inspiring relationship between the two.  It's very rare to see such impressive characterisation in a Film and Besson manages to reveal the warmer, caring side to Leon, without clouding the presence of a ruthless and fearless killer.  Without sounding too 'soppy' it has to be said that their relationship and love for each other is beautiful and is always accompanied by the captivating score.Apart from the skilled and apparant capability of Reno....Portman's portrayal of Mathilda really is atonishingly authentic.  Albeit the stars of this Film are obvious but without Gary Oldman's performance, the film would have lacked the depth and tension that is so essential to the plotline. Oldman plays a crooked, psychopathic Drug Enforcement Agent, who is significantly agitated by Leon's diligent trail of death and destruction. The scenes in which his anxiety is at it's most extreme, commands your attention and is a pleasure to watch.It is a meritorious accomplishment for a Film of this genre to have such a rich plot and character development.  The transition of Leon, devoid of any feelings, to him embracing Mathilda's affections is a paramount example. There is a strong universal appeal to all movie-lovers for this extraordinary Film and it is totally justified.I personally found it a delight to watch and am sure that Leon is one of the only Films I can watch repeatedly, without the danger of becoming dissatisfied.If the rumours about a sequel to Leon are true, then expect another superb, stylish, Action-Thriller...that will be damn near close to being perfect.",Léon - The Professional
550,SirEmu,About Jean Reno and making the audience Relax,10,12 May 2020,"According to Jean Reno, he decided to play Léon as if he were ""a little mentally slow"" and emotionally repressed. He felt that this would make audiences relax and realize that he wasn't someone who would take advantage of a vulnerable young girl. Reno claims that for Léon, the possibility of a physical relationship with Mathilda is not even conceivable, and as such, during the scenes when such a relationship is discussed, Reno very much allowed Portman to be emotionally in control of the scenes.Allright ..The Track from Bjork - Venus as a Boy ...

551,phattdirty,Luc Besson's Leon: A Review,9,12 December 2005,"Luc Besson follows up his explosive international success La Femme Nikita with another story about assassins and the resulting film is even better than his previous effort. From its super-stylish beginninga directorial trademarkwe know we are in for a full-on cinematic experience. From the word go we have stunning action set pieces combined with some genuinely touching and funny scenes as well as sharp dialogue but what makes this film so special is the on-screen chemistry of its two leads. Jean Reno as the soft-spokenand somewhat naïvebut deadly French hit-man and Natalie Portman as the ballsy pre-teen determined to seek revenge on the psychotic cop who killed her family. There are plenty of humorous moments in this incredible film and some memorable one-liners including: ""Somebody's coming up somebody serious"". The underlying Lolita-style storyline is sometimes uncomfortable but strangely compelling and never gratuitous. Matilda sees Leon as a father-figure and he feels duty bound to protect her, however as the relationship becomes stronger Matilda confuses her feelings for something more sexualleaving Leon gob smacked and ultimately getting them evicted from their hotel.No can deny that this is an action film but whereas something like Die Hard relies on a basic premise and lots of explosions, Leon manages to fuse Hollywood's obsessions for all things pyrotechnic with a proper story and excellent script. Like all good action films there must be a bad guy and in Gary Oldman's Stansfield we have the epitome of bad. He is so downright nasty that he makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like the Fairy Godmother. It is never explained what pills he is constantly swallowing or why he must make such melodramatic actions in order to swallow them and this makes his character even more menacing. He is murderous, unpredictable and unhinged and not even his classical music obsession can calm him into any kind of rational thought. Gary Oldman, often typecast as the bad guy, shows us once again that he is an incredibly versatile and brilliant actor and it's a great travesty that he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his performance.The complete lack of recognition this film received at the time of release is astounding with only the Japanese Academy, Czech Lions and César Awards nominating it for prizes. Since then however its reputation has grown and Leon is now recognised as a true masterpiece of modern cinema and its director Luc Besson regarded as one of the most exiting talents to come out of Europe since the French New Wave. Not before or since has an action film had such a massive impact on its audience and with its reputation amongst film fans still growing one can only imagine in how much esteem it will be regarded by future generations.",Léon - The Professional
552,pickleinabag,The gem that everyone forgets!,9,21 November 2019,"First and foremost, if you haven't seen this movie, go watch it now. You will not be disappointed. Its one of the best hitman movies ever made and definitely up there with the top action thrillers of the 90's. I won't spend too much time getting into the smaller details of what makes this a classic. Where would I start anyway? Natalie Portman is excellent in this as a kid and that isn't something that typically happens. Jean Reno is at the top of his game and this will arguably be the best movie he has ever done. Gary Oldman portrays arguably the best villain of his career. He is great as a villain, but this one sticks out more than the rest. The script is excellent and it allows you to get invested in the characters and empathize with their situations. This movie will definitely challenge you on a moral level as well. I can't really tell you too much that the synopsis doesn't already tell you about the plot, but I will say this has one of the best action sequences I have ever seen at the end of the movie. Its a tragedy that The Professional isn't more popular than it is. Enemy of the State is a little underrated as well.",Léon - The Professional
553,dnjjr,"Character-Driven, Action-Packed Besson - Incredible",9,14 March 2006,"N.B. Spoilers within. Part action/thriller, part character study, ""Leon (The Professional)"" is a sure-fire bet for lovers of both categories. The story is about the meticulous hit-man and determined loner Leon (an amazing Jean Reno) and the precocious 12-year-old Mathilda (the equally amazing Natalie Portman) who crashes his party. They are vastly different from each other, separated not just by wide gaps in age, culture, and experience, but by their basic psychologies. Leon runs a strictly one-man show by sheer will and by necessity: it allows him to survive and flourish. But as bottled up as he is, he is marked by tragedy and sorrow. These feelings he keeps tightly compartmentalized, which makes him so successful as a killing machine. Enter Mathilda, the product of a wholly dysfunctional home, where she was regularly beaten and abused by her drug-dealing father and loveless family. Despite this, she is by nature a strong, hopeful, and highly intuitive girl. The movie throws these two together and lovingly documents their emotional journey toward each other. All of this is skillfully woven with Leon's violent line of work, providing the film with some spectacular action sequences. It gets even better when the savvy Mathilda joins Leon on the job, giving her a sense of purpose while forcing Leon to join the human race, or at least one headstrong member of it. The movie really succeeds when it goes deeply into the emotions driving each character. Mathilda, after all, is just discovering love and sexuality, which she presses on Leon, the object of her newfound desires. As for him, Leon can barely stand this nuisance at first, but gradually becomes the caring father figure she never had. The more she gets under his skin, the harder he looks into himself to do the right thing for her. This whole process becomes incredibly touching. You root for these two oddballs; they flesh out a unique love story.Meanwhile, Leon and Mathilda are up against one of the stranger villains of the 90s, the malicious D.E.A. agent Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman: he scores again). Stansfield is also an oddball: he is outrageously high-strung (always being pampered and brought back to reality by his fellow nasties), he pops weird pills, and rambles on about Beethoven to his soon-to-be-dispatched victims. In any case, he is a creepy, ruthless dude. Besson keeps the tension high for much of the film, letting go only long enough for the occasional scene where Leon and Mathilda have some time alone. (The two actors really shine here.) Otherwise, the film has a running undercurrent of menace and unpredictability. Compassion and cruelty weave continually in and out. The film's climax is gripping, and the do-or-die moment when Leon and Mathilda say goodbye is positively heart-wrenching. The two have come a very long way. A good word should be put in, too, for the always dependable Danny Aiello as Tony, Leon's boss and a father figure himself. This is a smart, highly enjoyable film  tight, focused, and personal. It's a rush for the senses and a gratifying story of memorable characters.",Léon - The Professional

A fantastic script with many memorable quotes; perfect, stand out performances from all star including Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman and Danny Aeilo;
humour when needed which can either make a chuckle of straight up belly laugh and even eye catching cinematography.I was this film when I was a young teen but it didn't change my view in the film, of course it's violent and very bleak sometimes but it's not that kind of gore and violence that changes the mood and makes it less enjoyable to watch. I think this film can't be topped. A tragedy that this film didn't even score an Oscar, Golden Globe or BAFTA nomination because I think it deserved to be up there with the greats even it was the year of Pulp Fiction, Forest Gump and the Shawshank Redemption.

Matilda's fate is almost met when a very crooked DEA Agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman) murders her family while she is out buying milk - Leon saves her life and teaches her the trade of ""cleaning"". I bought this film before I had even seen it. I did this because of the fantastic reviews it got, and having a real respect for Gary Oldman. When I fired it up the first time... it all suddenly made sense.The real story behind Leon isn't the gun play, (which is still fantastic) but the relationship between mature well mannered Leon and sexually inexperienced and unsure, but outgoing Matilda. The chemistry between the two on screen is just fantastic, as Leon starts to come to terms with himself that he really is in love with Matilda. Pedhophila is an issue in this film (though is never shown) and is understandable why some people find it to be a hard pill to swallow (maybe not for Oldman)... but for me, this film is like taking a trip down a road of rocky revenge, heartbreaking tragedy, breathtaking style and substance to die for.

564,Exile-Inc,Stunning Movie Surprisingly Overlooked,10,5 June 2004,"I'm honestly surprised that this film isn't more well-known that it is, for it is honestly an incredible and well-done movie.Jean Reno is a ""Cleaner"" - a graceful and smooth hitman employed with the Italian mafia. Natalie Portman is a young girl from an abusive household that comes home to find her family murdered and enters Reno's life seeking both sanctuary and revenge. Upon learning what Reno really does for a living, Portman encourages him to teach her the ways of being a professional assassin, and starts her studies under the hands-on teaching of Reno.Surprisingly enough, there is much, much more to this film than the simple misgivings and actions of a hitman who is forced to care for a young girl. Despite its obvious violent backdrop, the film not only chronicles her growth in his art, but also the bond and relationship that comes between them, not only as adult and child but also as father and daughter.Natalie Portman only seeks to be cared for while Jean Reno finds his love hard to give, finally culminating in the ultimate sacrifices being paid for each other - sacrifices which only love could bring about.The acting is done superbly, with Leon's childlike wonder amidst his very mature profession being played to a T by an incredibly under-rated actor Jean Reno. And Mathilda's child-like habits, yet her adult maturity being performed amazingly by an only 13 year old Natalie Portman, this film definitely is a must see, not only for the superb craftsmanship of Luc Besson, but also for the heart-felt story and its ""star-crossed"" love between the characters themselves.With support acting from Danny Aiello and Gary Oldman, this well-done film doesn't receive its due enough, in a time when films have lost what quality such films like these had.",Léon - The Professional

566,habib_khodadad,Riveting plot and action packed,10,7 July 2018,"There are enough gun slinging scenes here to somewhat satisfy the average joe who fiends for action, but this movie doesn't use just senseless violence to push the plot forward. Life as a killer and as a child rendezvouz here unexpectedly, an inveterate killer and a child who resembles a sacred innocence meeting each other to form an unlikely relationship. The child's life has already been tainted with violence and subsequent tragedies, but the killer father figure tries to shield her eyes from any further damage. The killer plays an emotionless man who preys on those who have rubbed people the wrong way. He is the archangel and the death angel, holding the dual responsibility of keeping peace in the child's life and also going about his normal routine of dispatching his foes. The child is a girl named Mathilda, played by Natalie Portman, and she is a symbol of a childhood robbed of its idyllic backdrop, and changed forever by a Landscape of apathy and violence. Her life begins to take a chaotic turns as she accepts the protection of Leon, an emotionless killer who performs his tasks like a robot but is determined to protect the child from harm. Realizing that the child's life has already been contorted by her exposure to violence and tragedies, he only hopes to amends by protecting her from any more harm.",Léon - The Professional
567,tot92078,"Worth adding to ""To Watch"" list, but not amazing",7,27 February 2011,"SPOILER ALERT!Overall, The Professional was a good watch. I was particularly impressed by Natalie Portman's acting - especially considering it was her first major on-screen appearance. I also liked how it wasn't necessarily a happy ending - Leon dies at the hands of the main antagonist.The characters were a bit exaggerated, especially the main antagonist.The plot moved along at a decent speed, as there were minimal lull. The actions scenes, however, bordered on unbelievable. It's better than Rambo-style shooting scenes, but it is a bit ridiculous that Leon could take on so many enemies at once.I did not like the ""romance"" between Mathilda and Leon - or, at least, how Mathilda thought that she was in love in Leon. Really weird. Not sure what it added to the movie.",Léon - The Professional

569,findmyself27,Wonderfully offbeat film!,8,2 July 2017,"Luc Besson has made a name for himself making films with offbeat story lines and characters; and this one is an addition to his list of memorable films. Wonderfully cast and beautifully shot, The Professional is a film that keeps the audience on it's toes from opening credits til ""The End"". Gary Oldman shines as the deliciously nutty dirty cop Stansfield, and there is good reason as to why this is one of his more famous roles. With over the top delivery in such lines as ""EVERYONE!"" it's impossible to take your eyes off of Oldman. Jean Reno is also someone you refuse not to watch. His character's ruthless ability to kill, colored by his childish innocence despite his career as a hired killer make him lovable and sympathetic. And the heartbreaking performance from the wonderful Natalie Portman as the confused and older than her years Mathilda, who is orphaned by the murderous Stansfield and is driven by a thirst for revenge; makes your heart stop, and the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. Though full of course language and lots of blood, the film is an enjoyable one; and a must see for Reno, Portman and Oldman fans everywhere.",Léon - The Professional

The ending is one of the best I have seen for a long time due to its unpredictable plot.  At first glane, the plot may seem stupid, b but actually works well with me.

The end is not the one she predicted though.Jean Reno was brilliant, no-one could have done better. Same story for Natalie Portman - she had a tough role but did a great job using her incredible style.Finally, the soundtrack is brilliant and this makes the movie absolutely perfect : 10/10.",Léon - The Professional
576,Insincere Dave,A shameful praise of a fantastic film.,10,21 December 1999,"Leon (Jean Reno) is a tortured soul. He lives in squalor and misery, never truly happy or at peace with himself. After all, he is a hitman. He lives quietly from kill to kill, harming no-one whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic, childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is Leon's neighbour. A young girl, she lives with her father, step-mother, half-sister and half-brother. As unhappy as Leon, she lives in awe of the dark stranger, unaware of his true profession. Beaten by her parents and sister, she has abandoned school and instead spends the day watching cartoons and trying to escape from the real world.When Mathilda's family is brutally murdered by a drug crazed Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), her only chance for survival is to hide with her neighbour. When she learns of Leon's true identity, she becomes infatuated with both him, and the grim world he inhabits.This stark portrayal of humanity and inhumanity is produced with the style and finesse that one expects from Luc Besson. In addition, the combined talents of Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman provide not only an unmatched on-screen chemistry, but also three perfectly created characterisations, the like of which are rarely seen in today's cinema. This film has my personal recommendation of being the best piece of cinema that I know of. I have not seen anything that matches it in terms of intensity or emotion - and believe me, I've looked. I found myself caring for the characters involved, an unique experience in itself.  This is not the type of film for a night in with your mates, but nevertheless, it is an unforgettable piece of cinematic history.",Léon - The Professional
577,chl-6,Blown away,10,8 February 2000,"I went and saw this movie at the cinema several years ago knowing -nothing- about it and was (almost literally) blown away by it.While it started out to be a fairly standard thriller, it quickly turned into a very original, very intense and ultimately deeply moving character piece intertwined with some grip-the-edge-of-your-seat action sequences, heightened no doubt by the fact that you -cared- about these characters and what happened to them.Jean Reno in many ways reprises his walk-on part as Victor the ""cleaner"" from Beson's ""La Femme Nikita"" (Leon/The Professional could almost be a sequel) and does so wonderfully, but the most enchanting surprise was then-newcomer Natalie Portman's Mathilda. I hadn't (and still haven't) been this impressed by a child's performance since, well, ever. I'm very glad to see that she has further delivered on her acting promise in movies such as Beautiful Girls and found a deserved measure of commercial success in Phantom Menace (Portman was one of the few redeeming features of that particular movie, but that's another review).The only slight flaw I perceived at the time was Gary Oldman's performance which, while effective, was - I thought - somewhat over-acted. Little did I know the measure of Oldman's restraint in this film until I saw his turn in The Fifth Element.",Léon - The Professional
578,TimG-2,Perfect synthesis of European and American cinema,10,15 April 2000,"This story about the friendship between a professional ""cleaner"" and a 12-year-old girl whose family has been killed by a gang of drug cops is one of the few movies that get better and better the more often I watch them. Luc Besson's masterpiece has everything a good movie needs: Thrill, excellent timing and cinematography, a touch of romance and, above all, outstanding actors. Jean Reno, between coolness and melancholy, acts brilliantly as the killer (a profession that he already performed in ""La femme Nikita""). And Natalie Portman, this hugely talented (and beautiful) young actress, maybe the best in her generation, is stunning in her (one can hardly believe it) first appearance on the screen. Everyone who is a fan of this movie (or wants to become one) should watch the ""Director's Cut"" as this longer version gives the relationship between Léon and Matilda more depth and emphasis. All in all, ""Léon"" is a perfect synthesis of European and American cinema  a modern thriller classic.  10/10",Léon - The Professional
579,jimmy81,**** from *****,8,29 June 2000,"Tall Frenchman Jean Reno excels with minimalist mimicry, impressive physicality and a tenderness in the title role of Luc Besson's powerfully, excitingly and suspensefully directed crime thriller drama about a lonesome hitman in New York, who accidentally gets homeless girl Natalie Portman, whose family was wiped out by corrupt detective Gary Oldman, and befriends himself with her, set for a tragedy. Despite the film's unbelievable central premise, Besson works at the top of his filmmaking skills here, especially in the gloriously, excellently choreographed action scenes, which mark the high points of the film along with the terrific cast. Portman is outstanding in her debut, although her role is badly written, she comes off very well, while Oldman plays the wickedly funny nutcase bad guy with gusto, and with Danny Aiello perfectly cast as Léon's only friend, boss and teacher. The music by Eric Serra and Sting is superb.",Léon - The Professional

I was also charmed by the friendship that grew between the hitman and the little girl. It shows that even the coldest persons do have a weak spot. These two characters -Leon and Mathilda- really are each others opposites. The opposites between characters makes the entire story. Stan (the DEA-agent) is as cruel as the hitman, but he's bad to the bone. Leon isn't, he's got a hart. Luc Besson -whose films I appreciate very much- really made one of his best films with ""Leon"". Gary Oldman plays one of his mean characters again, and again he does it brilliantly. The look on his face makes me shiver!! This film was the subject of a paper I made last year for one of the classes I took at university. The professor asked me to name a few ""symbols"" that are used in the film and to comment on them. I named the plant and the sunglasses as the most important symbols. Think about it!!!",Léon - The Professional

583,fable104,Good film but not great...,8,1 November 2007,"The Professional was a good movie and deserves to be on the IMDb 250, though it should be much lower in the ranking. Jean Reno makes most modern day action heroes look like wusses as he takes bullets out of his arm in the shower and sows his wounds up. And there is something endearing about the simple life he leads with his plant and milk. Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello played great character roles with Oldman as a pill-popping corrupt cop with random bursts of violence. But Natalie Portman annoyed the hell out of me in this film. I don't think someone was doing their job well if I ended up wanting her to get killed more than Gary Oldman. I know she was supposed to be annoying but I found the scene with her laughing at Leon as she gobbled down the wine he had bought for her as ugly. Also found the villains besides Gary Oldman as a bit too dimensional. They all look and act alike, no real personalities.",Léon - The Professional
584,srwatcher,"It's amazing, but now that it's out of my system it's easier to be honest.",10,29 October 2007,"This is my favorite film of all time(I have seen many) and for that it deserves a 10/10. I love it so much. There are however flaws to this film as there is with anything and I will say what I feel those are. Most of them involve the Stansfield character.The Very Positives: 1. Matilda's Character is played so well that you think she's a real person. I find this awesome and it allows me to watch the movie multiple times because I really can't find any fault with her acting. Any other young actress I feel probably could have easily destroyed this role and/or movie.2. The Music. I usually HATE music in films. I find most of it to be blatantly recycled ideas or boring. I LOVE the music in Leon. Leon is a GREAT fresh air. Not only does the composer do things that aren't too typical, he has thematic themes for characters and easily rivals John Williams and Danny Elfman(though I can't say that about the rest of Eric Serra's film scores). The themes even bring Nobuo Uematsu to mind at times.3. Jean Reno's Leon character. On-screen this character looks so natural. And upon further viewings he still does. I have been watching this film critically lately as it's been out of my system from my initial ""wow"" and studying this character's face leaves me to find no flaws.4. The artistic camera angles. The director was VERY smart in his choices of shots at least in the first half of the film. This makes it very hard for me to even try to find a boring moment. And by the time the pace slows down you care for the characters so much you're ready for it.The Very Negatives: 1. Matilda's father doesn't take Stansfield serious enough in the beginning even though he should have been able to tell how crazy he actually was. I mean either, get the man what he wants or have your family out before 12 the next day, yeah. But It's believable. I could believe that Matilda's father could've thought that Stansfield wouldn't do anything especially in regard to his position in the law. But that being said, Matilda's father wasn't shown to be too bright either.2. The scene of charades starting with ""Like A Virgin"" from Madonna. I dunno how many times I have cringed watching her first charade. I don't feel it was necessary at all. The rest were cute and/or funny but the first one was kind of screaming exploitive.3. When Matilda goes to the DEA office of Norman Stansfield. He threatens to kill her in... the bathroom. Okay, maybe there's no security cameras there but that would be over the top and definitely lose him his badge. He could however arrest her for the possession of all those guns. He made the right choice in the end.The Great Ending: A man with nothing to lose gains something he can't lose. A girl that has lost everything finds something. This is one of the few movies that I feel actually portrays true love which is a word that is often misrepresented in our culture. Love doesn't mean kissing and/or a sex scene. It doesn't even have to and this movie shows that fact perfectly.",Léon - The Professional
585,mh_yan,Captivating movie !,10,7 July 2002,"I have actually seen the cut version of Leon couple of yrs back and though it did impressed me then, it was not until I have seen it again on video that it captivated me !

And every time I have re-watch it, it will seem like I am watching it for the first time and the anticipation is still there, that's how good the movie is for me.I am excited as after so many yrs, this movie is still talked about.The story plot is interesting to watch as it unfolds showing how Leon does his work professionally without having to worry about other things and later how his life is changed by Mathilda.The directing is superb by Luc Besson and the music by Eric Serra sets the mood for each scene, intensifying the story.Jean Reno's role as Leon is also superb as it brings out the character of Leon.

586,sslatten3,Over-Rated,5,20 May 2006,"This is one of those movies that you're ""supposed"" to like if you're a film buff. Truth is, it just hasn't aged well. Great cast/acting aside, the story comes off as just another mid-90's, ultra-violent Pulp Fiction clone. I've seen other films from that era recently, such as True Romance and Natural Born Killers. They all seem to mistake shock value for realism. Pulp Fiction pulls off the ultra-violence routine because it is about something other than the violence itself. Most other films of that genre, The Professional included, are almost comical in their melodrama. My guess is that this type of film will look passé for the next 50 years and then make a comeback, like film noir has. Until then, 5/10.",Léon - The Professional

Gary Oldman was in good form as always (to really see him in a crazy role see True Romance).  I give it a 10/10.",Léon - The Professional
588,Twinsen61,Visceral and intelligent - Besson's masterpiece,9,19 January 2004,"Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - ""It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality"" as Gary Oldman very well put it.
In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments"". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion  in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable ""EVERYONE!"" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled -  just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: ""everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid"" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in ""real life""? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",Léon - The Professional

This movie is one of my favorites, and the acting is one such a high level that it´s almost scary. Gary Oldman, and Jean Reno delivers their best performances to this day. And the hugely talented Natalie Portman acts with the vulnerability and sensitivity of an actress filled with routine, although she was but 13 years old at the time she acted in this masterpiece. This movie is well written, it has a beautifully painful cinematography, it´s amazingly good directed, it´s extremely well acted, and the music is so beautiful.

It takes Portman's transition form an innocent child, unaware of her parents' drug dealing, to a determined young woman to bring both Reno and Oldman a sense of humanity that is eventually their undoing.This is a great movie with excellent acting, exciting, realistic action, and a neat plot.

For me the movie was a fantastic trip. There were scenes where you are treated to a girl trying to seduce or force an adult man to love her. She tells him that she loves him. In one scene she insisted he kiss her. In another scene she forced him to have sex with her and in act of love she forced him to share a bed with her (not sex sadly).
The movie was very inspirational for me and there were many lofty scenes in the movie.
Personally I loved like the movie.",Léon - The Professional
607,rly-smart-persen,Fantastic but creepy.,7,1 September 2020,"It was an absolutely brilliant film, BUTTTTTTTT it just gets incredibly creepy and uncomfortable at times regarding the little girl, and that completely lets it down for me. It's such a shame.",Léon - The Professional
608,gadagast,Solid but slightly creepy.,7,3 March 2021,"Ok, so this is a pretty compelling action-y thriller in the same vein as Drive (2011) for something contemporary and comparable. Good performances by all the leads and especially Gary Oldman for selling how bonkers Stanfield is. My main complaint is how Natalie Portman is shot and written to be a sort of temptress and while I understand it's supposed to make you uncomfortable, it pushes it enough to really make you raise your eyebrows and wonder what were they thinking.",Léon - The Professional
609,kerematalar,Great Relationship,10,17 August 2021,Honestly the storyline was very good and the ending was top class.My only problem is that some scenes looked a bit unrealistic like rescuing mathilda from the federal building. Character development was very very good and the ending almost made me cryI hope there will be a remake of this movie so i can watch this masterpiece again.,Léon - The Professional
610,d3ei,Great film,8,7 April 2002,"i have watched the directors cut of this movie and it is one of the best movies i have ever watched in my entire life.  Natalie Portman is beautiful and wonderful acting by Jean Reno and Gary Oldman.I dont know why they had to cut 26 minutes of this film.  If you only saw the edited version, there is a whole other aspect to this movie which makes it a love story.",Léon - The Professional
611,politikin,One Bad Motha...,9,14 August 2002,"I love this movie.  I think it is the best performance Natalie Portman has offered us, followed by Beautiful Girls.  I Love this movie.  Jean Reno does an excellent job.  He's impnetrable and unstoppable one moment, and at teh mercy of a twelve-year old girl the next.  Fantastic. No women.  No kids.  And there you have it.  Simple ideas in an amazing film...",Léon - The Professional
612,rustysettler,"Excellent, smart action film.",10,4 January 2005,"Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit ""La Femme Nikiti"", and in many ways it's an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other.",Léon - The Professional
613,quick_relief,One of my favourite films of all time!,10,24 August 2003,"Although this film was made some time ago, I only recently purchased the movie after a recommendation from a friend whom I know is usually right about the quality of films. The first time I saw it, I liked it, after a few times i fell in love with it. I seem to get more drawn in each time! It combines an enchanting love story with the sort of action that has become a character trait for director Luc Besson. None of the three main actors (Reno,Portman,Oldman) have bettered their performances since doing this film. A special note needs to be made about the music; Eric Serra who also did the music for Le Grande Bleau and La Femme Nikita Simple has arguably created the most beautifully enchanting film score in cinematic history. A simple story, beautifully executed.",Léon - The Professional
614,i-r-matt,brilliant. absolutely brilliant.,10,10 May 2012,"I don't think I've rated a film 10/10 on here yet, but this is most definitely a deserving recipient.Unlike the films that are recommended or assumed to be alike to it, Leon has so much more of a heart than most other hit-man/assassination based films. I'm not normally a fan of movies within this genre, so i cast my 10/10 with an unbiased eye. I loved this film, I really did. Leon and Mathilda are both such memorable, endearing characters, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman and Jean Reno. Gary Oldman also plays his part with such ease, fantastically.The killing scenes throughout the film are spectacular, and the cinematography is surprisingly stunning. I'm surprised this never won any Oscars or Golden Globes. This is a film that most certainly deserves its 'Cult Classic' label, and is a movie that should be a trailblazer for the genre.",Léon - The Professional
615,efs2,Amazing Film,9,8 April 2010,"There is little I can add to the many things that have been said about Leon. But I will offer two observations. One is that Leon is not lascivious. Many if not most or all would-be viewers presume that it will be, and then are disappointed, or, like me, amazed that it is not. It is easy to understand the expectation. How could the story of a disturbingly attractive 12-year-old girl ""adopted"" by a single middle-aged man under bizarre circumstances - he literally holds the power of life and death over her - not be lascivious? All I can say is that the director and actors somehow found a way to avoid it. The other point, which is related to the first, is that Natalie Portman's performance is mesmerizing. She more than holds her own in her scenes with Jean Reno, and with Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello, whom I consider among the very best. That is extraordinary.",Léon - The Professional
616,georgess97,the finest work by director Luc Besson,10,25 April 2014,"Reno's performance of hangdog loyalty lends his character pleasing sympathy while Besson's heavily stylized direction builds tension around sexy violence. Luc Besson is a masterly director of stylish, thrilling, and humorous action set pieces. You'll enjoy the action, but you'll remember the movie because of Reno and Portman. Leon (The Professional) is quite possibly the finest work by director Luc Besson.There's conviction in this movie, and intelligence. Besson's incomparable film is almost impossible to beat and there's yet to be a director who could match his magnum opus. Even after twenty years, ""Leon: The Professional"" stands as the superlative masterpiece of action filmmaking and has yet to be matched or toppled by any director in the business.",Léon - The Professional
617,Ethical_Anarhist,Classic action and personal saga,10,11 March 2005,"If you still have not seen this movie you do not know how far the movie in the action genre can go. It pushes the mind of the viewer further and further with each scene, and by the end of the film you feel exhausted as if you were actually the one who has gone through the whole saga together with Léon and Mathilda.However, at no time is this movie hard to understand or is unclear. The plot is laid out in the original and unpredictable, but yet very logical manner; and everyone who has ever had to search for one's one identity under the difficult circumstances will definitely be able to relate to the main characters.The only negative side of the movie is that it has been cut in pieces for the US audiences, and even more when it was shown on television (some times changing the plot).",Léon - The Professional
618,sanghouse,Simply Superb,10,24 May 2005,"This is quite simply superb. The acting is great, the action is fantastic and the touches of humour are excellent. Jean Reno is one of my favourite actors, he is good in anything (he was the only good thing about Godzilla) but here he excels himself as a loner hit-man. Gary Oldman is on top form also as the deranged cop ""Stansfield""One day his neighbours, who are involved with drugs are murdered, leaving their 12 year old daughter, Mathilda (a young Natalie Portman or ""Princess Leia"") to fend for herself. Jean Reno reluctantly takes care of her and shows her the tricks of his trade so she can kill the guy (Gary Oldman) who killed her family. The story progresses as Mathilda and Leon bond and as she plucks up enough courage to go after the men who killed her family. The end sequence is incredible as Jean Reno takes on about half of America's police to save Mathilda.10/10 Perfect",Léon - The Professional

620,yakupkonars,One of the best stories ever told by a criminal's perspective,10,18 December 2005,"Leon is a movie that takes us to the life of an assassin who is really professional and merciless, and expects us to look life from his eyes. It is a story about a 12 years old girl taking the revenge of her little brother who killed by cops. Mathilda, acted by a child Natalie Portman, has nowhere to go, but the assassin who saved her life by opening the door of his house to her. I really admire Besson's work and effort to create an atmosphere that led us to take side of the criminal (Leon), who is also responsible for the deaths of tens of people. Oh, yes he is a very very bad person in many ways but the director shows us how to empathy with a film character who can simply defined as BAD.Not only the directing, but also the performances have a great share of the film's success (especially Gary Oldman's). I think Natalie Portman took her first role in a film, and in the film, we have witnessed the birth of a talented actress.",Léon - The Professional
621,jozefxs,Intense!,9,22 February 2020,"Really excellent movie. Fantastic actors, and great performances by Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman. The chemistry between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman was a highlight of the movie. Dialogue was minimalistic, but meaningful. The standout scene for me was when Mathilda (the character played by Natalie Portman) sought refuge from Leon (Jean Reno). At the first viewing many years ago, the scene seemed to last forever - there was that much tension to the scene. But on re-watching the movie, I noticed that the scene was actually just one minute only.",Léon - The Professional
622,zogz54,noxious and twee,2,13 December 2007,"Much of the flak that this film has received has been directed at its alleged paedophilic inclinations; I think this criticism has some truth to it, but is often overplayed. What really bothers me about 'Leon' is another form of child abuse: the 'grooming' of a minor as a would-be professional assassin. Hollywood revenge flicks are a dime-a-dozen of course, and they usually end up endorsing vigilante violence in one way or another. But what makes this film so awful is the application of this trope to the realm of childhood, and, further, its blank refusal to consider the moral implications of this stance. Sure, the little girl's family has been wiped out, and she wants payback, but is the most humane response to the situation really to help satisfy her desires, and get her even more entangled in the world of brutal criminality? The criminals are simply regulation scum who deserve what they get, and a little girl is deemed as suitable an agent of vengeance as an experienced hit-man. Leon is just as much a criminal and a murderer as the bad guys, but he is strong, taciturn and endowed with a sentimental streak, so he's 'noble'. No deeper reflection is required. Dress it all up in the odious trappings of fey Gallic whimsy (ye Gods, it's worse than 'Amelie'!), and the movie's nasty little heart beats on unnoticed. Seldom has a soundtrack got on my nerves quite as much as this one did. Yuck, yuck, yuck.",Léon - The Professional

625,Dusty-28,One of the few movies that successfully combine all the tools available,10,16 May 1999,"Leon is one of the few movies that combine practically every basic cinematic tool, creating not only suspense and action but also atmosphere, sympathy, hate, different perspectives and a glimpse at perversity. Of course the subject 'hitman' could be used in every other 'action' movie, but Leon is more. Leon looks a bit lost, innocent almost, unable in some way to live a normal life, and not trying to because it would only interfere with his work. Matilda practically forces him to feel love and responsibility, which makes him sacrifice himself. The styling is magnificent: the movie combines baroque (Oldman) with touching minimalism (Reno). Serra's music is also remarkable, one of the first times that this aspect came to my notice as such (except of course sometimes when certain songs appeared). All this makes Leon one of my all time favorites.",Léon - The Professional
626,IcAbOd,AMAZING,10,2 July 1999,This film was amazing... literally the first film to make me cry.  Natalie Portman's performance was absolutely stunning.  Jean Ruso's character and performance were the best I have seen in a VERY long time.  Gary Oldman is possibly the most terrifying character I have ever seen.  It scared me just looking at him...The storyline is amazing... With more thrills and actions sequences than Speed and True Lies combined.  It's an amazing film with an absolutely amazing cast.

627,denkixd51,I owed this to myself,10,23 June 2019,"I owed this to myself because this is that first movie that fell on me, that movie that we each had inside because it was the first one that shook us, that tore us apart, that looked inside us and found everything, stirring, and you throbbing, shrinking in your chair, stirring and trying to contain the emotion, it left you totally downcast, upset and overshadowed with one of those little stories that only the cinema knows how to enlarge, to which only the cinema knows how to shape, give depth, get you to reach the end and feel in your very flesh any event that the characters lived.Here, the fact of telling such an atypical story, where a young girl and a hitman, where innocence and rigor collide, are already a turning point to get hooked on the screen, and enjoy those moments with Mathilda , that girl full of character and determination, who meets the seriousness and neatness of Leon, an old lonely wolf, who only lives for himself ... and for his plant.
And after that hitch, come those precious moments where the camera goes beyond, the camera uncovers their lives, their most intimate moments, all those moments that nobody would want to see again for fear of looking ridiculous, all those moments that nobody would want to return and see to wonder if he was acting properly or not, all those moments that, in short, make each and every one of us unique individuals, with our moments of fragility, desolation, joy, frustration and sadness, and that show our weaker and brittle side, our side that, in short, makes us what we are: Beings full of the most disparate and impulsive feelings.""Leon"", in addition, was the catapult for that little girl named Natalie Portman, who sweetens her character like nobody and gives her enough character to perform one of the best interpretations of someone of that age, if not the best, and with plenty of advantage over the others.
On the other side, Reno embroiders those papers that he knows so well to deal with, with that thoroughness and rigor that he only knows how to use when he has such a severe character before him, with such marked features, factions that give him away and after which he also hides a kind smile, a nice side, an endearing look.
Gary Oldman, as always and here more than ever, overreacts by carrying out one of those personalities that he does so well, precisely because of being brazen and daring, and for offering him precisely the skills required by that character. He is followed by an Aiello whose presence on the screen is always pleasant, and a cast that exceeds.If we talk about ""Leon"", we could also talk about its flaws that, like any film, has them, but the truth is that I do not feel like doing it, as they are more than evident, and I prefer to stay with those beautiful walks from Leon, Mathilda and the plant in NY, or with those imitations in the hotel room that take us to the most magical side of the protagonists, or with that sad, desolate ending, that sticks in you like a dagger, and leaves you totally engrossed with the theme of Sting ringing in your ears, which gives the last frames a unique strength.
And I am also aware that ""Leon"" is not a film of 10, and although I always try to be objective, I think in this case it is inevitable, I cannot say anything other than, EXCELLENT. For me, the greatest movie of all time.""Léon, I think I'm kinda falling in love with you...""",Léon - The Professional

I was emotionally touched by the actors performances. Gary Oldman, Jean Reno, even Natalie Portman. All of them made me cry. Jean Reno as Leon is the perfect role for him.

Such a natural presence and delivery is a rare thing. It's as if she had been living this part for her whole 11 yrs. And Reno gave us his best role ever. The King of Badguys has played many great characters, but Oldman is on fire here. The guy could be the best villain to ever hit the screen. I think back to some of his bad guys he's played, and those movies wouldn't be the same if he wasn't a part of them. The soundtrack is also tremendous, and the closing song by Sting really defined the whole film. I have nothing bad to say about this film, and would have done nothing different.

The most special ingredient of this movie is the mixture of emotions the story creates: For a few minutes, one could think it might be an action adventure, but then, there is the mysterious touch which elevates the viewer into another world without being totally surrealistic.Little time elapses when suddenly the mood changes again from homely, to funny, and in a blink of an eye, it becomes really dramatic.

The movie has humor and a great soundtrack. This movies has no cgi which in my view is a good thing. The Hit-man who rescues a young girl at great risk which he understands better than anyone due to his profession, He goes against what he is and what he is all about because he cares deep down under the ruthless hit-man exterior is a caring human being and as the movies goes on we see more and more of this from him.

It is above all about true friendship--Leon and Mathilda create a special bond that is above gender, age, experience, and (even despite some of the overtones, I would argue) sexuality.Not only does the movie handle the theme of friendship very well, but its backbone is a killer action movie with lots of wicked gunplay scenes.

645,justinraphaelm,Good movie that is a little overrated...,6,16 June 2017,"'Leon: the Professional' is a movie that follows a young girl (Nat Portman) who's family (father and brother) is killed in the wake of a drug deal gone wrong, and subsequently, taken in by a neighbouring assassin who teaches her his trade. While the movie is not bad, it still suffers from a predictable plot line - and actions sequences- that, although are entertaining, never rise past the clutches of mid 90's action movie mediocrity. Yes, at times the movie is entertaining, but never more than movies like 'True Lies"", which was filmed around the same time. While there is a saving grace which prevents this movie from being another typical Hollywood mainstream action movie - which is the 3-4 minutes we get to see of Jean Reno connecting with Natalie Portman's character as a 12 year old child - there is not much else except what is to be expected. Nothing blew my mind for instance in the way that 'Reservoir Dogs' did as a violent low budget, yet interesting, character developed movie, or, say 'Pulp fiction' for it's dialogue. Nor did it have the sentimental connection that earned movies like the 'Shawshank redemption' or 'Schindler' list, great professional and public praise. The movie is well done, the actions sequences are also well done for the time, and the overall movie experience is not bad. I may be a little late in reviewing this movie, it having been almost 23 years since the movie graced cinemas,but honestly, considering the reviews that the movie has given, 8.6/10 (IMDB), I find it pretty disappointing (again, not that it was a bad movie, but because it was made to seem better than it is). I wish they had spent little more time connecting the characters of Natalie Portman and Jean Reno a little more, I think it could have been much more sentimental, emotive, and connecting as an overall experience. 6/10",Léon - The Professional
646,jonahwp,A Masterpiece of an Action/Drama Film Perfectly Executed,8,29 December 2015,"With the brilliant acting of Jean Reno and a young Natalie Portman, and with the brilliant direction of Luc Besson, Léon: The Professional is sure to please any action fanatic or drama lover. From the opening scene of this movie, you can tell that every take was thought out and every take has a unique mood. Léon: the Professional isn't without its flaws, however, which I will outline later in the review. One aspect that Besson really put his back into was the characters, and it shows. A young Natalie Portman plays Mathilda, a down on her luck kid who craves revenge and a parental figure to guide her through a tough part of her life. Léon, played by Jean Reno, truly is the star of this film. Léon is a notorious Italian assassin who travels on a path of self discovery throughout this whole film. With every word that Léon speaks you can sense a deep and daring combination of optimism, pessimism, and darkness. Though he is a rather quiet character, just the tone in Léon's voice shows that he is a true striking mafia man. Finally, the villain in this film, played by Gary Oldman, is a devious character. As the film progresses, your hate for him builds up inside. My one issue with Oldman's character, however, is that you cannot relate to him. All good villains should have a reason for what they are doing and something in common with the protagonist, in this case Léon. This was not present in Oldman's character. Aside from this one minor flaw, great, realistic but still awesome characters made this film what it is. As great as the characters are, when I think of this movie I will always first think of its incredible score, composed by John Altman. Every step of the way the score perfectly accompanies the mood of the scene. It is a perfect example of how symphony music doesn't just appeal to the wide arrange of 80 year old's throughout the world, but can also appeal to many more people if executed correctly, which it was. As my title would suggest, Léon can't be fit into one genre, but many. The action aspect of this film is incredible. With near complete use of practical effects and Besson's history in directing great action films, you really marvel at how certain scene's were created (particularly the end of act three, like holy crap!). The drama and emotional conflict in this film is also substantial. You can understand and relate to many of the characters in this movie, and really feel what they are feeling for a lot of the film (aside from the large number of people in this film that get shot, that would hurt like hell and as a result Besson didn't include that aspect for viewers). There is also a strange feeling of romance in this film, but that gets into spoiler territory so I should shut up! One slight issue that I have always had in this film is not what is present, but what is not, for the majority of the film. Unlike most other films, my favorite moment in Léon: the Professional is the first act. There is a deep feeling of darkness and actual fear throughout the whole first act. You get the horrendous feeling that something awful will happen, and it does. I would've liked to see that feeling of darkness a bit more throughout the film. Not the whole time, but I think that feeling could have added a lot to a few scenes. In conclusion, Léon the Professional is a gorgeous, musical, grim, witty, and brilliantly put together film. For this reason it deserves an A- (8.3/10).",Léon - The Professional
647,accelerius,One of the most under appreciated films of all time,9,19 July 2014,"Luc Besson (Transporter, Taken, The Fifth Element) directs the intense visceral and compelling action/drama of Leon, released in the USA as The Professional. It could be called as a karate kid film...except with guns and assassins. I was left wondering to myself at the end why wasn't this film given even one nomination in direction or acting. Now it is considered as one of the best films ever made and is currently at the time of writing this review sitting at #25 in IMDb's top 250 list. At the very least it is one of the finest cinematic experience of the 1990's. Leon is a ""cleaner"" or a hit-man living in Little Italy. He has learned to suppress emotions and feelings and lives his life in a little apartment working for Tony, a mob boss. His life is turned around when 12 year old Mathilda who lives on the same floor and has been recently orphaned comes to him for help. Leon grudgingly helps her at first but soon discovers his own inner child. All the scenes are shot beautifully and the action sequences are well planned. The score works well with the film. The acting is superb especially from Natalie Portman who played young Mathilda in her debut film at just the age of 13. She displays her emotions well with her body behavior and immaculate expressions. She was born with the talent. Jean Reno (Pink Panther, The Da Vinci Code) does a good role as Leon, the mentally slow and emotionally dumb hit-man for whom you start to feel. Making someone feel for a hit-man is certainly not easy. Danny Aiello as Tony also gives a good performance and delivers as required.Gary Oldman does such an intense, quirky, interesting and terrifying role as the corrupt DEA officer Norman Stansfield that he deserved at least an Oscar nomination. He gives an absolutely electrifying performance and the fact that he improvised one of the best scenes in the film proves his acting chops. The film is not for the fainthearted and the action never feels to be artificial or deliberate. The story, while basic, incorporates all the elements for an interesting 2 hours. It's a cinematic success about innocence destroyed and innocence reborn. The cast show that there is no substitute for good acting and you don't need special effects to make a good action film. While the accolades are missing, Leon-the professional is definitely a cult classic.",Léon - The Professional
648,haruzawa,moved movie,10,1 January 2016,"This movie portrays pure love between Leon and Mathilda. Leon is a professional hit-man. He lives alone. His friends is plant only. Mathilda lives her family. However, her families don't have interest in her. One day, Mathilda's father was killed by gangs. Mathilda got away from them, then she reached to Leon. At first, Leon thought he shelters her for a limited time only, but gradually he prefer to live with Mathilda. In this movie, Leon says ""I love you"" to Mathilda for the first time in the last scene, but we can know Leon loves Mathilda from his face and look of things in the middle of this movie. In this movie, their sad and painful love is so beautiful.",Léon - The Professional

Disappointing that my favorite scene is missing, when Mathilda tells Leon how old she is.

653,VidRoth,Highly original. Very brilliant.,10,10 February 1999,"Leon is one of the best, most original films you'll ever get the chance to see.  It is gritty, yet fast.  It is action-packed, yet startlingly artistic.  If you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to go rent it immediately.The cast is superb.  This was Natalie Portman's first movie, but you'll never guess it from her performance; she is stellar.  There's no description that will do her acting debut justice; you just have to see it.  Jean Reno oozes controlled danger (as he's done in so many films), but also a brilliant naivete that makes every scene enjoyable.  And Gary Oldman is one of the most disturbing bad guys you'll ever see; you start off wondering what's so scary about him, and then you see him in action and you're glad you're on the safe side of the screen.If you're wondering about the ""Leon"" vs. ""The Professional"" thing, here's the scoop as nearly as I understand it:  test screenings of the original film ""Leon"" were shown in the U.S., and our typically puritanical reviewers decided it contained ""inappropriate content"" that would put off American viewers.  So, Luc Besson and Co. had to cut out about 20 minutes of footage to satisfy our hypocritcal ""powers-that-be.""  The edited film was retitled ""The Professional"" and released stateside, while the uncut film was left ""Leon"" and released in the rest of the world.As a result, all you will easily find for rental/sale in the U.S. is The Professional.  Now, that's the version I saw first, and believe me, the editing job was pure artistry.  You will never miss the 20 minutes of footage if you haven't seen the full version; it's that well cut.  Go see it now, if that's all that's available to you (and it probably is).  BUT, if you can find a way to see ""Leon"" instead (or even afterwards), definitely do it.  For those of you who might be worried what you'd be exposed to:  there is NO nudity in either version of the film.  There is no sexual conduct or even IMPLIED sexual conduct between Leon and Mathilda.  Two kinds of things were cut out of the movie:  1.  the idea that a 12-year old girl might THINK about sex, and 2.  the idea that a 12-year old girl could learn about being a hitman.  That's it.  If the character had been 15 they would never have made them cut the movie, but hey, that's American reviewers.See it right now.  That is all.",Léon - The Professional
654,Methi,Bang! You're dead.,9,21 September 1998,"I saw this movie first time in 1995. It's one of those movies I wouldn't mind wathcing again. Gary Oldman is truly amazing. A completely and utterly psychopathic person. That look in his eye. Oh, I like these calm little moments before the storm. Intense action all along. A complete atmosphere (music/plot) Maybe a bit pathetic with the would-be daughter, but towards the end I enjoyed the special friedship between the cleaner and the little cleaner. A masterpiece.",Léon - The Professional
655,SICKY,!!!Watch it!!!Watch it!!!Watch it!!!,10,1 July 1999,"I've seen this movie and I have to say there are only a few Action movies living up to it. Reno and Portman are doing great, and Gary Oldman's bad guy role is so cleanly played you'll learn to hate him. The only thing that got me disappointed was Danny Aiello's poor figure. Aiello is a fine actor, though. Watching this movie is a must for every single action lover, go rent it!!!",Léon - The Professional
656,Dikkker,"Be sure to see the ""Integral version - Director´s Cut""!",10,13 December 1999,"So what to say about this movie, that I personally consider to be the best movie ever made...  ;)First, it is nice to see everytime, how great it comes out, when writer, director and cameraman are ONE person (even if Besson did not the camera in ""Leon"") - It shows up in so many sequences, that the writer had already in mind how a scene should be filmed as he directs the actors..Jean Reno is really brilliant, acting between a professional killer and an innocent child.But the absolute highlight of ""Leon"" is the first appearance of Natalie Portman. Playing 12 year old Mathilda, she gives such a wonderful performance, that I´ve seen the film now for over a dozen times - and I start to giggle immediately when Mathilda gets her ""laugh-attack"" in the restaurant.Of course a brilliant beast: Gary Oldman!Important note: Be sure to see the Director´s Cut (aka ""Integral version"") It contains more than 25 minutes that were cut out the first release. It is not just a few scenes, that might contain brutality or sex - it is just a complete part of the story.Actually, Mathilda thinks to love Leon, and wants to get closer to him, as he would let her. She is even asking him to sleep with her, which he refuses. But it seemes to be to hard for the original release of the film - (thought the marketing guys).So, anything in there: love, comedy, action, beautiful pictures and wonderful actorsStrongly recommended!",Léon - The Professional
657,d.verhagen,"Phew, what a movie!",10,1 September 2000,"This movie really blew me away. I expected to see a movie with an assassin who killed a lot of people and a girl who helps him with it. Never did I expect to see such a heavy-mooded emotional display of the relation growing between the old Leon, performed in all his simplicity and greatness by Jean Reno, and the 12-year-old Mathilde, performed by the superb Natalie Portman who really proves that children can act, she even outweighs Jean Reno and Gary Oldman. The plot is pretty well known I think so I won't elaborate too much but it's a plot that might not surprise you, but is sure is not the 200 million blockbuster happy ending plot you might expect. It's well laid down in the movie. (Spoiler) The dying scene of Leon is the fist actual scene in a movie where I almost couldn't hold back my tears. The relationship between Leon and Mathilde was done so well, you could almost feel his pain and her sorrow, and you felt miserably, also the way it was shot was absolutely brilliant. This scene is an instant classic. (spoiler end)all and all definitely one of the best movies ever and indeed a true addition to the top 250",Léon - The Professional
658,July_Faraday,A violent yet very gentle movie,9,2 April 2014,"I've been postponing watching this movie for a long time, I guess I tend to judge movies by the cover... but I was very wrong, it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The chemistry is so obvious between Matilda and Leon since the first scene they share together. The character development is so amazing, shows that human emotions are strongest and can soften even the toughest man. I believe this movie has one of the gentlest and purest love story in history of movies and portrayed to perfection.I haven't seen a movie that awakens such nice emotions and sympathy than this one; If you haven't seen it, please do so, you will be amazed;",Léon - The Professional

This is one of my favorite movies right now. It has good action, a bit of dark humor and above all a good story. This film was really an emotional rollercoaster for me. Gary Oldman was born to play the role of Stansfield. Jean Reno was perfect for Leon. And Natalie Portman acted like a natural. The ending was so well done. Natalie Portman's Mathilda who planted Leon's plant in the ground of her new home, with Sting's beautiful ""Shape Of My Heart"" in the background made me shed a tear.

With the sinister whisperings of dialog and script complimented by a marvelously mind-blowing movie score, the heart of the film beats vibrantly throughout one's senses. The casting calls for celebration, and the acting demands a standing ovation. Witness Gary Oldman's portrayal of a corrupted psychotic cop who's progressively descending down the psycho-pathological trail. Then there's Jean Reno's masterful delivery of Leon, a reclusive and elusive, antisocial slayer for the mob who begins his ascent from his lonely oubliette of despair.

675,Rudy Poot,The Uncut Version,10,12 August 2002,"I've seen the US cut of this movie about 40 times in the last 2 months and I just saw the much hyped uncut international version today and though it was nice to see more of an already great movie, I didn't think the uncut version changed the way I felt about the relationship between the characters all that much, if at all. I guess I can understand why the movie was edited the way it was for the US based on the ridiculous comments I've read stating the uncut version portrays them as lovers. I don't know, maybe there's another cut out there that includes a scene where Leon doesn't push her away and instead, makes hot, passionate, ""Woody Allen style"" love to her but I doubt it. Truthfully, only 2 scenes not in the US version were really worth seeing, the very first one, about an hour and 10 minutes in and the last ""extra"" scene, which takes place right after Leon saves her from the D.E.A. building. The US version is not as bad as people make it out to be, it's far from ""just an action movie"" the first time I saw it, I was drawn in by the characters and I actually cared what happened to them, which rarely happens to me. I wouldn't say I prefer the US version but I would tell someone who has only seen the US cut that their world isn't exactly incomplete if they haven't seen the Uncut version.",Léon - The Professional
676,jordell5,A film that is near perfection,10,26 March 2012,"Whenever I asked people a list of their favourite films, Leon often found its way in their repitoire of fantastic films. Considering it was released in 1994, and I only saw it for the first time in Autumn 2011, my first thoughts after watching Leon were: 'how have I not seen this masterpiece until now?'. It was truly one of the most mind-blowing Television experiences of my life.The plot itself is nothing spectacularly original- a deadly assassin (Leon played by Jean Reno) who keeps his business to himself in order to survive, fosters a young girl (Natalie Portman) whose family is executed because the father was hoarding drugs from a crazy drug-dealer (Gary Oldman) who is also a corrupt policeman. The young girl fortunately went to the shop while her family were massacred, and when she returns, she pleads to Leon to save her life. She discovers that Leon is secretly an assassin, and because she has lost her family, she asks Leon to teach her how to become an assassin so she can claim revenge on those responsible for murdering her family. In exchange, she offers to teach Leon to read and write and improve his social skills. (he is pretty much illiterate). Although at first he refuses her request, eventually he relents and teaches her the tricks of his trade.The three main actors in the film play their parts incredibly; Jean Reno as Leon plays his part so convincingly as an uneducated and detached assassin that you could almost believe that he is one in real life, Natalie Portman plays the mischievous, witty and headstrong young girl who seems older than her age with excellence,arguably her best performance that is only rivaled by her great performance in 'The Black Swan', and Gary Oldman portrays the psychotic drug-dealing policeman with such finesse only a few actors could pull off without spoiling the main villain of the story.What makes this film truly powerful to the eyes of the viewer is the bond between Leon and the girl- at first they are completely incompatible, but as they spend more time with one another, they become more versed in each others manners and skills, and become so in love with one another that they become inseparable, in lifestyle, and in their missions.I originally watched the un-cut version of the film, and after buying the film to discover it cut out several scenes, I was pretty disappointed. I can understand why- there were several scenes that were perhaps unsuitable for a young girl to be seen doing, but these scenes added great character and depth; they were included in the film for a great reason. What this film does excellently which few directors can imitate is deliver violence and explicit scenes with a perfect balance of seriousness and comedy. It brought both tears of joy and sadness to my eyes with equal measure. From beginning to end Leon never ceases to amaze and astonish. I cannot think of anything that could be changed or done to make 'Leon' a better film- it is a film that is as near to perfection as any film gets.",Léon - The Professional
677,wildamike,A beautiful and disturbing piece of cinema,10,8 August 2010,"This is an extraordinary film, one of the rarities that successfully straddles the action and drama genres. A young girl from an abusive drug-dealing family approaches the smashed-in door of her apartment. Instinctively she realises that everyone has been murdered by the corrupt drug-squad officers standing at the door. Stifling her terror, she walks past to the door of another apartment and knocks on it as though it is her own home, praying that the strange neighbour will open the door and let her in Luc Besson explores with great skill the unlikely relationship between Mathilde the 12-year old orphan and Leon: professional killer, immature loner and psychopath. Despite their apparent differences, the similarities are greater: Leon is childlike in many ways, whereas Mathilde (perhaps through necessity) demonstrates a ruthlessness that will give hardened criminals pause.There is action a-plenty. At times it defies reality, although no more so than the action scenes in Lethal Weapon or Die Hard, and the character juxtaposition is way beyond what such films usually achieve.Some of the negative reviews on this site are hard to believe: some don't like it because it depicts corrupt DEA agents (reality check people – every police agency has bad apples); others don't like it because it is said to push pedophilia (yet Besson goes out of his way to show that, despite having every opportunity, Leon firmly rejects any sexual relationship with Mathilde); others are disturbed by the thought that a 12-year old girl could contemplate revenge or seriously want to kill the men who murdered her little brother (again, sorry for the dose of reality but in some parts of the world children younger than this are soldiers, drug-dealers or worse); some reviewers are clearly disturbed by the ""European"" feel to the film (personal taste – I liked it).The movie ends on a surprisingly optimistic note: Mathilde's wild proposal to work as an assassin is rejected by a horrified mafioso. Despite his amorality (and the obvious uses that someone in his position could find for her) he produces the money for her school fees and sends her packing. At school, she plants Leon's pet plant so that it can ""put down roots"" – a symbol that she herself is now going to do that, instead of the rootless life she has been living since the slaughter of her family.Despite the violence and gore, the themes of the film are love (in the non-sexual sense), companionship and human need.",Léon - The Professional

This masterpiece is really a proof that movies are truly a form of art. The action in this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the romance it displays will make you forget everything our backward society has tought you. The story is truly touching and, even though Leon represents everything our society hates (""the most vicious crime of all""), you just cannot hate the character. The movie really makes you question your views on what's moral, and what's immoral and think deep about hate against love - which feeling is more immoral? It is just pity that the movie needed to be adjusted for the US audience and the most meaningful parts got cut.As for acting - Jean Reno and Gary Oldman are two great actors (they're both amongst my favorites, btw), and together with beautiful, talented, young Natalie Portman, they form a trio that will make you feel like you really are there, in the movie with them.Final word - be open minded while watching this movie!

682,golfer10928,Excellent,8,23 June 2017,"Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - ""It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality"" as Gary Oldman very well put it.In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments"". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable ""EVERYONE!"" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled - just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: ""everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid"" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in ""real life""? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact.",Léon - The Professional
683,snakej32,An Unintentionally Hilarious Comedy,6,4 April 2004,"Hilarious, I have more laughs watching this movie with my friends than anything, think about it: The overly done stupid Milk thing, the whole first scene with things like: Leon randomly being in a vent to kill some guy when he was just on the stairs less than a minute before, when the balcony window closes hes somehow shooting towards it when he clearly isnt on the balcony which means he must be floating in the air in front of the building, him magically appearing and disappearing in a dark hallway in the beginning as well as his arm stretching when he backs up from the fat guy, the guys they try to pass off as D.E.A. (like the white Jamacan guy with a machine gun who empties his whole clip wildly in a small apartment or a guy who can sniff peoples lies and is high on drugs all the time) the whole pig in the kitchen thing (HES A HITMAN CMON), him taking in and training a little 12 year old girl who aspires to be a cleaner and having a strange relationship with her (if you see the uncut version the restaraunt scene is....strange) AND THEN HE GOES ON HITS WITH HER TOO, AND SHE USES A SILENCED PAINTBALL GUN! And has anyone looked closely at his choice of style? If you look you can see that his pants come up to his ankles and he wears knee socks haha, i'm sure thats what real hitmen dress like. Also, him using double pistols upsidown to kill a whole swat team, him surviving a grenade in a tiny apartment that hit right next to him (just by doing his hilarious ""AHHHHHHHHHHHH"" and diving a few feet to his side)and then him being able to recover from the blast with almost no injuries and then changing into an entire swat uniform in under 30 seconds. Also, Leon not noticing (in a totally empty hallway) that someone is following him with a gun (in a huge empty hallway you could surely hear someone else's footsteps, especially when they are right behind you.)If you want to see a good movie about a hitman watch Ghost Dog or even Road to Perdition. And Reno is damn good in La Femme Nikita as Victor, that's how a real ""cleaner"" would be, not a compassionate pedaphilic aging man who loves milk and plays with a pig ovenmit like Leon. I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie I liked it, but that was before I realized all of it's inconsistencies, if you watch it more than once it becomes more of a comedy, go ahead watch it again and really analyze it, I'm sure there's even more stuff I left out",Léon - The Professional
684,amoghhlgr,One of those movies that remain stuck to mind,10,1 January 2013,"I watched this film on DVD that I borrowed from my friend, who recommended it after I asked him for some refreshing thriller, but I ended up getting something more than that. It's just brilliant in every aspect - from casting to call, and from beginning to end, without a little distraction in between. Luc Besson has done a good job, and Gary Oldman! My god! Why didn't he win an Oscar for this role? Jean Reno did a terrific acting and so did the young Natalie.What starts off as an introduction to the 'cleaner' takes a whole new direction as the girl meets our Hit-man. Then comes Norman, the bad-ass cop, for a drug related issue with the girl's father. A murderous scene that sets in so naturally that I felt I was in that room. The girl is fortunately safe and credit goes to her mother who sent her to the grocery and Leon who allows her inside after she seeks help witnessing the aftermath.Later on I thought the story between Leon and Mathalda would go somewhat like Terminator-Judgement Day. But there was something even more special. Leon is losing his murderous instinct bit by bit as he grows into a 'Caretaker' and Mathalda loses her craze for killing and adulthood again a bit by bit. The way the climax has been written and presented, boy! 200 cops on one man, and still they struggle to take him out until he finally sacrifices his life to save the pretty girl. Every thing in the middle, that I've left out is something that I can only feel from the experience of watching this movie. Natalie Portman is now a huge star, and she deserves her stardom and acclaim after having acted like this in her very first film, and remember its no small film.It's a type of movie that I get to watch on rare occasions. Something that remains stuck in my mind after days of watching!",Léon - The Professional
685,nilayduygun,Don't die not to watch this film!,10,10 December 2012,"""The Professional"" is one of my favorite films. It is deliberately amazing, so I am fall in love with this film. Can a person fall in love with a film? Yes, I am. Despite the fact that 18 years have passed since the release of the film, its fame is still intact, and it is still watched by many person, also I am one of them. I watch it again and again. It makes me cry whenever I watch it especially, at the end of the film. Intercalarily, I love its soundtrack so much, because its melody affects me so bad. The film shows that there is a real love. One can understand the real love from relationship between Mathilda and Leon. Why I love Jean Reno is this film, and also I admire acting of Natalie Portman even she is at a young age in the film. My advice to anyone is that do not die not to watch this film!",Léon - The Professional

687,Alex_Pete_Georgie_Dim,"Yes, it's Good, But...",8,7 April 2013,"When I first heard of this movie, I really thought I was gonna be blown away. An assassin taking care of a little girl after her family is killed? Awesome premise! Gary Oldman as the villain? Even better! Can't wait to watch it! And now that I've seen it... Yeah, it was good, but there are definitely some flaws.The films strength is the relationship between Leon and the girl Matilda. Jean Reno does a great job as the socially awkward assassin Leon, and its a shame he hasn't gone on to do anything big after this. Natalie Portman also does well as Matilda, and the both of them form a nice father-daughter relationship. I saw the theatrical cut, but I have seen the scenes from the international release, I prefer the theatrical as the international scenes ruin this relationship. But anyway, when the film focuses on this relationship and Leon's ""professional"" skills, it's great, but it isn't always focused on that. It sometimes focuses on the main villain, a DEA agent played by Gary OldmanGary Oldman apparently receives a lot of praise for this role, and I really can't see why. He is constantly yelling and making these weird faces, which contrasts strangely with Reno and Portmans more serious performances. Reno and Portman draw you into the film, and then all of a sudden Oldman bursts in and turns the whole thing into that remake of Bad Lieutenant (yes, the one with Nicolas Cage). That performance works only if the rest of the film is tailored in that style, and The Professional certainly isn't.But, like I said, it is still very good, and definitely worth the watch. Even some of the Gary Oldman parts can be laughed at over the ridiculousness of his performance. All in all, a very solid and enjoyable film. If you are considering watching it, consider this a recommendation.",Léon - The Professional
688,richiegregson,Extended version ruins the original for me,4,15 February 2021,I'm not sure if I have missed the point of this extended cut. I saw the original theatrical release and absolutely loved it. I owned this version on DVD and then watched the extended cut in dismay. I can't be the only one out there who thinks this has changed the entire feel of the film for the worse. The original release played more on Mathilda's (unreciprocated) romantic feelings for Leon whilst the extended release becomes something altogether more uncomfortable to watch. I won't be watching this again in a hurry. Do yourself a favour and watch the original version.,Léon - The Professional
689,forthosewhowait94,Excellent film with a gripping story!,10,22 August 2013,"This film is absolutely brilliant and amazing! It is truly a unique film with fantastic acting and action that will hold you in its grasp. Where are the awards for this film? How come this film is unnoticed? With all of the amazing acting and great storyline, I am surprised this movie did not win an Oscar! Everybody was fantastic in this film! Jean Reno gives a heartwarming performance as a sad and lonely hit-man or ""cleaner"" named Leon who lives in a secluded world in a apartment complex and Natalie Portman's character Mathilda is the one that shatters Leon's secluded world.For this being her first feature film, Natalie Portman gives an amazing and astonishing performance as a troubled little girl with a desire for revenge. Gary Oldman is also fantastic as a twisted, sadistic, and corrupted DEA agent. He is on my list for Top 10 greatest villains ever! The unique love story and father-daughter type relationship between Leon and Mathilda is handled beautifully by director Luc Besson. You will feel so much sympathy for these characters. This movie is the perfect action with a unique love story and unforgettable characters and emotionally charged scenes! Everybody needs to see this movie!",Léon - The Professional
690,jigsta212,Leon:The Professional is a delicate balance of Emotion/Action for the Intelligent,10,14 February 2005,"Having seen this film three or four times now, I am beginning to contemplate the excellent aesthetic depth this film has to offer. Natalie Portman, like Rachel McAdams in The Notebook, was perfectly cast as Mathilda. I believe any other young actress could not have conveyed the extraordinary performance which was required of such a young leading role. I hate to say, but most films can't even come close to Stanislavsky truth like Jean Reno and Portman beautifully delivered in Leon The Professional. The Music is also wonderfully placed as well as it is playful. Gary Oldman portrays the perfect antagonist-pretty much you hate him and want him for dead making his acting right on target, so no complaints there. So all in all I absolutely love Leon The Professional. It is definitely not for those who despise films that have some valid emotional complexities in it. For those with drone-like minds go watch Battlefield Earth or Cyborg or something-",Léon - The Professional
691,label-lover,I don't think I have ever seen a movie more than I have Léon: The Professional,10,22 January 2016,"LTP speaks to me, not only through dialogue, camera or score but through aesthetic. Yes, aesthetic. LTP has influenced every fiber of my (aesthetical?) being since first being exposed to it at age nine when I tried to grow Leon's beard. I couldn't believe it when my mum told me that growing a beard would be impossible. With my dreams crushed, I swore LTP out of my life forever. I revisited it again at age thirteen, convinced that I was at the peak of mental maturity and beard-growing abilities. I believed I understood this film on a deep- artistic-philosophical level, I wrote personal essays on the films philosophical merit for high-school, I recommended it to all of my tween friends but then assured them that they ""probably wouldn't understand it's depth anyway"". In attempt to find people who just GOT the film y'know, I turned to the streets; making alleyway handshake deals of USB's containing a pirated LTP movie file to other like-minded intellectuals. ""Trust me Gustav, all it takes is just one taste,"" I said to Gustav, ""Please leave me alone weird short red-head girl, I don't know you. And my name is Jeremy!"" Jere-Gustav replied. That Gustav always had a sense of humour. Anyway, it didn't really work out, not even the streets were ready.At fifteen I watched LTP three more times within that year. With what little pocket money I had, I bought a replica of Léon's sunglasses, beanie and the little pot plant that Mathilda had. I even wore my dad's old black coat for dramatic effect, shoulder pads still intact. I also had decided to postpone my deep-philosophical- artistic tirade attempts; instead I focused solely on channeling my Inner Léon Look. Sixteen years old, I was dedicated to replicating Léon as a person. I tried taking stray children under my wing, knocking on apartment complex doors screaming for Mathilda or the male equivalent; Mathias. Neither was found. I suppressed my many crushed hopes and dreams by watching LTP four more times, within a week.It wasn't until I was seventeen that I realised I had forgotten my original wayward ways; I no longer thought about the philosophy of LTP, or the mind bending obstacles it creates for the viewer to ponder over, or even the foreshadowing that we will forever wish we thought of first as a stylistic device. Now at almost nineteen, I realise this is probably because Léon: The Professional doesn't truly quell any hidden meanings to decipher. It's simply put; a goddamn awesome action flick that focuses on a father/daughter like relationship and ends with sweet sweet avenged death. A film/movie/flick doesn't need to bend the laws of physics itself to be rated five out of five stars or ten out of ten stars or one hundred fresh tomatoes. My former years were wasted trying to justify why I loved it so much, when I just needed to accept the fact it was no 2001: A Space Odyssey, and that's okay. It explains why I have stuck with the Léon aesthetic. This isn't really a review, just a long-winded story about how I came to a conclusion about my feelings for this movie.TLDR: Renno and Portman r gr8, story is cool, not that deep, aesthetic is nice, Luc Besson is an everyday genius, boom bang, cry, fin.

693,martoff1,Leon is the man!,9,19 July 2005,"I just recently bought the European version (Leon) and wow.I would greatly recommend it.I love the cinematography on this one.This shows New York in its gritty self reminiscent of Taxi Driver. I love Gary Oldman as the psychotic DEA officer, no one else would have given that type of a performance.Also there was a balancing act of keeping a seriousness to the story as well.If given to the wrong hands it could have been a silly movie.Jean Reno was at a perfect age to play Leon.He has a worn down look but moved swiftly and not slick or cool.Portman probably played her best role in her career in this.I am surprised she hasn't had a better one since.Danny Aiello was an obvious pick as Tony.Any time your looking for something Italian and in New York he's the man.The action sequences were done flawlessly like a ballet or something.The soundtrack was also blended well with the story too.This to me is great movie making in raw form.No big CGI spectacles, no huge Hollywood names just good talent overall.",Léon - The Professional
694,sadmanhasan,One of the masterpieces of the 90s,9,2 November 2016,"Leon is one of the most underrated movies of all time to my understanding. The protagonists in the movie were at their best playing this movie.The build up to the story is impeccable as we can see a glimpse into the main man's life story. It does seem a bit waylay at first starting the movie but as the time goes by things are put in places in a very subtle and flawless way.Leon is more of a thriller which doesn't necessarily have the complexion to the story as one might expect but it has way more ingredients to the story than the genre of the movie itself. The slow-building relationship between Leon and Mathilda is very well portrayed. Leon has earned cynicism at the time of its release and it seems pretty justifiable since it shows a sexual tension between a middle-aged man and a thirteen-year-old girl. Although it shows predominantly one-sided attraction it plays a great deal in the story. However, judging the context, the tension makes the movie somewhat exceptional than an ordinary piece of drama.The thing which stands out about the Leon is the fact how the actors in the movie played a significant role to make this movie worth a watch. Natalie Portman was age-defying and magnificent in playing her character. No wonder she became a huge success in the industry. It's very hard to expect the kind of performance being put in by an actress of such a young age. Jean Reno kept the simplicity of the character with his talent. Lastly, the praise will remain unfinished if not a word is spoken about Gary Oldman's brilliant cameo. It was enthralling to see Gary Oldman at his best putting in such a flawless performance. This was surely one of Gary's best work in his whole acting career.Leon is the kind of movie that will keep the audience enticed and uptight the whole duration of the movie. After so many years since its release, I suppose it still remains worthwhile to watch.",Léon - The Professional

I don't know that the director was on, or the writers/producers. Must have been crack, or maybe Jimmy savil wrote this. And why isn't she wearing normal clothes in the entire movie.? She's dressed like a hooker! I just think it's really inappropriate I do understand the Leon doesn't return her advances, but he doesn't stop them either. And some of the stuff she says is so uncomfortable I'm shocked so many people have watched it. I for one think that even though the storyline is good, poor Natalie Portmans childhood was ruined",Léon - The Professional
696,niths-87710,Leon,8,1 October 2016,"The film opens with one of those virtuoso shots which zips down the streets of New York and in through a door, coming to a sudden halt at a plate of Italian food and then looking up at its owner. Besson must have been watching the opening of the old Letterman show. The man eating the food is a mob boss, played by Danny Aiello, who wants to put a contract on a guy. The man who has come whizzing through the streets is Leon (Jean Reno), a skillful but uneducated ""cleaner,"" or professional hit-man But always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action.I have now started finding better movies through www.flicks tree.com.

Luc Besson's mix of offbeat characters, humour and high octane action tends to be a little hit and miss, but in Leon he found the perfect balance between sensitive character study, emotion and tense action sequences. Pot plant loving, milk drinking loner Reno is the antithesis of the usual testosterone-soaked, gung-ho action hero and with no glib one liners or macho posturing, he takes no pleasure in the mayhem he induces; he's just very, very good at it. His relationship with a young Natalie Portman is sincere, funny and touching, and although emotionally ambiguous (at least from her adolescent point of view), it never crosses the line into sexual creepiness. Complimented by an excellent supporting cast, especially pill popping psychopath Gary Oldman who is the perfect foil for Reno's solitary hit-man, and wonderfully scored Leon is easily Besson's best work and one of the best action thrillers around.",Léon - The Professional

703,flumpmonkey-1,Open-minded Review,9,12 October 2006,"I've been on a bit of a depressing binge recently, picking many movies I like and reading the most negative reviews I could find on them. I have to admit, I couldn't really accept why I liked this film so much, seeing as I enjoy great acting more than anything and the most lines in the film (give or take) were given to a twelve-year-old, who, like so many others her age, has trouble acting her age.However, I finally saw what I enjoyed so much about this film and had to give myself a pat on the back. Portman's acting was due to her lines, not her demeanor. She had to act as an adult in this film, albeit it took the realistic credibility away from the character and somewhat from the film. Looking past that, I realized that the relationship between Leon and Mathilda, which so many of the negative reviews I read trashed, was based on the very real emotions of a man dedicating his life to death and loneliness and a girl with nothing and no one left to confide in except her savior--Leon himself.I don't particularly believe in much of Freud's work, but the ""every son is in love with his mother"" argument seems to come into play here, especially considering this ""mother"" is so easy to idolize--cool identity, cool job, great ability (the U.S. version wasn't called ""The Professional"" for nothing)--not to mention her adult-like attitude towards life clashes so easily with her childish one-track mind...kill the killers, then become an assassin. What is unrealistic about that to a child; moreover, a child taken in by a hit-man? Unfortunately, the argument that this love between Leon and Mathilda is the downfall of the movie must end, seeing as Leon is killed and Mathilda returned to her normal life before anything can become of it.I salute all of you who commented negatively on this...you gave me the ability to see what I love about this film and the content for a much more open-minded review.",Léon - The Professional

The underlying simplicity of a bad cop (actually a purely evil cop) and a sympathetic hit-man is splendid.Whilst there are rumoured versions that ""reveal more of the relationship between Reno and Portman"", the release version is a stunning piece of cinema with a gloriously climatic conclusion.",Léon - The Professional

708,roberto-10,Viewpoint on an American French Film,10,13 November 1998,"Luc Besson is a French Director/Producer and his American film The Professional (Leon) is an excellent example of the quality of films we could get from Hollywood if more producers were worried about quality than money.The Professional starts by showing ""a day in the life"" of hitman Leon (Jean Reno) as he ""executes"" a job given to him by his Italian contact Tony. Excellent cinematography, the violence is presented in a way that is not meant to shock.  Jean Reno, although his is French, speaks excellent English and his accent is toted as being Italian.  He portrays his character very well.   He is not an uncompassionate hired killer, but instead takes special care of his best friend, a house plant, and watches old movies at the theatre.We next meet Mathilda, a 12 year-old in an abusive home where the mother is a whore and the father is mixed up in drugs.  It is easy to understand why she is not upset when her family is gunned down by druglords, except for the loss of her 4 year-old brother.  Leon grudgingly takes her in and, after an internal struggle, decides to take care of her.This is a non-conventional love story of the emotions that grow between Mathilda and Leon and the way their love leads to what will eventually end up being the best for Mathilda.  A tragic story in the traditional French vein.",Léon - The Professional
709,nimja,As good as it gets in the genre!,10,10 February 1999,"Luc Besson has a wonderful eye and it is demonstrated again and again in this film.  It's an unusual mix of Thriller/action and family/romance.  More family than romance with the relationship that develops between a young girl and a seasoned Assassin.  Unfortunately the violence and swearing does attract an R Rating in Australia.A must for humanists who believe that Assassins can have feelings and who feel for the loneliness this profession would create.  Gary Oldman plays a role we are familiar seeing him in: a psychotic killer (actually an undercover cop)- hey he does it well!  Jean Reno (Leon) is both lovable and lethal; most of all convincing as the Assassin with honour and standards. Natalie Portman as the 12 year old Mathilda is cute, loveable and delightfully naughty:  I think we'll be seeing more of her in the future- very talented.  The rest of the cast are mostly type-cast but it all melds well to make this a well rounded albeit hard to box motion picture.

714,huckster-2,An excellent movie,10,25 April 1999,"I saw ""The Professional"" for the first time recently, and the experience was indescribable.  All of the elements of this film mesh together so exquisitely: directing, writing, cinematography, and acting.""The Professional"" is a slick pseudo-action film about Matilda (Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl whose family is gunned down by double-crossed DEA agent (Gary Oldman), over a drug dispute.  Matilda happened to be out buying groceries at the moment, and comes home before the thugs leave. She sees that her family is dead, but walks past, pretending not to notice. Instead, she knocks on a neighbor's door in search of sanctuary.  The neighbor, Leon, (Jean Reno) reluctantly lets her in.  She soon finds out that Leon is in fact a hitman.  She convinces him that he is now responsible for her life since he saved it, and she asks him to teach her to be a ""cleaner"" like him so she can avenge her brother's death.  Leon eventually agrees, and Matilda ends up teaching the reclusive Leon a few things about living.All of the acting was superlative, especially Portman in the role of the streetwise Matilda.  One thing I really liked about the movie that I think most people misunderstand is the relationship between Leon and Matilda. The way I saw it, they both loved each other, but Leon's love was a father's love for his daughter.One last note: I have heard about the director's cut, but in my opinion it is not as good as the edited version.  The director's cut (according to what I heard) extremely overplays Matilda's seduction of Leon, a subject that wasn't even covered in the edited version.  This results in a loss of the ambiguity of their relationship, which is what I really liked about it.In short, that was why the movie worked so well: it was just ambiguous enough that it kept you guessing, even after you have finished watching it. This movie makes you think.",Léon - The Professional
715,Methos-7,Gripping story with well-crafted characters,10,16 May 1999,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie.",Léon - The Professional
716,Cmsanghv,Highly Overrated!,1,8 April 2014,"This movie is a good example of the pitfalls of relying on user reviews/ ratings for selecting movies to watch. By no stretch of imagination should this movie have been in the Top 250 list or anywhere even close to it.The acting and direction were poor, the story very lacklustre, unimaginative and predictable and many of the scenes were downright ludicrous.Leon appears retarded in many scenes but an attempt is made to depict him as an intelligent person.Some of the scenes will require you to suspend disbelief - one of them being a rocket launcher being fired at an apartment from inside the building by cops!",Léon - The Professional

And to see Jean Reno as the brilliant hit-man who ""cleans""!To see all the symbolic actions in the film, and to see how Natalie Portman truly gives her soul into making this film (her first!), and how she really i devoted to make this a great film...If you should see this film, make sure to notice the plant, the girl, the hit-man and the milk - notice ALL what it represents to get the complete and deeper meaning of this film . . .Luc Besson - Keep it up..... !",Léon - The Professional
719,robbijean,An Action Film For Lovers,10,24 November 2000,"With enough blood and gore to please any fan of action movies, and a unique love story to please the ladies, this is a great movie for couples to watch together. However, to truly comprehend the beauty of this film, you must see the European Cut.The U.S. version is still a great movie, but it cuts out 24 minutes which contain much of the heart of the movie and most of what makes the film a work of art instead of the usual action fodder. Elements of the story which are only hinted at in the U.S. cut become the centerpiece of the story when the un-cut version is seen.The two main characters are a recently-orphaned girl who is wise beyond her years and a hitman who is still an innocent. Their relationship unfolds against a backdrop of murder and revenge as director Luc Besson explores issues of age and maturity, good and evil, and the interplay of life, death and love.The acting in this film is superb. Reno has an expressive face which conveys a myriad of emotions with great sensitivity and few words. He is cold as ice as the almost super-human 'professional', but his performance is most moving when he reveals his sensitive side. Watching as his wounded soul slowly begins to heal is enough to touch the heart of any woman, but it is handled so subtly that it never becomes too 'sappy'.In her film debut, Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief. She manages the transition from a  frightened child to a woman capable of killing so convincingly that it makes the relationship between she and Leon not only believable, but understandable.Gary Oldman is just the best psycho there is, and it is kind of nice to see him without all the strange makeup for a change. As a dirty cop in this film he personifies evil, and it is a joy to watch him do his thing.The special effects are all you could hope for. Besson does great actions scenes - especially the explosions. There is also a lot of humor and when you throw in the tender love story -  this picture has it all!",Léon - The Professional

The performance be Natalie Portman has to be the best child performance I have ever seen, while the first 30 minutes leaves you emotionally drained yet wanting more. The only thing wrong might be the ending which goes for a gung-ho extravaganza, but it is mainly the character interaction which is the focal point of the movie.

Natalie Portman is most excellent, becoming one with Mathilda, and Jean Reno's face is so expressive, it genuinely conveys the depth of his emotions without a hint of falsiness. I would also like to acknowledge Sting's beautiful song 'Shape of my heart,' which is very moving and touching as a final note of the movie. Altogether, it's a brilliant piece of cinematography, which explores the beauty of human spirit, and it is definitely one of the best movies I ever saw.",Léon - The Professional

I have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed.  It's not the violence or action sequences that make this movie so great (although they are well done...), but rather moments like where Mathilda knocks on Leon's door.  It would be so easy to just film the door opening, but instead we see light illuminating Natalie Portman's face, symbolizing something angelic.  And the moment has so much more meaning.I know a lot of people who have seen this film because they are action fans. I'm not.

First of all how are Gary Oldman and all of his henchman cops?? Why does Oldman have the power to call 500 cops in full body armor and fire rocket launchers in the middle of NYC?!

Gary Oldman was phenomenal, and this was Natalie Portman's first acting credit, and she did so well considering how young she was. But that also segues into the main and irredeemable issue with this movie; Leon and Mathilda's relationship.Mathilda is insanely sexualized and Leon honestly doesn't do a ton to dismiss her feelings toward him. The movie on its own is disturbing, but knowing that Luc Besson married and impregnated a 15 year old girl when he was 31 really sheds a lot more light on the situation. In the international version of the film there are a lot more sexual situations with Leon and Mathilda, and in the original script, Besson went so far as to write in the two of them having sex. It's clear that this film is a reflection of Besson's own deranged life, and unfortunately the spectacular performances and every other great aspect of the film that garnered significant critical acclaim cannot redeem the film. I simply cannot overlook the depravity of a pedophilic relationship, portrayed as some beautiful thing.",Léon - The Professional
729,ptorranc,a modern myth of salvation and redemption,10,27 February 2001,"Some have objected to the supposed sexual undertones in this movie; to me, the undertones are much more about salvation, rescue, attachment, and a modern myth of the prince who saves the innocent (but very capable and assertive) maiden from the evil abroad in the world. The action scenes are thrilling and very well done; more importantly, they are woven into a comprehensive tale of high moral value. In the end, the love between the maiden and the prince is pure and sacrificial.The relation to the movie Ghost Dog; the way of the samurai is interesting. The latter movie is also one of salvation and redemption, somewhat more overtly spiritual but aimed in the same direction. They make a great set.",Léon - The Professional

Well, Leon respects all of this, and with all that in mind, it's important to note that although only about a quarter of the film is action-packed, it's also so well done and impressive that it has made the film one of the best of its genre. Is. For example, the film's opening action, in which Leon must frighten the fat criminal, is dedicated to paying Leon as a professional and ruthless assassin. This sequence includes all the familiar features of a movie killer. In these moments, the main character of the film is not Leon, but his goal. We feel the fear of being attacked by a murderer like Leon instead of him. We realize that Leon is doing so well that he is acting more than a human being, like a wicked spirit with no walls blocking his way. Smoky glasses prevent us from seeing his eyes and entering him.

The standout scene in the movie for my money is in the bathroom the way that Stansfield (Oldman) is stroking Matildas (Portman) Face with his gun it just shows how disturbing the character is and will stop at nothing to get what he wants.

While I enjoyed both of those movies immensely, I hated the dialogue, especially between her and Anakin).I saw the uncut version, and from what I've read, the US cut (""The Professional"") removes all of the tenderness between Leon and Matilda. Squeemish MPAA viewers who don't like the relationship between Leon and Matilda removed the film's most important parts (and for worried viewers out there- don't worry, nothing ""happens"", but their love is very well played, and quite believable).So anyway- see this movie, but the uncut version, not the US cut.

If you haven't seen it, forget anything else until you have.  And try to make sure you see the directors cut with the extra 24 minutes of footage.In the UK, you will need to get the film imported to get hold of this but it is so worth the effort.I have never seen such a complete film. Acting, plot, action.  This film has it all.  Subtle and explosive at once.Nathalie Portman shines with the promise that would seem to have since been fulfilled.  Gary Oldman is chilling.  Jean Reno is outstanding.  Just as you start to believe the character is actually quite 'slow' he goes off on a job and works with such ruthless efficiency it becomes a lesson in the value of never underestimating any individual you ever meet.The plot is engrossing and yet manages to set off one or two uncomfortable alarm bells within you as you watch Leon trying to come to terms with exactly how he feels for Mathilda.  It always manages to stay very firmly on the correct side of the line though due to some superb scripting and subtle direction.The cut version is still a great movie but try to hold out for the full version.

I didn't even recognize her as the same dis-engaged pretty face that she has become. Okay, do I really have to write ten lines about the film? I highly recommend it based on Portman's performance alone. Also, the interaction between her character Mathilda--a twelve-year-old--and Jean Reno's Leon is at once touching and horrifying, given the nature of the material. Is Leon criticizing Mathilda for talking to the boy in the street and her liberal use of profanity as a father-figure, or because he's training her to be the ""professional cleaner"" she wants to become. Portman really does steal the show, though. Her ease with delivering her lines, many quite profane and vulgar, is amazing.

Anyway I must admit the Marseillaise is the one and only anthem that deserves being called 'anthem'. The Marseillaise is the anthem per se. And Léon is the movie per se. How else could a virile man happen to start crying watching an action movie? How else could a sophisticated man fall in love with a child? Or a tantalized pacifist's soul feel itself falling into murderous frenzy? With the means of his cinematic language Luc Besson sneaks under our skin, ignoring any mental or emotional barriers. During the movie our eyes our not the window to peek at our soul but the gateway to enter it. Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and the Dieffenbachia realize the story so frankly and straightforward that the brilliance of the story completely blends into the authenticity of the impression.

I mean don't get me wrong, the film was pretty good, but I really do not think it is worthy enough to be in the top 250. Jean Reno seems rather goofy at times even though his character is supposed to be a ""professional killer"". However, the last 45 minutes of the film are very well done. I really began to feel for jean and natalie, even though their relationship was rather odd(a 40 year old man with a 12 year old girl).

766,Baldyy,A Beautiful Anomaly,9,9 August 2010,"""The Professional"" is one of the most interesting movies I have ever seen. There are about a million things that Besson does to make this movie so one-of-a-kind that you may not notice until the second or third time around. The plot is fantastic in that it continually takes turns towards less desirable paths, which makes the movie all the more intriguing. Rarely does a film successfully walk the tightrope of mildly disturbing without falling into the pit of immorality and pervertedness, but Besson manages to make both Mathilda and Leon likable and peculiar without crossing the line of dementia.Watching this movie the first time through, I cringed at the sight of Mathilda in any type of adult situation, especially sexually. After watching it time after time, her mannerisms began to captivate me, as she is no more a girl than a woman trapped in the body of a twelve year old. Besson is brilliant in his direction of Portman, as Natalie is incredible in her execution of her character. There are countless moments where her words or facial expressions send chills down my spine. The way the camera is placed on Mathilda is so captivating that it is impossible to look away, as much as you feel like you should. This movie almost makes me feel guilty for watching it, but there is nothing else like it; the emotional tensions are so high that it is impossible to resist. Never in my life have I seen such a young star so devoted to her character that it disturbs me; everything about their relationship feels real.The deeper meanings in this movie are also prominent, where love is the major contributor. Not only are there no boundaries to love, but the way Leon acts with Mathilda vs. without her accentuates the fact that without love, he has become nothing, just mere existence. The back-story of his lover and the Russian Roulette scene are key in portraying this theme and Portman performs near perfect to get this point across, which makes the full length version of the film a necessity if not only for those two scenes.This film is not only a film-making masterpiece, but the actors feel so realistic that it's chilling. I have never some across an experience like this before and doubt I will again; this movie is undoubtedly one of the most important love stories I have ever seen, and it makes me think how necessary love is to life.",Léon - The Professional

769,artistpromoter,A film about our relationship with innocence,10,13 November 2011,"I first saw Leon a long time ago and decided to check it out again recently, which I saw the Director's Cut which is about the only director's cut of any movie which is better than the original. Leon takes place in a backward, corrupt version of New York city sometime in the modern day which is in fact the early to mid 1990s. The decade itself, coloured by Nirvana's angry Smells Like Teen Spirit and cries of protest against what had just been destroyed by the greed and gluttony of the previous era, Leon is a movie which deserves the trophy for most accurate in terms of how we approach modern urban living.Street children are often glamorised and sold back to themselves through corporate advertising campaigns, exploiting their youthful rage and earning millions from all of their troubled experiences. Rap music was coming up through the 1990s, and became popular, with a focus on the violent feud between Tupac Shakur and Biggie Smalls aka Notorious BIG.Kids were turning against the kinds of ""safe"" trends and towards something more dangerous towards the end of the decade, with hip hop music and grunge being the most powerful world changing genres of that decade in music. Leon is a very musical film, and as a musician, I deeply admire how it erupts and glides and moves like a piece of excellent sound.Despite the film's misunderstood perceived controversy, that of a young girl being adopted by a man whom she develops a crush on, this film is in fact a struggle between innocence and corruption.I'm not going to review this film in the way that other people will already have reviewed it, instead I am going to do what Roger Ebert did, which is to talk about how the movie made me feel, what the main themes are and my perspective on this movie culturally.The setting up of the music in the previous paragraphs gives you a suggestion that a film about a hit-man teaching a little girl how to shoot guns and take down human beings in a series of illegal murders paid for by the mob, is the kind of background upon which a rap artist might make his debut album.Grunge music may have been angry and aggressive, but it was also happy and joyous, it raged on and children raged with it, celebrated it, but were also plagued by the troubled side of the new artists. Kurt Cobain murdered himself, with a gun no less. He was arguably the most important force in rock music during the 1990s, perhaps since then.Matilda as a character is just normal, except we don't see characters like this (or didn't back then) depicted on the screen so honestly.If nothing else, this film is truthful. But rap music and grunge music, is both teenage fair, songs about killing people, about doing away with life or material possessions, about rape, murder, suicide, depression, were happening at the time of the film's release.The film came out in 1994, the year Cobain decided to shoot himself. Teenagers, particularly troubled teenagers, now had no one to follow. Matilda is one such troubled teen. She is caught between her inner knowledge of what she has felt and feels, her awakening into womanhood, and her childhood being ruined by oncoming adolescence, a bad family life and smoking.She is a typical child. So is Leon. Leon is innocent and only his job makes him have to be a bad person. He is essentially, like the other 3 main characters in the film, a contradiction; We have the obvious Gary Oldman as police officer being corrupt as a symbol of a man pretending to be a defender of justice, while being a criminal. He is bad but his job makes him seem legitimate.Leon is a good man doing very dirty work. His ""guilt"" is in what he does for money. He is kind and good natured in every other way. Again, this is millions of people in the corporate world who kill and have people killed, yet are wonderful family people, lovers, friends.Matilda's corruption is in what she has seen and heard, that she smokes, that she misses school on purpose, and that she wants to be a ""cleaner"" as well. She wants to run from what she is: a child.Leon meanwhile seems like he is trying to become innocent again. The two are in a dance between their bad selves and their good selves, we are never shown a black or white picture, just grey.The final character is Tony, a nice, kind, mobster. Again, we have a classic case of character vs role in society. Whereas Oldman's despicable police officer is cruel and evil towards other human beings, we see a hit-man and a mobster as being ""good"".Matilda is our own shaken sense of what we are today and what we have become emotionally. Torn between our innocent past and present day adulthood, we wish all children to be impossibly innocent yet they wish to grow up, and we wish to return to an innocence ourselves which, as the film has shown, was only ever one shade of a guilty grey.",Léon - The Professional

Let me tell you that I have never seen a film that blended all the elements of cinema so well. The act, score, storyline, and drama are all wonderfully crafted in this film. Luc Besson gave a gift to the world of cinema with this film. It is his best film in my opinion and I do enjoy his other films. I would like to state that I would rank this film with The Empire Strikes Back, King Kong, Desperado, Frankenstien, all of those I would give a perfect 10 too. I love this film so much, I own three different editions of this film on DVD. The Professional (US version) Leon, The Professional extended version and most recently the Deluxe Edition, which by far is the best. Not only does it have the best quality film and sound there is, it's also has special features including interview with Jean Reno and Natalie Portman. My only complaint is that Luc Besson himself is not interview or shown on the DVD. Another thing that bugs me is the fact that Natlie Portman said she would do a sequel, what is Luc not listening? Please I beg you make a the sequel! It's not just a great hit-man movie, it is so much more. I truly love this movie, but some will not like it's subject matter.

772,dermot_howard,Quality Action Classic!,9,12 November 2013,"This was truly an enjoyable action flick that stands tall due to great characters. The performances are the best thing about the movie. Be sure to view the international cut of the film, as the interactions are given more depth in this version.The performances are uniformly excellent. Jean Reno plays the tough guy role to a tee, and gives Leon extra depth and sensitivity. In limited screen time Gary Oldman is also excellent as the insane villain. But young Natalie Portman makes this movie. She brings a lively performance and has excellent chemistry with Reno. Despite her age, I believe she deserved a nomination at the Oscars for this. On the dialog front, The Professional also succeeds. There are entertaining one-liners, and all of the characters(especially Oldman's role) are well written.The film is more about character interaction than plot. The movie sets up its premise in the opening act, but for a time is plot less, focusing entirely on its characters. It returns to a plot driven narrative about 3/5 of the way through. I always prefer plot-based stories, but The Professional's plot is still well executed.The movie makes no attempt at realism, and despite being set in contemporary New York, feels like it is set in a completely new environment. Director Luc Benson establishes a unique atmosphere, and brings the characters to life nicely.The Professional has two major action sequences(one at the opening and another at the climax)and several small fights in between. Both the big battles are unique and exciting. They are also very emotionally intense due to the way the viewer cares for the characters.The Professional is a top-notch action movie. I would heavily recommend it to fans of the genre. Anyone who appreciates strong character development would also be advised to give this film a look.",Léon - The Professional

Gary's wired, drugged-out, sociopath DEA agent is a spectacle. the top down shots of him cracking the pills, not to mention the infamous ""EVERYONE!!!"" are forever etched on my memory.then there's Mathilda. for Portman to convey the sheer weight of that role, at her age, is nothing short of a minor miracle. she's... words don't so it justice. you just have to see it.so you may be wondering, ""if you liked the movie THAT much, why didn't you give it a ten instead of a nine?"" and it would be a fair question, which i will now answer.because i am now completely incapable of finding Natalie Portman attractive.every time i see her in an attractive outfit, i see innocent little 12-year-old Mathilda, dressed a little too provocatively for comfort, and my mind grinds to a halt. i know it's petty, but this movie has ruined the beauty that is Portman for me forever.",Léon - The Professional

He makes his living carrying out assassinations for numerous clients and is the best in his trade. His only contact besides from TOny, his mentor and ""manager"" is Mathilda (Natalie Portman), the disillusioned 12 year old daughter of his neighbors. His ascetic lifestyle is shattered forever when Mathildas family gets slaughtered by corrupt cops lead by psychotic Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman) while she is shopping.

Finally she tracks down the killers and Leon and Mathilda have to confront them in a final deadly showdown.What can be said about this movie that hasn't been said a thousand times? Theoretically nothing, but after having seen the Directors Cut just a few hours ago, I just have to talk (or rather write) about it. IF anyone else had done this movie, it would have probably degraded into a normal Hollywood action flick. But great acting by the entire cast, a great direction by Luc Besson make this movie a real benchmark for both action films an dramas! Jean Reno plays lonely and sad Leon with such a vigor that you almost believe that he IS Leon! Nathalie Portman goes even further and actually becomes Mathilda. She turns out such a heart wrenching performance as the confused scared and angry little girl that you can't help but shed tears at several places during the movie. As for Gary Oldman, well he was way over the top with Norman Stansfield but in a good way. I wanted to strangle that guy from the first time I saw him on screen! But it is the chemistry between Natalie Portman and Jean Reno that really makes this movie work. They LIVE their relationship without it ever turning into anything even remotely pedophile!! Camera-work is excellent, and gives this movie the feel of a classical painting! The action sequences are first rate.

780,deewgong-752-600590,"Starts off Excellent, Goes Downhill From There",6,12 June 2021,"Superb opening sequence. Leon really does come across as a professional, yet possesses a somewhat childish demeanour with other aspects of his life, and follows a strict regular regimen.The beginning of his acquaintance with Mathilda is emotionally up lifting: seeing him trying to help the bereaved Mathilda get back up on her feet was great.Natalie Portman's acting is superb.I also liked the cinematography, especially during the opening sequence.The cons:
The sexual tension between the 2 of them (or at least from Mathilda alone) is uncomfortable to say the least. Others may claim that Leon never did reciprocate, but there are 2 points to this: her actions alone are provocative enough; for instance claiming to the receptionist that they are ""lovers"". Leon also tells her he loves her and wants to spend the rest of his life with her in the end. Not to mention the constant showcasing of her bottom, scantily dressed clothing, etc. This may be ""normal"" to some people, but it shouldn't be.The thesis of the movie is supposedly centered around training Mathilda into a ""cleaner"" who is as good as Leon. Sure Leon does attempt to train Mathilda, and I can appreciate the time/scenes spent on depicting said training. But what was the training ever used for? Nothing! We never get to see Mathilda using her skills. The only thing she ever did was fire fake bullets and stick some gum on the peekholes of their targets. Massive letdown.What was the point of showing Leon being siphoned out of his earnings (or perhaps I was mistaken and his boss was honestly safeguarding it for him), Leon wanting to pass it on to Mathilda if he were to die, and then seeing Mathilda ending up in the restaurant with his boss offering to give her a hundred bucks a month? It does not add any sentimental, emotional, or purpose to the movie, apart from giving us the scene where Leon tells Mathilda that he has a bunch of money stored before letting her slide down the shaft.Underwhelming movie overall.

782,Xkinhe,Amazing Movie...,10,16 July 2015,"Besson seems fascinated by the ""Pygmalion"" story, by the notion of a feral street person who is transformed by education. He crosses that with what seems to be an obsession with women who kill as a profession. These are interesting themes, and if ""The Professional"" doesn't work with anything like the power of ""La Femme Nikita,"" it is because his heroine is 12 years old, and we cannot persuade ourselves to ignore that fact. It colors every scene, making some unlikely and others troubling. The film opens with one of those virtuoso shots which zips down the streets of New York and in through a door, coming to a sudden halt at a plate of Italian food and then looking up at its owner. Besson must have been watching the opening of the old Letterman show. The man eating the food is a mob boss, played by Danny Aiello, who wants to put a contract on a guy. The man who has come whizzing through the streets is Leon (Jean Reno), a skillful but uneducated ""cleaner,"" or professional hit-man. We see him at work, in opening scenes of startling violence and grim efficiency. In the course of the movie, Leon will, in effect, adopt his neighbor Matilda (Natalie Portman), a tough, streetwise, 12-year old girl. She escapes to Leon's nearby apartment after her family has been wiped out by a crooked top DEA enforcer named Stansfield (Gary Oldman), who wants to kill her too. Matilda wants to hire Leon to avenge the death of her little brother; in payment, she offers to do his laundry. Leon wants nothing to do with the girl, but she insists, and attaches herself like a leech. Eventually she develops an ambition to become a cleaner herself. And their fate plays out like those of many another couple on the lam, although with that 30-year age difference. Matilda is played with great resourcefulness by Portman, who is required by the role to be, in a way, stronger than Leon. She has seen so many sad and violent things in her short life, and in her dysfunctional family, that little in his life can surprise her. She's something like the Jodie Foster character in ""Taxi Driver,"" old for her years. Yet her references are mostly to movies: ""Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone,"" she tells him. ""Thelma and Louise didn't work alone. And they were the best."" (To find a 12-year old in 1994 who knows ""Bonnie and Clyde"" is so extraordinary that it almost makes everything else she does plausible.) So Leon finds himself saddled with a little sidekick, just when the manic Stansfield is waging a personal vendetta against him. Although ""The Professional"" bathes in grit and was shot in the scuzziest locations New York has to offer, it's a romantic fantasy, not a realistic crime picture. Besson's visual approach gives it a European look; he finds Paris in Manhattan. That air of slight displacement helps it get away with various improbabilities, as when Matilda teaches Leon to read (in a few days, apparently), or when Leon is able to foresee the movements of his enemies with almost psychic accuracy. This gift is useful during several action sequences in ""The Professional,"" when Leon, alone and surrounded by dozens if not hundreds of law officers, is able to conceal himself in just such a way that when the cops enter an apartment in just such a manner, he can swing down from the ceiling, say, and blast them. Or he can set a trap for them. Or he can apparently teleport himself from one part of an apartment to another; they think they have him cornered, but he's behind them. So many of the movie's shoot-outs unfold so conveniently for him that they seem choreographed. The Oldman character sometimes seems to set himself up to be outsmarted, while trying to sneak up on Leon in any way not actually involving chewing through the scenery. The premise ""La Femme Nikita"" was that its heroine began as a thoroughly uncivilized character without a decent bone in her body, and then, after society exploited her savagery, she was slowly civilized through the love of a good, simple man. ""The Professional"" uses similar elements, rearranged. It is a well-directed film, because Besson has a natural gift for plunging into drama with a charged-up visual style. And it is well acted. But always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action. In a more serious movie, or even in a human comedy like Cassavetes' ""Gloria,"" the child might not have been out of place. But in what is essentially an exercise - a slick urban thriller - it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it.",Léon - The Professional
783,joo-p-13-311642,When Love and Death Embrace,8,25 August 2014,"The lives of a professional killer and a little girl become entwined after a soft spot in the assassin's stony heart is exposed. The film has its reputation as an action movie (well it's about a contract killer), but the ninja-esque killing sequences are there to serve the plot, which they actually do, and well. Most of the movie is about building the relationship between the protagonists Léon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman).Léon has a realistic, but classy approach: there's no blood showers, slowed time, nor any other special effects involved in the action, or in anything else in the movie. I think this is to highlight the significance of death, both to the protagonist characters and to the audience. It's no show in real life, and there's no reversal to it. Once someone dies, there are not any flashing lights or magic, the world goes on with the dead one being a corpse in it. Léon, and later on, Mathilda don't fear that, and the shooting supports this view.This movie's forte is its casting that happens to be just perfect. Jean Reno seems to be in his element portraying expressionlessly the cynical hit-man, Léon. The way he acts, moves, and speaks truly depict an almost depressed man with nothing to lose until the very end. Gary Oldman, for his part, doesn't keep things as simple as Reno as Stansfield the antagonist. He plays the part of a drama queenish crooked-cop and complete maniac, being fit for the role. One could really believe the character has some serious issues. The young Natalie Portman completes the trinity of leading actors, and despite her then-age (only 12 y.o.), she succeeds in outshining them all! It's just fascinating to follow how everything she does is so natural and effortless. She doesn't just appear to be the unloved orphan girl turning into a ruthless predator seeking for her revenge, she IS her. Going through a scale of emotions in a faultless display, this movie really was a stepping stone to her to-be-stardom which she rightfully attained.On a deeper level, it's all about loss and beginning anew. The theme repeats itself in both Léon and Mathilda's fates. Without spoiling anything, keep an eye on the symbolic plant. Then there's the love and death that Mathilda constantly talks about in the movie. The love part was really confusing: in the beginning I thought Léon had a fatherly affection towards Mathilda - he protected her when no-one else didn't, yet turned down her advances. Later it turned out to be out of protection towards himself, but could have been more clearly explained, in my opinion. In addition, Mathilda saying: "" I'm not growing up anymore, I just get older"" seemed an odd piece of script regarding the movie wanted to show her to grow into a woman (or at least I think it wanted), she being a typical teenager in how she conducts herself. On the other hand, that's what a teen girl really would say.So, even though the acting in Léon is superb without overrating it a bit, there's plenty of good action, the tempo doesn't go particularly slow anywhere, and with there being these deep meanings behind the killing, why does it feel that the movie is somehow wanting? In a way, the plot starts before the movie and goes on after it ends, but that's not it. While writing this review I found out about the original script of the movie. It can be found here: http://the-professional.uw.hu/Version_1_Script.html Shortly said, after some research on the script, it turned out that The Professional was supposed to be more violent, the relationship between Léon and Mathilda more developed, and the movie in every way more complete, but Natalie Portman's parents wouldn't let her act in the movie if it wasn't rewritten, which is completely understandable, considering her age. It just leaves you wonder what would've been had the original idea come true.Anyhow, the big picture is entertaining and thought-provoking in itself. Even after seeing the flick, Léon had me thinking about what had happened in it, which cannot be said about many of its kind. Oh! A special mention for the milk drinking throughout the movie! Rating: 4/5",Léon - The Professional

I love it because it's about love, friendship and everything , what i otherwise don't think about enough times. This film won. The greatest award of my heart. And i think this opinion won't change. I know it doesn't matter to anyone, but i think i'm mature to share it with the most qualified professionals. The film's plot: Leon(Jean Reno), the cleaner lives alone, and doesn't care about anyone, but his plant. He lives in his own world, all about his job, his plant and Gene Kelly's films. When Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his gang kill the nearby family, he has to admit the 12-year-old girl Mathilda, the surviver of the carnage.

787,jpt-55594,Awesome movie,10,25 September 2017,"I remember watching this movie when i was young. It was one of those movies that I could watch everyday after school. The action was thrilling and I always wanted to be like Leon, a stone cold bad ass with a heart.About 20 years after I first saw The Professional I watched it again and it was awesome. It was awesome not because of the nostalgic feeling but because it is a movie that has stood the test of time. Its formula is simple but yet captivating. This is not your typical action movie of a buff guy of a pretty action star that was the norm in the early 90's but the protagonist is someone that is unassuming that epitomises the term ""silent killer"". Gary Oldman gives a masterclass performance as the main antagonist and Natalie Portman gives a performance that makes one question is she was truly a teenager or if she was older. The plot is intriguing and the pacing keeps you engaged, the stunts are believable and the action sequences will put modern movies to shame. The music is incredible and the characters have depth and humanized.Without giving out any spoilers this is a film that works in every perceivable way. An A+ for me",Léon - The Professional

I 'm surprised they let him film these scenes to be honest ... the flow/pacing issues the DC has is not the worst offender.

791,oephyx,Mastery of Crime and Drama,10,20 February 2006,"Luc Besson's Leon is blessed with so many qualities that it not only excels in its crime-thriller genre but also in the general art of cinematography.The french director stays simple in his brilliance, to deliver an intense but deeply human thriller. Filming is subtle and intelligent, with discreet special effects that give the movie a feel a realism. The composition is tight : the 110 minutes leave time to deliver a good plot, generous action and excellent character development.This is achieved by the excellent actors portraying the three main characters. Gary Oldman expertly becomes the butchery obsessed, corrupt DEA agent. Natalie Portman is a revelation playing 12 year-old Mathilda. She shows the complexity of a strong charactered abandoned girl in a seemingly effortless performance. Jean Reno is extraordinary as Leon, the killer who lives a life of paradox, between the violence of his employment and his apparent naivety. The unlikely formation of a link between the two latter characters is the heart of the movie, where the young girl gives Leon a taste of life.Leon is an exceptional film : combining suspense and drama, subtleness and brilliance, Luc Besson signs a masterful jewel of cinematography.",Léon - The Professional

I didn´t expect much when I got there, but when I left I had a strange feeling in my body. It caught me. Bessons cameratechnic is fantastic. Portman, Aiëllo and Oldman are very convincing. But what makes the diffrence is Jean Reno. France's far most talented actor. His shy professional acting makes one believe he never done anything else in his life. It was one of the best films I had ever seen. I even namned my bird Leon. When I in 97 laid my hands on the long version (released in Sweden, Denmark, France and a few more places. NOT USA!)

I love the violence, especially the revenge. Natalie Portman was absolutely perfect and will no doubt be a major screen presence in the near future. It also goes without saying that Gary Oldman is brilliantly evil as the bad cop, in fact, he brings new meaning to the term bad cop. He seems ahead of his time. My favorite camera shot is when Leon is falling to the ground after being shot and the camera is looking out through his eyes.",Léon - The Professional
796,Lothario,A great movie. Wonderful performances.,10,19 August 2000,"Jean Reno plays Leon, a hitman. Coldly efficient, cunning and extremely deadly. The movie begins with Leon performing a hit, killing without remorse and then going home. Leon leads a simple life, although he gets $5000/head, he leaves this money in the trust of his friend and employer Tony(Danny Aiello). He seems to live on two quarts of milk a day, sleeps sitting up, stays in a small flat, and exercises rigorously. His only companion is his plant, which he cares for meticulously. He has fallen into a comfortable routine and is at peace with himself.That all changes one day, when crooked DEA agents led by the supremely evil Stansfield(Gary Oldman in a waaay over the top performance) storm his next door neighbor's apartment in search of drugs. They slaughter everyone who lives there, save the tiny, 12 year old Mathilda(Natalie Portman in a heart rending performance). She slips by the DEA agents and goes to Leon for help. Against his better judgement, Leon takes her in  and this is where the real movie begins. The relationship between the cold, remorseless killer and the little girl who has aged beyond her years. Leon teaches her the ""Cleaning"" business and Mathilda shows Leon how to live again. Early in the film Mathilda asks Leon ""Is life always this hard, or is it just when you're a kid?"" and Leon coldly replies, ""Always like this."" We get the sense that Leon knows what he is talking about, that his life has taken so many wrong turns, that now he cares for nothing.Jean Reno is a revelation. I had previously only seen him in Ronin, and while I thought he was acceptable in that movie, his performance here goes leagues beyond what he did in that film. His Leon is portrayed as a calm, ruthless but also nervous and emotionally insecure assassin. In Natalie Portman, I am reminded of a very young Milla Jovovich, but perhaps that is because of foreknowledge of director Luc Bessons fondness for Ms. Jovovich. Natalie Portman gives an assured performance that is remarkable for one so young. Everything else I've seen her in, it appears her talents are wasted. (It is actually making me look forward to the next Star Wars movie). Gary Oldman's characterisation of Stansfield is so out of this world that it seems very out of place in this picture. Danny Aiello gives strong, stable support(as always).This is Luc Besson's strongest work out of the ones that I have seen (Fifth Element and the Messenger). I think his use of color, his compositions and stylization are great, but that sometimes he does not take the time or takes to get the elements and the performance just right. Hopefully he will continue to mature as a director.But these are minor quibbles and do not affect the overall impact of the film. I highly recommend this movie.****/*****",Léon - The Professional

Like almost everyone out there I liked this movie for it story, cast etc. I could go on and on about the great performances of the actors, great directing job, how it's a story of a ""bad guy"" doing a good thing, or a ""good guy"" doing a bad thing, etc.I am not going to sit here and preach about how little Mathilda was Exploited sexually, I am not going to be sitting here wondering about what happened to the families of the swat team members killed by Leon, and for sure I am not going to be wondering if DEA officer Stansfield went to hell. People, some of us are taking things too seriously, and at the same time we are taking things for what they are not. Just because little Mathilda had a crush on Leon doesn't mean that this is a pre-teen porn flick. Just because some people got killed, doesn't mean that you are watching evening news, with real guns.What we got here is a great story by Mr. Luc Besson. Story that he showed us Using such great actors as Natalie Portman, Jean Reno, Garry Oldman and Danny Aiello. And what is frustrating me is the fact that people, who value movies for what they are: Entertainment; are striped of the chance to see the whole story, as intended by storyteller - the director; just because somebody who was lucky enough to see the full version decided that this movie is something it is not. And for sure the one thing this movie is not is a disturbing picture.So now I am going to leave you here, for all of you got some thinking to do.And me?

It's talked about in other genre's like song (e.g. ""Don't Stand So Close To Me"" by The Police), why not the movies.It also needs to be in there b/c you learn so much more of the character of Leon.  In the US version, you would think he got into trouble b/c of a woman (like she screwed him over financially), but in this version you find out that that is as far from the truth as you can get.An excellent movie.

I was a little disappointed because it started so well but went downhill as soon as Leon met Matilda.  I didn't feel any realism for the partnership because I didn't believe the situation. One minute the girl was suffering the murder of her family, the next she seemed to be over it. It was laughable when Leon was teaching the girl how to become a 'cleaner'.Things just do not happen like that in real life. things need to be plausible to be believed, and I didn't believe much of it.where the film does pick up points for me is in the action scene towards the end.

While the opening action sequence is intriguing and quite stylishly impressive, the overall story is poorly conceived and rather absurd. Its value is greatly diminished by the acting and the stupid things the characters actually do in the script.Different events happen in this film that are completely inconceivable in what looks like a setting in the recent past, the present, or the near future. They are living in a familiar place, but the characters act like their brains are in an alternate universe. Leon, the professional, seems to be an intelligent and rational man, but it is ridiculous that he helps instigate Natalie Portman's character to cause many nonsensical events. The director then contrasts these stupid almost unfathomable actions by trying to make us identify with certain character's natural human emotions. I can't feel any emotions with the characters because apart with speaking the same language and living on Earth, they do many things that I feel are completely illogical.The writers seem to have wanted some comic relief in many parts of the film, but they are mostly unfunny and unnecessary.

Despite this film being an action classic, the action takes a backseat during most of the film for it to build the characters and relationship of Mathilda and Leon. You will feel uncomfortable at times, but you will still feel for these characters just as much. This film is an experience, it isn't a large scope like the modern day blockbusters. It is a film that is not slow, but takes time for it to develop its characters so in the end your heart is wrenched when Leon dies. Truly one of the most impactful character deaths in film I have ever seen. Then to see Mathilda, completely alone with no one in her life, go and plant his favorite plant into the ground to give it roots breaks my heart every time. This performances are phenomenal--Gary Oldman destroys this rule and is truly terrifying and off-putting.

829,semkac,Great Film Here,8,27 June 2020,"I am convinced anyone who doesn't like this film is trapped in a mainstream bubble of conventionality.
Praising this movie for the relation between Leon and Mathilda is evocative, triumphant and different,
This film is an exultation and especially so considering that director Luc Besson is a proven genius and has so much art to his name.Leon himself being otherwise a deep character and is even more endearing to watch since 13 year old girl wants him all the time. What really makes the movie is as I have said the originality of the relationship and the action.",Léon - The Professional
830,dogtmav,Violence was never so character driven,9,23 December 2020,"Honestly a unique movie
I honestly don't understand the few bad reviews of this movie. They made me watch it with lower expectations but I thoroughly enjoyed Leon on DVD. I think the casting was great and the actors and actress gave tremendous performances. I appreciate all the hard work and vision (uniqueness) the writer and director put into this film.
I think this movie will be one that people realize is great more and more with every passing year.
Bonus: the relationship is so frank and so unique.",Léon - The Professional
831,alirock76,BEST FILM EVER MADE!,10,28 July 2001,"I don't want to bore you all to death as I have for anyone that knows me. Since I first saw this film, everybody who knows me will tell you that, as as far as I'm concerned, this is the best film you'll ever see & furthermore I don't believe anyone will ever get close either( film-makers). It's an absolute classic fantastically shot, slick, stylish, realistic. Superb soundtrack coupled with exceptional acting across the board & believable characters. I really don't want to talk about the film as I do not believe I could ever do it justice. However, I will say that SEVEN, USUAL SUSPECTS, MATRIX, PULP FICTION, SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION & even SCARFACE do not compare to LEON it really is the complete works, the finished article. This is only my opinion, but I will say that whenever the conversation of all time great films has ever come up, of all those people, those who have watched LEON, not one of them( not one) has not rated LEON as one of their top 5 films of all time!!",Léon - The Professional

Objectively, this is an absolutely original, advanced, avant-garde film about an assassin who needs love but has never had it. That is when he meets his soul-mate and they fall for each other. I feel like all the praise comes simply from Natalie Portman and this uplifting aesthetic of having a little girl that dresses like an adult woman be this deprived man's side-kick/support/soul-mate/lover. Luc Besson should receive praise for this truthful and sensuous movie because at the end of the day it never bores and in fact it gives us amusement, violence and interest. A pretty interesting story being told here that is enhanced by feeling that humanity has advanced from the limitations and prejudices of old.Amazing job!",Léon - The Professional

I was caught up by the music Alt-J did about Mathilda and it was enough to watch the movie.Natalie was perfect for this film and its kind of sad thinking she had to deal with sexuality related to it. Although i didn't watched the international cut my perspective was that she filled the emotional gaps and lacks that Léon had and he filled the lack of purpose that Mathilda had after what happened (and kind of before to), to the point that for me it was really much more important this completeness and purpose that they had then if they were a couple or not.I think the action of the film was a little overwhelming and even comic at some points, although i can understand that the story is centered on a hitman. I just sense that that approach to it wasn't really the best for the film.",Léon - The Professional

I couldn't believe how this epic movie ""grabbed my heart"" and I was wordless after the end of it. I am still so impressed every time I watched it again and again. This was the first movie with Jan Reno starring I watched. He became one of my favorite actors with his ""simplicity"" of acting and being the good bad guy. Gary Oldman was brilliant with his mad behavior and strong powerful playing. The little Natalie was the ""icing on the cake"" and she was as good as it was Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone. So I strongly recommend this film to everyone who is looking for a big entertainment.",Léon - The Professional
840,mdn02,Fantastic,9,20 March 2007,"Leon (The professional) is well worth a watch anyone, whether you are an action fan or not.Leon is a hit-man at the top of his game, always completes his mission and never gets hurt, never gets caught. He charges $5,000 dollars a head, no women and no children, those are the rules. However he lives alone with little possessions, his only friend is a plant and he sleeps in a chair, next to his bed. However his life changes suddenly when his neighbour's ( a 12 year old Natalie Portman) whole family are killed by a bent cop and his team. She survives however, and runs to leon for help. He takes her in and teachers her how to become a hit-man to get revenge on the murderers. Yet a strange relationship of friendship and love unfolds between them and leon ends up having to rescue her once again as the bent cops find out her whereabouts.The film has little flaws and is a jolly good watch! The acting is superb, portman gives a fine performance of a child who's family has just been killed. Reno has little to say but is perfectly cast in the role has leon. However, the fine talents of Gary Oldman steal the show as a superb bent cop. With lines such as 'I like these clam little moments before th storm', where can you go wrong. This is easily his best performance ever and really terrifies the ordinance. The only flaw is the whole concept of leon teaching a 12 year old girl how to become a hit-man? Bit stupid really as she never kills anyone. BUt overall it is a masterpiece.",Léon - The Professional

Try that with your average American movie...My favorite city in the world, my favorite director and my favorite young actress teamed up with Mr. Cool himself, Jean Reno - what's not to love? If you haven't seen it, give it a chance, you won't regret it. Try not to read any spoilers or even just reviews. Just immerse yourself.It blew me away the first time and it still sends shivers down my spine just thinking about the uncut opening scene and the score used, not to mention the music at the beginning of the credits, which I won't name, in order not to spoil it for you.

It has many qualities of a great action movie, such as clever action scenes, big-time explosions, and lots of guns. However, unlike many popular action movies, such as Die Hard or Speed, this movie has well-developed, three-dimensional characters. When I think of action stars, Bruce Willis, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, etc., quality acting is not at the top of the list of things on my mind. However, ""Leon"" contains plenty of quality acting, including standout performances by Natalie Portman and villian Gary Oldman.However, this movie may not be for everyone. ""Leon"" can even be considered more of a drama than an action. And, the presence of a child along with the main character, assasin killer definitely holds the action down a notch throughout the entire middle of the movie.Overall, this is a great action movie and much more.

847,Marty79,A classic,10,10 March 2002,"This is without doubt a classic film in its original state. It is a touching story of an unique relationship. In the American version it is obvious that the audience haven't been deemed to have the stomach for anything like an un-PC subject.I find this strange, because although there is obviously a strong love between the two lead characters, there is nothing sleazy, or at anytime worrying about Leon's intentions towards Mathilda. I am sure that most young girls get a crush on an older man at some point, whether it be a teacher or whoever, and the fact that Leon takes Mathilda in and looks after her in his own simple way, gives her a sense that she is wanted in a way she never got from her family.Leon is a visual treat, Besson almost at his best. The story is told without rush, and has many hidden depths. Most of these are looked at further in the director's cut. All the roles are well played, although Oldman has a bad habit of over-acting, but still gets away with it.This film marks an end to Besson's golden era and the start of his Americanization and selling out in films like The Fifth Element, though still a good film.Leon is a must see film... 9.5/10",Léon - The Professional

I loved this movie from beginning to end; the ending was awesome! I know its almost impossible to recreate such a great movie... but it was so many years ago. Like all the Die Hard movies they all were pretty good, I can't think of one that sucked horribly. So I think another Professional starring Natalie and Gary Oldman would be awesome!!!!!! Shes all grown up now and I could just picture her as another Professional still bent on revenge! I think towards the end of The Professional there is great potential to cont. on with this story one more time.

854,erod2000,An absolute classic.,10,30 June 2009,"Luc Besson brings an impossible relationship between a cold-blooded assassin and a 12-year old orphaned girl to reality in this one. Natalie Portman's screen debut in a leading role was absolutely special. Definitely one of the best performances of any child actor in film history, if not the best. There isn't a young actress out there that could've played that role as effectively as Portman. The emotion she's able to summon from when she's looking for Leon to open the door after her family's been shot, to the entertaining charades game, to the intense scene with Stansfield in the bathroom, truly amazing. You can't help but feel empathy for her character. Vintage Gary Oldman playing the bad guy as the corrupt DEA officer, one of his best performances as an actor. His over the top nature made the film even more entertaining.Flat out one of the best movies of all time.

I wished Léon survived, but it would make an awkward future, and how would the strange relationship between a solitary hit-man and a 12-year-old child develop? I wished Mathilda would become a ""cleaner"" too, but then her life would be as tragic as Léon. The ending is sad, but reasonable, and I believe it's the best for both. Leon finally found the taste of life, and by the smile on his face while he was walking toward the door (while Stansfield was following him), we know that he has no regrets.I almost never watch a movie twice, but this one constantly urges me to pay it another (and I don't know yet how many more) visit.

858,kartik-kartikeya,Brilliant Performance by Natalie Portman,8,8 August 2010,"Truly a remarkable film and excellent performance by all the three major leads. From the very starting of the movie Leon(Jean Reno) has been portrayed a s a fearless cold-hearted hit-man and he has done his job well, while Mathilda(Natalie Portman , age 12) is a spoiled kid who lives with his father ad half- mother. She has done a brilliant job as a 12 year old kid and Stansfield (Gary Oldman) is a drug-addict corrupt DEA cop who as killed Mathilda's family.From there starts the chase. Mathilda is rescued by Leon who starts developing a liking for her and teaches her his trade......... the ""cleaning business"" and also protects her. It is the first time that someone started being nice to Mathilda and at such an adolescent stage she started developing love for Leon. At this point she is been depicted somewhat like Lolita and she played her part well.While on the other hand when Stansfield get to know that there is someone out there trying to kill him he trace down Leon and plans on destroying him with the girl. The climax of the movie is really amazing and makes you hold your breath. The director has done a perfect job and the movie had a good hold on the viewers from the very beginning. The 2 hour movie never seem to go off the track and the plot goes more and more interesting a you move on. It's really a must to watch movie.",Léon - The Professional
859,guy_avery,In the top 5 of all films I've seen,10,21 March 2018,"It's hard to find fault with this film. I still think it's the finest performance to date of all 3 main actors, possibly with the exception of Gary Oldman's recent performance in the Darkest Hour. The story is simple yet compelling, the outcome is never clear until the end and the action is short, sharp and spectacular.The interaction between the hitman and the girl is really well done and feels natural. It provides the core interest of the film and although the age difference makes certain interactions a little uncomfortable, this also gives an edge to the relationship which makes the film so compelling.If you have ever considered how Portman has got to where she is now - watch this and you'll understand!",Léon - The Professional

861,johnkenny3,One of my ten favorites of all time...,9,27 June 2005,"It is rare when a director takes as much time to set moods as was taken with this phenomenal film. For one example, in a brief shower scene, our ""Cleaner"", Leon, without a single word, tells us of his terrible torment between what he does, and what he wishes he was not compelled to do. So much tension, so little time... I am not a member of the film-making community, and I don't have the ""professional"" verbiage to communicate my impression of this film, but if you LIVE for the unbearable (what I prefer to call) ""stretch-to-snap"", this is your film. The violence of wanton, mindless, remorseless murder contrasted with unbearable tenderness, compassion and empathy, all rolled into one roller-coaster ride of a film. There are a few moments when credulity must be suspended, i.e., just how DID Leon get into that SWAT uniform so bloody fast--, but WHO CARES?--the bulk of the film more than makes up for it. A must see for sure. Also, Gary Oldham at his absolute FINEST. So evil, you just want to punch his lights out!",Léon - The Professional
862,jonjrhodes,Leon Is my Favorite Film,10,10 October 2003,"Now when i hear that a film is an action I normally take the opinion that it will be rubbish and the script will have been forfiet for the action scenes such as in and Jean Claude Van Damne movie or Arnie movie (with exception of Terminator 1-2) which generally ruin the movie and make it tacky and too stereotyped for an action film. But when I saw Leon i was amazed by the dialogue between Jean and Natalie as it seemed so real and easy to relate to. Everything about the film is just magnificent and exciting, Everything about this character Leon is done to a tee. His shyness is lifelike and his attitude to life is also. Plus the action in the film though I normally dislike action I loved it and felt gripped to his every movement and word. Especially Where he is lying down with Gary Oldman Standing over him and he forces out the words ""This is from M.......matilda"" ""Sh*t"" So if you haven't seen this masterpeice then rent it out or but it on DVD I Gauruntee you will rate it highly.",Léon - The Professional

867,swiftymcveigh187,"Beautiful, moving film.",10,11 August 2004,"When I first saw this movie on TBS it captivated me. How could such an excellent assassin befriend a little wafe girl like Mathilda? And more so how could she love a heartless killer? In actually watching the full length International Uncut Version (Version Integrale) many times over, I feel that I've come to understand Leon's plight, and the love that he feels for the child that he takes in.Leon - The Professional is beautiful. The film, in its gritty, dark, back room kind of feel moves those who watch it. Its almost like seeing a baby born, as you will see both main characters (Mathilda and Leon) be almost reborn into the world with something that they've never experienced before: binding love. This sounds sappy, and frankly if I had read this I would think that it was a pitiful cliché. It's not. Take it for what it is--a beautiful, moving film.

868,solidsnake55,Fantastic,10,28 January 2005,"Leon would have to be one of my favourite characters in film. His intelligence, skill and fitness makes him one of the best hit men in New York, but lives in a misery and is never truly happy. He harms no one but the people he is paid to assassinate and lives by rules to keep his profile low from people who may want to kill him.Director Luc Besson puts everything in perfection to make this movie great. The actors are great, especially Gary Oldman, which I think is his best Bad guy role ever. The use of music is superb and camera angles and the story is fantastic which makes this movie on of the most emotionally intense movies I have ever seen.***** A Fantastic Movie *****",Léon - The Professional
869,mattfraiser,Excellent,6,4 August 2017,"I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).So, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship, that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clichés, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional, is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over.",Léon - The Professional

When I see Leon I love him.i think jean reno should have been nominated for a best actor nomination. Gary Oldman is fantastic.Then there is Gary Oldman as Stansfield with one of the most memorable and iconic negative role ever played.i knew the little girl was Nataile Portman..Wow, its really a fine acting from the actress.For me is this movie the real #1 of the top 250!Léon is the best movie character I have ever seen,",Léon - The Professional
871,foul,"Perfect, the chemistry is spellbinding.",10,22 February 2004,"This movie has it all and should keep all watchers no matter their preference entertained for the full duration.In my mind, this movie works so well because of the exploration of the relationship between Leon and Matilda, the fact that Leon is a very cool hitman really becomes inconsequential after the first 20 minutes or so of play time. This is one of the few movies I will happily sit and watch the credits roll as the perfect choice of Sting for a closing song gives you perfect time to soak it all in.If you want to see this movie at its best, get the superbit DVD, its spot on. The audio on the DD track is surprisingly the preferred option over DTS in this particular case.",Léon - The Professional
872,cooper1-318-937211,Hardcore Action!,10,19 March 2012,"This movie has it all going on, an engaging story, explosive action scenes,expert acting, and Natalie Portman! She was the heart of this movie, at 14 she acted out a role that needed expert knowledge in the human way of thinking and feeling, and she had that covered. I'm not going to summarize the story, somebody else did, what I want to concentrate at is the fact the this movie had enough heart to rival a romantic story, and enough action to make it mistaken for a shoot'em-up movie. OK I'm going to say this just once, Watch the movie. You're not going to regret it. I would say the only part I didn't like was the ending, but I'm just that kinda guy I guess.

However it is immensely satisfying and has three outstanding performances. Portman's career in my opinion has yet to produce a role so intriguing, Oldman comes across as chillingly both insane and rational, and Jean Reno plays his role spectacularly, capturing both the human and inhuman sides to the character. Although at times I needed to pause and digest it, it was undoubtedly a superb movie. Gritty and unafraid to make bold artistic choices.",Léon - The Professional

I got nervous with the ""sexual tension"" in the USA version, so I dunno about seeing the French version--but I'm pretty prudish so ignore me.BUT about the plant. Great allegory, bad choice of plant. I'm a biologist (and I guess a perfectionist too) so when I saw her put the plant in the ground, I immediately thought to myself:""That plant is never gonna make it.""It was in the shade of an oak tree and it looked like a tropical-origin house plant that can't survive a freezing winter.

876,stephwereley,recommended,10,22 June 2004,"I'd always heard good things about this film and finally saw it for myself. I loved it. Although I didn't like the violent bits, I recommend seeing it. There are even a few light-hearted scenes to provide commit relief. And Natalie Portman is great in it. By the end I found myself emotionally attached to the characters- particularly Leon, the killer with a soft spot. And Gary Oldman has that whole psycho-killer thing going on that he does so well- he's so much fun to watch on screen. Now I want to see the director's cut, which contains twenty minutes of extra footage. It has a few extras that they didn't want North American audiences to see.",Léon - The Professional
877,Scotty_Ranking,Professional-ly done!,9,1 April 2005,"Wow! This was one of the first non-classic movies hat just blew me away!!!!!! Back in '94 when it was released, it was a welcome change from the 'senseless violence' flicks that Hollywood started to churn out in droves. The movie featured a compelling plot, well-cast actors and some very riveting performances.The basic root of this story - a killer with a soft heart - was probably the best executed example of its kind. Jean Reno nailed his portrayal as Leon; a professional hit-man whose relationship (not sexual, mind you) with a young girl forces him to re-examine his inner youth/lost child that his harsh life had robbed him of all those years ago..Gary Oldman was a little over-the-top drama king as the dirty cop villain, but I don't think anyone could have done it better, especially when his character took actions under the influence of drugs.I believe this was Natalie Portman's theatrical debut, and boy was she convincing! I don't think there are that many young actresses who can vividly portray the emotions and suffering that here character had to go through given the story that played out.The cinematography was superb, the effects well done (not overdone), and I'd recommend this movie for almost anyone to see, regardless of preferences!!!!!",Léon - The Professional

881,viervijftig,unrealistic and shallow story,6,19 December 2006,"I'm sorry for all the Leon fans, but this is truly the most overrated movie I've ever seen.. I will show you why..First of all, Leon is a personage which is as shallow as his own plant! All he does is kill people and act like he's alone in the world. And than, this girl comes in his life which changes his way of thinking: hmm... not all people are bad.. Which brings me to my second statement: The story is unbelievably predictable.. An assassin who is totally isolated from the rest of the world is almost forced to live with a child that was not loved, even though it is the sweetest girl in the world. They learn to know each other and he starts to like her. In the end, they are in an inevitable miserable situation, saves her. He dies (killing everybody, including dozens of innocent cops) and passes the assassin-torch. And this movie is in the IMDb top 250??!! The story has as much depth as a Lethal Weapon movie...And the script... Unrealistic. If you were the cops, and there are a killer AND an INNOCENT LITTLE GIRL in a room of a flat. What do you do? Let's blow up the entire room people! Great idea!!

I've since noticed a father/daughter motif in Luc Besson's films, probably most notably in Leon II: Wasabe.It's about how the austere and stoic male archetype can be floored by a small and powerless child. It shows a cold-blooded killer finding his heart, finding it more desirable than the killing and hiding. Now that I think of it, even the 5th Element follows this to some extent. I'm a huge Luc Besson fan in large part due to this recurring theme. You hope your favorite band never changes genres and keep going back to their music because they stuck with their style. Besson is that band.",Léon - The Professional

I have seen this move the first time on the TV in 1996 and it was one of the few that I could remember the story for more than a week and some of the scenes. The story about a very independent young girl that wants to become a professional killer was amazing. But what surprised me was the subtext that was a little hard to find out. As I picture the story of the little girl I think that her wish was never to become a professional killer she just tried to find her mission in life and she was overwhelm with the picture of a beautiful life with the next door assassin.

885,kramfamily,Last time I've seen this movie I was 9 years old,10,10 February 2014,"And WOW! When I was a kid I've probably seen this movie at least 10 times, if not more. For the longest time I didn't feel like watching this movie because I felt like I've already seen it too many times. But God Damn! I loved it when I was 9, and since then I've read plenty of books, and experienced too much of what life can offer. All that made this movie beyond incredible for me to describe in the true richness of emotions I felt. First of all, I do think it's better than Nabokov's Lolita. And I am Russian, so trust me, it means a lot for me to say that. Lolita was incredible for the first half, but this movie kept at it the whole time. Have I mentioned it made me ball my eyes out too? Definitely a better love story than Lolita.Then, there is Natalie Portman. For all these years I couldn't figure out why I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. Eight years later after watching this movie I've met a girl that looked exactly like her (Yes I'll clear this up, you creeps, she was the same age as me, 17). And I had no clue how a person could captivate me so much and for all these years after taking just one look at her. Now, after watching this movie at the age of 25, I understand where that came from. And yes it did make it a little awkward to watch a young Natalie Portman and remember those feelings. Did make it easier to feel for Leon though. To that I add, absolutely perfect writing, screenplay, acting and cinematography. Even if you've seen this movie before, do remember that it's been 20 years since it came out. Do yourself a favor and watch it again.",Léon - The Professional

Everything about this film was done to perfection, the direction, the acting, it was all done with such passion! Jean Reno is as always phenomenal, yet again he slips seamlessly into character so well you can't attach any other role to him, and the emotion he conveys is so real it really plays on the heart strings. Nathalie Portman is superb, better than a lot of actors twice her age and the chemistry between the two makes it feel more like a real life than a film. This film has faced a lot of opposition in the past for its supposed paedophillic undertones, and to that i say b*ll***s, watch the film, you will understand in ways that i fail to find the words to convey how beautiful the relationship between Leon and Mathilda really is. Luc Besson has a way of bringing me to tears, it happened in Big Blue and it happened in this.I cannot help but give this 10/10, it has jumped straight to the top of my favourite films list, and will be a hard one to shift, if you are thinking of passing this by i urge you to reconsider, you will regret it! stay tuned for my next trip into the world of Besson Le Dernier Combat",Léon - The Professional
887,dcunning,A remarkable humanistic story,10,8 July 2005,"I simply cannot express in words how amazing this movie is. Besides, hundreds of other people have already chronicled its nearly unparalleled appeal. Instead I have the following observations: I must say that when I first saw the U.S. release, ""The Professional"", on the big screen in 1994 I was not as adamant about its allure. I felt it was an intelligent action movie (which is generally an oxymoron, especially for Hollywood) with an excellent cast and a good story, but lacked the character development necessary to make it truly great. However, the more recent DVD release of the international version, ""Leon"", has glued together the holes and turned a great action film into a veritable masterpiece. The humanistic elements of this story, especially the interaction between the two protagonists (Portman and Reno) leaves the viewer no choice but to feel sympathy and compassion for their plight. This is quite uncommon in film.I cannot believe it got no Academy attention whatsoever (actually it's not so hard to believe with all the politics that go into the choices). I will say that 1994 was an excellent year for film...a year in which the Academy Award winner ""Forrest Gump"" was probably the fourth best film behind this one, ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and ""Pulp Fiction"".Anyway, take my word for it. You must see this movie. It is violent but the violence is simply the hard shell around the fruit that's inside. Crack it open and have a look. You won't be disappointed!",Léon - The Professional

The 20 extra minutes contain some of the most memorable scenes in the movie. I truly believe these scenes are integral to the development of the characters.

I loved this movie from when it originally came out, but recently found and watched a Director's cut with deleted scenes - they should have cut nothing! I agree with all that this really should have had a sequel - it would have been so easy to create a franchise from this small gem (better than so many other franchises that are bad after the original). I also recently read the criticism by the industry of the sexism and/or exploitation...COMPLETELY unfounded! I do my best not to spoil in reviews, but watch the movie for yourself - this is one of the best movies of love and innocence without crossing any lines.

Their polar opposites are the core of this movie, with Mathilda playing the role of a sub-12 year old trying to be an adult against Leon's failed attempts to be normal whilst discovering the childhood he never had.Gary Oldman's performance is critical in this film, and on first viewing can be interpreted as being over the top. On subsequent viewings it is clear that his perceived ""overacting"" is his interpretation of the drug's hyper-affect on his character.The interplay and character development that grows between Mathilda and Leon is the story line.

The story feels real, and draws you in throughout. The ending to this movie is probably one of, if not, my favourite movie endings of all time, with the amazing shootout and the emotional climax to the story. Some people may feel uncomfortable towards certain scenes, but to me that is the point of those scenes, to paint Leon in a light where he doesn't see Mathilda in the way she sees him: He sees her as a thing he must protect.Overall, well worth the watch if you haven't seen it already",Léon - The Professional

903,DarthGazak,"Absorbing, emotional, Intense, exciting and tragic.",10,20 April 2006,"Interpreted as an action film, Leon includes some of the most exciting and memorable shootout scenes in cinema. Leon, the professional, becomes the epitome of 'cool' by his use of guns and fighting techniques, all realistically portrayed in some frantic shootots. However, Leon is not simply some dumb action flick, but rather an exploration of character relationships, police corruption and, ultimately, doomed love.Jean Reno plays Leon, a withdrawn and silent hit-man, drawn into the depths of police corruption, brutality and evil by the helpless Matilda, played by a young Natalie Portman. Gary Oldman plays the ruthless and corrupted cop Norman Stansfield, who slaughters Matilda's family, and becomes narcotically obsessed with finding Leon. All three main characters excel in their roles, especially Gary Oldman, who portrays the evil and corrupt lawman as well as anyone ever has in cinema history. Jean Reno massively improves over his great cameo appearance in 'Nikita', and Natalie Portman sets her own stage for a future career.

Jean Reno is also wonderful, as the relationship of his character, Leon and Portman's character, Mathilda takes center stage. The story line and writing are great, but the acting and multi-layered dialog between Reno and Portman are what elevate the movie. The hit-man missions and big explosions are executed with excellence, but only serve as a backdrop for this movie, which at its core is a character/ relationship development piece. Mathilda, the oh-so mature and hardened 12 year old needs Leon as a role model, just as Leon needs Mathilda to essentially learn how to live life. The relationship there is truly complex, fascinating, and believable thanks to superb acting and dialog that does a exceptional job of facilitating the relationship.

Every single element comes together to create an astounding crescendo of action and drama - the oscar-worthy acting by Reno and Portman, the intelligent script, the stunning cinematography, the beautiful soundtrack, the authentic effects, everything. It's just a true masterclass in film, and, to be honest, I can't imagine it would have turned out half as good if there wasn't a French director like Besson at the helm.
As Gary Oldman said, ""It has the qualities of a big, hard-punching, fast-moving American movie and yet it has an injection of European cinema which I think gives it a very unique look.""It'll be a while before I can get this one out of my head.
Bravo Besson!",Léon - The Professional

Usually one lacks in words of description and praise. Therefore, only few words about 'Leon.' I've seen it for the second time recently, so I didn't have to pay all my attention to perfectly constructed plot and I could enjoy tasting many other things. Mainly the music. It pervaded me, I almost got high. Gorgeous. I can't find any words to describe it. Viva Eris Serra!

The performances by the entire cast are as amazing, as is the script. After watching it butchered by cuts and commercials on TV, we finally purchased a copy of our own. One of the wisest buys ever! Until then, we thought the title simply was ""The Professional."" Knowing Leon is the first part of the title is most satisfying. The character (and Reneau's performance) makes the name a requirement, which often is seen as the only title. Natalie Portman has gone on to make many other films, but this could still be her best effort. I'm sorry for anyone who has not seen this film.",Léon - The Professional

Natalie Portman is outstanding and you could never tell that this is her film debut.  Jean Reno's character is well written and Reno plays him very well.  Gary Oldman is one of the best when it comes to villians and is in his best here.  The attachment that you make to the relationship of Mathilda and Leon is so overwhelming, and throughout the movie your hope for Leon to turn away from crime grows so strong that you might not want to see the end.  I must say that the United States version alone is a great movie, however, Leon Integral Version puts it to shame and doesn't look back.  The plot is better, the characters are more complete and the ending is a lot more touching.  If you can, see Leon at any cost.  You'll be glad that you did.",Léon - The Professional

925,gers-3,A Sweet Masterpiece,10,3 November 2002,"The cast under brilliant direction and a subtly haunting soundtrack make this movie a masterpiece. Casting Portman and Reno together, young and hasty with patient and calm. They are opposites that complete each other. Oldman as the fiend is excellent, it seems playing the demented villan is his forte`.The soundtrack which is very European and sets a sad and melencholly tune that some how hints the whole movie that things appeare to be to good to be true.All the characters are conflicts. Non seem to be how they appear anitially. The cold and calculating assassin turns out to have a heart. The cocky self assured little girl finds out she needs love to survive.
This movie is one of the heart and the human condition. Beson shows how people in any extra-ordinary circumstance still need love, company and meaning.Beson is excellent in the way he makes things seem not as they look.

930,jon.jenkins-2,I long to see the version integral,10,3 June 2000,"Growing up in England, European cinema was an intriguing alternative to the home-grown fare and the imported (mainly US) staple.  I'm not quite sure when I became a convert to the European narrative, but Luc Besson was an integral part.  My infatuation with Nikita has waned, (but please don't watch Point of No Return as an alternative (though Bridget Fonda will remain a favourite), or Nikita dubbed) we are not discussing alternatives.Luc Besson's relationship with Jean Reno is essential, from the early role as the drummer in Subway, to Reno's position as the ultimate European hitman.Leon provides Jean Reno ample space to prove himself the icy hardman, but it is his relationship with the then 12 year old Natalie Portman, Matilda, that provides him the opportunity to express the paternal side to his ice-cool hitman that completes his charactarisation.The often taunted ""Version Integral"", only currently available on R2 Japanese import, adds a further 20 minutes to the development of Matilda's relationship with Leon, and I for one can't wait for my chance to see it.This is for me currently the best action film available.",Léon - The Professional
931,Max Brill,Luc Besson's best work!,9,31 May 2000,For me this film is Luc Besson's greatest piece of work that he has done. It makes me notice something new every time I watch it and always makes me upset at the end. I feel the best scene in the film is when Matilda has come back from the shops with Leon's milk and is pleading for Leon to open the door. When the door opens and that rush of light hits Matilda's face...well its just great. The acting is excellent even if Gary Oldman is a bit over the top but this does nothing but enhance the film.

933,aajami59719,The greatest battle of emotions,10,29 October 2000,"Leon. It is one the best ever made movies in the entire 90's. Luc Beson shows an unbelievable dance of life in this film. The start scene is breath taking. After 5 minutes you don't believe what you've seen. Then, everything starts, Matilda smokes and Leon talks to him. The perfect match of music and acting makes Leon as a perfect movie to show the truth using different languages. Erric Sera composed a magical eastern style music, depicting the emotions by melodies. Natalie Portman and Jean Reno play a perfect couple. In one scene Matilda tells to Leon that: ""I'm in Love with you"" . It is the sweetest definition of love between the two, or the scene that Leone asks Matilda to not smoke and don't curse.This movie is definitely a masterpiece. No one ever had this amount of courage to show how life is beautiful and how it is bitter, how great is the love, how easy we will die, and at the end there is only a memory of everything.If you didn't see this film, Go and get it.

It's an intense yet reserved movie, like Léon himself.  The casting is superb.  I am buying a DVD player next month so I can see the version integrale with the deleted scenes and without world's worst pan-n-scan.The movie's treatment of the Mathilda character is difficult for some. Her relationship with Léon is, of course, the beautiful, painful, redemptive heart of the film.  How odd, that we're used to seeing pubescent girls kill in movies, but seeing one experience an intense attachment is disturbing to us.",Léon - The Professional

He was a hit-man who obviously has no family and love for no one and he finally finds someone he can care for. It is not really sure how he loves her, but he wouldn't have sex with Matilda. He loves her like a Father would love his Daughter. This is one of the few well made emotional aspect movies that I can actually enjoy. It had everything a movie should have, slight humor, emotion, drama and action and most importantly, love. If you can't respect a well made film like this, then perhaps you shouldn't be on IMDb, trying to offer your two-cents on a movie you know nothing of.",Léon - The Professional

The Reno-Portman team it's one of the best adult-child couple I've seen in years, and Gary Oldman is just great as Norman Stansfield, the crazy DEA agent (the moment when he takes his pildores, is just unforgettable).

The film is based in France and the main caracters are Natalie Portman, Jean Reno. Natalie Portman plays the little girl Mathilda and Jean Reno plays Leon a serial killer.Mathilda is a 12 year-old little girl living in New York with her family scattered. For Mathilda who doesn't love her family, her most valuable asset is her little brother. When her father gets involved in drogs, he kills are all members of the mafia family. Meanwhile, Mathilda who was at the grocery store, narrowly escaped and hid in the apartment where Leon stayed. Leon is a very cold- blooded killer. But he has a sincere love for Mathilda and protects him.Like many people, I found the film very sucessful. It can give sadness and happiness together.

But later on one last mission which he would finally retire turns out to be a hit on Matilda ""natalie portman"" who is older now and is actually a setup to get both of them because what they both didn't know was that their story was only the beginning.

I watched this movie for million time and know the lines and scenes from memory. Yet never get tired of watching it over and over.",Léon - The Professional
957,orkydoc,One of the very best!,9,26 May 2001,"""See, Nothing can stop love, Leon.""A friend of mine asked me a very serious question the other day. It was ""We already have the Professional out on DVD, Why do we need a longer version of it?"" I just smiled and said ""Because the world is full of precious treasures left on the cutting room floor."" Ah, who am I kidding. I actually just slapped him upside the head for being such a moron. The film isn't only twenty-three minutes longer, it is twenty-three minutes better! ""Leon the Professional"" takes ""The Professional"" in a whole different direction. You still have the basic film which is one of the best action/adventure movies on the Earth and you add a doomed relationship which makes it one of the best action/dramas on the Earth.The story behind the missing twenty-three minutes is a short one. The studio which recut the film felt that the scenes involving the burgeoning relationship between Mathilda and Leon might be a tad racy for these shores. I think most people agree that they sold this audience short.True, it does discuss a taboo relationship which breaks laws, both legally and morally. But this relationship is key to the story. There never is any sight of a sexual relationship between the two, but there is the fact that Mathilda loves Leon and she wants to go the distance to prove it to him. You also have to take into account, that these are two outcasts from society. Leon is a manchild, skilled in the ways of war but not in the ways of life. Mathilda is a womanchild skilled in the ways of life, but not in war. Their situation demands that they both teach each other the tricks neccesary to survive.The missing footage also reveals some things about Leon which were unfortunate enough to be surrounded by the inappropriate scenes. This version tells more of his history. We also get to see more of his relationship with Tony (Danny Aiello.) They also reveal some of the innocence required in the dichotomy that is Leon.I know that I'm getting too deep here, but that happens with a film like this. You see it the first time and marvel at it's poignant characters and involving story. You think about it the second time and realize that you have some of the details wrong. The third time you watch it, you see that the characters are not what you felt them to be originally, and you fall in love with the movie all over again.Leon is a ""cleaner"" who fled to America in his younger years. He has honed his craft into being the best at his business. He runs odd jobs from time to time for Tony, who is the local head of the Italian branch of the hitmen. Tony has a good deal in Leon. He gets a skilled killer with no necessities in life. Tony doles out the money and Leon lives his simple life as he was raised. Mathilda is a young girl, spirited and headstrong. She gets thrown out of her school early in the film and Leon finds her smoking a cigarette on the steps. They share the briefest of conversations and Leon goes back to his apartment. Her father is a drug runner who has been cutting cocaine for the local hoods. His habit of cutting it too thin and making some money on the back-end ticks off those same mob men, Led by Stansfield (Gary Oldman) who coincidentally is a D.E.A. agent for the New York City police.
Stansfield comes and wipes out Mathildas family as she is running an errand for Leon. She comes home and sees the carnage and knocks on his door, praying for him to let her in. He does and she vows revenge. She also has nowhere to go and ends up staying with this quiet, gentle man. Upon learning what he does for a living, she asks him to train her. Leon agrees and the two become a team to take out the scum of the city.Mathilda however is confused about her relationship with Leon. She feels that she is falling in love with him, and he resists. Not because he knows it is wrong for a man to fall in love with such a young girl, but rather because he feels he can never love again. The two travel from apartment to apartment as they outrun the police and a rival gang. They grow closer as Mathilda finally becomes the aggressor in the relationship, and we watch as she changes from a gangly girl in love to a mature girl who knows her place in life. The relationship however, is doomed from the start as both have caused situations to grow until the point where it can only end in tragedy.The cast is superb. Jean Reno, with his droopy eyes and gangly physique becomes a man to be respected through his deeds and not his looks. His code of ""No Women, No Children"" is a strong motto which shows his character is although confused, still strong. Natalie Portman is well cast as Mathilda. Her innocence fades quickly and she becomes a central character in the film through her own decision skills. It was a strong part for a little girl at the time and she played it well. Gary Oldman plays Stansfield. His zoned out drug induced rages show what he is capable of. It's also interesting to see that his small part was extended into a larger one based on his skills.The disc is superbly done. Digitally remastered audio and video combined with an anamorphic presentation give this film the visual respect it deserves. Luc Besson, the director is a master at odd camera angles which enlarge the suspense. This version makes them even more enjoyable!The disc also includes: Widescreen presentation Production notes 5.1 English and 2.0 Dolby surround soundtrack Isolated music score in Dolby 2.0 channel surround International ad campaign Theatrical trailers Talent files Interactive menus English, French, Spanish and Portugese trailers 28 Chapter stopsBottom Line: A fantastic film made even better!

Besson has now become one of my favorites..in fact, one of the few I actually follow. Natalie Portman blew me away with her incredible talent at such a young age.

959,blinskiboy,How is the top 250?,6,4 September 2007,"Let me start of by saying this movie is not bad!Leon is very entertaining and original. Has some dull spots, but amazingly well written and well acted out characters. This is a GOOD movie. I stress the word GOOD. It is not GREAT. I could understand and relate to someone who found it GREAT. But in now way what so ever is this a top 250 ever and BY GOD IT IS NOT A TOP 50!!! There must be something I was missing. I watched a really cool action film that was better than the rest due to its intricately woven characters and its original storyline. That does not mean its better than DIE HARD and YES it falls in the exact same genre and YES I just compared the two. Overall cool cool cool flick, definitely watch to entertain yourself, but CMON TOP 50? Please this just goes to show the rediculousness of IMDb ratings nowadays... and just so everyone knows I am not bashing this movie it is just sorely overrated on here so I had to voice myself. As my Comcast Cable Company rated it so wisely 2/4 stars! OUCH! sry fans but its the truth! Hey I think its better than 5/10 stars though!... but nothing over a 7 please.",Léon - The Professional
960,chris_haralambous2,A must see for everyone!,10,26 June 2001,"This film is without a doubt the definitive action-romance film. It is artistic in style and breath taking in appearance. The acting is exceptional, Natalie Portman`s performance as a young woman scorned has earnt much deserved acclaim, and Jean Reno`s performance is so good its almost scary, its as if he was made for that character. Gary Oldman plays the part of the bad guy as always, and his acting quality made me detest the character by the end of the film, its a rare feat for a film spectator to have hatred towards a film character, but i`m sure if you watch the film you will feel the same way too!

Jean Reno (Leon) is the man for the film his innocence portrays well on the screen and is acting ability is boosted by Gary Oldman (Stansfield) , Danny Aiello (Tony) & Peter Appel (Malky) A great plot and story line to the film giving a different insight to organised crime only which has been emphasised in recent years The word ""Cleaner"" has a whole new meaning not just picking up a mop!!! The Young Natalie Portman (Mathilda) brilliant shows her acting ability at a very young age. I have watched the film over and over again and each time I never get bored This is a Luc Besson masterpiece I have put this film in my top 5 of all time it just shows that when you get the correct combination of actors, script and director you do not need a massive budget to make a very memorable film.

The acting, sets, dialogue twists, everything - I wouldn't have changed one single thing about this film.Natalie Portman gives her best (and eerily, most mature) performance ever - it was her first, too.  Go figure.  Jean Reno is outstanding, as is Gary Oldman.The middle portion of the movie has some slow spots - which is probably why U.S. studios cut so much out of the US release, I'm sure.  This movie is NOT the Lolita story some reviewers tried to make it into; the US release contained some bad edits that may have misled them.

The film is quite dragged, the story is unbelievable, I don't think the director could decide if it was an action film, a drama or a fairy tale, so it's all genre jumble. How this can stand at such a high point, it remains a mystery to me. Overall, more emotional people may like this better, but I'm not so stupid as to take emotional pounds with assassins. All that's good about it is that it started Natalie Portman's career, but she has better films like Black swan, Star Wars, Thor. Jean Reno also has much better films like The visitors 1-2 (french films which aren't very known in the US) or Shut up (also a french comedy).

I was at a late night theater with some friends and we decided to see something different.The relationship that Leon allows to develop between himself and Mathilda is beyond compare. The summaries that I have seen state that he teaches her to be a contract killer. While he does give her lessons, this is not the real meaning or reason for the movie.

Few films that i have seen have been able to give me a lasting and more importantly affectionate impression. points at which i was moved was when Leon said that Stansfields killing was 'from Matilda' and at the end of the film with Matilda planting Leons plant, amongst the sounds of the fitting 'Shape of my Heart' by Sting. The relationship is a surprise, a homeless 12-year-old with a disillusioned hit-man? improbable but obviously not impossible when within the scope of the creators of 'Leon'.Overall, i would strongly recommend this to anyone, regardless of taste as it's appeal stretches over many genres from action to crime, and from romance to drama. It is in my opinion, a modern classic deserving a view from anyone into movies.",Léon - The Professional
979,reira-60032,French charm and bloody deaths - perfect mix,9,6 October 2021,"The movie Leon is truly one of the best things I have ever watched. A legendary Luc Besson's picture. Even thought it was released in 1994 it is still as topical and urgent as at the first screening in cinema. An incredible criminal thriller about a mastership of the murder, unexpected accidental meeting and an amazing pure love between two opposites.How can a professional killer fall in love with a little girl, whose family was killed? Well, Leon, an expert killer, whose life is nothing more but completing one 'order' after another one, played by an unsurpassed Jean Reno, didn't expect this to happen as well. His routine was monotonous when Natalie Portman in a role of a 12 years old Mathilda appeared in his doorway. And this acquaintance changed his priorities and life.The best part of the movie is its atmosphere and aesthetic of The Little Italy in New York, mafia and dirty cops, muted colors and Sting's song during the titles, which is still inimitable to these days. Moreover, the French charm and criminal cruel scenes are looking surprisingly good together. There are many details in this movie that made people who didn't even watch the scene like it. One of the main one of them is Mathilda's outfit with red beanie, khaki jacket, black round glasses, which became an inspiration for many members of teenage subcultures.What has to be also mentioned, people love to watch films based on easy basic concepts. The whole movie is a game of contrasts and incompatibilities. A grown man and a little girl, a killer and a blameless child, guns and kids, murders and a friendship, immortal love and death. This whole movie is a confrontation of black and white. That is also its secret of an unfading success.Summing up, I can't think of anything bad about this movie or things I don't like, so I am just going to say that this movie is amazing and everybody who hasn't watched it yet should do this and those who has already seen it can rewatch it again because it is worth it.",Léon - The Professional

It's a mobster movie crossed with a coming-of-age story, but it is more than the sum of those parts.Leon: The Professional has been criticized for being violent and overly cynical. But those qualities are part of what makes it great. Movies that do not take violence seriously are worse than shallow-they are dishonest. And a movie that does not take human nature seriously is worse than shallow-it is meaningless.Leon: The Professional does not have an overt message about human nature, but its characters and situations speak volumes.

986,crogs_brown,An action and drama rolled into one,9,27 May 2007,"after being very impressed by Luc Bessons french film Nikita there was no way I couldn't watch this film, so I did. Amazimgly this film was slightly better than Nikita. The plot is an Italian hit-man Leon lets an abused young girl into his Apartment as she has no where else to go, Leons life becomes very different after her arrival.The movie perfectly blends larger than life action and very emotional drama together. The movie is helped largely by some great acting performances by all the characters in particular Gary Oldman (who seems to have no end to the roles he can play)as a slightly crazy crooked cop, Natalie Portman and Jean Reno work together brilliantly some of the scenes were Portman says very awkward things are pretty hard to watch as they are so realistic you can imagine yourself in Reno's position, he doesn't really know how to reply but the acting he does with his facial expressions alone are brilliant and tell the story.I honestly think this gem stands proudly alongside such films as scarface and pulp fiction (your probably laughing right now) this film would have been fairly ordinary had it not been for the dark humour present.I have heard that the longer version of this film builds the characters a lot more and is better. I have only seen the version which apparently has around 20 minutes or more cut out I am going to try my hardest to find the other version it truly would be a masterpiece if it's better than this.",Léon - The Professional
987,kodiacbear,Look for the international version,10,7 June 2007,"The US version of the film is heavily edited, which correspondingly causes the plot to break and makes some scenes seem senseless. I was not a big fan of the US version (it was basically an action film), but really enjoyed the international version. The international version explores the relation between Leon and Natalie Portman.I believe the reason for the censorship is that many Americans consider any sort of a relation between an older man and a younger girl as pedophilia. This is not the case, and, it is a sad reflection on American culture that this is what viewers would see. In a similar vein, Disney refuses to release ""Only Yesterday"" as it contains a few references to the dreaded M word. Hello, aren't we over being Victorians?",Léon - The Professional
988,the_pro,The #1 movie of all time.A perfect 10.,10,27 January 2002,"This movie is my favorite and I've seen quite a few. I give it a perfect 10. And if you want the complete experience be sure to watch the uncut international version(version integrale)(133min), which is 26 minutes longer than the original US release(107min).It's a must-see for every film-lover out there. It's basically a love story spiced with action and drama, where the twelve year old girl Mathilda and the middle-aged hitman Leon are the main characters. I think the acting here is remarkable.The cast is perfectly put together and I think Luc Besson made a genious move by letting Natalie Portman play Mathilda(it makes up for casting Anne Parillaud in La Femme Nikita..and more).Noone can ever top Natalie and Jean Reno's performances in this movie. The chemistry between them is awesome. To top it off the film has the greatest music score I've ever heard, thanks to Eric Serra....and the two songs from Bjørk and Sting are amazing. It's all beautiful. If you still don't know if you want to see it, I can tell you my taste in movies so you can compare.

989,ConkerBFD91,"""I like these calm little moments before the storm...""",9,18 February 2008,"Many movies have characters in them who are hired assassins, or ""hit men"". They're the standard ""badass"" character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold, heartless villains (Boba Fett of Star Wars, Vincent of Collateral). Léon, however, flips this cliché on its end, as the hit-man is the kind-hearted protagonist who learns how to love, thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.Léon begins in a restaurant, with the assassin himself (Jean Reno) taking a contract from his boss Tony (Danny Aiello) to kill a man who's moving in on Tony's territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner: he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon's human side, shown by his passion for milk, his affection for his plant (whom he calls his best friend) and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin' in the Rain. Leon seems quite content with this life, not seeming to want anything more. That is, until he is forced to take custody of a twelve-year-old girl (Natalie Portman) whose entire family was cruelly massacred by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). This is where Leon is forced to change his lifestyle for the little girl, and when she wishes to get into contract killing to avenge her brother, Leon becomes her mentor and protector.Luc Besson was both the director and screenwriter for Léon, and he proves with his sophomore effort that he is no one-hit wonder. Léon is a very fast paced movie, chronicling Leon's training of Mathilda, Mathilda's growing affection for contract killing (and for Leon himself), and the final standoff with Norman Stansfield. Despite all this, Léon also has time to throw in some slower scenes that develop Leon's and Mathilda's characters, expanding on their growing relationship and partnership.Jean Reno does a very good job as Leon, portraying him both as an effective and frightening killing machine, and as a loving and caring father figure. There is almost a childlike innocence to Leon, with him being unable to read and not familiar with most American culture. Reno allows the audience to both sympathize with this character and respect him, an extremely challenging feat.Natalie Portman's breakout role as Mathilda is one of the greatest acted child roles in a film, period. Portman is able to portray childlike innocence combined with an above average intelligence and awareness of the world around her. Although she is young, she becomes extremely interested in Leon and his job, wanting revenge for the gross acts committed upon her. Make no mistake, Mathilda is the true star of this film, and Portman completely shines in the role.In comparison to Jean Reno's fairly subdued performance as Leon, apparently Luc Besson wanted a more exciting and over-the-top antagonist for the film: enter Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman completely overacts his character of the crooked DEA cop, and he does it so wonderfully that he steals every scene he is in. This is without a doubt the greatest performance of this underrated actor's career, as the fun Oldman has with this role practically oozes out of the screen and infects anyone who watches him. While some critics criticized Oldman for his performance, it was actually spot on considering that the character of Stansfield is a drug-addicted psychotic cop who has no problem with murdering an innocent family to get what he desires. The only nitpick I have with Stansfield is his screen time is fairly small compared with Leon and Mathilda; nevertheless he completely steals the show when he does appear.The plot of Léon is fairly straightforward compared to most action flicks, as there are no particular plot twists or double crossings. However, the simple plot works because this is not a plot driven movie, it is a character driven one. That's not to say there is no action in this movie, there are a few great action sequences (especially the spectacular police shootout in the film's climax), but the film mainly revolves around the growing affection between Leon and Mathilda, and how they change each others' lives. Overall, Léon is an extremely well-made action/drama, and one of the best films of 1994.",Léon - The Professional

998,adamlep,Not just a film- a work of art,10,2 July 2003,"Luc Besson has captured the true art of film making in Leon. Not just in the direction of the film but the writing of it.""Leon"" tells the tale of a hitman working and living in New York City. Leon, the title character (played by Jean Reno), isn't just a hitman, he is the best hitman in the city. He has nothing to live for really, he just works. His life changes when he is given the responsibility of taking care of a young girl, Mathilda (played by a young Natalie Portman), after her family is killed by a psychotic DEA officer named Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman.) Mathilda immediately catches the attention of Leon after she thinks it's ""cool"" to be a hitman or ""cleaner."" She ask him to teach her the art of ""cleaning"" so she can have her revenge on the killer of her family.
The performance of Natalie Portman is the best in the movie considering she plays a 12 year-old girl in a strange situation. Jean Reno is also quite good as the quiet hitman but Gary Oldman was amazing! Always a bad guy, Oldman's twisted and scary performance blew me away.Some are bothered by the strange relationship between Leon and Mathilda but that is what you need to focus on to understand the film fully. Maybe for today's world it ""pushed the envelope"" a little (For example, in one scene, Leon and Mathilda share a bed.)

The next time I saw the movie was at home on TIVO, in December 2001 and I fell in love with the film all over again.Firstly, the theme of the movie - Isolation and Redemption - The characters Leon and Mathilda had no one who loved them in this world and were very much alone (mathilda did have her 4 year old brother but that was all she had)The characters were dealing with a similar lonlieness even thought heir worlds were very different.Secondly, the scripting in the film really hit me. When a bloodied, beaten Mathilda turns to Leon after meeting him only once or twice, she says to him ""Is life always this hard or just when your a kid?"" Leon pauses and his response to her was not what anyone would expect. The whole movie is well scripted and blows me away.Thirdly, The cinematography is top notch. When Mathilda arrives at Leons door and she pleads to enter and when the door opens bathing her in light is simply breathtaking. The close-ups on the characters and the way the camera is held over their shoulder as they talk with each other really gives it a personal feel to allow you to empathise with the characters. I could go on about the cinematography more but I have more.Fourth, the music by Eric Serra. I really enjoyed the music more and more with each viewing as I came to realize that the soundtrack was orchestrated specifically after each scene was filmed and then the music was designed to match what was happening on screen. Sometimes, I watch the movie and just pay close attention to the details in the music. It creates a whole new perspective.Fifth, the acting and the casting. Jean Reno plays Leon so perfectly. You really can sense what the character is about. The soft spoken hitman who is like a child in many ways but extremely skilled at his job. Natalie Portman plays the street wise Mathilda who has to pull off one hell of a performance. Many say it is her best role and I agree. Much of the acting by both of these characters is done with simple facial expression. The dialogue between these two leaves you wanting to see more. Danny Aiello as Tony. Gotta love Tony. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Its open to debate and thats the way it is intended. Gary Oldman as Stansfield - The bad cop - what can you say? he plays the role over the top and is perfect and nuts.Sixth, Luc Besson, director, writer and visionary who saw the potential of this film and went for it. How could anyone expect a movie that has a hitman who protects a twelve year old girl who falls in love with him and wants to be trained as an assassin to be a great film? Luc and Co. realized the dre am and brought the right people on board to make this very special film. I am amazed that it even came to be. He rested 50% of the acting chores on a 12 yr. old girl with no acting lessons or experience - his film depended on her and he was a little worried, no doubt. But he showed her what he needed from her and she gave everything she had... and it shows.All I can say is this movie is like a song that I never grow tired off. I know there are others who fell the same way. Feel free to email me and join the Leon fan club on yahoo. 10 out of 10, of course.",Léon - The Professional
1001,American_Beauty,"A story of love, action, and one mans rediscovery of life.",10,10 July 2002,"The second best movie in the world. A must see. This movie tells the tale of one man, torn between the life he leads, and the opportunity of having a daughter/companion that is Matilda. Natalie Portman gives one of her best performances and Jean Reno gives the best acting job I've seen from him. He really plays the character well",Léon - The Professional
1002,animefanyo,like this because it's different then other hitman movies,10,1 September 2002,"Léon is a very good movie I think. It's shows a different style of a hitman. Even if he not goes a round in suit, and his not just ice cold, he is a effective hitman. He is a perfect smart hitman and every one that haven't seen this movie yet, they should really do it!",Léon - The Professional
1003,mazer-rackham,Terrible,1,11 May 2008,"Highly overrated. I didn't believe it for a second. In the opening scene, Leon peeks through a bullet hole in a door into a dark room with light behind him, and in doing so shows the gunman on the other side exactly where he is. Another time, when a hit goes bad in an apartment building, Leon only steps over from the door a foot or two as the man inside seeks to spray the entire wall with machine gun fire. Leon's character is completely unbelievable, he is never shown to have any degree of intelligence, not by the storyline or the acting, yet the other characters strongly push this notion. When I think of a character who is intelligent and good at killing, I think of Hannibal Lecter played by Anthony Hopkins. Leon is abysmal in comparison. Not only does the linear plot have no shred of plausibility, it is also made up of predictable scenes and dialog, which only infuriate the viewer as they drone on. Every scene feels forced, so unrealistic you can almost feel the presence of the film crew in the room, complete with the director frantically trying to think what should happen next. The unwarranted dramatic music is clearly a futile attempt to cover the bad acting. Nobody reacts to anything properly. The villains are cartoon-like at best. The only thing shocking is the amount of cursing in a story which was so clearly written for a children's TV show. The first few pages of comments almost had me convinced I was crazy, until I found the realistic ones buried at the bottom.",Léon - The Professional
1004,echall29,French movies going Hollywood,10,27 July 2016,"I saw this when i was young and started to see how french movies are going Hollywood style with action scenes, car crashes and packed with shooting scenes. After this movie, we started to see more French actions movies like Taxi; where they perfected more the police chases and actions scenes. The stunts also became as good as Hollywood stuns; when we think that film started in France last century then Hollywood picked up the torch; it is nice to see the French catching up in few movies. I wish i can find more French movies like Nikita which also went mainstream, in the USA where i live now; as an actor, i compare both continent and am proud sometimes to see old and new movies that goes internationally famous.",Léon - The Professional
1005,mstation1,Thanks for the memories!,10,2 October 2002,"I watched Léon again this week, first time in about 5 years, and remembered how this unique movie allowed me to meet Natalie Portman.  She is a wonderful person who happens to be a very intelligent and beautiful young lady who can act.  Thanks for allowing me to meet you during the run of Diary Of Anne Frank. Gary Oldman is a wonderful actor who is sometimes overlooked in the commercial aspect of actors. His role in Léon truly shows the depth of his acting.  Be sure to check out the film True Romance, another great movie, which Oldman's character has a short run, but displays his great ability for taking on any role and giving it his all.  Overall this movie is one of Luc's best with a similar taste from Point Of No Return. Thanks to all the writers, directors, producers and cast for giving us such great entertainment.

1008,gigabyte89,"Manolo, one glass of milk for my friend, Léon. .. OK, Make that Two.",10,2 December 2008,"This movie is a piece of Art. Truly unique in its genre. It successfully blends action, drama, thriller (...you name it) together. It’s masterfully directed by Luc Besson which proves that you don’t need a big budget to make a really good movie. The shooting is awesome- Camera angles, close to face camera focus, scenes such as Mathilda’s face illuminating as the door opens and the white flash at the end is simply awesome! The Musical score and soundtrack such as Sting and Björk is again... Very well chosen and fits the movie completely! The movie contains some unforgettable dialogues & scenes too. The scene where there is a burst of laughter in the Restaurant or the toilet scene with Gary Oldman is just a treat to watch that guy act! From its explosive start to its brilliant ending, no any segments gets boring at any time, everything is relevant and you just want more!The acting by the magical Trio Jean Reno-Nathalie Portman-Gary Oldman just smokes! ‘Nuff said. Probably one of the best I’ve ever seen in a movie. You could read everything just on their facial expressions and looks real. It’s really amazing…About the controversial pedophile issue I think you guys are pushing this a little too far. The Bed scenes etc, it is not sex but platonic love as Besson said! It’s that “love in the air” that makes the movie even more gripping.Timeless classic and among just the handful of movies you could watch indefinitely… No questions. I’m always happy. This is a straight 10. This is my favorite movie.",Léon - The Professional
1009,fadetoblack0889,State-of-the Art movie,10,16 December 2008,"Absolutely loved every bit of it. A true classic surprisingly underrated and overlooked in history. It is in full swing every way you look at it, it’s flawless. I call it perfection. The pinnacle of Luc Besson film-making career. Direction was superb as well as the soundtracks and scores (by Eric Serra). The scores was one of the pivotal element of the movie which add to the depth and dense atmosphere to the movie. Besides the movie is highly stylish and original. All these finishes off with one of the greatest, breath taking ending to a movie I’ve ever seen and that without using excessive special effects.The movie carefully drew the picture of the characters in the opening 25 min. In the art of killing, Léon is a Pro. But in real life, he is a loner. Like DeNiro in Taxi Driver. His best friend is his plant. Deep down, he is a child. He is mentally slow and do not know how to read nor write. Then there is Mathilda, a 12 years old girl who lives in a dysfunctional family, on the verge of committing suicide. She has endured the hardships of life that had made her mature at her young age. Her entire family was wiped out by a corrupt DEA Officer and his men because of drug problems. She had no other place to turn to except his next door neighbor, Léon.Then the tone of the movie changes completely which breaks the stereotypes of other action movies. This is where the movie caught me by surprise. I thought it will become just another boring movie and how wrong was I! Prepare yourself for awesomeness! This is something I never experienced before in any other movie. It was that exceptional. The way it’s constructed & layered or in short put together was a work of genius. Arty like. There was this fascination and perfect chemistry between the two characters. It looked so freaking real and deep that you are taken away in the skin of the characters.The cast & acting was perfect: Luc Besson wrote the script with Jean Reno as Léon in mind and no one else. The role was crafted for him and he delivers the goods. He played on his facial expressions more than words actually throughout the movie. He portrayed the character as exactly Luc wished it to be. This is his breakthrough and famous movie.Nathalie Portman was so versatile in her role as Mathilda. She pulled up into a complex and difficult role. She was wonderful and prolific considering her age (12). She shifted between different moods seamlessly (An uncontrollable burst of laughter in the Restaurant scene and a burst of tears in the ending moments of the movie). She is lovable, cute, touching and has a lovely innocent voice. Still her best acting to date.Then there is Gary Oldman as Stansfield with one of the most memorable and iconic negative role ever played. You will love to hate him. I won’t hesitate to say that he was on par with the great Heath Ledger’s Joker. His lines were a killer. He’s acting was scary and funny at the same time. He's a freak. He is definitely amazing. Danny Aiello role as Tony was excellent in a minor role.Verdict: 10/10.Perfect. Memorable. Repeated viewings recommended & watch the uncut edition to enjoy the true potential of the movie. It still holds as my favorite movie after 14 years of existence. Never gets old. Glad to see it is gaining its due respect with time and still climbing the ladder in IMDb Top 250 ;)",Léon - The Professional

I find the best movies invoke more than just the obvious thoughts from the viewers.  On the surface, one might see this as a typical good guy/bad guy flick, with a little love tossed in. But I see this movie with many different views, and more are revealed with each viewing.  I probably connect with this movie so much because I can relate to Leon's growth...that is, he originally is shown as a cold blooded assasin, but you realize later the he is still that 19 year old young man before he killed his first person.  Only the world and his body have aged and changed.  He desperately wants to ""live"" again, and it took the unconditioinal love from someone to make that happen.

Even worse, she never felt cared for or looked after and thus felt a strong sense of duty to look after her younger brother who was barely living his life as a toddler before his untimely death. Leon, the savior, is a strong figure in her life. Despite a vengeful undertone he sets her on the straight and narrow otherwise. He teaches her to defend herself, care for plants, to be independent. She was robbed of her childhood and becomes quite precocious. I am relieved the film did not portray leon as anything more than a plutonic protector.

1026,HannahMickleburgh,Admirable film.,8,18 August 2013,"Léon, to put it simply, is a masterpiece. One of the greatest early-modern films, no doubt about it. Natalie Portman at 12 is already excellent, and given a chance so few have: while there are many younger actors a mere handful can win these starring roles, and in serious films they're too young to see. Comparable to Kick-Ass, though this original suspense flies past the modern indie-wannabe in daylight. Nothing was stilted nor pushed too far and the story, yet unmentioned, is simply insightful. The only reason I give an 8, not 9 or even 10, is because 8 is my favourite number, and so only given to those which are worthy. The actors own their roles, and should play these characters more often. (This is) A favourite that will (unexpectedly?) last a long time.",Léon - The Professional
1027,Vany16,Like a fine aged wine,10,12 February 2016,"I just watched this awesome piece of cinematography, starring 11 year old Natalie Portman (in her debut role), Jean Reno and Gary Oldman. Directed and written by Luc Gasson, also known for The 5th Element, Taken 2, among others. I must say I am a little late to the parade but like a fine wine I was able to digest this wonderful display of art, which with the passing of age has acquired a more profound and exquisite experience than any other movie I have seen in recent times. It all starts with us meeting Leon (Jean Reno), the stealthy and magnificent hit-man which never fails to deliver. He's not your typical 007 agent, you know the type, the one with the cool factor, driving the latest sports car, all the super spy gadgetry stuff at his mercy and with a Victoria's Secret model dangling from his arm. He represents the complete opposite; very reserved, low-key guy and without the slightest need or interest in human relationships (at least that's what we glean from the surface, but our leading man is much more interesting than we could imagine). Then we meet Mathilda (Natalie Portman), which I give an standing ovation, it's incredible the amount of maturity and complexity she accomplished to portray being only 11 years old at the time and this being her first movie, some actresses have years in the business and have never reached that level, talk about natural talent. 12 year old Mathilda has endured a lot of misfortunes which forced her to mature at such a young age, and robbed her of the innocent child phase. The worst of it all is when she losses the only thing that she held dear to her heart, her little brother, along with the rest of her family but the latter she sees is it as more of a relieve than anything else. When these two souls encounter each other, Leon and Mathilda, both with nothing to lose and at the same time with a convoluted sense of self and life, they flourish and find something worth fighting for, each other. It's too simplistic to label it as a revenge story, it goes much deeper than that. It portrays what human beings are able to endure and sacrifice if they find something worth living or for that matter dying for.

Danny Aleio is convincing in his caring for Leon. The action sequences are very realistic and not gratuitous.

1032,hanvladut,Masterpiece,10,24 March 2015,"Leon (Jean Reno) is a tortured soul. He lives in squalor and misery, never truly happy or at peace with himself. After all, he is a hit- man. He lives quietly from kill to kill, harming no-one whom he has not been paid to assassinate. He is a simplistic, childlike man who lives by his own set of morals but is troubled by them. The one thing he seems to fear above all else is change.Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is Leon's neighbor. A young girl, she lives with her father, step-mother, half-sister and half-brother. As unhappy as Leon, she lives in awe of the dark stranger, unaware of his true profession. Beaten by her parents and sister, she has abandoned school and instead spends the day watching cartoons and trying to escape from the real world.When Mathilda's family is brutally murdered by a drug crazed Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman), her only chance for survival is to hide with her neighbor. When she learns of Leon's true identity, she becomes infatuated with both him, and the grim world he inhabits.This stark portrayal of humanity and inhumanity is produced with the style and finesse that one expects from Luc Besson. In addition, the combined talents of Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman provide not only an unmatched on-screen chemistry, but also three perfectly created characterizations, the like of which are rarely seen in today's cinema. This film has my personal recommendation of being the best piece of cinema that I know of. I have not seen anything that matches it in terms of intensity or emotion - and believe me, I've looked. I found myself caring for the characters involved, an unique experience in itself. This is not the type of film for a night in with your mates, but nevertheless, it is an unforgettable piece of cinematic history",Léon - The Professional
1033,ecostar,An incredible film,10,10 November 2003,"Jean Reno, Gary Oldman, and Natalie Portman in her first film, turn in sterling performances in a movie about death rebirth and love.Some may find the love relationship between Leon and Mathilda unnerving but this is not the crux of the story.  The story is not just about about Mathilda's sexual awakening.  She awakens into a loving relationship that is more than sexual.  Her previous father figure was abusive.  Leon rescues her from that existence and they both show each other what unconditional love realy means.It is also about Leon's emotional awaking through Mathilda.  Scarred from his first love relationship he has created a monochrome world where nothing exists but death.  Mathilda is his first taste of real life.  Mathilda awakens in him a longing for somehting more than his current existence.Ultimately this film is about hope.  Early in the movie Mathilda asks Leon ""is it always this bad . . .""  In a somewhat cynical response he says yes. If you were to ask his character the same question at the  end of the movie he would probably say ""No, even if only for a fleeting moment.""Give this movie a look if nothing more than for the fine measured performances of several fine actors and an early look at an amazing your actress.",Léon - The Professional
1034,Mystery-fan,One of the best films of all time,10,13 August 2013,"This movie is one of my top 5 favorites of all time. Lot of reasons for it. It combines a great and interesting storyline, coupled with stellar acting performances.Oldman really puts the punch into the villainous role, he is terrific, but Portman steals away the show from everyone. It could be one of the top performances in a female role, and that too by a young girl. The novelty of the story is it's handling of the relationship between and elder man and young girl in an entirely different manner. The chemistry between Reno and Portman is amazing.Overall, the movie is great from the start to the end, including the climax.",Léon - The Professional
1035,seannippert-1,Leon A.K.A The Professional. this movie is one of 10 best of my lifetime.,10,18 December 2003,"I personally think that it (the uncut international version) Leon (A.K.A. The Professional) has to be one of the 10 best movies of my time ever released in my lifetime.  I have a couple of friend that barely speak a lick of English and they loved it.  You don't have to even hear the word of the movie to get the gist of the drama that happens with this movie.  Gary Oldman is the parallelism of every corrupt evil genius bad guy and plays the bad guy role so well that I bet he gets hate mail in real life, when He played Dr Smith in Lost in Space, there was nobody that could have done it better.  Jean Reno was great as the Italian Hit man (assassins have a political (even if paid) agenda behind their killings and have no morals about killing woman and children, which Leon does, so I don't think that is the proper euphuisms to describe his profession. In the cut version you never hear of the crippling by lost love in the past and the reason he finds new life in the commitment to care for the orphan and to live again but must compete with his past and present dilemmas.  As for Natalie Portman she is pure genius and has the credentials to prove it.  (at the time of the filming, she spoke 3 or more languages fluently, I don't remember exactly) as well as many other things I find amazing to her credit.  Natalie plays the part with zeal and awe as any teen might but still showing an unbelievable amount of professionalisms considering her age.  Her recent movies are even more of a testament of her excellence in acting.",Léon - The Professional
1036,eurydicedup,Superb.,10,22 August 2004,"I have to say, after watching ""Léon"" countless times in the past, it never ceases to amaze me. There is a certain simplistic beauty in the shots, in the characters, and in the story. Léon, the title character, is a 'cleaner' who lives modestly in his apartment on the same floor as Mathilda (a young and endearing Natalie Portman), a pre-teen with a bad family life. When the slightly-unhinged, corrupt law enforcer Norman Stansfield (perfectly played by Gary Oldman) shows up and murders Mathilda's family, she has no choice but to seek help with her neighbor.And from there the story takes off; a bond slowly grows between Mathilda and Léon, and it all winds down to a heart-wrenching final scene. I just love this movie. Bravo, Luc Besson.(note: I suggest you watch ""Léon"" rather than the edited ""The Professional."" The former goes into much more detail in the relationship of the two main characters, and reveals more about their time together.)",Léon - The Professional

The story of 'cleaner', hit man, Léon and how he ends up looking after his young neighbor, Mathilda, and teaching her his trade as she seeks revenge on her family's murderer, the crooked DEA agent Norman Stansfield.Natalie Portman does an excellent job as 12-year-old Mathilda, bringing both emotion and believability to the character. Jean Reno is brilliant as he almost always is and Gary Oldman takes evil to a new level as the drug-crazed Norman Stansfield.The music suits the film well and makes the memorable story really come to life.

If I had to recommend this film to someone I would say, ""you have to see it especially for the character Stansfield."" It's one of those performances that keeps me inspired in my own career as an actor. Aside from my own personal admiration for Gary Oldman, the film is full of moments any film lover can appreciate.

At first, you can easily see it as a violent movie, some scenes are brutal and bloody, mainly at the end of the movie . Anyway, I don't think it is what you will remember after seeing this movie, it is more than just an action movie. These scenes are well-filmed and you can easily forget the bloody part and you will focus mainly on the relation between Mathilda and Léon and also the development of those two characters.

Even though you might not think it during the film, you are actually siding with one of the bad guys, since Leon isn't exactly an angel! But this makes the story even more spicy. What is also a bit strange about the story is the fact that the so called ""love"" story occurs between an adult man and a twelve year old girl. It is ironic that at the end, the pro ends up dying and Mathilda's life returns to how it would have been if nothing had ever happened, as in going to the school for troubled girls. Ultimately Leon lives on in his plant his ""best friend, just like [him]"".

A long introduction - i am aware of .
Now , to emphasize that i found my recent watching of ""Leon"" decidedly captivating , and the overwhelming number of aspects of Besson's direction ( or in short 'his movie' ) extremely well done - and most 'enjoyable' , well , 'entertaining' would be much the better term - i have nevertheless the following reservation : From the moment that Mathilde comes home to find her family murdered , no, even before - when she's sent out for an errant - you absolutely know the plot , all to the finish , with her returning to her school benches with the school mistress admonishing her not to fiddle with life's truths ....
It's all very well 'presented' cinematographically , but then 'we' are 'here' ever so spoiled by equally 'fantastic' detective series by BBC , ITV , and all & sundry European productions , many of them way past the usual Hollywood Mega-Money Crap . And then ,,, well , while i gladly admit that there is plenty of very professional good , even excellent acting throughout ""Leon"" , in particular the child Natalie Portman , and some of the supporting actors like the 'gorilla' coming to Leon's door , and of course our 'villain's' over-the-top performance make for good entertainment , but all said , the story's characters couldn't be more cliché if one tried : the casting of Leon is exactly to his role as Forrest Gump , and if you were looking for a 'nevertheless-sympathetic' Italian Crook , well , there you got 'im , nice acting , nicely presented , just what you would expect !!!
This is where , for me , the film fails . i do watch better actors five times a week , often better cast , and certainly in much better stories , mostly detectives like ""Wallander"" ( the Swedish production ) or ""Montalbano"" and more ...

Two worlds collide, two beliefs clash, two lifestyles merge, and the result is LEON. What can I say? This is by far my favorite film and I'm not afraid to say so. Directed by Luc Besson, LEON has touched on so many thematic elements that are subtly concealed under the fascinating hollywood-like fighting sequence. From LEON, the viewer sees Luc's terrifying portrait of Devil incarnated in human flesh, of elegant mastermanship embodied in a contract killer with the mind of a child, of desperate innocence endowed in an ""overgrown"" child, of Love, of Family, of Care, and above all, of Sexuality. Can't say too much about the film or I'll spoil it, but I have a few words of advice. While watching it, please pay attention to every little detail that Luc Besson has enstaged for your satisfaction, as every little scene performs a specific, no matter how small, task. Secondly, please do not, and I beg with the greatest sincerity, limit your imagination. Let it run free and wild! And leave room for debates, for discussions, for back talks, as this film in no way ends with every question answered. The point is proven, but its shadow hovers on, encircling everyone who has watched and received an impact from it. I got mine, and even now, every moment I think about LEON, I feel a violent rumble running through my nerves, a painful revelation, a blissful remembrance. Hail to Luc Besson, this is no doubt one of his best films, and one of the precious gems out there that did not get tampered with even with all the actions that Luc has projected.",Léon - The Professional

I have seen the movie of one thousand times and i never get tired of it. truly a masterpiece! The mobsters the Italian hitmen the crooked cops, the run down city it's all great. My favorite scene is when the cops first come to the apartment and Mathilda gives them the wrong code of knocking and Leon is already prepared with his gun ready for them to walk in. Also, when he puts the gun to the one guy's head and makes him follow them into the apartment and just before they get there he shoots the sprinkler and they think he shot the guy and they take out their own man.

(""The Shawshank Redemption"" comes to mind as being such a movie.)  For each time I watch this movie, I seem to aquire a deeper attatchment to the story, and become more involed in the personal stuggle's of the two main characters; Jean Reno as the ""professional hitman"", and Natalie Portman as ""the little girl"".As one reviewer so accuratly put it, ""A man with nothing to lose, and a girl who has lost everything.""  From there, comes a true masterpiece of a film. Natalie Portman gave a brilliant performance as the little girl, and IMO, was cheated out of an Oscar nomination.  For she really ""shined"" in such a demanding role, and at even such a young age.From the surface, the movie might seem like it would be a typical ""hitman, violent movie"".  But it is FAR from it.  From the beginning, to it's thought-provoking end, it will leave you wanting more.  And after you see it, you will understand why it made the ""Top 250 movie list"" of all time,(currently #64), being voted-in by the ones who REALLY count, ""ordinary people"".This movie has been be added to my small, and very selective, DVD collection...as I believe it is a worthy addition to any DVD collection.",Léon - The Professional

I wondered whether the bra & panties may have been left in the ""furnished"" apartment by a previous tenant. Then I arched another eyebrow when Mathilda appeared with a ""Marilyn"" white halter dress, that just happened to be the perfect size for a 12-year-old girl?One might speculate that she retrieved clothes from her old apartment, but that seems implausible. Consider this: Shortly after Mathilda moved in with Leon, the pair moved to another apartment. The charades scene precedes the scene where Mathilda visits her old apartment. Are we to believe that Mathilda was able to access a guarded apartment twice after they moved?Just thought I'd pose the question- I'm no continuity expert, and I've been willing to suspend belief the other 200 times I've watched this excellent film.",Léon - The Professional

It steps past that with a great cast ensemble, strong personalities, and dramatic emotions. Gary Oldman ties up the cast perfectly!

First of all, I didn't expect such a common story to be cinematographed in such an extraordinary way...The whole idea of a professional assassin who like another caged lion tries to get away is old in cinematography. However, it is composed with passion for freedom.I give credits for that to Luc Besson(writer and director) and Thierry Arbogast (director of photography).Every scene could be a short movie by itself and that is another characteristic of the movie's power. Acting is exceptional: Gary Oldman of course steals the show from everyone(as he does in every movie he has played). Natalie Portman is the definition of the term actress. As for Jean Reno I believe that no other actor could give better the picture of an ""assassin under obligation"". The movie is dressed with the most emotional and breathtaking music i've ever heard for an action film. Probably this is why ""Leon"" is a movie that cannot be categorized in only one film category...It's like a Love Story wrapped in Action inside a Drama. I cannot put it next to any other movie because it combines various ways of film-making. Luc Besson used close portraits for intriguing, took advantage of the light in such a degree that in the end it became one more excellent actor of the film and kept the colors restrained in order for the atmosphere to be ""killing"".",Léon - The Professional

I am absolutely sure this movie would have received much more attention from the critics and festivals if it was made by an American director.

1065,seijitsusa,Collecting Contracts,9,24 January 2005,"Leon, aka The Professional, is one of the best hit-man movies ever made. Collecting contracts never looked this cool but, there is much more to the story in Luc Besson's masterpiece.Leon (Jean Reno) is the best in the business. Cold, ruthless, with the ability to take out a 'client' before they even know they are in danger. In and out without a trace. With an unassuming look and somewhat gawky presentation to the outside world, no one would ever know that the person walking passed them on the sidewalk is carrying enough firepower to take out a small army in his briefcase. His life is simple, his surroundings are simple, his expectations are simple. The only items in his life he cannot leave behind are his love for milk and his plant.Matilda (Natalie Portman) is a 12 year old girl. Troubled by her family situation and wondering if life ever gets easier. Her father beats her, her mother could care less, and her sister takes closely after her mother. The only person that means anything to her is her brother, a 5 year old little boy who turns to Matilda when things get a little rough at home. This is the way things are, the way they have been all along. Things are about to change.When Matilda's entire family gets murdered by a ruthless FBI agent (Gary Oldman), Matilda turns to Leon for help. Unwillingly, Leon takes the girl in and soon the girl is exposed to what this quiet man down the hall does for a living, collecting contracts. Matilda immediately wants to learn the business and take revenge for her murdered brother. (Taking a .38 and firing out the window of Leon's apartment to make her point.) Leon, again unwillingly, begins to teach the girl how the business works and the rules that professionals must follow. No women, no kids.This is a truly amazing story that takes you on a journey of mixed emotions.

The little girl has only one desire to revenge for the little brother who was killed by people of Stensfild. Living with Leon she understands that has fallen in love to him. Mathilda, a twelve-year old New York girl, is living an undesirable life among her half-family. Her father stores drugs for two-faced cop Norman Stansfield. Only her little brother keeps Mathilda from breaking apart. One day, Stansfield and his team take cruel revenge on her father for stretching the drugs a little, thus killing the whole family. Only Mathilda, who was out shopping, survives by finding shelter in Leons apartment in the moment of highest need. Soon, she finds out about the strange neighborers unusual profession — killing — and desperately seeks his help in taking revenge for her little brother. Leon, who is completely unexperienced in fatherly tasks, and in friendships, does his best to keep Mathilda out of trouble — unsuccessfully. Now, the conflict between a killer, who slowly discovers his abilities to live, to feel, to love and a corrupt police officer, who does anything in his might to get rid of an eye witness, arises to unmeasurable proportions — all for the sake of a little twelve-year old girl, who has nearly nothing to lose.",Léon - The Professional

Even as a kid, you can tell that Natalie Portman is destined for great things. I feel like even though Gary Oldman's character is a bit over the top, he still makes him as believable as possible. But, the stand out is obviously Jean Reno. Amazing as ever. Just a perfect roll for him. I must have seen this film at least 20 times, and every time I catch some little nuance that I missed in the past or just see something differently than I had before. It is just a great, if not underrated movie, and not only worth a viewing, but many. You surely will not be disappointed, and if you somehow are, give it another chance to grow on you.

There were good fight/gun scenes in the beginning and the end, but there isn't really a good fight scene near the middle; that would really show Leon's hit-man skills further.There were only those short scenes of Leon and Matilida knocking on doors and those two scenes with the drug dealer and the other one with the crazed mad gunman.Excellent film by the way :)One more fight would be good!",Léon - The Professional

Nathalie Portman as 'Mathilda' was mesmerising and Jean Leno has yet to excel in subsequent films, I always see him as 'Leon' (sad, yeah?) Is the uncut version only on DVD or is there a US version that someone is keeping secret from me? If so, where can I get a copy? Also, is there a soundtrack available? only song I've heard is Sting's 'Shape of my Heart'. I loved the haunting violin sounds throughout the film. With regards to other comments on the the 'sexual' nature of Leon and Mathilda's relationship, I'd like to think it was innocent, pure love and a lack of a decent father figure in her life, but I may change my mind when I see the uncut version!",Léon - The Professional
1071,rabe_rabe,Leon the hard but soft heart killer. It's a masterpiece!,9,4 February 2005,"Luc Besson is a super talented producer: he succeeded in engaging his audience either with a VERY positive or a SUPER negative responses. He could make us see compassion in a merciless hit-man (Leon) and at the same time, he could engage rage on account of a roaming free ruthless criminal and a no-age boundary romance. He led his viewers see that a deviant behavior CAN be a product of society's injustice. Loss of response to death and killing other people can be a survival mode of a deeply hidden broken heart. Aileen, the woman serial killer, didn't she also experience serious injustice? Both Mathilda and Leon experienced mistreatment and emotional destruction that led both of them in some way behave the way they do. The beating that Mathilda suffered and her very unloving family background made her heart even bitter and become emotionless to death at her early age. She became too mature for her age. Luc Besson combined reality with myth. Part of the romance in the story is possible, but in some way, the super rapidity of the hit-man can be doubted. The sexual awakening behavior of a pre-adolescent girl is very much a reality. Her attraction to an older man that can portray her missed normal relationship with her own abusive father is a reality. As for Leon, he has an emotional level of a 19 year old who was badly struck by his first love morbid experience despite the fact that he is much much older. He lost the capacity to love and respond to love as if his own heart is dead some twenty years ago. Leon portrays a dead heart person that could not feel any pity any longer to taking other's lives as a result of his incapability to face lost love. He chose death and killing as his sole purpose for life. Both Leon and Mathilda's love awake in this movie. The movie looks at the emotional dynamism rather than the morals of the hypocritical society. Luc Besson denounces the societal structure that often is at the root of society's illnesses. Gary Oldman, Mathilda's parents and Leon's former girlfriend's dad were the ones to blame. Leon and Mathilda are the victims. This is a great movie because it made its point whatever where you stand. The meaning is deeper and commends reflection and serious analysis. The fatal end is sad but triumphant since Leon ""lived"" again. He could love and forget his gloomy past, and especially, he made the unloved little girl, Mathilda emotionally happy and economically secure. At least, Mathilda is ready for life, she has been loved. How pitiful for those who have never been loved. Yes, Leon, what a ""Killer""!Luc Besson, congratulations!",Léon - The Professional
1072,rubberchamp1987,Luc Besson shows his teeth...and his heart,9,23 October 2013,"From the very first moment we are introduced to this modern version of ""beauty and the beast"" the director Luc Besson is insuring us that we are not going to see another typical Hollywood action movie. In 1994 the world was blessed with great movies such as Forrest Gump, Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption and The Lion King. After seeing Leon, I have no doubt that it belongs among these memorable pictures, because of the story telling and acting. The character of Leon, our hero, is well played by Jean Reno almost superhuman. Focused on the getting the job done with a control of feelings. But only on the job...You might have seen him in other Besson movies where he plays other ""professionals"", but only in Leon, Reno shows us that even cool hearted professionals has a soft spot, and he does it well.Natalie is amazing in this movie as the ""Lady in distress"" Matilda. You actually wonder where that acting talent went, when she was in Star Wars(but enough of that). You can't help to fall a little bit in love with Matilda and the way she tries to soften up this rough character that Leon is. Have heard the discussion that Gary over plays his character. I couldn't disagree more. He is diabolical to perfection and it makes him easy to hate. Furthermore his almost sick fascination of Mozart, makes me think of ""A Clockwork Orange"" like he says to Matildas father ""I used to like him(Beethoven) too"". Feeling like you want a bit of the old ultra-violence perhaps?I can only recommend this movie to every one who loves, gangster movies, quirky love stories and the movies of Luc Besson. You are in for threat with Jean and Natalies amazing synergy and the wonderful acting of Gary Oldman.

1074,jenny-fredrickson,Characterised by 1 performance,9,28 November 2013,"It's a good movie, without doubt, yet I cant help but feel that the cult following that IMDb has garnered is the cause for it having such a high rating. I mean it shouldn't be in the top 40 (or so) films of all time list.After watching Leon I felt rather hard done by, yes the review I've given is good and it's deserved but it can hardly be considered a masterpiece. To satisfy curiosity I suggest it's worth the watch, if only for another spellbinding turn by undoubtedly the greatest English actor of his generation. Not only has Gary Oldman set the benchmark for sociopathic villains, but his touch is so feather light that the eccentricities of each individual movement are as delightfully entrancing as they are wickedly sickening. Yes, admittedly my admiration for the man led me to write this review but only because I feel it important to tell others that this is one of his best performances to date and that it prevents this movie from being forgotten. I watched the film after seeing a 'Top Ten Gary Oldman Performances' video on the old youtube thingymajigg ('watchmojo' is a very interesting channel, go on... check it out.) and this has led me to scouring the internet for different films involving this guy, and honestly, and fairly upsettingly, I can't think of a better way I could've spent my time. In my, not too sought after opinion, he is the greatest actor I've ever seen and I repeatedly tell my friends ( and I know I don't sound like a guy who has any, but I'm fairly certain that they can be counted as friends ( don't ask them in case I'm wrong )) to study the man in great detail. I mean, they hadn't even heard of him. Anyway, in all honesty, this review was supposed to be serious but I fear I'm losing my way. So on we go... The performance of Reno is sturdy as is the support of the majority of the cast; obviously the use of a child acting doesn't fail to annoy, even though the girl in question went on to reach stardom (didn't see that coming). I'm not an expert in direction so I'm not in a place to comment on Besson's job, but he's created an enjoyable film that certainly breaches the norm, so top marks there. I don't know what to make of the French, this film points in their favour though. I think this conclusion gives me an excuse to compliment G.O. so I will. All I'll say is that if you have the intention/hope/dream of going into acting, or simply just admire this strand of entertainment: this guy's the man to watch. Sorry for going on, anyway I liked it... I suggest giving it a go.",Léon - The Professional

In the first 30 minutes you know how the movie its gonna end. But i enjoy it, its not the usual movie about a hit-man and i like that.

1077,relowther1,Not your average action movie.,7,13 July 2014,"""You've given me a taste for life"". This movie is about an empty man who becomes filled with passion. The awkward conversations and sleek action scenes provide a humorous and violent movie, teeming with character development. From the outset we realise that Leon is an excellent assassin, methodical and controlled. This seems like a recipe for an average action film, like so many before this one. Leon's skill is shown in the violent scenes of the film. He kills with such ease and sleek class that it makes one squirm with gratuitous pleasure, similar to the effect felt watching the likes of a good James Bond. Films of this nature, typically bursting with sex and glamorised violence, seldom touch as deeply on the isolation that fills these contract killers' time as 'Leon: The Professional"".The reason behind his proficiency for killing, and the ability to deal with the additional psychological weight, is due to his lack of humanity. In this sense, the film goes against the stream of conventional action movies about hit men. Leon sleeps sitting up, drinks only milk and his apartment lacks furniture. Even the bare apartment has more character than Leon, a man of few words with a seemingly emotionless and unsophisticated personality. Leon's zest for creativity and love for living is deficient. Even his language is sparse. These qualities are what we like to think makes us human, our creativity and language. This is made more evident when contrasting him to Gary Oldman's spectacular character. Leon has no personal gain or purpose for his killing, he has no need for the money he makes from it, but Oldman is driven by greed and desperation. Oldman provides a great performance as the 'bad guy'. His psychotic unpredictability and restless facial contortions are absolutely terrifying. His brief composure when listening to classical music provides a great juxtaposition to his unstable, violent and torturous persona. This eccentric performance probably influenced Dafoe's character of an unstable cop in 'The Boondock Saints'. Matilda brings light and excitement into Leon's life. She has an inspiring ability to surprise the audience with her maturity. Throughout the film I found myself questioning her real age due to her direct language and confidence, something that is a stark contrast to Leon's unassuming and frankly wooden persona. This is where the movie shines. Allowing yourself to temporarily forget her age and the limitations that boundary entails brings forth a powerful relationship between the two protagonists in which they both learn from each other. For Matilda she wants to be accepted and treated as an adult and for Leon, he wishes to feel alive again, even if he does not know it. Matilda's love cannot be taken lightly, as despite her age, she is more emotionally aware than Leon. Because they never kiss, their relationship is shrouded in uncertainty. Matilda's language is passionate and I look upon as genuine love. Whether it is romantic or not is up to you, however the knot in her stomach that disappears makes me personally lean towards the former. There are times when Leon is both a father figure and lover to Matilda, and the film works well by leaving the audience forever hanging in suspicion. Their relationship is no doubt powerful and the way both characters grow beside each other is blindingly obvious but romantic.The effect Matilda and Leon have on each other is astounding and powerful. Leon, the ultimate professional, begins making mistakes. He now has things worth living for and spending money on, and the humanity we have never seen in Leon increases. Matilda's confidence grows around Leon. Perhaps she feeds off his social ineptitude and quiet demeanour and uses his silence to fuel her words. Nevertheless, at the end we realise that the limitation of age is stronger than the lie she has been living. The whole fantasy brutally spirals back to reality. Without Leon she is still a young girl. Leon's quest for passion arcs in a full circle at the end of the film with him returning to his childhood. His first kill at 19 was for love, as was his last. Whether it romantic or paternal love, you decide.The film brings forth the poignant question: who decides who should fall in love? 'Leon: The Professional' echoes with themes similar to 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Lolita', should society define who can fall in love? Whether it age or social class, love is not a force to place boundaries on.",Léon - The Professional

Luc Besson perfectly managed to make us feel things through his movie. Natalie Portman is charming and her acting is great, as usual. Jean Reno succeeded at being at the same time a cold-hearted hit-man and an emotional sweetheart. Gary Oldman succeeded at being a villain. It is a smart action movie with a touch of love and comedy. A real thriller, leaving us speechless during all the movie, specially at the end. When the movie ended, I started asking myself questions about me and the world around me.

Not only does it contain thrilling action sequences, brilliantly directed, it also has great dramatical power and the three main performances of Leon, Mathilda and Stansfield are all superbly delivered, each one very special on its own. I also must praise the great cinematography and photography of this movie, which is a trademark of Besson's. Jean Reno certainly gives one of his best performances (excellent actor overall) as the deadly yet childish Leon, a character with a sensitivity so appealing it's impossible to dislike him, in spite of his office. Natalie Portman is just mind-blowing in her character Mathilda, a tortured child with incredible strength and hopefulness. Some have said that Gary Oldman is over the top in this, but I just find his character exhilarating, so unpredictable and creepy, you actually become afraid of him, which is very, very uncommon in most villains, specially recent ones,totally predictable and boring. I only wish action movies were made along these lines, with a simple, yet powerful story, and characters you actually care about and feel related to. Great Movie.",Léon - The Professional
1081,thefarfarside,A Superb Movie!,10,3 May 2005,"For a movie to get an 8/10 from me it has to be brilliant. For 9/10 it has to be exceptional. What more can I say about Leon which gets a resounding 10/10? It is without doubt one of my top 5 movies of all time. High praise indeed! Setting aside all the 'arty-fartyness' of the quality of the cinematography, the lighting, acting and directing etc, the fact is it's just a brilliant story. Luc Besson and his cast couldn't possibly have put it across any better hence the 10/10 from me. Yes it is quite a violent movie in parts, and 'shoot em up movies' with lots of blood and gore aren't my preferred genre on the whole. But the balance struck in this movie is perfect. Let's face it, you couldn't make a movie about a wet boy without showing some violence. But so many directors could have gone overboard with that side of things. Instead of which Monsieur Besson and his merry band of players stops well short of unnecessary violence. It's a love story without sex, a comedy without banana skins, a drama without over-dramatisation, and above all else it's a heart warming story of a shy and in many ways insecure man taking care of a young girl living in an abusive family environment. Thankfully not once does the viewer read anything into the relationship between the man and the young girl other than what is there, i.e. mutual respect and friendship. The outro music (""Shape Of My Heart"" by Sting) was not written for the movie specifically, but never fails to brings a lump to my throat each time I see Leon.

It is by how much it shows you moments, dialogs, situations that get into your mind and which you think over and over again after the movie, without necessarily finding a deep philosophical meaning in them. Moments that left you enough of an impression to force you review and analyze them thoroughly. This film gives me what I am looking for. Leon and Mathilda are excellent characters and you really embrace their personalities, their spirit, their hardships, you watch their actions with agony and feel their will for carrying on in a cruel,unforgiving world. Stansfield is also excellent as the villain and shows the other side of the coin, that is how easy it is to fall into immorality and how much power that can give you in the system we live today.

1083,yanggg,Just for copy,9,25 May 2014,"From Amazon.co.uk Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) made his American directorial debut with this stylised thriller about a French hit man (Jean Reno) who takes in an American girl (Natalie Portman) being pursued by a corrupt killer cop (Gary Oldman). Oldman is a little more unhinged than he should be, but there is something genuinely irresistible about the story line and the relationship between Reno and Portman. Rather than cave in to the cookie-cutter look and feel of American action pictures, Besson brings a bit of his glossy style from French hits La Femme Nikita and Subway to the production of The Professional, and the results are refreshing even if the bullets and explosions are awfully familiar.--Tom Keogh Product Description Léon: The Professional (French: Léon; Original U.S.: The Professional) is a 1994 English- language French thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson.

I'm missing out on some good quality entertainment on account of some uptight individuals. The scenes with Mathilda selling girl scout cookies to the future marks were actually quite hilarious. I also found the dinner scene well conceived. I do have a friend that has watched this version of the movie with me and well he didn't like it. The sexual undertones and all else that was involved. I guess i can see where that might bother people. But the point of the matter is that it is a great movie that is good in both versions. If Lolita style stories make you uncomfortable for any reason then don't watch this. By the way before i confuse anyone that has not seen the movie. The Professional is a much more innocent movie than Lolita.,Léon - The Professional

1097,KeenApperception,Wonderful character development!,9,5 February 2015,"This film manages to show so many complexities without needing a complex story. Leon is a ""cleaner"" from a foreign country who manages to transcend his lot in life with the help of a young girl. This story could have taken a very dark route with two unlikely friends, but it remains free of that drama. Mathilda, goodness what a breakout performance that truly set the bar of excellence for such a young actress. She blends comedy and drama seamlessly. Not to mention Portman's ability to say ""okay"" in so many different ways, it's endearing. It's an unconventional love story set in the backdrop of an action movie. An instant classic if there ever was one.",Léon - The Professional
1098,vivk427,an action film in its own class,9,11 December 2005,"There are many action movies that come out every year. Each one always strives to simultaneously be considered a film. To me a film has a deep storyline and many details that one must gather to put the story together. It is not very commonplace for action movies to be able to do that and The Professional, or Léon, has done this in a such a marvelous way. Many people will say that The Usual Suspects does the same. However The Usual Suspects is by no means an action genre. It is a thriller. The Professional is far more gruesome in its violence and also has more action. Gary Oldman gives probably his best performance next to his portrayal of Dracula. In this film he convinced me he is hands down the greatest portrayer of villains. I would not put Christopher Walken in his class. Though Walken is a great villain in his own right. I thoroughly enjoyed this film because it was smart, action packed, and it was not overdone.",Léon - The Professional
1099,lcaviles47,Fantastic Choice,10,12 March 2015,"I absolutely love the nonstop action. Interesting young lady in this movie but she played the part very well. The cast and crew did a fabulous job on the set. Actors made the movie literally feel like it jumped out at you. The suspense caused that reaction as well.There were many thing I learned from this movie which are actual events so it helped me understand some things a bit clearer.Have since recommended this movie to many to view and I usually do not recommend movies because the majority of the time their taste are completely different from my taste.So in closing I can only say, awesome movie, great actors I would definitely see it again.",Léon - The Professional

Luc Besson's film is undoubtedly among the most outstanding hit men films ever made with few noticeable flaws. Jon Reno's best on-screen appearance and first motion picture debut of Natalie Portman blend into one accurate drama involving crime and a true illustration of what can be clearly described as love. With an impressive balance between the action scenes filled with blood and affection and fondness the two main characters express towards each other, this film is yet dominated by a need of revenge and desire to protect altogether.",Léon - The Professional

From the very beginning I liked the captivating visuals, the exceptional score, the cool action, the heroic assassin, the maniacal villain and so on. But without Natalie Portman's breathtaking performance, none of that would really matter in the long run. It's the love between Leon and Mathilda that makes this movie unforgettable. I expect every grown-up with adequate mental capabilities and an open mind to perceive the purity and sincerity of this love.

1103,STARS_UNIT,One of the Best Films Ever,10,12 March 2006,"What can one say about the masterpiece that is Leon? From it's opening that takes grabs you and never lets go, to it's final scene...It's a challenge to look away from the screen even to blink.Perhaps the greatest thing about Leon is that you don't see the actors. You look on screen and you don't see Natalie Portman, Jean Reno or Gary Oldman. Instead you really feel as if you are a fly on the wall, watching Mathilda, Leon, and Stansfield as their lives unfold around you.Not only does Reno bring alive the role of Leon, he also manages to humanize him. He takes this hit-man character, and makes you realize that there is more to him. That behind the skill, there lie the heart of a simple man who hasn't lived any other way.Portman masterfully captures the essence of the tortured soul that is Mathilda, that you really have to admire Portman for her acting chops. This could not have been an easy role for any young starlet, and yet Portman captures it perfectly. The subtle nuances, the child like innocence, and even the dark side of Mathilda's soul are portrayed excellently.But perhaps the greatest pleasure, or at least the one I enjoyed the most, was the performance of Gary Oldman. The ticks, the glazed over appearance, the dazed and confused responses, as well as the ""over-the-top"" craziness of Stansfield is captured beautiful through Oldman's acting. Oldman makes Stansfield so interesting, that even when he's not on screen or the focal point of a scene, you can't help but wonder what he's doing.The entire movie runs together smoothly, showing that despite his hardened ways, Leon is still an innocent soul who is just doing what he does best. And we slowly see how the innocence of Mathilda slow reaches the heart of Leon, which hasn't been reached in a very long time.Overall, an excellent movie and a recommendation for both action and drama enthusiasts.",Léon - The Professional
1104,boulgakov,What else can I add to the reviews? The music is great!,10,25 June 2005,"First of all, I emphasize once again that the long version not released theatrically in the United States, known as Leon (as opposed to The Professional) is a much stronger film.Story with soul. Great chemistry between the leads. Characters you really care about. Style. Carefully crafted action. Artistic cinematography. Rhythmic editing.Luc Besson and his crew really hit the sweet spot with this movie. 10/10Anyways, most other reviewers have covered almost all the strengths of this wonderful movie, so there is really nothing I can add here except a reviewer-neglected element: the music.There are two pieces, one by Bjork and another by Sting for the credits that are really really good. All other music is composed by Eric Serra as far as I know.Eric Serra is known for collaborating with Luc Besson, and here for Leon he puts out one of his best scores. It is well written, and very well edited together into the film. Turn off the music, and you will see how much tension it serves up in scenes like the slaughter/""please open the door!"" scene, e.g. when the slick hair goon turns toward Leon's apartment suspecting Mathilda just went in there, the music reflects his escalating threat. The soundtrack also features well crafted sound effects that go along very well with the footage -- it is not just music in the traditional sense.The character themes, Mathilda's Tony's Leon's really fit the Wagnerian ideal of using music to define a character. Leon the cleaner's theme is especially moving, yearning frustration loneliness despair. This is one of the most memorable character themes, up there with classics such as Darth Vader's Imperial March. You see Leon the cleaner, you hear the music. You hear the music, you feel Leon the cleaner.The music that is used during the montage scenes (e.g. the gum trick and hitting clients to rhythmic electronica) works great.Enough reading my lame comments, if you have not done so, go and see this movie!",Léon - The Professional
1105,Catupiry,Not exactly what I expected,6,19 May 2015,"I don't understand all the hype about this movie,there are absolutely nothing special about it, the main idea of the movie was already used before! there are some really ""hollywoodian"" scenes that are frustrating to see how much fake it is, and not only the action scenes; I don't think that a 12 year old girl that smokes would be amazed by that piggy excuse to make the movie more sentimental. At least there are some good acting, Gary Oldman did a nice job; Jean Reno was also nice; Natalie Portman was good enough for a child. But, in compensation, there are some really bad actors that ruins most of the good acting.",Léon - The Professional

1107,duccttapemedia,Greatest hit-man movie ever!!,10,4 August 2015,"You know how certain actors are perfect for a role, like Pacino in ""Scarface"", Pesci in ""Goodfellas""or Gere in ""American Gigolo""? This was that movie for Jean Reno. He will always be known as ""Leon"". I can't recall a movie that captivated me as much as this movie did. The relationship between he and Natalie Portman's character was so endearing yet so borderline scandalous. He was a thoroughbred to the end. Gary Oldham was the icing on the cake in this film, when he told his eventual victim that he could tell he ""didnt like ""Beethoven"", classic.I waited for a part two but am glad they didn't ruin the product by attempting to out due the original.",Léon - The Professional
1108,evanatwood,An Unclassifiable Classic,10,16 August 2015,"This is a movie difficult to classify in any genre - which is a big part of what makes it a seemingly timeless classic.Other reviews have described in detail the essentials of the plot, and the chemistry between the actors, so I will not go over such things in any detail. Rather, I will concentrate on my impressions while watching this movie for the first time - which I did just the other week.For years, I had been vaguely aware of this film, but I never bothered to check it out. The reason was that I assumed that it was basically a ""mob movie"" about a hit-man - a genre I'm not particularly interested in. Which, in once sense, it is. However, it is much more than that, as I discovered when I finally got around to seeing it.When I started watching this movie, at first I found my impressions confirmed, as it opens with an apparently unstoppable mob assassin 'hitting' a group of drug dealing mooks. This opening scene was interesting in that the viewer never sees the killer directly - only in hints. This adds to the sense he's like a shadow or a ghost, an unstoppable force.However, the viewer soon discovers he's very much a human - and a sad, lonely one at that, living a marginal life in a slum with only his plant for company. At the same time, the viewer is introduced to Mathilda, the young neighbor girl who lives next door - who also lives a sad, lonely and miserable life.Soon, the unstoppable assassin saves the young girl from the hit squad of drug-dealing cops- and that's when the movie changes ... from a more typical mob shooter into something very like a (very) dark romantic comedy/drama. This I was not expecting. I was sort of expecting that the hit man would protect the girl, who would be more of a non-entity - a ""MacGuffin"" if you will (a joke they employ in the movie itself - at one point, she registers them in a hotel under the name ""MacGuffin"").As a viewer, I watched the unfolding sexual tension between the girl and the killer with uneasiness and dismay. Which appears to have been exactly the point the film-maker was making. The viewer is kept uneasy, not knowing exactly where this relationship is going - just how transgressive it is going to be ... is Mathilda actually ""in love"" with Leon? Is this ""love"" returned? Or is Mathilda just manipulating Leon to convince him to help her carry out her revenge? The answer appears to be a bit of ""yes"" to all the above - though Leon displays no sexual interest in Mathilda, he clearly grows to ""love"" her (in the sense of wanting what is best for her, even above his own self-interest).Mathilda, on her part, is certainly not above lying and manipulation in order to get what she wants. While she expresses her love for him repeatedly, to the point of outright propositioning him for sex, it is pretty clear that this sexual aggressiveness is the result of her abusive upbringing and her desire for adulthood - to her, it would seem, ""love"" means ""sexual love"" only, as she has never seen any other kind (other than ""cuddling"" with her baby brother). She both needs Leon (to carry out her revenge) and ""loves"" Leon (the only adult who has ever been kind to her). In that context, her declarations are both an attempt to bind Leon to her, a sort of manipulation, and the only expression of an ""adult"" type love she can understand.The point is that this is a surprisingly deep and sensitive exploration of a relationship, and nothing like what one would expect from a typical action movie. For me at least, this raises the movie to the level of a classic.",Léon - The Professional
1109,alexandralaurennyc,Timeless Classic,10,28 November 2017,I absolutely loved this film. Luc Besson did a phenomenal job at capturing the relationship between Leon and Mathilda.

The important that can be drawn from this production in every way is incalculable from the simplest of its planes as each line in their dialogues highly recommend it if your passion is in the film. the sentiments expressed by the interpreter and characters by Nathalie jean are the closest to true love in my opinion, a clean and unpretentious feeling, direct and fearless, with a innocent madness between two people of different ages but souls equal",Léon - The Professional
1111,sdalligan,Must See Movie...,10,9 February 2017,"Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is one of the best films i've had the pleasure of watching. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year- old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other.",Léon - The Professional

He spends his life alone paying full attention to each small things. Twelve year old Natalie Portman plays Mathilda , girl who lives in the same floor on the same building as that of Leon. Her family is brutally murdered by a corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stanfield. Gary Oldman plays the role of Norman Stanfield. Mathilda turns to Leon for help. She shows him a glimpse of how brilliant a normal life can be. She sort of gets fascinated by his job as cleaner and asks him to train her. The rest of the movie is all about how their friendship grows and Jean ready to give anything for her. At last they take their revenge.The performance of young Natalie is not so brilliant though she manages the transition from a frightened child to a woman capable of killing very well. Reno has shown some excellent piece of acting. He has an expressive face and he has successfully shown the life of a professional killer. Gary Oldman has shown his psychic ability. As a corrupt cop he has shown what evil is , and it is a joy to watch him.There are a lot of awesome moments in this film and must watch movie according to me.",Léon - The Professional

The Professional is a stunning piece of cinema that is near perfect, and displays an exhilarating, well paced plot that boasts impressive performances all around. I can watch this a million times....even back-to-back. This film was absolutely amazing. I have spent hours re-watching various scenes and noticing all the perfection with which they are acted and directed. It's not the violence or action sequences that make this movie so great, but rather moments like where Mathilda knocks on Leon's door. It would be so easy to just film the door opening, but instead we see light illuminating Natalie Portman's face, symbolizing something angelic.

All events in Leon were predicted which makes me consider it a cheap movie, although it came out back in 1994 and I'm only watching it now.

Well, there was a lot more to it than that. First of all, Natalie Portman was incredible in it, as she played Mathilda, a twelve-year old girl forced into a life of crime from a young age. She was a character you could laugh, cry and sympathise with. Jean Reno played Léon, the caring father/hit-man who takes in Mathilda after her family is brutally murdered, and you can feel the bond of the two dysfunctional characters as Mathilda learns the trade of ""cleaner"" and Léon learns to love again.

It does not turn childish and cute as one may think. It is not another cliché film where the bad guy is turned to good by the love of a child.

If this little girl doesn't break your heart, you'd better check to be sure you still one.Gary Oldman demonstrates that he is one of the finest actors with his over-the-top portrayal of drug-crazed DEA Agent Norman Stansfield. It has been said better by other writers, but Oldman disappears inside of each character he plays.

Stopped watching just when the last fight scene was about to start... After watching movies over the years, realized Leon is just another flick made by Hollywood with all the formulas and recipes they use repeatedly to make the mass dumber and dumber. The dialogues were so awful. Both the main actors were unbearable this time around. The so-called anti hero is given a set of activities to make him look villainous...

1128,volad,top 250?,6,8 February 2006,"It's surprising that ""Leon"" is so highly ranked (as of Feb. 2006), as it is so weak in so many respects. There are basically two things that it is trying to give us: (1) great one-elite-versus-many-soldiers-shoot-em-up sequences; and, what would make this movie special, if it worked, (2) a view into a very unusual and interesting relationship, with tinges of father/daughter, of master/apprentice, criminal/partner, and of lover/lover.It delivers decent shoot-em-up, but fairly little that stands out much from the vast quantities of decent material of that kind in 90s (and 00s) Hollywood film. If you *love* that kind of thing, you won't be disappointed.On the other hand, the relationship idea suffers from weak execution. Some of the specific plot and script ideas are to blame, but N. Portman is basically unbelievable, for the most part, and in a boring way. J. Reno is excellent, and there is some ""chemistry"" there, but there were just too many times when the cinematic illusion was broken and I just wanted to roll my eyes---the fascinating premise disappeared and I found myself thinking things like ""man, what a dumb line"". (Nothing as bad as the intimate scenes of Portman/Christensen in the Star Wars movies, which feel like a caricatured rendering of the interior imaginations of an inexperienced fifteen-year-old reading a mediocre discount store romance novel. But that's not saying much.)So, I suggest that ""Leon"" does not deserve to be in the company of nearby-ranked action-oriented films (""Das Boot"", ""Se7en"", ""Alien"", ""Fight Club"") or noir (""Maltese Falcon"", ""Chinatown"", ""LA Confidential"").I should add that I believe I saw the ""U.

1129,arvind_gupta-87131,One of the best movies of all time.,10,1 August 2017,"This is the first time I'm writing a review for a movie. This movie is so hauntingly beautiful I just had to write this.Leon: The Professional is about a hit-man and a 12-year-old girl that he saves and shelters (though reluctantly at first). The relationship between these two evolve as the movie progresses and touches a wide spectrum of emotions including father-daughter, mentor-protégé and you can't help but notice the slight sexual tension. But to say that the movie has pedophilic tendencies would be plain wrong. Mathilda is a an abused child who has no mother, and the father who is always abusing her, her elder half-sister is no good either. When she is loved and cared for the first time by Leon she thinks she is in love with him, her body-changes at age of 12 doesn't help matters either. I am not judging what she or she doesn't feel, I'm just trying to put things into perspective. Leon on the other hand has a loveless life and has been alone for several years and his feelings towards Mathilda is more like a father.The movie is great in so many levels it's hard to describe in words exactly what makes it what it is. Talking about the technical aspects - the acting is absolutely great, as is direction and cinematography. All in all I'd not want to have anything added or taken away from the movie, it just is so brilliant and perfect the way its is. I was especially surprised by Portman who played the character so brilliantly I don't see anyone else playing it. Reno and Oldman were brilliant too, I liked Oldman's portrayal of a corrupt and psychopath DEA officer. His weird rituals before taking his pills, the way he twitched and tilted his head while supposedly chewing it. And who can forget his famous line ""Bring me everyone...EVERYONE"". I don't know about anyone else but I couldn't help myself laughing out loud hearing this and the way he said it. And last but not the least Reno portrayed the haunted loner so well you can't help but feel so deeply for him.Being the movie buff I am I had a strong feeling how the movie would end (and I was right) but as the movie progresses and the characters took a place in my heart I wanted myself to be wrong. You just can't help but feel so strongly for the two leads. The ending scene was absolutely beautiful and poetic as the camera gives us the aerial shot of Mathilda, the plant and New York as the song ""Shape of My Heart"" plays. To me it was THE most hauntingly beautiful endings I've ever scene in a movie especially because of the song.I advise everyone to watch the uncut version which is like 2hr 12min long to fully understand and appreciate the movie.",Léon - The Professional

1132,dontheluckyone,Leon,10,22 November 2017,"have long thought that owning films on DVD or video is a waste of money - you watch them once and after that they are left to fester at the back of a cupboard. Occasionally I make an exception - some films simply cannot be fully appreciated on just one viewing. Every time I watch Leon is as gripping and enjoyable as the first. Sad, funny, violent, incredibly touching - few films manage to tick all the boxes and even fewer are about hit men.It obviously helps when your leading man has as much screen presence as Jean Reno. Thin and wiry with toilet brush hair and a face like a bag of spanners, he is hardly your typical gun-toting action hero, but he has an innocence and compassion that makes you fall for him instantly. Leon's life is as simple as a small child's: TV, lashings of milk and the odd gangland assassination. He cannot read, he doesn't sleep, he hasn't the trappings of family or wealth (the fees for his hits are habitually triggered by his 'benefactor': sleazy small-time Italian gangster Tony (Danny Aiello)) - In short, he lives like a robot. And then he meets Mathilda.Normally I can't stand Hollywood kids. They are all dopey-eyed, bouffant-haired brats who can cry on cue and are always ready with a cutesy, smart-ale comment that will cause their adult co-stars to tinkle with laughter or tousle their hair playfully. Often they are kidnapped and huge ransoms demanded while their parents go demented with worry. I for one am usually rooting for the kidnappers.Natalie Portman's Mathilda is the antithesis of these Dawson's Creek actors-in-waiting. For starters, she has something justifiable to gripe about, in that her entire family has just been slaughtered by Gary Oldman and his gang of crooked DEA officers. This is a bit of a blow, to say the least, but Mathilda takes it all in her stride and teams up with Leon in a bid for revenge. So begins one of the stranger relationships in silver screen history, but one of the most memorable.",Léon - The Professional

It was a Sunday afternoon and my father had just come back from our local movie rental place, and he said to me: ""hey boy.. check this movie out...you are going to love it"" of course, I didn't believe him but since I had nothing else to do, I gave it a try... two hours later I was shock yet relieve, sad yet happy and so emotional tired that I could't stand up from the couch.The acting, the writing, the photography, the music and the direction are to die for... even to kill for...jejeje.If I have to resume this film in one word, there's no other than: PerfectionWell, I not going to tell you any spoilers and ruin you the experience is going to be to watch this beautiful movie so...Do your self a favor, don't waste your time in any other rubbish and go see it NOW.",Léon - The Professional

But I would not call him a militant, rather a drama.Thanks to an excellent selection of cast members Jean Reno in the title role, the image of an experienced killer who, despite his terrible profession, remained in the soul of an infantile young man who met young Mathilde on his way and decided to end his dirty career for her - was uncovered completely, by all paints of inner emotional experience.The dynamics of the plots constantly keep the nerves at the limit, in anticipation of the fatal outcome of the movie heroes of this tape, while from within the subconsciousness there is a desire to destroy this Stan - the head of the ruthless gang of employees, the turn of the anti-narcotics department.This film will forever remain on the list of the best films I've watched.",Léon - The Professional
1141,sick_poo_slaughterer,Luc Besson at hist best !!!,8,9 March 2009,"""Leon the professional"" is one of those movies that will certainly leave you in awe after the first viewing. The plot is quite intriguing and original at the same time. It beautifully describes the story of a lonely and sad hit-man whom faith has bestowed the future of a smart but troubled little girl after her family was brutally murdered by a group of local corrupt policemen.The acting is very strong indeed. Natalie Portman delivers a top-notch performance in her breakthrough role as the distraught and very atypically 12 year old Mathilda who seeks revenge after the savagely killing of her family(especially of her little brother whom she cared for the most).IMO a performance worthy of an Academy Award nomination. Gary Oldman again accustoms us with a sharp delivery in the role of the villain who leads the pack of criminals. The portrayal of a psycothic and delusional corrupt officer is both convincing and unique at the same time. But the real tear-jerker is brought by Jean Reno's Leon character, a very innocent and warm-hearted hit-man(talk about great screenplay) who leads a desperate life of solitude until he meets Mathilda who will change him forever(the only thing that he was afraid to start with). Through the building up of the character you cannot simply be a stone-cold rock and not feel sympathy for Leon's struggle with the concept of love.The chemistry between him and Mathilda during the father-daughter relationship is awesome. A great cast overall but in the end it's Portman who steals the show!Also a huge compliment must be brought to the cinematography of the movie. Scenes like the angelic aura that surround Mathilda when Leon opens the door and implicitly saves her life or the one in which the same Leon bats itself with 2 handguns out from the ceiling of his apartment and right into the swarm of special-ops troops-men are beautifully and artistically created. Another big player is the melodic part which only adds up to the intensity of the on-going drama.To sum it all up Luc Besson once again amazes us after the huge successfully 'Le femme fatal Nikita' in creating a masterwork that touches you very deep emotionally and makes you very compassionate towards it's characters. Having fulfilled it's role as a film the only regret that this movie can possibly have is being 'born' in what i regard as 'movies annus dominis' along masterpieces like 'The shawshank redemption', 'Pulp Fiction' or 'Forrest Gump' thus cutting loose any change of critics recognition at Oscars(which is quite deserving for such a film)",Léon - The Professional

Killer, take people's money, and eliminate people's disasters; there is no right or wrong, only interests. They are cold at emotions but have the strong desire to break something down. That is essential for killers.Some people say that this is a story about uncle and loli. Uncle saves the loli, and loli warms uncle. Master, benefactor, father or daughter or lover? The love and hate between the two is also the topic of most film reviews. But here, I want to talk about the bad policeman who pushed the two to the desperate situation, the Stansfield that makes the audience hate.In most of the dramas, the villains exist to promote the plot or to highlight the heroic image of the hero. But if there is no evil, there is also no justice, the shaping of a good villain image can greatly lift up the realm of the film, and if a villain makes you look at the hatred, it just shows that the actor's acting is in full swing.2
Stansfield is bad and cruel.He is a black policeman. He is both black and white. In the face of drug dealers, Stansfield is playing black against black. The father of Mathilda in the film was killed because he hided a pack of drugs.Stansfield loves music, especially Beethoven's impassioned prelude.When Stansfield opened the killing ring at Mathilda's house, the soundtrack of the film switched to a symphony. This is exactly the murderous rhythm in Stansfield's heart. When the first hit didn't hit the sister, he wanted to continue to pursue a step, but it seemed to be a mess. He stopped, he returned, opened the bathroom door and shot the wife in the bathtub. The drums stepped on, the rhythm was up, the shell was changed, and the bomb continued to move forward. It was also a strong beat. The crazy-escape sister was hit from behind. He strode to the living room and threw the gun on one side. Putting the hands together, like a dragon-snake-separated bead curtain, came to the front of the frightened father of Mathilda. At this point, 1 minute just has passed, the time is exactly 12:01.This cruelty and bloody, I was very impressed in my heart when I was 7th grade, and my heart was full of fear for this well-dressed villain, especially when he looked at the camera with the most stunned face. As Hitchcock said, the explosion is not terrible, and it is terrible to wait for the explosion.The next paragraph is a godsend. In the face of the treacherous Mathilda father, Stansfield began to talk endlessly about Beethoven and Mozart's music. He suspected that Mozart's music was too light, and the latter part of Beethoven's music was boring. It's because the music in the second half doesn't have the passion at the beginning. He hasn't killed Father Mathilda yet. Finally, he said to Father of Mathilda, a man who is about to die, ""you should listen to Brahms again, he's also very good.""Killing seems to be a rhythmic art for Stansfield, even if it is killing, it is also about the inner tempo. This performance, the literary, neurotic and mad side of Stansfield, is reflected in the killing of the Mathilda family, even the 4-year-old boy, but because Mathilda's father broke his new suit, he became very angry.3
Stansfield is very bad, and he also has a ""belt.""Stansfield felt panicked and worried when his men were killed by Léon on their own site. But he decided to start with a strong in advance, as a policeman with a ""belt"", he has power, he can instruct his Everyone to besieged Léon and Mathilda, and he only needs to be commanded downstairs without risking any risk. .If it is about individual combat capability, Stansfield is definitely not to Léon, but in the end Stansfield alone killed Léon, Stansfield's insidious blackmail is reflected here. When he saw Léon's identity, he did not arrest him directly. Instead, he deliberately removed the police on the first floor and left Léon with a chance. When Léon went to the light with hope, he did not expect the guns of the black hole behind him...
Why is Stansfield doing this? I think there are three reasons:First, Léon is a professional killer. If you arrest directly on the spot, you will encounter Léon's strong resistance and even more casualties. If you arrest it, you will hand it over to the court for a long trial process. In the process, the variables are too many, their own illegal things may also be revealed, which is unfavorable;Second, surrounded by three sides, leaving only one way out can force Léon to get into his own trap, and in the emotional condition of Léon's escape from being extremely excited, his sensitivity as a professional killer will drop. The success rate of shooting behind is higher;Third, he can avenge his enemies, revenge for his dead men, and also pass his own murder.Not afraid of bad guys, afraid that the bad guys have both power and mind. From the results, Léon escaped the encirclement of two hundred special policemen with guns and live ammunition, but fell under the gun of the villain.4
It is much harder to play a villain role than to play a decent character, because in most cases, whether an actor can grasp the spiritual core of a character is closely related to his life experience, and most of the actors' personal experiences are not bad people, so they It's hard to play well.This is also the result of the actor's profiling in most literary and artistic works, either bad or too bad on the surface, or intimidating the audience to give people a deep impression. Stansfield's role in Leon is successful. It is not like the complexity of some literary works, blurring the boundaries between good and bad, Stansfield is always bad from beginning to end, But the bad is deeply rooted in the hearts of the audience.",Léon - The Professional

You can make a movie with a fantastic original story, but if the viewer does not really care about what happens to the characters of the movie, everything becomes completely irrelevant and all interest in the movie disappears. This problems do not interfere with the movie: Leon the professional in any way. Both the story and the characters are so well-constructed that you get riveted from start to finish. The film is based on the professional assassin Léon, who as a result of a tragic accident, has to take care of the 12-year-old girl Mathilda. A special bond is tied between them and both learn from each other. In addition, the film also features well-performed action scenes that are built up from a color palette of feelings that both make the spectator laugh, feel sad and cling to the seat in tension. The actual acting must also be considered to be of the highest standard. Both Jean Reno who plays Léon and Natalie Portman who plays Mathilda are also outstanding in their respective roles. It's rare to forget about watching a movie and it's not real people that you are watching.

1154,GregMcS,"Léon (in U.S. and Canada, The Professional)",8,4 July 2006,"Luc Besson has been justifiably accused of valorizing style over content, and The Professional is a minor stylistic masterpiece. The psychological realism of the script is in continual tension with the recurring wide-angle and long-perspective camera. Faces are examined in extreme close-up or from below, and the camera is often aimed down the long, narrow corridors of interior architecture (the scene in Mathilda's apartment when she's gone to buy milk, for example, or in the mens' room of a government building when she is confronting a villain). This is New York--and American movie culture--as seen through the eyes of a European artist, and Besson's vision performs the interesting task of familiarizing the good old North American version of a crime thriller. Jean Reno is suitably semi-opaque as Léon, and Natalie Portman is utterly mesmerizing as Mathilda in her film debut. Gary Oldman is Gary Oldman: not an inch of scenery goes unchewed.

1158,emielvc,4 Different Movies,7,25 August 2018,"Léon is a very fun movie, with an outstanding performance from the young Nathalie Portman. The balance of its strange sence of humour, the abnormal romance, the young girl committing crimes and of course the presence of all the action makes the movie great to watch not only at fridaynight.However my experience with watching this film was that it made mee feel a little uncomfortable with its structure. The 'first part', as what I am referring to as the part from the very beginning untill Mathilda knocks on Léons door, the movie seemed like an ironic actionmovie with strange but great scenes. This was unexpected because people would expect a serious relationship coming up between Léon and Mathilda.That's why there is the 2nd part. The part the movie get's more serious in any way. You see Mathilda and Léon growing an relationship, there's only a little doubt whether it's a father and doughter relationship or it's just love between those two. In the 3rd part, where we actually see them really loving each other, wich was kind of expected, the movie feels like just another romantic movie with a guy who cannot love anymore...At the grand finale the movie made clear it came straight from hollywood. The overuse of explosions, and just action in general. The unrealistic (almost) surviving of Léon and the killing of the villain at the end is a real anticlimax for the film. At first, everything seemed funny and ironic. Then it became serious because there was an interesting relationship going on, but the unrealistic end destroys the rest of the movie.One thing you can't discuss is the stunning acting from Portman troughout the film. There are loads of ways to the describe it but there is no way to do that negatively. On the other hand I think Reno played a little boring role. He needed to be a cold killer because of his merciless past. I get it he had to play a feelingless man and he did it well. I just don't think he was the right man to play it. Here's why: People like him, people with a traumatic and unforgivable past, should indeed be acting like that and should indeed have a face like that but, you should read their former pain in their eyes, and I don't think I have really seen it in the eyes of Jean Reno. He did feel emotionless, but it felt like that for almost the whole movie wich is a little boring. The mysterious eyes from someone else would have made the character have a little more depth.
Léon is a mix between a comedy, a romantic drama and an artificial action movie. But none of it really dominates the movie so it is in that way a unique movie. Just with a little anticlimax.",Léon - The Professional
