0,TheLittleSongbird,A not so freaky Friday,3,12 January 2018,"'Friday the 13th' may have been panned by critics when first released but since then it is one of the most famous and influential horror films, the franchise containing one of horror's most iconic villains. The film is popular enough to become a franchise and spawn several sequels of varying quality and generally inferior to the one that started it all off. It is very easy to call the 2009 'Friday the 13th' as a remake, for reasons that are easy to understand. Personally am actually to judge 'Friday the 13th' (2009) as a reboot rather than a remake. While not quite as bad as has been said, it even fails by reboot standards. There was no point to it whatsoever, the series should just have stopped at the last sequel and even then the series was severely fatigued, the fifth or sixth for me was the last watchable 'Friday the 13th' film, and there is very little to recommend it judging it as an overall film. Entries like 'Jason Takes Manhattan' and 'Jason X' may have been heavily problematic and less than mediocre, but credit is due to them for trying to do something different. 'Friday the 13th' (2009) has very few ideas of its own and the very few attempted were either cheaply executed (such as an out of character Jason), felt like they were lifted from another film (too many of the deaths are sadistic enough to be near-'Saw' territory) and more horror genre clichés done to death.The story is suggestive of the series being completely stale and takes forever to get going after the first 20 minutes, with very little happening and with a lot of gratuitous, cheap and pointless elements. Apart from one respectable performance, the acting is horrendous even by 'Friday the 13th' standards, the characters are ones you want dead fast and have nothing interesting about them and the dialogue would likely make even more forgiving people embarrassed. The ending is far too abrupt and anti-climactic, as well as going too far with the ridiculousness.Very few of the deaths are that memorable or disturbing, they're just too sadistic and paced too fast to make much impact. There is a severe shortage of suspense and scares, next to zero in both departments past the opening, replaced instead by childish humour and an overdose of gore, nudity and profanity that adds nothing. Pacing is erratic and the direction is often lifeless, especially in most of the first half. Can remember very little distinguished or memorable about the music, mostly one of the series' best assets now completely forgettable here.Despite these many drawbacks, there are positives. The first 20 minutes were absolutely great, it was tense, scary, clever, suspenseful and compelling. It actually gave the feeling that the series had redeemed itself.Technically, apart from some slapdash MTV-like editing that just didn't belong the production values were stylish and atmospheric.Although no Kane Hodder, Derek Mears is a wholly respectable and imposingly unsettling Jason. Overall, started off so well and then went downhill like water down the plughole. 3/10 Bethany Cox",Friday the 13th
1,Leofwine_draca,The worst Friday yet,2,10 December 2011,"Of all the horror remakes of recent years, Friday THE 13TH has to be one of the worst. The reason? Because it fails to find a voice and style of its own, content instead to derivatively copy the look and feel of a dozen inferior horror outings such as WRONG TURN and THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake. It starts off by following the plot of the first three films – featuring Mrs Vorhees, sack-head Jason and hockey mask Jason – before falling apart entirely with cliché after cliché as the killer goes after a bunch of dull people.This film fails because it doesn't have a single interesting character – least of all bland Jason, who doesn't have anything approaching the brutality of the killer once played by Kane Hodder. The victims are all of them irritating and faceless, so you'll look forward to seeing them die – except even the death scenes are unmemorable. A week after watching this and I don't recall a single murder from the film, it's that dull and lacking in creativity. The filmmakers throw in plenty of nudity in an attempt to liven things up, but needless to say it's not enough to sustain the movie. Even the godawful sequels, like JASON TAKES MANHATTAN, were better than this!",Friday the 13th
2,SnoopyStyle,Good slasher movie,6,1 January 2014,"A group of kids are camping at Crystal Lake. They find some marijuana plants, and ... Jason. Now 6 weeks later, another group has arrived at a lake house. Meanwhile Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) is in the area searching for his sister Whitney (Amanda Righetti) from the previous massacre.This is a good traditional slasher movie. Jared Padalecki has the boyish charm to be lead hero. And he plays an interesting character. He isn't just some clueless young party animal. He gives a different dynamic to the traditional slasher movie. On the other hand, there is a need for more Amanda Righetti if she is going to be so prevalent in the final battle. The kills are good, but there are still a couple of problems. There isn't anything original. So I'll just give it a passing grade.",Friday the 13th
3,claudio_carvalho,Let Jason Rest in Peace,4,26 July 2009,"Wade (Jonathan Sadowski), Ritchie (Ben Feldman), Amanda (America Olivo), Mike (Bick Mennell) and Whitney (Amanda Righetti) travel to Crystal Lake to camp, but Wade and Ritchie have found a plantation of weed and intend to raise some money selling the dope. However, the group is brutally attacked by Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears). Six weeks later, Clay (Jared Padalecki) is seeking out his sister Whitney in Crystal Lake, distributing a missing poster with her picture to the locals. In a gas station, he stumbles with the arrogant Trent (Travis Van Winkle) that has invited his friends Jenna (Danielle Panabaker), Lawrence (Arlen Escarpeta), Chewie (Aaron Yoo), Nolan (Ryan Hansen), Chelsea (Willa Ford) and Bree (Julianna Guill) to spend the weekend in the cottage of his wealthy family. Jenna teams up with Clay in his quest and they discover that Jason is killing her friends. They run back to the cottage to warn her friends of the dangerous situation while Jason kills each one of them. ""Friday the 13th"" is an unoriginal and flawed collection of clichés with the omnipresent and indestructible Jason Voorhees. The story follows the same pattern of the other screenplays, with breasts and naked bodies of beautiful girls, drugs, booze, a group splitting and violent deaths. The imbecile conclusion of this sequel is terrible, and I hope that Jason had said ""hi"" to his mommy as recommended by Whitney and rest in peace without any other sequence, rip-off or remake. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Sexta-Feira 13"" (""Friday the 13th"")",Friday the 13th
4,kosmasp,Every now and then,4,15 August 2010,"... there will be a Friday 13th. No seriously, look it up in your calendar! I guess it happens a couple of times in a year ... thankfully the movies don't come along that often though. Though I had a chance to meet Derek Mears personally (and he is more than a cool cat, infectious with his passion for Jason and his stunt work in general), I just can't like this movie that much.Not that it is bad per se. Quite frankly for some it wasn't bad enough. Meaning that the roughness of the original, which this was supposed to kick off again, has gone and out came this stylized product. While in some aspects it has rough edges (shaky cam which reminded me of the TCM remake ... directed by who? Exactly!), the overall feeling is that of a polished product.If you can cope with that and are an avid Friday fan (which I have to admit I'm not, still having watched every Jason movie there is) you will see some things you are familiar with. The movie is an origin Story and it has quite a few scenes that deal with things you are familiar with. Nice killings, quite a few exposed beautiful women and great SFx. It's up to you, if that weighs more than disposable characters, you won't even remember while you are watching the movie. And it always was about Jason with this movies anyways, wasn't it?",Friday the 13th
5,gavin6942,"Little Substance, Weak Style, But Great Entertainment",6,14 February 2009,"A group of young adults, some in search of the elusive illegal herb, stumbles upon Camp Crystal Lake, where a legend tells of a boy who grew up to be a killer. A few weeks later, another group enters that same woods. The body count begins to climb... is Jason back, and if so, can he be stopped? Let me make a confession: I really didn't want to like this movie. I loved the original series of films, I don't like remakes for the most part, and with Michael Bay's name attached, I knew it was going to be an action-packed film done in ADHD-ready music video format. Sadly, I wasn't wrong about the last part. However, the film as a whole isn't that bad.The Jason mythology is still here. His mother is still involved, there's still a hockey mask, and it all makes sense. I'm a little unclear as to why he has a home at Camp Crystal Lake (he has a permanent bed at a summer camp), but that's fine. We even have the brother off to find his little sister scenario, which hasn't been in the series since the 1980s... well done bringing back a one-dimensional character. Crazy Ralph isn't here, but an old woman does a weak job replacing him, which is better than nothing.If you're looking for sex, drugs and rock and roll, this film has it. Plenty of topless girl screen time (thanks, Willa Ford), although you should be warned that the two most attractive women (Whitney and Jenna) don't get naked. Sorry. Marijuana plants and bongs are around, as is the Pabst Blue Ribbon. Some might say ""if you only have PBR, you're out of beer"" but I disagree. As for the rock... they had Night Ranger's ""Sister Christian"". What more do you want? The theater audience I went with enjoyed singing along.Many good one-liner jokes, and the gore here is decent. I'm not going to say it's the best gore I've ever seen, but there's no shortage of bodies getting impaled, hacked up, shot with arrows... another reviewer summed this film up as ""killing spree"", and that couldn't be more true. There was almost no plot to speak of (this is the film's downfall), but how could there be when characters were getting killed off every five minutes? Derek Mears is a fine Jason. There is a better one -- Kane Hodder -- but Mears' version, where Jason looks like Darkman, is respectable. Despite all my misgivings about this film, it turned out to be alright. Not my favorite in the series, not by a long shot. But if you're into beautiful young people drinking, having sex and dying in bloody ways, this film should meet your criteria for quality. Next on the list, the ""Last House on the Left"" remake... if there's one film I think should have been left alone, that's it. But if they do as well as Marcus Nispel (a great guy, and director of one of the better ""Frankenstein"" incarnations) did on this one, it has a chance.",Friday the 13th
6,jboothmillard,Friday the 13th,4,15 January 2012,"Two years after Rob Zombie remade Halloween with a new Michael Myers, and one year before A Nightmare on Elm Street was remade with a new Freddy Krueger, director Marcus Nispel, who remade The Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a new Leatherface, decided to remake not just the first film, but the original four all rolled into one. Basically the film opens with the crazy Pamela Voorhees (Nana Visitor) wanting to kill people being so distraught over the death of her son Jason, and she is killed. Years later, Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears), a deformed individual, has returned to take revenge for the death of his mother by going on a killing spree, and he doesn't care who it is. Camping out on the site where he was supposed to be dead, Camp Crystal Lake, are a group of teenagers, Wade (Jonathan Sadowski), Richie (Ben Feldman), Amanda (America Olivo), Mike (Nick Mennell) and Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti). On the site is a plantation of weed (marijuana), and the gang planned to take loads of it and sell it off, but of course Jason shows up and slaughters them all. Six weeks later, Clay Miller (House of Wax's Jared Padalecki) is looking for his missing sister Whitney, and he has been joined by friends Jenna (Sky High's Danielle Panabaker), Lawrence (Arlen Escarpeta), Chewie (Aaron Yoo), Nolan (Ryan Hansen), Chelsea (Willa Ford) and Bree (Julianna Guill) to live in his wealthy family's mansion as he searches. Of course they too come across the place the young Voorhees was rumoured to have been drowned years ago, and one by one they all fall victim to Jason's brutal revenge. Jenna and Clay look like the two last two survivors, until they find Whitney chained up in the killer's secret hideout, and they are all running for their lives as he chases them, wearing his iconic hockey mask and holding his large machete. In the end, after many failed attempts, it does look like the last two living characters, the brother and sister, have successfully killed the seemingly indestructible psycho, but of course (just like the original 1980 version, Jason leaps out of the water. Also starring Travis Van Winkle as Trent, Richard Burgi as Officer Bracke and Chris Coppola, Francis Ford's nephew as Gas Station Attendant. Like many originals this does have some of the moments from the original films that you recognise, it seems the makers were more interested in the more popular premise seen in the sequels than the original with the mother, and Jason Voorhees does still make an impact as the silent but deadly psycho killer we have seen before, and of course the inventive and very bloody deaths are most watchable, it is obviously not original and can be flat at times, but it is an alright four-films remake horror. Okay!",Friday the 13th
7,Woodyanders,Middling attempt at reviving the popular horror franchise,5,23 December 2020,"We all know the drill: A bunch of party hearty young folks run afoul of lethal hockey-masked psycho Jason Voorhees when they make the fatal mistake of stumbling into Jason's neck of the woods.While director Marcus Nispel keeps the familiar, yet still fairly enjoyable story moving along at a brisk enough pace and stages the brutal'n'gruesome murders with appropriately sadistic aplomb, he alas crucially fails to generate much in the way of any essential tension or creepy atmosphere. Moreover, the mostly obnoxious and unappealing youths are such a bunch of utterly reprehensible beer-swilling, pot-smoking, sex-crazed dolts that it's impossible to be remotely upset whenever Jason bumps one of 'em off. Only Jared Padalecki as the likeable Clay Miller and Danielle Panabaker as the sweet Jenny manage to elicit any sympathy from the viewer. Derek Mears makes for a suitably menacing and ferocious Jason.The changes made to Jason are strictly hit or miss: Having Jason being able to run definitely works because it makes it harder for people to easily get away from him, but the whole subplot with Jason keeping the one gal alive in his underground lair simply because she looks just like his mom (huh?) is super dumb and lame. Fortunately, this movie certainly delivers on the tasty gratuitous female nudity and hot raunchy sex, with buxom blonde stunner Julianna Guill a notable stand-out in this particular department. But ultimately this reboot comes across as pretty perfunctory and by the numbers. In other words, it's basically yet another piece of slick'n'soulless Hollywood product that's competently done, but totally lacking in any genuine heart or passion.",Friday the 13th
8,Tweekums,Rebooting an 80s horror classic,6,21 January 2019,"After numerous sequels, and a crossover with 'Nightmare on Elm Street', one might have thought there was nothing left to do with the Jason Voorhees character... the creators of this reboot clearly thought otherwise. This film can be considered to be an alternate version of what happened after the original film. In a prologue we are told how Jason's mother killed the camp councillors she blamed for his death before being killed and how Jason, returned from the dead, witnessed this.A group of youngsters go to Crystal Lake, hoping to get stoned and engage in premarital sex, as they sit around the camp fire one of them tells the story of Jason... inevitably it isn't long before he is killing them. Six weeks later Clay Miller, the brother of Whitney, one of the missing girls, is in the area trying to discover what happened. Also arriving are another group of youngsters hoping to have a fun weekend by the lake. Soon Jason starts to pick them off one by one... it is just a question of how many will survive till the end.I'm not sure we needed another 'Friday the 13th' film but if you wanted one this has some good elements, as well as some weak ones. On the plus side the series returns to its spiritual home at Crystal Lake and the story feels like it could have come from early in the original series and the cast of potential victims are given proper characters. One the downside Jason's character has changed somewhat; he is still an unstoppable killing machine but now he is more sadistic; tormenting victims rather than going for the quick kill. More strangely in this he takes a prisoner; something he never did before. There is more sex and nudity than the earlier films; it is fairly gratuitous. There is of course a lot of violence... one can hardly complain about that in a slasher movie. The deaths are fairly varied and sometimes quite disturbing. The cast are decent enough, most notably Jared Padalecki and Amanda Righetti as Clay and Whitney Miller and Danielle Panabaker as Jenna. Derek Mears does a solid job as Jason; making him menacing and fast rather than the lumbering threat from before. Overall this is a decent enough addition to the series; not the best but certainly not the worst.",Friday the 13th
9,BA_Harrison,Friday the 13th 2009: unlucky for horror fans.,4,13 June 2009,"Neither a true remake, a re-imagining, nor a sequel, Marcus Nispel's Friday the 13th takes an alternate time-line following the infamous massacre at Camp Crystal Lake. Decades after the decapitation of Mrs. Vorhees, her deformed maniac son Jason is still lurking in the woods with a sack over his head. He has been a busy boy, building a hide-out at the deserted summer camp whilst hacking to death anyone who has dared step foot on his stomping ground (all with no intervention from the authorities).After a group of sex mad, hash smoking twenty-somethings searching for a secret marijuana crop become the latest victims of the hulking killer, Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki), the brother of one of the missing girls, goes in search of his sibling (Amanda Righetti). Whilst issuing 'missing' posters, Clay befriends Jenna (Danielle Panabaker), one of a bunch of friends partying in a nearby lakeside condo, and together they discover the terrible truth behind the Vorhee's legend.Admittedly, I'm not a huge fan of influential 80s slasher Friday the 13th, but compared to this modern take on the Jason Vorhees story, Sean S. Cunningham's original is a work of genius. Director Nispel's treatment of Shannon and Mark Swift's pedestrian screenplay is predictably slick, employing the same bag of flashy directorial tricks that made his remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre a hit with indiscriminate teen audiences the world over, but with little in the way of originality, a raft of irritating characters that consists primarily of unlikeable hunks and virtually indistinguishable bubble-headed bimbos, and a poorly considered narrative that sees Jason taking prisoners, discovering his iconic mask by accident, and being a dab hand with electrics, the result is stale, scare-free and, perhaps more pointedly, completely unnecessary.About the only thing Nispel does right is to get his tasty starlets to regularly strip off: viewers are treated to a spot of gratuitous topless wake boarding, a couple of enthusiastic shagging sessions, and one babe rubbing her breasts with baby oil. It adds absolutely nothing to the plot, but does distract one slightly from the fact that the film is a bit of a stinker.3.5 out of 10, rounded up to 4 for the oily cans.",Friday the 13th
10,paul_haakonsen,"It delivers well enough, but it was missing a key ingredient...",6,19 April 2014,"While I am a huge fan of the franchise, then this reboot or remake, call it what you will, is somewhat unnecessary. It would have been better, had director Marcus Nispel opted to go with something new to add to the franchise instead.However, that being said, then this 2009 version of ""Friday the 13th"" is still enjoyable, because it is still Jason Voorhees that we are talking about here. I just don't enjoy the fact that he is running around, because that is not something seen in the other movies.There is a good mood to the movie, traditional to all the movies in the franchise, and you know what you are in for when you sit down to watch the movie. And this 2009 movie doesn't fail to deliver. There is a fair amount of dead bodies piled up once the movie has ended. Although there is just something missing from the movie to make it as enjoyable as the rest of the franchise.Derek Mears as Jason Voorhees, well he sure ain't no Kane Hodder that's for sure. He did an average job, but he just didn't really bring any finesse or personality to the character.This movie is a good introduction to the franchise for those not already familiar with the movies - shame on you! And it does make for an adequate addition to the movie collection of any fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. But the movie just didn't stand out in any way.",Friday the 13th
11,Quinoa1984,"not a waste, not totally a bore, and not at all much good, it's a mid-range Jason flick at best and a turgid rehash at worst",5,13 February 2009,"Jason Vorhees has had quite a legacy over the last 30 years, and with this reboot/remake/rehash/re-whatever of Friday the 13th we get a 21st century blitzkrieg through the tropes and clichés of the first three films, give or take, and with more stupid and predictable and what-the-hell things thrown in. Logic is nil. Killings are multiple and occasional gleefully gory. And if you like your sex hot and with breasts and with a chaser of KILL then it's worth your while. This doesn't really mean this is any good, per-say, but at best it is a step-up from the director Marcus Nispel's totally abominable ""flashy"" remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre (some really like it a lot, more not-really power to them), as he keeps any bit stylistic flamboyancy to a minimum and just focuses on the basics.Those basics, of course, make it not original, at all. Even with a new tunnel-system under the Vorhees's house included, and some new techno gadgets like a GPS, not a whole lot distinguishes itself from former films... no wait, this time we get Jason Vorhees meets Cheech and Chong, sort of, as apparently a huge crop of cannabis is growing on the property, or adjacent to it, and it's almost like leading flies to butter. Why the weed grows right near his property when it would require, you know, effort to have such a crop is completely knuckle-headed writing to me. But at the least the film provides some cool and disgustingly stupid kills- the guilty pleasure kind in most cases- and some really wretched or silly one-note acting. It has the requirements down for a by-the-numbers slasher but it's because of this in a way that it doesn't go too far down hill.If it suffers from anything it's not having that insane and awesome sense of machete-to-the-ribs humor in Jason X and Freddy Vs Jason, the other 21st century installments to the franchise. I suppose now we'll see more of these to come, the sequels to the reboot of what was actually a rip-off of John Carpenter's Halloween to start with. No intelligence is required. At least they got the character, what little there is of him, down pat with the added bonus of hot teens and illogical feats like electricity at Jason's house and a convenient ability to leap buildings in a single cut-away.",Friday the 13th
12,BandSAboutMovies,Not a fan.,5,13 April 2018,"Marcus Nispel directed the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre in 2003, so why shouldn't he get a shot at Jason? This film is more than just a remake of the first film. It's really a bit of the first four all in one.We watch Jason as he watches his mother get killed by a camp counselor. Thirty years later, he kills every single teen who has comes to Crystal Lake looking for marijuana, except for Whitney, who reminds him of his mother.Weeks later, some rich kids come to stay at a fancy cabin. They're all fooder, too. Only Clay, Whitney's brother, can save her. Finally, Whitney acts like Jason's mother and stabs him, but he comes back at the end, rising from the lake.This is a slick, CGI animated take on the Jason mythos. I'm more into the Savini school of gore, so there's a lot of this that didn't work for me. It's not a horrible film by any means. But it's not the best of the series. And while it did well at the box office, it was also the end of the series.",Friday the 13th
13,Coventry,I'm a very unhappy camper!,2,16 August 2009,"Well, I learned at least one thing from watching this utterly pointless and frustratingly abominable new horror film ""Friday the 13th"" 2009 is NOT a remake of Sean S. Cunningham's notoriously classic 1980 film. This dud feels more like ten minuscule, but equally redundant, little remakes in one. Writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift (who also scripted the horror oddity ""Freddy Vs. Jason"") copy-pasted numerous ideas and little story elements from practically all the previous installments; especially the first four. The outcropping of such a formula is that the evolution of an entire horror franchise, including the vengeful Mrs. Voorhees' murderous rampage and Jason's metamorphosis from primitive killer with potato bag into master-slasher with hockey mask, is pushed to the background like it was some sort of insignificant footnote, and this all in favor of showing fresh-faced and abnormally horny new teenager characters. The writers duo, director Marcus Nispel and producer Michael Bay (him again) pretty much ruined the entire nostalgic value of ""F13"" for us, 80's kids, by sketching the whole thing like some sort of urban legend/campfire tale. The lead characters aren't campers or even indecent camp leaders; they're just ordinary weed-smoking and hormone- overloaded backpackers that talk about Jason Voorhees like he's a bad caricature and never existed. There are actually two unrelated groups of players hiking into the woods surrounding Crystal Lake and making an acquaintance with Jason. The first group exists of annoying junkies, but at least they act like friends. The second group are a bunch of people that clearly hate each other. The only normal guy is someone who's searching for his missing sister from the first group among the insupportable people of the second group. The emphasis purely lies on sex, while all the other essential horror ingredients (like suspense, atmosphere and even extreme bloodshed) are completely ignored. There are highly intellectual dialogs like ""Your tits are stupendous"" and sub plots that are thrown in but make absolutely no sense. What's with the girls locked up in the cellar? Is she still alive because her brother is looking for her? Or because maybe someone indicated that she looked like Jason's mother? I don't care what the reason is, it's senseless! Jason Voorhees doesn't take prisoners. Anyone who doesn't know that clearly didn't pay any attention throughout the eleven previous episodes! The acting performances are weak throughout and the massacres really aren't as gory as you would expect from a boisterous horror remake mostly aimed at young kids. On the rental DVD, there was a little extra feature called ""Hacking Back & Slashing Forward"" and it contains interviews with nearly all cast and crew members. Even though they talk about colorfully, I sincerely doubt that most of them even saw the original ""Friday the 13th"". They refer to it as one the most fundamental, influential and brilliant piece of film-making ever made. Um, no it wasn't! ""Friday the 13th"" was a guilty pleasure that wanted to cash-in on the trend of teen-slasher and just happened to be more successful than 99% of the other films in the same style.",Friday the 13th
14,michaelRokeefe,Rejuvenated Jason.,6,25 June 2009,"Director Marcus Nispel pumps new blood into the legend of Jason Voorhees. The violence is intense, the unique kills and nudity comes quicker.

15,hitchcockthelegend,Friday the 13th part?,4,9 October 2012,"Hee, with some of the reactions to Marcus Nispel's remake/reimaging/rekindling to the 1980 Friday the 13th movie, you would think he dared to take on a sacred cow. Having already alienated much of the horror loving world after his remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, this appears to be the final straw. However, and as much as I found this latest offering in the ""Friday"" franchise to be incredibly dull and unoriginal, the original movie isn't all that anyway. So with that in mind it wasn't sacrilegious to take this particular project on. So to judge Nispel's movie on its own new terms then...Here's the thing, maybe the director was stung by the vented spleen surrounding the Chainsaw remake? Where he added some new flavours and at least tried to put his own stamp on it. But this version just feels like an extension of the series, there's nothing new here, it may as well be called Friday the 13th part (insert whatever number it is up to now?). Sure, the blood is more flowing, the deaths grisly and there is nudity a go go, but so what? Vorhees stalks and kills youths in wood, whoopee, so what? I can watch any of the other films from the previous 30 years for that. In fact I can watch him do it in space, now that's originality!Yes, it's true, Jason Vorhees has become boring, even in a reimaging. One or two scenes score well, we like the switch from flour cloth to hockey mask, Jason's underground lair has visual/tense appeal, but other than that it's all so flat. Where a famed movie killer is in desperate need of pizazz, we get only a reason why he should either be left at the bottom of Crystal Lake, or taken elsewhere by film makers with imagination. 4/10",Friday the 13th
16,Scarecrow-88,Friday the 13th,5,14 February 2009,"Underwhelming, formulaic ""addition"" to the Friday the 13th franchise has hockey-masked psychopath Jason Voorhies killing a group of teenagers who make the unfortunate mistake of trespassing on his property, the wilderness and surrounding area of his home and Camp Crystal Lake. The film opens with Jason, as a boy, watching his mother being beheaded by the remaining survivor of a group of camp counselors(..this opening is incredibly disappointing and uninspired). He picks up a neck-laced locket with his mother's(..and his)picture inside. Years later, a group of teenagers are on the pursuit of marijuana, building a camp in the wilderness nearby Crystal Lake, falling prey to Jason(..at this point wearing a pillow case over his head with an eye hole cut to see). Whitney Miller(Amanda Righetti)watches as her boyfriend is attacked by Jason while they are touring through a ravaged house belonging to the killer's mom. Running like hell, she encounters her fallen friends and as Jason is about to drop his machete towards her face, the screen fades black(..a plot point to add:her boyfriend encounters the locket noting to Whitney that she favors the woman's picture). Whitney's brother, Clay(Jared Padalecki of ""Supernatural"" fame)is searching for her, probing the area of Crystal Lake hoping that a citizen might've recognized her, encountering locals who warn him to leave. Meanwhile, another group of partying teenagers decide to crash at the wealthy estate of Trent's(Travis Van Winkle) father. Jenna(Danielle Panabaker, who has blossomed into an attractive young woman), Trent's girlfriend, opts to assist Clay(..they seem to know each other as does Trent who does not embrace Clay's presence, seeing him as a threat, hostile towards him)in his search while others smoke dope and get wasted. Clay and Jenna discover some gruesome truths regarding Jason after finding the psychopath with a dead body draped over his shoulder. We will also discover what happened to Whitney along the way.I will admit that this remake/reboot/whatever looks fabulous..it is dark, gritty, and polished. Director Marcus Nispel and Platinum Dunes essentially give this film the same kind of look their TCM ""re-envisioning"" had. The film has all the bells and whistles money could buy but lacks that sense of fun the franchise always had..it's an exercise in weapons stabbing victims with characters running for their life or finding Jason's massive presence behind them. Jason is indeed a menace and kills with an authority everyone(..except one female character)in his path. It's simple really..if you invade his turf, you die a horrible death. The film is essentially a series of graphic violence towards teenagers..the machete rips through bodies a lot. Victims' backs are turned and the blade penetrates them all the way through(..we see their shocked reactions as the machettes bursts from their chest). Savage murders include an ax thrown at a victim as he retreats(..slamming into the guy's back), an arrow stabbing a victim driving a motorboat(..through the skull), a fireplace poker inserted through the eye of the local sheriff(..and through Trent's father's front door), a girl is ""antlered""(..an obvious homage to Silent Night, Deadly Night), one girl is trapped in a sleeping bag upside down over a camp fire, one guy's ankle gets caught in a bear trap with the bone and ripped flesh present(..also receiving a machete slammed into his face), one girl(..underneath a bridge in Crystal Lake hoping to avoid Jason)getting rammed directly into the skull by the tip of the machete, another victim slowly stabbed into the throat with a screwdriver, etc. Nispel often shoots the film at night..a moody, brooding, forbidding place where victims barely stand a chance. The wilderness and home of Jason around Camp Crystal Lake are a murky, decadent environment civilization has left to rot. Jason has no personality..he's simply a killing machine who awaits vulnerable victims, mainly when they are alone or in the middle of something. The cast is your basic stock group of attractive disposable teens, lambs to the slaughter, representing basic stereotypes we slasher fans know all too well. There's a pretty lame set-up for how Jason finds his hockey-mask. Nothing about this film is fresh or original, although many of the chase scenes are exciting accompanied by a pulse-poundingly loud musical score and frenzied camera attempting to capture the horror of it all, with ""jump scare"" sound effects ever present to make theater-goers scream with fright. I rather liked Padalecki and Panabaker..they are likable enough and not overbearing. The others meant nothing to me although, Julianna Guill is quite a sex kitten who sheds her clothes(..having sex with Trent who can not escape his lustful desire for her) and Willa Ford goes water boarding topless, so that was appreciated. For slasher fans only.",Friday the 13th
17,Hey_Sweden,An adequate rehash at best.,5,17 January 2013,"The iconic 1980 slasher film ""Friday the 13th"" gets reinvented for a 21st century audience, with passable results. Undemanding fans of modern horror should find enough to keep them watching, but overall this is too studio slick, too dark, and seriously lacking in the story telling department. Yeah, I know, the original series was never exactly strong on story, but here it's ALL about setting up the next gore gag. To add to that, the ""hip and attractive young cast"" is mostly so insufferably annoying that Jason can't possibly kill them soon enough. Again, that's not so different from the movies of decades past, but this aspect plumbs some new depths here. Just for the sake of informing newcomers about the exploits of brutal psychopath Jason Voorhees, this begins with a MUCH too brief back story - inserted into the opening credits, no less - in which Jasons' mother (Nana Visitor, in a cameo) is established as a madwoman who'd slaughtered camp counsellors in revenge for the ""death"" of her deformed child. Many years later, Jason is alive and well and butchering stupid people left and right. In the meantime, a young man named Clay (Jared Padalecki of 'Supernatural') is searching for his missing sister Whitney (Amanda Righetti), who'd been part of a group of kids that had previously encountered everybody's favourite hockey mask wearing killer. Coming from Michael Bay, his company Platinum Dunes, and director Marcus Nispel, those guys who had already put their own spin on ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"", it's no surprise that this puts a lot of stress on action and looks as dim as it does. Everything about this is generic - it's typical modern Hollywood product. At least the original movies, even if they weren't exactly great cinema, still had an infectious low budget charm to them. The comedy relief here stinks; too much time is spent with Aaron Yoos' dumb doper. The soundtrack is loud and disposable (although hearing Night Rangers' ""Sister Christian"" was amusing). The gore is fun, to a degree, but it lacks the artistry of, for example, Tom Savinis' work. Even Jason here is just not that scary. He's a sadistic s.o.b., to be sure, and is played with decent physical menace by Derek Mears, but it's not the same not seeing him bide his time or do much lurking in the background. Voyeurs can take some pleasure in admiring the frequent breast shots, in any event. The cast includes adorable Danielle Panabaker (she and Padalecki play the most likable people in the whole thing), Travis Van Winkle as one hell of a colossal jerk, America Olivo (""Bitch Slap""), and Richard Burgi (""Hostel: Part II""). When watching this, it's impossible not to have that feeling of having seen all of this too many times before - right up to the inevitable ""setting up the sequel"" ending. There's no heart here, and no soul, just a purely commercial venture that can only be soon forgotten. Five out of 10.",Friday the 13th
18,preppy-3,Great opening then it falls apart quickly,2,13 February 2009,"Pointless remake of the 1980 film. The film opens in 1980 in b&w. We quickly see Mrs. Voorhees (a different one from the original) killed off at Camp Crystal Lake. Then they cut to present day where a bunch of brainless 20 somethings go to Camp Crystal Lake and camp overnight. Jason pops up and kills them all. THEN they cut to 6 weeks later. ANOTHER bunch of brainless 20 somethings go to Camp Crystal Lake for a vacation. There they meet Clay (Jared Padalecki) who is searching for his sister who disappeared 6 weeks earlier.OK--I LOVE horror films. I own all the original F13 films on DVD. I've read some of the books about them. I was HOPING this would be good along the lines of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""My Bloody Valentine"" redos. No such luck. The opening 20 minutes or so are great. Fast, bloody and this Jason RUNS (making him scarier I think). Then it starts the proper story and everything falls to pieces. All the stereotypes are in place--the brainless blonds with huge breasts and zero acting talent; the jerk who's trying to impress everybody; the good girl who we KNOW will survive; the horny guys that act like idiots...every single clichéd character that was worked to death in the original and its sequels are trotted out again. The plot is basically just redoing bits of the various F13 movies. There's not an original thought in its head. Also no explanation of why Jason is still around when he supposedly drowned. Yes I know we accepted it in the originals but you think that would have done SOMETHING different with it. Jason also still has the ability to magically teleport to wherever the victims are. If this is a ""reimaging"" why bother using all the ""tricks"" Jason had originally? And since when does Jason take captives...and why?? (Don't bother asking the film--we never find out) I thought the point of redoing this was the change it and try something different. No such luck. The dialogue is terrible and all the characters (save for Clay and Jenna) are idiots. And the ending is bad enough to make any horror fan weep! The acting also is horrendous--worse than even the usual! There's also plenty of pointless female nudity. Does anyone remember that the first was a huge hit and had NO nudity whatsoever? Also the music score has been completely changed. No more cha-cha-cha-cha ha-ha-ha-ha. The killings themselves are OK--predictable but OK. The special effects were good also. I'm only giving this 2 stars for the opening 20 minutes. After that it's just a retread of all the sequels. I hope this bombs or we're gonna get hit with even worse sequels! This makes the original look like ""Gone With the Wind""!",Friday the 13th
19,poolandrews,Decent enough remake.,5,11 August 2009,"Friday the 13th is set at Camp Crystal Lake & starts in 1980 as a young Jason Voorhees (Caleb Guss) witnesses the decapitation of his mother (Nana Visitor) after she murdered a load of people in revenge for his death even though he's not dead if you know what I mean. Jump forward to the Present Day & Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) is in search of his missing sister Whitney (Amanda Righetti) who disappeared around the Camp Crystal Lake area about six weeks previous along with some of her friends. Clay runs into Trent (Travis Van Winkle) & some of his friends who are in the area to stay in his parents summer cabin, as Clay searches for his sister it becomes clear that Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) has grown up & is killing anyone who ventures anywhere near Camp Crystal Lake...Directed by Marcus Nispel this is a remake of the classic teen slasher flick Friday the 13th (1980) & out of the four big horror icon franchises this is the third to get the remake treatment after The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) & Halloween (2007) but before Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) which is the last big horror franchise/character to get the Hollywood remake makeover. Many seem to dislike remakes just because of what they are but I don't share that opinion & actually think the '03 The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is better than the original '74 one but this new Friday the 13th isn't anything special. Available in both a theatrical version & a longer by nine minutes 'Killer Cut' (just called an 'Extended Cut' here in the UK) I will be basing my comment on the extended cut since there's no way to see the original theatrical cut here in the UK as the DVD & Blu-ray only feature the longer version. I thought this started off quite well with the events of the original Friday the 13th & Friday the 13th Part 2 (1981) being condensed into about twenty five minutes with Pamela Voorhees death, Jason worshipping her decapitated head, teen being killed off & Jason wearing a potato sack over his head with an eye cut out just like in Friday the 13th Part 2 but then unfortunately the film takes it's own direction & introduces some faceless teen character's who wander around in the dark a lot & a few get killed off by Jason. The second half of the film is rather lethargic & a little bit dull, none of the kills are very inventive or imaginative & while I did get a bit of a shiver when Jason first donned his iconic Hockey mask & stared at himself in the dusty broken mirror I was rather unmoved by the whole affair. I can't say it's a terrible film but I did expect a bit more, a lot of questions are left unanswered like when does Pamela Voorhees refer to Jason as being dead when he wasn't, how come he has been able to kill people at will for so long & I didn't like the idea of giving him a lair either. The ending is pretty much a direct lift from the original Friday the 13th. This new Friday the 13th offers nothing new when later entries in the original series like Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday (1993) & Jason X (2001) had fun with the concept & tried to do something different like taking Jason into outer space.This new Friday the 13th certainly looks nice, I watched it on Blu-ray & while there are scenes which are just too dark it does look nice & has a lush textured feel to it. The gore is rather disappointing, a few dead bodies are seen, there's a quick slit throat, people are stabbed, someones gets an axe in his back, someone is impaled, someones gets a spike rammed into their throat, someones gets an arrow through his head ^ someones gets a poker stuck through his eye but there's not that much blood & it's more quick flashes than prolonged gore. The special effects are good & the use of CGI computer effects are kept to a minimum. There's also a surprising amount of nudity & sex. The title 'Friday the 13th' doesn't appear on screen until the twenty fourth minute which means this has one of the longest (if not the longest) pre-credits sequence ever, Friday the 13th Part 2 had a pre-credits sequence that lasted almost fifteen minutes.With a supposed budget of about $16,000,000 this took almost $45,000,000 in it's opening weekend in the US alone making it the most successful Friday the 13th film ever & the most successful horror remake beating previous record holder The Grudge (2004). Filmed in Texas. The acting is alright by a cast clearly chosen for their looks rather than their acting ability.Friday the 13th is an alright remake of a classic horror film, I didn't hate it but I didn't love it & apart from the Jason character himself there's not much to distinguish this from the teen slasher crowd. As far as slashers go I actually prefer the My Bloody Valentine (2009) remake.",Friday the 13th
20,dbborroughs,"Almost works as a restart to the series, but there is a lack of passion that sinks it",5,24 February 2009,"Restart/continuation of the series about Jason and Camp Crystal Lake.I don't know what more to say.Part of the problem is that the film keeps resetting. After an opening show down between Jason's mother and a camper the film resets to a group of kids looking for some weed hidden somewhere in the woods near Crystal Lake. After those kids are dispatched we get the title and the film resets again.and we follow the brother of one of the last bunch of kids who is looking for his sister as well as a group of campers who are fodder for Jason.. Its more three mini movies then one complete whole (or four if you count the brother and the camper as separate groups), then again it makes clear that the only one that matters is Jason (who's gotcha appearance at the end keeps the series going but is so illogical as to elicit a groan) .Actually this is a well made, (mostly) well acted retread of a well worn and tired series. In a weird sort of way I kind of like the film (other than the last bunch of campers), certainly I wish it had a bit more passion. I normally hate mad slasher movies but this kind of sort of works. Certainly it feels like an exploitation film from the early 80's when the series started, which is a big plus. The problem is that the film is oddly passionless, the director seems not to have taken the last step to really make this and truly compelling. Frankly the film is damn close to being a viable restart to the series that its a shame it just doesn't work.Worth a look but I doubt you need to pay big screen cash for it.",Friday the 13th

Just a short time after Amanda (America Olivo ) gets us all excited, she flames out leaving us frustrated and wanting more.Things happen fast and furious from that point, and we realize that the movie hasn't really started as we are zapped six weeks into the future. Five people are gone, presumably dead, and we have a whole new group.We don't know what happened to Whitney (Amanda Righetti), and now her brother Clay (Jared Padalecki) is looking for her.Another throat slashed as the rag comes off and the hockey mask goes on.What is it with great breast and a quick death? Chelsea (Willa Ford) goes water-skiing topless and Jason (Derek Mears) lets her know what he thinks.We now know that he has been keeping Whitney alive for some reason. She has to watch him haul in the dead bodies.Trent (Travis Van Winkle) and Bree (Julianna Guill) are getting it on big time, You know she will be next. The only thing that can save her is the fact that there are two minorities present. Don't they always go first? Oh, Yes, Jason really showed some stuff with Lawrence (Arlen Escarpeta).I watched Friday the 13th for two reasons. I'm guessing by now that I am going to be cheated out of one.If you are looking for a good slasher movie and you are not hung up on the title, Friday the 13th is good.Perfect ending!",Friday the 13th
22,zardoz-13,A Cut Below Average for a Jason Movie,4,17 February 2009,"Jason is back with a murderous vengeance in ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" remake director Marcus Nispel's ""Friday the 13th"" (** out of ****), and he doesn't aim to please. This invincible villain with his attitude toward pre-marital sex has changed. Essentially, the new ""Friday the 13th"" synthesizes Sean S. Cunningham's above-average original along with Steve Minor's first and second gratuitous sequels to deliver the maximum amount of mayhem. Nevertheless, despite its slick, ultra-polished production values, nudity, and carnage, this ""Friday"" lacks a shred of creativity. Clearly, nobody expected anything fresh from the new ""Friday the 13th,"" but Nispel's remake shows more interest in Jason than Jason's truly demented mother. Gorehounds weaned on the ""Saw"" sagas will gripe about the lack of brutality. Everybody else will feel like they've suffered through a nightmare in a hospital emergency room. Prudes will carp about the soft-core porno scenes and the voyeurism that panders to its lusty teenage audience. Bluntly, ""Friday the 13th"" generates no suspense, but does a number on your eardrums.The original ""Friday the 13th"" dealt with a mom gone amok over the drowning death of her son while teenage counselors who were supposed to be watching him indulged in sex. Mrs. Voorhees vented her rage and cut a swathe with a machete through those amorously distracted teenagers. Indeed, Jason appeared only at the last moment in Cunningham's 1980 original and he was only a boy. Incidentally, the first ""Friday the 13th"" helped launch the slasher genre a couple of years of John Carpenter's mildly bloody ""Halloween."" Mind you, Jason didn't don the hockey mask that provided him with more personality than any other slasher stalker until the second sequel, ""Friday the 13th in 3-D (1982) and by that time his immortality was taken for granted. After all, Jason is basically supernatural. He has more lives than a cat. He's been frozen, blasted into outer space, and consigned to Hell with few ill effects. A mute, inexorable, slaughter machine with the mentality of a battery powered hare, Jason is Death personified. The new Jason, however, takes on some of the characteristicsnot surprisinglyof Leatherface from the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" franchise. Jason operates in and around Camp Crystal Lake, where he drowned as a youth, like a cunning Viet Cong guerrilla, living in a maze of tunnels with booby-traps galore. Boasting his usual god-like omnipotence, he is tall, dark, and deadly. You never know where he is going to strike and where his weapon of choice will penetrate you.The problem with the new ""Friday"" is Nispel disposes of Mrs. Voorhees in the first few moments without giving the dame her due. The Damian Shannon & Mark Swift screenplay doesn't take place in Camp Crystal Lake, and nobody is trying to refurnish the old campgrounds. Instead, the latest lambs for Jason's machete are a half-dozen, college-aged hikers searching for marihuana growing wild on Jason's stomping grounds. This subplot recalls the Leonardo DiCaprio movie ""The Beach"" where college kids swarmed into a pot field and died at the hands of machine-gun armed natives! Of course, these kids don't have a clue that they're trespassing on Jason's bailiwick. Our deformed killer dispatches them with extreme prejudice in the first 30 minutes. In a throwback to an earlier Jason sequel, he bundles a babe into a sleeping bag and smokes her to death over a fire. Unmistakably, Nispel is paying homage to Jason bashing a girl trapped in a sleeping bag against a tree in ""Friday the 13th Part VIIThe New Blood"" (1988).In a departure from the norm, Jason takes one of these girls, Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti of ""Role Models""), hostage because she reminds him of mom. He keeps her chained up in his subterranean lair. Later, to her credit, Whitney parlays her resemblance to Mrs. Voorhees to her advantage. Whitney's motorcycle riding brother, Clay (Jared Padelecki of TV's ""Supernatural""), is scouring Camp Crystal Lake for her and handing out missing posters. Clay is reminiscent of Rob in ""Friday the 13th Part IV: Jason Lives"" (1986) who wanted to kill Jason for slaughtering his sister. Anyway, Clay encounters a group of obnoxious twentysomethings hanging out at a cabin on Crystal Lake. These kids look like they stepped out of a WB soap opera. They are pretty, but bland, except for Asian-American Aaron Yoo of ""Nick and Nora's Infinite Playlist"" who provides some comic relief. Eventually, Clay finds Whitney, but by then Jason has appropriated his hockey mask, whittled down virtually nondescript nitwits, and bears down on the hero and heroine. Nispel generates his scares with sudden bursts of deafening music timed with occur with Jason's sudden appearances. Everything is rather dull when Jason isn't slashing and gashing his victims. ""Pathfinder"" lenser Daniel Pearl's atmospheric photography creates a modicum of mood. Incredibly, Nispel doesn't take full advantage of Harry Manfredini's memorable ""ch-ch-ch/pa-pa"" music. Comparatively, Nispel's unsubtle remake makes Sean S. Cunningham's original slasher look Shakespearean.",Friday the 13th
23,Boba_Fett1138,Nothing too special.,6,16 February 2009,"Well, first of all I've never fully seen the 1980 original, only it's last 45 minutes or so and that was quite some time ago. Therefore I can't really comment on how this movie compares to the original and how faithful it is to it, though from what I can judge this movie pretty much is a movie on its own, with a different approach of the story and the character of Jason Voorhees.More and more classic horror movie are getting a remake these days. Only a handful did this successfully, while most of them remain too much of the same. ""Friday the 13th"" is also more of the same. It's a generic modern horror flick/slasher, that features a bunch of teenagers who love to have sex, drink alcohol and take drugs and a manic killer that is on a killing spree.Most disappointing thing about this movie is not necessarily the fact that it's being so generic, it's more that it has almost no story present in it. The movie is basically the one killing after the other but without ever becoming tense or surprising. You basically know in advance who is going to die when and who will be the next one. With a little bit more (background) story the movie would had been at least a more interesting one to watch and it would perhaps also had helped to make the characters more interesting. The movie seems too random. People are getting killed for no apparent reason and you are just waiting for the next one to die, since there is not much else to this movie. You know that the only reason why this movie has so many characters is because it allows the movie to have as much gruesome killings as possible in it.It's not really a movie that is being effective with its scare moments, also because of the reason that it's all quite predictable and formulaic. It tries to compensate this with its gore but the most hardened horror fan shall not be too impressed by it all. As a modern horror movie it really isn't the best the genre has to offer.The movie shows far too much of Jason Voorhees. Because of this his character also doesn't ever get scary enough, despite a good beginning. He's shown fully in far too many sequences and after a while the character won't do a lot to you anymore. It's also part of the reason why the movie isn't being too effective with its horror and scare moments. Sure, it has a good atmosphere still, provided by director Marcus Nispel, who already showed with his previous projects that he could handle dark themes but style over substance is never a good thing when it comes down to movie making.It's definitely not the worst modern genre movie or remake but I wish it had a bit more story and originality to it. It will probably still spawn a couple of more sequels though, also considering the huge success this movie is already currently being in it's opening week at the box office. Let's hope they will learn from the mistakes of this movie when they come up with a sequel in the upcoming years.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Friday the 13th

You know, there's complex and then there's just nonsensical), diminishing their vocabulary to two expletives and the word ""no""(from the otherwise dreadful dialog where they try to sound hip and elicit no emotion for these characters other than hatred... I can't say which is worse, really), and slaughters them in a brutal, at times effective, and seldom creative ways. There is tension and suspense in this(and it definitely does surprise you sometimes), and we get some stalking. The attacks tend to ""work""; there's hand-held camera and quick cutting in them, and sometimes, you can't tell what's happening. This is 96 minutes sans credits, and if you can stand it, you can do worse. It's grittier than the others. Acting is poor. It isn't torture porn, at least, though it could still be far better. This is never funny, and the partying gets to be nauseating. Honestly, so does the non-stop bashing of Republicans, and I'm about as Liberal as they come. There is a lot of nudity, sexuality, blood, violence and gore in this. The Extended Cut DVD comes with a few reasonably done featurettes, one that is 22 minutes long entitled ""7 Best Kills""(I beg to differ on that), the 11 minute Hacking Back/Slashing Forward(some of the cast have *no idea* what they're talking about, and clearly think *way* too highly of themselves and their knowledge on what they're interviewed about), the 11 minute The Rebirth of Jason Voorhees(which I will review on its own page here on the site), and 8 minutes of cool enough alternate scenes.

26,view_and_review,Thanks for Nothing,2,25 July 2021,"""Friday the 13th"" is yet another reboot nobody asked for. I knew it would be rank, but I do pay HBO $10/mo or whatever so I may as well watch it. F13 was clearly trying to stay true to the slasher roots: Crystal Lake, young coeds, sex, and drugs. I was looking for skinny dipping, but the closest they would come to that was topless wake boarding. There were subtle updates such as cell phones (which didn't work) and GPS, but nothing notable.By now you know the story of Jason Voorhees, played by Derek Mears. For years he was played by Kane Hodder. He's the hockey mask wearing, machete wielding super murderer who terrorizes Crystal Lake. He's back to terrorize the place again.F13 went about the way you would guess; there were annoying characters, dumb moves, a lot of killing, and the predictable survivor. One particularly annoying character was Jenna. She was your Mary Sue. She was also such a good judge of character she went traipsing with Clay after just meeting him. I can't say she was anymore annoying than the rest of the characters, she just stood out.F13 made an attempt at a plot. Clay (Jared Padalecki, most notably from ""Supernatural"") was looking for his missing sister Whitney (Amanda Righetti) near Camp Crystal Lake while at the same time a group of seven was staying at an expensive cabin. The point is they were all within Jason's territory so they were all fair game.Anyway, 13 dead, which is pitifully low for Jason. Thanks for nothing.",Friday the 13th
27,anaconda-40658,Friday Again?,3,6 May 2015,"Friday the 13th (2009): Dir: Marcus Nispel / Cast: Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Aaron Yoo, Willa Ford, Travis Van Winkle: Day of superstition becomes a pointlessly graphic slasher film remake that seems to reference the first three parts of the original saga. Jason wears a sack over his head (as in part 2) before donning the now famous hockey mask, which he originally obtained in part 3 in the original series. Asides from that he basically slaughters a bunch of airhead teenagers. Directed by Marcus Nispel with a similar image of the original film only much worse. These films were never grand scale quality but this remake seems only interested in presenting a numbing body count that eventually turns this into a real yawner. When screenwriters must resort to a body count to gain an audience then they are basically losing all faith in one's ability to be scared, and gearing towards one's sickening desire for torture. The cast includes the likes of Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Aaron Yoo, Travis Van Winkle, and Willa Ford who bring no life to the morons lined up to be on Jason's killing spree. The production seems to be one course, but who cares. While the original film was nothing to write home about, it is golden alongside this gory piece of crap. This pointless and stupid spectacle proves that the series has long run its course. Now it's time to put it to death like its victims. Score: 3 / 10",Friday the 13th
28,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Highly impressive and enjoyable remake,9,28 October 2015,"Looking for his missing sister, a young man joins a group of friends partying at Crystal Lake where they realize their actions have brought the attention of masked madman Jason Voorhees living in the area and slaughtering the group forcing them to fend him off.This was one of the more enjoyable and entertaining efforts in the series. About the only thing really wrong here is that the opening was a massive mistake as to waste twenty-five minutes of time here with them since the first are only body count kills and doesn't sit too well. Considering we've only got slightly more than a hour left to go in the film, with the main part of the film being the second set of campers and there's no way that should've lasted as long as it did which cheapens the impact of the second group coming up. This could've easily been trimmed down and that gives them more screen-time to avoid becoming the stereotypical drunken teenagers they are that populate the original series. The other flaw here is the out-of-character move where Jason kidnaps the one which serves no real purpose other than to get the brother involved and this whole part was massively flawed and really didn't do anything. Thankfully the rest of it was utterly awesome with a lot to really like here. Despite the story-line problems, the opening attack is incredibly fun and full of action with three big stalking scenes, some brutal kills and several solid suspenseful moments that serve as an amazing intro. Other fine stalking scenes, from the couple out on the speed-boat at the lake, the initial spying scene that brings them to the full realization of what's going on seeing him maneuver the dead body around the abandoned camp, and the fine ambushes on the several friends who go into the shed outside which come off rather fun. The house attack is also rather fun as the closed-off location and darkened lightning makes for an eerie feel, the extra bodies piling up at the right moment and the panic leads to them falling victim to several of his set-ups resulting in some more deaths and making for a greater time here as lead-in to the high-energy stakes in the rather frantic, action-packed series of chasing is incredibly fun. As well, there's the really fun and enjoyable final battle here in the tunnel where there's some really fun battling between Jason and the lone survivor, some brutal brawling that's vicious and intense while also getting in some decent suspense and action here from the rather fine stalking throughout in the creepy tunnels in his lair. Along with a fantastic-looking Jason that's really intimidating at times and copious, well-supplied nudity, there's a lot to really like here.Rated R: Extreme Graphic Language, Nudity, Graphic Violence, several strong sex scenes and rampant drug use.",Friday the 13th
29,FlashCallahan,The Wood Wizard.....,8,18 January 2012,"Wade, Ritchie, Amanda, Mike and Whitney travel to Crystal Lake to camp, but Wade and Ritchie have found a plantation of weed and intend to raise some money selling the dope.However, the group is brutally attacked by Jason Voorhees.Six weeks later, Clay is seeking out his sister Whitney in Crystal Lake, distributing a missing poster with her picture to the locals.In a gas station, he stumbles into the arrogant Trent that has invited his friends Jenna, Lawrence, Chewie, Nolan, Chelsea and Bree to spend the weekend in the cottage of his wealthy family.Jenna teams up with Clay in his quest and they discover that Jason is killing her friends....I cannot see the problem that some people have with this movie. First of all, it isn't technically a re-make, or else it would follow the first movie (hence the title), it's a re-imagining, or some other sort of word, and it references (very heavily though) a few of the past films.So if you can get over the fact that Jason can run, kidnap, or do other things he never did before, you will find a really good standalone movie. I can really understand that it's someones favourite antihero but Nispel (the Uwe Boll of remakes) has made his best film here, and has given us some really unlikable teens ripe for the kill.The best thing about this movie is the opening, as it sets the narrative for the main story nicely. Performances from the cast are good, but I doubt we will be seeing a few of them on the a-list anytime soon.But the editing and cinematography is the best thing here, particularly when we see Jasons POV when he begins to stalk the house.It's a reboot of a much loved horror franchise, but Bay and Nispel have done a great job, and it shows in the numbers.Not everyone was going to like, but there are some who do, but won't admit it.Go on, I dare you...",Friday the 13th
30,Aaron1375,In the end a fairly good update of the Friday the 13th series.,7,18 February 2009,"Yes, this movie is basically a reboot of the Friday the 13th movies and a new start for Jason as he finally has a chance to be alive in a movie for the first time since Friday the 13th part IV. This one kind of blends in the first three movies of the series into one adding the marvel the cell phone and a few other new innovations to bring the series into this new age. Granted, at one point we had the typical no one has a signal scene which is becoming a standard in today's horror films. So we basically get group of people go camping and get killed off, another group is later shown going to a house in the same area and a dude who is looking for his sister from the first group is hunting for clues. As expected you have Jason killing people in different ways though the machete is weapon of choice. You get a good bit of killing, a Jason with really fast reflexes, and some boobs to look at. However, this remake just is not up to other recent horror remakes such as Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween. They did stuff to really up the ante. Texas ramped up the gore and tension and Halloween gave you some good back story scenes with Michael as a child. This one really does nothing new as the only thing different is Jason new found speed. In the end it is nothing more than just another updated Friday the 13th. Granted to me that made it still enjoyable for what it was as it was nice to see Jason in a gimmick free environment again. Let's face it they paired him with Freddy, shot him into space, made him a body snatcher, sent him to the big apple, made him battle a telepath, and brought him back from the dead so it was nice to see him as just a retarded deformed big dude out for revenge for his mom. So expect some jump moments and some yuck moments as this movie may not be anything new or special, but it still is a pretty good slasher movie.",Friday the 13th
31,Wuchakk,"Scarier and with a more dangerous Jason, but not as fun",7,24 July 2014,"I became a fan of the ""Friday the 13th"" series after seeing ""Part V: A New Beginning"" (1985) on TV in the late 90s and have subsequently digested all of the films in the series. This '09 reboot takes elements of the first four films, drops all campy elements seen in Part III (and V, VI, IX & X) and provides better scares with a more dangerous Jason, who runs, shoots arrows, uses traps and schemes. In the original series Jason was comparable to an unstoppable zombie-like force, particularly as the series progressed where Jason became more & more infernal and monstrous. Here he's more human, which makes sense since it's early in the timeline and Jason hasn't yet morphed into the hellish zombie he became in later segments.The appeal of the series for is not the gore or kills but rather the plot of a group of youths gathering in the wilderness; the inclusion of a psycho killer on the loose adds a necessary element of threat & suspense, and Jason's a quality nemesis/monster. Simply put, ""Friday the 13th"" is an entertaining series with creepy elements, but I never found the flicks all that scary, not even the first two films, which are the most serious in tone, along with IV, VII, VIII and XI. Of course there are jump-scares galore, but that's not what I'm talking about. With the third installment, campiness was added, which made several of the installments even less scary. The good thing about this '09 reboot is that it throws out the campy aspects and opts for a more serious approach. In addition, it has a couple of sequences that produce actual frights, something I never experienced with the rest of the series, as well as scenes with genuine suspense, like when Jason chases the three protagonists through the tunnels, etc.Speaking of the three protagonists, the cast is filled with youthful no-names, but the three main protagonists, a brother & sister and a brunette who takes a liking to the brother, are good and likable. It's always nice to have some people you can root for. Really, there are only two characters who are unlikable, a creepy redneck hick (and his ""hot"" mannequin, lol) and the arrogant alpha-male whose father owns the vacation house.I found one aspect of the film highly unusual and unique. I'm referring to the 24-minute prologue before the opening credits. This has to be one of the longest prologues in film history. I have to give credit to the filmmakers for being creative and trying something different.This reboot also just plain LOOKS better than all those older films; I'm referring mostly to the creepy woods at night. This is to be expected, of course, with the advancements in filming technology since 1980, not to mention the bigger budget.The series is known for its excellent assortment of women in every entry, but this one's not quite as good as most of the films in the franchise. There's the excellent Amanda (America Olivo) in the first act and also Whitney (Amanda Righetti) and Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) as the two female protagonists. They're solid, but not in the same league as Pam in Part V, Agent Marcus in Part IX and Heather in Part XI (FvJ). I suppose it's all a matter of taste though.The film was shot in the heart of Texas, mainly in regions relatively near Austin.FINAL WORD: My biggest criteria for judging the worth of a film is whether or not it pulls me in and makes me forget about the passing of time. This '09 reboot succeeds in this respect. Although nothing can replace the initial 1980 film and its immediate sequel, this reboot should be given credit for generating a few genuine scares, which I rarely if ever experienced with the rest of the series; not to mention providing a worthy trio of protagonists, as well as scenes with genuine momentum.Other than these factors, the reboot is just more of the same, but it's at least as good as the better sequels, although it's not as fun as several of them because it shoots for serious horror. This is good, but the first half is more effective than the second. And it fails to approach the greatness of the '09 remake of ""The Last House on the Left,"" a veritable masterpiece that transcends the usual one-dimensional nature of most slasher flicks, not that I would expect (or necessarily want) that for ""Friday the 13th.""I have the ""Killer Cut"" that runs 105 minutes, while the theatrical version runs 97 minutes. Needless to say, this is a heavy R-rated picture.GRADE: B",Friday the 13th
32,The_Void,Bunch of suits cashing in on popular eighties horror,3,1 September 2009,"Hollywood's remake machine still droning on, and eighties semi-classic Friday the 13th is the latest film to get the unwelcome treatment. I can't say I'm a massive fan of the Friday the 13th series; certainly it's one of the better slasher film examples, but that's not saying much in a niche so lacking in good films. However, compared to this remake; the original Friday the 13th is like Ferrari compared to Ford, it's Led Zeppelin to the Spice Girls; Mario Bava to Michael Bay. To say this update is poor would be a gross understatement. The plot is, of course, just your basic slasher fare. The scene is set at Camp Crystal Lake; where a bunch of kids have travelled to camp in the woods and steal some of the local weed that grows wild in the area. It's not long before there's a discussion about the legend of Jason Voorhees, and shortly thereafter all the kids are butchered. A while later, someone named Clay sets off on his motorbike to look for his sister (who was one of the kids from the start) and he meets some other kids who are there to be slaughtered.The film is a remake of Friday the 13th, but effectively it's a mish-mash of ideas from the first few films of the series. The plot involving Jason's mother is briefly skipped over in the first few minutes as the producers knew they couldn't market a movie without Jason Voorhees in it. There's also a scenario where Jason finds a hockey mask and puts it on, which feels completely out of place. Obviously the producers knew Jason had to wear the mask so they could put it on the posters, but it would have been less silly if he was just wearing it from the start. None of the characters are interesting at all, and only one is memorable. I don't remember his name but he's the one doing a Tom Cruise impression. Director Marcus Nispel (who did quite well with the TCM remake) expertly captures the modern horror MTv music video style, and this basically glosses over any attempt the film makes to be shocking/scary. There's some gore but it doesn't make any impact. There's also some RIDICULOUS idea about Jason taking a prisoner, which was obviously put in the movie to dampen it and ensure that it got the 'R' rating, which helps the producers to make more money. Overall, this is an absolutely abysmal effort that does no justice to the original and was clearly made to cash in. Luckily, it didn't cost me anything to see (but I still want my money back!)",Friday the 13th
33,zetes,One of the better Friday the 13th movies,7,15 February 2009,"I don't think anyone was particularly angry about this ""remake"". Every Friday the 13th is pretty much a remake of Halloween anyway. One of them just takes place in space, that's all. So, yeah, you pretty much know what to expect here. Sexy teens (who totally deserve to die) stumble upon abandoned Camp Crystal Lake, where they discover that there's a hulking mongoloid with a machete hanging around. Jason has changed a little. He's a little more human, less zombie. He can walk at normal speeds and even run. He's smarter - perhaps too smart. I think that'll be the biggest complaint from fans. Jason sets traps, shoots arrows and utilizes fire in this one. It didn't bother me much, and I thought this was one of the better entries into the series. It's decently tense, and well made (despite the image sometimes moving too fast and being unclear). The chicks are hot, and they have, as one male character points out at one point, ""perfect nipple placement"". The kills are nasty and mostly pretty inventive. There are definitely a couple I think'll be fan favorites. Jason's a little too attached to his machete.",Friday the 13th
34,trashgang,It failed due the lack of a storyline,6,4 March 2009,"The best opening weekend for a horrorflick ever, that's what the papers say about this remake. So the desire to see it was beyond limits. Watched the Fangoria about the movie and read the interview with Derek Mears about letting other projects down just to get involved in this remake. Last year I've seen and talked to Mears, a nice person always a big laugh and preparing to laugh when pictures were taken. I have mine together with Mears and Andrew Bryniarski leatherface in the TCM remakes. Also a nice guy. Two years ago I had a picture taken with the Jason machete against my throat, guess who had it in his hands, yes, Kane Hodder, he played Jason the most. He didn't say a thing, never looked up and never smiled, a weird guy.Anyway, Sean S. Cunningham (directed the original one and produced the remake) was also involved, hmmm, looks great. Michael Bay was also involved, wellknown as producer for the remakes of Amityville and the TCM remakes, hmmm, excellent.When the first reviews popped up I always noticed that they were about the tits of the girls and not about Jason, that didn't look that good, so I didn't know what to expect.The flick starts off in 1980 were Jason's mom was decapitated, like in the original. When they go years later with new kids going to Crystal Lake the movie really starts. Well, indeed, the storyline isn't that nice after all, I was never that scared or impressed by the effects, the movie is surely gory and explicit in all ways but something is missing. The best part is when Jason found his hockeymask. all killings reminded me of the original Friday's, the arrow, the sliced head. The problem is that it isn't really a remake, they wrote their own storyline with the guy searching his lost sister. The first part of the flick is okay, then you will have something like, being there, seen it, done. The ending is a typical Friday ending. Luckely Mears gives a great performance as Jason. remakes mostly don't work, except for the Halloween version. And this year is the year of the remakes, and they hope franchises. My Bloody Valentine, Hellraiser (worried about that one because Doug Bradley wouldn't appear as pinhead and they would like to make a new face, argghhh) and rumours about The Thing too. Watch this remake, you will have your red stuff flowing but don't expect it to be a gem.",Friday the 13th
35,mm-39,Not bad but not great either.,6,17 February 2009,"Friday the 13th is not a bad movie, but not a great movie either. Friday the 13th is just an OK movie. The beginning of the film is strong and scary. The first 3rd of the movie is interesting with Sam Winchester off supernatural looking for his sister. The character just acts like Sam would from the Supernatural series. Then, the viewer loses interest when the story becomes bogged down with character development. I read once they make the characters annoying in the Fridaday 13th series because if the audience become to attached to the characters the audience gets to disturbing watching the film. There where some scares, and tension with the movie. However, I have seen a few of the other 13th movie and a few of the scene in the new movie become predictable. The movie was worth going to I would give Friday the 13th a six out of ten, or a 7 out of 13. I would call this movie a rental or cheap night movie. They still managed to give present film an 80's feel like the older Friday the 13th movies.",Friday the 13th
36,HumanoidOfFlesh,Watchable remake of sub-genre defining camp slasher.,6,24 February 2009,"A shortened introduction sequence efficiently conveys that Pamela Voorhees killed off the camp counselors who neglected her deformed baby Jason that a final girl chopped her head off and that Jason came back.A present day.A group of horny teenagers is hiking through the woods looking for a secret marijuana crop.Of course they stumble onto the camp grounds by mistake,which is where a now adult Jason steps in,gorily dispatching the teens in a glorious fashion within twenty minutes.Several weeks later Clay comes to Crystal Lake looking for his sister,Whitney,one of the teens who disappeared after that prologue.Clay runs into another batch of young people,this time staying at the lakeside cabin owned by one of their parents.Soon the bloodbath ensues as Jason is hiding in the woods...The remake is superior to the original series mostly in technical ways:better editing,better acting,better overall craftsmanship.Unfortunately the film is not as gory as the legendary original.The killings are mostly bland and uninspired and the lack of tension is disappointing.There is a little bit of highly welcomed nudity,but not too much.I expected far more intense slasher and was let down.Still Nispel's remake is watchable,if you have enough time to slash.A generous 6 out of 10.",Friday the 13th

In the 80's many such Fridays came, but its very first is remembered till today. Now on 2009.... The scary scenario is back... Jason Voorhees is back! This time, fortunately with a decent script. Directed by Marcus Nisplel and written by Damian Shannon & Mark Swift 'Friday The 13th' is a good one time watch.The film has its share of sequences that give a chill down your spine, while some are funny rather than being scary. Camp Crystal Lake... ah, I don't wanna go there. The terror of Jason is revived, and hopefully shall close here. This maybe the only fairly decent Jason Voorhees legend to come out in recent times. Performances by the actor: Willa Ford is wasted... though she flashes her sexy body wonderfully. Derek Mears as Jason, does his part well. Jared Padalecki is good. Danielle Panabaker looks pretty and does a decent job. Others are mere gap fillers. on the whole, this Friday is indeed a bit scary.",Friday the 13th
38,StevePulaski,About as New as a 1970s Record,4,4 July 2010,"Think back to the 1980s. Remember when Jason Voorhees was a killer who almost played like a victim. Well, get rid of past knowledge, because were bringing in new knowledge that is trying to rid your old knowledge and replace it with new knowledge. Thats knowledgeable right? If you remember in the classic Jason movies, he had to search for you. But once he found you, you were gone. In this one, he basically is peeping tom and tries to look over element to try and find you.If you haven't noticed. This is a REBOOT of Friday the 13th. It cant be considered much of a remake. If that were the case Pamela (Jason's mom) would be the killer. Though, it doesn't avoid the aspect of taking from another movie in the series. This is basically the second and fourth film in one. So if you have seen both, you not watching the same movie, but bits and pieces of them.Jason has always been and will hopefully remain my favorite slasher in the Horror genre. Michael Myers may have started the slasher formula, but Jason started ""the camping in the woods style"" nostalgia. Which is why he is my favorite slasher. Though after watching this clearly rushed reboot I respect Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" a lot more.The plot, like many other Horror movies, is slim and slender. After his sister goes missing when with her friends, her brother Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) along with other brain dead teenagers go into the woods for a party held by another stuck up teen, Trent (Travis Van Winkle). The gang has various encounters with the hockey mask killer while trying to find Clay's sister, most of them seem cliché and rather boring.The attacks are so recycled to the point where you think your watching something you have already seen. I like a couple of the death scenes, but most feel like a ten year old designed the sequences.I wish they would make a Jason remake that for once had a group of teens that were semi-smart. They don't need to have walked off the set of ""Revenge of the Nerds"", but don't make them leave their ""Detroit Rock City"" shoot to do this. Of course nobody can out smart Jason, but at least let them have enough knowledge to know after a few people are missing, something is up.To be completely honest, I sort of liked it, but it's hard to like a movie with no scare level, no actual effectiveness, a lackluster kill design, and mediocre jump scenes.Starring: Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Aaron Yoo, Amanda Righetti, Travis Van Winkle, and Derek Mears as Jason.

39,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Re-Make, Re-Boot, Re-Vamp, Recycle, Re-Use, can't tell the difference? Well, neither can I!",7,19 June 2009,"Tttch, ttch, ttch, ha, ha, ha Jason Vorhees is back ttch ttch ttch ha ha ha, OK, I'll stop doing that. Well, back in the glorious decade that was known as the 1980's came out a series of slasher films, two of which have stood the test of time and given us Freddy Krueger and Jason Vorhees. The new millennium brought us Freddy vs. Jason, awesome movie, I recommend it, but we still needed a re-boot of the iconic monsters. So we have Friday the 13th, what baffles me is why the title is same of the 1980 film that was a great slumber party movie. This could have been a lot more better if it had worked as a sequel rather than a re-make. Now, don't get me wrong, I felt that this was actually a fun horror movie, the fans get what they want with the blood, gore and sex. But Jason seemed a little off to me, I think he went to rehab or something for his killing addiction, don't know if it was the actor or the director's vision, but this could have been a little bit better.On June 13, 1980, a young Jason Voorhees witnesses his mother being beheaded by a camp counselor who was trying to escape Mrs. Voorhees's murderous rampage around Camp Crystal Lake. 30 years later, a group of vacationing friends arrive at Crystal Lake on a camping trip. As Mike and Whitney explore the abandoned Crystal Lake camp, Jason begins to kill the rest of the group one-by-one. Jason also kills four of the friends, but instead of doing the same to Whitney he decides to kidnap her because she resembles his mother. Six weeks later, Trent, along with his girlfriend Jenna, and their friends Chewie, Chelsea, Nolan, Bree and Lawrence arrive at Trent's summer cabin, which sits on Crystal Lake, unaware of the events that occurred a few weeks prior. Also in town is Clay, who has come to Crystal Lake searching for his sister Whitney. Clay eventually makes his way to Trent's cabin, where Jenna agrees to help him look for his sister on the other side of the lake, much to Trent's dismay who's jealous of Clay. As Clay and Jenna search for clues to Whitney's disappearance, Jason does what he does best baking cookies oh, wait, I got that messed up.With the recent roll up's of remakes like Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween, coming soon Nightmare on Elm Street, is Hollywood literally that much out of ideas? Like I said before, I think this would have worked better as a sequel, because not having the original creators on set makes the film feel like a bunch of frat guys who just thought ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool to make our own Jason movie?"". Sometimes we do have a winner with the remakes like Dawn of the Dead or even Texas Chainsaw Massacre had it's moments as well, unfortunately Friday the 13th didn't do anything to stand out against the other movies. I do recommend it for a night rental, it's always cool to see Jason and how awesome his murders are kudos on the girl in the sleeping bag getting set on fire, what a burn! Ha ha ha ha ha! I made a funny, ha ha ha, eh, uh, I try, give me some credit.7/10",Friday the 13th
40,blanbrn,"A new take and twist on the legendary and iconic Jason that's filled with plenty of skin, blood, and gore.",6,15 February 2009,"Of late in the film business it's became the norm of the remake especially for horror films as over the last few years we've saw reboots and remakes of ""Halloween"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and both were more modern each updated it's time frame and both showed plenty of blood, gore, and skin. I must say much the same about the new remake of ""Friday the 13th"". The character of ""Jason"" has became a pop culture icon over the last 30 years as a kid I loved watching the Friday films for a good scare.This 2009 edition isn't in my opinion as good as the old and traditional 1980 original, yet still this new remake was pretty well done with plenty of teen sex, gore and blood. It stays true to form as again a group of horny teens,(by the way none of the actors or actresses I've never even heard of) who always think about screwing, and smoking pot take a summer journey into Camp Crystal Lake. And as expected this lake has hidden secrets from many years ago. One by one each teen in typical Friday fashion starts to meet their bloody and gory end from the masked hockey man known only as Jason.Overall this 2009 edition is well worth a watch for any fan of the old film series, even though as expected in a 2009 edition sex, nudity, drugs, and much blood and gore became the norm still this 2009 edition is worth a watch for any horror film fan buff.",Friday the 13th

Jason.",3,13 February 2009,"2009's 'Friday the 13th' probably ranks 4th or further down the reboot list, past 'Dawn of the Dead,' 'Halloween' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre.' Funny, it is from the maker(s) of 'Chainsaw.' I can see why. This is almost a reboot of both the 'Fridays' as it is the new 'Chainsaw;' they were so similar, I can easily envision a 'Leatherface Vs. Jason.' They seem to be in the same realm, same townsfolk and same backwoods/ward mindless killers. What I liked was the new and fierce Jason: Fast, smart at times, totally vicious and in a small way realistic  the films shows a lot of the ways he gets around and how he hunts, sometimes by simply turning on the lights. They even go as far as to explain how he gets the juice to maintain electricity in his hideaway resort. I am shocked, however, with the budget they were allotted (surprisingly by both NewLine and Paramount  anyone who knows the legendary departure of Paramount might be surprised to see their return,) the real-life sets and mood, how incredibly bad the rest of the film is. I can appreciate giving the fans on what they wanted: breasts, drugs, sex and oh-so-awful young adults you just wish dead. But, they already did that in 'Freddy Vs. Jason.' At least 'FvJ' had characters with depth, funny lines and a true homage to the screen legends. Why anything original (aside from hyper-Jason) was left out of '09 Friday' was beyond me. Sure, there were some scares, but very little surprises, ripped off scenes from 1-3 and shots that might as well been preluded with ""Exhibit Cliché 1, 2, 3."" Not that this seemed to bother the director/writers: They seemed to know they were bringing nothing new to the table and they simply didn't care.",Friday the 13th
43,bensonmum2,"""Jason. My special, special boy.""",6,16 September 2009,"I've been a fan of Friday the 13th films for about as long as they've been making Friday the 13th films. I don't much care for some of the more recent entries to the series (for example, I loathe both Freddy vs Jason and Jason X), but I've always had a good time with the earlier movies in the series. In fact, one of my favorite movie-going experiences involves the Friday the 13th films. I can fondly remember back in the 80s going to the local drive-in one night in a driving thunderstorm to watch parts 1-4. What fun! So with a bit of apprehension, I finally decided to take the plunge and check out this new re-imaging.So how was it? My rating might not indicate it, but the new Friday the 13th wasn't as bad as I had feared. The movie has its fair share of problems (I'll get to some of the more heinous in a moment), but at least I found most of it entertaining. Good action, some imaginative kill scenes, and a few new ideas that actually worked made the movie worth checking out. And as I've written repeatedly in my movie comments, entertainment is the single biggest factor for me when it comes to rating a movie.But like I said, I had my problems with the movie. I'm not going to go into detail, just a laundry list: the new, smart Jason who apparently is a licensed electrician; the reliance on sudden, very loud music to frighten the audience; the large, lumbering Jason moving with the stealth of a ninja (Are we really supposed to believe he climbed on the roof of that house in seconds with no one inside hearing anything?); the really underwhelming scene where Jason discovers the iconic hockey mask; the absence of the normal, recognizable Friday the 13th music; characters that are actually more annoying than any in the original films (I couldn't wait to see a couple die); Jason taking prisoners; the finale where the two survivors inexplicably drag Jason's body to the boat dock and throw it into the lake; technical aspects like the overuse of shaky cam and the underuse of lighting; the abysmal acting (Jared Padalecki being the exception); and the scene where Jason hangs the girl in the sleeping bag over the fire and roasts her alive is totally out of character with . . . well, totally out of character with the character.I could go on and on listing things in the movie that bothered me, but really, what's the point. Friday the 13th is what it is, a reasonably entertaining piece of junk cinema that was never meant to test anyone's intelligence.

So I was very interested in seeing this new ""remake"" as they called it. The film is not a remake, I mean yes it touches on some of the history and recreates some of the scenes in particular with Jason's Mom but this is really nothing more than Part 12 of Jason and his terror. There is a recipe that makes these movies successful and the film makers of this installment nailed it home. It is exactly what fans love in the Friday the 13th movies!! Ultimately they did everything right. First of all they didn't PG-13 the film down which most movies do nowadays. The over the top gore is in place, the gratuitous nudity is rampant, and the simple story is in tact. Now I have nothing against some good old fashion nudity in a slasher flick but I will say I think they overdid it. It seemed like every five minutes there was nudity everywhere. It was just overwhelming. Still it's a lot of fun...not the nudity but the movie...well the nudity too.Jared Padalecki is a great addition to the film. He is an excellent hero and could really become a staple to the series if they spin off from this one. He can hold his own and really does a great job. Danielle Panabaker is also good as Jenna. She's not quite as strong as Padalecki but she does a good job as the main scream queen. I would have liked to have seen her character stronger. Derek Mears is terrific as the brooding killer Jason Voorhees. Some might say that it doesn't take a lot to play a slashing mute killer but I think it requires a great amount of talent. I hope he continued to play Jason in future installments. The supporting cast all fit their roles respectively. No one really stands out in the supporting cast but they all make fun, amusing victims for Jason to weed out including the first group he chops through before the opening credits even roll.As a horror franchise Friday the 13th has prided itself on silly characters, nudity, bad teenagers and gory original deaths and they don't stray from that recipe in this latest go around. The deaths are still shocking and gory and almost funny in a twisted morbid way. They will leave your jaw dropping. Director Marcus Nispel doesn't really have experience in the genre per se but he seems to have a good handle on exactly what fans will want to see. I still argue against this being called a reboot, or a remake or anything more than simply another sequel. Sure they try to recap Jason's origins and don't bother to touch on any of the details that happened in any of the films from 2-11 (I'm including Freddy vs Jason) but that doesn't make it a remake. The film is modern day and has it's own story and doesn't recreate any new lore for the character. None of this is a bad thing but don't go into it thinking you're seeing a new vision like that of Rob Zombie's questionable Halloween remake. Obviously this isn't a fantastic piece of cinema but if you love slasher films like I do and love the Friday the 13th series thus far you won't be disappointed for a minute!! 8.5/10",Friday the 13th
45,MLDinTN,a lackluster remake,4,21 December 2009,"I was disappointed in this remake. At least they did try to get a little creative by involving a lake house instead of only having Jason at Camp Crystal. Who knew Jason could leave the campground. The main disappointment was the killings weren't that good for a slasher flick. There wasn't a whole lot of blood and what killings they did show were quick. There wasn't much detail. Also, Jason does not take prisoners, so he would never have kept Whitney alive. It's not right for some remake to completely rewrite the rules of a classic killer. Also, this movie had quite a bit more T&A than most of the 13th sequels. It was clearly pandering to 15 year old boys.FINAL VERDICT: If you are going to redo a classic about a serial killer, at least have new innovative ways to kill of the teens. The killings just weren't that good and not enough gore. I only recommend this if you want to watch a movie with friends that is so bad, it's actually funny and you can have fun laughing at it.",Friday the 13th
46,Cineanalyst,Stereotypical Slasher,3,13 August 2021,"I almost bailed on this ""Friday the 13th"" reboot during its awful opening credits scene, which cuts the white-on-black text of the credits between a reworking of Pamela Voorhees's demise and with the stupid, seizure-inducing stroboscopic effects and scoring added to tediously punctuate it all. And, I probably should've, but it was the 13th of the month and a Friday, so....I hold no warm nostalgia for the first ""Friday the 13th"" (1980) and haven't as of yet bothered with the rest of the franchise, so this movie could do no wrong in respecting or not the series' legacy, or whatever, to my mind. The 1980 film is a ""Halloween"" (1978) knockoff with a reverse-""Psycho"" (1960) twist. By contrast, John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" is a treatise on Hitchcockian voyeurism. These ""Friday the 13th"" flicks are mere hack-jobs. They're what give the slasher subgenre a bad reputation.Back to the beginning of this one, though--it's a rather odd triptych setup. It somewhat reminds me of the opening of ""Scream 4"" (2011) in that way, but duller, longer and without the meta humor. But, there's blood and bosoms. If that's all you want from a movie--a bunch of bleeding, bosomy nitwits shrieking and fleeing, then have at it; this is your movie. Especially so if you can look past the female objectification (one of them even controls a camcorder at one point and somehow still doesn't control the decidedly-male gaze) and that an African-American and an Asian-American characters are included only to be stereotyped with their first three lines: two race jokes by the black guy and a sexually-deficient one for, ugh, ""Chewie.""There's no reason to punish the youngsters for drugs and sex here, either. Without any thought put into the role of the camera and the position of the spectator as in ""Psycho"" or ""Halloween,"" it's but a strangely hypocritical puritanical stance. Pure exploitation, but absent the knowing irony (never mind the necessity to avoid censors) that raises something such as ""Reefer Madness"" (1936) above this. And, yes, ""Reefer Madness"" is better than ""Friday the 13th,"" and you're wrong if you think otherwise.Jason is an utter non-entity, a mere jump-scare figure who looks a bit reminiscent of ""The Toxic Avenger"" (1984). No psychosexual origins are established, nor relationship with the camera, as with Michael Myers originally. Echoes of Norman Bates-type mommy issues are for naught. Big whoop if he runs this time around, or there's a subterranean lair, and who cares where he got his stupid hockey mask. And why would someone dump a corpse in a lake if they don't have something to hide? There's no cinematic value here.",Friday the 13th
47,cricketbat,Better than many of the original movies,6,30 October 2020,"I'm conflicted about this remake of Friday the 13th. On one hand, it's better than most of the original films. On the other, much of this movie's appeal comes from the foundation the franchise already built. However, in the end it's still just a series of stock characters getting killed off one-by-one by a silent killer. It's still got a few good frights that will keep horror fans entertained, though.",Friday the 13th
48,lesleyharris30,"A Straight Up Remake that is Literally Nothing Special,",3,23 October 2015,"Friday the 13th is a brutal film with a poorly developed storyline and a very mediocre cast. In fairness, it's effects are impressive and the movie looks quite beautiful, but that's about it, it's a remake that was simply only made for money, not to bring fans a fun and new experience to the Friday the 13th franchise, it's a modernised version of the original, nothing more. The cast is terrible, everyone plays a typical horror movie character, who's scared of the killer and is trying to do whatever they can to escape, the only actor in this who had any potential was Jonathan Sadowski, he actually tried to make Wade an interesting and unique character, he stood out, but sadly he's only in it for about ten minutes, but they're the best few minutes of the entire movie. As far as horrors go, it's boring, all the deaths are predictable, all the jumps scares are predictable, the ""shocking moment"" at the end won't give you any bit of a fright if you've already seen the original, this movie was made for a bit of cash, it's simple as that, they don't care what people say about them, they got what they wanted, the fans are displeased but they got payed, and that's all that matters to the selfish people who decided to reboot a beloved franchise just because they could. There is literally nothing interesting or enjoyable about Friday the 13th, it's a poor horror and I couldn't recommend it to anyone. Jason hunts a group of carefree teens as they search for a missing girl. Best Performance: Jonathan Sadowski Worst Performance: Danielle Panabaker",Friday the 13th
49,CuriosityKilledShawn,"A very, very poor film but more of Jason Voorhees is always a good thing",6,12 April 2009,"I was wise enough to not get my hopes up. The Friday the 13th films have always fluctuated in quality, but aside from Part V they have always delivered the goods in either meagre or generous amounts.Platinum Dunes' restart is utterly determined to gives us the best Jason possible, and it's evident that they tried their best. But the collective best of Michael Bay, Marcus Nispel, Damian Shannon, Mark Swift, and composer Steve Jablonsky (music has always played an important part of this franchise) just isn't good enough.The characters are flat, boring, and lifeless cardboards cut-outs. A mistake that most slasher films make is giving us horrible, nasty characters that we WANT to see killed (turning the killer into a sort of anti-hero in the process) rather than characters we like. There is no excitement or horror in counting down the minutes until the stock jerk boyfriend gets eviscerated. There is also a shocking dearth of common sense or logic to their actions. I understand that the extended version of the film may fill in some blanks and fill out their reasoning somewhat, but I still cannot side with characters who make stupid, stupid decisions and just don't use their head.I appreciate the fact that they shot the film in anamorphic Panavision (something that is sadly dying out a world of cheap, ugly Super35) but the high key, polished, and shiny photography doesn't seem to fit. Take a look at Part IV. It wasn't the best entry in the series, but the grainy as hell photography created an undeniably bleak, depressing atmosphere and gave the film a unique kind of intensity that is missing here.Jablonsky's score is nothing more than the same noise he gave us with every single one of his previous movies. If the man has any kind of musical talent he's yet to convince me of it. Yes, it works, but only on an extremely basic level. But blasting us with a sudden storm of noise as Jason appears on screen is a dated 'stinger' scare and is void of sophistication. I know that complexity is not something one should be looking for in a Jason movie, but Harry Manfredini's Herrmann-esquire scores for parts I-VI were far superior.The actors do their best with the weak script, so I can't really fault them. The low body count also disappoints. Was it really necessary to specifically give us thirteen kills? It doesn't give the film any kind of clever or ironic edge, if anything it just saves on the blood and gore effects.Since 1980 we've had twelve Jason movies (counting his brief appearance in the first), so did we really need yet ANOTHER slow, stalk and slash entry set at Camp Crystal Lake? Jason has been to New York, Hell, and outer space. Why, oh why, go back to the same old, same old? This film should have given us something new, but did absolutely did not. Why don't people from the town realize that so many victims are splattered right on their doorstep? How did little Jason come to fend for himself in the woods? Is he EVER going to go on a gung-ho rampage through the streets? Hiding in the trees while the music whispers CH CH CH AH AH AH is old, old, old, and I am sick and tired of it.Apparently Shannon and Swift are working on the script for the sequel as we speak. Get it right this time, guys. There's a reason why this film sank like brick after it's first week. You promised something new but gave us something embarrassingly ancient. The audience stayed away once word of mouth got around that you took advantage of their trusting nature.Having said all that, I will always invest my time in watching Jason carve 'em up. He deserves a lot better though.BTW, it's not really a reboot. The film still acknowledges the events of the 1980 original while tweaking the continuity a little bit (the Friday the 13th films were never really solid with the timeline anyway). Think of it as just another Jason adventure. Calling it Part XII would have alienated potential viewers, but the simple Friday the 13th doesn't necessarily mean it's a straight-up remake.",Friday the 13th

51,Bored_Dragon,Few awesome minutes scattered through hour and half of boredom,5,26 September 2018,"""Friday the 13th"" from 2009 is not a sequel to the original franchise, nor is it the remake of any of its parts. While remake is a new version of an existing movie that adheres to the original story, a reboot is a film that re-starts an existing franchise in a different way. From the original franchise, this movie takes Jason and the essence of the plot, but it develops the story in a new and different way. The movie is technically much better than the original and does not have the frivolous atmosphere typical of the eighties slasher, but pretends to be a serious horror. And to some extent it succeeds. The fact is that it's scarier than original franchise movies, but it's no less stupid. The positive aspects are better production, good and better-known actors (Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker), striking gore, more beautiful girls and more explicit nudity (Julianna Guill is perfect, both while dancing in clothes and naked in bed), as well as a couple memorable scenes (if you decide not to watch the movie, at least look at 0:47:50), and negative aspects are the story which is, although new, totally unoriginal and boring, and fact that the movie is essentially perfectly redundant, because it does not bring anything new but only tries to drain another dollar from the fans of the original franchise. Someone should make a five-minute video made up of visually good moments from the film, and thereby save us from unnecessary loss of time to watch the entire movie.5/10",Friday the 13th

Of course, the audience feeds them even knowing that they're bad. It's not scary, it's not spooky but it is hilariously funny and as usual it has no direction to follow. There's so many things to say about how bad this was that it's better...I mean, forget it. Too many flaws, cheap acting, a long opening that takes half hour to fail in its task of scaring people away, but instead they showed some sex (doggy-style!), but nothing so great. If the sympathy brought by Jared Padalecki, Aaron Yoo and Danielle Pannabaker helps a little, on the other hand the annoying and ignorant character Trent makes us cheer for Jason kills this guy in the most horrific way. And what's up with Jason before finding the hockey mask, with that thing in his head with no space to see, yet he can kill everybody? How come? What's the point of all this anyway? He kills teens and more teens, of are only trying to have some fun at Crystal Lake simply because mommy told him to do it?

I felt tired and tired again, it is such an unpleasant and pointless experience but I watched the whole thing. But, hey, at least this new Jason Vorhees can run! There are times we really must like this guy because he doesn't speak but he can kill all these people who simply has tasteless jokes, poor lines to say (just read the memorable quotes section here or take a shot watching this thing) and nothing better to do than get stoned, have sex and play dumb things (such as drinking beer from a shoe). Run for your lives, hide under the bed, call 911, you know how this works, Jason will get you in the ending.

55,zkonedog,Another Remake That Falls Flat,3,12 March 2017,"The first few original ""Friday The 13th"" films (before they started milking the cash cow with endless crappy sequels) were some of the scariest fare to ever come out of the horror genre. Building off the success of the original slasher film, ""Halloween"", this franchise created a character (in Jason Voorhees) that actually has an interesting backstory, making him even more terrifying. Those first five or so installments had everything a great horror movie needs: a decent plot line, a little skin, and some ""jump out of your seat"" moments. Plus, and this is not to be underestimated, they had that ""early 80s movie"" feel to them, as the camera work was very simple and the film quality wasn't pristine, only adding to the scare factor.Sadly, though, this remake (directed by Marcus Nispel) fails to hit any of the hallmarks that the originals made famous. Perhaps the failure of Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" remakes should have been a clue, but I guess viewers (once again) had to learn the hard way that some films just don't need to be remade. Basically, there are two ways to undertake these sorts of projects: Either a ""re-make"", which this tries to be, or a ""re-boot"" (like the latest Star Trek), which this film probably should have been but couldn't because of the iconic Jason character.Besides matching the originals in the nudity department (and whether that is a positive feature is debatable!), this new version fails in every other regard. The story is completely ripped off from the original few flicks, there really are no great ""jump moments"" that can hold a candle to those done in the past, and the cinematography is actually too ""clean and tidy""...there's no grittiness to it at all. Not helping matters is the fact that besides Jared Padalecki and Danielle Panabaker, who turn in fine acting performances, the rest of the cast is uninspiring in all their respective roles...nothing more than fodder to be eventually slashed by Jason.Perhaps the biggest downfall of the entire film experience, though, is the fact that the Jason character is such an icon in the horror genre that there really is no way to either make him better or even match the original. Once again, it's kind of like the Halloween remake...people don't dress up to trick or treat like Zombie's Michael Myers. Instead, they are wearing the old William Shatner mold from the originals. The same concept can be applied to Jason...he terrified us with the tied bag over the head (and then the hockey mask) at first, so why would the exact same thing two decades later be any better?Thus, about the only good thing I see coming from this film is the possibility that it may ""inspire"" a new audience to discover the great originals. However, it will more than likely drive potential fans away due to all its shortcomings.",Friday the 13th

The number is gigantic, considering that the franchise never had a single spark of quality. This time, the franchise tried to return to its origins, to the old abandoned camp on the shores of Crystal Lake, probably in an attempt to remake the first film. Despite being considerably better than the first film and any other film in the franchise, it's still not really a good movie. It creates good environment and suspense but, in fact, we already know everything that will happen, the material is totally worn. The bet on adolescent nudity, deplorable attempts to make sex scenes and drunkenness, make the film immediately obnoxious and prevents any sympathy for those creatures called ""teenagers"".

58,Fella_shibby,Good thriller but pls dont mix Jason n Leatherface.,8,22 May 2020,"First saw this on a dvd which I own almost a decade back. Revisited it recently.
This film did a nice job of straight away jumpin to the creation of the character of Jason n jus taking the ending of the original first part n introducing the scene where Jason as a kid sees his mother's decapitation.
The ominous settings, the direction n cinematography all looked similar to TCM 2003 remake n in a very good way. Enjoyed both these films.
Marcus Nispel did a terrific job with both these films.
But Jason shouldn't be reduced to another killer who takes hostages, piles up dead bodies in his lair n behave like a sophisticated killer with all those floodlights n secrets tunnels n all.This film has some good tension, lots of kills with Jason chasing the victims rather than the zombie style walking n not jus appearing outta nowhere.
It has lots of body count, a sense of dread n the hottie America Olivo's nude scene. It also has lots of stupendous assets on display n a very lengthy n steamy sex scene.
But the funny n bad part is all the locals were living happily unharmed by Jason until the youngsters showed up.
In the olden installments we saw that Jason is a good knife thrower, a knockout puncher, etc but here we get to see he is a good archer too.
And unlike the olden days where Jason gives a rats *ss about bodies n evidence, this Jason makes sure that the bodies r disposed off.
In one scene Jason goes back to his lair with the hostage girl who managed to escape n then he suddenly comes back to the tool shed, so fast? Mayb to get rid off the body but so fast?

He makes this remake and throws MANY enigmatic situations that will be explained in a ""Beginning"" movie. Read my words. But meanwhile we have plenty of Jason Voorhees material to dig on and enjoy.After watching it on it's premiere, I was very angry and heated (not because of the steamy sex scene involving Bree), No, I had a hot head mainly because of the now infamous and ridiculous ""one-liner"" at the ending (think about ""The Ring 2"", ugh.)After a second, more objective view I can say that this remake stands alone and worths the watch for ANY die hard Friday the 13th fans and Horror fans in general who are into the new way of Horror film making.The fact that Bay and Nispel team-up makes you think that they would use the same formula that made a huge success (grizzly cinematography, torture, and a violent maniac). They did use them with the typical ""Friday the 13th"" elements such as teens having plenty of sex, smoke lots of weed, and getting drunk. Take my word fellow Friday the 13th die hard fans, you can feel safe because we will get the F13Th elements we love combined with a dark, eerie atmosphere, and a more clever, and violent Jason. If you dig the ""Saw"" and ""TCM"" 2000's efforts you know what you can expect.I REALLY dug the character addition for the series. Although in part IV there's a character that is hunting Jason in revenge for his sister's death, he's not important for the movie. In the remake, Clay is the perfect lead male character who is not hunting for Jason, instead he's given a good guy attitude while looking for his missing sister who was probably killed by Jason. This is a new kind of hero in the series; most likely to be the new Tommy Jarvis. And Whitney is truly a fresh character for the franchise. Jason kidnaps and locks her in a dungeon type setting because she resembles his dead mother. Nice! It's like the 30's ""muse inspiring"" for the monster.From part 1 we have homages to Pamela Voorhees doing the killings and getting decapitated by the final counselor girl. Also, we have the Camp Crystal Lake setting, the glorious ""Ki ki ki ma ma ma"", the arrow through the head (it was through the neck in the original), an ax murder (it was an ax to the head in the original), and machete action in teenager's heads, and OF COURSE the infamous ""was it a nightmare?"" ending.From part 2 we have Jason wearing the sack, his dirty shack, the psychology ""fight"" between Jason and Whitney (Ginny in part 2), the campfire legend being told, Jason crashing into the window to grab Clay (it happened in the bogus ending from part 2), and Jason getting hurt in the leg.From part 3 we have Jason getting the hockey mask (thank you! glorious moment), Jason getting violently hanged from a rope and breaking his neck, and the glorious moment when he stretches his arms seeking for help (almost made me cry!) as when he was hit with an ax in the head by Chris at the ending. Of course Lawrence, the black guy is an homage to Ali because he gives Jason a hard time and even hurts him. He's the tough one that confronts Jason without getting scared and decides to go help ""his boy"" as Ali did in part III when he finds Loco's dead body. Also, Jason's disfigured face is similar to his monster-excited grin face from part III.From part 4 we have the duo of jerk funny guys (Jimbo and Ted) now being Lawrence and Chewie, Jason crashing a window in order to grab Clay (it happened when he grabs Tommy near the ending of part 4), Jason's surprised reaction when he gets his sack off (like when he has his hockey mask removed by a machete hit), Jason inclining his head when he hears his name, Jason's black finger nails, his violent reactions, and his fierce running.From part V. Reggie the Reckless' girl scream! Just wait for Trent's bitch scream.From part VI; when Jason puts on his mask.From part VII. Jason's heavy breathing and his love for an ax.From part VIII. Black guy who gives a hard time to Jason.This remake shows the ""human"" side of Jason plus it mentions the relationship with his dead mother. When I write violent, don't think about the most violent 80's Friday the 13th film, yes, The New Chapter. This new wave of violence displayed on Horror movies is very different. Now we have torture, long and painful death sequences (Not all of them), and gore in the likes of the TCM remake.The technical values are pretty solid. The cinematography is excellent for this kind of movie. The score is raw but good with an almost absence of music. The gore is very good although I expected more of Savini-like gore. Still it worked very well. Talking about gore, the deaths are extremely good. Expect machete in the face, ax in the chest and back (ouch!), a female getting burned, butcher knife used, an arrow to the skull, knife into the eye, strangling, and more. Thanks holy violence! The editing is very good and sorry for being redundant, but the dark atmosphere plays very well through the movie.The sex? Willa's eatable breasts getting exposed while water-surfing, and Juilianna Guil's steamy sex scene where we get to enjoy her stupendous breasts and her beautiful ass. Also, America Olivo is taken from behind and looks extremely sexy in all of her scenes.",Friday the 13th

61,Anonymous_Maxine,Jason Voorhees Still Mad About His Mom - 'Friday the 13th' Review...,7,25 February 2009,"There comes a time in every overly long horror movie franchise when it's no longer necessary to add numbers at the end of the titles of the horizonless stream of sequels. This happened in the Friday the 13th series for the first time in part 4, The Final Chapter, which incidentally is also the first time they put a bald-faced lie right into the title. Then the numbering system disappeared until part VI (one of the only sequels worth watching), VII, and VIII, after which the whole titling process changed completely. In fact, no Friday the 13th movie has had ""Friday the 13th"" anywhere in the title since the stupendously bad Jason Takes Manhattan, which was released a full two decades ago.Now, the newest entry in the series is released with exactly the same title as the original! I don't really want to contemplate what this means as far as the end of the series, if it will ever come. I tend to doubt it.Thankfully, the movie was a lot better than I expected. It would be something of an understatement to say that I had low expectations to begin with, but in the cinematic world of horror sequels, the new Friday the 13th is one of the better ones.The movie opens with a scene that shows little promise for a good horror movie. Anyone who has ever seen pretty much any Friday the 13th sequel will be immediately dismayed to see that they have elected to start this one off with the same thing - a bunch of idiot college kids wandering into the forest to get high and get laid, laughing and joking over a campfire about the legend of Jason Voorhees.""It all happened right here in these woods! Right here where we are! Jason could be right behind those trees! Huh huh huh huh!!!""Morons.This is, however, all part of a set-up that sets the stage for the rest of the movie, which thankfully takes a slightly different tact from the myriad of sequels that came before it. There's an opening sequence that's more than 20 minutes long that takes place before the opening title card, and then during the rest of the movie there's a college-age kid surveying all the people in the surrounding area of Camp Crystal Lake to find out if anyone has seen his missing sister, who was one of the kids in the beginning of the movie.Okay, maybe I lied. That's the only thing that's different. There is an unmistakable feeling that the only thing that ever changes in Friday the 13th movies is the kind of cars the kids drive and their accommodations. This time they're cruising along in an Escalade and staying in the vacation home of one of their parents. Evidently someone thought to buy a beautiful lakeside cabin at Crystal Lake, which until now never really struck me as a big vacation destination.The performances are uniformly bad throughout. They are exactly the same sophomoric idiots that star in every horror movie ever made that has high school or college kids in it. They show up making the same stupid jokes, wearing the same stupid halter tops and each representing the same stupid caricatures. The geek, the black kid, the jock(s), the nervous good girl, the hot chick(s), etc. But at least the paper thin characters make the admittedly clever and gruesome kills that much more satisfying. Kind of makes me wonder what a slasher film would be like if there was a single character in it that we cared about, you know?Friday the 13th follows exactly the same formula that the series has followed who knows how many times before - a group of kids go into the woods together and manage to get separated from each other within usually less than ten minutes - but as Jason gets on in age (by my calculations he should be somewhere in his early 60s by now) he has gotten bigger and faster and stronger. This doesn't speak well for the logistical consistency of the series, but when has logic ever applied?The Friday the 13th movies have always been the kind of movies that you watch at home on a late rainy night, usually best enjoyed with a bunch of friends and a 12-pack. I can't remember a time when a Friday the 13th movie has ever been scary, but I would be lying if I said I don't occasionally get a huge kick out of having a couple beers with my buddies and watching an old, bad horror movie, so what's so wrong with having a couple beers with my buddies and watching a new, bad horror movie?Note: At one point in the movie, one of the characters says this line of dialogue - ""Let's all be one big, happy cliché!"" I don't think I even need to comment on that.",Friday the 13th
62,videorama-759-859391,One done fun Friday plus JG,4,19 March 2014,"The Friday 13th movies of the 80's were the weakest succession of movies ever, even surpassing the Police Academy movies. As in every Friday 13th movie, everyone has to die, to make room for the next unsuspecting batch of young things, unaware of the horrid fate that awaits them. As here, there's a different angle of plot I did like, where a surviving girl of the first batch of teens, who are slaughtered within the first twenty minutes in some inventive and stylish ways, is keep prisoner by the infamous, Jason. Honestly I liked this part the best. It's very rewardingly entertaining as done with some real surprising and original humour. Two of the guys stumble across yes, a little marijuana plantation, what in the vicinity of the infamous and respected murder spot, Crystal Lake. Yes. There's that campfire tale of the legendary Vorhees, one tells to the rest of the group, where you know what follows. What you don't expect, it actually takes twenty minutes for the title of the flick to come up on the screen, after these teens are done for, where the revelation of the spared victim, doesn't come till much later. I was disappointed that this group got shortly killed off, where I expected these victims, to be Jason's picked off victim's for the whole. I found these guys more likable and human, than the next arrogant and hotter group of teens that enter the picture, although their are a couple of benefits for the viewer from these clowns. Watching Julianna Guill get her gear off, exposing strawberry bra which lies behind, are mammoth breasts, that would keep me in milk supply for a month is the highpoint scene of the whole affair. One stray guy comes snooping around, looking for his missing sister... yeah add up the dots, clashing a couple of times with the lead stud of the group, Trent, who's a real ars..le. Again, as are the times, the violence is more extreme, though not consistent, but is eye popping and contently approving from the gore hounds eyes. But in the end, all this film boils down to is another rehashing that is the thing now, with these remakes of more intense horror flicks of the eighties, where 2006's Hills Have Eyes set the tone. Panned reviews from critics of these flicks, like Halloween, is expected. God forbid they should make another whole series of Friday the 13th's. Perish that scary and tiring thought. Okay, may'be just a sequel. But here with this one, in the year of Swine flu, I was very much entertained, more than I thought I'd be. Humour played a big part of that too.",Friday the 13th

Soon, her brother, Clay (Padelecki) desperately searches for her and meets Jenna (Panabaker) who is staying with her friends at Crystal Lake. Jenna helps Clay and Jason begins hunting her friends.

64,GOWBTW,Rebirthing a classic slasher!,8,23 February 2009,"Anyone who loves Friday The 13th can rest assured. Jason Voorhees(Derek Mears) is on the prowl. Unlike the first one in 1980, this movie focus on Jason himself. There's plenty of everything that makes a good slasher movie. The oversexed couples, the alcohol, and the party planning. The only thing that can ruin the fun is a homicidal killer who hacks, slashes, and maims his way to oblivion. There are certain scenes you wouldn't find during the 80's version of FT13TH. Like for instance, topless water-skiing, that is a first for the remake. Though I remember the guy saying not to use the boat, well the guys who did ended up dead. And how did Jason know when to find the girl that hid from him? And this version of the movie became a little more diverse? Well, what can I say? The killing never stops in Camp Crystal Lake. Just as bloody as the others in the 80's, you can't go wrong with Friday the 13th. I can one about it: I SMELL A SEQUEL! 3 Out of 5 stars. Enjoy the originals as well.",Friday the 13th
65,jtindahouse,Balance not quite right,8,12 February 2009,"Friday the 13th has an incredibly powerful first 15-20 minutes. It really kicks off with a bang. Jason is back better than ever. Then something goes fractionally wrong and we fall back into old territory. Everything becomes a bit too familiar. Still, it does better than most horror films in the sense that it really doesn't become too tedious until the last 10 minutes or so.The main characters are strong in their performance without being memorable. The cameos are the real scene stealers including a gas station attendant and a man named Donnie. A lot of the jokes from all concerned really hit the mark though and are a nice touch to the film.The Friday the 13th remake is what it is and at the end of the day probably all that could realistically have been hoped for. It won't decrease the seemingly ever growing hate of remakes, but it certainly won't add to it either and that in itself is an achievement.",Friday the 13th

Some smart producer decided...Hey let's re-boot the franchise with a new original. Bad idea. We are treated to not one but two prologues before the main title pops up.First there is a flashback to 1980 where Jason's mother loses her head over the lone survivor of the first massacre. Fast forward 30 years or so (Where the hell was Jason during those years?) when a group of five campers sets up camp near, you guessed it, Camp Crystal Lake. Apparently they are there to reap a crop of marijuana growing wild and re-sell it and become rich. A couple out for a stroll comes upon the abandoned Camp Crystal Lake. Meanwhile good ole Jason appears at the camp site and begins ""machetieng"" the othe three campers. The others return and are also attacked. Whitney Miller (Amanda Righetti) is spared because she apparently resembles a picture of Jason's dear departed mother found in a locket at the old camp.Fast forward another six weeks where Whitney's brother Clay (Jared Padalecki) is out on his motorcycle in search of his missing sister. He meets up with yey another group of unwary campers on their way to the luxurious cottage of the rich kid in the Cadillac Escalade. Clay is showing a missing person poster of his sister to people in the area. One unfortunate soul, a garage mechanic or such becomes Jason's first victim this time around.Clay unwittingly calls at the cottage where he is thrown out by the spoiled rich kid. One of the girls takes pity on him and befriends him. While they are out walking in the woods, they come upon Camp Crystal Lake and get creeped out all the while that Whitney imprisoned below cries out unheard. Back at the cottage, Jason begins paring down the cottagers one by one in his usual grisly manner. One poor soul gets an axe thrown into his back before being hacked up by Jason. Soon all are dead.Clay stumbles upon Jason's underground lair and finds his sister. In trying to escape, they are confronted by Jason and...................................................This movie ignores the events of the Jason sequels for the most part and dismisses the thirty years since the 1980 massacre. No explanation given. Jason is still as brutal and dim witted as ever. The final scene sets up yey another sequel to which I say.....arrrrrgh!",Friday the 13th
67,DarkVulcan29,Rob Zombie did it better with Halloween.,2,16 February 2009,"I mean really, Rob Zombie put more creativity into Halloween, he made the characters interesting. Rob Zombie went beyond the original, and made it enjoyable.It is too bad he was not asked to direct this would be remake of Friday The 13TH, it was anything but original, okay it deserves some credit for having somewhat of a storyline, but then it soon becomes the predictable premise you all know it too be. Jason Voorhies, the hockey masked killer, who is best known for muttering the infamous words, ""KILL KILL, KAH KAH"". Going around killing drug addled, horny twenty something year old. Although it does pay homage to the original 1980 film at the beginning. But after a while the whole premise got lost along the way. It's proof that horror has lost its originality.",Friday the 13th
68,generationofswine,An Honest Review,1,8 November 2016,"It wasn't entirely bad. I mean Jason was an icon so....wait...this isn't exactly the best way to start.What to expect from a Friday the 13th movie: 1) Female nudity. We can check this one off the list, the re-make certainly had that.2) Teens or rather young-adults murdered. Hmmm, this is iffy, the cast felt more like actual adults and not the young fresh out of high school crowd. Still, they were murdered.And, really, this time the cast was actually pretty good. It didn't have the B-Movie actor feel to it.3) a silent killer that never runs and can catch you anyway. Yup, we had that too.So what went wrong? How did the re-make not come up to snuff? Honestly, I blame the budget on this one. I blame the quality.When you sat down to watch almost any of the original Jason movies you knew you were watching a cheap horror movie with pretty cheap acting--sorry Kevin Bacon. You got the guilty pleasure feel to it. You knew that you were watching a film that only had two main selling points, nudity and gore.You sit down and watch the remake and it feels like you are actually watching a real movie. It doesn't have the cheap feel that, in the case of these slasher movies was sort of enduring.The Exorcist was a real movie, I loved it just like many other people, but it's not on my Halloween list. It's not one of the movies you go to when you want to binge on slasher movies. You want something...cheaper.The remake hit all the tropes that made the original ones so loved, or rather so watched. But, it did it with a real budget and that took away the feel of the film.The acting was good, not cheesy.You don't want to watch a real movie when you buy a ticket to see a slasher film. You don't want to see anything with an actual budget behind it.You want a cheap guilty pleasure and that is exactly where this movie failed. Sam Winchester is too good, too well known to make it into a film like this. It needed a cast of nobodies that can hardly act. The sets need to look kind of cheap and not so well done.Ultimately the failure of Friday the 13th the remake is that it tried too hard to be a decent and good movie.",Friday the 13th
69,jadavix,Michael Bay walks out of a movie he produced. Blatant objectification: good. Simulated sex and/or nudity: bad.,4,17 April 2019,"This ""reboot"" of the Friday the 13th franchise was very successful, and yet, inexplicably hasn't produced any sequels. Does that have something to do with Michael Bay's walking out of the screening of his own movie (he co-produced)? Maybe he was so repulsed by the sex that he nixed any further installments.Bay has made a career out of showing young women dressed and lit for maximum, ridiculous, tacky sex appeal - who look like women that only exist in the wet dreams of a 13 year old boy. BUT! He absolutely draws the line at showing them simulating sex or baring their breasts. That's a bridge too far for old Mikey!What the hell is up with that?The movie does have some Michael Bay-esque touches. It looks like it was cast entirely from a Levi's catalogue. The cast are all improbably handsome, so much so that it's really quite ridiculous. You can't take anything you see on screen seriously, and you certainly can't empathise with this picture perfect mannequins come to life.It was only in the film's closing moments that I got an idea of the broad archetypes SOME of the characters were supposed to inhabit: that is, one of the Steve Stunning types was an obnoxious rich jerk, and his babin' girlfriend was the brainless one putting out for his money (which probably makes her smarter than all the other characters, but whatever).Of course, there's also the token black guy. What was he doing in the movie? it was made in 2009, not 1994. How many groups of white people have one black friend, and one Asian friend, and all go on holiday together? And the black guy only exists in the movie to make standard black-snowflake-jokes, the new millennium's equivalent of ebonics.The only character who made any impression was an Asian guy, perhaps because you don't expect an Asian guy to be in this movie, and the character seems to have a legitimate personality aside from the clichés the other characters are perhaps supposed to inhabit (they're so sketchily drawn you can't tell what they're supposed to be).The movie has some alright kills in it. Mostly, I was just waiting for it to end.",Friday the 13th
70,dee.reid,"You're a mean one, Mr. Voorhees...",6,23 January 2011,"Like most people, I don't normally go for remakes or reboots, or whatever you want to call modern re-tellings of classic film stories. ""Friday the 13th,"" a remake/reboot/loose sequel to the classic 1980 slasher flick ""Friday the 13th,"" is one remake that I find to be better than the original, or at least more enjoyable than the original.I don't particularly care for the 1980 original, because as I've written twice before, I don't particularly care for Jason Voorhees as a slasher movie villain/anti-hero. I personally think he's the most boring slasher ever (alongside Michael Myers from ""Halloween""), and I didn't care much for ""Friday the 13th""; I save the best praises for its superior 1981 sequel, ""Friday the 13th, Part 2."" ""Part 2,"" of course, is the official debut of Jason Voorhees as the killer (the killer in the original was his disgruntled mother Mrs. Pamela Voorhees).Director Marcus Nispel (who was also behind the camera of the semi-decent 2003 remake ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") makes his 2009 update ""Friday the 13th"" a combination of the first four ""Friday the 13th"" titles from the original series - an attempt to combine the best elements of those three features into one in an effort to give a 2009 audience what they want from the past. This feature is a mean and bloody one, and I enjoyed it a lot better than I did the 1980 original. That says a lot coming from me, considering the mixed feelings I have toward this series.The film begins at the now-infamous Camp Crystal Lake in 1980 (a sort-of recap of the original ""Friday the 13th""), where a young woman decapitates Jason Voorhees's mother Pamela right in front of him, after she brutally stalked and murdered the other camp counselors because she believed they were responsible for her son's accidental drowning. 29 years later, a group of five young campers have unwisely arrived in the area looking for a hidden crop of marijuana. One of them relates to the others the story of Mrs. Voorhees's bloody rampage nearly 30 years earlier, and the fate of her young son Jason. Alas, the legend proves true and all said campers are promptly slaughtered by a burlap sack-masked, machete-wielding adult Jason Voorhees.Six weeks later, a group of seven college students have arrived in the area for a weekend of booze, bud, beer, and sex (yes, there's lots of gratuitous T + A here, folks). Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) has also arrived looking for his sister, who was also one of the campers believed to have been brutally dispatched by ye old Jason six weeks earlier. As you would know it, these young folks, too, begin to meet the same fate as so many others before them.""Friday the 13th"" has to have set some sort of record for having two separate bloodbaths in one 106-minute film. Really. After the five campers at the beginning of the movie are all slaughtered during the film's first 20 minutes, we then move onto some new blood afterward who are also ready for a date with a machete-wielding Jason Voorhees. The film's opening scenes are its best moments because they are actually pretty intense and are an excellent tribute to the first four films from the original series. And then it moves into more-familiar territory after this initial set-up.None of the characters are particularly well-developed, so it makes it easier for us to watch them get slaughtered one at a time in some pretty gruesome and creative ways. But a pair of stoners are a real stand-out, though they are very well-developed before being killed in some pretty gruesome ways. Also, Jason is seen here much like he was in ""Friday the 13th, Part 2"": he's a brutal killer, yes, much like the one we're all familiar with, but he is also seen as somewhat vulnerable, human, and frail. He's also seen as somewhat of a thinker and not an invincible mindless zombie (like he was in the later sequels from the original series). Yeah, they took the best elements from the first three entries of the original series and rolled them up into one big ball of wax here.Bravo, Jason, bravo. You finally made another movie in which I actually like you in.6/10",Friday the 13th

72,JoeB131,Another unneeded horror remake.,2,21 June 2009,"I think I owe Rob Zombie an apology...As flawed as his remake of Halloween was, at least he TRIED to do something creative with Michael Myers. Not so with the people trying to remake a movie about his cheap knockoff, Jason Vorhees.The remake of Friday the 13th can more accurately be described as a remake of Friday the 13th parts 2 and 3, since they are the movies featuring Jason Vorhees as the killer. (For those who recall, his MOTHER was the killer in the first movie.) The first scene is a remake of the climax of the first film, where Jason's mother (played by Star Trek Alum Nana Visitor, and boy, has she hit the skids!) being decapitated by the surviving counselor at Camp Crystal Lake. A young Jason picks up her locket and remembers her vow to kill anyone who gets in his path.Next we have a scene with five horny kids going into the woods to look for a marijuana stash, because pot growers don't mind you stealing their crop, really! (Why Jason didn't kill the people who actually planted the pot in his camp isn't clear.) Jason kills all but one of them in typically gruesome ways. Wash. Rinse. Repeat.The brother of the surviving girl comes up to look for her, and meets up with some obnoxious college kids at dad's summer house. Apparently, all the locals know about Jason, but Crystal Lake is still a great vacation spot.You can always determine the life-span of people in a movie like this on their likability. The less likable you are the shorter your lifespan. I would point out this is a horrible cliché in horror movies, but the F-13 franchise was largely responsible for creating the cliché, so you can't really fault it for being here.Naturally the Expendable Black Guy and the Nerdy Asian Guy are amongst the first to get whacked. Minorities in these films are ALWAYS the victims, not the survivors/heroes. Now why is that? The production values are pretty high for this film, compared to many of the originals which were barely above Grindhouse quality. But there really isn't anything new or creative here. Jason is the same old Jason, and he became a tired self-parody a long time ago, as ""Jason X"" and ""Freddie vs. Jason"" already proved. So what was the point of remaking him? Now I always try to say something positive about a film,and I will here. Sex was always a big part of a Jason film. In recent years, the MPPA prudes have gotten sex taken out of even R-rated movies, but they don't shy away here.",Friday the 13th
73,drqshadow-reviews,"Dull, Dreary and Off-Target, This Remake Adds Nothing to the Friday Legacy",5,7 November 2016,"It's a bit impressive that the Friday series managed to go so long without a reboot; one of Hollywood's favorite tricks to jump-start a struggling series. Having endured more than its share of such hardships, the Vorhees saga no doubt deserves a fresh look, but this relaunch has no sparkle, no magic. It's just another generic, run-of-the-mill, nothing-special stalker picture with an iconic mask riding aboard the killer's forehead. Throwbacks to the original trilogy abound for careful-eyed viewers, but they serve no purpose beyond a brief flash of memory. Jason himself has evolved a bit, taking on more of a predatory, turf-protecting role rather than that of a mindless, knife-flinging abattoir. His presence is more tenacious and precise, too - less of the lumbering meathead we experienced in previous encounters - but he maintains an odd knack for the comically theatrical, with a special love for body-tossing and delicate corpse arrangement. Of course, his teen victims are as dumb and irritating as ever, though the SFX gore of their eventual demise has been largely withdrawn or relegated to off-camera insinuations. The setting looks great, and it's easily the best-composed Friday ever, but the effort is ultimately rather pointless and empty without adding something new to the mythos. Dull and overly long (even at a mere ninety minutes), this particular jump-start is a clear case of style over substance.",Friday the 13th

76,MBunge,"You kill 16 kids, what do you get? Another day older and deeper in debt.",4,21 January 2011,"Essentially a Cliffs Notes version of the first three Friday the 13th movies, this remake is less of a story and more of a conveyor belt. It hums along, bringing graphic violence and bare boobs to the screen with automated efficiency. It's all so mechanical that you can't feel anything for the killer or his victims, though the young ladies' knockers are impressive enough to rouse some interest.The film starts with a 60 second version of the first Friday the 13th flick, the next 20 minutes is essentially the 2nd film which introduces Jason (Derek Mears) slaughtering a bunch of horny, Ganja-seeking young people and then the movie introduces yet another gaggle of youth for Jason to slaughter for the rest of the flick. That's pretty much it. These filmmakers try to tie it all together by having the brother of one of the first group of doomed kids join up with the second group while searching for his missing sister, but that's about as thin as a dime that's been run over by a train. This movie isn't really anything more than people getting killed and chicks getting naked. Each is done with a certain technical skill, but it's all as dry and lifeless as a shrunken head.The Rob Zombie remakes of Halloween were just awful. I meanoh my goodness, they were just awful. To his credit, though, Zombie did try and do something different with the story. He tried to add things or explore the ideas underlying the films. Now, pretty much all of the things he added were stupid and unwanted and his intellectual explorations were as fumbling as a teenage boy trying to unhook his first bra. But at least he made the effort to make Halloween films that were different in some way than what was made before.There's nothing different about this Friday the 13th remake. Nothing's really been added. Nothing's really been changed. There's no attempt to rethink Jason or Camp Crystal Lake or his victims or how he kills them or anything else. This movie is almost like a primer, teaching the audience the basics of Jason Voorhees and his rampages so that a later film can come along and actually do something interesting with the concept with the viewers already brought up to speed.I do have to give director Marcus Nispel some credit. The outbursts of violence in this film are quite dynamic and well done. However, they're not at all frightening. They're like very brutal action scenes from a Mel Gibson or Sylvester Stallone flick. In fact, the whole film is remarkably unscary. There's a lot of stabbing and screaming but no dread or terror or apprehension about what might come next.I must also salute Julianna Guill for showing off her very impressive rack for an extended period of time. She appears to be a decent actress, given her small and simplistic role as ""hot chick who has sex and gets killed"", but her bosom belongs in the Movie Mammary Hall of Fame.This Friday the 13th isn't a shot-for-shot remake like Gus Van Sant's ill-conceived version of Psycho, but that same spirit of mindless copying is what animates this film. The result is a movie that, while not aggressively terrible, is almost utterly without merit.",Friday the 13th

78,drownnnsoda,"Routine Re-Boot of the First Few ""Friday"" Films Offers Zero Suspense or Surprises.",4,13 February 2009,"""Friday the 13th"" (2009) is a reboot of the first few ""Friday the 13th"" movies, blending elements of each one together into one movie. The film focuses on a group of college kids spending the weekend at one of their rich father's cabin in the woods near Camp Crystal Lake, where thirty years ago Mrs. Voorhees went on a killing spree to avenge her deformed son Jason's death. Turns out Jason didn't die, and he watched his mother get beheaded by the sole survivor of the killings. Now, Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) is searching for his sister who went missing on a camping trip near Crystal Lake, and encounters the group of partying kids, primarily Jenna (Danielle Panabaker), who is the only one willing to help him in his search. But Jason is back, and it's not long before the bodies start to pile up.Much to my dismay, ""Friday the 13th"" '09 suffers from one killer fault that spoils the entire movie - sheer predictability. There is not one single surprise to be had in the 90 minute running time, and the plot is contrived and formulaic to the point that the audience becomes bored from nearly the get-go. The film opens with a lengthy exposition in which a group of teenagers camping in the woods are slaughtered by Jason, and then forwards to six weeks later in which the primary events unfold. The first twenty minutes of the film are entirely done in the ""Friday the 13th"" fashion, which was nice to see, but after that it just went downhill.Our main characters are all extremely unlikable, being made up of cocky, spoiled rich college guys and their blonde female counterparts, all of them spending their screen-time drinking and getting stoned. Aside from them is Jenna, who is the only likable one of the group, but even still, there is little revealed about her so she doesn't seem important to the audience either. The Clay character, an outsider looking for his missing sister, is the only character with any real depth to him, and even then it's quite little. None of the characters have any personality and are nearly impossible to identify with, so it's almost enjoyable seeing what creative and bloody ways Jason will off them. There is no one to root for in this movie, and that displaces the viewer.I know, I know, it's not like the ""Friday the 13th"" movies are masterpieces by any means- but I personally enjoyed the first few films much, much more than I did this remake. And besides, if you're going to create a remake that is a combination of the first few films of the original series, you would think the filmmakers would have at least tried to improve upon the faults of the original series, but they didn't at all. If anything, I find the original films more enjoyable.The original ""Friday the 13th"" is a slasher classic with a good twist and some actual suspense, which this movie also failed with. There was absolutely no tension, no scary moments, or even anything that was slightly inventive. The villain, who is the superhuman Jason, is much different from the original series as well. In this film he seems to have picked up traits eerily similar to the Leatherface villain of the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" films (keep in mind the director of this movie also helmed the 2003 ""Texas Chainsaw"" remake), and his entire demeanor is different. He's no longer mysterious in the least, and there's nothing about him that sets him apart from your typical slasher psycho. He lives in a lair underneath his old home, which is also quite reminiscent of ""Texas Chainsaw"". As for the good points - there aren't a lot. It has some nice cinematography, and the acting is decent for the most part. The homages to the original are few and far between, but they're there (I was however disappointed with the lack of usage of the series trademark ""Ki ki ki ki... ma ma ma ma ma"" sound effect). The elaborate death scenes will also please some gore fans, but a lot of them lack the surprise factor, as does the movie as a whole.Overall, ""Friday the 13th"" is one of the most predictable slasher movies I've seen in a long while. The original film series is no masterpiece, but this reboot was so typical and suspense-free that I was bored from nearly the beginning. And I'm not one who rags on horror remakes just because of the fact that they are remakes. I enjoy a lot of them, but this movie was so average and predictable that it lost my interest. Fans of the original series might enjoy it, or they might not, but I'm suspecting many will be unhappy with it. I left the theater sorely disappointed, and that doesn't happen often with me when it comes to horror movies. 4/10.",Friday the 13th
79,davispittman,Almost....,6,21 March 2015,"This remake of the 1980 slasher Friday the 13th, is OK. The last 30 minute were by far the best. The beginning and middle sorta drug along, I felt like it needed more momentum. Danielle Panabaker was my favorite character, why the heck did she have to die? The 1 human in this film that wasn't a jerk or a 1 dimensional throw away character was killed, if anyone should have lived, it would be her! But anyway, I did love the action sequences in the film. The main character played by Jared Padalecki is nice and I liked him in the role. This film did need to tone down some of the slasher stereotypes, like the exploitation of women, boobs just for the sake of seeing boobs, and overly long sex scenes for no reason. The gore actually wasn't though, which was very surprising to me, given it's a slasher remake. I can't compare it to the original because I haven't seen it, sorry. 6/10",Friday the 13th
80,hu675,"Feels like more of a remake of the 2003 version of ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" than ""Friday the 13th"".",7,12 April 2010,"Years ago...young Jason Voorhees (Caleb Guss) witnessed his psychotic murdering mother (Nana Visitor) got killed by a camp counsellor (Stephanie Rhodes) in Camp Crystal Lake. By local legend, Jason was thought to be dead by drowning but they were wrong. Now Crystal Lake is an abandoned summer camp and the grown-up Jason (Derek Mears) kills anyone, who enters near Crystal Lake.But when an mysterious stranger (Jared Padalecki) is searching for his missing sister (Amanda Righetti), who disappears weeks ago. When his sister travels with her boyfriend and her friends near the camping grounds. A group of college students (Danielle Panabaker, Travis Van Winkle, Aaron Yoo, Julianna Guill, Arlen Escarpeta, Willa Ford & Ryan Hansen) are staying at one of the student's summer house. Which is close to Crystal Lake. An angry, furious and violent Jason decides to stalk and kill these trespassers one by one.Directed by Marcus Nispel (Pathfinder ""2007"", The Texas Chainsaw Massacre ""2003"") made an good-looking, technically well made but an very flawed movie that is also one of the least effective of the ""Friday the 13th"" movies along with ""Friday the 13th Part 7:The New Blood"" and ""Friday the 13th Part 8:Jason Takes Manhatten"". It strikes me the director only has the talents to direct remakes, yes, he does have some visual style. But i would love to see at least, one original film by Nispel.The Blu-ray have an sharp (Intentionally dark looking picture by Cinematographer:Daniel C. Pearl) anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 HD Surround Sound. Cinematographer:Pearl, who is best known for shooting the original ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and the 2003 remake. He gives this 2009 version, the best looking Friday the 13th movie to date although it is one of the least effective. The Blu-ray includes the R-Rated Theatrical Cut and Extended Version with nine minutes of additional footage. I actually prefer ""The Extended Version"" for the added gore and an few moments of character developments in the movie.The Blu-ray also includes an interesting Terror Trivia Track with Picture-In-Picture, Three entertaining featurettes, two alternative scenes, a deleted scene and a digital copy (It's only good until June this year). It would have been nice having an audio commentary track by the director or the screenwriters:Damian Shannon & Mark Swift, who wrote the campy ""Freddy Vs. Jason"". This remake is actually parts taken from the original ""Friday the 13th"" movies. Which is Part 1, Part 2 and Part 3. In some ways, it was probably not the right idea to remake this movie in this fashion.The biggest complain is the screenplay of the movie or it is from the filmmakers. I felt, Jason Voorhees was actually closer to Leatherface's personality at times. Conserding, it was made by the same filmmakers, who remade ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". Also Jason Voorhees would never, never and NEVER would kidnapped someone, even If she looks like his mother! Although the twenty-four minute prologue is good, the sometimes ludicrous sex scenes in the opening sequence ruined the effectiveness. Also almost all the characters in the picture are unlikeable or boring (Expect for Panabaker, Yoo, Righetti and Guill). The sex scene between Guill and Winkle is probably memorable for the wrong reasons and the ending is plain stupid...to say the least. I also thought, there was a little too much sex in a ""Friday the 13th"" movie.The original ""Friday the 13th"" films were much more effective and crude. But the crudeness was more charming in the earlier movies than this new ""Friday the 13th"" version. Overall, I didn't hate this but i didn't love it. Also what's missing, we hear very little of Harry Manfredini's classic music theme. I thought, it was rather strange that the producers:Michael Bay (Bad Boys 1 & 2, Transformers 1 & 2, The Rock) and Sean S. Cunningham (The original ""Friday the 13th"". The New Kids) were not interviewed for this Blu-ray version. I heard that Michael Bay hated this movie and I would have love to hear comments from Producer/ Director:Cunningham. Who always seems to be a simple guy, who just love being involved in making movies of all kinds.If they produced a sequel to this so-so remake, I just hope the sequel is done right and this franchise could go in the right direction. Since ""Platinum Dunes"" productions recently produced the remake of ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"", which it will be released in April 30, 2010. I hope, their upcoming remake is much better than this movie! Panavision. (Both Versions:***/*****).",Friday the 13th
81,JoeKarlosi,Friday the 13th (2009) **1/2,6,15 February 2009,"It's strange for me that even though I am against this modern trend of remaking practically every past horror movie of all time, I didn't really object to this revisit of ""Friday the 13th"". That's because I am a die-hard fan of this series and Jason Voorhees, having joined the cult after seeing PART 2 in the theater in 1981, and then all the others on their premiere night. As much as I enjoy what I suppose will now be referred to as ""the old F13 series"", I think the filmmakers got whatever mileage they could out of it, and it was time for a new start. As far as I am concerned, whatever they called it, this new film was pretty much just going to be ""Friday the 13th: Part 12"" to me. So with my mind wide open I went to the first day screening of this updated redux, and I came out with mixed feelings.We begin in 1980 with a very hasty by-the-numbers poor man's recap of the end of the original ""Friday the 13th"", just to get the ball rolling immediately in defining who Jason is and why he does what he does. Then we forge ahead a couple of decades where a group of typical stereotyped teenagers are partying in the woods of the now-abandoned Camp Crystal Lake. The maniacal Jason -- wearing a white potato sack on his head in homage to the old PART 2 -- sabotages them and ""does his bloody thing"", and all of this before we get to the opening credits. Then more time passes, and we are introduced to a new selection of young thrill seekers, all of them just as over-sexed and interested in smoking pot as the previous group. Naturally they too decide to unwisely settle near Jason's home turf, and it will come as no surprise revelation to inform you that they too become the latest target practice victims for Mr. Voorhees' sadistic revenge fetish. One of the characters is actually the brother of one of the previous young girls who has gone missing, and he's hiking to try and locate her (perhaps a nod to a similar set of circumstances in 1984's THE FINAL CHAPTER).After all is said and done, what things basically come down to for true fans of this franchise is: ""does this F13 deliver the goods?"" I'd say the answer to this is mostly ""yes"". This new version of Jason - who does manage to locate his trademark hockey mask, though in a rather convenient and lazy way - is much more human and calculating than we've seen in the last several sequels. He is a maniacal hunter who sets booby-traps to catch intruders and moves physically quickly when he dispatches them. Jason is now a deadly balls-to-the-wall bad-ass here. There are those excessively gory kill techniques which we've come to love and expect, so the movie satisfies in that regard, even though I didn't think these death scenes were all that unique, with one exception involving an unlucky person under a dock.Jason's intensity and his gruesome murders are the best thing about the film (and I should add that it is highly recommended that fans buy the extended ""Killer Cut"") because the teenagers aren't very likable except for the character of the young man who's searching for his sister. The players in these films have not always been much more than stereotypes anyway, but I felt there still could have been more done with fleshing out these characters here and making us bond with them a little more. On the minus side, like so many newer movies, this one comes across with that dark and grainy brownish hue instead of nice vivid colors. So there are attack scenes which are filmed in the shaky cam mode and sometimes so dark that you have to really strain to be sure what is supposed to be happening.I won't reveal the ending except to say I wasn't crazy about it. On the whole I'd file this entry pretty good and somewhere in the middle in terms of ""best in the series"". But if this makes good money at the box office (as I'm sure it will) we'll no doubt get a whole new string of modernized Jason films. In the 1980s when I was a lot younger I always figured ""the more the merrier"", just as long as we got the hockey masked maniac coming back every year or two. But maybe because I'm close to 50 now, or maybe because I left the theater thinking I'd been here and done this many times already, and maybe because ""F13 '09"" would probably be more exciting to a new generation who hasn't already been through this adventure before, I almost wouldn't mind if there wasn't a sequel. Yet of course, if we get one I'll be there on opening day. **1/2 out of ****",Friday the 13th
82,kairingler,Jason Voorhees,6,8 July 2013,"I was just surprised how this movie got bashed so bad.. now don't get me wrong bashers,, the 1980 version will always be better. but I wanted to see an updated version,, sure you have a lot of the same stuff you had in 1980 drugs sex, all that stuff that attracted Jason to his kills. now what I do like about this version is they do some explaining about certain things that happened to Jason as a child,, there is a scene late in the movie , when the woman says to the Camp Counselor you should have been watching him more closely, granted Jason isn't as scary in this movie as he was back in 1980 but he seems more versatile though. siphoning gas,,, setting traps and snares,, I was impressed with that . all in all it isn't a horrible movie.. I don't think the producers directors intended it to be a remake,, like hey it needed to be re made,, what i'm saying is an updated version.. look folks, this version isn't crap ,not as good as original, but not crap either.",Friday the 13th
83,TdSmth5,Good but lacking for hardcore fans,8,19 February 2009,"The movie starts with some background about Jason's mom and her death. The we move to ""present day"" where five friends are out near Crystal Lake looking for some weed plantation. They eventually camp out in tents. One guy goes out exploring, one couple also goes is out there in the woods and finds Jason's home, and the other couple is going at it in a tent. Then Jason appears and dispatches four of them. This part has the most entertaining characters.Then we are taken ""six weeks later"". A guy, Trent, is looking for his missing sister, one of the girls who went out in the woods six weeks before. Meawhile a group of 7 friends go out to a fancy cabin belonging to one of the guys, a rich arrogant jerk. His girlfriend is with him, two non-descript blondes, a bleached-blonde dude, a black guy, and an Asian guy. The Asian guy is supposed to provide humor, the black guy pretends to be racially sensitive, but is just kidding. They are all heavy drinkers and dopers. Rich guy and his girl run into Trent. The girl sympathizes with him, rich guy hates him. Trent also goes to some old barn where a young hick tries to sell him weed. Jason appears in the barn, kills the hick and finds the hockey mask.Eventually, Jason will start killing the group of friends one buy one. Trent and pretty girl will go out searching for sis and find Jason's lair and in the end also find the missing sister who is shackled. In the end they confront Jason.This movie has a lot of good elements: sex, drugs, lots of killings. The intro with Jason's mom has a lot good scares. The second intro best captures the likable kids-in-peril scenario.The main part however is lacking somehow. None of the characters is interesting. A lot of the movie is shot in the dark, and later in the rain, too. I'm not a fan of rainy night shots. Too overdone in horror. Another problem is how the action, fights, and killings are shot: mainly close up, so it's all indistinct, and blurry. The killings themselves are not very original nor bloody. One of the neat things about Friday the 13th used to be the different ways Jason finds to kill people. Moreover, there is no sense of peril, no extended chase scenes. All the kills are abrupt and over pretty quickly. The atmosphere as a whole is not very scary. This is your typical, efficient Michael Bay remake that's more of an action movie and that doesn't know how get the audience emotionally involved or frightened.Finally, there's Jason, interpreted yet again by a different actor. And this one is one the weakest. He's more dynamic, moves faster, but lacks the presence, menace, and broad shoulders of Kane Hodder or Ken Kirzinger. Jason's wardrobe is also weirder this time around, he wears some type of coat at times making him look like The Matrix's Neo.Overall, a welcome entry in the series, that is not as fulfilling as some of us Jason fans would have hoped. It's a good way to re-start the series and hopefully there will be more and better sequels.",Friday the 13th
84,fertilecelluloid,Entertaining rehash,6,23 February 2009,"Pretty entertaining rehash of the Sean Cunningham original. The set-up is a little different and Jason is a real person from the start. Director Marcus Nispel, who helmed the ""Texas Chainsaw"" remake, doesn't go for hyper-stylization, even though director of photography Daniel Pearl returns as his co-conspirator. A party of twenty-somethings assemble at a buddy's house for a weekend of dope smoking, drinking, and screwing. The problem is, Camp Crystal Lake is nearby, and Jason is having a bad day. When these marginal adults trespass on his property, he starts killing them in gory and brutal fashion. There is an entertaining topless water skiing scene and some well staged dismemberment. The film doesn't feel as graphic as its source because so much blood has flowed under the bridge since then. Biggest letdown is the scene in which Jason springs out of the lake to take down his last victim. If you don't want to do it properly (and better than the original), don't do it at all, Mr. Nispel.",Friday the 13th
85,Jonny_Numb,"Thank God it's ""Friday""",7,4 March 2009,"Hi. I'm the Devil. The Prince of Darkness. Old Scratch. I just wanted to inform you mortals that Hellmy home sweet homehas officially frozen over. You've been predicting it for years, but it's finally happened, for real. How, you ask? Well, it's simple: Platinum Dunes, the company responsible for churning out one uninspired horror remake after another, has finally struck my fancy with something that's, well, GOOD.Granted, ""Friday the 13th"" has never been an inspired property, but has always retained a bizarre appeal in its continuing storyline, its over-the-top kills, and its fascination with young adults who always act contrary to logic and reason (clearly, this was begging for the PD treatment). But it's also odd to watch this remake, nearly 30 years after Jason Voorhees made a split-second appearance at the end of the initial ""Friday the 13th,"" with something resembling reverence for a mass-murdering cultural icon: at the matinée I attended, there were guffaws but also many moments of pin-drop silence in anticipation of the inevitable.Derivative or not, ""Friday 2009"" comes across as surprisingly in sync with its forebears in terms of audience expectation (boobs and bloodshed!) and technique; it's shocking to say that director Marcus Nispel brings a modicum of suspense and, dare I say it, creativity to this franchise rejiggering, which delivers on jolting shocks and scares as much as gore (which, true to previous installments, occurs in potent, split-second flashes). Credit should be given to co-writers Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, who condense the plot points of the initial trilogy into a clever pretitle sequence that revisits the ""rules"" of ""Friday"" (sex, booze, pot, and curiosity killed the kids--yes, it's a little like ""Scream""), before delving into a plot that, while derivative, feels more fresh and original than the franchise really deserves: a Suburban full of college kids on spring break party down at a mansion adjacent to abandoned Camp Crystal Lake; meanwhile, Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) is searching for his missing sister, getting only vague warnings from the small-town populace. While it doesn't take long for our ""heroes"" to start indulging the type of behavior that invites gory death, Nispel paces himself, even taking time to give certain characters a bit of depth and personality; by the tense, nightmarish climax, I was shocked to realize that I actually CARED whether the final survivors made it out alive or not.As for the man himself, Derek Mears capably fills Jason's hockey mask, cutting a properly intimidating figure full of mannerisms both subtle and brutal; it's a fresh start for the slasher icon that favorably recalls the same unspoken depth Tyler Mane brought to Michael Myers in Rob Zombie's underrated reboot of ""Halloween."" While I wouldn't call Nispel's vision as soulful and endearing as Zombie's, he has turned ""Friday 2009"" into an expectation-satisfying, engaging, reverent, and sufficiently bloody exercise in postmodern fear, reaffirming Jason as the type of antihero who won't be kept down.",Friday the 13th
86,aidanratesmovies,"Unoriginal, basic, and all together dull- this film is a nightmare- and not in a good way",4,17 November 2020,"Yet another pointless horror remake, instead of improving on its predecessors, Friday the 13th instead decides to take a trip down memory lane in a dull and often ridiculous fashion. I am not a huge fan of this franchise, I like a few of the Friday the 13th films in total, but still I've never thought of them more as somewhat okay. That being said, its a real shame that with a bigger budget, a new plot, and more modern technological advances, that this film still turned out to be a lifeless corpse of a film. The first 20 minutes of the film are incredibly cliche, stereotypical and pointless. It could have easily been cut out, or at least shortened, but it was put in (i'm sure) to give the film a theatrical length. The rest of the film is somewhat better, but also cliche and stereotypical, with its characters having as much depth as a bag of rocks. The performances, for the most part, are also quite awful. Jared Padalecki does a decent job throughout, but his character can seem rather out of place in the whole scheme of things. The other actors are truly no more than props and hold no importance except for a bigger body count. Some of the kills in the film are also quite ridiculous, and I laughed out loud on several occasions by just how stupid it was. The film has a somewhat decent look throughout, but it's muttled plot and sense of direction forbid it from truly going anywhere with any of it, and its lack of originality doesn't help it any better. In the end, Friday the 13th (2009) was not a total disaster, but it was pointless, stupid, and very unimaginative.My Rating: 3.9/10.",Friday the 13th

88,Samiam3,Amusing remake,7,7 September 2009,"This is Jason Voorhees' 12th appearance, but it is not at all his worst. In someways, Marcus Nispel's remake is as entertaining as the original. To make up for its total lack of suspense and plethora of clichés, the film has a large dose of unintentional humour that always keeps you smiling while the film is rolling and limbs go flying. Once again, Sean Cunningham sits in the producers chair, thinking there are enough fans left to give up their money. Seeing as he no longer takes his work seriously, why should we. However, if you approach this like a black comedy, you won't be disappointed.When it begins, Friday the 13th seems like nothing more than a rehashing of parts II and III. Some of the dialogue may have even been plagiarized. After the intro however, the movie works in some new story material involving a kid looking for his sister who has been missing for six weeks. His search brings him to the woods around Crystal lake where a bunch of friends are having a party at a luxurious lake house. The rest of the story I don't think needs much explanation.As a killer, Jason gets a little more creative this time. Only half his kills are done with the machete, the rest are committed using other more humorous means. A lot of the film is humorous. Whether it is Jason demonstrating archery skills, or one of the kids defending himself with a soup pot, or even a line of dialogue like ""say hi to mommy, in hell"" you may find yourself laughing aloud frequently. The only intelligent thing about a movie like Friday the 13th is that is is a useful film to show in a film class like cinematography 101. This is because in order to be visually evocative, these movies use almost every camera and lighting trick in the book.In the end, I suppose this is a bad movie, but if approached the right way, it's sufficiently fun.",Friday the 13th

This movie tries to make some sort of adrenaline-soaked, lightning fast summary of the first four original ""Friday""'s, but the makers just rush through everything without any sort of creativity or effort. The script is weak and stuffed with all kinds of horrible dialogues (even to the standards of a slasher movie, which aren't high to begin with) and mind-numbingly irritating stereotyped characters (Wade!), but that's not really a problem because well, who really cares about the script of a ""Friday""-film? The main problem however is that director Marcus Nispel (of ""Texas Chainsaw""-remake and some music videos uhm...fame) apparently couldn't film a decent tension scene to save his life. What's with this guy, does he have some sort of disorder that prevents him from filming shots longer than 0.005 seconds? What the hell is going on in this shaky, underlit movie? Wait what, who's getting killed now? Was that Jason, or was it a tree? Screw it, life's too short for all of this. One defining moment I still have to cover though: the dude that walks into a tool shed full of cool weapons...only to get killed with a freaking screwdriver.

91,Matt_Layden,Welcome to Camp Crystal Lake.,7,26 November 2010,"This is the recent remake that takes the first three Friday films and throws it into one. As far as the ""big"" three horror remakes, this one is my favourite. The other two are Texas Chainsaw Massacre and the very recent Nightmare on Elm Street. I thought the filmmakers took a more creative route and tried something different with the character of Jason, whereas the other two were high and dry remakes that made me squirm with disappointment too often.So we start off where the first original film ends, Pamela Voorhees decapitated. We see a little kid, deformed, grab her head and head off into the woods. Flashforward 12 or so years. 5 twenty somethings hike in the woods, two of them planning on stealing a crop of weed that is out in the woods. Sliced and diced! Flashforward a few weeks...again. We see another group of twenty somethings heading up to a cottage, an expensive one. One they travels they run into a guy looking for his missing sister, you guessed it. She was one of the people from the attack a few weeks earlier. Well, Jason shows up, kills more people and what not and we have the same formula that the original films had.So where is this film different? Gone is Jason, the supernatural killer who can die multiple times and keep on coming. Jason has been grounded in reality, he lives off the land, he's a hunter. He has gotten a little smarter too, setting up traps for his victims, like bear traps and using other victims as bait for others. Smart guy. The same overbearing figure is there, we get a glimpse of him with his trademark sack with one eye hole, then he finds his famous hockey mask. I applaud the film for making the characters do stupid things, yet making them not seem stupid themselves. Their actions are results of others. Why does the one guy go to the shed alone in the dark? Other than being drunk, the annoying guy who owns the cottage told him to, because he has to fetch some tools and fix a broken chair. No investigating some strange noises. The film has drugs, sex that is accompanied with a lot of boobies and death. The kills range from his trademark machete, to hatchet, arrow, stabbing, etc. It's funny to me that I prefer the original Nightmare on Elm Street compared to the original Friday the 13th, yet here I prefer the Friday remake.",Friday the 13th
92,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,The best Friday the 13th since part VII,8,19 February 2009,"Interesting angle to this one: the climax of the original film is played out in the opening minutes, then we are thrown head first into a mini movie slaughter. The filmmakers really went out on a limb when they made this film with such a lengthy intro, but it worked well, as the audience (and I) laughed and cheered when the title appears on-screen no less than twenty three minutes into the film, and after such a bloody intro.From there this film becomes an all-encompassing remake of the first five or six Friday the 13th films , with a guy searching for for his missing sister (killed in the first sequences) and meeting up with a group of twenty-somethings staying on the opposite side of the lake who become target practice for Jason, clad in a burlap sack for the first 40 minutes or so.Surprisingly well done; Jason finding his hockey mask for the first time, and stalking and killing the water skier were highlights, as was the climactic battle. Towards the predictable climax, the underground tunnels with the glowing Christmas lights reminded me of the climax from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2, while dumping Jason's body into the lake reminded me of the lousy ending of Jason Lives. I even noticed a reference to Jason X, as we see the hockey mask slowly sinking down into the water in the lake. But who couldn't see the twist ending, Jason jumping out of the water to grab the girl, coming from a mile away? Trent (who was an idiot to begin with) becomes more and more of an ass as the film progresses. His death was appropriately memorable.Derek Mears is possibly the scariest, most unpredictable Jason ever. Kane Hodder was a great Jason, but not a *scary* Jason- we want to see Jason then, rather than fear him or be surprised by him, like we are here, for the first time since part VII.",Friday the 13th

95,moviewizguy,Welcome to Crystal Lake,4,15 February 2009,"Groups of beautiful people go camping to have themselves killed by the infamous Jason Vorhees in predictable, uninspired, bloody ways.So you're a fan of slasher films? Or are you one of those people who wonder why this franchise has inspired eleven sequels, reboot, spinoffs, or what have you? Well, I can say now: People just love, love, love Mr. Vorhees so you know he's not going anytime soon. Right off the bat, I have to say this film looked exciting and fun by its publicity. The hype around it is amazing, although not as big as ""Twilight"" or ""High School Musical"" but it's pretty big. That's just the problem. The film is not good. It's not even a good slasher film and if you know me, I love slashers. I love the clichés and the camp and the ridiculous over-the-top death scenes but this one is different.How is it different, you ask? First of all, it's boring. The movie moves surprisingly slow and the pace was uneven all around. Second, the movie is not entertaining. The film takes itself way too seriously with the lame jokes flying over peoples' head as if they were bad dialogue. Third, most of the characters are one dimensional and so unsympathetic that you want them to die the second you lay eyes upon them. Fourth, the death scenes aren't too great either. They're rather uncreative. Fifth, the film is just too predictable that the movie bores you. The movie, as a whole, is just lifeless.Everything that makes a good slasher movie is not here. The scares are just way too average. The only things that actually scare are the pop up scenes but those get old after being done several times in just the first few minutes. So what's good about the movie? Well, I can say, technically, the film is fantastic. This film knows how to get the camera at the best angles and the use of sound is just fantastic. However, I doubt that's what people are looking for in this type of film.Jared Padalecki doesn't have much to work with because, after all, it's just a slasher. Everyone else either plays a character who loves sex or either loves drugs and that's such a shame. Yes, there are movies out there where they wink at the audience because of the clichés, as if poking fun of the genre, which is totally fine by me, but this film felt like the clichés were just there because of the bad script. The filmmakers also took some characteristics of Jason Vorhees in the previous films but also added elements of their own and some, I will say now, is laughable while others are surprising, although it doesn't do much.Overall, the film is a huge disappointment. ""My Bloody Valentine 3D,"" which came out like a month ago, was better and more entertaining than this and also had more to offer. This film is just a list of ongoing clichés and predictability that does not have fun with itself and doesn't know how to entertain an audience. The film should have been good but what can you say? You can't always get what you want.",Friday the 13th
96,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Friday the 13th"" (2009) is the best entry in the series in a Looonnnggg time. Nevermind the haters, this is pure Jason!",7,9 January 2011,"After eleven films in the original series, Hollywood decided to relaunch the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise. Fans let of a groan, knowing the system would mess up their franchise. I personally let out a sigh of relief. I think the nostalgia and fond memories of spending dark nights huddled around a TV with your friends, watching a scratchy rented VHS copy of ""Friday the 13th Part Whatever"" clouded the truth- the films were never that good, and only became more and more saturated with stupidity and failed potential as the series progressed. They did almost everything they could with the original lineup of films... ""Friday the 13th"" is the 'junk food 'n' beer' of horror... they're fun, enjoyable and accessible, but don't have a lot of quality or sustenance.You could watch ""Friday the 13th Part 8"" without having seen the prior films and understand it. All of the films follow a basic formula. (Jason is brought back, kills some people and gets killed) This formula was never broken in the originals (and to an extent, it exists in this film, with a few twists!), which is one of the weaknesses for the originals after part IV (which I consider the best). The other problem is that at a point, the old films tried gimmicks to stay fresh (Jason vs psychic, Jason in New York, Jason turning into a body-swapping entity, Jason in space), which only complicated the series in a bad way. The only gimmick that seemed to work was ""Freddy VS Jason"", and it worked simply because the filmmakers and actors found a perfect balance of horror, action and humor- something prior ""gimmick"" entries didn't get.So, I don't mind the reboot concept- the series was never high art and while the first four were great, after that, it's hit and miss.So, how did the reboot turn out? Awesome!Directed by Marcus Nispel, and written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, the reboot is essentially a ""Best Of"" compilation, lovingly paying tribute to the earlier films (particularly the first four).It opens with a retelling of the original film's climax, and the demise of Pamela Voorhees, before cutting to a group of students years later, who arrive at Crystal Lake to search for a patch of marijuana planted there. I was worried that these were our lead characters, which I didn't want- they kind of sucked... until BAM! Jason shows up and annihilates everyone, (with some truly disturbing deaths) save for one girl, whose fate is left ambiguous. The opening prologue of the film took me by surprise, and was like its own 15 minute mini-movie, which was a brilliant way to start- like a ""Psycho Switch.""The film then centers on two concurrent story lines- a new group of characters arrive at a cabin on Crystal Lake owned by rich-boy (and raving jerk) Trent (Travis Van Winkle). Trent and his friends (Danielle Panabaker and Aaron Yoo as notable actors, among others) are planning for a vacation of all sorts of poor decision-making (booze, drugs, sex, etc)! You know where this is going...At the same time, a more interesting plot is occurring with Clay (Jared Padalecki), brother of the girl whose fate was not revealed at the beginning. He has spent the past six weeks looking for her, and has to Crystal Lake to search. We soon learn that his sister (Amanda Righetti) is still alive, and is being kept by Jason for reasons unknown.Soon, Jason begins to pick people off left and right, and Clay is forced to team up with Trent and the others to survive and find his sister.The film is well-directed. They really give you that frenetic feel of trying to survive, though I will say that my pet-peeve (overuse of shaky-cam) is present a bit too much. The design of the world is pretty darned good, from the barn, to the cabin owned by the rich guy, to just the woods themselves all around. Everything seems real.Characters are hit and miss. You do find yourself rooting for Clay, Trent'll make you angry, the humorous stoner Chewie (Aaron Yoo) will make you laugh... etc. Yet, for every ""hit"", there's a miss. Some are underdeveloped and some you just forget about. But, considering this is a slasher movie, I can forgive that.The real star of the movie is Derek Mears as Jason. He is almost perfect. While Kane Hodder revolutionized Jason by giving him character, Mears seems to build off of this. He is just so menacing. So evil. Yet you can still detect pain inside.And on Jason- this movie did away with a lot of problems the old movies had in regards to Jason. Mainly, the ""teleporting"" (no matter how fast you run, and how slow Jason walks, he's always right behind you) and the supernatural Hyper-Zombie nonsense. This Jason feels more real.How about the other staples of the series? We get plenty of what you'd think- nudity and blood. I would say there's actually too much nudity at times, but I ain't complaining. And the kills are generally brutal and scary. A few took me by surprise, which usually doesn't happen to me. I will say the final 20 minutes are incredibly suspenseful. One of the best climaxes in the series.All in all, while it's more of the same, it brings enough new to the table to stand out. I have trouble understanding the negativity of some fans... to me, this was an ideal F13th movie. You come to these movies for babes and blood, and this movie delivers on that. It's true to the first four films (which are my favorites), and it fixes a lot of problems from later films.Like I said before, it's a ""best of"", giving us a classic Jason story. And that's what I wanted. A good 7 out of 10 from me!",Friday the 13th
97,rivertam26,The worst of the series,3,15 March 2020,"When I first saw this movie I absolutely hated it. My expectations were on the high side. I loved the f13 franchise and was a big fan of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake which Marcus Nispel was also responsible for. So I thought to myself it was a sure bet especially with the mindset of how hard is it to execute one of these movies. Well apparently quite difficult because this disappointing dumb fest highlights all the things that brought the slasher to a close in the late 80s, Early 90s. And ontop of that he uses the same execution that he did in Chainsaw. It's very serious, drab cinematography and bleached film. All if those suited that film perfectly but here they feel very much out of place. F13 has always been fun and this revamp is anything but. In fact it's quite miserable, drawn out and lifeless. Derek Mears is fine as Hason but the film is nonsensical and 95% of the characters are really unlikable. The hot but bland Jared Padalecki and mousey Danielle Panabaker aside. Watching it now I hate it a little less but it's just not fun in any way, the kills are uninspired and the finale like the rest of the film is just plain stupid. *SPOILER* I mean after everything they go through with the cops on the way they push his body into the lake just for one last cheap jump scare, which sadly sums up the whole experience.1.5/5",Friday the 13th
98,capkronos,Lousy remake/reboot/re-imagining/whatever the latest PR spin word is.,3,21 February 2009,"I didn't expect much of anything other than a few memorable kills and maybe a cheap jump scare here and there. This pathetic excuse for a movie couldn't even deliver that much. For starters, I personally can't stand how recent horror movies are shot. Everything has the same dark, muddy and flat-looking quality, with no real clarity of picture and irritating shakycam going into overdrive during 90 percent of the horror/action scenes because far too many directors today aren't talented enough to stage an effective horror or action scene without it. The gore was often even hard to make out because of the camera-work, too, which renders something like this almost completely pointless. And while the 1980s Friday films aren't what I'd call genre classics, you could at least clearly make out the gory scenes instead of getting a split flash of some CGI effect while the cameraman goes into a seizure. Bah-humbug, I know. But I swear I really did try my best to like this one. Honest!Defenders of this latest bargain basement remake will say things like...""It's not supposed to have a storyline or plot!"" or ""The acting is supposed to be bad!"" or ""The dialogue is supposed to be stupid!"" or ""The characters are supposed to be unbearably obnoxious and annoying!"" or ""It's not supposed to be scary!"" Well OK then. I'd now like to take the opportunity to congratulate Mr. Nispel for making an unscary, ugly-looking, suspense-free movie with bad acting, terrible dialogue, forgettable kills and annoying characters. Way to go Marcus!What other ""goodies"" do we get here? Let's see...For some reason, the film opens with all the credits but waits until about twenty minutes in to reveal the TITLE. Half of the dialogue seems to consist of either the ""f"" word or ""dude."" And what's up with every person talking to themselves? Every time a person was alone they were having a conversation. With whom? I have no clue. When a floorboard creaks it's not really necessary to have someone say ""What was that? I better go upstairs and see what that is!"" Or, in Friday remake terms it's more like... ""What tha @#!* was that @#!* ? Dayum I need to go up doz @#!*' stairs to investigate me some @#!*!"" The characters are all pretty awful - a bunch of annoying, smug, self-satisfied, foul-mouthed twits who seem like they need to immediately be committed to a rehab program. Naturally all the white characters get to pair off and have sex, while no one seems the least bit interested in the one black and one Asian character. Since the black guy can't get laid he's reduced to pleasuring himself while listening to whitey going at it upstairs. At least three different male victims said ""What the @#!*?"" when they were confronted with Jason. The black guy had a slight variation though since he's black. Seriously, whoever wrote this should be embarrassed.The cast was also bad. Travis Van Winkle should never act again. What is the appeal of this guy anyway? He can't act for squat and resembles Vincent from the Beauty and the Beast TV series. And Jared Padalecki (though one of the better actors here) would probably look better without the Farrah Fawcett hairdo. I had a very difficult time telling the actresses they hired apart. When blonde #1 was killed and they cut back to the cabin to blonde #2 I was like ""I thought she was already dead?"" And then there's a missing sister, who I kept confusing with the rich jock's girlfriend toward the end. If you can hire a black and an Asian actor to help diffuse all the shaggy-haired white boys, then why can't you hire an attractive black or Asian actress? Preferrably one who isn't sporting a set of distracting and unnatural-looking silicone cans like several actresses in this film. No wonder Willa Ford couldn't keep herself under water for long! Note to parents: If your daughter begs you for a set of DD bolt-on's for her 18th birthday, get her a Prada handbag instead. She'll thank you later. The film is full of extremely stupid moments and scenes. Getting hit directly in the head by a speedboat going about 50 miles per hour will only result in a tiny little boo-boo. And the extensive lair of underground catacombs under Jason's house? Did Jason dig all that out or is it some sewer system in the middle of the woods? Maybe a former coal mine... with an escape hatch through an overturned school bus? Whaaaaaaa? Then we have Jason keeping a hostage. Well, the Jason I like don't play like that. Are they trying to now ""humanize"" him like Rob Zombie did with Michael Myers in his equally wretched ""remake"" of HALLOWEEN? Urghhh...It all leads up to an ending that fails just as badly as the rest of the movie. The original has that legendary moment that made people jump from their seats while the people who made this botched that opportunity because of a completely awful editing cut. So sad to say, this was sloppy, irritating and pretty much just plain boring. It could have been fun. It's not. JASON GOES TO HELL and JASON X were even better than this!",Friday the 13th
99,oneguyrambling,Kill! Scream! Kill! Run! Kill! Ain't doing it for me at all anymore.,5,30 October 2010,"Remakes. Reboots. Reimaginings.Retarded!Does anyone make anything original anymore? I haven't yet bothered looking back to see when horror started being obviously profitable for studios but I reckon it was about 5 years ago or so. Since then the number of wide released (mainstream?) horror movies have increased exponentially each year, ranging from absolute crap to some pretty cool stuff.Credits are rolling and I feel like ejecting the DVD, ""In association with Michael Bay""! THE Michael Bay who made Bad Boys 2, Pearl Harbour and has single handedly prevented me from watching Transformers (which I had zero interest in anyway).The movie starts with a flashback to 1980 with Jason's dear old mum at the tail end of her murderous rampage. I say the tail-end because in the first real scene she gets her head chopped off by a young girl with a machete. (Which is a feat in itself, the notorious terrorist hostage beheading footage of a few years back showed it is no easy task.)That's the backstory really. A summary of the whole thing: - Jason bullied and drowns (at least nearly). - Jason's mum's p**sed and kills a bunch of teenagers. - Teenager kills mum. - Jason not happy. - Continues killing teenagers.Cut to ""Crystal Lake – Present Day"". A bunch of idiot teenagers trudging through the woods, it turns out they are after a marijuana crop that they've heard grows there. They plan to rip some off and sell it for a healthy profit.Cue lots of ""someone behind something"" shots, in this case trees.I am totally over is the IDIOT TEENAGER syndrome - true I was a total idiot teenager, as were many people I grew up with and I'm sure millions since - but the level of pure moron-ness on display in this film is infuriating. They are all horny, boneheaded, smoking, drinking, profane self centred caricatures with fake boobs, the rest are the same - just without the redeeming boobs.And before you tell me that yep that is pretty close to your standard teenagers nowadays, justify to me why I should care that they are then all killed in gruesome fashion. It makes me want to cheer for the bad guy.Also it seems that if you live in an area with dodgy mobile phone coverage, you'd be best served moving house, as this is invariably where all the haunted houses and serial mass murderers live. Although to be fair it sorta does help explain Jason's murderous rage, he can't enter into most competitions and wasn't able to vote for Clay Aiken in American Idol! Anyway on the DVD I rented this is the way that Batch 1 went out:Kill 1 – Couldn't see. Machete I think. Kill 2 – Terrible kill, illogical. (Watch for yourself and tell me why she couldn't get away. Do they make sleeping bags out of asbestos now?) Kill 3 – Shaky camera meant I couldn't see. Usual guy pulled through floor to miraculously explode in blood storm. Maybe a blender was under the floor? Kill 4/5 – No suspense, just finishing the job so we can move to6 weeks later.In a local service station slash convenience store a Stranger is asking if the store worker would mind him putting up a ""Missing"" poster, leading to various HUH? moments.HUH? Moment 1. The convenience store guy says no. Who has been to a local deli and not seen a local cork noticeboard? Would it have ruined the plot if he said yes?HUH? Moment 2. (My favourite.) An IDIOT TEENAGER behind him from Batch 2 says something to the effect of ""Move it, you're being a d*ck."" What? A guy is looking for his missing sister in a polite and patient way and is being a d*ck!Batch 2 of reprehensible IDIOT TEENAGER'S arrive and here we go againWe've got around 50 minutes to go from this point. A lot of teenagers die, no-one cares. A couple have sex, a couple of girls get nude enough I guess.The problem here is that when the plot is when the backstory contains 5 points and the movie really starts with the last and stays there, how do you fill 90 odd minutes and keep it interesting? In the case of Friday the 13th you can't.This film is at times suspenseful yet totally disposable. As mentioned the backstory is explained in maybe eight minutes, then we have 90+ minutes with ""Noise / startled teenager / view from behind something / Jason appears and kills"". This happens (with only precious minor variation) some dozen or so times!Jason remains an enigma, if not indestructible then able to take immense punishment, able to catch sprinting teenagers while never breaking a slow stride, and able to appear behind someone regardless of how impossible this may seem. At one point he kills one of the ITs on the front yard, and when the others look out the window only seconds later he is on the ROOF! We never really see what he does with the bodies or how he hides them, we aren't sure if he still has hate or if he is simply a mindless killing machine.When your target audience are the type that say ""Oh my God!! He just killed that guy!!"" 12 times a movie, I guess you don't need to.Final Rating – 5 / 10. I wanted so badly for these kids to be killed earlier. 2 out of 5 of the points given are for items described as ""stupendous"" in the film.If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com",Friday the 13th

I thought this was a very awesome film and highly lived up to my expectations! I love how Jason gets his infamous hockey mask. I love the creative death scenes. I love the storyline. I love the small details like Jason's bedroom filled with creepy lookin' toys. Some parts were really creepy. Everybody did an amazing job at kick-starting the Friday the 13th series! Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Amanda Righetti, Travis Van Winkle, Aaron Yoo, and all Jason's victims did awesome jobs! Even Derek Mears made an incredible Jason Voorhees! Clay Miller is searching for his missing sister. He runs into some teens who are spending the weekend at Trent's parents' cabin. We find out that Jason is holding Clay's sister, Whitney hostage because he thinks Whitney looks just like his mother, who is decapitated at the beginning at the movie. It's awesome that Jason can move fast and run. He can think this time, because he's smart. This is the best, maybe the perfect Friday the 13th movie because of Jason, the characters, and the sexy women! If you love horror, remakes, Jason, and the Friday the 13th series, I highly recommend Friday THE 13TH!!! p.s. There was a little kid in my theater, and he wore a Jason mask to watch with the movie. That kid is awesome!",Friday the 13th
101,ketgup83,An average flick...,6,14 December 2010,"Friday the 13th was violent, brutal and scary movie that kept me engrossed throughout. The movie starts with an old lady killing few people until she gets beheaded by a girl in Crystal Lake. This is followed later by her son avenging his mother's murder. He is Jason. Jason is on the verge of killing everyone whoever visits Crystal Lake. Though the movie was scary and was brutal at times but what was not explained in the film was why he was killing everyone who comes to the Crystal Lake without any reason. The movie is just a typical horrifying, sometimes scary and sometimes over the top entertainment where you don't require to use your brains and simply enjoy the way Jason murders one by one. Direction was just about okay. Cinematography was good. As far as acting is concerned, all were fresh faces with ordinary acting. So if you don't have anything to do in the evening and wanna just have some scary momentsyou will be enjoying this movie. 2.5-5",Friday the 13th
102,baumer,To the fans.....with love.,9,18 February 2009,"This review does contain some heavy spoilers. Proceed at your own risk.I'll try not to get all nostalgic in this review and I'll try to contain some of my excitement, but Friday the 13th the reboot is nothing short of awesome. I have been a fan, of course, since I was perhaps 10 years old. The first four films are some of the better 80's horror films and The Final Chapter is, in my opinion, one of the ten best horror films ever made. The efforts after the fourth ranged from good to abhorrent. This series clearly needed some new and fresh minds to work on it and who better to resurrect a horror icon than the same team that gave us The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake? Michael Bay, Brad Fuller (and the rest) and Marus Nispel should be very proud of what they have done here. They have taken the biggest horror icon of the last 50 years and breathed new life into him. With films like Friday 9, Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X, the series and the character had nowhere else to go but up. In short, the 8th through 10th were embarrassing films and they tarnished a once proud horror franchise to the point of needing an absolution. This is that absolution.Fuller and company did their research and they found out what endeared the series to so many people. From 1980-1984, these films were made for less than 2 million dollars and three of them went onto to gross more than 30 million dollars. They were huge profit makers for Paramount. Jason was mean, he was unmerciful and the formula for the films were very consistent. You needed nudity, killings every few minutes and you needed characters that you didn't necessarily care about but that behaved in a certain way. By the time The Final Chapter hit, the craft of creating a Friday film was molded nicely. Joseph Zito upped the ante by going a few steps further. This current Friday the 13th feels and behaves like an early Friday film.We start off at Camp Crystal Lake on June 13th, 1980. We basically skip all of the original Friday as Mrs. Voorhees gets beheaded within the first five minutes of the film. We cut ahead to 2009 where 5 kids are hiking in the Crystal Lake woods in search of some weed. We have the customary two couples and the tag along geeky/smart guy. They decide to camp just beyond the camp that has been shut down for 30 years. In a beautiful homage to Friday the 13th part II, Wade tells the story about how the events from part one took place. Soon after people go off to have sex or talk about important things deep in the woods. Wade goes off to find the weed and then all hell breaks loose. Jason, sans hockey mask, pretty much slaughters everyone and after some of the most brutal deaths in any Friday the 13th, the Friday the 13th logo comes up on screen. It is perhaps the best beginning to any Friday film and the audience cheered when the logo comes up.The rest of the film has more kids going to Crystal Lake and then you have a character, played by Jared Padalecki, who is hunting for his missing sister. His name is Caly Miller, another nice homage to the original series creator Victor Miller. He is the best part of the film acting wise and he is also tall and broad and fills the screen so that when he goes one on one with Jason, you actually believe he can do some of the things he does.Friday the 13th is a beautiful film for fans like me. The producers, imo, researched the great things about the originals and they listened. There are some complaints about the film from some, but again, in my opinion, all of these complaints can be explained.First of all Jason did run in part 2 and 3 and 4. I'm not going to list every time he ran, but think of the time he chased Chris in part 3. Also, when he does the kidnapping in this one, it is a bit of an extension of his character, but this could of happened as if he were behaving like Part 2. In the second film, he lived in the woods and had his mom's head enshrined. He is a man, and he has to eat and sleep and do other things. They explained why she was kidnapped. I had no issues with this at all.Friday the 13th the reboot is on par with Texas Chainsaw Massacre the reboot. I can only hope they give A Nightmare on Elm Street this much care. Please do not make Freddy a comedian. If you can treat him the way you treated Jason, all will be right with the horror world.9/10",Friday the 13th
103,jaredmobarak,You should have been watching him  Friday the 13th,5,10 February 2009,"The scariest part of the new remake Friday the 13th  that's right, getting into your car and realizing that the eternity was only 90 minutes. All jokes aside, what I learned from the newest installment in one of horror's never-ending franchises is that you do not mess with Jason Voorhees's weed. The guy has a nice little crop growing over there at Camp Crystal Lake, and he protects it with his machete and burlap bag covered grotesque mug. Honestly, the first few deaths can all be attributable to people trying to cut in on the drug trade, but don't worry, that story thread is soon abandoned and we get back to the gratuitous nudity, impressive death scenes where you actually get to see things impaled into people's heads numerous times, and a lot of running and screaming away from the big guy. I apologize for being so tongue-in-cheek here, because the film really wasn't that tragic. I'll admit that the original bored me to tears and I enjoyed Freddy Vs Jason, (probably because I love me some Kruger), and this one had some laughsthat's right, the laughs workedand some decent moments as far as the genre goes. Still, though, that banned Nike commercial with the out of shape Jason is by far the best adaptation of the myth, or was that more Texas Chainsaw? What the film gets right: playing a Santogold track during a sex scene, so I could at least enjoy a good tune. Okay, I'll be serious now  I really enjoyed the beginning, no joke. It all starts with the revelation that concludes the original film. Here is young Jason's mother coming upon the last camp counselor that neglected him, allowing his drowning in the lake. She has killed everyone else and is about to complete her revenge when her inevitable demise occursall while the boy watches on. Was he really dead? Did he rise from purgatory to avenge himself and his mother? Who cares; he's there, he's sad, and he decides to spend the next twenty years bulking up like a professional wrestler, earning all his merit badges, (I mean look at those perfect knots collecting dust on his cabin's wall), and honing his archery skills with deadly precision. But that's not all for the prologue to the tale, no, we also get to watch a horny quintet visit the secluded area and be ravished sexually by each other and violently by the homicidal maniac. This is where it may hurt me being such a cinema fan; I knew it was still the prologue since none of the ""stars"" were yet in attendance. Everyone else in the theatre seemed to not know this and clapped when the title finally made its way on screen about twenty minutes in.Why did that short sequence work, besides having everything you need in a successful slasher filmnamely gore, Jonathan Sadowski's fantastic comic relief, a very not so shy America Olivo, and the discovery of Jason's creepily realized lair? It did because everyone was expendable, no stars had to survive until the end because they are collecting a paycheck and our country's short attention spans need a recognizable face to fork over their hard-earned cash. This is what true genre success needs, absolute anonymity and the unknown of who may survive, if anyone. Unfortunately, after those twenty minutes, we are treated to your regular run-of-the-mill/get your frights mediocrity. Rich kids galore with Daddy's boy prick versus brooding leading man looking for his sister, (who had been taking care of their cancer stricken mother, cue the sensitivity tears), and the obligatory machismo rearing its head like only spoiled brats can show. You want them all to die, and for the most part they do, but it is just so obvious and cliché; the only enjoyment you'll get will be wondering what horrific fatality can be coming next.I lied, that's not the only enjoyment; there is always Aaron Yoo. The guy truly is gold in everything I've seen him in. Ultimately here for comic relief, I actually hoped he might somehow survive all the carnage. He and Arlen Escarpeta are great together, (love the exchange concerning the bong), and I found them so much more endearing then Travis Van Winkle's Trent, whom you want to kill yourself, and our leads Jared Padalecki and Danielle Panabaker. It appears that ""Supernatural"" isn't paying enough these days with both stars seeking shelter in horror remakes, (co-star Jensen Ackles just graced the silver screen in My Bloody Valentine 3D). Padalecki is okay; the film doesn't ask too much from him and he isn't one to try and do more than he should. Panabaker, on the other hand, is a very interesting choice to be cast here. Known mostly as a mousy, nerdy girl in Empire Falls and Sky High, she is all of a sudden the ""girlfriend"" of mister Joe Cool Popular Trent and a total departure from the big-bosomed blonde bimbos her group consists of. Inspired casting? Sure, maybe. Does she shine and carry the film into a credible stratosphere? No.When all is said and done, if you enjoy slasher films for what they usually promiseblood, camp, nudity, and more bloodyou'll probably have a good time. It's all been done before, the turning of old classics that had a shred of subtlety and nuance into quasi-snuff films. However, since I wasn't a big fan of the original, I appreciated what director Marcus Nispel attempted. Rather than a remake, he instead opens the film with a distilled version of the 1980 original, (even captioning the first scene as 1980 before getting to the ""present day""), and makes his own piece to add to the legacy of the hockey mask. More Jason XI than Jason I Redux, it could have been a lot worse. But then again, I could have stayed home and not been any worse for wear.",Friday the 13th

107,ivo-cobra8,An awesome horror slasher reboot Jared Padalecky was the best in this film,10,24 September 2017,"This reboot in my opinion is a great horror slasher film from 2009 mostly because of Jared Padalecki. In this reboot from Friday the 13th film series, Jared Padalecki from Supernatural was awesome in this. Both of the actors from Supernatural Jansen Ackles and Jared Padalecki in 2009 were playing in a horror slasher remakes the lead protagonists. Jensen Ackles tried with the film My Blood Valentine 3D playing Tom J. Hanniger the main protagonist. While Jared Padalecki tried his portrayal the protagonist Clay Miller in Friday the 13th (2009). I must say both of the actors did a good job in each horror slasher remakes! I watched both of the movies separately and I loved them. I love Jensen Ackles and I love Jared Padalecki! Jared Padalecki in my opinion did great and a lot better job then Jensen Ackles did in My Bloody Valentine 3D I have enjoyed Friday the 13th movie way better then I did My Bloody Valentine (2009). I seriously think this reboot is great slasher film and miles way better then My Blood Valentine and miles way better than A Nightmare on Elm Street (2010) remake. That movie sucked so much, I hated it.Do I think this movie is better than the original slasher film? No! Of course not Friday the 13th (1980) is a classic slasher horror film and my fifth favorite Friday the 13th film and it always will be. But it is a good horror movie entertaining and very intense, scary and creepy as well. Do I think Derek Mears is better Jason Voorhees than C.J. Graham and Kane Hodder? No I don't think so but in my opinion it is as good as the original film not better tough.A group of young adults discover a boarded up Camp Crystal Lake, where they soon encounter Jason Voorhees and his deadly intentions.I have the killer cut on Blu-ray that is more gory and scary the was the original version and it has a lot of scary moments in it. The movie scared me so many times at point.Marcus Nispel directed this movie and I thought he did a good job directing it I like it a lot more then Freddy Vs. Jason cause I thought Derek Mears did way better job then Ken Kirzinger did.Jared Padalecki was great as Clay Miller who was searching for his missing sister I love movies like this, I really miss movies like this. Why can't they make movies like this one today? Danielle Panabaker from The Flash is in this movie as Jenna and she does a good solid job. Ryan Hansen from Veronica Mars is also in this film in which he is killed by Jason when he get's arrow in his head. Travis Van Winkle as Trent is also good as a selfish asshole he isn't that bad in this movie.A lot of people dislike and hate this film I don't I like scary horror movies and this one is a guilty pleasure of mine and it is a movie I will always watch. I like it.The problems with the film I have: first they rebooted all three films we see young woman cut Mrs. Voorhees head and escapes in present, suddenly we have Jason with a sack on his head when he later find's a hockey mask and becomes a slasher homicidal maniac he was before. What happened to that girl that killed Jason's mother? it was never explained what happened to her. Jason was way too smart killer in this movie, he kidnapped Whitney (Amanda Righetti) which I don't understand why. Jason never kidnapped people in the series before. Why did he kidnapped that girl and hold her a prisoner? it is weird. On the end of the movie after Clay and Whitney kills Jason and they throw him in the lake, why did Jason jump and grab Whitney when he was dead?, makes no sense to me. Other things I did enjoy this film and I have enjoy it better then My Bloody Valentine 3D. I have the killer cut in My Blu-ray collection in this movie and I hardly wait till I get whole franchise on Blu-ray, I am so happy.Terror never dies. Producer Michael Bay and the director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre take you back to where the terrifying nightmare began. At Crystal Lake what started as the best weekend of their lives could quickly become their last, A group of teens, miles from civilization, are about to learn, one by one, that the lake has a bloody...past and it's ready for revenge.Friday the 13th is a 2009 American slasher film written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, and directed by Marcus Nispel. The film is a reboot of the Friday the 13th film series, which began in 1980, and is the twelfth installment in the film series.This movie get's A 9/10 it is my eight favorite Friday the 13th movie and I am glad I have enjoy this movie so damn much I highly recommended.",Friday the 13th
108,juliankennedy23,Friday the 13 (2009)... Mother did it need to be so high?,9,30 October 2009,"Friday the 13 (2009): 8 out of 10: Jason is a bit off in this one. He moves to fast, he kidnaps people like he watched Rest Stop one too many times and he seems to lack a certain hulking presence of the original. Outside of the main character however, this is a pretty good Friday the 13th film. Friday the 13th is billed as a relaunch (remake reboot etc) and as such it seems to confuse. It contains plot elements of the first four films (Mrs. Voorhees decapitation takes place in flashback) and Jason rightfully starts with his original sack and finds his hockey mask (as he did in part 3). In addition, while I am critical of Jason having his own “lair” I am reminded he had one in Part 2 (Where he kept his mothers severed head lovingly surrounded by candles). The main plot of a man trying to find his missing sister is straight from part 4. Where the film succeeds is canon fodder and nudity. There are plenty of both and most of it is of high quality. The kills range from mundane (of these there are plenty) surprisingly intense (A burning sleeping bag may cause nightmares and the topless wakeboarding will cause nothing but smiles.) The sheer number and variety of kills however is quite impressive.Camp Crystal Lake has apparently turned into a breast implant recovery retreat. While there is only one camp counselor to be found (in grainy flashback no less) there are plenty of woman with breast implants and an aversion to wearing shirts. Julianna Guill (who in fairness may be au-natural) in particular gets points for simply being one of the most attractive women I have seen on-screen in many a movie. (Willa Ford of the topless wakeboarding scene is not half bad either.)Considering the number of times the Friday the 13th films have gone of the rails in the past, one should not raise the bar all that high. In addition, while I am an unabashed fanboy of the series, I do recognize it does have serious limitations. (What we now refer to as its charms.) This is a flashier, more competently lensed Friday the 13th, and all in all is that such a bad thing?There are plenty of bad jokes, drugs, nudity and violence. If that is not what you were looking for you may want to check the title screen again. As Friday the 13th movies go this is one of the best.",Friday the 13th
109,fernandoschiavi,"Serving as a good tribute to the legacy of Jason Voorhees, this Friday the 13th pleases for nostalgia and technical improvement. Jason deserves more chances to terrify!",6,12 September 2021,"Alongside Freddy Krueger, from ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" franchise, and Michael Myers, from ""Halloween"", the hockey mask killer made the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise one of the biggest icons of the so-called ""slashers movies"" (movies in which the killer kills everyone who sees along the way) from the 1980s and 1990s. After no less than 10 films - 11 if you count ""Freddy X Jason"" -, countless deaths and resurrections, and the quality of the movies falling with each sequence, it seemed that Jason was finally going to limbo. But not.When New Line Cinema approached Platinum Dunes by Michael Bay, Andrew Form and Brad Fuller about the idea of bringing Jason Voorhees back into the popular imagination, this practice was already common. Death Calls for a Ride, The Chainsaw Massacre and Amityville Horror were the main remakes the producer had released up to that time, and Friday the 13th would be the big project that would bring the iconic killer back to his glory days, opting for reinventing mythology, rather than continuing it. For the restart of the series, they had the sensible idea of bringing those who had already had experience in the subject: Marcus Nispel, who commanded the good remake of ""The Chainsaw Massacre"" and this film fulfills his role well.The plot takes us to the beginning of Jason Voorhees' attacks (played here by the huge Derek Mears), showing us the massacre of his mother, Pamela (Nana Visitor) before diving into the main narrative. In it, a group of teenagers go on vacation at one of them's country house, located right in the area of the former Crystal Lake camp, where Jason had drowned as a child. The stage is set for the new cycle of murders to begin. Of course, there's no getting away from the basic premise of franqua, which obviously takes us back to the group of promiscuous and adventurous friends who take advantage of the absence of adults for sex, drinking, and drugs. In the middle of the woods, of course, as is the law in the movies on Friday the 13th.All this is very repetitive for those who have seen all the other features, but what is interesting about the script by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift is to see how the pair compress and adapt the premises and narrative elements of the first four films in the franchise, with a series of easter eggs and references that will please hardcore fans. Using the story of Pamela Voorhees during the opening credits is a genius move, as is the 15-minute long prologue that introduces us to a group of teenagers we assume are the protagonists, only to have a hooded Jason kill them one by one. After a few weeks, Clay (Jared Padalecki) goes to the mysterious Crystal Lake forest in search of his missing sister. There he finds the remains of old huts, apparently abandoned. Despite being warned by officials and locals, he decides to explore the place together with a young woman, who is in a group that was formed to spend a weekend of adventures. What they didn't expect was to find Jason Voorhess (Derek Mears), the hockey mask killer.The characters, as expected, follow all the clichés of the genre. However, even though most are shallow, we have competent performances by Danielle Panabaker (the final girl of the time) and the amusing Aaron Yoo, who plays the obligatory comic relief. And, in a great tribute to Friday the 13th Part IV: The Final Chapter, Jared Padalecki gives life to a guy who is looking for his missing sister (who died during the prologue) and ends up winning the public's affection for being a considerably more mature figure. And focused among so many teenagers.Regardless of the original source, making a remake is always viewed with angry eyes as bad movies are deserving of a new guise, but remade classics of the genre always sound like purely commercial interest with the excuse of attracting new fans and rescuing production source. There are exceptions, of course. When using only the original concept in a completely new production, the result is often satisfactory. According to the producers, this new version would not be recounting the story of the original, but joining the stories of the first four films into one. Because they thought fans of the show wouldn't want to see Jason's mom, fans wanted to see LEGEND live again. And they were absolutely right.The result, simply called Friday the 13th, is everything you would expect from a good ""slasher movie"" (the typical maniac movie) and more... Nispel has a keen aesthetic sense acquired in the advertising market and uses it to create some of the most surprising, no-nonsense gore kills in the entire series, balancing humor and tension. Under Nispel's lens, the new Jason (Derek Mears) is more lethal than ever. He was promoted from a machete-wielding apparition to a tormented hunter of sorts, someone endowed with extensive tracking skills, accurate aim, and an all-too-private sense of ""justice"" instilled in his mind by his late mother. Jason hunts, as always, the hot young people who venture into the Cristal Lake region. This time the victims come in groups... first in search of a legendary marijuana farm that has grown out of control on the shores of the lake. Then, as a group of friends who are going to spend a weekend there. Linking both tours is a young man (Jared Padalecki, from Supernatural) in search of his missing sister.During the remake, directed by the great Marcus Nispel, we see several homages and known deaths. A point that revolted some fans was the fact that Jason keeps a victim in captivity, although many find it completely appropriate, there are reasons for this to happen and even ""Part 2"" of the original franchise had used this idea (but in the remake it is enlarged). Another situation that caused discomfort was the fact that Jason ran. In the early films of the original franchise, when Jason was still more human, he also ran and saw Jason running and hunting, a true predator in the forests of Crystal Lake. We can even say that Jason is vain, especially in the scene where he finds the hockey mask and wears it for the first time. His aggressions are always loaded with physical violence, with bodies being thrown everywhere, and a lot of fighting. He is not immortal, he feels pain and rage - proven in the scene where he discovers that something that belonged to him was taken. Derek Mears (The Return of the Damned) fulfilled his role satisfactorily, with his body always upright, letting his physical aspect shine through.In terms of direction, this is probably the best technically accomplished Friday the 13th. Daniel Pearl's photography is effective in building a tense atmosphere thanks to the strong contrast and high black levels, even during scenes where we observe the natural beauty of Crystal Lake, and the effect is definitely reinforced in the suspense scenes. Marcus Nispel does a good job of driving all the horror sequences, and also bringing a less comic and more impactful approach to gore, which follows a more ""realistic"" school. Violence is not extremely graphic, but it is there to amuse the audience. As a highlight among the killings, there is a scene involving a police officer and a camera that crosses a door. Well conducted, the scene is the best moment in the film, when despair overtakes the characters, given the coming confrontation. The director himself knew that it was necessary to respect the premise, but somehow surprise the audience. There are some ingredients that demarcate the language of this type of production: the sexy girls with their breasts exposed, the drug-using boys, the jokers on duty (one of Jason's favourites), as well as the distant, abandoned scenic space and the ideal stage for the performance of the antagonist and his sharp melee weapons.Steve Jablonski's soundtrack is very incisive and up-to-date. There are references to the work of Harry Manfredini; however, the production adds a new twist to this remake. The efficient editing speeds up the evolution of the narrative and the photography direction makes good use of the scenography to offer sophisticated images that go beyond scares, deaths and persecutions. There is some influence of Mortal Games in the production. It's not every victim Jason kills instantly. The screenwriters decided to include a more humanized view of the character, by presenting the space where the character uses as his quarters. Such an attempt at humanization only occurred in the second film in the series, but it was not deepened as in this 2000's version.At 97 minutes long, Friday the 13th is a dynamic and stylish film. There is no charge for the script because as we sit down to watch this kind of movie, we already know exactly what to expect: a masked psychopath decimating half a world of young people in an abandoned place. Here, there is an attempt to sketch a more complex profile for Jason, as well as portray some characters in more depth, different from previous episodes of the franchise. Serving as a good tribute to the legacy of Jason Voorhees, this Friday the 13th pleases for nostalgia and technical improvement. Even though it has its share of flaws, it's a good remake/reboot and shows that Crystal Lake's killer still deserves to terrify the screens.",Friday the 13th
110,FilmMan47,"No Amount Of Hot Babes,Nudity & Blood Could Managed To Save This Film",3,24 February 2015,Friday the 13th franchise is ruined seriously this is one of the worst reboot of a film series ever i used to be mad about only James Bond being ruined by Daniel Craig but no there are plenty other series out there going in trash by Hollywood just for sake of cash.The first hit-man 2007 was great but now the agent 47 film is about to release and it will suck honestly same goes for this series i have not seen all those original films but can easily say classic own this any day they are much better then this crap released by paramount studios.What is worth looking at here let me tell you absolutely nothing except the cast all the women are hot including Amanda Righetti who gets wasted but Julliana Gill & America Olivia show some breasts but that is so limited even on the killer cut edition DVD the extra scenes are 7 to 8 minutes long but still useless.I mean what were these makers trying to do kill another good character like Jason Vorhees he may not be good as Saw or other serial crazy killers but he is good at least he kills bad people that's what attracted me towards him i am no fan but still if they wanted to do a remake then should have done properly or leave it alone period.My rant is about the sorry excuse of using the sex and adding stupid characters these makers add that have very less to do with the plot but more in affecting the pace and causing damage to the narrative.You wanna add sex please make a porno i want to see the character more not dumb bimbos flaunting their flesh at the screen.Where is the character buildup and good action i want a film not a fantasy film with wrong story angle.If i wrote this instead i would have given Jason Voorhees a rocket launched and a mini gun so he could go fill Rambo mode on everyone because 80 percent of the film is filled with lame dialogs and scenery chewing the runtime but when Jason does start to kill there is bad camera work and no light use.The plot:some young teens go to an area for fun where the legend of Jason Voorhees the serial killer is famous the legend comes to life when these fool teens slowly start to learn about him but time is running out for them as they are about to become his next target.There is a lot of yelling and jumping and what is Jason doing letting these guys escape he should have just done it quick but what can we do after this is typical Hollywood bug i am not blaming actor Derek Mears he looked awesome tall and sexy it is the execution part both technical vise and script.I wanted a good twist but no Jason Voorhees was acting like Kane from Wwe going out for character his killing methods are like from some cheap video game.Friday the 13th became a huge franchise over the years and people raised expectations but i am not even a fan of this series i did not expected anything good but this lousy remake is not even below average.Hey maybe its not the director or the team it is the studio like paramount who restrict great filmmakers and do no let them work in free space but when they do their stuff is hidden and chopped off of no reason hell yes i am talking about mission impossible 2 of sir john woo still fans are waiting for the uncut version but Paramout never releases it may i ask why they are bent on killing good film series and hiding good footage in their vaults this film came out in 2009 wow so many years passed and no sequel yet so guys get ready for another reboot in near future cause this series is done for i am kissing it goodbye.Overall Friday The 13th 2009 is the worst film ever made my rating is 3/10:Skipp It not even recommended for hardcore fans.,Friday the 13th
111,mario_c,The original Jason is back!,6,23 February 2009,"This recent ""Friday the 13th "" is not really a remake of any film of the series but rather an alternative sequel to the original movie.

It's atmospheric, suspenseful, has nice gore scenes and nudity as the original films in the series; and it's also far away from the ridiculous explanations of the last movies of the series (especially since the 6th chapter). It's in the same line of other recent remakes, like Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Amityville, among others. Not being a great film is not bad either. I score it 6/10.",Friday the 13th
112,Superunknovvn,Underwhelming,4,15 February 2009,"The remake of Friday The 13th"" is an opportunity wasted. It was the chance for Jason to finally appear in a movie with big production values, lots of gore and originality. Instead most fans will tell you that Marcus Nispel's ""Friday"" was merely okay, somewhere between parts 4 and 6 in their approval. That, however, is not okay, because frankly neither ""The Final Chapter"" nor ""Jason Lives"" were very good movies in the first place.Now, don't get me wrong. I love the ""F13""-franchise just as much as the next guy. Jason scared the crap out of me as a kid, and for that he will always have a special place in my heart. Still, the original movies are mostly a bore, if we're being honest. The characters are shallow as can be, most deaths aren't as bloody or as shocking as we remembered them, and everything that happens in between the bloodshed is extremely tedious. Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers and Pinhead all have first movies that are true classics and make up for the exploitation that came afterwards. With ""Friday The 13th"" there's just no genuinely great entry to point to when haters roll their eyes.This is where the remake could have stepped in. With a high budget and a fresh start Jason should finally have been given the treatment he deserves. Unfortunately, the creative minds behind the remake didn't get the feel of a typical Jason-movie at all. This isn't the tongue-in-cheek violence and sex-laden movie that has been promised to us. This version of ""F13"" seems more like a bad rehash of ""All The Boys Love Mandy Lane"", which was in itself the rehash of a rehash of a ""Friday""-movie.The writers have to take some responsibility for that, but the director is just as much to blame. Marcus Nispel seemed like a good choice at first, since his ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre""-remake had been entertaining and an appropriate modernization of the original. Sadly, Nispel couldn't do the same thing for ""F13"" as he brought absolutely no fresh ideas to the table.The director tortures us with what he probably thinks is suspense, but where is the suspense in Jason stalking a victim, we already know isn't going to get away? Jason always pops up exactly when and where you expect him to, making this movie completely jump-free. On top of that the kills are totally lame and predictable. In 2009 having a mute slasher kill people with an axe or a machete just doesn't cut it anymore (no pun intended). Nispel probably wanted to go back to the basics, but it really just seems as if no one could think of any cool ways for Jason to slaughter his victims. Alright, not all kills are completely worthless. One involving Jason on a dock is kinda fun, another one with a sleeping bad is slightly original and a third one with a bow and arrow comes from out of nowhere, but these are the only mild highlights in the entire movie.Nispel said the remake would combine elements of the first four parts in the original series. That's only true in that Jason goes from wearing a sack to wearing his legendary mask. Mrs. Voorhees has a cameo, too, but that classic background story of her avenging the supposed death of Jason is buried under the opening credits. It's completely wasted and filmed in an extremely uninspried way, like all the moments that should have been iconic but weren't (like Jason's first appearance, him finding the mask et al).Before the main story finally begins, there's another prologue with a group of young adults getting killed off one by one. After that we have to sit through 20 more minutes (it sure feels longer) of pointless ""character development"" as we see yet another group of teenagers arriving at Chrystal Lake (characters which can quickly be summed up as two jocks, two sluts, two cultural minority-tokens and, er, a nice girl... you know, the kind of guys who would typically hang out together).Jason himself doesn't look awful, although the lovable retard has looked better before. For one, I much prefer him wearing a jumpsuit to that trendy coat he's been given. Secondly, the one time we see him without his mask, he has that retarded redneck look that he also displayed in parts 2 to 4. While I will say that it was probably a good idea to present Jason as more of a human being in this movie, personally I've always found him more intriguing as the supernatural zombie he has become in part 6.While not as bad as Rob Zombie's ""Halloween"" (there was more to ruin there), ""Friday The 13th"" is also a big letdown. When it comes to gruesome gore, Jason just cannot keep up with Jigsaw or his ilk from movies like ""Frontiére(s)"" and ""Haute tension"" anymore. That's fine. I'm not looking for ultra-realistic torture-violence in a Jason-flick, anyway, but a ""Friday""-movie should be fun. And this one wasn't.As a result I'm having mixed feelings about the huge success that Nispel's movie has turned out to be. On one hand I love to see Jason still attracting huge audiences. If that means more ""Friday The 13th""-sequels, I'll be a happy camper (pun intended). On the other hand, I don't want producers to think that this is the way a ""Friday""-movie should be done, and I don't want Nispel's version to be the foundation stone to a new beginning in the franchise. Hopefully they will continue the old ""Friday""-tradition of sequels that have nothing to do with their predecessors. That would be the only way that I could see this series get back on track from here on.After having seen what has been done to Michael and Jason, I can only say: Please, PLEASE GOD, don't let them do the same to Freddy!",Friday the 13th
113,DarthVoorhees,"This proves it, the old ghouls are still the best after all",5,21 February 2009,"Jason Voorhees was/is the poster child for the slasher film.Show somebody a goalie mask, even somebody who hates horror films, and they will associate it with the Crystal Lake killer. Jason was a force more than a character and he survived his share of both good outings and bad outings. What separated Jason from his knock offs was that the films developed a connection to the public. The audience wanted tits, a monster and carnage and Jason delivered. Sure John Carpenter's Halloween knew how to truly scare us but Jason knew how to entertain us time and time again. The Friday the 13th films were never really good in the cinematic pallet but they offered an experience which brought people back to the cinema year after year during the 80's. I think Marcus Nispel and Michael Bay failed to understand what really made Jason a cut above the rest.Over the course of this saga a mythology developed to explain who Jason was and what made him tick. Nispel and crew all most completely ignore everything. We have the Camp and Jason's decapitated mother but they serve really as a setting and plot pieces rather than being a part of Jason's twisted soul. Camp Crystal Lake is Jason and Jason is Camp Crystal Lake. Fans were disappointed in the series after ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" because it took away from Jason. Seeing Jason go to a spoiled rich kid's beach house is disappointing. Jason doesn't hunt his prey for the sake of hunting his prey. The mythology is that Jason kills the young adolescent adult because they are what destroyed his mother and his life. Beneath the hockey mask is a dark soul, here Jason is a tank and we don't get to develop a relationship with him like we did in the superior Friday films. The horror film fan identifies with their favorite character and Derek Mears simply isn't the Jason I remembered and loved.I suppose the acting is as good as your going to get in a film like this. Some of it is actually good, my aversion is to the material. This Friday's teens fit the clichés to the book. The teens go out on their own little vices and are promptly murdered. It takes away so much of the suspense and tension when this happens. Sure the original Friday's kids weren't very smart and did many of the same things but they had soul and the scripts weren't as lazy as it is here. They tried to give some of the characters a little spunk so we remembered them and identified with them. I personally couldn't care if these fraternity kids lived or died.Here is my biggest problem with the film though. It isn't set in the 80's. Why after Platinum Dunes spent so much time and detail setting their Texas Chainsaw and Amityville Horror in the respective decade, do they not put Jason in the decade he belongs? Jason has so much cult appeal because he is so ""80's"". I wanted to see the hair and the fashion and instead we get whining about cell phone reception. I thought Platinum Dunes understood that it only adds to the remake by putting the characters in the environment we must identify them in. I guess if we get a sequel it will be a prequel about Jason's mother which is June 13th 1980, a date which will live in horror lure.Friday the 13th has style but no heart.",Friday the 13th
114,acidburn-10,Jason doing what he does best,6,23 July 2009,"After years of waiting for a new Jason movie, it finally arrives in a form of a remake, probably because they have officially run out of ideas and are starting all over again. The Friday the 13th remake was probably the most hyped horror movie of the year, with websites and magazines whetting fans' appetites for the twelve months that led up to its recent release.Friday the 13th opens in 1980 with a brief sequence that recaps the final moments of the original movie, with a bruised and beaten counselor decapitating the psychotic Pamela Voorhees (Nada Visitor), who blames her for the death of her son, Jason, who drowned in the lake years earlier. Fast forward to present day and a group of friends, including Whitney (Righetti), Wade (Jonathan Sadowski) and the extremely irritating Richie (Ben Feldman), arrive near the abandoned site of Camp Crystal Lake, where the previous murders took place, in search of marijuana. Around a campfire that night, Wade tells the legend of Pamela's vengeful killing spree and Jason's return from the grave, which clearly convinces no one. Soon after, Whitney and her boyfriend, Mike (Nick Mennell), decide to take a walk when they stumble upon the old camp. Ill-advised, they take a look around where they discover a necklace with a photo of Pamela, which Mike mentions has an uncanny resemblance to Whitney.So has Friday The 13th 2009 lived up to the hype, well in my opinion it has, even though there are a few flaws most of the characters are one-dimensional and spout cringe-worthy dialogue, and they are too catered to the standard stereotype formula to be either convincing or sympathetic. But there are some good performances like Jared Padelecki (Jensen Ackles co star of Supernatural) makes a convincing and likable leading man and resoureful even and Amanda Righetti, to a lesser extent, also makes a good effort, though sadly she spends the majority of the running time manacled in an underground tunnel so there is very little room for character development. By far the star of the show is Jason – as it should be - and thankfully Mears proves to be one of the best, or at the very least one of the most intimidating Jasons yet. Whilst Hodder brought the role to a whole new level there were always a few errors with regards to the character – he always caught his prey without running and in Friday the 13th Part 8: Jason Takes Manhattan it seems that he could even teleport, as there is no other explanation as to how he managed to be in two places at once. Yet here these problems are rectified, Jason can run and, using his underground tunnels, he can appear from nowhere. Mears plays the role with an intensity and level of aggression that has not been seen for many years and certainly wipes all memory of Kirzinger away.The other decision the filmmakers chose which really pays off is returning Jason to Crystal Lake. It has been over twenty years since he last spent an entire film at this infamous location – instead opting to explore New York, Hell and even twenty-fifth century deep space. Fans will have fun pointing out all the various references to the previous films and books (from plot points to character names), though you should not let this distract you from the movie itself.All in all Friday 2009 is a successful remake and takes Jason back to his 1980's glory and hopefully starts a new line of Friday The 13th movies for the new millennium.",Friday the 13th
115,Darkside-Reviewer,Hard Pass!,4,7 January 2021,"The Friday the 13th series is one of the most influential slasher movie franchises ever made to this day. The original Friday the 13th movie was released into theatre's in 1980 and quickly became one of the most successful and controversial horror movies ever made. The series later became famous for it's continuous sequels that were released into theatre's almost every year throughout the 1980s. The rights to the series were then sold by Paramount to New Line Cinema who also owned the rights to The Nightmare On Elm Street series. Jason then appeared in three more movies (Jason Goes To Hell - The Final Friday) (1993) then in (Jason X) (2000) until he would face Freddy Kreuger in the ultimate slasher movie crossover ever made (Freddy Vs Jason) (2003). The Friday the 13th franchise pretty much died after that with no more movies being made within the original series continuity.Then in 2009 producers decided to make one last ditch effort to rob fans of their hard earned money by making a Friday the 13th reboot. I unfortunately was one of the many people who paid money to go see this movie on it's opening day back in 2009. I will admit I never for a moment thought that this was going to be a good movie. I was honestly hoping there would at least be a few good death scenes that would take advantage of modern day special effects and CGI. Instead all we got out of this movie was definitive proof that the Friday the 13th was officially dead and buried at least for another decade or so.The story for this movie if you can call it that feels rushed and poorly written with characters so mind numbingly stupid and unlikeable they make 80s slasher movie characters look dignified by comparison. The movie has a few subtle nods to the original series.The look and style they went with for Jason Voorhees character in this movie is very similar to the look he has in Freddy Vs Jason. I would describe Jason's look in this movie as hillbilly Jason he has that look about him like he belongs in a Texas Chainsaw Massacre movie not a Friday the 13th movie.The thing I hate the most about this movie is just how dark it is and I don't mean that as in the movies tone is dark, gritty and gory. I mean the movie is visually dark even in scenes that take place during the day they purposely darkened all the movies backgrounds making every scene look like it was shot on a cheap video camera. All the death scenes and scenes with Jason in them are shot this way in almost complete darkness so you can hardly see Jason's mask or face. All the gore is spoiled when you can't see the blood due to the dark background and fast camera movement. I have since watched the movie on Blu Ray and even on Blu Ray the movie looks dark and shadowy. This may sound like a petty complaint but this movie was made in 2009 the effects and camerawork should be better than a movie made in 1980 on a budget of only $500.000 (USD).I really don't recommend watching this failed attempt at a series reboot just watch one the older better movies if your looking for a half decent slasher movie to waste an hour and a half on.",Friday the 13th
116,DonFishies,A whole lot of fun if you know what you are in for,7,13 February 2009,"Jason.The hockey mask.The machete.That ominous theme that sounds a lot like ""Kill, Kill, Kill."" Anyone with any knowledge of the horror genre has undoubtedly come across this villainous icon who practically sprayed theatres with blood throughout the 1980s. Although he pretty much became a parody of himself in Jason X and then was basically (and wrongly) turned into a psychologically tormented Frankenstein's Monster-style creature in Freddy vs. Jason, the beast was always remembered for who he originally was.And that is what makes the new remake/reimagining of Friday the 13th such a success (for the most part). Despite being written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, the same guys who brutalized Freddy vs. Jason, they wisely went back to the basics that made the character so popular. Sure, he runs now, but he is a hulking beast again. There is a bit of added development in the relationship Jason has with his mother, but the story remains the same. He is still taking revenge on sex-crazed teenagers stupid enough to want to camp on Crystal Lake.The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Halloween and to an extent, The Hills Have Eyes, all went down the route of making their deranged killers need to have parental issues in order to establish their motives as adults. For some reason, there seemed to need to be a reason for these killers to be the way they are. They simply could not exist as being demented and totally sick-in-the-head. Friday the 13th does not bother with any of that. Sure, there is a plot twist that will make any devotee or fan squirm with repulsion, but it still makes sense in the grand scheme of who Jason was and is now. The character has no added dimension completely taking away from how terrifying he is, and making him into a misunderstood infant. For that alone, the movie is more than worth the price of admission.Another wise choice is sticking to the formula. The filmmakers here (including director Marcus Nispel of Texas Chainsaw remake fame) have made what is basically an homage to the series. Instead of trying to completely redo and rebrand the character for a 2009 audience, the film amalgamates everything everyone loved about the series that made them come back for ten sequels. Remember the gratuitous amount of breasts and graphic sex scenes? They are here, and just as graphic as ever. Remember the goofy dialogue, and total lack of any knowledge shown by the characters in trying to combat themselves against this machete-wielding maniac? Its back too. And remember all those ridiculously violent kills? Well, they are back too.The film knows its genre, and it knows its audience. It throws plenty of cheap scares at a moment's notice, and offers just enough laughs (both intentional and unintentional) to keep the audience invested in the movie. And when the actual scares come, the film manages to keep the audience transfixed at those moments too (whether they are screaming in fear or laughing from how ridiculous the scene is). Rather tastefully, the deaths are gruesome, but not to the point of overkill like in the Saw series or even within The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Sure, there are some points where it may be hard not to wince, but it never seems like the filmmakers want to push the audience to the limit. They ground themselves in reality (for as real a situation as this story seems), and very rarely do they cross that barrier. They know which buttons they want to push, and which they want to stay well away from. And instead of exploiting the genre, they embrace it and somehow do not make things too disgusting for themselves. None of them may look innovative, but they work for the type of movie it is trying to be.But for all the praising, the film is obviously imperfect. Leaving aside the ridiculous twist in the middle of the film and the total lack of character development (albeit, totally expected, but upsetting nonetheless), the film drags its heels getting to the finale. There is a very dry spot as the film nears its third act that borders on boring, and seems more like a forced narrative device to stretch the running time out. I have more than enough faith to see that they clearly could have added more running and screaming to some scenes, and still could have gotten a better effect. Some scenes seem marred by trying to be tense and failing as well. But of course, it is pretty hard for a scene to be tense when you are cheering for the killer as opposed to the victim.The film also suffers from the slapdash editing that plagues modern horror and action films. In some instances, it is almost impossible to be scared because we barely see what is going on in the scene. It merely shows Jason show up, the person make their movie, and then a quick cut of what Jason does. Some scenes linger on the aftermath, but some happen and disappear quicker than you anyone would think. The fact that the film is not incredibly gory only makes it seem all the sillier to be so horrendously edited in some areas. Some of the actors could have tried a little harder too, but that is just a nitpicking gripe.In the end, Friday the 13th is a whole lot of fun. I did not think I would enjoy it at all, but I ended up being surprised at how reverent the film was to the series. Granted you know what to expect from a film featuring Jason Voorhees as the main character, than you should not go home disappointed.And coming from a remake, that is saying quite a lot.7/10.(An edited version of this review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).",Friday the 13th
117,ctomvelu-1,Jason Redux,7,14 February 2009,"Welcome back, Jason. The last time we saw him, in 2003's FREDDY VS JASON, he was walking out of Crystal Lake, machete in one hand and Freddy's head in the other. Cut to 2009, and we meet a group of callow youths headed for a wild weekend on Crystal Lake. But we also meet a young man (SUPERNATURAL'S Jared P.) searching for his sister who fell afoul of Jason awhile back. Not to give too much away, but before the title comes up, we are entertained with a 10- or 15-minute vignette involving a group of moronic campers who end up on the wrong end of Jason's machete. This is before the main plot begins, and it is a wonderful recreation of a typical Jason movie of the past. The movie is in fact a bona fide sequel, not some half-baked reworking or makeover of the Jason saga. The one big difference is Jason himself, who moves at the speed of lightning. No one, and I mean no one, can outrun him. The killings are only slightly gory, with a lot of quick cuts away at crucial moments. But there is one killing, involving a nerdy type who gets it in the throat, and which is shown in long and loving detail. And extreme closeup. The movie has precious little character development, and we really don't care about most of the victims. So what else is new in a Jason flick? The audience I saw this with was rooting for Jason the whole time. Wouldn't you? This turns out to be a nice homage to the existing series, showing great respect to the long-running series we all love. And the ending is a very nice tweak of the ending of the original film. Very respectful, Mr. Nispel, who also gave us a great Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE remake a few years back. There is absolutely no question, based on the quality of this movie, that we will be seeing yet another Jason sequel one of these days soon",Friday the 13th

Jason this time is not a slow killer (something new) and he is very angry. The cinematography is very atmospheric and the performances are fine, Jared Padalecki is a good actor. The death scenes are gory and the film is funny! The original film is a low budget masterpiece, a classic, this remake is just a funny movie.",Friday the 13th
119,RussHog,Horrible writers,1,26 August 2018,The people who wrote this are terrible writers. Some of the most pathetic work I have ever experienced. The same writer duo messed up Baywatch. How do you make Baywatch even worse? There are ten thousand episodes of bad Baywatch and they actually wrote a movie that was worse. They made this disaster too. Pathetic.,Friday the 13th
120,LoneWolfAndCub,"Not as good as the original, but still an entertaining remake",6,13 April 2009,"Marcus Nispel's 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake was darker, grittier and bloodier than Tobe Hooper's original. This is also the case for his remake of Sean S. Cunningham's original, low-budget slasher flick. The style and tone in this movie is much darker and grittier than in the original, which in my opinion was more light-hearted. Now, this does not make it better than the original, but I found it worked in some ways (and less in others). Realistically though, this is pretty much the same as the eleven other (yes, I'm including Freddy Vs. Jason) F13th movies. Teens camp in woods near Crystal Lake, Jason is nearby and angry, teens have sex, smoke weed...and get sliced to bits.This is probably useless, but I will provide a brief outline of the story because it is the right thing to do. Clay Miller (Jared Padelecki) is searching for his sister Whitney (Amanda Righetti), who is missing and was last at Camp Crystal Lake. At this Camp awhile back, Mrs. Voorhees went on a murderous rampage to avenge her son's (Jason) ""death."" A counselor beheads her, and poor Jason had to witness the whole thing. Clay happens to bump into a group of ragamuffins staying in a nice house by the lake. Soon enough Jason is there to wreck havoc on the unsuspecting teens and locals.Now, that plot synopsis will probably sound familiar to those who have seen the many F13th flicks where Jason hacks and slashes his way through the cast albeit one or two heroes. This movie will be familiar to them when they hear the infamous theme (""Ki Ki Ki Ma Ma Ma""), see the hockey mask donned, see the nudity followed by death. Essentially, this is a pretty standard remake, not straying too far from the original. However, there is a twist (which I will not spoil), which shows that this re-telling is trying to do something different, which I think is admirable. Although I do not necessarily think it is the greatest, it was nice to see it was not a complete rehash. As mentioned earlier, this is darker and grittier, but unfortunately that did not affect the deaths, which apart from one or two weren't particularly memorable. This definitely can not hold a candle to the many outrageously cool demises the other F13th movies have. Furthermore, Jason does run in this, but this is good (as many should remember he ran in the Parts 2 - 4 before he becomes the zombie he is now associated with) as technically Nispel has remade the first three movies in this one. Friday the 13th (1980) is reduced to 5 minutes during the credits. Part 2 (1981) is the next 20 minutes, and then Part 3 (1982) is referenced when Jason gains his hockey mask in a barn.Surprisingly, the acting is actually good from all the cast (especially Derek Mears as Jason, he is great), unfortunately their characters are not developed in the slightest. Seriously, they are all clichéd and most die before we get to know one thing about them. There is the token Asian guy, Black guy, sluts, jocks and the nice girl. Of course, I also need to mention that the movie is predictable but I mean, it is a Friday the 13th remake, you can not expect any less. Honestly, this is not a bad movie at all, it is just good. It delivers everything a Friday the 13th should do and it does it well, the only reason it is not great is it lacks the ""oomph"" of the others. The deaths don't have the yuck factor, the characters are boring and it feels kind of flat. But hey, enjoy it for what it is! 3/5",Friday the 13th
121,the-movie-guy,This hockey-mask wearing stalker Jason will not disappoint you,6,10 February 2009,"(Synopsis) Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) travels to Crystal Lake, the last known location that his missing sister Whitney (Amanda Righetti) was seen. The police have searched with no luck, and Clay is searching alone. Local citizens have advised Clay not to go into those woods, because anyone who shows up missing is already dead, and he is wasting his time. Their warnings go unheard, because he must find and rescue his sister. During the search, Clay meets a group of thrill-seeking college students who have just arrived at Crystal Lake for a weekend of sex, booze and pot smoking. One of the students, Jenna (Danielle Panabaker) decides to help Clay find his sister, and they go into the woods. They find the abandoned Camp Crystal Lake and search the dilapidated camp house for any signs of his sister. They soon see why people don't come to these woods, because they encounter the evil and psychopathic killer, Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears).(My Comment) This is your typical teen slasher horror movie. By now, everybody should know that you don't enter the haunted domain of Jason, or you deserve what you get. We now have a bigger and stronger Jason who hunts his prey and not only uses his razor-sharp machete, but other instruments to carry out his nightmarish revenge. There are some terrifying scares scenes that made me jump, luckily there was no one sitting next to me. If you like slasher movies, the hockey-mask wearing stalker Jason will not disappoint, and you will have a bloody good time as Jason increases his body count. I was glad when it was over, because I couldn't take much more of this traumatic experience. (Warner Bros., Run Time 1:37, Rated R)(6/10)",Friday the 13th
122,asda-man,Jason's back to his day job,7,2 November 2011,"I'm not a die hard ""Friday The 13th"" fan, don't get me wrong I do enjoy them but probably don't adore them as much as some people which is probably why I was able to just sit back and really enjoy this impressive remake. I'm a fan of slasher films which is probably why this film tickled my fancy because I was sort of expecting another ""Prom Night"" made for TV sort of feel and I did get a little bit hasty with the naff beginning with Bobble Head standing there repeating all her lines from the original film, but after I got past that I realised I was looking at a pretty fine looking slasher film.The cinematography struck me the most, with the opening shots of the lake looking particularly beautiful as well as some lovely sunsets. But this isn't some picturesque ""Margaret's Museum""! And so at times, especially in the dark scenes (which is pretty much the whole film) it was hard to see what was going on, and every now and then we couldn't exactly see the whole death scene because the editing got too frantic and the camera got too shaky but that didn't bother me too much.""Friday The 13th"" makes quite a bold opening as it decides to spend 20 minutes or so crafting and actual opening. Whilst in most slasher films we'd get an opening of about 1 minute with one kill, here we get a whole group of people who could quite easily be the main characters and we see them get slaughtered. The ""main"" body of the film that follows is basically an extended version of what we've just witnessed but guess what? We're watching a film with Jason. There aren't going to be too many plot twists or clever writing, we're going to get plenty of kills and fans of slashers will certainly be satisfied.The kills in ""Friday The 13th"" really do not put the original's to shame. They're original, bloody and highly entertaining (I don't mean that in some weird sick way). The film is injected with life the whole way through which means there isn't much boring talky teen angst dialogue but more running away from the big J. I like how it didn't try to appeal to 13 year olds at sleep overs like ""Prom Night"" but it actually tried to appeal to proper horror fans because ""Friday The 13th"" is truly horrific, with a really thrilling finale.It's a shame that we didn't see much character building, but I wasn't really expecting any to be quite honest with you (said like Pasquale). But the kids weren't entirely unlikable, they were unlikable don't get me wrong, but I didn't hate them with a passion like in most slasher remakes. It's also a shame that they felt the need to spice things up with a bit of nudity or a few sex scenes because we aren't here to see some weird pornographic film (I should hope :S) and it's really demeaning to the actors. I know they're not the best actors in the world but I'm sure they have more interesting things to show (like feelings) rather than their breasts.But, obviously it isn't going to be a perfect slasher film, but it is however a highly entertaining one. The screenplay is quite funny at times, the death scenes are great and it doesn't get boring. It's full of thrills and I think they've done Jason proud.

123,LazySod,A sad day for slasher horror,4,2 March 2009,"In 1980 the first Friday the 13th film was made. In 1980 I was 9 years old so I am pretty sure I didn't see it right away but I did see it, some-when during the great VHS revolution where films just like it came by the cart wagon. As the series grew longer and the steady decline in quality started I moved away from it and eventually forgot all about it. Then came Freddy Vs. Jason in 2005 and there was a short-lived revival of the theme. And it died again. Now, in 2009 another attempt is done. Jason is back. And to complete the theatrical effects, the film was released on February, Friday 13th. At least at my end of the Earth.Does it live up to the original or even the best bits of the series? No it doesn't. Not by a long shot. No need to re-cap the stories - it's the same one as the first two films combined, or maybe only the first film - it's been ages since I saw those so the mind is a little foggy there. Either way - the film fails to be fun (like some of todays slasher films that do work out) and fails to be gruesome and terrific (like a good horror film should be). So, it fails to be interesting.That in itself is the main reason this film is bad. The fact that the most characters are flat as the paper they were written down on doesn't help, but doesn't make it worse - it's not like the original films character had much on their mind. The events that happen are the blame - it's just too little and not clearly pointed anywhere.4 out of 10 machetes swinging",Friday the 13th
124,suspiria10,Friday the 13th (2009),7,16 February 2009,"Director: Marcus NispelStars: Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Amanda Righetti, Derek Mears Synopsis: A group of college kids take a break from their usual drunken debauchery to take a trip up to one of the group's parent's cabin by the lake. Unfortunately for them it's Crystal Lake, the notorious stomping grounds of the illustrious Jason Voorhees.Thoughts: It was inevitable that old hockey puck would be remade. Jason never stayed dead in the movies (10 installments previously unless you count 'Freddy vs. Jason as #11) so why did anyone ever think the series would just quietly drift into the night. The 'F13' series was easy enough to emulate. Attractive people partying hard and suffering the consequences at the hands of moralities hit-man (ol' hockey mask himself}. The series was never clear on its trajectory and as long as there was stalking and slashing the fans were content. Now nearly 30 years later the formula is dusted off and served up to the 'Saw' generation. Director Nispel once again teams up with the Platinum Dunes group (of which Michael Bay is a part of) after their successful and decent re-launching of another beloved classic 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. The screenplay which is essential 'Friday the 13th part 2' with element of parts 3 and 4 thrown in for good measure hits all cylinders with ample nubile naked flesh and enough stalk and slash to keep that 'Saw' generation engaged. However some adjustments have been made to the Jason character that has many of the die hard old-schoolers moaning. Yeah we knew they had to give pathos and humanize (ever so minutely) the big bad Jason but adding new wrinkles like running, kidnapping and intelligence in a film like this is the equivalent of screen doors on a submarine. But all the minor snipping aside and you get a better than average remake that doesn't skimp on the goods and doesn't absolutely blaspheme the original.

Even still Friday' fans will find much to enjoy in this splashy, well-made slasher flick. The film makes no pretensions, it's a slasher film and acts like one too! The action arrives hard and fast, with bloody brutal kill sequences and some intense chase scenes. There's also a dash of dark humor (and plenty of topless actresses) thrown in for good measure.So I can't complain that there's little character development or that the movie is riddled with clichés and stereotypes because this film is wise enough to dispense with the myriad BS and get to the elements that Friday' fans enjoy.

How many times do they have to take a franchise that has been stretched to the max, and do a remake? It very rarely works and in this case, it failed.As if I really have to tell you what this film is about A deformed serial killer is on the loose around his home next to a lake, and everyone that goes near there ends up dead.I was told that this is a remake, but I completely disagree that this is. I would just call it yet another sequel. If you have seen the original movie, you will know that Jason is not in it. Jason was not the original killer of the franchise. Jason took over in Part 2. In this 'remake' Jason is the killer.I love slasher movies. I love nothing more than turning out the lights late at night and watching a gory horror movie. This film has some great killings. Jason holds no punches in this and that is great. He goes after everyone and causes a lot of bloodshed along the way. The deaths and effects were well done. It looked great and the blood and gore was awesome. The movie didn't take long to get into. It started out quickly and continued throughout with a steady death toll.The acting was terrible! The first 20 minutes of the movie was just the intro into the film. There were a group of characters that went camping in the woods until they came up against Jason you ca tell what is going to happen next. The problem is, the people they killed off at the beginning of the movie were the best actors in the film. I actually thought they did a great job but when the main characters came into the movie it all went downhill from there. They all had parts in it that I thought were bad. The movie stars Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Amanda Righetti, Travis Van Winkle & Aaron Yoo. Now, it was not the worst acting I have ever seen but there was definitely room for improvement. Jason Voorhees was played by Derek Mears. Probably the best main character actor in the film. And that is the guy who wears a mask and hacks people up.The movie is alright as long as you don't expect a really kick ass remake. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake was good, the Nightmare on Elm Street remake was awesome but unfortunately the Friday The 13th remake was just average.There were some great killing as I said before, but there really was nothing new. Everything in this has been made before a million times over in every other horror film. But for mindless gore and people running and screaming before they come to the end of their short lives this film does hit all the marks.I did enjoy it so for that reason I will give this film 6 out of 10.""In my next life, I wanna come back as one of the buttons on the ass pockets of her jean shorts.""For more reviews, please like my Facebook page:https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl",Friday the 13th
129,mcfly-31,almost a decent fan-film....,5,16 February 2009,"The original Camp Blood is near and dear to me, even for a horror series. Never was much of a Mike Myers fan, Freddy had a couple good flicks. But the Jason series just had this mystique about it, this atmosphere. From the setting, to the uniqueness of the murders, the lore of Jason's tragedy, and most of all, the music. The fact that they got these elements to work together so well for so long (the first six original Fridays) was an accomplishment in itself for a slasher series. To find out that most of the above mentioned nuances would not be incorporated into this ""reboot"", had me going in with lowered expectations.There is no camp. There are no counselors. Hell, there are nary a handful of ""ki-ki-ki, ma-ma-mas"". Unfortunately, any remake/reboot is going to modernize the hell out of any original film, and that's what we get here. About five interchangeable blonde (well, one brunette) bimbos with fake breasts (okay, there was one set of real knockers) who appear to be all of 16 years old. Two hunky ""heroes"" right off a magazine cover, the token black guy who actually acknowledges he's the token black guy, an Asian wiseacre/nerd, and yes...even a Seth Rogen pothead. Throw in about ten metric tonnes of marijuana, and you have ""Friday the 13th - Jason Takes The OC"".Okay, the core of the film. The lore of Jason's mother is rushed in an opening sequence, followed by the usual introduction of the potentially lovable victims. But here is the film's first mis-step: after these people are skewered, we are intro'd to a SECOND cast! I just got used to a crop of chowderheads whose little barbs and personalities were starting to grow on me, and now along comes another?? Complete with screenwriter one-liners and heightened hormones. I guess everyone in the area has taken their turn at the local comedy club's open mic.Fatal flaw 2: yes, I can attempt to embrace modernizing, but the fact that the writers think this means that WEED, WEED, WONDERFUL WEED should be as big a factor as Jason, became stale VERY fast. Talk about the wrong kind of overkill for a Friday movie.Mistake 3: no one is the least bit sympathetic, the ""heroine"" is a girl who disappears for an hour of the film, and the ending is not only seen a mile away, but is slightly incomplete. Not to mention the amoral hillbilly (redundant?) who has confoundingly found his way into the vicinity of this ritzy mountain community.I assume I should try and drop some positives in at this point. The kills are relatively inventive and fun. Some are stunners, some are groaners, and at least only two are of the torture variety. A big turn-off of the last few Friday films had been having Jason cause his victims lingering, agonizing deaths. Here, he mostly pops up behind you and puts your lights out quick. He even knows his demographic, as one girl is impaled through the head, then raised from the water long enough to reveal her tit-job for a beat.The ""comedy"" in the film is almost too good, that it doesn't seem it belongs in this movie. The sex jokes and macho zingers were usually a scattered bonus in the other entries. Here they're poured on a little thick.The cast is decent, as lead Padalecki had the look and intensity of a young Patrick Swayze, with Panabaker a good Danielle Harris clone. Van Winkle overplays the given jerk, but nets the flick's hugest laugh when a body is dropped in front of him. My theater broke into big-time applause and titters from that moment.A large credit must be paid to Derek Mears as Jason. He brings a perfect physicality and body-language to the part, that reminded me a lot of Richard Brooker's Jason of Part III. Even down to the make-up, which has an old-school, fleshy-necked, bald Jason. As opposed to the stringy-haired ""fat"" Jason of Part IX, and the Donald Duck-masked, hulking man/machine of Jason X.All told this comes off like a competently made fan film, so many of which have permeated the internet the last 10 years. Nispel's jarring, ""Blair Witch""-like camera movements were an extreme distraction, and again, the lack of Harry Mandredini's masterful score is a major drawback (here, let's throw a few more hundred CLANGS on the soundtrack for effect).Jason's hayday may have come and gone, but though not alive and well, he's at least alive and passable.",Friday the 13th
130,acedj,"Not great, not terrible",7,11 November 2019,"It seems to me that the makers of this movie could not decide if they wanted to make a reboot, or remake. There are a lot of elements of the first three or four movies in this one. None of that detracts from the fact that this is probably the best film in the franchise since The Final Chapter. Solid cast and direction, with a different side of Jason being shown.",Friday the 13th
131,PedroPires90,"One of the best, better than the original",8,19 August 2021,"There are only 2 reasons why some people don't put this one among the best of this series:1. Nostalgia is a drug and you remember how you felt while you were watching the old movies, not their quality, but your youth and your feelings at that time.2. Those people have never watched all the previous films.This ends my F-13 Marathon (didn't rewatch Freddy vs Jason at the moment, as I want to do it after rewatching all the Elm Street films) and I can definitely say that this is one of my favourites alongside Part 2 and Part 6 (Jason Lives). All of them are very different, with different vibes, but they work very well on their own. Maybe on my next rewatch, I can decide between them.Neither of them is a perfect film but this is a fun franchise and surprisingly I gave 4 stars to 4 movies (also gave that to the first one, a bit inferior, but the beginning everything!).This is a much serious film than Part 2 or, especially, Part 6, it's much more adapted to the current days, but it's also more tense and intense. I have seen some people complaining about the sex scenes...maybe there is one too many, but this franchise was always about that: stupid kids, boobs and blood. Maybe my only complaint is that we had too many fake boobs on this one. 🤔Overall, I think this reboot is a great film by it's own and also a great homage to different films of the series. Would like to see a bit more love for this, but I believe that, in the next years, as people will be rewatching all of them, this will start to be much more loved.",Friday the 13th
132,hellholehorror,Antihero,7,16 November 2018,"Ignoring the confusing title, I am treating this as a sequel, reminds us what happened in the first film and kind of ignores the sequels but doesn't totally discount them. This has the Cabin Fever (2002) effect with unlikable characters that you really want to die and maybe the odd one that you relate to. This works well for Friday the 13th as Jason is the antihero that you root for to kill the repugnant teens. There were a few moments that were jarring, like when Jason was just standing on the roof, this section didn't really make sense. This film doesn't change the formula of the original, it doesn't try to do anything different, and this is why I like it! The series lost its way and became a joke, the original 4 films were the best and this fits in well with the original 4. On a technical front this is perfect looking and sounding. Violence is brutal but not gory enough for me. Jason is badass and back (if only for one short movie).",Friday the 13th
133,ofumalow,"It's what you'd expect, no better or worse",4,15 April 2018,"This is pretty much what you'd expect from producer Michael Bay and director Marcus Nispel (whose 2003 ""Texas Chainsaw"" revamp wasn't bad at all, but there's not much to say for his films since, including the ""Conan the Barbarian"" remake): It's slick, loud, has a lot of action, no interesting ideas or individual style, and is watchable but just not very good-in short, an acceptable time-waster you probably won't even remember whether you saw in a year or two. It feels more generic than some of the original ""Friday"" films, even though it's better produced than most were. Here we get a brief prologue of the (restaged) first film's ending, then what seems like the very hasty dispatch of a new set of modern-day victims-but it turns out they comprise just ANOTHER prologue, and the ""real"" story starts twenty-odd minutes in and six weeks later. Now we've got yet more nubile young campers on the chopping block, this group slightly more differentiated by virtue of being including a black guy, an Asian guy, and a gay guy, plus the usual blonde babes and alpha male jerk rich kid who owns the deluxe country ""cabin"" where they're spending the weekend. Not traveling with them is the brother of a missing girl whom we know didn't make it past the first reel. We also meet a few of the local rubes, who are mean toward outsiders and thus deserve their own grisly fates. In addition, we briefly see Jason after he loses a hood and before he finds a hockey mask. He is not pretty, but it really seems a bigger deal should be made of his unmasking than this movie bothers with. The script doesn't really replicate the first film's narrative, such as it was, but neither does it come up with any notable updates beyond the news that the woods around old Camp Crystal Lake are now full of illegal marijuana-itself a more recent horror cliche. (Like sex, you covet the weed, you're gonna die.) The deaths are violent, natch, but rather perfunctory, as if Nispel weren't all that interested-but come on, what's the point of making a ""Friday the 13th"" movie if you're not going to make the deaths spectacular? I guess you could say ""To expand upon the mythology/backstory,"" but this movie doesn't make the least effort in that direction. If anything, Nispel's ""Friday"" de-mythologizes Jason to no obvious benefit, as we eventually see way too much of him, and have to accept the far-fetched notion that he's simply been living in the abandoned camp for nearly four decades undetected while people frequently disappear forever in the area. Yet as before, he's here, he's there, he's everywhere without ever making a noise, like the semi-supernatural Jason of yore. There's a bit of a ""Texas Chainsaw"" vibe to the fact that we realize Jason sometimes keeps victims alive for a while in the catacombs beneath a cabin, but no explanation whatsoever why. This being a Michael Bay joint, there is some routine loutish humor and Hooters-level ogling. I'm pretty sure if someone actually came up with a script that exploited T&A but was actually kinda clever about it, he'd say ""That's too smart for my audience."" (No, you're underestimating your audience.)This movie is well-shot and energetic with OK performances, but I'm pretty sure at some point in the near future I won't even be able to remember whether I saw it, or am simply confusing it with some other horror sequel/reboot.",Friday the 13th
134,nitzanhavoc,A great addition for all you Jason fans out there!,7,21 November 2020,"Friday the 13th. The legendary Jason, the hockey-mask wearing machete virtuoso, the maestro of slash whose trademark woosh-woosh-woosh ha-ha-ha theme music has been the Horror soundtrack of generations. This is really what this film is all about, another taste of Jason and a respectful homage to the classic Slasher of the 80s. In my opinion, it isn't a remake at all, more of a late addition to the long anthology.If this is your first encounter with FT13, you're in for a guilty pleasure. The plot is as logical as any urban legend, the characters ridiculously stereotypical and too stupid to live, and of course there's the occasional unnecessary sex scene in full nudity in case anyone mistook this for a serious film. The thing is - this is what Slasher films are all about. All these shortcomings serve to make the antagonist all the more stupendous, terrifying and too awesome for words. By the middle of the film you'll be rooting for that guy.In all honesty, I think I would have enjoyed this film even without being a devout Jason fan (though it definitely would have made me one as, like I've said, sheer awesome). Some of the characters are actually quite relatable (the main plot revolves around a guy trying to find out what happened to his sister, so you know, you're all like ""good for you man, I hope you don' die a gruesome awesome death""). The acting isn't terrible (albeit far from impressive) and the cinematography really does its part in emphasizing how huge yet dexterous Jason is.So, if you're a fan of the original films, you simply have to watch this, if only for the sake of having your condescending catharsis while criticizing it for being as good as the original. If this is indeed your first time - I would recommend looking for the original films before you dive into the tribute. Jason rules, had to say it again. He does.",Friday the 13th
135,Rautus,Jason is Back,7,19 February 2009,"Friday the 13th (2009)Directed by: Marcus Nispel Story by: Damian Shannon & Mark Swift and Mark Wheaton Screenplay by: Damian Shannon & Mark Swift Based on Characters Created by: Victor Miller Review: Jason Voorhees, the Iconic Killer who's been slashing countless victims in Crystal Lake, Manhatten, Space and even Elm Street is finally back five years later after we last saw the Hockey Mask wearing maniac butchering people in Freddy Vs Jason.There was talk of a Freddy Vs Jason sequel but it never developed on the screen but instead on paper in the four part comic book series Freddy Vs Jason Vs Ash.In 2009 the people who bought us The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake bring us the Friday the 13th reboot and I must say it's nice to see Jason back on the Silver Screen again.Friday the 13th does have it fair share of flaws but even with them the film was still entertaining especially if you don't take them seriously and just enjoy the film for what it is, a homage to the Friday the 13th movies and I must admit I had fun spotting the references.Lovers of gore will enjoy some of the death scenes in this movie such as the dock scene.The movie also has some great atmosphere with the lack of lighting and gritty tone, similar to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning.Jason himself looks mean and intimidating, one little disappointment is that they have all this make up on the actor and they only show Jason's face once in a very quick and brief scene (Similar to Jason X where you only get to see one shot of his face) while in the previous Friday the 13th movies (Except for Friday the 13th: A New Beginning since Jason isn't the killer) Jason's face is only shown once in the film but the filmmakers let you get a good look at it apart from Jason goes to Hell and Freddy Vs Jason where you hardly see his face.The acting in Friday the 13th is okay and the gore effects are pretty good.Plot: On Friday the 13th 1980 a young woman is being chased by a psychopath intent on getting revenge after her son Jason drowned in the Lake, coming face to face with the Killer the young woman slices off her head and escapes. The young boy Jason thought to have drowned in the Lake walks to his mom's body talking a locket and the Machete used to decapitate her.Years later a group of Teenagers looking for some fun in the woods soon find themselves being attacked by a fully grown Jason wearing a sack over his face.Six weeks later another group of teenagers are going into the woods for a bit of fun, on there way to the house they stop at a store where one young man is searching for his sister who's been missing after going into the woods with her friends.The teenagers reach the house, the young man searching for his sister meets with one of the teenagers and she agrees to help him look for her. Little do they realise that his sister is being held captive by Jason who thinks of her as his Mother.Soon the teenagers find themselves being killed by Jason and it's only a matter of time before the two remaining survivors go into Jason's hideout and the young man discovers his sister. Then they must escape and try and stop Jason once and for all but can the psychotic madman be stopped? Overall:Friday the 13th isn't a masterpiece but it is a entertaining reboot to the classic Slasher movie series that's definitely worth watching, just sit back and enjoy the ride.",Friday the 13th

When the movie started my heart was literally pounding so heard in my chest,that I think everybody in the theater heard it.When the movie was over,I was blown away!I haven't seen a movie this awesome since Planet Terror.The death scenes were very creative and Jason Delivered a powerful performance.What are you waiting for?Go see it already if you haven't.",Friday the 13th

It wasn't, however.Instead I have mixed feelings about this movie. I liked it as a modern horror and even as an installment of the Friday the 13th series. However, if this is supposed to be a remake of the original, I wasn't all that impressed.The acting wasn't good, but I didn't expect it to be. The characters weren't likable, as I expected. The story was predictable, as expected.The music was good in some parts, lousy in others.The kills for the most part were good.

People need to stop the movie-hate, we should hate each other instead.So, the movie. This is a really entertaining slasher movie. It has everything we want. Teens, drugs, boobs and kills. Jason is looking very good in this, and although he is a bit more human-like, (than in the later sequels in the series) I think he looks just like he is supposed to. Big, buff and dirty!Yes, there are some slight changes to the character of Jason Voorhees, but come on people, we can handle some slight changes. He is a bit quicker than before, but I think it really fits with the mood of the movie.This is exactly how I think a Friday the 13th-remake should be.

140,xamtaro,"When ""faithful to the original"" may be a mistake",7,14 October 2009,"When you get down to the nitty gritty of this movie, the remake of Friday the 13th really seems to be specifically catering to existing fans of the genre. It takes EVERYTHING synonymous with 80s slasher movies and ups the ante on them. A huge pity that ""everything"" also includes the flaws of such slasher genre films such as annoying teenage characters, too much sex and a less than adequate story.For starters, I have watched all the Friday the 13th movies except part 5 and i can safely say this movie is pretty faithful to the spirit of the Friday the 13th franchise. However, im sorry to say, that means the story is clichéd and stale to the core. Instead of doing something new with the franchise, it falls back on standard slasher movie re-threads. As usual, we follow a bunch of horny/idiotic teenagers who come to the lakeside for whatever silly reason, and then get hunted down and picked off one at a time by a crazed serial killer.I liked how the story jumped straight into the action for the first 20 minutes or so starting with the death of Jason's mother and then Jason's attack on a bunch of campers many years later which would then lead into the story proper of Clay(played by the star of the ""Supernatural"" TV series Jared Padalecki) looking for his sister who went missing at camp crystal lake. But other than that, there is hardly an interesting story to speak of.OK, story ain't going to hold an audience, but how about the characters? Also no.All of them are your usual horror movie stock characters who are just there to provide eye candy until they die. Even the character of Clay, who could have been developed into a mildly interesting character, falls flat. Almost all of them are portrayed in such a terrible light that one would actually WANT Jason to kill them off just to prove Darwin's theory of survival of the fittest(or in this case extinction of the silliest). The actors(mostly culled from TV series) seem to do try their best, but a mediocre script ruins everything.Well, at least for a horror film it has to be scary right? wrong! There is not a single scare or even a shock in this entire film!!Story, characters and ""scare factor"" are a no go.......so why am i not giving this movie a 2/10 right away?? I'll tell why. This movie is saved a cruel and unnecessary bad rating thanks to how enjoyable it was. For starters, the film looks great, easily the best looking horror movie i've seen. Slick camera-work, a dark gloomy but crisp lighting style and some creative directing skills bring out the greatest most in every single kill scene. Though the kills are not spectacular in any way, they are quite realistically played out and will more likely cause a reaction of ""holy crap!"" than a scream of terror from the audience.The second ""saving grace"" of the film is the Jason Voorhees character himself. Face it, Jason in the previous Friday the 13th movies was a goofy looking retard who then became a dim witted, lumbering Zombie freak. THIS new Jason(played by Derek Mears) actually feels more threatening for a change. He plans his kills, he baits his victims, he strikes with uncanny precision; more like a savage, driven mad man than a retard.If anything, Friday the 13th 2009 delivers the fundamental desire of any fan of slasher films: watching people getting dispatched in the most horrific and gruesome ways. It is sheer escapism and it blatantly focuses on that aspect while disregarding all others, for better or for worse. There came a point in the movie when i actually started rooting FOR Jason to make his next kill. I bet the producers were like, ""Silly teenager characters with little development? All the more reason to want them to be killed off! Story?? Who needs story?! Just think up some shenanigans for them to go through until the next on gets killed.""all in all, Friday the 13th 2009 is no where near the standard of a ""good movie"". Merely good for 106 minutes of violent escapism. It adheres too much to the blandness of the original films but manages to takes things up a notch; Better kills, a slick new look, a clear directing style, an improved re-imaging of Jason. Heck there is even not just one, but two sex scenes to please the hot blooded male audience. Sadly, Friday the 13th fell back too much on its franchise's staples, failing to carve a fresh new identity of its own and ultimately it tipped over into mediocrity.It is violent and fun in a sick escapist sort of way, but fails as a ""horror"" show due to its lack of scares. Maybe being too faithful to the original wasn't such a good idea afterall.",Friday the 13th
141,Mike_Devine,Stupendously awful,1,14 July 2018,"In an attempt to revive the aging slasher series, New Line Cinema and Paramount churned out 'Friday the 13th' (2009) during a period that was dominated by similar films that were targeted at young adults. With Marcus Nispel at the helm, we see what happens when more college-aged kids head back to Crystal Lake and encounter the masked man himself, Jason Voorhees. Of course, all hell breaks loose, etc.With 'Friday,' you really get what you pay for. Featuring a bunch of no-name TV actors (and what's Willa Ford doing in here?) and an assortment of gruesome deaths that feel like they were picked off a list of the ""100 worst ways to die,"" there's not a lot to champion here. The plot is a retread of every film from this genre ever made, no one is likable and there are enough scenes to make you roll your eyes enough times to go cross-eyed (including perhaps the worst use of the word ""stupendous"" ever).Nothing about 'Friday' is scary - it's just downright gross, and a reminder of the horrible movies that were released in the latter half of the previous decade.

Apart from this we have a bunch of stereotypes staying at a cabin the woods, our hero is a girl who is dating the biggest jerk on the planet, who sulks as she goes to help a stranger find his lost sister, and then has the longest sex scene I can remember seeing in a horror film with our resident harlot.The deaths scenes are suitably grisly, and this is not really a terrible movie.

I am also a fan of the Jason character and the overall mythos of the series. I was excited to see this reboot. I was very disappointed.The biggest issue is that the filmmakers lost what made the Jason character different than the other horror franchises. In this movie, Jason becomes more of a Jigsaw, Leatherface or one of the crazies from Wrong Turn than himself. It feels unrecognizable as a Friday the 13th movie except that they keep running underneath the Camp Crystal Lake sign.The story is also terrible. There are really two separate stories here.

And just like typical Michael Bay-produced horror movie, this one is also more about soft-core porn than it is a scarefest. A channel for today's struggling young hot stars to show off their stupendous boobs for the big screen and for talented actors to get gigs so they can pay for their dollar menu lunch.I was ready to keep my eyes and mind open to see if the movie has a certain ability to scare the sh*t out of the audience, and for a few moments at the beginning, it does exactly that. It's funny how even though the character Jason is considered retarded, for some odd reason, he can always come up with creative ways to kill his preys.. after a while you begin to wonder, if he's actually more brilliant than he looks. He shows up in one place and then vanishes into thin air and then appears in another place within a blink of an eye. The whole thing is laughable, I know he knows his way through the forest like the back of his hand but his flash superpower and ability to keep living after being killed is downright ridiculous. And some of the methods he uses are hilarious. He's supposed to be retarded and yet he's skilled at shooting arrows.. WTF! Who's the Mr. Miyagi that's been teaching him all these years!Gorgeous ladies in this movie, I can't say enough about the casting selection.

'gimme a break!' or 'get the F outta here!' Asian actor Aaron Yoo is supposed to be the comic-relief but he's too annoying, gross, and unlikeable.

It's a pretty and polished version of the original films but what it's lacking is any real tension and a good storyline. I'm sure that if you're a silly little teenager that liked the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, you'll love this movie, but there are those of us that ask for more than what this movie can give.Not for one second does this film make us care about its characters or its outcome. The casting obviously didn't require for anyone to be able to act, it just made sure that they would take off their clothes. There is no story, there is only slaughter. Also, forget about atmosphere or any sense of discomfort, you won't find it here. Marcus Nispel's Friday the 13th is a less scary version of The OC.Stay far away.

It's just another F13 movie. Neither remake nor sequel.If you thought the original movies were dumb (or any other 80s slasher movie, for that matter), you don't know what dumb is until you've seen this new one. Slasher movies in the 80s never tried to be ""hip and cool."" They were movies about a masked killer slaughtering stupid kids. That's it. These days, audiences apparently need pop culture references, smarmy dialog and the ""F"" word uttered at least ten times a minute in order to stay interested.There is not a single creative kill and very few interesting moments (a topless water skiing scene is one of the few moments that captures the spirit of the original series). Whatever Siskel & Ebert may have said about the slasher genre, even they would have to admit Jason came up with far more imaginative ways to kill his victims in the original series than in this boring, by-the-numbers, pointless redux.There's a few amusing nods to previous slasher movies (e.g. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Silent Night, Deadly Night), but outside of that and one or two other chuckles, this is yet another homogenized slasher movie. I suppose that's what audiences these days want.I can't believe this was written by the guys who wrote Freddy Vs Jason. That movie was much more fun, and much more true to its inspirations. And Marcus Nispel's pretty decent remake of Chainsaw was also as much a tribute to the original as a retelling of it. This movie is as dull and witless as a movie can be.I try to keep an open mind about remakes, but time and time again I'm disappointed. Somewhere along the way, Hollywood forgot how to make horror movies. If you don't believe that, check out the new Friday the 13th.",Friday the 13th
148,Cinema_Fan,Old flames that burn but never ignites the passion.,3,15 February 2009,"Marcus Nispel has been here before, finding his niche in the horror movie reboot market, we see once more, his sense of shock, horror, debauchery and screams delivered not by a rabid pack, as seen in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003), but by Victor Miller's lonely orphan boy turned serial killer, Jason Voorhees.While a reboot may be fitting the times, let us be honest here, it is not a new phenomenon to reproduce a movie to enlighten its flame to a new, fresh and contemporary audience. The 1980's Jason has travelled through time to reinvent himself and start anew, he's still a big fella and hiding behind his trademark Hockey mask and extra large machete still finds the time to make new friends and introduce them to his shiny, sharp, steel blade. Gruesomely lovely, any mother would be proud, but the premise is slanted slightly from the 1980's Jason, making them more distant cousins so to speak than close relatives.The more experienced Jason lovers here may, or may not, object to the rebooting of his name and the twenty-nine year gap (excluding the franchise for a moment and after all, this too, is the beginning of the rebirth of the Jason myth) may, or may not have done him harm. However, one has to ask the question concerning the inevitable, does it work? Are today's contemporary audience immune to the now passé, the now engraved, the now realised slasher cum stalker genre and its expectations? The last twenty-nine years has held onto the same premise and it is only the dressing of the narrative that keeps Jason alive and kicking. Jason wears his Hockey mask with zeal but he also wears his reboot crown with a vengeance. Does this mean-mother scare you to death? Well, I am slightly worried by the fact that he does and he is just as angry now as he was all those years ago.This menace of the woods and lake still finds it in his heart to do mothers bidding and with bad assed mothers such as Charles Kaufman's Mother's Day (1980) and Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960) to show how it's done also makes for a hell of a good ol' time. Well, that's how it's supposed to be, someone, regrettably, forgot to bring the party hats and trimmings.This reboot has its usual mêlée of heart-stoppers and squeamish anguish to race the pulse along, don't forget, Jason's a man with a blade and he knows how to use it, as this genre does so fittingly. It is not so much the back-story coming to life but at the forefront, it is a case of ""who ""really"" cares if these people die?"" It may be a trait of this genre to exclude any remorse for its (throwaway) victim, and very much excluding John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) from this theory. It is with pride, and it seems, that we now have the ultimate throwaway victim that would deem themselves fitting enough to be headlining the many poor and dismal parody movies seen of late. Hanna-Barbera Productions would be better off employing these fictitious film characters to better their development. It is not only amusing of the too simple one dimensional drive of the plot but do we really have to put up with the obnoxious and shallow ""zombie"" parodies? There're dead before they die. Strange too, that one would have the Sigma, the 18th letter of the Greek alphabet (S) on the back of ones four-by-four and turn out to be the dimmest candle in the box. A design of the genre, I agree, but it does not work in its favour, that it may be but an off-putting distraction to say the least here. Who cares? Not I. Jason, you'll be doing me a favour, and I thank you for it.Friday the 13th (2009) has its glorious moments and no doubt, we shall see more of this young man taking the streets of Manhattan at a later date, but personally, I think he needs to stay at home and develop his people skills. He's a nice young boy but he's also very predictable, I mean, it's not that hard to see what's coming. The killings are, but not all, interesting, and the characters are just too wishy-washy to give a hope for, it takes away the suspense and only weakens the perspective. The sex. The false boobs. The drug taking. Is this what the contemporary Slasher has to put-up with? Is this to be expected in this new, contemporary slasher rebooting? To appease the new audience? It never happened in the good ol' days, suggestive then it may have been, dull and boring what some may say of the suggestive stance of yesteryear, but it gave way to more respect for those who were about to die, ""leaving it to the imagination"" is what it's called, ah the good ol' days.Is it any wonder, then, that his, the Slasher / Stalker, victims are so easily caught, with all the knee-trembling going on and pollution in their minds, I'm surprised that any off them had the strength or energy to scream. I pity this new modern Killer, I almost feel for him, where's the bloodletting of a good challenge? Apart from its failings with the on screen crew and the easily predicated action shots, this new, young man may have more drawbacks than anticipated, I blame the mother, but I really do hope that he finds his feet and starts to make his mother proud, because I can see good things ahead for Jason. All he has to do is go and find some nice new friends and by putting the boot on the other foot start to take a step in the right direction. It's what a good boy should do for his mother",Friday the 13th
149,PeterRoeder,Pointless remake,5,16 February 2009,"Only good thing about this cinema experience was that I got to see the trailer for the ""Watchmen"" movie. I saw the original Friday the 13thmovies when I was a child, and thought they were funny. This new movie is more like number 11th than an actual remake though, also mixing elements from Saw, Texas Chainsaw, The Hills Have Eyes, and adding anew sadistic side to Jason. One good thing is that we do see a few interesting things about his background, for example, how he got the hockey mask. I had some high hopes for this movie, at least that it would live up to the word ""remake"" but really this was no different than, say, ""Jason vs. Freddy"" and ""Jason X"". It was just another movie in the Jason series. I cannot recommend this movie, and if the writers on IMDb had warned me against it, I wouldn't have gone to see it.",Friday the 13th
150,MovieGuy01,I liked this remake....,7,25 October 2009,"I thought that the remake Of Friday The 13th was a very good remake compared to what other people's comments say about the film. It is about a group of young adults that set up tent near to the abandoned summer camp, where a series of gruesome murders took place back in 1980. a grieving mother, who was driven insane by the drowning of her child, Jason, whom was neglected by the camp counsellors. the last survivor of the attacks beheaded the woman. But then Jason came back, and now he is a vengeful and unstoppable killer, with crossbows, swords,and axes The legend proves true, as these campers discover. Wade, Ritchie, Amanda, Mike and Whitney travel to Crystal Lake to camp, but Wade and Ritchie have found some weed and hope to raise some money selling the dope. However, the group is brutally attacked by Jason Voorhees. Six weeks later, Clay is looking for his sister Whitney in Crystal Lake, by showing a missing poster with her picture to the locals. In a gas station, he stumbles into Trent that has invited his friends Jenna, Lawrence, Chewie, Nolan, Chelsea and Bree to spend the weekend in the cottage of his family, and they discover that Jason is killing their friends. I thought that this was a good remake of the original film although the story was changed quite a lot. 7/10",Friday the 13th
151,Rendanlovell,Michael bay,3,26 July 2020,"The one where someone says,""I'm not going out there with a boner.""There's a scene in this where a character farts to describe their boss. Need I say more? It's possibly the most unlikable of the series. Not the worst, but definitely the most obnoxious. Racist humor isn't funny, dude bro himor isn't funny, and stoner bro humor is not funny. I don't know how Michael Bay got his grimy hands on this series but after this, it's no wonder it died.Every single character is loud and annoying. They yell stupid dialogue over top other, worse dialogue from the opening scene and throughout it's run time. Said opening is a twenty minute long excuse for kills. You know how you're supposed to use the first thirty pages of a screenplay to establish the characters, setting, and story? Well, this one decides to cram an entire movie in the opening act and then just start another one directly after that.Horny teens go to the woods and get killed. That's the first thirty minutes. Then there's another group of horny teens that go to the woods and get killed. The only thing that even remotely connects these two things is a guy looking for his sister that happened to be one of the teens that got murdered. Or did she?👀 Other then that it's two totally unrelated, identical stories. One is just hyper condensed.Aside from the structural nightmare that is this movie, the plot is paper thin. It consists of essentially the same two scenes over and over again for an hour. A guy goes door to door looking for people that saw his sister crosscutting with the horny teens being annoying or horny. There is so little going on in this it's maddening.But as I've said numerous times during this series, it's all about Jason. Who is treated with some respect surprisingly. You get both bag head Jason and Hockey mask Jason in this which was fun. The kills are another matter. They couldn't be more boring really. You got an arrow through a guys head, a few throat slits, and a machete head chop and that's about it.It's exactly what I expected from a modern Friday the 13th movie. Bland, dumb, and loud. What I didn't anticipate was Michael bay's influence all over it. He may only be a producer but this entire project reeks of him. The shakey, over saturated camera work, juvenile humor, obnoxious characters, and the all to familiar female exploitation. Michael you've done it again, and by that I mean you've ruined another franchise.",Friday the 13th
152,loomis78-815-989034,A Reboot that actually works because it doesn't try to be a remake,6,17 March 2015,"The very long prologue to this movie has some college friends in the area of the closed down Camp Crystal Lake looking for a huge stash of marijuana. After getting naked and wasted they discover an angry Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) who appears to slaughter all of them. Six weeks later Clay Miller (Padalecki), the brother of one of the missing girls is in the same area with missing flyer's looking for his sister Whitney (Righetti). He crosses paths with rich boy Trent (Van Winkle) who has brought his girlfriend Jenna (Panabaker) and other friends to his parents lake house to guess what? That's right party. Jenna immediately takes a liking to Clay and helps him in his search. They find Jason's old room at the closed camp and everyone knows the legend but they are shocked to find Whitney still alive in a labyrinth of mazes under the old camp. A fight for survival ensues with Jason finding his iconic hockey mask along the way. Instead of a remake, this is more of a reboot of the franchise. The basic elements remain; Jason stalking and killing sexed up idiots who have drunk too much. However this time a few nice new twists have been injected like the likable character Clay Miller looking for his missing sister, and the sister being alive because she looks like Jason's mother when she was younger. These plot points add a fresh look to a tired franchise and make this an entertaining throwback. The movie is loaded with hot babes (Julianna Guill as Bree is the hottest of the hot) and they strip down to nothing often. The body count is there and the blood flows as one would expect. Unfortunately the film is missing a trademark iconic kill that the earlier films seem to have even if the movie wasn't that good. Director Marcus Nispel does a good job with the classic series including some spooky moments of Jason being behind characters in the dark and having a lightning flash reveal him. This Reboot is like a mix of the first three Friday films with some new ideas thrown in that make it fun and for once, not offensive to the core fans.",Friday the 13th
153,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,One of my favorite horror slasher films of all time misunderstood and underrated,10,21 July 2019,"Friday the 13th (2009) reboot is my fourth favorite ""Friday the 13th"" slasher film of all time. I love this film to death. Jared Padalecki as Clay Miller is the best thing of the film. I love the gore, the fx, the music. Great music score by Steve Jablonsky. This movie is really scary and Derek Mears as Jason Voorhees is a real homicidal maniac. It is misunderstood and underrated horror slasher film.I love the story this kids goes on a hike in the woods and they dissapear and Clay is searching around Crystal Lake for his missing sister Withey. Another group of kids come on a long weekend and they start been killed one by one by Jason.I love the cast: Amanda Righetti as Whitney she is one hot sexy babe in this movie. Amanda is born the same year as me. She is my age and she is a hot babe. Jonathan Sadowski as Wade in the opening sequence with glasses I love him he is fantastic and excellent who find weed. Ben Feldman as Richie was great I love him. America Olivo as Amanda was beautiful babe. Nick Mennell as Mike Whitney boyfriend was great. I love hot babe Julianna Guill as Bree love her nudity man of man I love girls in this movie. Willa Ford as Chelsea love her nudity in this movie too what a hot babe with her brests. This movie has tons of nudity and stone kids but I love the slasher film. Ryan Hansen from Veronica Mars is in this movie and I like him.Marcus Nispel directed excelelnt this movie. I love the music soundtracks Sister Christian by Night Ranger. The song was also played by Jansen Ackles co star and good friend of Jared Padalecki from Supernatural. I love the song Freak Ya Loneliness by Bumblebeez love those songs. Sister Christian by Night Ranger and Freak Ya Loneliness by Bumblebeez love these two songs.I love the filming locations where the movie was filmed, it was filmed in Texas. I know this film is actually not people's favorite film in my opinion It is better than the original. I would say it is my fifth favorite Friday the 13th film in the franchise. Some people complains that this Jason is too smart killer, because he kidnaps a girl and sets booby traps so what? Just because they try something different and new is bad? No! the film is perfectly fine. Jared Padalecki is a bad-ass I love his character so much. Travis Van Winkle as Trent is a duchebag but I like him, I thought he was good.Friday the 13th (2009) is misunderstood slasher horror film, I enjoy the film and love it more than the original. Jason is my favorite horror icon. Everyone making of this film did a great, excellent job. I wish they would make another Jason movie. I love the opening seqeunce in which those five kids are attacked by Jason. The death kills are awesome and bloody brutal in this movie. Special effects are excellent. It is more bloody and I love the pacing in this movie.This is my favorite horror film I don't care what anyone says about this movie I love it: Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood, Friday the 13th (1980), Friday the 13th Part VI: Jason Lives, Friday the 13th Part III 3D, this one 2009 movie and Friday the 13th Part V: A New Beginning are my favorite best horror films in Friday the 13th franchise this movie belongs with them. It is my better half in the Friday the 13th franchise. The Hills Have Eyes (2006) I review that film and Friday the 13th remake movies are my favorite horror slasher films more bloody. This is my review of Friday the 13th remake film.",Friday the 13th
154,ApolloBoy109,I wanted more,6,13 February 2009,"Not enough. Here's my re-imaging.The movie opens with the established epic duel between Alice and Mrs. Voorhees. Off comes Voorhees' head. It rolls away. Alice exhausted exits. The head rolls to the dirty feet of a demented near naked young man. He takes the head back to his shack. He enshrines the head of his mother. He cries. He's confused, alone, cold and unable to understand the greater world. In true montage Jason survives. He hunts for food, protects Camp Crystal lake, discovers the underground labyrinth and lives a solitary life . . . until they come. Several Hells Angels have lost their way. Of the group, a very young sexy woman doesn't really want to be with the three guys and the other two b*tches, but she has little to say. (we'll call her Mae) They invade his turf, discover him and his stuff in his dirty shack and find his pot farm. They think they've got it good. They treat him badly, a little torture, a little booze, one of the b*tches sexually humiliates him. He's their monkey. They also mistreat Mae, and she has a soft spot for the demented young man. But when some rough sex and a little gang bang causes the death of Mae -- something in Jason snaps. Now he must defend himself against the ""enemy"", which basically means anyone who invades his space. And his murder spree begins. Five good deaths. A face peeled off by a sedentary motorcycle. Using his machete, the one he uses at his pot farm, he cuts a b*tch in two. Javlin's the leader and roasts him over an open fire. Buries one and torturers the man's head. A beheading. A drowning. Jason has become Jason.Now go on and show the first group of kids getting killed and the kidnap of Amanda. Go on bring in the rich kids and the lake cabin and continue with the story BUT FOR GOD SAKE will no one in this series bridge the missing story lines. What happened from the moment he allegedly (in the lake) died Will no one have the gonads to dig a little deeper into Jason.Yes, It was well put together movie. Slick, if unimaginative. Go see it.I'm just saying.I was in the audience June 13, 1980. A camp counselor at Camp MacLean Burlington Wisconsin. It was our last weekend before the kids arrived on Monday. We drove into Lake Geneva to see a movie. We came back changed, and scared. The movie had a profound effect. And I've watched everyone of them but I still would like one entry to spend more time on what I believe could be an effective character study. A little lost retarded boy who grown up to be an insane killer.BTW. By my calculation Jason is 60. He sure gets around for an old fart.",Friday the 13th
155,coconutkungfu-30704,Really Bad,1,20 February 2020,"This film embodies all of the things that people bring up as negatives towards the slasher genre: Its dumb as hell an as an added ""bonus"" it tries to make some money off of the name Friday The 13th. I quite enjoy the original Friday The 13th and I have seen every entry in the series. In my humblest of opinions this is the very worst one I've seen. I liked Jared Padelecki on Gilmore girls but he sucks in this one sadly.1 out of 10",Friday the 13th
156,tburke85,Friday The 13th A Decent But Flawed Remake,5,17 June 2009,"Friday The 13th is a decent but flawed remake from director Marcus Nispel who does a good job in making this movie but the lack of real scares, inventive deaths, more suspense, and character development is what weighed down the film the most. I preferred My Bloody Valentine over this one but Friday the 13th isn't that bad it just could've been better. The cast for the most part are solid in their roles including Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Amanda Righetti, Aaron Yoo, and Travis Va Winkle. The rest of the cast are okay but they aren't given much to do and like Yoo their characters are written out too soon for you to even care whether they survive or not. The same problem a lot of movies like this seem to have and none of them improve on either. Derek Mears makes Jason Vorhees an imposing villain even with no dialogue. He's intimidating, cunning, smart, and fast a deadly psychopath willing to kill just about anyone in his way except of course if they look like his mother. The bloody deaths committed by Mears as Jason are well executed but none of them are memorable, suspenseful, or original. The few glimpses we see of Jason's real face are disgusting and at least somewhat realistic. This film also had probably one of the longest openings to a movie before the words Friday the 13th even came up onto the screen which wasn't that bad but the beginning could've been shorter. Jared Padalecki from Supernatural does a good job as the hero considering he doesn't even show up till over twenty minutes into the movie making his storyline feel a bit rushed and it also seemed like he wasn't involved in the action all that much until near the end but he was the closest thing the film had to a lead. The movie does have some explicit sex scenes especially the second one and nudity mostly involving a topless girl. As I guy I'm not complaining but they kind of felt unnecessary I mean I'm sure there's some way people can make these type of movies suspenseful and scary without showing people having rough sex for a little while and girls showing off their cleavage for a few minutes. Luckily Nispel keeps the movie at a trim 97 minute running time. Overall Friday The 13th is a so-so remake with bloody deaths, a little suspense, and decent performances by the cast but after watching it you can't help but get this feeling you've seen it all before in other movies out there. If you're a big Friday the 13th fan you might like this one more than I did because it wasn't that scary or suspenseful as much as it should have been and ended up being a letdown.",Friday the 13th
157,TheRedDeath30,Jason Kills More Teenagers,6,25 October 2014,"I am a hardcore horror fan. I've seen more horror movies than most people have heard of, but I will qualify this review/ rant by stating that I am not the biggest fan of the original Friday. My tastes tend to lean more towards intelligent horror and artistic cinematography in most cases, so take this opinion for what it is.First, a generic statement. There is so much hatred towards remakes among the modern horror fan. While I understand the sentiment to some degree, it feels similar to that high school kid who always wants to tell you that he loved ""cool band x"" long before they were cool. A remake brings a movie to a new audience and doesn't really ""destroy"" your loved original in any way. Lugosi's Dracula, Price's HOUSE OF WAX, Carpenter's THING, Cronenberg's FLY...all were remakes and considered to be classics. Am I comparing this movie to those? HELL no, but just making a point.Has anyone really sat back and watched the original Friday with fresh perspective? Try to view it as if you've never seen it, instead of through the rose-colored glasses that are skewed by your childhood love of the movie. It's really not that awesome. I have a lot of respect for the original for creating a genre of movie. It was not the first slasher, but it was the first to say ""screw the plot, we're just gonna give you lots of gory deaths"" and do it successfully. That's what it's known for, right? It eschewed the suspenseful tension of HALLOWEEN, the artistic flourishes of TCM and the detailed plotting of most 70s horror before it. It brought generic teens (who acted poorly) into a generic setting, with a generic setup and made them fodder for creative kills and lots of 'em. That's what made the Friday series so successful, so why are we hating on this movie for bringing the same things? I am not saying that this is a classic in any way, but I guess I am saying that neither was the original. You just loved it because it's from your childhood. I love it, too, but I certainly wouldn't even put it in my Top 50 horror films now.I'm sure the NOT HELPFUL votes are coming because I said something that is going to anger the Friday fans, but so be it. It's just my opinion.",Friday the 13th
158,Jerique,First scary horror film in a long time.,8,16 February 2009,"This reboot starts off with some opening credits intertwined with Mrs. Voorhees attempting to finish her work on the camp counselors. They weren't paying attention and allowed her son, Jason, to drown. As she goes to kill the last survivor, she is beheaded. It jumps forward to present day and this opening lasts a good 20-25 minutes.Introducing the main protagonist of the movie, Whitney (Amanda Righetti, who most people will recognize from ""The Mentalist"" and ""The O.C.""), but she actually only appears on screen for about 20 minutes total time. Jason kills her friends but she somehow survives...and his held hostage by him. Then the time line flashes forward to 6 weeks later introducing the real stars of the movie. Trent (Travis Van Winkle) takes a group of his buddies up to his family's cabin, but along the way run into Clay (Jared Padalecki, ""who most people will recognize from ""Supernatural""), who's looking for his sister -- Whitney.The movie writers/producers claim to have used plot points from the first three original movies, but to me the movie seems completely original -- aside from the use of Jason, Mrs. Voorhees and the epic hockey mask.They use all the clichés of horror films such as: remote destination, drugs, alcohol, sex. The film does break a few rules of horror movies, but follows most of them. For instance, it follows the ""kill the black character"" but it doesn't follow the one ""kill the black character first."" I was actually annoyed the black character died.I think this is a great movie because it is the first horror film to make me jump half a dozen times since like 2000. For that fact, it deserves an 8. It would be a 9 -- perhaps 10 -- if it wasn't for the girlish scream by Travis at the end and Amanda's tacky last line. There's plenty of eye candy and sex scenes are greatly achieved. I really liked Jenna but was upset that she died even though she broke no rules in the horror film atmosphere.I think the greatest thing was the comedy offered by Aaron Yoo's character, who everyone will recognize as Ronnie from Disturbia. It's a graphic and brutally gory movie with laughs and scares that will keep your heart racing from start to finish. You'll walk out talking with your friends and most likely head straight back to the ticket booth to see it again.",Friday the 13th
159,johnsmithjanuary-20081,fun slasher flick,9,14 October 2021,I don't know what y'all are complaining about. Slasher horror movies are the one sub genre that you can get away with weak plot lines and mediocre acting and it could still be a fun movie movie. As was this one.,Friday the 13th
160,happyendingrocks,So what do we call the inevitable sequel? Part Two Part 2?,7,14 June 2009,"As a fan of the Friday The 13th series since childhood, I was sort of obligated to see this one. After all, I followed Jason to friggin' outer space and still enjoyed my journey, so I didn't think it was possible to create a F13 sequel that I would consider an embarrassment to a series that's had its fair share of dicey moments.As it stands, Friday The 13th 2009 is a film that is enjoyable despite itself. Once you get past the fact that there is no logical reason for this film to exist, and that the film-makers display little or no knowledge of their craft, the presence of Jason alone is enough to ensure that this movie won't be a total waste of time. After all, it's very easy to make a film to please F13 fans: get some attractive 20-somethings to pretend they're teenagers, come up with creative ways to murder them, and deliver the result with as much bloodthirsty zeal as the MPAA will allow. Since those criteria are all met here, the film must be viewed as a success.There are times when even the trifecta listed above isn't enough to carry this film, and several groan-inducing moments make the viewer wonder if the film-makers were TRYING to make a crappy movie that would forever turn off fans of the series. The opening moments of the film, which sum up the original Friday The 13th in three poorly-dialogued and pathetically-acted minutes, are particularly awful. Surely one of the best horror films of all time deserved a better eulogy that this? After this bastardized introduction, the film largely disregards the mythology of the Jason character, and considering this a recap of the first three films is wholly inaccurate, since the only references to those are the appearances of Jason as a boy, our killer wearing a cloth sack on his head, and his first donning of the iconic hockey mask. None of the characters from the originals are mentioned, and aside from the retelling of Jason's origin (which usually happened at some point in the first several installments anyway), this film is best considered just another entry in the series that takes place sometime before Part VI, when Jason first morphed into some sort of zombie man-mountain.The producers' ignorance of their core demographic, and indeed of the characters on the screen, is revealed in much of the stilted and foolish dialogue, and reaches its absurd apex in the first sequence of kills, when a future dead teenager wanders through the forest with his iPod blaring... ""Sister Christian"" by Night Ranger? Of course, since all the kids these days are into Night Ranger.Watching the alternate scenes presented on the DVD release, the producers' lack of taste is even more apparent, as two of the key scenes in the film (the donning of Jason's hockey mask, and his come-uppance at the climax) are nowhere near as well-realized as the original versions the film-makers decided to scrap and reshoot.So they did a lot wrong... That much is clear. This is all very forgivable, though. After all, this is a series that once insulted its audience by revealing the perceived Jason to be some random ambulance driver that we only saw on screen for 10 seconds (Part V, for those of you keeping score at home). Luckily, they also did a few things right.For one, Gilmore Girls alumnus Jared Padalecki makes a fine heroic foil for Jason, and his presence in the story is both rational and sympathetic (he's essentially Rick from Part IV, except he doesn't look 40). Additionally, the logical rules of which characters are supposed to make it to the final reel isn't followed here, which adds a few nice and unexpected punches to the rote kill cycle implied by the title.The kills are largely well-executed (no pun intended), and because of the leniency the MPAA has demonstrated with gore in recent years, they are much bloodier than anything we've seen in a Jason film since Part IV (thanks, torture porn!). Additionally, those who need nudity for a successful slasher experience will find plenty of gratuitous clothes-shedding here.The elements that film-makers chose to change from the original outings are hit-and-miss. While I enjoyed the idea of Jason fashioning himself a primitive underground dwelling, the notion of this bloodthirsty monolith taking time to plant booby traps in the woods plays as a bit silly and dismissive of the character. And, the less said about him mistaking a buxom 20-something coed for his mother, the better. Nevermind the absurd and predictable ""gotcha"" ending either.Overall, this is a serviceable outing for the series, adding nothing substantially new, but delivering the old with enough zest to justify its inclusion. Ironically, the very tactic film-makers were counting on to produce a hit here works against the film. By calling this simply Friday The 13th, the pressure was on them to reinvent the series and outdo the original. No, they don't even come close. But, if the success of this film means that we will continue to get Friday The 13th episodes for the next 30 years, I'm willing to play along.",Friday the 13th
161,TheHande,A stale package,6,16 February 2009,"Friday the 13th is an obvious attempt to bring some credibility back into the Jason franchise, in essence it's cramming three film's worth of Friday the 13th mythos into one movie in the hopes of giving the film enough back-story so that the audience doesn't notice that nothing has actually changed.The film is definitely enjoyable. It has its cheezy moments, its dark moments and genuinely good production values. Jason for once seems like a thinking killer, a truly scary killer, and not just a mindless shape that goes and dismembers everything in his path. The main three characters are also a sympathetic bunch, but the rest fail to stand out.Whereas the teen-group of the original movie was wholly sympathetic, more or less everyone else in the movie is depicted as complete morons. Also, I hate how the morality-rules of the Slasher genres are spelled out so blatantly for the audience. We all know that characters who smoke pot and have sex die in each film, why did the film-makers feel they needed to keep reminding us of this. It's okay for the movie to have some comedy, but in all it seemed like they were pushing for the almost intentional self-parody seen in so many other films in this specific franchise.And yet the movie has plenty of genuinely disturbing and gruesome moments which throws the film into a bit of an unbalance. What it does is water down the films attempt which I already described in the first paragraph of this review. Really, is this just another addition to the franchise than a real, experimental remake? Is it really just more of the same? Unfortunately, yes. It's a horror movie with its strong points but ultimately you would be better off just watching the originals and only this if you wanted to spare the time of having to see all of the same plot stretched out over 4 hours.",Friday the 13th

163,Mr_Censored,"Everything you've come to know and love about the ""Friday"" flicks, with a slightly modern twist.",6,13 February 2009,"If any of the ailing horror franchises truly needed a face-lift, it was definitely ""Friday The 13th."" While the series started off as ground-breaking and seminal, it quickly degraded into the cinematic equivalent of junk-food, thrusting Jason into gimmick after gimmick, pitting him again cyborgs and psychics and dragging him from the streets of New York City to the far reaches of space. Sure, for a genre fan, these were good times, and for better or for worse, it was a nice ride while it lasted. But eleven films into his resume, and it's gotten pretty difficult to take our hockey-masked anti-hero seriously. To be frank, it's been a longtime since a ""Friday The 13th"" movie has taken Jason seriously. All that has been rectified, however, with this remake/restart of the series, from Platinum Dunes, the production company that also brought us the solid ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Amityville Horror"" remakes. If you've been a fan of the franchise long enough to know the ins and the outs of a Jason flick, then you're bound to appreciate this newest dip into the Lake.Balanced with the right amount of terror and humor, ""Friday The 13th"" knows well enough what came before it and what it's audiences expect of it. It doesn't try to give our villain a new look, or a new, hip gimmick. No, it's business as usual, as Jason cleans house, mowing his way through a fresh young group of horny, drug-induced teenagers with his trusty machete in hand. It's not so much of a remake as it is another installment in the nearly thirty-year old franchise. In fact, the whole story of the original ""Friday The 13th"" is wrapped up within the opening credits, giving way to an all-out, all-Jason event. However, instead of being just ""another 'Friday' flick,"" this one has enough visual flare and enough genuine scare to keep the film feeling fresh. Long story short, it's the best Jason flick in as much as 20 years.Directionwise, this is one of the better looking of the franchise, thanks to director Marcus Nispel and director-of-photography Daniel Pearl. Although it bears some resemblance to 2003's ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" redux -- another film by Nispel and Pearl -- the correct mood and tone is set for this film. The atmosphere of the cold and empty wilderness is almost as foreboding as Jason himself. There were some technical mis-fires, such as some occasional blurriness and a missing sound-effect here and there -- although it remains to be seen if this is an issue I had in my theater, or a problem with the film itself -- but for the most part, this Jason flick is the most technically impressive, most gorgeous trip to Camp Blood we've seen yet. The script is a little light on it's feet, so much so that it's not worth digging into the plot. But that's okay, because if there's one thing we've learned, it's that Jason is at his best when he's simply getting down to business, with no frills attached. The movie is paced just right to keep the momentum going and there is never the feeling that 'something' is missing. All the right ingredients are in place to make the perfect Jason flick.Derek Mears (""Hills Have Eyes"" (2006)) takes on the role of Jason, and will no doubt please fan-boys everywhere, as he gives the same commitment and intensity to the role that made Kane Hodder such a fan favorite. Look out, because this Jason is lean, mean and doesn't mess around! Yes, he still loves whipping some young, nubile butt with machete in hand, and yes, he has good aim with that arrow, but there is one particularly cruel prank that sticks out in the film: The sleeping bag scene. What's that, you say? Another sleeping bag death scene? Yes, this nod to the original series not only one-ups it's predecessors, but simultaneously sets a new standard of cruelty for the J-man. Mears pulls all of this off with the brutally you've come to love and expect of Jason, and should there be a ""Friday The 13th Part 2"" in the near future, it's almost certain he will make a glorious return.No, it's not an amazing, ground-breaking film. You're not likely to leave the theater feeling like your mind has just been blown. What you will feel, though, is an unmistakable sense of satisfaction. For once in a long time, somebody got ""Friday The 13th"" right. It respects it's fans, while throwing enough at the younger crowd to keep it from being just a cult-remake that only appeals to a built-in audience. At the very least, it makes for an energizing and refreshing new beginning for the ""Friday The 13th"" series. Will more sequels follow? Only time will tell. But if such is the case, they've got a great head-start.",Friday the 13th
164,Thats_some_scary_stuff_Reviews,It's time to return to camp crystal lake.,6,31 March 2009,"I have never seen a Friday the 13th movie before. Then why did i watch this? Because of Jared Padalecki. I always fear seeing a horror movie. I don't like looking scared in front of my friends. But luckily Friday the 13th isn't scary at all. I got more scares watching The Unborn.Even though Friday the 13th lacked the scares it still had the jump scenes and the gore that scares some people. Friday the 13th had no problem bringing us the stuff that every teen slasher movie has. Blood, stupid people and sex scenes. So don't go to see this movie expecting anything other then your typical teen slasher. The acting was better then your average horror movie.I recommend it if you like slasher movies or you are a fan of the Friday the 13th series. I don't believe in remaking originals but who is gonna listen? It is far from the end of Michael Bays remake binge. Just sit back and enjoy the remake ride. It's just a bit of fun. I give Friday the 13th a solid.....6/10",Friday the 13th
165,GirishGowda,First time that I liked a Friday 13th movie..:),7,30 March 2010,"I have to say that I normally don't like & sometimes even hate Friday13th films. But, I watched this last night anyway because I was in the mood for some slasher films. I was aware that Jared Padalecki, from the hit TV show Supernatural was in this & it was also one of the reasons that I watched it.The plot is normal. A group of young adults discover a boarded up Camp Crystal Lake, where they soon encounter Jason Voorhees and his deadly intentions. Whitney Miller is held hostage by Jason & Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) comes to find out why his sister is missing from a long time.What I liked about the movie were the opening scene which was shot in white-and-black & the story of the brother (Jared) searching for his lost sister. The entire story takes place near Crystal lake, where Jason originally came back from the dead 20 years before. The usual scenes where the hot girls get naked & have sex with their boyfriends was there & also as usual, they were killed by our psycho Jason. What was unexpected was that Padalecki didn't come on screen until after the first 30 minutes. Anyway, he did a good job at playing his part. The locations where this movie was shot looked very good. I still don't like the fact that Jason kills randomly & everybody dies. Its still amazing to see that Jason get from one end to the other end of the camp in a matter of seconds while our main characters take minutes to complete the same lap. The killings were brutal & highly enjoyable if you're not freaked out by the decapitated bodies.:) Jared Padalecki is a very mature actor, if you watch his TV series Supernatural. But, he should not be type-casted as a horror movie hero. He is highly talented & the girls love him. Very bankable also. Danielle Panabaker who played Jenna was also good & very cute, I liked her a lot.Aside from all that, this was a very watchable Friday The 13th movie. Good to see they made it from the original. This wasn't a sequel, it was a reboot for the franchise.7/10",Friday the 13th
166,freaky_dave,About what I expected,7,14 February 2009,"THe Friday the 13th films have never been what you would call good movies. For me they have always been guilty pleasures, but not something I would recommend to fans not into gory movies where there are occasional scares but no real suspense built up. After seeing this latest entry, which is really a remake of the first four films into one, I can't really say its bad. Horror movie fans who love creative killings will love it, but if you're not a horror movie fan of the slasher genre, then I really can't tell you to see this movie. However if this is your type of thing, go see it.Now on with the plot, which I really won't go into detail about because we already know what it's about. It starts off with a pitiful prelude that goes back to 1980 and found me rolling my eyes, but afterward it gets better. Young adults go camping, young adults die in nasty ways. THe one wrinkle added to the story is that one of the character's (Jared Padelecki from Supernatural on the WB) is brought into the story because he is looking for his sister. THis sister was involved with the first group of victims, and now there is this second group who know of nothing that has happened to the other group because it has been about six weeks since the first group went missing. You all know what happens next, so I won't say anything more.Most of the cast was competent, better then many of the ones from the earlier films. THere were a few who were annoying, but that is part of the Friday The 13th scenario. I like the new Jason because he is much more active in the role, much like the Jason from the 2nd and 3rd entries back in the early to mid 80s.I will give the movie a solid 7 out of 10. It went out and did what it was supposed to, but if you are more into the suspenseful horror films, and not hack and slash with a few jump scares, then Friday the 13th 2009 is not for you.",Friday the 13th

Seriously, I hope nobody over the age of 18 is enjoying this because they're all supposed to be underage. It's pretty clear that the director is some creep who just wanted to see young women nude, and threw the script together last minute to make that happen. Please pass on this one.",Friday the 13th
168,springsunnywinter,13 reasons why Friday the 13th is good,10,13 February 2009,"Back to Camp Crystal lake again. The twelfth (couldn't they have made it 13th?) Friday the 13th movie of my favourite teen slasher series, so long-time fans will have a fair idea what to expect. Probably also the ideal date movie for February 14. Everything's getting remade and eventually horror will eat itself. This isn't actually a straight remake of the original but a do-over covering the first three films. This has high-impact Hollywood potential: Michael Bay is producing, the screenplay's written by the guys behind Freddy Vs Jason and Marcus Nispel, who helmed the not-awful Texas Chain Saw Massacre remake directs. The movie features Supernatural's Jared Padalecki, Amanda Righetti from The OC and Shark star Danielle Panabaker. The 13 reasons why this movie rocked are: 1. A lot better than the original. 2. Keeps you entertained right from start to end. 3. The next Jason Voorhees film after 6 years. 4. Keeps you riveted. 5. Worth you time. 6. Worth your money. 7.Enough blood & gore to keep the slasher fans pleased. 8. A lot of scenes to ""Wow"" you. 9. Good screenplay. 10. Cool cinematography. 11. Takes you back to the awesome 80s. 12. Dark and sinister. 13. The kids head back to Crystal lake for another game of hockey. Overall I don't mind remakes as long as they are good but this one a lot better than the original and do check this this one out on DVD if not the big screen.",Friday the 13th

170,RhapsodyReviews,Super Fun Remake.,7,10 October 2019,"Review:
'Friday the 13th' is an American slasher film directed by Marcus Nispel. The film is a reboot and the twelfth installment of the 'Friday the 13th' film series. This movie gets a lot of hate from both critics and audiences. I personally enjoy this movie for what it is and find it very entertaining.
This film follows Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) as he searches for his missing sister, Whitney (Amanda Righetti) who is captured by Jason Voorhees (Derek Mears) while camping in woodland at Crystal Lake.
I like Jared Padalecki in these types of films such as 'House of Wax' and 'Supernatural'. He plays a good down to earth protagonist, but with a side that when crossed could definitely kick some ass. I thought he and for the most part the whole cast did a fine job in this film. Derek Mears for me doesn't come anywhere near Kane Hodder as my favorite Jason, but to me if Hodder was unavailable, he was a decent replacement and was good in the movie.
There are a lot of people who hate this movie, and I don't understand why. They say that the people who made this movie didn't know the lore behind Jason Voorhees. However, look at It this way; this film isn't a remake but rather a reimagining. I came to appreciate that much within the first 10 minutes. The action begins almost immediately and builds steadily throughout the hour and thirty-five minutes runtime.
Overall, I say to those of you who bash this or claim it's a rip off or a poor remake. It's neither. It's a different look at Jason and one that can be appreciated greatly if given the opportunity.

172,FKDZ,Terrible characters and an abundance of nudity to make up for a bad movie.,4,30 October 2020,"I really went into this movie with some decently high hopes. Thinking we'd finally see a good slasher again. Sadly I have to admit I liked the first 20 minutes of the movie a whole lot more than the other 70.This leads me into my first point, the first kill(s) are a pretty standard staple of slasher to get the movie started. Only here they decide to spend over 20 minutes on this. Now honestly with how awful the actual characters are when the movie actually starts I guess it was a good thing. But normally that extra time should be used to invest in characters and make us care at least a little bit. I guess they thought they could make up for that with a ton of nudity and iirc this movie has the most of the whole franchise.Which leads to the main problem, most if not all of these characters are awful. Most of them are written to be hated, which makes us instantly want them out and as a results the deaths must be really good right? Wrong. Most deaths are quick and not very gory at all. With the greatest weakness of them not really being creative or interesting. When you make characters that are so dislikeable, why give them such standard deaths? The only likeable character would be Lawrence, but then again most of his interactions are just about race which is weak writing imo.Secondly the directing in hits movie has got to be some of the most sloppy and chaotic directing I've seen. Many times have I had to refocus and try to piece together the scene. It's worse because its obviously intentional. Also if you hate jumpscares this has plenty of them in terms of a character moving a chair or opening a door.There is also a real lack of main F13, like pretty nothing aside from the intro credits. Most of it just felt like generic horror movie music.Now about Jason, I don't like his design, first off him having hair felt weird. His face, though never really being shown in full was alright, but there wasn't too much too see sadly. He had like this white ragged shirt and green jacket on, imo his more tight shirt fit in previous movies looked the best because now you really lose that visual of him being a big and muscley dude. In some shots he crazy enough looks fat. His mask was fine, but his neck looked a bit off. Just all in all Jason's look didn't really work for me. Secondly Jason actually runs a lot in this movie and I think that was a mistake. I mean he still teleports a bit in this movie but seeing Jason sits wrong with me, like he's desperate to get that kill instead of *knowing* he gets that kill. That's what made him so menacing.The finale also let me down, how do you show off that grinding machine and now use it?! Like maybe not pulverize Jason but just a little, or his arm whatever. That whole scene I was waiting for it and they just fade to the next scene. Then for SOME REASON they decide to NOT call for more police but dump Jason in the lake?! Like why...there is no reason for those characters to do that. They're actually making themselves the suspects if the cops found those countless bodies. We get a suprise Jason though like the original film but its very predictable and he still wears his mask making it not scary/disturbing at all.4/10 first 20 minutes were interesting but after that it's not worth sticking around.",Friday the 13th
173,lovecraft231,"Finally, Platinum Dunes does a good remake!",7,19 June 2009,"So, how do you make Jason interesting again? Well, it seems like they finally realized how-go back to the basics. The remake of ""Friday The 13th"" really isn't a remake as much as it is a combination of the first four (and best) entries of the series, and feels more like another entry in the series than it does a remake. In short, after the terrible ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Amityville Horror"" and ""Hitcher"" remakes, Platinum Dunes finally does an entertaining remake.Granted, there are a few quibbles (since when does Jason kidnap people?) but for the most part, it delivers what you want. This is a movie made for fans of the series, from guys who know deviating from the formula (see Parts 5, 7, 8, ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X"" as examples) can hurt the chances of an entertaining ""Friday the 13th"" movie. It may not be the goriest, but it has some choice moments (including a scene at the dock which may go down as one of the best kills in the series) gratuitous nudity, drugs, drinking, sex, 20 something year old actors pretending to be college kids or teens, a guy singing ""Sister Christian"", a great Jason Vorhees and more.It won't win any awards, but the new ""Friday the 13th"" is an entertaining slasher flick that serves as one of the best entries in the series in a long time. Now if only they'd go with my idea of doing ""Next Friday The 13th"" in which Jason and Mike Epps (and if they coaxed him enough, Chris Tucker) must save the hood from Jason.Come on, that idea has gold written all over it.",Friday the 13th

Now, after his sister and her friends went missing, Clay Miller arrives to find out what happened, while a second group of teens are being stalked by a hooded killer....This isn't a remake of the original Friday The 13th. What this is, is an abridged remake of the first 3 Friday movies! It's as if the writers, Damian Shannon and Mark Swift simply took the so-called 'highlights' of the the original movies and put them into this movie. As a result, as written it makes no sense. At the start, we see Pamela Voorhees (the killer in the original movie) fighting with the last councilor. Then it cuts to the first group of teens being killed, THEN we get a second group. As I said, it's more a highlight reel than a movie.Marcus Nispel, who directed the remake of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre does an okay job, with the staging of the kill 'set-pieces.' And it certainly is a bloody movie.The cast, mainly made up of unknowns or TV actors are okay. But since mostly all they have to do is look pretty, then get killed off, it's not really a stretch.To be fair to the writers, they do come up with a couple of nice ideas, like the alarm system Jason has set-up around his home, to alert him of intruders. But then they spoil that, by having Jason keep a captured woman chained in a cellar. This makes no sense, as it's something Jason has never done before.The ending too fails, as it tries to come up with a 'shock' ending as the original had, but it completely fails.Like most slasher movies, it's not really scary. And like the remake of Halloween, I can't see who this movie is aimed at. Yes it is better made than the original. Yes. the gore and bloody effects are probably better here.

In this flick we have obnoxious, drunken, dope-smoking, 20-somethings that have their karma leveled by a hockey-masked super-killer named Jason. As in previous renditions, there are a couple of sympathetic characters added for audience appeal while Jason murders the other repulsive young twits one by one. There is much discussion in these pages about the lack of originality in this movie, but the fact is there is little originality in the entire Friday 13 series. The first Friday the 13th., 1980, was just an American re-hash of horror master Mario Bava's Bay of Blood, 1971. Fortunately, Mr. Bava had the good sense to quit after one entry; that good judgment is missing from the American side which merely sees the opportunity to squeeze a little more cash out of a dated idea.

177,utahman1971,Excellent Movie,10,13 February 2009,"What is funny is people call this a remake when it is not a remake at all. One thing is cellphones are not when the original was made or not in 1950's, when Jason's Mother was the killer. Another is the 2000's plus vehicles. Also, mother was the killer in the original, not Jason as in this one.Also, there is so many similarities of the whole series in this movie. This is a total reboot of the whole series, not a remake. You have to be totally dumb as can be to call this a remake. It is a start of a new series differently done than the other movies.So if this started with Jason and there is a sequel to this one, then it is a reboot, not a remake. It is not that hard to understand at all. So quit with the ""This is a remake"" crap. All the people that put this one down are stupid too. This is better than a lot of ones in the series.This is really not part of the series at all. Start of a new series, and also if you think wikipedia is not reliable information but the people that edit it are the ones that have accounts that are professional, and it does say this movie is a reboot. So quit the crap about it being a remake.How the hell is this a remake, when Jason is in his 30's. He is as old as probably as ""Jason Lives"" movie. Another thing is it started as showing the mother being beheaded and that happened first. So that was not her in this movie as the killer. So obvious that people calling this a remake is dumb.So 30 years after Jason's mother gets killed then this movie is done, means reboot, not remake. Get it through your thick skulls people. Same thing that Scream series. They were thinking of rebooting it and now Wes Craven dead, it probably will never happen.Series now a days are getting reboots, not remakes. Remakes are mostly not getting the sequels. Look at ""The Omen 2006"" and ""Psycho 1998"". Now those are remakes. This one is getting a sequel.

178,Der_Schnibbler,Updated for the 21st century degenerate teen crowd,6,23 February 2009,"Not a bad movie as far as pure horror elements go. The killings are inventive and brutal, the slasher formula is slightly tampered with to add a bit of extra mileage in the form of a ""double beginning"" (you'll see; I won't spoil it), and Jason is true to form.Of course, the movie is produced in 2009, so we have a few attempts from the ""chosen"" over at Hollywood to make it socially (ir)relevant. And so, every white guy in the film looks like he jumped out of a Levi's commercial (you know, fly-aways in his hair, slight stubble); another one looks like Tom Cruise; the white girls are blond, dirty-mouthed, and won't even bring their boyfriend a beer(didn't you know being useless is synonymous with being an ""independent"" modern woman?); the Asian guy is effeminate and funny in a predictably corny way; and, God forbid we forgot, this mostly white, well-to-do crowd inexplicably has the token black guy in their midst, whom the writers made sure to write so as to give us a ""lesson"": he won't help friends pump gas in the car because he's black and doing work would be demeaning, he snaps at one of the girls over some imagined racial slight that would only make sense to brainwashed P.C. imbeciles (it's ridiculous to anyone with a brain), and the only halfway useful thing he does is to be the single male to give Jason a (small) run for his money when it comes to physical, animalistic violence: black guy hit Jason back. Well.. at least that part is slightly more true to real life.It's hard to imagine any self-respecting white person would be friends with a black guy who was an oversensitive, ""entitlement""-minded little waste of life, who got his panties in a twist anytime he imagined someone is out to ""diss"" him.But, then again, that's what the hooks in Hollywood think our society should be like, and if they can't pummel it into our heads via years of forced busing and the decrepit public education system, at least they can attempt to do it in movies by glorifying drugs, encouraging women to be worthless whores, and pretending black guys are ""strong"" and deserving of a arse-kissing.Other than all of THAT hogwash... good movie! :)",Friday the 13th

180,tequila101,Friday Returns,7,12 December 2011,"The Friday the 13th remake which came out in 2009 is another modernization of a classic franchise which had a famous film, spawning at nine films in the later decades. Now Platnuim Dunes been responsible for most of the rehashes got their hands on this as well but I have to admit that they didn't do a bad job with this at all. I was happy for it but not blown away but what I saw. This ""so-called"" reboot of the first three or four films is nothing new nor is it original but it is certainly a good film to waste your time on if you're bored. It's also one of the better entries in the Friday the 13th films, combining blood, sex, drinking and a variety of kills. I am going to talk about the remake's pros, cons and I will also relate to the original films if I must (In most cases I will).""Friday the 13th"" (2009) sets on the night of June 13th, 1980 where Jason witnesses his mother being beheaded by a camp counselor. In revenge many decades later, Jason takes revenge on anyone who bothers to come to the lake to have fun. Two groups of teens come to the woods to have a good time but while Jason is lurking amongst the bushes, nobody is safe.Now the challenge for Marcus Nispel who directed the ""Chainsaw"" remake in 2003 was to see how he could modernize the story for a younger audience. He didn't actually do a bad job and instead did a decent job. I liked his approach, making it darker and more fleshed out in some parts. I believe he pays homage to the original by giving a small insight of the first film, giving Jason Voorhees his potato sack and hockey mask. All of the elements work here in a neat way.Like Leatherface in the remake, he does the same with Jason Voorhees. He doesn't give an origin to explain the character and that for one thing is a double plus because back stories means humanizing. I believe Jason wasn't humanized at all and that's what makes this film a joy to watch. At the same time though, there's something about him which we feel sorry for just like Michael in the ""Halloween"" remake which I can't put my finger on. It's because Jason Voorhees always thinks about his mother. Either way, it motivates him to kill more and more but we still feel some sympathy. Not as much as Michael but still a little bit. It was also amusing to see Jason killing two of his victims because they were trying to smoke the weed. Some have said that Jason doesn't want anyone to touch his weed. One other aspect which Marcus relies on is making Jason cunningly smart in this film with the setting of traps. To be honest I found this a good idea. I also like how he brang the monster back to his old roots with him running after his victims. The strongest aspect of the Jason character was Derek Meers who plays him. He really made the character imitating which set a moody tone for this film. He also gave darker insights on what Jason is capable of doing. He was very raw which worked absolutely well.The way Jason also got the hockey mask was pretty cool. How he just finds it in some rusty house hold. Not a bad job there.Other stuff I really liked throughout this film was Steve Jablonsky's soundtrack score. Very intense and tense but just not shocking. Once again this composer knows what he's doing but the original score for the first four films is much more creepy and suspenseful, giving us that creepy feel that something or someone is watching our every move. Here, it's just boom and boom. It doesn't make it bad, just not better. The kills in this film were a nice touch. Not original but still excellent to watch.There are some concepts of this film which I didn't like very much. For starters, the acting was near awful. Jared Padelecki, Amanda Righetti and Danielle Panabaker do really well with what they are given in their roles but most of other cast members lack in acting. Most of their dialogue is really campy and very silly and I didn't see the point in some scenes like the ""alcohol in the shoe"" drinking scene.Nispel also builds on the blood, gore, sex, drugs and alcohol so much that the one thing that made some of the original ""Fridays"" scary or shocking is Suspense. He really lacks that suspensefulness so much that you almost think it's just another action packed slasher. He really needed that core concept.I suggest you ""Friday"" fans give it a try. It's not as bad as many people have made it out to be. Even though decent, don't expect much as it is another film with most of the same aspects, similar kills and some clichés'. Marcus Nispel did a really good on ""Chainsaw"" and it was a shame that his re-imagining of another classic horror icon could'nt meet the level that his 2003 film was on. This film is also one of the best in the long running franchise. After part 7, the series was getting low on steam and I will admit that it was good that this happened because it turned out for the best and made some of the later Jason films such as ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X"" terribly awful. And those later films along with parts 5 and 8 were badly made films. This one at least gave us a new fresh start on things. The other thing I'll say is that it's better than the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" remake.This Reboot is decent, it could have been a lot worse. 7/10",Friday the 13th

182,TheRadiobox,"Finally, a good Friday",6,20 April 2021,"Friday the 13th was directed by Marcus Nispel, written by Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, and stars Jared Padalecki, Danielle Panabaker, Travis Van Winkle, Aaron Yoo, Amanda Righetti, Arlen Escarpeta, Willa Ford, Julianna Guill, Ryan Hansen, and Derek Mears. It follows a group of friends and an outsider as they try to survive the wrath of a masked killer.The Plot: This friday has a plan. A brisk, mostly smart plan to take the one good idea the original movies had and wrap it up in a slick but familiar package while eschewing the narrative fat that the originals have. Whitney (Righetti) and several friends are on a camping trip and on the hunt for a marijuana plantation. All things are going well until they start getting picked off by Jason (Mears). Once Whitney is the sole survivor, he captures her since she looks like his mother (good idea #1). Weeks later, Trent (Van Winkle) takes his girlfriend Jenna (Panabaker) and friends Chewie (Yoo), Bree (Guill), Nolan (Hansen), Chelsea (Ford), and Lawrence (Escarpeta) on a vacation to his father's lakeside house by camp Crystal Lake. Eventually accompanying the group is Clay (Padalecki), Whitney's brother who's looking for his lost sister. Jason takes notice of the twentysomethings and begins his killings again, but Clay is determined to fight back and find his sister. The presence of a purpose does a lot for the movie, adding an actual reason to watch and care to a degree about the plot; something literally none of the other movies even attempted, so this outing is already leagues above the rest.The Characters: Whereas the plot takes several steps forward into uncharted territory for the franchise, the characters take almost as many, if not more steps backward than the previous entries. Aside from Clay, who is a loner who has one goal in finding his beloved sister and will take no backtalk or resistance from anyone regarding the matter, and Jenna; who's a mostly likeable final girl dealing with a terrible boyfriend in Trent, the characters are walking cliches who point out that fact in the movie. Just because you point out a cliche doesn't negate the cliche. So stop it. Plenty of time is spent with these meat bags and their obnoxious dialogue and scummy behavior (cheating, egomania, overly sexual focus, and copious usage of drugs) only served to torture the audience until the main subplot involving Clay's search returns to the forefront. Jason however, is different from before with trapper behavior and speed that serve to make him an actionable threat that takes next to no prisoners. His backstory remains the same, but his inventiveness and brutality is insane.The Horror: Nispel's remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a solid showcase of his ability to create a macabre atmosphere by use of isolated locations with franchise history and new locations that add to Jason's character while still being claustrophobic and creative set pieces. Jason himself is genuinely terrifying in this remake/boot/quel/thing because of his aforementioned brutality and use of surroundings, a myriad of unconventional weapons, and his newfound ability to move faster than a sloth on ambien. One of the few selling points to the first 11 movies were the kills, and even then there were only a couple per movie that were shocking, creative, or gory enough to warrant sitting through the rest of the movie for. Not so in the reimagining. From the opening sequence to the credits, this entry doesn't hold back on the deaths, from tying someone up over a raging fire to fire pokers through the eye; the kills are nasty and cool at the same time. The limiting factor here is the characters, the writers' insistence on having scumbags front and center kills (get it?) the majority of the tension involving them.The Technics: Being produced by Michael Bay and his Platinum Dunes company has clearly benefitted the production, as this friday is far and away the best looking and best sounding movie in the long-running franchise. Nispel made the wise decision to bring back cinematographer Daniel C. Pearl to assist in another remake, and he does some truly fantastic work with lighting, smoke, and color grading; paired with Nispel's painting background, the look and feel of the 12th friday is unlike any before. Unfortunately there is still a bit of padding needed to make the feature length, and it's spent on quite a few too many sex scenes and a long final girl circuit. Your mileage may vary on that aspect. Additionally, some spatial logic goes out the door in the opening sequence and there's literally zero way around it. Money was mostly well spent here, but that's not to say Friday the 13th doesn't fall into many of the same traps that its predecessors did.Rebooting the Friday franchise was a good idea since the Jason character is undeniably iconic and deserved at least one good outing. This rendition does well by him and adds much needed stakes and unpredictability to a ragged franchise. Sinking the rating here are awful characters that make Jason feel more like a hero and less like the mountain man he is, which is certainly in line with the others, but familiarity doesn't guarantee a pass when it comes to protagonists.62/100.",Friday the 13th
183,filmfreak-5,This is a stretched middle finger for the true fans! 1/10!,1,13 February 2009,"This remake or RIP OFF as it is, is a big F-U to the true fans!!! Well I had the displeasure of watching it last night at a pre screening and i was very disappointed. this is not a Jason film. Jason is not in it. sure there is a guy who eventually finds a hockey mask and kills a few people, but it could be anyone - in my world i refuse to acknowledge this as a friday13 film. it is so flawed and has no respect for the original series. nothing is respected.sure and people say ""it's a re-imagining"". no it isn't this is a typical average horror film anno 2008 where they have just placed a killer with a hockey mask named Jason to sell tickets..i'm extremely dissatisfied with this.... Sean s. Cunningham was the producer and he must be lacking money cause how the h**k could he approve this piece of ..... i don't knowJason does NOT run, Jason does NOT take prisoners, Jason does NOT move as an ordinary human being, Jason does not not not... so many things, one would think the people behind this never saw the original films. but again, sure, why bother, they just have to get money out of our pockets, right?",Friday the 13th
184,tex-42,If Jason still haunts you...,2,13 February 2009,"Friday the 13th is probably in the lower mid-range of the Friday the 13th series. The main question I had when watching the movie is why would someone build a luxury lake house within walking distance of a mass murder site where people continue to mysteriously disappear.This movie is essentially a reboot of the Friday the 13th series. The events of the original movie are the same, but it appears that everything after that did not happen. The main difference in this movie is that the nudity is more gratuitous and the use of drugs is substituted for character development.The plot is very simple. A group of horny/drugged out teens meets Jason while looking for marijuana. Jason then does what he does best. Six weeks later, another group of horny/drugged out teens goes to stay at a luxury lake house on Crystal Lake. They meet Clay, who is looking for his sister who vanished with the first group of teens. It turns out Jason was holding Clay's sister hostage because she had his mother's locket and somewhat resembled her. Clay rescues his sister, but not before everyone else is killed. The ending is perhaps the biggest letdown as it requires both Clay and his sister to have not learned a single thing from the fact that Jason just slaughtered a dozen or so people.This is not a necessarily bad movie, but it does leave something to be desired.",Friday the 13th
185,Simon_Says_Movies,"Booze, Boobs and Bongs",6,27 February 2009,"""Jason was my son, and today is his birthday"" Twelve birthdays have passed for the masked killer Jason Voorhees since the series was born thirty years ago back in the golden age of slasher films. Of the slew of terms studios use to avoid the word 'remake' I suppose the best term to describe the latest 13th film would be rejuvenation. The series started its downward spiral after part IV and while director Marcus Nipsel's doesn't wipe the slate clean, he ads enough pizazz to make it the best of the series in nearly two decades.To give credit where it is due, this film does a number of things with the Jason character that are certainly a relief. Nipsel has opted to do away with the supernatural element and the super-zombie- Jason angle as well as giving Jason some spunk and cunning that he left with him at the bottom of Crystal Lake before part VI. Along with discarding these cumbersome characteristics, Jason is graced with a hunter/gatherer mentality that has him setting snares, traps and siphoning gasoline from locals. This is what the character should be; a loner forced to fend for himself in the forest; disturbed and deadly.From the get go I thought this movie was a disaster. Never before had I seen poorer character development or less tense of a build- up. But don't leave the theatre so soon, as the opening act is graced with a nifty twist that you will not see coming. The calibre of the acting has never been a prominent staple of the Friday films, but this latest offering certainly comes closest to what could be considered as such. The dialogue is acceptable, only occasionally displaying the wince factor, and the leads are likable enough that you care just enough that you don't wish for a machete to the skull.Years have passed since young Jason drowned at Camp Crystal lake, and the rein of Pamela Voorhees (Nana Visitor in a cameo) has been cut shortpun intended. Returning to the town of terror, much to the chagrin of the sheriff is Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) who longs to find his sister (Amanda Righetti) who disappeared along with her friends a month prior. Clay's journey intertwines with a group of friends venturing to a cabin for a weekend of booze, boobs and bongs including Jenna (Danielle Panabaker), the cabins snooty owner, Trent (Travis Van Winkle) the resident stoner, Chewie (Not to be confused with Chewbacca, Aaron Yoo) among others. Their story lines are forced closer together still as people go missing, and soon the terrifying force from the nearby abandoned camp is revealed. Aside from the Jason overhaul, who can run, jump and kill with the best of them, I enjoyed how the director managed to make the characters do stupid things, without making the characters themselves seem equally idiotic. The way the story unfolds, it is only the frantic ramblings of a few characters that claim a threat, which allows the others to wander to their bloody demises. There are still all the trademark Friday elements; a lot of booze, a lot of pot and a lot of nudity (which is overdone at times) When Jason first rears his ugly head, he has not yet donned his hockey mask, and I was interested to see if they could have him happen across it in an uncontrived manner; I was pleased if not blown away. Fans of the series should at least be content with the latest offering, but really there is nothing new enough to become ecstatic about. One death aside, it is predictable, and the gore and deaths are less inventive then the early films. There are moments of tension to be certain, and the climax, like all Friday films, does not fail to disappoint. Disposable, but nothing special, when Jason does return I am hoping for a full overhaul of the horror icon that will not be as unlucky as its title implies.6.5 / 10.0Read all my reviews at: http://www.simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com",Friday the 13th

187,joshuadrake-91275,A guilty pleasure in the Jason franchise for me! I enjoyed it.,8,11 September 2015,"I loved all of the previous Friday THE 13th films, but critics were wrong to criticize this 2009 reboot of the classic franchise that started in 1980. So, let's get started. Before I start reviewing this, a brief history lesson, okay? The 2009 film was originally conceived as an origin story, but the project evolved into a re-imagining of the first four Friday THE 13th films. The character Jason Voorhees was redesigned as a lean, quick killer with a backstory that allows the viewer to feel a little sympathy for him, but not enough that would lose his menace.But the producers Michael Bay, Andrew Form, who is married to Fast & Furious star Jordana Brewster and Brad Fuller signed on to produce with New Line Cinema and Paramount Pictures to distribute the film and this movie was released in February 2009.The film made $91.3 million dollars worldwide and it is the second-highest grossing film in the Friday THE 13th film series and received mainly negative reviews from critics and because I did watch the remake of Jason, my review will not be negative at all.The story follows Clay Miller as he searches for his missing sister, Whitney, who is captured by Jason Voorhees while camping in woodland at Camp Crystal Lake.This remake has absolutely nothing with it except some of the teen kissing, which is in some horror films today, but that doesn't stop you from getting one hell of a Jason reboot. The film is presented in a darker, violent and more brutal slasher than the original film, released in 1980. The original relied on suspense and tries to be scary, but this one has horror violence and gore throughout, which I like.The opening sequence is done in flashbacks, which I love and it is really awesome as hell, man. The rest you already know: a kiss scene, kids looking for drugs and Jason killing them all except for Whitney, before the title card appears a few minutes into the picture.The kills are just well thought out and I think this for the 2007 Rob Zombie remake of the original 1978 John Carpenter classic, Halloween and the 2010 remake of the original 1984 Wes Craven / Robert Englund classic, A Nightmare on Elm Street, directed by Samuel Bayer and starring Jackie Earle Haley as Freddy Krueger, Kyle Gallner, Rooney Mara, Katie Cassidy and Kellan Lutz. The kills are just amazing in this film.The music by Steve Jablonsky is really amazing and Harry Manfredini's original Jason theme should be in this film somewhere. Derek Mears does a good job as Jason Voorhees. Amanda Righetti, Travis van Winkle, Danielle Panabaker, Julianna Guill, Arlen Escarpeta and Jared Padalecki all do really great jobs as well as Aaron Yoo & Willa Ford, who also does great jobs as well in the screen time they all have.Overall, Friday THE 13th is not as bad as the critics say, but it is at least worth watching and it compares to the original really well. I hope to see a thirteenth Friday THE 13th movie in the future. 8/10.Don't read the negative reviews for this film, just watch this movie and enjoy it in the best way you possibly can, even if you are a fan of scary movies or movies in general.THE FILM MAY HAVE SOME SCARY SEQUENCES THAT MAY BE TOO BLOODY OR DISTURBING FOR SOME TEENAGERS!",Friday the 13th

189,Sci-FiHorrorFan,Underrated Remake,7,17 January 2013,"I must say i quite liked this film and don't understand the hate it has gotten.I found this film very entertaining and fast moving and i thought the acting was fine from everyone and i thought they played their rolls well. I will admit the first three minutes of the movie with the flashback of the mother getting killed in film 1 was not needed because we already knew what happened to her and it was kind of lame to see it again even if it was done differently while we saw Jason watching the whole thing. This film is about a guy who goes searching for his sister because she wen't missing and he meets a bunch of people at a store and asks them about his sister and no one knows anything and no one has seen her and one thing leads to another and the guy ends up going to camp crystal lake to search for her. This film may not be perfect but it doesn't deserve to get bashed the way it does either.peoples problems seem to be 1.Jason runs in this film.Well I hate to break it to people but Jason ran in the second film too,and in the third film because i remember seeing it,so i don't get why people complain about the running in this film,its also such a petty thing to complain about. 2.peoples other problem seems to be that Jason is too ""smart"" in the remake and he's setting traps in this movie to catch the teenagers and in the previous films he was stupid and Never did that,well i hate to remind people but he set traps in the previous films too,i remember very clearly Jason setting a Trap in part 2 when a guy got hung upside down by a rope that he stepped into and i also remember him setting a couple of traps in part 4 like nailing a dead body to a door so the teenagers couldn't get through which is kind of like a trap if you think about it. what so Jason doing that doesn't take brain power?.that seemed pretty smart to me because Jason knew by doing that the teenagers couldn't escape,i also remember Jason doing a few other smart things in some of the sequels too.people act like Jason is Einstein in this Remake just because he set a few traps?.I hate to break it to people but he set a bunch of easy traps that (anyone) could have set,they were hardly high tech traps like the traps Jigsaw used so i don't get why its so hard for people to believe. problem 3.some people also complain that Jason is too tall. Really? too tall? he didn't look that tall to me he looked the same as he always looked. problem 4.people complain about the secret underground tunnels in this film and wan't to know where they came from?. i personally thought the underground tunnels and all the secret passage ways were a good idea! who cares where they came from?. the underground passageways also explain allot,they explain how Jason gets from one location to another so quickly so its actually a good thing those tunnels are in this film! not only that but it shows the creators of the film wanted to be ""different"" now is that such a bad thing?. No i didn't think it was and neither should anyone else.Nothing in this film annoyed me except maybe the character of the A**hole boyfriend but that's about it,I didn't like him and he annoyed me at times but most of the characters in this film are likable and i cared about them.I liked the lead girl Danielle Panabaker who happens to be one of my favourite Actresses and i also liked the lead guy that was friends with her and i thought the black guy and the Asian guy where cool characters and i found them funny. The other characters that were with them i didn't care about but it least some of the characters were likable. I thought some of the deaths were well done and very gory. I will admit some of the deaths were a little lame but i thought most of them were okay and i liked the action in this film. This film was quite exciting and intense or at least that's how i found it, i thought the film had a lot of Action in it and i loved the grand finale when the lead guy fights with Jason and they knock each other out.I have to say both of them were Bad-ass in this film!, Jason messed a lot of people up! and the lead guy knew how to fight! and in my opinion he was a cool character and a good choice for the good guy. I won't give away how the film ends but i thought the film was pretty good! and people that haven't seen it should just ignore the negative reviews and watch it, Its a Fun movie for what it is and i enjoyed it.",Friday the 13th
190,chucknorrisfacts,People are too hard on this movie.,8,2 July 2010,"Ordinarily, I don't like remakes. Most of the time I find them completely unnecessary. However, if you go back and watch the original ""Friday the 13th"", I think you'll discover a movie that's very dated and in desperate need of modernization.A lot of people say there was no point in remaking ""Friday"" because the first one was ""groundbreaking"". Well, that's not entirely true. ""Halloween"" came out two years before ""Friday"" and ""Black Christmas"" came out four years before ""Halloween"". Those movies, in my opinion, are the true trailblazers that helped to spark an interest in the genre.I think people (both fans and critics) were too unfair in judging this movie. Let us not forget the last ""Friday"" movie before this was ""Jason X"", a movie that depicts killer Jason Voorhees dispatching teens in the future in outer space. Good God! If that doesn't show this series didn't need a reboot, I don't know what would! Basically, the franchise reached a point where it had gone as far as it could with its current continuity and the only way to keep it going was to go back to the beginning. That's what this movie did and I think it was very effective in doing so.Yes, everyone knows what to expect out of a movie of this sort so there really should be no surprises of what you're getting yourself into when you sit down to watch it, but it's still entertaining and I'd recommend it to both longtime fans of the franchise or to people who simply are looking for a pretty decent horror flick.Personally, I'd be interested in seeing a sequel to this. It's so much better than the Rob Zombie ""Halloween"" remakes it's not even funny. Those movies were utter garbage and make this look like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" by comparison.Overall, I'd say the acting was well done. As well done as acting could be for a movie of this type. Let's face it, nobody is expecting to witness an Academy Award caliber performance out of one of these things. It gets the job done and the actors certainly do an effective job of making you root for the ones you're supposed to root for and hate the ones you're supposed to hate.In conclusion, I'd say check it out. It's pretty good and a whole hell of a lot better than the original.",Friday the 13th
191,Minus_The_Beer,Your Machete is Stupendous!,7,30 September 2010,"The 2009 remake of Sean S. Cunningham's seminal slasher flick, ""Friday the 13th,"" isn't so much a re-telling as it is just another trip to Camp Crystal Lake with everybody's favorite unhappy camper. Produced by Platinum Dunes, the production company spear-headed by Michael Bay, and directed by Marcus Nispel (who also helmed 2003's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") the twelfth (!) trip to camp is more or less an atypical 80's-style slasher with a modern finish.What little remaking there is to be done is finished before the opening credits roll off the screen. We see a recreation of the final act of the original film, as mad Mama Voorhees (portrayed by Nana Visitor) loses her head, leaving her deformed son Jason to take up her mantle. From there, it's business as usual, as Jason (Derek Mears) dispatches of a group of horny campers before stalking an equally lame-brained group of college kids at a remote summer house near his home turf. On his tail is a Wade (Jared Padalecki), whose sister (Amanda Righetti) is being held captive in a first for Jason. Not only does this incarnation of Jason run a lot (you may recall he did that in earlier flicks, too) but now he's keeping prisoners? Intriguing.While the dreadful tone Nispel brought to the table with his ""Chainsaw"" redux is all but absent here, ""Friday the 13th '09"" -- as I would like to dub it - benefits greatly from a substantial amount of atmosphere, thanks to the excellent cinematography of Daniel C. Pearl. To say this is the best looking of all the ""Friday the 13th"" flicks would be an understatement; however, it is unfortunately not the most effective of the bunch. While the film starts strong with an energetic opening, it loses its steam as it attempts to reboot its own story about 25 minutes in. It doesn't help that our main characters are about as bland and unlikeable as they are good-looking, either. But what really kills the party is the lame-brain script by Damien Shannon and Mark Swift (""Freddy vs. Jason"") which is saturated with cringe-worthy dialog and cardboard characters. While such a thing was acceptable in the 80's, it doesn't quite mesh with the higher quality of film-making this re-boot presents itself as.It's not all bad for the film, though. Slasher fans who grew up with the franchise will relish the fact that the updated flick doesn't attempt to re-write history or shift tone drastically, ala Rob Zombie's ""Halloween."" It's simply a film about a guy in a hockey mask offing teens -- nothing more, nothing less. It also helps having Derek Mears bringing one of the most intense Jason's to life in a truly ""killer"" performance. While Kane Hodder may be the definitive Jason for many, Mears brings an intensity to the role that rivals his best predecessors and reminds us that is actually does matter who's behind the hockey mask. The kills, which are the true star of these films, aren't as creative as one would expect, but carry with them a mean streak that will have you actually feeling sorry for a few select characters. There's even a sleeping bag scene that gives ""Friday the 13th, Part VII: The New Blood"" a run for its money.For all of its dim moments, we must remember, afterall, that this is a ""Friday the 13th"" film and if you expected anything else, that's your bad. It's hardly perfect, and sure, many of the sequels before it were better (if you ask me even ""Jason X"" in particular beats it in the pure fun department), but it's also not quite as sloppy and offensive as some other remakes in recent memory. It may not make you afraid to go camping like the original did, but at the very least, you'll think twice about rocking ""Sister Christian"" on your iPod ever again.",Friday the 13th
192,piratecannon,Remake Fail,3,27 December 2012,"I enjoy a good horror flick just as much as the next guy, and when I saw the initial teasers for the newest Friday the 13th–in the recent trend of sequels/remakes it's titled, of course, Friday the 13th–I honestly thought it had some promise. Jason wasn't hacking up people on a futuristic star cruiser, and he wasn't battling another horror icon for bragging rights (although each of those films did possess a small degree of B-movie charm). I didn't fall head over heels for director Marcus Nispel's re-envisioning of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as many people did, but I did think it was just creepy enough to warrant a rental. So here we are with another Nispel/Bay collaboration. I approached the newest film featuring Mr. Voorhees with a combination of hopefulness and trepidation. After having just watched the recently released Blu-ray of Friday the 13th, however, all hope is lost and I've discovered that the sense of trepidation mentioned earlier was properly justified. This new addition to the franchise is a constant tug-of-war, with a feeble attempt to add some characterization to Jason on one end and a strong desire to stay true to the Hollywood slasher formula on the other. The outcome of this push/pull structure is exactly what you'd expect: a whole lot of nothing.The plot for Friday the 13th is as follows: a group of teens/college students converge on an area of wilderness near Camp Crystal Lake to seek out a rumored marijuana crop. They engage in the usual debauchery, and, of course, are brutally slaughtered. Six weeks later, Clay Miller visits the area to search for Whitney, his missing sister, who was among those who have disappeared. As he searches for his sibling, yet another group of equally idiotic college-age hooligans end up at a nearby lake house, and well, you can guess the rest.To put it bluntly, you aren't missing anything should you decide to skip this movie. Why? For starters, it's strikingly similar to the 2003 version of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The locals are, on the whole, comprised of an eerie mishmash of 60′s culture (complete with cat-eye glasses) and a strange ""hillbilly"" sentiment, which seems to manifest itself in the form of disdain for any outsiders visiting the area. The outsiders, of course, are the stereotypical horror movie gang of raucous Abercrombie and Fitch models who have absolutely no qualms about stripping, getting high, or playing beer pong at the most inopportune moments imaginable. If you've seen The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is Nispel's best horror effort to date, then, in essence, you've seen Friday the 13th.It's obvious that Nispel and company are trying to stay true to the horror origins that made Friday the 13th the pop phenomenon that it is. In the wake of truly original and terrifying movies such as High Tension and 28 Days Later, though, this amounts to nothing more than the same predictable garbage we've come to expect. In fact, it's a virtual guarantee that should you watch Friday the 13th, you'll be able to identify at least 80% of the scares far in advance of their actual occurrence. For a slasher flick, that's not good.We are allowed a peek into the everyday life of Jason Voorhees, however, which is something that's not really attempted with any depth in the other Friday the 13th flicks. So, what does Jason's ""To-Do List"" include? Well, his daily activities usually involve: sharpening his machete at a spinning concrete wheel; keeping his boyhood trophies in order for any guests who may drop in (including the one he received for archery, just in case you were curious about how he obtained his bow hunting skills); keeping the candles lit in a partially abandoned house, just next to where his mother's head resides in a literal hole in the wall; and, well, you get the picture. Absolutely nothing new is learned about Jason and what propels his madness in Friday the 13th. It's clear that the filmmakers believe they're throwing the viewers hoping for some characterization a bone by including these brief glimpses into Jason's life, but, for any Friday the 13th loyalists, this is–as the saying goes–tantamount to a slap in the face. It's almost as if the creators purposely went out of their way to make this movie as bland and predictable as possible.If you've seen a slasher flick in the past twenty years then this will be old hat. For the sake of horror, let's all hope that Jason will bring something a little fresh to Camp Crystal Lake on the next go- around",Friday the 13th
193,MovieProductions,Well... it wasn't bad but... it wasn't that great either,5,12 November 2010,"** out of (****)Going into a slasher remake of an original film that was severely panned by critics, let alone a twelfth installment in a franchise that took place in space and body repossession, one shouldn't go in expecting The Godfather IV. By the sounds of this, it sounds like I'm going to rip Friday the 13th to shreds right? Surprisingly, Friday the 13th, for what it is, could have been a lot worse. Then again, any movie that doesn't feature a psycho in a hockey mask that dissects his prey in a spaceship, is better than Jason X. Although, I wouldn't be too caught up in the fact that it's just a decent film because as a slasher, it also has its fair share of problems. First of all, for it being a slasher, the kills are very weak and devoid of excitement. The worst we get is a roasting sleeping bag kill, which is pretty disappointing. Even for the perverts, the T+A, isn't anything to sneeze at. While gore and gratuitous nudity don't make a film, which to me, doesn't matter, but as for slasher fans craving for this good stuff, sorry, but this film doesn't fully deliver.As for the homages, how are those? Well... pretty disappointing and anti-climactic to say the least. I mean when one of our characters finds a hockey mask, it just seems so random and out-of-context. On the other hand, when Jason is slicing and dicing his victims wearing the infamous burlap sack, it's pretty darn cool. Also, has the acting improved? While the original wouldn't win any Oscars for acting chops, compared to this movie, it seems like they'd be a contender for Oscars in no time. You have the perverted hot shot, the typical Asian dude, the ""nice"" virgin couple, and more stereotypes fill this movie. If I'm ripping this movie for everything, why such the generous rating? Well, ironically, I'm not ripping on this movie. A Friday the 13th film has intended bad performances, decent gore/nudity, and a high body count. If this movie had Oscar-worthy acting, some of the most goriest kills in history, and a phenomenal script, you can easily remove ""Friday the 13th"" from the title. While this movie lacks on the titillation, it provides some of the best chase sequences and suspense I've seen in a remake thus far in this century. Director Marcus Nispel certainly likes to create suspense and doesn't just have his actors sitting around in one spot. He makes them sweat up a storm, scream like a banshee, and receive a painful death. If titillation over substance is your thing (even though the titillation isn't exactly as strong as say in ""My Bloody Valentine 3D""), this movie should be a decent-time waster. While you'll be entertained with the break-neck pace, excessive body count, and its rich cinematography, be prepared for some of the worst acting and dialogue you'll hear all this year. Don't be fooled folks, while Friday the 13th is a decent slasher, it's just not fun. The movie takes itself way too seriously, in order to be a black comedy, the kills should be way more gory, and compared to some of the other Friday the 13ths, this is sort of lacking. Although, this movie is miles better than ""Friday the 13th Part V"", ""Friday the 13th Part VII"", ""Jason takes Manhattan"", ""Jason goes to hell"", and ""Jason X"" (even though it was a lot of fun, it was still bad). Just ten minutes into the movie, you'll know if this a movie for you. I found out quickly it wasn't for me because of how cliché it was, but then I realized, wait, isn't this movie supposed to be formulaic and predictable? I'm not recommending ""Friday the 13th"", but I'm sure most audiences will eat this up anyway.",Friday the 13th

The original was boring and there was hardly any Jason in it while the remake has more violence and Jason. I must say the beginning was the most boring-est part I have ever watched in my film life. The acting from some particular actors are full of crap while Jared Padalecki and Danielle Panabaker are quite exceptional.After his sister goes missing, Clay, decides to find his sister somewhere in Crystal Lake. He meets a group of wild people and strangely he makes friends with a woman named Jenna. Of course along the way he will encounter Jason and his plans but can he really save his sister?The gore in this movie is very rare and you never see Jason's face for more than two seconds which kinda sucks because in part 2 his face was a lot more shown. Friday the 13th part 2 is my favorite FT13 movie so far. I hope that the future ones will beat that record. Apart from the acting this will be an enjoyable experience for fans of the FT13 series.",Friday the 13th

It's well constructed, the acting isn't too bad, and it's never boring. The first 15 minutes are actually pretty sweet. We get a bunch a teenagers getting killed off fairly gruesomely and quickly in the middle of the night. That's all I want from these movies. The movie does diminish in quality as it goes on though. There are several instances where the camera jerks around in an annoying fashion and there are the dumb horror movie clichés that plague this franchise.

200,moviemaniac008,"Jump scenes... Sex...

If gory scenes make you sick, then do not watch this movie. Or rent it when it comes out on DVD, that way you'll throw up inside your house instead of on the floor at the theater and it will give you a neater impression amongst other people. You know, this was a terrific slasher film and I jumped many times. I think it's one of the first movies to scare me (besides The Strangers) in a couple of years.But why am I giving it a 9? Because the actors didn't seem to do their job right. Not all of them were bad, but the majority were. And what I really hated about this movie is that the characters you get attached to always die. Chewey, Lawrence, Jenna, Bree, they all died and i'm so sorry for them. No just kidding. But really, that doesn't seem right. You know, who cares really about Trent? He acted like a jerk to Clyde throughout the whole movie, and I started hating him in the first 45 minutes of the movie.

201,trnjamesbond,Texas chainsaw remake? Oh sorry Friday the 13th remake!,1,18 February 2010,"Well it's been a while since I seen this movie I rushed out to buy a ticket the day before. At the start of the movie it depicts the end of the very first Friday. So this was a little weak I thought because it is almost trying to rush us through the greatness of the first original film.Then we move on where of course we are presented a new cast of characters that we are supposed to eventually like and don't want to die. But I'm sorry to say about the only character I liked is the guy playing out in the garage and he gets killed by Jason I thought his lines were pretty good. But as for the rest of the clan I hated them. What a bunch of cliché acting like your classic druggie the sluts and the stuck up arrogant rich boy. Well I'm sorry when I was growing up I didn't drive around a Caddillac Escalade. And neither did any of my friends.I think that they are just trying to sell new cars and say that drugs are cool in this new instalment. When I was younger I seen the first Friday and it scared me but when they showed someone smoking a joint they didn't make a big deal about it they just did it. But in this instalment they make drugs as part of the comedy routine. I really hated this aspect of the film. As in the Texas chainsaw remake which I did like there was so many shots done the same way. The colour scheme in this film made me feel like it was the remake of chainsaw. And that one actor can't remember his name is even in the Friday remake. This movie was to colourful full of rich orange sunlight masking chainsaw. I almost felt like at times I was watching chainsaw.In turn I really didn't like this film due to bad characters, bad colour scheme should of been more true to the original that movie, every time I watch it makes me feel like I'm camping. This movie doesn't. This makes me want to jump in the film and kill off all the characters myself. Evenmy girlfriend was bored of this movie 10 minutes into it. Must say good classic Jason kill scenes but that's all. Jason looked okay but will always prefer the original(which I watched when I got home to shake the bugs off from watching this film.Also one last thing, if you remember in the first Friday, Jason wasn't even in it! It was his mother, this movie could of been so much better if they just stuck to the original Friday the 13th. They should of, as you would say mask the first film, it really could use a face lift, but the fact that the film corporations know that Jason is a horror movie icon/franchise, they just wanted to forget about the well written and directed first Friday and make more money by using Jason and his hockey mask as a selling point. But if you go back to the original, and feel the tension of not knowing really what's going on, and who the killer is, and what are the reasons of this person picking up an innocent young woman hitchhiking to get to the camp, and then eventually slitting her throat.I wish in this remake they would of focused more on the mysterious killer and why this person was killing these people trying to reopen Camp Crystal Lake. In the original, the acting wasn't that great, but this is what made the movie work, it makes you feel like a teenager again, and how stupid you would act out in the woods camping, (some of you out there know what I'm talking about). You know, the whole thing of rebellion from your parents, for instance, drinking, smoking pot, having sex, and just letting loose and having fun.This new version didn't capture any of this, it basically just said to me, if your a teenager today, first of all your nothing if your not rich and drive a nice car, have a fad haircut, and if your a female teenager you must look perfect act like a total slut whenever your out in public, and also must have ridiculously large fake boobs. Well if this is what Hollywood wants to sell our new generation of movie goers, it will eventually be just forgotten. I must say in the original film you seen a lot of normal looking everyday teenagers, and the females of the film looked normal and country girl pretty,(without the huge fake disgusting boob jobs) and the guys just looked like a normal teenage guy trying to get laid. In the scene of the new Friday when the girl is water skiing I'd would rather see a girl with natural jiggly boobs flopping around then a pair of tits that look like they have been blown up with an air pump. (from a guys perspective of course)This is all I have to say about this horrible remake, I love the original and will never spend another second on this new crappy, cliché, piece of junk, bubble gum version of what once was a great film. This film just sickens me to the point of vomiting all over the crew that starred in it.I'm sorry but I don't like films that are cheaply thrown together, trying to sell young teenage girls, that fake boobs are the way to go, and that you have to buy the most expensive gas gussling car possible, basically saying that if you don't have all of this your not part of society. All of these things seem to of over shadowed the actual film.Well shame on you to all who were a part of this film!",Friday the 13th
202,dudedazzreviews,Worst. Remake. Ever!,1,7 October 2010,"Friday the 13th is a victim of the remake treatment but is it different to the others or does it belong six feet under? Basically, it should be buried six feet under, set alight and poured over with concrete so nobody could EVER try to watch this movie again. From start to finish, it was boring and terrible. Everything about Friday the 13th reeks of horror movie clichés. Dumb, horny, weed-obsessed teenagers run helplessly in circles as a killer chases them and, even though there's an obvious way to get away from the killer, they don't use it and go the opposite way which makes you frustrated at them. The story is terrible and has been done before a hundred times but never has it been done so plainly and so stupidly. The acting was something you'd expect from a homemade horror movie, the characters were very poorly written and could have been done a lot better. The writing was dire, the direction was horrible and it was just not entertaining overall.I've never seen any of the other Jason movies before except for Jason X which I didn't like but I kept an open mind when watching this movie and I felt the same feelings that I had with Jason X, everything was just off and it was just pointless. There was absolutely no need for Hollywood to touch the Jason movies or his story, they should have left him alone and let him rest in piece. It's completely pointless and irrelevant, the writing was unbelievably weak and everything wasn't entertaining at all, it was just boring on so many levels. The characters were very poorly written and completely one-dimensional and bland. All they cared about was nothing but sex, alcohol and drugs and there was one or two characters that didn't but they didn't stand out enough for you to notice them. I thought that the Halloween remakes won the crown for Most Pointless Movie but I think Friday the 13th is a true competitor for it.Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com",Friday the 13th
203,legendaryunderdog,Not bad but far from great...,5,12 February 2009,"""Friday the 13th"" Marcus Nispel-style is a rather odd entry to the series. The beginning is a direct re-imagining of the ending to the original first film when Mrs. Voorhees got hers and then we learn that Jason happened to be present that evening as well.... well then we fast forward to twenty years later, we have some teenage/young adult kids (6?) hiking in the middle of nowhere, wanting to find some marijuana (with GPS devices no less!) so they can sell it and become rich, blah-blah-blah, and oddly enough at the same time, they learn that they just happen to be in the crystal lake area by chance! Insert a short synopsis on the Jason legend next to a campfire and well guess who shows up eventually and ruins the sex, drugs and the rock 'n roll, I'm sure your following me in this review just fine so far...this film is a little predictable in the scare department, its almost as your lead into the scare through the sounds accompanying it and not being caught off guard so much, although I'll be the first to admit to being 'jolted' in my seat from time to time during the scare scenes. Jason himself is quite an intimidating figure nowadays, he must have a personal trainer in the winter months or something, he also seems to own quite a stretch of property up in Crystal Lake (above and below ground) and its even equipped with fully working power! At one point there are flood lights that are turned on at the Voorhees residence by Jason! At least he pays his electric bills, right? The characters are lame, they really didn't give me a reason to pay any attention to their dialogue, let alone pay attention to the grisly ends they all met. The only 'incorporating' Nispel did in homage from Parts 2 and 3 were Jasons potato sack mask (which looked like Darkman's bandages to me...) and the inevitable acquisition of his noted Hockey Mask. The ending is your usual 'Friday the 13th' ending, I wasn't shocked and ecstatic by no means but I definitely was in no state of satisfaction either. I really think that after the opening title came across the screen after a fifteen minute 'introductory' sequence, I really became numb to the film. Granted, I give Nispel credit for trying to add something 'fresh' by giving a new vision to how this could have been the replacement to Steve Miner's 2nd and 3rd entries to the franchise years ago. But in the end it was just a lot of the same to me, just given a more modern/updated treatment. 5/10",Friday the 13th

Me and my friends have seen all the other ones on DVD many times, and this is a perfect adaptation of the classics. The horror, the music, the hunt, Jason himself, everything is on point! All the people in the cinema was screaming when he attacked, it was very joyful!! I really loved it! And I am a huge Friday The 13th and Jason fan. For me this was perfect, just what I were hoping for! I liked that they played with us all the way... Like the wheelchair in his hideout, now that was funny, for us that has seen the original!! And all the weapons he could kill them with, but chose not to use... Teasing! I loved it!I liked the fact that you don't have to see all the others before seeing this one.

205,zombiefan89,"Yup, it's a Jason movie.",1,27 May 2011,"Jared Padalacki is a nice hero character. It almost feels like an episode of Supernatural, watching him search for his sister. However, without Jensen Ackles's comedy to round out his character, Jared always comes off as over-dramatic and kind of robot-like. I think Jensen would have been better for this role, myself. Since he can not only do the teary-eyed drama but also be funny at times to lighten the mood.I hope I don't spoil anything, but it is a Jason movie. So, one should come to expect all the clichés that come with it. There's college co-eds having sex (quite graphically,too.), doing drugs, drinking...and getting killed by Jason! Let's say for example you hear the legendary cliché phrase, ""Give me your hand!"" Listen for it! It's a cue that something bad is about to happen! Occurs three times in this movie! It's also pretty obvious who dies in the movie, too. Those who remember Scream, I believe the quote was, ""If you have sex in a horror movie, you die!"" Friday the 13th was one of the movies that set those stereotypes, along with Halloween and Nightmare on Elm street.All and all, this movie was...okay.

Not a whole lot, it just easily could have been so much better.I WAS about to bash it with 3 IMDb points, when I thought... crap, it's not the movie, it's ME! I am 32 years old, and I belong more into the section of ""disagreeing parents"" than the target audience.Times and people have changed from the stone age called now ""the 80s"", so I CAN say I relate to the teens who go see this and dig it more than MY patents did to the original F13s (and the Elm street and The evil dead - movies) 25 years ago; however, I can also understand how they felt when I watched that crap back then - and when such travesty as ""Psycho 2"" was made, more for gorehounds than fans of the original.In retrospect, I think my dad got the same crap from my Grandma when he went to see ""violent B-grade popcorn poop"" like ""Goldfinger"" or ""Psycho 1"" in the sixties... oh well, times change. And let's not forget there's always been teen horror disapproved by their parents. I mean, how much novelty is there in the original ""Blob"", for example? In teen horror genre there are only a few examples that truly stand the test of time... and the original ""Friday the 13th"" is not one of them. Popular, yes, but okay at best.So, now we have the NEW Friday the 13th, that has a full legacy to root from. Is it good - Can't really say so. Is it well written or acted - HELL no! Can you spot the future star? - not really. The body count and level of gore are above par, and the direction is solid, but it all feels somewhat forced; as if Nispel, who headed the surprisingly good ""Texas Chainsaw"" remake, was forced back to square one to prove his talent after the godawful ""Pathfinder"".All that said, just a few things come to my mind: - Kids: check out the original Elm Street, the Evil Dead, Friday the 13ths part 1 - 4, and Child's play. Sure some of the effects look cheesy and... latex, but they DO make it up in other areas. At least in casting (we got Johnny Depp in NOES 1, ""Morpeus"" from ""Matrix"" in ""NOES 3"" and Kevin Bacon in ""F13th part 1""...) Plus: you can relate to your folks when you watch them. - Friday the 13th part 2 is something to look forward to: it's bound to be less uptight (=better written) and bigger (=bigger budget). Secured by the box office by this and guaranteed because it's the 13TH MOVIE OF THE SERIES! - They won't have to twist any arms trying to find away to resurrect Jason.

209,wynonasbigbrownbeaver,Typical run-of-the-mill slasher film. (Obvious spoilers even if you haven't seen it.),5,10 April 2009,"This is a regurgitation of the Friday the 13th, yet an okay one. I recently watched a very lame Jason X prior to this viewing and wasn't exactly expecting much on the new Jason movie. I was actually hesitant to watch this, knowing this was going to be a clichéd horror movie of glamorous college students drinking, getting high, and screwing each other while getting axed or maimed one by one. I have seen dozens of replicas like this before.As soon as I saw the fresh cast of victims, which look like they were fresh off an episode of the WB (Wait a minute, of course they are all from the WB!), I got kind of nerdy and I exactly predicted in which order these fools were going to get killed. The poorer the development in each character, the sooner they were going to die in the movie. This movie had all the elements to make a decent guy movie. With tons of bare breasted scenes and stupid comical moments on smoking weed and drinking. This almost didn't feel like a horror movie. It did its best on creating some jump scare but it overall lacked suspense that the 1980 version had. I think it is because Michael Bay is better at doing action movies since this movie has plenty of violence in it to give me a slight adrenaline rush. Yet, I walked out of the ending of this movie without being scared for an instant.Friday the 13th mirrors other slasher ""horror"" films of characters that are too stupid to live. Go ahead, let the token black guy walk into the shed to beat Jason down with a frying pan, better yet let him walk in there alone. And that guy with glasses, yeah just prop yourself against that tree so Jason can take a whack at you. As for that water skier too, just hang out right under the pier, thinking Jason won't look down to take a stab at your cranium. The smartest guy in the movie was that old guy who drove his butt off with that dead blond guy impaled on the back of his tow truck. He wasn't playing around with that. Lets face it, Jason is only scary when you are either stupid or just suicidal. Other than that, I welcomed bare breast features and stupid beer/weed humor. The ending was a giant turd that just didn't make any sense, other than the fact that my wallet would be in jeopardy for the 2011 sequel. The last two survivors were a typical brother and sister duo which is just like, say HOUSE OF WAX, (also starring Jared Paledecky), or however you spell his name. Do I recommend this movie? Almost. I like the original Friday the 13th because it was slow, suspenseful and it was a lot darker than this one. The fact that this one consistently had a high beamed artificial light gleaming in the forest alone made me want to re-watch the classic version. Don't watch this until you've seen the original!",Friday the 13th
210,andell,"A fairly good slasher flick in its own right, but no Jason flick!",6,13 February 2009,"Okay, I realize that in the era of the remake, taking liberties with the subject matter has become second nature. Outside of the rather faithful remake of Wes Craven's ""The Hills Have Eyes,"" remakes of countless others (Zombie's ""Halloween,"" ""When a Stranger Calls,"" ""Prom Night,"" ""My Bloody Valentine 3D,"" ""Black Xmas"" and of course Marcus Nispal's own remake of Tobe Hooper's classic ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") have produced story lines that are less pure scene for scene remakes, and more attempts to inject the original story with a fresh perspective.Well, this remake of Jason may work on some levels, but I think the sad point to this is that it fares better as a separate film in it's own right, and functions considerably less impressively for the Friday fans who thought there might be more to it. We'll get back to this, but before I go into that detail, allow me to summarize the movie.Within a minute of the film starting, we are brought to the beach side scene circa 1980, where Pamela Voorhees has cornered the last remaining survivor of her vengeance fueled rage. Astonishingly enough this single scene all but ensure that the original ""Friday the 13th"" has been hopelessly bypassed, and Mrs. Voorhees is already relegated to the status of footnote to the story.Coming to the ""present day, enter a group of five teens who make their way into Jason's wilderness, looking for sex and drugs (although not exactly in that order), and of course instead, finding themselves falling prey to the monster himself.Fast forward six weeks, and we find handsome Clay (Jared Padalecki) engaging in a fruitless search to find his sister, coming across local rich kid Trent (Travis van Winkle) and his friends, who are headed up to Trents family's posh cabin for a little rest and relaxation. Naturally the tension is stoked, and you instantly get the feeling they will be meeting up again.Of course they do, and they all meet up with Jason, who slices and dices his way through until just two survivors remain to stop his bloody campaign. On this note, I have to say that there are some very interesting death scenes that really do have to be seen to be believed! No doubts fans of horror will be enthralled, because the film doesn't let up for a moment, and by the end of it, I count 13 victims, which is fairly conventional in terms of Friday lore.But the film itself doesn't have the same feel of a Friday film. For instance, in one death scene, Jason rigs a victim up encased in a sleeping bag or tent, with an intricate knot job, suspended over a fire where they bleed to death.He uses bear traps to snare another victim, while he leaves that victim there to suffer. It is true that it wouldn't be the first time Jason used a trap (for instance, in Part 2, Jason did catch one of the victims in a trap...however whether the trap was Jason's or another member of the camp's is debatable), however killing for Jason was a primary impulse, and he generally didn't leave them to suffer. The book version of Friday the 13th Part 2 outlines this about Jason, relating the physical pain he feels to NOT killing victims when they are in his wilderness.Perhaps even more un-Jason-like is that Jason seems to have a relationship with his neighbors. When Clay visits one home, he is told his sister is dead, and that Jason just wants to be left alone, just like all of them. Well, Jason did pick off his neighbors in the Friday films: in Part 3, he invaded Chris' family's ""Higgins Haven,"" not to mention assailing a shop keeper and his wife who lived in the area. In Part 4, he couldn't pass by the Jarvis family without slaying Mrs. Jarvis and the group of neighbors.What was perhaps more unusual for me, a major fan of the original series, was the presence of an extensive tunnel system, alarm systems that were rather intricate, not to mention the fact that Jason 2009 takes prisoners and attempts to entertain them with the stuff he finds in the woods. No doubt the story wants us to entertain the notion that he couldn't kill Clay's sister BECAUSE she wore his mother's locket, but c'mon! That is NOT Jason! The original Jason was all about raw brutality; this one doesn't mind making his victims suffer, which in some respects seems to pay homage to the torture porn sub-genre of horror that has become so prevalent as of late. Having said that however, for all the brutality, this remake really isn't all that bloody, relative to films like ""Saw"" or ""Hostel."" In fact, it's not much bloodier than the other films of the ""Friday"" franchise.The film carries a fast pace, pretty scenery, and some funny moments along with enough T & A to keep even easily distracted movie goers entertained for the 90 minutes! And relative to what this remake COULD have been, it was a sound film.Though it feels more like the birth of an entirely different horror franchise, rather than a thoughtful re imagining of the ""Friday the 13th"" films. It's worth watching, although the thoughtful Friday fans will undoubtedly take exception to it on some levels!",Friday the 13th
211,Tina_jeppesen,Not true to original Jason character,3,18 June 2019,"Ya...well we had gotten some movies at the pawn shop and this was pretty awesome after viewing meet the Spartans which was like the worst movie ever lol. Other than that...I'm a 70s/80s kid and lovvve horror from that era so this pissed me off of course. Whoever did all this didn't respect the original Jason character at all. Any real horror fan knows what I mean. I don't expect good acting or awesome plot with the Friday the 13ths...obviously, but it's definitely missing that feeling of the first ones, I mean the first 3-5 before they got pretty much unwatchable. This was made during that annoying era too, when a ""cast"" was a buncha pretty white people who all look alike and literally one token black guy and one Asian guy. U know they didn't make it to the end surprise surprise. In fact unless u are kinda retarded u know from the super obvious ""clue"" who will make it to the end within the first 20 minutes but o well at least they stuck to the final girl...no wait they didn't, and the ending they tried to stick to the original concept but just failed because there was no mystery just a ""wtf???""",Friday the 13th
212,misbegotten,"Not really a remake, and not really any good either. Only worth watching for Julianna Guill",4,17 February 2009,"Judging by the majority of comments on-line, most fans of the Friday the 13th movies seem to regard the first four films in the series as being superior to those that followed. Personally, I've always thought that the initial five entries (Friday the 13th - Friday the 13th Part 5: A New Beginning) to be quite uninspiring, slapdash and interchangeable. It's only from Friday the 13th Part 6: Jason Lives! onwards that the series becomes entertaining and worthwhile. In my opinion, Friday the 13th is the only movie franchise that actually gets better as it progresses (Jason X is by far my favourite entry).I already knew prior to seeing this film - from articles read on-line during the movie's development and production - that the new Friday the 13th was no more a true remake than last year's Prom Night was (apart from it's title, Prom Night 2008 took nothing from the original film). Friday the 13th 2009 pays lip service to events in the first three movies of the series, but then just settles down to being what it truly is: a new Jason film. It's only been described and marketed as a remake because such cinematic reduxs are currently in vogue.Unfortunately, Friday the 13th 2009 is a sub-standard slasher that simply can't complete with the more recent Jason movies and even rival efforts (such as the My Bloody Valentine remake). Long sections of the film are actually quite dull, and the two-dimensional characters are disappointing. Now I know that it's traditional for potential Jason fodder to easily fit into pigeon holes labelled The Arrogant/Macho Jerk, The Sensible Girl, The Token Black Guy, The Oversexed Couple, The Dependable Guy, The Stoner, The Slutty Girl, etc. But at least in the earlier movies these stereotypes were handled with flare - in Friday the 13th 2009 the characterisations are so flat that there's nothing the capable cast can do to inject any life into their roles. The only exception is Julianna Guill, who plays Bree. She's so engaging and lively that she emerges as the only likable person in the film (despite the fact that she's portraying The Slutty Girl who dances provocatively in front of all the men present, then has sex with her best friend's boyfriend) and was the only character I hoped wouldn't end up on the business end of Jason's machete. Incidentally, Guill looks so much like Amanda Bynes that until I read the end credits I'd spent the entire movie thinking it was Bynes, and that she'd taken on the role (complete with lengthy naked sex scene) to leave behind her tween image.Apart from spartan characterisation, another slasher film tradition is people doing stupid things and getting themselves killed as a result. But Scream and it's sequels torn apart all those slasher clichés over ten years ago, so there really is no excuse for the scene in which one character realises that Jason might have climbed in through the bathroom window, and instead of running downstairs as fast as they can, proceeds to nervously open cupboard doors and peek behind the shower curtain.Jason himself is portrayed as more intelligent than ever before: he carefully disposes of the bodies of his victims and their belongings, sets traps for others, and even has a rudimentary early-warning system to alert him when anybody comes near his hideout. But what's missing is a substantial amount of menace and sense of forbidding. Instead of the walking engine of destruction seen in some of the previous movies, Jason here is just some large guy lumbering about in the woods.",Friday the 13th
213,McFrogg,Friday the Turdteenth,1,5 May 2017,"To be honest, the Friday the 13th movies have always been garbage, bottom-of-the-barrel horror movies. An excuse to show gruesome and ""inventive"" killings by the ""badass"" Jason Vorhees, and of course, naked women. To make a comparison: if the original Nosferatu is Vivaldi, Friday the 13th is a sad old hobo banging on a dirty saucepan while he's playing his homemade harmonica.But the pornographic remake is even worse than the previous attempts at making horror movies. I have rarely seen a horror movie with more vulgar stuff in it than this one, it's even worse than the horrible ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"". And it's not just the sexual content, the violence is much more sadistic than before. As with the sex, the violence is just there for the viewer's pleasure. It's completely unnecessary...People can't make good horror movies (or comedies) anymore. They're more interested in graphic sexual acts, jump scares and gore than good storytelling. Movies like Friday the 13th aren't really horror movies at all, it should be in a different genre. Maybe ""loser movies"" or ""pervert movies"" would be better?(Zero stars)",Friday the 13th
214,moonmonday,Serviceable Sequel of Sorts,6,25 October 2009,"When I heard of a remake of the classic Friday the 13th, I was less than enthused. Seeing a mediocre director attached wasn't very inspiring, and the two screenwriters were atrocious in their previous festival of plagiarism.When I finally got around to seeing it, though, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised, though this might have been because my expectations were so low. What this movie presents is a convincing sequel that is about comparable to some of the series. It has a unique approach, in that the first 20 minutes or so and the last 80 are mostly separate, and it even tacks on some necessary plot recap before the story really starts at the beginning.The pacing was pretty good, the story was pretty standard -- it's hard to mess it up substantially -- and the characters are a typical selection, with a couple of exceptions. One such exception is the character of Clay, played by Jared Padalecki, who is looking for his missing sister, who was in the story of the first 20 minutes. He serves as a link between the two groups and keeps the plot moving. He's also admirably easy on the eyes, so that's an added bonus.Generally the acting is certainly solid enough for the series, and the characters are treated as well as they can be, considering their stereotypical natures. It was almost refreshing to see the familiar take on them. Apparently the writers have learned a lot since Freddy vs. Jason, and they've given a more welcome sort of familiarity, rather than uncomfortably awkward attempts at homage that border on outright theft. Also thankfully absent are unwelcome homophobic epithets, which were blatantly offensive and jarringly abused in that film, although there is more profanity than strictly necessary; certain lines came as somewhat forced due to overuse of expletives.The direction was okay, though not fantastic. The cinematography was rather shockingly bad in some cases, and fine in others. I do wish that more directors would go away from the attempts to inject tension by way of a shaky camera, because it only irritates. There is never and was never anything wrong with a steady camera shot! Colours are, surprisingly, vibrant and used pretty well overall, to set mood; there isn't so much of the overwhelming greys, browns, and such used as another staple of horror these days.The story is all right for what it is, although it kind of starts to lose its appeal steadily after about the first hour. It picks up again little by little towards the end, and it leaves one feeling generally satisfied, although also thinking that perhaps, they may have tried too hard to condense too many elements from the rest of the series into a single film. There is also the problematic element of the evidently vast tunnel system, which is really implausible considering it's literally right under a lake. And even that is no explanation to how Jason can move so fast; although in part 7 he seemed to be able to teleport, it was generally in keeping with the script that he was able to appear dramatically. This film, however, was closer to part 8 in the absolutely unbelievable ability for Jason to move very obviously over too great a distance in far too short a time. It detracted significantly from the impact of what should have logically been the tensest part of the film, which is a shame.The complaints from several other viewers that this film seemed to take too much from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake are not without validity. Whereas in the series previously it was shown that Crystal Lake was a small town with its share of controversy and legend, this take on it seems only to depict awkward rural stereotypes. The much-ballyhooed mask discovering scene, too, was completely arbitrary and much more meaningless than the original.There was a lot of sex and nudity in this, more than the previous series, although I can admit that much of that was due to MPAA censorship in the 80s. There's a similar level of nudity between the male and female characters -- mainly above the waist, aside from a buttock or two here and there -- but I did find it a bit excessive since it was not as playful and fun as the nudity in the earlier films tended to be. That's just personal preference though. I did like that they played up Clay's attractiveness and let him be appealing, probably due to recognition for his work in television.It was nice to see a strong male protagonist who made it through, which is uncommon for these films thanks to the inaccurate stereotype of 'virginal last girl standing'. The kills in this were unexceptional and, at times, too time-consuming and unpleasantly dull, or just unpleasant, and not in an entertaining way.Overall, this is all right for what it is, but it's really more like an okay sequel than it is a remake or something new. It's not in a spirit of fun like part 8 was, yet it has many of the same flaws. It tries to be as compelling as part 4, but it doesn't have its strengths either. There are many 'almost, but not quite' elements about this film, but it does all right in what it does accomplish.It's a pretty good Friday the 13th film, and true enough to the series to be enjoyable. It has too many unanswered questions, poor continuity, ridiculous apparent teleportation, dodgy direction, bad camera work, and uneven scripting to be the holy grail that some wished for, but it was good enough to be unobjectionable, and that is an accomplishment indeed for the crew.Maybe the sequel will be even better. We can hope so.",Friday the 13th
215,Red_Flag,Friday the 13th...a day that never ends!,1,17 February 2009,"At this point, number 12 in this ever disappointing franchise, it's unlikely I'll find anyone willing to give Jason another shot at reinventing himself in this. It's unfortunate then that this entry fails to do any justice to the original movies in this overblown franchise. Right off the bat were plunged into a unfortunate situation among some of the most unlikable characters known to man. The original protagonists fails to be any more relatable, understandable or hell even likable than Jason himself. Its sick, but at times I felt relief when these characters met their demise if only because being in their company is irritating to say the least. The fact that the director expects us to sympathise with them is outrageous and its near impossible to feel any emotions toward any of them.This, however, remains the least of my worries. I never expected this to be a good movie. the trailer looks decent at best but nothing really stood out, in saying this I didn't walk in wanting to hate the movie. Anyone who knows me will know that Friday The 13th is one of my favourite horror movies of all time so to see this done well would have been a dream come true for me. The problem arises when I come to realise that none of the so called ""scares"" that are been thrown in our faces are in any way, shape or form scary. There mediocre at best and if you're not going to be a well made slasher flick at least have the will power to scare me.The original handful of Friday films had a certain low-rent elegance about them, and this slickly done, dimly lighted, whiplash-edited update loses that too. The story has been pulled from its shallow grave, but not at all reinvigorated. Rather, it's been dusted off and repackaged for the sole purpose of raking in millions from foolish audiences.A man in search of his missing sister stumbles across a deadly secret in the woods surrounding Crystal Lake as Texas Chainsaw Massacre redux duo Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel resurrect one of the silver screen's most feared slashers -- machete-wielding, hockey mask-wearing madman Jason Voorhees. The last time Clay heard from his sister, she was headed toward Crystal Lake. There, amidst the creaky old cabins and moss-coated trees, an unstoppable force of evil lies quietly dormant, patiently waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Though the police and locals all warn Clay to stay as far away from Crystal Lake as possible, it's the only lead he has, and he isn't willing to give up until he finds his sister. Clay isn't the only one inhabiting these woods either, because a group of thrill-seeking college students have just arrived at Crystal Lake hoping for a wild weekend of fun in the sun. Later, as Clay and one of the recently arrived revelers search for clues, the infamous Jason Voorhees emerges to show them just why the locals have avoided these woods for years. Could it be that Clay's sister has already met a grim demise at the end of Jason's razor-sharp machete, or is she still out there somewhere in the woods, waiting for her brother to come to her rescue? Freddy vs. Jason scribes Damian Shannon and Mark Swift pen the screenplay for a remake executive produced by Sean S. Cunningham (producer/director of the original Friday the 13th).Verdict: Everything feels textbook, novice and amateurish when it comes down to it, you predict every death, you feel no sympathy for any of these characters and while the blood may be admirable and the opening sequence (a homage to the original) may be pretty intense this boils down to nothing more that sheer boredom. everything in post production seems so rushed and straight to DVD you wonder why they even bothered. If nothing else, just scare me. This, however, failed to even do that. For my overall rating I give Friday the 13th 1/5.",Friday the 13th
216,crickwill,Close but no cigar..,4,29 March 2020,"Watching this tepid remake again after an 11 year interval proved that it hasn't improved. It must appear so easy for a bunch of newbies to trundle along and re-fashion a remake out of an iconic original and make a lot of money out of it (whether or not they did is another story), however the film is so flat and lacking in atmosphere or anything else, it's to be expected. In the special features of the DVD release, the new young cast members proclaim it's a new Friday The 13th for our generation but apart from the fact that they carry mobile phones and other equipment, it's all just a shoddy, dispiriting affair, dumbed down to accommodate the least discriminating audiences. It's not good enough. Shrouded in the best PBS available (Pitch Black Syndrome), you'd barely recognize Crystal Lake as the actual setting. Remember some of the beautiful woodsy outdoor shots that made the 1980 original stand out? Nothing of the sort here, there's a handful of scenes in daylight early in this remake and then of course we are plunged into eternal nighttime, where there are admittedly a couple of decent kills if you strain hard enough to see them. Jason is remarkably without presence and the whole thing leaves a stale, unsatisfying aftertaste once it's thankfully all over.

217,windypoplar,Jason meets beauty and the beast?,2,21 July 2009,"OK, I was psyched for this ""update"" of the classic slasher film of the '80s. Unfortunately this was a colossal disappointment. The beginning is fairly standard stuff, dumb, good-looking people who can't act are stupid enough to be near Camp Crystal Lake (in a state never mentioned) and tell stories about poor Jason Voorhees, the deformed retard who kills. Well guess what? They get hacked! Gee, that was surprising!I assumed once the ""Stars' of our film came on the acting would get better, I was wrong. Okay, so u shouldn't got to a horror film for great acting right? But still, did they all have to suck so badly? The original wasn't duly great either, but it did have a great setup, poor Jason is left to drown by oversexed camp counselors, Jason's Mom blames them and begins killing, later Jason, down at the bottom of Crystal Lake, is possessed by a demon and emerges an unstoppable killer. Great stuff, but even in the first they really didn't know how to make it work. So they cheated, Jason isn't seen till the last frame! Marcus Nispel, and really this guys thinks lighting is all there is to directing, sadly no, Marcus, we also would like plot and character development and some decent shots!! I'm not kidding, but more on that later. Doesn't do anything new here except bastardize everything that was so good in the original series. I won't divulge plot if you want to see this, but really it's quite awful, there is a strong clue in my summary.I give this two stars only because of two thing. One there is a nice plot twist halfway through, though it is interesting to see that the girl, again I'm trying not to give it away, it clearly in sunlight while the actors in the exterior shot are running around in darkness! Nice touch Nispel, thinking of those old music videos again? The other scene is a graphic, but very hot, sex scene between Travis Winkle and the girl who plays Bree, nice. Still this doesn't make up for a crummy re=imagining. Yes, Jason dons the hockey mask but the scene has nothing to it! No setup, no foreboding, no style, there were two different take,s but neither is any good. The actor playing Jason seems to be channeling Ted Nugent!

It follows the story of a masked murderer killing off a group of clichéd, stoner teenagers.The deaths are unimaginative, predictable and laughable. It is obvious that this film was manufactured for an obtuse audience, there is a dose of explicit sex, drug taking and ragged jokes; the screenplay was horrific with such lines as ""you have such great nipple placement""!This film embodies a deteriorated genre. Modern horror is mostly a barrage of gore mixed with pseudo-tension programmed to cause jumps to the audience. Unfortunately, psychological horror (in films such as 'The Shining', 'The exorcist' and other old horror films) has become a thing of the past. For me, Michael Bay must be stopped. He's producing further remakes of Nightmare on Elm Street and Alfred Hitchcock's 'The Birds'.Despite the obvious low quality of this film, it's topped the US box office and so Bay is getting what he wanted, money for garbage.

220,fritzlang,Makes original look like Citizen Kane,1,26 December 2009,"Look, I know F13 series was never high art. it was never really clever (except maybe part 6).. it was camp. but in general, it was fun.This film alternated between three moods 1) nothing. I mean there is at least ONE HOUR where NOTHING HAPPENS! a bunch of moronic, profanity-laden kids TALK!!! No suspense. No horror. No humor.. NOTHING!! 2) Sex. Hey, part of the slasher genre is some sex scenes. But this felt more like soft-porn. There was one sex scene that felt like it went on for TWENTY MINUTES.. I didn't clock it, but it sure felt like it to me. These scenes went WAY beyond T&A or tease. I actually felt uncomfortable watching some of these.3) Sadistic-torture porn. When Jason was around it felt more like a Saw movie, or maybe the remake of the Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Jason TORTURES his victims? Huh? Instead of a supernatural zombie he is more in line with a sadistic serial killer. a VERY different personality, and one that I felt was repugnant. In the original, Jason was alternately fun and scary. In this, he was just a sicko. Ugh.This pretty much sums up the movie for me. Oh, except one more thing. It looks like they used the lights over from AvP:Requiem. The scenes were TOO dark to see. And the Michael Bay 2-second scenes just made it worse! This wasn't some heavy cheap=CGI that had to be 'hidden' with low lit scenes and fast cutting!! I couldn't take it anymore.. And found myself fast forwarding to get through the picture.. Every time I played the movie it was one of the above 3 moods..I never thought I would appreciate the 1980 original so much. That was truly a brilliant piece of film-making compared to this.I have NO idea of who/why someone would like to see this.

222,zactac,An improvement on what has usually come out.,7,5 May 2010,"Once again we enter into the world of horror movie remakes and we all see the new vision the film-makers has for the film. Friday the 13th isn't so much a remake but more of a sequel. If you say its a remake then you probably wouldn't enjoy it very much. As a sequel it would definitely be a great improvement from what we've usually seen (like Part 7 and 8).This movie takes a different turn with the story and seems to mix parts 1 through 3 to create a different kind of Friday film. I'll admit this would probably be one of my favorite films in the franchise mostly because it doesn't do anything big to try and make it better (or just plain tacky) than it should be like add in a psychic girl or Frankenstein lightning. Instead it goes back to the old fashioned killer with a knife (or in this case machete) kind of film. While we know the story of Jason you would have to see this film because it starts a new story along with the addition of new characters.In short its about a guy going to Crystal Lake looking for his sister who went missing there (what a surprise). And there are some crazy young people looking for Jason to kill them. So besides the story of the missing sister its really the same kind of Friday movie. One thing that helped me enjoy the movie was that they gave Jason some-what of a personality (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). Things are done to this movie that really gave me a better perspective of the Friday films. While it has its problems I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel, which I will be walking into the theater with high hopes (but not to high in worry of a let down like Halloween 2 was).",Friday the 13th
223,Ingrouille181,"Mostly a well make remake, but still with a few problems",6,6 August 2019,"In terms of a horror remake, the 2009 Friday the 13th is an ACTUAL remake. Unlike all these Disney rehashes, and the 2010 Nightmare on Elm Street rehash, this REMAKE takes the source material and in large parts, makes it better than the majority of the original 1980's sequels. With some tweaks, this remake (surprisingly, even with it being produced by Michael Bay) could have been the basis for a whole new and fresh horror franchise every fan could enjoy and love.First off, Derek Mears as Jason Voorhees; great casting, and it's also great that they chose a guy who not only embodies the terrifying presence of Jason on screen, but a guy who LOVES the character of Jason Voorhees, who can sympathise with the character, and someone who didn't solely play the character for a pay check. This version of Jason is an apex predator and hunter, someone you believe has lived at Camp Crystal Lake for decades on his own, wearing whatever he could find, and surviving off the land. I also love the detail of Jason using underground passageways around the Camp, a GREAT explanation as to how Jason is able to suddenly appear out of nowhere. But still underneath all of that you can also see a slither of tragedy to the character that you don't get in the original sequels. Jason in the 2009 reboot gives you the same vibe as Norman Bates and his mother in the Psycho films.I really like the cinematography; like Star Wars it feels like a gritty, grimy lived in world. It feels natural with Jason, the Camp grounds. Even though sadly, half the characters are the stock, cliche tropes we've already gotten in these films, the other half feel like real people. Hopefully, if and WHEN we get another Friday the 13th film, I honestly hope they make it a soft reboot, with Mears as Jason, the same cinematographer, and the last thing I hope is that the screenwriter they get can make the majority (if not ALL) the characters feel fresh, relatable, interesting, and the type of characters you aren't just waiting to get killed off.Spoilers: In this movie, Jason takes one of the main characters, Whitney, as a hostage. To a lot of fans of the series, this came off as unbelievable and unreal. But as for me, I really like that idea, and it's a way for us to get into the psychology of Jason in this reboot; we don't see much of his face, but we know that beneath the killer, there's still that boy who 'drowned' in the lake. The ending is a smart callback to Friday the 13th: Part 3, and it's perfectly done by actress Amanda Righetti, who portrayed Whitney. The opening scene of her and her friends getting slaughtered by Jason was a perfect cliffhanger. It sets up the tone of who and what Jason is in this version.And SPOILERS again, for the ending, Jason is seemingly killed, and Whitney and her brother Clay, played great by Jared Padalecki, bury Jason in the lake. BUT! Jason springs back to life for one last surprise, leaving it on a cliffhanger. For many people who actually really like/love this instalment, it came off as purely lazy, and not organic to the flow of the story. While this version of Jason comes off as real and unstoppable, you still know he's just a human being. They should have either ended it with Whitney and Clay leaving the camp and Jason's fate truly unknown, or they should have taken the Jason death scene out entirely. Because the producers just couldn't help writing such a lazy cliffhanger in, in the hopes that this movie would gain enough money at the box office for a sequel, it ruined a mostly perfect retelling of the story even more.So, other than half of the main characters, specifically, the second group of kids including Travis Van Winkle's character Trent, being one dimensional dumb teenagers solely written to get killed off (except maybe for Danielle Panabaker's character Jenna; she and Padalecki have good chemistry together), and the STUPID cliffhanger at the end, this movie is a great example of how to retell a story, and a character, and make them both more engaging, and more realised. Hopefully, like I've said, we get another soft reboot, and get Derek Mears back in the Jason Voorhees role, and he gives us another great performance.",Friday the 13th
224,eytand94,Friday the 13th: A Remake That Is Surprisingly Lucky,9,20 November 2011,"Let's face it, shall we? Being one of the largest and most profitable franchises in history, the ""Friday the 13th"" movies are a series of films that are hilariously and entertainingly B-grade. Parts 1-4 were low budget with an almost no-name cast ((except for appearances by Betsy Palmer in part 1 and Crispin Glover & Corey Feldman in part 4), fantastic kills, and loads of nudity. The acting isn't Oscar-worthy, as most horror films aren't, but these movies, even going on to ""Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan,"" are ridiculously fun to watch. Basically, you're not a fan of horror if you don't like ""Friday the 13th."" However, the series was dying after taking its iconic villain, Jason Voorhees, through space and body possession. Was a remake needed? Perhaps. 2009 was a huge year for remakes, with the immensely enjoyable ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" and the extremely effective ""The Last House on the Left"" on the belt. But everyone was waiting for Jason to come back, after so much hype and some teases on the Internet. This was the first time in a while that a ""Friday the 13th"" movie was fantastic.Not exactly a remake, but more of an homage to the first few films, this ""F13"" begins with a prologue, summing up the ending of the first film. Fast forward 20 years later, and a group of horny, good-looking teenagers are camping around the mysterious Camp Crystal Lake in search of a crop of weed. Drugs are smoked, beers are drunken, and sex ensues. Then they are killed off one by one by an unknown assailant. We transition to a few months later, where another group of sex-crazed, illegal teens are taking a trip to their pompous friend Trent's cabin for some drinking games and nutty entertainment. While Clay Miller looks for his missing sister, Whitney, the party begins. The bad news for the teens is that they're in the wrong part of the woods. This is Jason Voorhees territory, and he's making it quite clear that they're not welcome.Inevitable but fun, this ""Friday the 13th"" was a blast for me. But like always, a Michael Bay remake gets trashed by purists of the original 1980 film. Some people just don't get it. The filmmakers are aware of the original ""Friday the 13th,"" or they wouldn't have made the movie. They respect it, and only want to pay homage to it, not act like the film never existed and try to take a beloved franchise into their own hands.The film has everything that the 80's series had and more: ignorant teens dropping their tops and not listening to the locals, drinking, drugs, good atmosphere, terrific murders, and surprisingly, the most intimidating and frightening incarnation of Jason Voorhees in 30 years.This Jason is the hard-core, furiously violent monster that some of the sequels failed to capture. In a disturbing game of cat and mouse, our villain throws little hints here and there that he wants to be left alone, and then inches his way towards his victims with an intelligent rage. He also takes a liking to the ways he kills people, which is something we've never seen in Jason before. He makes sure that his victims die a slow and painful death. The actual kill may still shock us, but it's who gets killed first and waiting for it to come that's the fun.Thanks to some good plot development and some great stoner comedy, most of the characters in the movie are likable, except for Trent, an arrogant tool that we love to hate. Chewie and Laurence are enjoyable re-imaginings of Jimmy and Ted from part 4, always cracking jokes and praying they get laid. And Clay's search for Whitney allows us to care about him and his sister enough to hope that they can fight Jason off.A good cast is in order here. Jared Padalecki is not given much to work with here, but he is always enjoyable to watch, thanks to some help from Danielle Panabaker. whose performance as Jenna is instantly likable. Aaron Yu is a joy to watch as Chewie, and the rest of the cast does fairly well also(who knew that you could care about a slut named Bree?).There have been several different actors to play Jason, ranging from Ari Lehman to the more popular Kane Hodder. For me, Derek Mears qualifies as one of my favorite Jasons. A tall and muscular actor, Mears brings a wonderful dread and creepiness to the character that makes us believe that he is Jason and that he can do major harm to us.The effects are very well-done and at times reminiscent of Tom Savini's effects for the original movie. All of the kills are delightfully 80's!Now, ""Friday the 13th"" is far from perfect. Like most horror teenagers, the characters make rather dumb decisions, say the wrong things, and go down the wrong shortcuts. The story needs a little work, and a little bit more insight into why Jason is killing (which we got a lot of in the series) would've helped. But when you compare Marcus Nispel's 2009 film with the likes of ""Jason Goes to Hell: The Final Friday"" and ""Jason X,"" this entry is welcome in my book. It is entertaining enough, scary enough, and respectful enough to meet the requirements of a good remake. And as always in the franchise, there are plenty of boobs. It's time that people started showing Michael Bay a little mercy and just accepted that his horror productions are good. I really liked this edition of ""Friday the 13th."" Consider it to be the opposite of what the title suggests: it's very, very lucky.",Friday the 13th
225,Milo-Jeeder,A witless comedy for teenagers with a killer on the loose,5,14 February 2009,"'Friday the 13th' turned out to be one of the biggest disappointments when it comes to horror classics remakes. After watching the trailers, I got the wrong idea that this film was going to be more serious. The previews gave me the false impression that this remake was going to go deeper into Jason's background story or maybe even offer extremely gory murders, when in reality, it is exactly the opposite. I'm not one of those horror lovers who want to know everything related to the villains, their origins and such, but in this case, it would have been acceptable to throw in some flashbacks regarding Jason Voorhees' past. Unfortunately, this remake wastes all the opportunities to make this interesting and instead, it offers an exaggerated and ineffective amount of comedy situations that are badly placed and ruin the possibility of creating a genuine horror feeling. Comedy situations in slasher films are no surprise, but in this remake, the attempted comedy is badly placed and seems like it was forced by the producers to make the film more marketable. I will give an example: after a really tense and dramatic persecution, the film cuts to a scene involving a horny stereotyped hillbilly lusting over a mannequin, while Jason silently walking up to him from behind, with the obvious intention of slashing him. How can they mix cheap humor and tension in one scene? The results obviously cannot be good. It was a murder scene, but instead of causing uneasiness, tension or shock, everyone at the movie theater was laughing at the guy talking about how he lost his virginity to a mannequin. The worst part is that the so-called humor is extremely 15-years-ago and even back then, it wouldn't have been funny.The gore is very unsatisfying also. Nowadays, slasher films usually offer creative and really brutal murders and even if the plot is not so good, you can always at least settle for that. When I found out that Marcus Nispel was directing this, I thought it was good news, because he directed ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" remake, which is a fine example of a movie that may not be as good as the original, but at least it offers something more serious, gory and overall fulfilling. Naturally, since Marcus Nispel also directed 'Friday the 13th' remake, I expected something in the same vein as 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake. Sadly, that was a very inaccurate assumption. In this film, the gore is completely unsatisfactory and in some cases, the murders are even funny. The entire movie theater burst into a maniacal laughter during some of the murders and I must say that in those cases, I had to agree with them. Another thing that bothered me about this film, is the fact that they could have showed a little bit more about the character of Mrs. Voorhees. Unfortunately, she only appears during the first seconds of the film and they cut her scenes with the opening credits, which is a disgrace. The confrontation between Mrs. Voorhees and the counselor girl is perhaps one of the finest points of the entire 'Friday the 13th' series, and it should have been remade in an equally tense way. Cutting the scene with the opening credits is, in my opinion, a self-sabotage. I think it's safe to say that many fans of the original film were eager to learn some more about Jason's beloved mother and see her more time on the screen. But no... apparently, they didn't even take advantage of that opportunity to make this movie more interesting. True, we see a little bit about Jason's environment, since the characters get to take a tour inside his house and it was a good idea to show his bedroom and evidence the fact that once upon a time, the killing machine was an innocent boy with a normal life. However, that doesn't make up for the lack of space that Mrs. Voorhees had on the story.'Friday the 13th' turned out to be a teen comedy with lousy humor and some badly placed murders from the beginning until the end. Watch it if you're curious, but unless you're a silly teenager who thinks everything is funny, don't expect anything even remotely good, because you'll be devastated.",Friday the 13th
226,alanrayford,Friday the 13th Part XI: More of the Same,4,21 June 2009,"I didn't get to see the ""Friday the 13th"" reboot in the theaters and had to settle for viewing the Killer Cut on DVD. Here's what I liked.Derek Mears did one hell of a job as Jason. He had no dialogue and we never see his face, yet he still managed to lend this icon a level of humanness never afforded him before. With all due Respect to Kane Hodder, his Jason was too direct and to the point about his intentions. This Jason, however, seemed to actually contemplate what he wanted with a person before ultimately deciding to butcher them. To me, this made him a little more organic and one hell of a lot scarier. Now, for what I didn't like.The rest of the movie and cast blew. And the worst part is that it wasn't the actors fault. Not one of them wrote their characters, and they could only follow the script. So I'm blaming the writer's for the majority of the cast being so pathetically unrealized as human beings. After watching the film, I don't even understand why most of the second batch of victim's were friends in the first place. They all seemed to dislike Travis Van Winkle's character, and he, in turn, didn't seem to really like them. And what was up with the Black guy and the Asian dude. I'm not saying they didn't belong, but seeing as how they didn't seem to have girlfriends or money, an explanation for them tooling around with a bunch of rich white kids in relationships was needed.Here's an example of what rubbish the characterization is. Jared Padalecki's character is at a gas station, in the boons, asking the cashier if he can post a picture of his missing sister. Then, for no reason, Travis Van Winkle's character starts harping on him. Now if I were way off the grid and saw a guy who was not only bigger than me, but appeared to be genuinely distraught over his missing sister, I'd give him space. In this movie, a simple decision that would've made sense and made a character somewhat more sympathetic was not the one made.Then there's Clay Miller, played by Jared Padalecki. If Padalecki is going to portray someone who is just average, then Clark Kent-ify him. Cut his hair, dress him in dweeb attire, and make him look like an underdog. Don't have him basically play Sam Winchester but without a clue. After four years of watching ""Supernatural"", it's just difficult to divorce him from Winchester without some changes being made to his appearance.Then there's the sex and violence. The violence was upped from the previous installments, yet it didn't have anymore impact. A woman is set on fire and a guy is impaled on the back of a tow truck. I wasn't impressed. The sex scenes were also ramped up and treaded into Skinemax, NC-17 territory. Regardless, while the actresses were quite attractive, these scenes only seemed to take away from what is supposed to be a horror movie.In short, Voorhees works. Without a cast of believable characters/victims, however, this film is just more of the same. I was left feeling disappointed, because this was supposed to be a re-imagining and not part eleven. Now since a review ain't worth spit without some kind of constructive criticism, here's the rest of my two bits.One, no more casts dominated by mid to late twenty something's playing college students/potheads/horn dogs/losers. We've seen enough of them over the years to the point where it's become cliché (kryptonite to horror). Increase the size of the cast from the typical seven to eight up to fifteen to twenty (some of whom are noticeably older and younger). This would increase the seeming randomness and unpredictability. After all, one effective and cost cutting technique is to hint that things are happening off screen. This shows that while nothing is seen, horrific acts, which will have an impact, are still occurring off camera. Make the majority of the larger cast more realistic and less a pack of ciphers. And, by realistic, I mean relatable. No one's going to care about the stereotypical nympho being skewered by a machete. But making her more even tempered, approachable, and less judgmental, would enable the audience to better connect with her, thereby making her violent, on screen farewell highly unsettling and suitable for this genre.Also, stop trying to make Jason Voorhees a human, woodland serial killer. It simply takes to many leaps of logic to explain away the boogeyman as a mildly deformed, regular guy. Instead, just embrace him as being a supernatural entity bound to the woods surrounding Crystal Lake. Maybe his mother was into the occult and brought him back from death after he drowned? But, when she brought him back, it turned out that something very, very bad tagged along with him. And as Jason got older, this thing exerted more and more control until little to nothing remained of her son.This little bit of Voorhees left could then be used to explain why he never seems to kill children. Maybe the monster inside wants to, but Jason simply won't allow it. Maybe have it where he won't kill pregnant women or mothers protecting their children either, because a mom protecting her young is something he can strongly relate to. But it would sure suck to be anyone else unfortunate enough to enter the woods and cross his path.Lastly, have it where key people in the town of Crystal Lake know all about Jason. At first they could try to ward people off. But once visitors have seen too much, even if they escape Jason, there's a whole town which will fiercely protect its darkest secret from getting out to the world. This way the franchise could have something too few horror films dare to—no survivors.",Friday the 13th
227,phoenixyk1,I dread reboots... But this ain't bad...,7,28 September 2014,"There are two words that fill me with dread when it comes to movies these days... MICHAEL BAY.The moment I saw his name in the credits... I was thinking ""OH DEAR GOD!""Thankfully, I was wrong to feel that way. While the film is not that great it does add some beautiful new elements to the story and has a great logical progression.Unfortunately, it is let down by a vain ""Let's give the audience what they want"" mentality... Obviously aimed at Horny teenagers, there is an over emphasis on getting drunk, getting stoned, and getting laid... COME ON Hollywood!!! IS THIS REALLY THE BEST YOU CAN DO???It has become so common in movies now it is ridiculous... It is very much like most are not even trying now as its easier to just flash some breasts to get the cash rolling in.Right from the outset, you get a great back story as Mrs. Voorhees is shown trying to kill the last Camp Counsellor only to be beheaded... But that is the first major issue!!!Jason witnesses her death - Yet Mrs. Voorhee's states she is taking revenge for her sons DEATH??? This scripting error is the most serious issue with the films logic.Once we get to present day, things do greatly improve - Locals appear to know of Jason's existence and try and urge people to stay away saying ""He just wants to be left alone!"" an such...Jason shows a vast knowledge of his habitat - Far from being some mindless crazed psycho, he is aware and lays traps. This lends a logic to the Townspeople and works brilliantly.He has even made a home and tunnel network for himself over his many years alone there - This makes great logical sense, and even though he never speaks - You begin to have a deeper understanding of him.Effects wise, The make up on Jason is amazing... And the killings - While stretching the illusions a little, make sense and are not overboard as is common with most horrors these days.With some serious plot holes, and the lack of suspense that made the original such an amazing film, I actually feel sorry that I could not grade this film an 8 - But this could indeed have been the fresh start that was needed.Well worth watching.",Friday the 13th

229,TamPalm,Good for what it is,7,14 February 2009,"I'm not a horror film aficionado, but I guess for what it is, this movie is a success. I sat in suspense throughout even to the point that I got a ""just go ahead and do it"" attitude after a while, as the suspense of waiting for Jason's next gory kill was a little too much for me at times. Also, what was too much was the sex scenes, very porno-ish. This movie is NOT for kids, you have been warned! Yes, this is a part of the fabric of horror films I suppose, but geez it gets uncomfortable ESPECIALLY when there are kids in the theater! It was just a little bit too much for me. And as far as being a ""date"" movie, maybe, but not a first date movie, those scenes make that a little too awkward I would think.But all in all, this movie is true to the Jason legacy I suppose and that's what counts most. 7 out of 10 for being a horror movie that really does produce horror in the audience, at least to a degree.

234,ARTaylor,The Best of the Friday the 13th Series,7,14 February 2009,"To any naysayers I say this: The Friday the 13th series were never all that great to begin with. The first was a rip-off of Halloween (the DVD material states that several times), and it just went downhill from there. They may have helped define the genre but none of them could be considered cinematic classics.I was actually quite surprised that I found this movie so entertaining. I'm a classic horror guy. I practically worship Carpenter's Halloween. I love the original Friday and Nightmare on Elm Street. I'm also pretty particular when it comes to horror. I have little love for sequels and remakes, and the only slasher flicks I've enjoyed since 1990 is Halloween H20 and New Nightmare. Like those, this is an excellent throwback to the slashers of the 80s.This movie did what Halloween H20 and New Nightmare did for those series, it brought it back to basics. Friday was getting too wild, too much crap building up. Jason's dying and coming back every single movie, battling psychics, going to Toronto, and facing off against Freddy. A far cry from that brutal, almost realistic original movie. The movie strips away all the fantastic elements. Now it's back to how it started off, a small group of young kids fighting a brutal killer.It's tense. It's scary. It's suspenseful. It's gory without being disgusting. It's really everything you could want from a slasher film. I remember sitting outside the theater waiting for the previous show to end and all at once like five people ran, running not walking, out of the theater and straight to the bathroom. It wasn't even over yet and they couldn't handle it anymore. At that point I knew I had to see the movie.The movie doesn't necessarily take itself seriously. Sure it's somewhat realistic but it acknowledges some of the slasher clichés. Like how the people who go off alone, drink, do drugs, and/or have sex die first. Or how the black guy complains about stereotypes just to fit them.I love all the references to the older movies. The prologue from the climax of the original (even taking place the same day as that movie), making this more of a remake of Part II. The bag mask from Part II. The barn from Part III. The siege of the house from Part IV. A form of the sleeping bag kill from Part VII.This is the best Jason. He's got that mysteriousness from the early movies but the strength and brutality from the later movies. Best of all he's intelligent. In the original series he mostly just appears, kills, and goes on to the next kill. Here, he tricks people, sets trap, uses victims to trap more victims. He's got an almost Michael Myers level intelligence.My only real complaint is the lack of interesting characters, a common problem throughout the series. Clay, Jenna, and Whitney are the only ones resembling dynamic characters. There's the guy who's a jerk for no reason other than to be a jerk. The girl whose only purpose in life is to have sex and die. You know, those typical horror stereotypes that have been done hundreds of times before.Fans of the series, see the movie. Fans of slashers, see the movie. Fans of horror, see the movie. It's fun, frightening, exciting. A great horror film. It doesn't reinvent the genre but like the Scream trilogy it makes slashers enjoyable again.",Friday the 13th

Roasting a camper in her own sleeping bag? Probably would have worked if the director didn't show her falling out of the bag already dead. Shooting with a bow & arrow? Wow, when did Jason turn into such a good shot? In fact, most of the deaths in this movie seemed to be taken from other horror movies, particularly 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'Halloween'! The lighting was terrible (I know it's supposed to be dark, but for God's sake, I couldn't see half of what was going on), the script was lousy... you know what, forget it.

Mommy Voorhees gets mad at the counselors for letting her son drown, she dies, Jason witnesses and then carries on her legacy. He kills with no mask, then finds the mask and kills some more.The first group of five characters include two couples and a nerdy whatever searching the area for weed to sell. What seemed like a ghost story to them about a killer at the camp told by the nerd, started coming true one by one. A few weeks later, a new set of characters including a jerk, his girlfriend, a couple, some other whorish girl, token black guy and funny guy take a trip to the jerk's family cabin looking a good time.While partying, a lone biker wanders around searching for his missing sister (who was one in the first five). The biker and girlfriend find Jason carrying a body to his camp area. As it gets dark, they start to fall prey one by one and not in the gory fashion as in ""Freddy Vs Jason"" but in a gruesome fashion.The only flaws I have was the nudity everywhere, and the fact there's always the same kind of cliché groups of people that wouldn't normally hang out together. Other than that, great slasher flick and date movie.7/10",Friday the 13th

240,Good-Will,Utter rubbish,3,18 February 2009,"I am old enough to remember the original Friday 13th, which was kind of groundbreaking for its time being one of the first ""Slasher"" films.That one wasn't very good, since the teenagers were so stupid that they deserved whatever they got, and this remake is just as bad, if not worse.Why this is No.1 at the US box office is presumably because people remember the original and hope that a remake (Updated to include modern technology such as GPS phones etc) might be slightly better.But it isn't. It's rubbish.Think of all the slasher movie clichés you can imagine and cram them into an hour and a half of stupefyingly bad decisions made by people who make your average two year old look like a genius and you have this piece of tripe.If it was a pastiche then that would be forgivable, but I actually think that it's meant to be a serious attempt to revive the franchise.Go see it, and then ask for your money back at the cashier.Unlikely that you will get it back, since you will meet with a blank look and a short response along the lines of ""Erm...why do you want your money back?

Jason didn't make his appearance until Friday the 13th 2! Would have it been so hard to remake it correctly? I mean they could have casted Cathy Baits, cause lets face it she is perfect for the part. (referance Misery) So technically this is the remake of Friday the 13th Part 2 but since it is a remake I guess it would be difficult to call it that and still have it as a remake I suppose. Though they could call it ""Friday the 13th the revision"" or just call it ""Friday the 13 part 11"" but why go through such turmoil. Why remake a picture that is pretty good as it is and is also ""IN COLOR"". I mean they where able to get away with the killer in the mask in the 80's but hasn't the audience grown since then? While we are at it, what is the reason for the Hockey mask. The whole point of killers wearing a mask is so that they cant get I.D.ed right? Does Jason re-e-e-e-a-a-a-l-y look like the kind of guy worried about the cops? And why a Hockey mask, is Crystal lake in Canada? I mean do you have any idea what a dead guy would have to go through to get a hockey mask. He had to pass, like, ten other things that he could have used for a mask until he got to Play it again sports and got a hockey mask. All of which being in incognito? Is the Hockey mask there so no one would realize that he is a dead guy so that he can hail a cab to get from place to place? Then again maybe that one is true in which case would explain the smell. I don't suppose its to look scary as lets face it a dead guys face is just not scary, not for today's kids and certainly not for the previous generation. Whats wrong with the actors face who plays him, I mean come on that's the guy you turn to look out over your shoulder for when going to an ATM. Also who plays hockey at an unfrozen lake anyway? The other thing, how did he get so big. He was a little drowned kid and went from that to this big guy who seems to know his way around everywhere. When I was Jason's age (when he died) I wouldn't know how to get to Chucky cheese if my parents didn't drive me! I know I must seem like I'm harping but I'm not, its just questions that I wonder about. But one must ask themselves why remake it? Despite the obvious that i pointed out about the old movie, it didn't really need to be remade. It was fun, mindless, entertainment. I love the originals and write it off as a product of the 80's and view it probably for nostalgic reasons. But trying to reinvent the franchise I mean come on, Freddy vs Jason was the best as far as closure goes and should have stayed there. But I suppose I would want to work on a Jason or Freddy movie myself so I cant blame them. Though this brings me back to the beginning, If they liked the first one so much why isn't his mom running around cracking heads?",Friday the 13th
243,cameron-kills-it,"Finally, A Remake That Didn't Bomb",5,23 February 2009,"""Friday The 13th"" is the story of a group of young people who are brutally massacred when camping near Crystal Lake. A few months later, a new group of kids, including one of the former kid's brother, goes to visit their friend who lives near the scene of the murder, however, they don't know that a murderer is stalking them and killing them. Okay, I thought for sure that this film was going to be horrible. Seriously, how could a remake of one of the most popular slasher flicks of all time be good? Well, I was wrong! It was surprisingly pretty good, and kept me entertained through the whole thing. The acting wasn't the best (Most of the women actors, besides Danielle Panabaker, were hired because they looked good naked, not because of their acting abilities.) The plot was okay, but I mean, hey, your expectations cannot be too high when you're watching a Friday the 13th, movie, you just have to go for the ride! All in all, it was a pretty good movie!Rated: R for Violence, Sex, Nudity, Profanity, and Drug UseGrade: C-",Friday the 13th
244,VenturousArtist,"""Even Angela Baker wouldn't sleep there.""",4,6 May 2014,"Once more, like other franchises that have tried to stay relevant and bring something new to the installments, this one had promises but failed on many things to prevent it from being the most credible in the series on good terms. Instead, the worst things had the most effort compared to what could have been done to make this 'remake' worth more of the viewers time than watching a flock of vultures eat a corpse.The story tells a series of events that occur in a location near a camp where a young boy was 'murdered' and returns as a serial killer to haunt anyone prancing around like he doesn't exist. If you expect the characters to be self-aware of their stupidity, or lack of teamwork, I can promise you they fail at both. In fact, out of the updated and colorful appearance of everything, the rest of the presentation is quite a failure as it focuses on nothing but every generic, overdone, and annoying stereotype from the past installments in the Friday the 13th franchise and any other 'horror movie' that attempts to pay homage or just has bad writing.So that begs one question: How did we get here? How did we turn the most decent idea into several failed presentations and think attempting it once more would make it any better? We know the story but it's not being portrayed correctly every time because it seems the writers can't make characters smart or strengthen the 'story'. If nobody can give Jason a proper introduction, sequel, or finale, then nobody should repeat the story at all! Camp Crystal Lake needs to be foreclosed and obliterated from existence...Even Angela Baker wouldn't sleep there.",Friday the 13th
245,TheDraytonSawyer,Not Bad Needed More Backstory Though,7,14 February 2009,"Well I saw the new Friday The 13th remake, or reimagining whatever you want to call it. The opening sequence felt really rushed. They should have showed a bit more of Jason's mother and more of little Jason. I think if they did that this movie would have been great. It wasn't a bad movie; it just needed more back story imo. I liked the way Jason looked though, he was very cool in this one. Much better than the Jason from Freddy VS Jason. The teenagers were your typical sex, drugs, dumb and most of them got killed off. I'm actually glad they killed off the Asian guy he was very annoying. I didn't mind the main girl character and the guy that was looking for his sister. I think they were the best actors in the movie, next to Derek Mears. The movie was fairly violent and pretty gory. Jason is still one mean killing machine in this one. He actually runs in this one too. The last fight scene with Jason was pretty good. I like how they showed his face too. He's one ugly son of a gun that's for sure. I look forward to the sequel if they make one.I give Friday The 13th a 7/10",Friday the 13th

247,kyleallen_9,Welcome Back to Camp Blood,10,16 February 2009,"This movie kicked major ass! personally i think that it surpassed Jason X and Freddy Vs Jason. The fact that this movie was produced by Michael Bay, who brought us the two latest Texas Chainsaw Massacres and The Unborn and The Hitcher, is enough for anyone to go see it. I mean it just had this feeling like i was watching one of the original Friday the 13ths. This movie kicked off with Amanda Righetti, America Olivo, Jonathan Sadowski and Ben Feldman wind up disappearing near the boarded up camp crystal lake. Not that long after, his sister is missing, Jared Padalecki ends up going to look for her and comes across a group of young college students Danielle Panabaker, Travis Van Winkle, Julianna Guill, Willa Ford, Ryan Hansen, Aaron Yoo and Arlen Escarpeta, who are spending the weekend at a summer house. When the friends decide to help him look for his missing sister and her friends, they come across camp crystal lake and end up encountering a fierce killer, named Jason Voorhees. This movie opened with a bloody bang and doesn't let up into the gory ending. So, hold on to your seats as you witness the rebirth of one of America's favorite horror icon. I cant wait for a sequel!!",Friday the 13th
248,Critomaton,Michael Bay creates a new acronym: CHIRGO,1,15 February 2009,"It stands for ""Classic Horror In, Re-imagined Garbage Out"". You can substitute ""Camp"" or ""Crap"" for the C, depending upon how you feel about the original ""Friday the 13th"" - the rest of the acronym remains the same.The re-imagined ""Friday the 13th"" isn't scary. It isn't creepy. It isn't suspenseful. It isn't funny at any point, and it's only the slightest bit sexy. It doesn't add anything to the Jason mystique or, for that matter, to the ""unstoppable boogeyman"" archetype in cinematic horror. The characters in this flick are so one-dimensional they make all the throwaway performances from previous installments of the series look positively Oscar-worthy. And that includes episodes 5-9, which are hard to beat on the Unwatchable Meter.As many have noted, the lighting in a lot of scenes is bad. This is probably done for realism, but frankly it doesn't detract too much because you never feel like there's much to see anyway. Likewise for the relatively sparing use of shakycam.Considering all the things they might have updated 29 years later, there really seems to have been little thought put into this movie. Yeah, there's more sex and nudity than in the original installments, but it doesn't seem that over the top and it definitely isn't titillating. Most of it is accompanied by insanely annoying dialogue.There are plenty of scenes that will make you cringe and groan for their stupidity, but I don't want to include any spoilers, so I'll skip them.Instead, I'll just mention the two most memorable non-spoilers:1) There is gratuitous use of sudden loud noises to create shock or suspense when none would otherwise exist. Lots of movies do this when they can't be scary - I can't think of another one that does it so often or so loudly.2) There is also a major preoccupation with weed. Was ""Pineapple Express"" that big a hit? If there is any horror in this movie at all, it is that Amanda Righetti and Willa Ford felt it necessary to star in it to advance their careers.This movie does to the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise what ""Quantum of Solace"" did to James Bond. I hope Bond can be revived somehow. I no longer have the slightest interest in the goings-on at Camp Crystal Lake.",Friday the 13th

To me it was excellent & stuck to the same formula as the originals but with a few things done better . This Friday movie was more like a remake of part 2 with a bit of part 3 thrown in where Jason gets his hockey mask , it was very much more hard edged than the originals & scarier with an awesome 13 kills ! . If you have never seen a Friday the 13th movie then I suggest you see the very first original & then go see this new "" Remake "" because the remake follows on from where the original concludes it's just set some 20 plus years later so in other words if you ignore every Friday movie made after the first film then this would be your sequel . People please ignore the negative reviews because this move is classic Friday the 13th & far better than most of the horror remakes we are getting these days , if you liked the originals you'll love this one & if your not even a fan you'll love this one ! great suspense , great horror & great kills "" you can't ask for more than that .",Friday the 13th

So if this is what you look for in the horror genre, then i would seriously avoid this film at all costs.Being an old school horror fan, this movie was more like a soft porn film with blood than anything else. The nudity had nothing to do with the narrative or plot and the producers seemed to be on a mission to beat the Guiness Book of Records for the most murders in one film.Friday the 13th is a classic horror film and the only similarity it had to this 2009 version was the fact they used Camp Cyrstal Lake and the notorious Jason. If it did not use this classic film for these aspects then it may have appealed to me more. The gore at parts was realistic and although not original, there were some intense moments.I would like to say the film producers made a good effort to modernise one of the best horror films of all time, but I find that what was offered on the big screen, nothing more than a mediocre excuse to promote promiscuous teens and lack of imaginative insight.",Friday the 13th

The original did such a great job with building the tension, fear, and suspense. We saw Jason stalking his victims and the music was there to intensify the sheer horror of that. It just wasn't there in this remake. Jason was just there. You rarely see him getting there and that's part of the fun! And the scare! I rarely felt scared during the duration of the film. It's sad because it was set up pretty well, with the location and the characters, but it fell short. I'm glad that I gave it a shot, but I'll stick with the originals.",Friday the 13th

I loved every single one of those stupid movies (yes, even Jason X and Jason Goes to Hell). They weren't good movies, but they were fun as hell to watch.This remake really got me down. First of all, the kills were pretty unimpressive - especially with the lack of makeup used on them but instead CGI blood and gore was used.The picture is so dark most of the film that it's hard to tell what's happening on screen most of the time. Not to mention the standard slasher film formula this film follows. Instead of doing a remake, they should've just done another sequel. That would've made me extremely happy instead of serving us this crap.Remakes are like the bubonic plague. No one wants them, but they still keep coming. As long as directors like Marcus Nispel and producers like the bag of sh!t Michael Bay keep making movies, then that's exactly what we're gonna get.",Friday the 13th
255,adam_uk09,A disaster!,4,14 February 2009,"2009 is the year of Horror, or that is what we've all been told by the media. I thoroughly enjoyed 2007's edition to the Halloween franchise; the film, directed by Rob Zombie added something new to a dying breed of films: suspense! 2009 arrived, with titles like Final Destination 4, My Bloody Valentine and Saw 6 on the horizon, as well as a sequel to Halloween; entitled H2, it promises to be a good year for the genre.Friday the 13th follows in the footsteps of the Halloween franchise, a classic horror being remade to ensure that 21st Century audiences get a taste of Jason Vorhees, as has already been done with Michael Myers.Obviously, no remade film can match the simplicity and clarity of the original, but Zombie's Halloween certainly got close to John Carpenter's masterpiece.Unfortunately, Friday the 13th didn't come within a stones throw of the original; all that was there was a repackaged Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but being from the same family as that remake, I was expecting some similarities. However, the amount of them was completely unforgivable. Jason was lost in a mess between trying to get it like the original and Texas Chainsaw.The young actors/actresses performed well in their limited roles and there was a deal of suspense, not a lot; but enough for a few shocks every now and then. On the other hand, the amount of nudity in the film was completely unnecessary; one scene in particular was not needed.Jason himself was impressive, very well made up and Derek Mears performed very well. Unlike the Halloween remake, F13 decided to stay well clear of giving the character a back-story so that Jason didn't get too much sympathy. There are scenes that show he isn't just a non-stop machine however. Unfortunately, I think a back-story would've given the film much more depth.Overall, F13 is everything a modern horror film shouldn't be; messy, disorganised and lacklustre in nearly every way possible. You're probably wondering why from my review it got a mark of 4; that's because the effort put in to making the film shows on screen, unfortunately it just doesn't work.",Friday the 13th
256,rynlarson,A misguided remake that could have been so much more!!!,6,7 June 2009,"Lets start with the beginning. A 3 minute catch up on the death of Jason's mother. Poor lighting, poor direction, lack of imagination. People knock Jason Goes to hell but at least at that time Adam Marcus (who was only 20 years old) livened things up a bit and had some style to his Friday. The pre-credit kills also lacked imagination (we've seen it all before). The references to the previous sequels were enjoyable but what lacked was the Jason of old. I was OK with the fast, brutal Jason but there was no suspense. The last 1/2 hour is quality as the filmmakers take you through Jason's underground lair but even that was a stretch for mongoloid, zombie Jason to have. I was not aware he was an electrician. I had looked forward to this but left the film disappointed. Check out ""Last House on the Left"" if you want a quality remake, or reboot as it were. I even re-watched Freddy versus Jason and enjoyed that much better. I hope the sequel improves.",Friday the 13th
257,amazing_sincodek,"Screw you guys, I liked it. No blood, no Kane hodder...but an interesting and coehesive mythos.",8,20 June 2009,"I was kind of ambivalent about the fact that I liked this movie so much, but then I saw that it was the highest rated on IMDb since part 1. I wouldn't go that far, but I agree it is one of the better entries in the series.It was marketed as a ""reboot"" rather than a remake, and I think this is appropriate. The Jason mythos as we have previously known it was developed through a series of afterthoughts and coincidences, and it was only a matter of luck that it evolved into something awesome. For example, Jason himself was a creation of Tom Savini, who suggested that Jason's appearance would be a cool ending to the first film. Jason's seeming immortality only became part of the mythos when fans got upset about his absence from part 5, and studios decided that he had to rise from the grave.Thus, though the fan has a cohesive picture of Jason's story, no single film presents a complete portrait. That's where this film shines. It draws from the ideas of the entire series and presents them all in a unified 97 minutes (and I do mean 97 minutes--don't bother with the 'killer cut' DVD). The biggest punch comes in the first 20 minutes, summarizing the first two films before showing the title screen, and featuring the coolest sleeping bag death in the whole series.There's also a depth to this film that I wasn't expecting (nor where the creators intending it--I think it was an accident). In previous films, Jason represented the hurt, vindictive, ugly, angry side of the viewer. We cheered for him so that we might vindicate ourselves vicariously. The ""jerk"" always died a terrible death, and the ""good"" girl usually survived. This was awesome, but a bit shallow.Without spoiling anything, I will say that Jason is no longer such an adolescent indulgence. Instead, he is a champion of death itself: inevitable, indiscriminate. He doesn't care who you are. The question in this film is not who will die, but rather how the characters will react when confronted with the possibility of death. The highest point in the film, IMO, is at the intersection of Jason, Chewie, and Laurence.As far as I can tell, the two biggest criticisms this film has received from fans are that there is too little gore and too many bared breasts. Permit me to argue against these criticisms: first, the Friday the 13th movies have NEVER been gory. Ever. This isn't the series for gorehounds. The only film to be immediately available uncut was part 9, which fans reject as not a true entry in the series. Second...really? You're complaining about breasts? I have nothing to say to you.Some closing thoughts: the film fizzles out a bit after the spectacular opening. Jason himself looks pretty darn cool in my opinion, especially with the potato sack over his head, but doesn't get as much screen time as he should. The ""filler"" component of the film is as good as it's ever been, with some genuinely funny dialogue and one or two worthwhile characters. By mainstream standards, the characters are still pretty stupid, but I don't think fans of the series really have anything to complain about.",Friday the 13th

259,mntwister,Who cares when a bunch of drug addicted sex addicts die? C'Mon Paramount!,3,18 June 2009,"What we have here is basically a soft core porno film in the first half and it seems the screenwriters went out of their way to outnumber the times the F word is used and a bunch of characters that care about nothing but partying and sex and drugs, so who cares if they die?. While most of the older filmswere about teens getting killed, and many during sex, I don't think they needed to go this far. Might as well have made it X and showed everything. In my opinion, the continuous swearing and talk about sex and the drug use really cheapened this film. There were no characters to really care about. I am no prude, I can handle sex scenes and some swearing, but this was ridiculous.How disappointing. The movie opens well enough, like the first with the killings and then the titles (though the titles on the first movie were better). The music was not as good as the first, in my opinion the original Friday the 13th had a real orchestra and that combined with the slow motion at the opening and the titles coming out at you made for a much better opening.I liked the way Jason found the mask and I liked the fact that they told us what happened to Jason and why. But I feel there was so much missing. Camera angles of Jason were lame, and in some instances I thought he was weak, which he never was before. When the guy starts to fight and punch him, and Jason falls back a few times, I knew this was not the same Jason I knew. I only heard the ""kill kill kill ha ha ha"" at the start once, and then at the end once. That is a trademark of Jason and alerted viewers to the fact Jason was near. They chose not to use it very much (in fact not at all during the film except for the start and end) and I am unhappy about it. I am also unhappy with the music score. I feel this could have been much scarier with a more intense music score with some REAL instruments (likePsycho and the first Friday the 13th).The killings were inventive, but the characters were very lame and you really don't care if they are killed, because they are a bunch of losers..except for one of them who you do care for, and they kill that one off. Whatever happened to developing characters that you actually care about, which makes it much harder and scarier to see them killed? That's good film-making. They really had no build-up to discovering Camp Crystal Lake, which is a legend for those who know this series... the final scare was nowhere near as jolting as in the first film, and the characters were all drug addicted sex addicted losers. That's fine but it does nothing for the audience when you could care less if they die or not.What a shame they chose this route. It could have been SO much better. Many of the first 6 sequels are much better than this one, watch those instead. They had a great opportunity to start the series over again. I think they failed miserably.",Friday the 13th

I didn't enjoy it too much, but one thing I did enjoy about this movie is it made me want to go back and watch the original 3 films again.I watched this flick with my girlfriend and I can't say it was much fun. I can remember going to the theater watching a Friday the 13th flick and you would laugh and cheer as Jason went after the ASSHOLE characters you hated. Or woopin and hollerin as Jason approached and couple of kids playing hide the salami. There's none of that here. You won't cheer, you won't woop. Even the characters who are assholes you feel sorry for because Jason is so brutal and unrelenting...and quick. There isn't a whole lot of suspense here folks. For the most part when Jason sets his sites on you, your caught and sometimes tortured (Since when does Jason torture people?) quick like.

It has NO story. Strike that. All horror flicks have no story, but this one doesn't even have a narrative or whatever you wanna call it. It's just two dozen people getting split from the herd and killed. Usually slasher flicks have a couple of people fighting for survival, but this one just disposes of them quickly. Really quickly. And not even terribly gory.And that Jason feller is a ninja. He is EVERYWHERE. He never makes a sound, although he is a 8'0"" tall guy, weighing about 240 lbs. and wearing army boots, but he sneaks like a cat - unless he wants to scare people with noises. And he's pretty agile too, appearing in places the protagonists looked in just 2 seconds ago. He's so sneaky and stealthy, I bet he's a master lockpicker at level 10 or higher.To save the movie, there's nudity. Three girls put out. Two aren't all that pretty and have fake boobs, but the last one is awesome. Then again, if I'm after tits, I'll just get me some porn.I'm just glad I gave that ""The Forgotten Ones"" disaster 3/10 stars, so I can give this one here 2/10 (and reserve the 1/10 for Uwe Boll)...",Friday the 13th

Again like that Batman, I was looking forward to the new Friday the 13th hoping a fresh look might bring new life to the slasher classic.Well, at least The Dark Knight was good.For those who don't know, Friday the 13th is set in and around an abandoned summer camp called Crystal Lake. A tragic event at the camp years before has resulted in Jason, a mute, goalie mask wearing killer lurking about the woods ready to slice up anyone who appears to be having a good time.As I mention in my title, the new Friday is more of the same. Campers coming to present day Crystal Lake to party and look for pot only to encounter Jason, who, I guess has been just hanging around for 30 years waiting for someone to drop by. Lots of blood and then the opening title of the film.Ahhh, just the beginning.Next we have even more young attractive people turning up and again being cut down one by one in different and inventive ways. Do I sound bored? Let's put it this way, when the cliché rich collage guy and the equally cliché troubled outsider have the exact same look and haircut you soon realize more time was taken worrying about fashion then story.The new Friday the 13th offers little real suspense, horror, humour or even fresh insight into the Jason character. Oh wait, there is a new if illogical feature, it seems Jason has not only taken the time to build an underground bunker complete with tunnels and floodlights (guess Crystal Lake Water and Power are pretty casual about people paying their bills) but is able to conceal it all from the local police during their occasional searches for missing campers.I wasn't expecting Hamlet, but considering this was a lot of the same people who did the remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre I was expecting much, much more.",Friday the 13th
267,TomConnors,What were they thinking?,3,9 February 2011,"I won't waste much time on this movie. It's a mess from beginning to end, and they missed a great opportunity to resurrect a true horror legend.The original 1980 film is compressed into a few minutes of black and white footage, where we are supposed to understand that some crazy lady is chasing a girl through the woods. Something happens, it's dark and rainy, and this lady gets her head chopped off, and some freaky looking kid see's this happen.Now I know who these people are, because I've seen the original, but anyone who doesn't, has to be completely lost.The movie goes even more downhill from there, we are then subjected to a 20 minute or so pre-title story of a few teens who enter Jason's woods to be hacked off one by one, or at least most of them. Then even more people are introduced who we don't get to know or care about, to be hacked off one by one. The filmmakers just didn't get the originals, yes they had a list of a lot of things that were in those movies, and things they wanted to amp up, but I don't think they got what the soul's of those old movies were like.Don't waste your time on this.",Friday the 13th
268,carolinephillips-47427,"Well shot, but uninteresting slash 'em up.",3,12 March 2017,"I grew up with the Friday the 13th series. I enjoyed them. My friends enjoyed them. They were the perfect slumber party movies. Granted, they were never great art or known for their brilliant performances or stellar writing, but they did their job and supplies a couple of jolts and fun set pieces.Going into this remake, I'd hoped to at least be entertained, but after the admittedly terrific prologue, I started to lose interest. The characters are horrible human beings with no redeemable characteristics at all and I, for one, couldn't wait to see them get offed.Now, in the past Friday films, you always had characters who were annoying or bitchy, but they usually gave you one or two interesting or likable characters to roots for. I can think of Tommy, Trish, Ginny, Alice, Megan, etc. This film has none. They're all awful people, so the suspense is dulled, because you're not on the edge of your seat, hoping they get away. Instead, you're twiddling your thumbs, waiting for Jason to take these idiots out so that you can go home.They even has Jason taking hostages in this and creating his own military-style fortress with flood lights and booby traps. That's not Jason.The whole thing is a big missed opportunity. Save your money.",Friday the 13th
269,drnrg31,New look on an old classic,8,21 June 2009,"I'll straight out say that I have chosen the spoiler option, because it's very hard to review this movie without mentioning key parts of the movie. There are many things I liked about this remake. Actually the word remake is not correct. It's more like an overhaul of the original 4 first parts of the series. Like I said; there are many aspects about the movie that I really enjoyed, but there are a few which I completely despise. One being how Jason finds his hokey mask. A six year old could have came up with a better scenario than the one used here, but first the things I liked about the movie- 1. Interesting way to combine the first four chapters, while at the same time adding in a few twists. Most notably the first 15- 20 minuets. It's almost a mini version of parts 1 & 2. Actually part 1 was to already have taken place, since we are introduced to Jason's mom being beheaded in the first 5 minuets. the first group of campers are offed very nicely in the first 15 minuets of the movie with one of those actually being spared. I will get to that in the second half of the review. The gore is nice and the kills are very gruesome...and of course we get some T&A to make the formula believable. If you have seen the Bloidy Valentine remake, then you can compare those two beginnings.2. Not a comedy: This is indeed good horror with the proper atmosphere in a horror movie. Think back to part 6; which for me was when the original series became a joke. The five campers playing paint ball and the fact that Jason started killing in broad daylight was the darkest day in Friday history. You won't get any of that in this movie. No one dies in plain daylight and while there will be a few characters who add comic relief; there time of demise is never a joke.3. Acting; I liked it. To me there was good character development. At least in the second group of campers there was. Chewy, Laurence, Clay and even the obnoxious Trent were all fun to watch. There characters are likable, but not so much that one will cry when there time is up.4. Backstory: I'm not usually a fan of this, but this one told the story in a pretty convincing way. We actually get to s4e the young Jason see his Mother decapitated and go retrieve her remains. This certainly shows his maniacal vengeful ways on unsuspecting campers.5. The Kills: very original and exciting ways to die. Pay close attention since the majority either expand or give a new twist to older killings. The killings never truly seem rehashed and that's why they are very effective. Theree is also plenty of blood and gore for the hounds to admire.6. Attractive cast: here is where they borrow from part 4, since it also had a very attractive and well known cast. This remake has very nice female as well as male actors they they stay true to what teens in horror movies do. Drink ,have sex , and party.7. Jason: I really did enjoy the new Jason a lot. Kane Hodder did an excellent job in the Friady series, but towards the end he started to become the butt of the joke. Here we have a new Jason. This one seems to be actually pretty smart for he constructs some sort of underground tunnels for easy access in surprising the never ending group of campers who just seem to be to brave for their own good....things I didn't like: 1. the mask: As I already mentioned, I really despise how Jason comes across his iconic facial apparel. It really turns out to be a great let down, since the way he finds it: reveals nothing new nor exciting. It's a also a real sorry way to insert one of the most bile characters in the series. Some backwards inbred F**K who has sex with mannequins. I was only too happy to see him go. Here is where Jason finds his mask. Literally; he just finds it under some materials in the barn. Epic fail in my book.2. Jason keeps a hostage: never in his dead life has Jason ever opted to keep a victim alive. He just has no use for them. Herew is seems that he actually feeds her to remain strong enough. We never quite figure out Jason's intention, only to add on another storyline behind the Storyline. It could also be to insert the ""looking for my missing sister"" theme? Either way the sister in question; Whitney, must have really sweet talked Jason into not killing her, because in the first 15 mines of the movie we last find poor Whitney seconds away from being sliced and diced. Did Jason stop his machete in mid air and say ""I think I'll keep this one?"" I think not.LOL Those were the only two aspects that I really despised form the movie, but over all, I thought it was one of the better remakes in the last few years. Between this and the Valentine's remake; I prefer this one. Incidentally both this and the aforementioned Bloody valentine feature the two main actors from the series Super Natural in lead roles. Coincidence? What I'm really hoping for is a remake of parts 5-10, with part five being totally eliminated this time around. That's the one, where Jason isn't even the Killer. What I would like is for this new remakes to completely hack away the tongue in cheek humor of those movies and just stick to good ogle horror. Do that and your half way there.",Friday the 13th
270,worldpieceprod,"The ""Part 5"" I always wished for",9,13 February 2009,"Way back in 1985 I watched in confusion as the favorite horror series from my childhood took an awful and unexpected turn for the worse. FT13th 5: The New Beginning truly was the beginning of the end for the king franchise of all slasher films. Year after year and decade after decade the sequels continued rolling out. These were often fun films and not a bad way to waste 90 minutes (with the exception of part 8 which is simply unwatchable). However, it seemed that the further away the formula strayed from its roots the more irrelevant and pointless our beloved Jason character became. Sadly, after 24 years of dedication and pure devotion to the art of slashing, Jason was no longer scary. He had become more of a joke than anything. An unstoppable zombie with all the boredom of such a title. Gone was the mystery and thus the fear of a vengeful and deformed retarded redneck with a serious attitude problem. I personally think the Kane Hodder sequels of FT13th are comparable to the George Clooney sequel of Batman. This has all changed my friends. Jason is BACK! And with him comes a whole new list of questions and mystery. He is no longer supernatural which is exactly why he is once again frightening and as terrifying as he once was way back in the 80's. There is nothing to say about this film other than it was awesome and it simply maintained the exact formula of parts 1 through 4, this is why it rocked! It gave us a glimpse of the past and also raised some questions of the present and a possible future. SPOILER ALERT: Jason seemed far more productive and busy in this installment than we've ever known him to be. He was clearly up to something here as far as a career path was concerned and also protecting his investments. They also eluded to some possible contact with the locals. Hmmmm......",Friday the 13th

You have teens in the woods, masked madman Jason terrorizing them, and a variety of semi-creative death scenes. What it forgets are the relatable characters from some of the original and best-loved entries in the franchise. Because of this, we're stuck rooting for Jason to kill everyone in sight because we're sick of hearing them talk and that makes for a dismal viewing experience.",Friday the 13th
272,rhaynes1974,Distinctly Average,5,6 July 2013,"Friday the 13th (1980) was a watershed film. Essentially it made the slasher sub-genre profitable and a string of pale imitations were made between 1980 and 1985.The new retread of Friday the 13th (2009) feels very much like one of these imitations. It's not even as much fun as some of the worst sequels in the Friday the 13th franchise. (Parts V and VIII spring to mind)While not a terrible film this remake feels lazy. The character development is lazy, the exposition feels lazy and even the gore is lazy. This is film-making for the smart phone generation.While the original is by no means a ""Godfather"" like classic it does retain a cult-classic status all of its own. This charm is what's lacking in the modern version. The producers have seemingly ticked all the boxes; boobs, blood and banging, but, it's all very slick, overly polished and a little lifeless.This new retread retains none of the suspense, the surprise or even the grit of the original. While the production values are definitely higher, what modern film-makers don't seem to understand about remakes is that it's the very low budget nature of these films where they derive so much of their charm.While Marcus Nispel is a more than competent film-maker and his own remake for The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is in fact very good, this one misses the mark for me. It's distinctly average at best.",Friday the 13th
273,mathijsschaap,Derek Mears makes Jason terrifying again,9,8 July 2017,"I do not understand the hate for this movie. I really don't.Back in the eighties I was more of a Freddy Krueger fan instead of being a Jason Voorhees fan, but Kane Hodder as Jason in part VII 'The New Blood' made all the difference.Two years ago I wanted to make a Dutch video for YouTube in which I reviewed ALL Friday the 13th movies, so I watched all of them again. And the original movies, especially the first four of them, were quite bad. Betsy Palmer made a terrible performance in the first one and the actors as Jason in Part II, III and IV were walking like a Frankenstein monster, because they were unable to move their neck due to the heavy prosthetic latex make-up on head, neck and shoulders. The special effects were really bad and obviously fake. The acting was quite bad also. Back then, there was not one good Friday the 13th movie in which Jason Voorhees was just a mortal man.Derek Mears made all the difference in this reboot/remake. Even though I missed the crazy elder man that we saw in the original first two movies, this is a good movie. Derek Mears made Jason Voorhees terrifying again. The mortal Jason, that is, because this is a reboot of the first 4 original movies. For as far as I'm concerned, only two actors did Jason Voorhees justice: Derek Mears as the mortal Jason and Kane Hodder as the immortal/supernatural zombie that Jason became from part VI and on. I didn't like the movies after part VII (Jason in Manhattan? Jason in space? Did they steal stories from the Muppets or what?)The acting is good, Jason with a sack over his head this time does not look like 'The Elephant Man', special effects are convincing and stand the test of time. This IS a good movie! Haters are just hating this movie because of their own personal emotional-psychological reasons.Whenever I think of Jason Voorhees movies, I think of part VII 'The New Blood', because this is my all-time favourite from the old days and this movie. I cherish them both...",Friday the 13th
274,sumana-m21,Sucks!,2,28 June 2009,"**********Spoiler Alert************* Acting was bad. In fact it was terrible. Setting was usual. Jumpy scenes, yes there were quite a few. But something was missing from this movie that didn't totally make it rock. Maybe people are just tired of the same ole' same ole'.If you're watching this movie straight out the first time, you still may not like this one. I feel most Friday the 13th sequels have the same to give. Bunch of kids, camping in the middle of the woods, hear the creek creek noise, you see the hockey masked guy appearing out of nowhere staring at you in the woods.If you were a fan of the earlier 80's movies, I can see why you may not have liked this one just as much. It turned out to be a little short, scary scenes were dragged on at times and were not really scary.. just boring.Jason was not intimidating at all. He was sort of funny to watch. They did a terrible job at showcasing the jumpy scenes. It became very dramatic and predictable, which ultimately makes you YAWN!The opening scene lasted so long that I forgot it was the opening scene of the movie. And how on earth did Jason know how to set traps, kidnap people and keep them tied underground? How did Whitney last so long without proper air, food and water? Did Jason cook for her or something? And he couldn't figure out that she was too young to be his mother? Ridiculous story. I remember watching an earlier 'Friday the 13th' series movies and I was so frightened after the whole movie got over that it simply kept recurring the week after. This movie does not do any of that. It's so lame. Please don't watch it on DVD either, its really not worth it!",Friday the 13th

I wasn't really expecting anything from it but having seen all the other Friday the 13th movies i thought why not?!. But yeah it was decent.It's stuck true to the original and hasn't branched away from the story etc. at all to be honest which i suppose is quite a good thing. The gore looks very good in the film , none of that camera turns away blood up the wall stuff. When it happens it happens and you see it cool eh? All the characters are played just right the actors involved can't act but it's a horror film.It's really weird because although in parts predictable being a re-make n' all it caught me off guard a fair few times and had EVERYONE in the cinema jumping out of there seats and people even screaming! Jason is as terrifying as ever and as a Friday 13th fan it was great fun to watch i was interested to see what direction they'd take it in. At the same time anyone looking for a good horror film would really like this too.Overall it's good fun , jumpy looks great on the big screen and is well worth checking out at least. OK so the re-make isn't as good as it should be and re-makes aren't' finally back on track but it's a step in the right direction and is definitely one of the best re-makes done of a horror film to date.Only criticism would be i felt it relied to much on the loudness and the sound in general , way too many of the big scares wouldn't have scared without this making it slightly weak in those areas.Give it a chance and you might enjoy.6/10",Friday the 13th

The movie was loaded with gratuitous boob shots. I have no problem with nudity but when it's only there to draw in a certain demographic, it's annoyingly obvious.Clay, Whitney, and Jenna were the only characters worth watching and were well acted.

277,leorican,Fertilizer pure and simple,1,14 February 2009,"OK so this remake / re-imagining / ripp off or what ever you want to call it is basically a mish mash of the first several films. It starts off by giving you one of the worst openings ever with a quick crunched up visit to the original goings on from the original FT13. Soo bad I rolled my eyes so far back they almost stayed there. As a matter a fact I rolled my eyes through this whole ordeal. And let me just say Nana Vistor has no business trying to fill in the shoes of the great Besty Palmer as ""Mrs. Vorhees"". Now jump some 20 odd years later and we see a group of hikers go into the woods near the old Camp Crystal Lake. Of course they run into old Jason who then...well take a wild guess. Now its six months later and this Ambercrombie & Fitch model type dude runs into this other group of annoying teens while looking for his missing sister who was with the previous group. Incidentally her fate is one of the most dumb and ""how did she....."" moments in the film...and there are many...like, why after after all this time does Jason suddenly pop out now and it appears that some of the locals ( an old bitty mostly ) knows that old Jason haunts the woods. Why hasn't anyone searched for this crazy killer before? How come the police never came across him in the old deserted camp that according to this movie has been deserted for 20 some years and was most likely visited by the search party after the first group of dumb teens went missing. Hello, no one bought the land to build...the owners never sold it?? Didn't anyone notice all the odd things in the camp. The list goes on. Anywho the rest of the film is so bad and predictable it hurts. You have to sit through the poorly executed slayings that show no imagination or thrill. There is no mystery or real story here. No ""whats in the dark"" buildup like the original did so well. The famous ""ki-ki di-di ma-ma"" is only barely heard in the beginning, middle and then the end. The rest of the time you hear what appears to be left over music from the Texas Chainsaw Masscre remake...And where the heck was crazy Ralph??? Before seeing this I had hopes that they would do it justice. Instead they insulted the first two films ( which were the only real good entries although in part 2 the whole Jason was really alive thing was never really delt with in a plausible way and it took away from Mrs. Vorhees's revenge motive).The opening was a dead give away that this would be a total crap fest. I almost went and asked for my money back but somebody else had bough me my ticket. When I heard Danielle Panabaker had been cast in this and I thought OK now there is some hope but not even her pretty girl next door looks and personna could not dig you out of this poop. This film could fertilize the state of California. Im being hard because im tired of all the bad horror films that have been put out as of late. ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" has been the only exception up to date. That film was fun, thrilling, and well made. So what if it didn't have a real plot...it still kept you entertained. This mess is another story. But I fear we will see a future installment just like the upcoming H2. The Halloween remake was just as bad and we are in for another one.

They already did Freddy vs Jason and I kind of like that movie but this movie makes about as much sense as why they made 20 Friday the 13th movies in the first place. Don't be intrigued by the trailer and ads saying ""from producer Michael Bay"" because its just to bring in a wider audience but if you have seen any Michael Bay films, the only thing this film has in common with those is horrible acting and boobs galore. I will admit this movie was not boring because I was laughing at many moments (most of them not intended to be funny of course) and seeing stupid drunk pot headed teenagers getting killed is always a plus.

280,evilresident097,A successful rehash of one of horror's ultimate icons.,5,8 December 2009,"Plot: On Friday, June 13, of 1980, Jason Voorhees supposedly drowned at Camp Crystal Lake. His mother Pamela(Nana Visitor) went insane and killed all but one of the camp counselors, who did her in with a machete. But Jason wasn't dead: his watched his mother die. Ever since, Jason(Derek Mears) has prowled the remains of the camp, killing anyone who dares cross his path. Meanwhile, Trent(Travis van Winkle), Jenna(Danielle Panabaker), and their friends head to Trent's house for beer, drugs and sex. Also thrown into the mix is Clay(Jared Padalecki), who's been searching for his sister who went missing in the area six weeks earlier. But they'll have to deal with the machete wielding hockey masked psycho that is Jason Voorhees.I don't care what the critics say. I enjoyed most of this movie overall. First is the new Jason. He's leaner, meaner, and a lot more athletic. In one scene we see Jason on the ground and mere seconds later, he's climbed the roof of a pretty big house. Another has running like a marathon man, a huge improvement of the slug from the 80's. I also give credit to Steve Jablonsky(Transformers 1&2, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre), who makes a wicked score for the film, mixing his work with that of Harry Manfredini, composer of the original Friday. But it has its faults. Take away the new Jason, and you get the basic hack 'n' slash that's been in 10 movies and a spin off. The acting is really average, but top performances go to Mears as Jason and Aaron Yoo as the Chewie, the comic relief who really knows how to play his part.*Note: I recommend the Killer Cut of this film. Not only does it run nearly 10 minutes longer, but it makes the film lightly more enjoyable.Overall, this is a better remake of the horror genre. But if they make a round 2, please don't let it go the way of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning. I give Friday the 13th a 7 out of 10.",Friday the 13th

The plot is just like any other Friday the 13th movie however Jason kind of gives off a Thomas Hewitt vibe from TCM 2003....but they don't mess with the formula and respect the source material, so I would definitely recommend it. I had fun watching it",Friday the 13th
282,TreasureHunterGirl,"Not too bad, but not too good either",6,20 May 2019,"This movie was okay. There were a few things in it that stepped outside of Jason Voorhees usual MO, such as his place of habitation, his methods of killing, his speed (I actually love that Jason never used to break into a run but could still catch his victims despite them running for dear life). These changes will have gotten a few people offside and at first I was even like ""Jason wouldn't do that! This is stupid!"" etc. But then I thought well why bother making a remake if you're not going to mix things up a bit? If you were just going to remake something exactly like the original then people may as well just watch the original. But then this isn't exactly a remake either, it's technically another sequel. But where exactly does it fit in? Is this what Jason did after Freddy vs Jason and before Jason X? Did Freddy teach Jason a thing or two after their showdown? Anyway, these factors make it hard to judge if it was any good or not. As a remake it was okay, as a sequel it wasn't so good.If I were to view this as a stand-alone film I think it was a good slasher movie. There's a lot more blood and gore compared to old slasher movies which would often cut away before showing anything. I guess this made it scarier though nothing I'd lose sleep over.The characters were pretty standard of this type of movie; bunch of teens with drugs, booze and sex on the mind. The characters of Whitney (Amanda Righetti) and Clay (Jared Padalecki) made it a little more interesting but nothing too brilliant there.The final showdown was a bit disappointing. The wood chipper was there begging to be used but wasn't utilised like it could've been. Was this because there was a distant hope of another Jason movie and explaining his rebirth after being shredded to tiny pieces would've been too hard? Was it because Jason X is set after these events and he's in one piece in that? Or was it sentimentally getting in the way of this iconic killer finally being bested by some of his victims? Who knows why the filmmakers pulled the final punch.The ending was a little stupid, but I get what they were trying to do. It was a poorly paid homage to the original and after all the changes they made I guess I was left wondering why they bothered.Definitely have mixed feelings about this one, but I like Jared Padalecki and Danielle Panabaker, so it was fun watching them battle it out with Jason.",Friday the 13th

In fact, I quite like a few of them, including Platinum Dunes' Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which I give credit for jump starting this remake craze to begin with. Also, it's not like the Friday the 13th series is known for being high art. After part 4, there wasn't another scary moment in the franchise ever again and coasted by with mindless tits and blood for another 15+ years.That said, this remake hits a new low in the franchise. The opening 20 minutes are fairly solid and even a little spooky. Had this been an isolated short film, I'd be singing its praises, too. Unfortunately, after this intro, we're introduced to a gaggle of the most annoying and unlikable characters to ever populate a slasher film (and that's REALLY saying something). While character development has never been a Friday film's biggest strength, they at least didn't usually go out of their way to give us character this aggressively bitchy. One has to wonder why they're all vacationing together when they seem to have no chemistry, nothing in common, and are downright hostile to each other.It doesn't help that our hero, Clay, is played by Jared Padelecki - an actor as wooden as he is handsome.One would think that the film would at least supply us with a fair share of inventive kills, but even those aren't anything to write home about.

We have no choice but to root for Jason and, I'm not sure about you, but I like horror movies where I feel bad for the people being stalked and killed.If the characters aren't absolute morons or jerks, they're boring. We have the lead, Clay, who keeps trying to find his sister, but that's his only major character trait and it's hard to connect with him. Even worse is his sister who spends the entire film cowering in fear and screaming as she's trapped in the killer's secret underground lair.Friday the 13th is yet another misguided attempt at remaking a classic film that forgets what made the original so compelling and watchable in the first place.",Friday the 13th

A good opportunity to make a quality product as well as a paycheck with many zeroes. Win-win.But what is God's name happened? This movie is absolutely *horrible*.People always say things like 'what do you expect from a Friday The 13th movie?' or 'it's just a horror flick'. Since when is that an acceptable excuse to produce garbage? When did categorizing your film in the horror genre automatically exonerate it from the responsibility of telling a logical story with actual characters, credible dialogue and perhaps even a little respect for the audience? I look upon this as a movie. Not a remake or sequel. Not a Friday The 13th movie or a horror movie. Just a *movie*, which is open to the same criticisms and evaluation as a comedy or thriller or period drama.The closest this film comes to a plot is a guy looking for his sister. Along for the ride are about two dozen nobodies who serve one single purpose - dying. The first group had the one girl who was significantly less-annoying as the rest, and another suffers quite a creative death, but that is all this section of the movie has to offer. It lasts 20-some odd minutes and then we get a title screen. Off to another set of nobodies.The second group, driving around in a massive Escalade, I wanted dead before I even saw who they were. And once I did see them, I wanted to kill them myself. Every one of them looked like they stepped out of a fashion shoot or some trendy teen magazine, had no personality other than complete asshole, and was only in the movie to get killed.The only likable character was the guy looking for his missing sister, who was with the first group of nobodies. The pretty brunette who takes a liking to him would have been alright if she didn't ditch her boyfriend to sneak off in the woods for 8 hours with the first tanned, muscle-bound hunk that knocked on the door.There are countless set-ups without pay-offs and several pointless scenes tossed in to stretch the running time, or perhaps to cover-up the fact that this movie has a tracing-paper-thin plot.The whole movie is almost literally just Jason killing people. I know that's what the filmmakers believe the audience wanted to see, but that is not true. That is the audience's *expectation*, because the films in the series are so incredibly poor.But why not take pride in your work and write something that isn't pathetically amateurish and actually work at making a good film? I'm not talking about this franchise, but EVERY horror film. It's such a popular genre that consistently churns out pointless garbage. But write a story with a plot, with characters that we might actually care about...and you'll make a fortune. It worked for The Sixth Sense.I would also like to point out that the title, Friday The 13th, played absolutely no role in this film and was not mentioned by any character one single time. They could have called it May 4th and nothing would have changed. Why not exploit the concept of that particular day within the story? I cannot believe how consistently bad horror films are these days.Note to Hollywood: WRITE SOMETHING GOOD AND YOU'LL MAKE EVEN MORE MONEY!!!",Friday the 13th
287,drh-8,Fun if you're of GWB intelligence,5,13 November 2009,"History (that is, movie history) tends to pre-colour one's thinking and so the original Friday the 13th movies must precondition viewers for what's to come in this, the latest offering for those with a propensity for bizarre murder stories.However, don't today's filmgoers deserve SOME credit for intelligence? Like, don't we expect supposedly young adults with (supposedly) some education to behave a bit logically? Given that there's a killer running amok in the neighborhood, wouldn't it be sensible to plan some sort of strategy to beat him? But no. Our protagonists split up and race around the woods with the women screaming a lot of the time and the guys displaying gross incompetence. Interesting too that those ear-drum shattering screams, which, on an otherwise peaceful country night, would be easily heard at least two miles away, don't seem to be heard by anyone when it's most crucial. Ho Hum!Then, when one of the group eventually puts in an emergency call to the police telling them that there's a mass killer slaying everyone in sight, the cops send ONE man! This is, in actual fact, in direct contrast to all those other American movies where the police send about two hundred armed swat-team members, several helicopters and umpteen squad cars all with sirens screaming to rescue a cat up a tree! Oh no! Not here! ONE cop - and a not too bright one at that! Then, as the climax approaches, with one of the protagonists at last armed with a gun, instead of using common sense and waiting for the killer to come into the line of fire and letting him have it with a single shot, our hero empties the magazine on closed doors and shadows and then goes racing out to his death at the hands of a far more calculating creature than himself or his companions.Nevertheless, if you like suspense with a bit of sexy action (not to mention some superb female bodies!!!) I guess you might get a little pleasure from the latest (but obviously not the final) Crystal Lake saga!",Friday the 13th
288,The-Evil-Dead,Perfect. Thank you Michael Bay.,9,13 February 2009,"Michael Bay kicks ass, I officially am a fan. This film was everything a Jason flick should be, and while it doesn't break any new ground at all... It doesn't need to. There hasn't been a fun slasher like this in awhile, and it's awesome to have Jason back.I wasn't let down in any way. The kills were all solid, they didn't try to do anything to mess with the character of Jason... Other than he can run now. Even though they try to make his presence more realistic within the movie, he still ends up right behind the stupid teens at every turn. The guy who played Jason was off the chain, he did a perfect job... Just as good as Kane Hodder ( Who did several Jason movies and sort of gave Jason the persona he has ). They let Jason get right to the point to, and rather brutally.The characters within the movie are your typical punk college kids and all they are is Jason's fodder. There's some attempt to put a story into this film, but it's pretty flat and really just strings everything together. But you're here for Jason, and his dirty work, right? It's a Friday the 13th flick, through and through, with a bit more polish. If you're a fan of Jason movies you'll eat this up, if you're someone who enjoys a good slasher or horror film every now and then, this should satisfy. There were several scenes that had the audience jumping, which was something I haven't seen while viewing a Jason flick in theaters. It seems that some of the chills are back in the series, and that's good. If you think horror movies suck, or think The Exorcist is the only good horror movie, pass.I loved the ending of the film, too. Classic Jason. I really can't wait for a sequel. I'm guessing the box office is going to be good enough for this film to warrant one.I'd give it like 15/10.",Friday the 13th

This is a great movie for what it is, which I did not expect. It has everything, and the cinematography is sleek. More creativity would have carried this to a 9/10. However, judged solely against other horror movie franchise remakes and additions, this is a 10/10 and, quite possibly, the best of them all.",Friday the 13th

291,austinkunkle,Once again an awesome Jason movie,10,18 November 2016,"Obviously these are the type of movies Micheal Bay would make,because he's obsessed with hot girls and with the way this movie went,he obviously proved it. Especially in the extended killer cut version. But other than Micheal Bay's addiction with girls,He did a pretty awesome job with Jason. Like he didn't treat him like transformers,he treated him like how Jason was suppose to look. And the best part is they added part 1,2,and 3 all in one movie. It's amazingly possible that I noticed that. I wonder if anyone who saw this noticed that. Anyway I'm glad Jason's not a robot;I mean they did something like that in Jason x,but he was in outer space ,so it would make sense to do something like that in a movie where he goes to outer space in a 300 year present time. But minus that point,I thought this Friday the 13th was the best. Sure it's just another Jason movie with nothing new,but it's his performance that excited me. In fact,I'm adding this to my number 1 list. I'm just really big on these types of horror characters;it's just so amazing.

293,ben_mister_s,Another successful remake!!!,8,13 February 2009,"This is how it should be done. Instead of going on with boring sequels, do a remake of the original. I'll be honest about it, Freddy versus Jason, Jason X, Jason goes to hell, Friday the 13th Part Billion etc, it was all fun to watch, but serious, does it get original over the years? No no no!!!I think they did an excellent job making this movie. It's also a good way of introducing people to the original series. Ever since this movie had trailers on TV, you can see the original movies for sale everywhere. This movie does to Friday the 13th (1980) what Batman Begins did for Batman. What's also great about this movie, is that they combine elements of the original movie and some of the earlier and better sequels. This movie has the mother of Jason and Jason instead of just the mother like the original. Also Jason has is face covered with a rag first like in part II and then finds a hockey mask to wear like in part IIIThe murders are nothing we have never saw before, but for a Friday The 13th movie, it's pretty good. It also has a couple of minor spoofs of the movies/murders previous to this Friday the 13th movie. In Part 7 and Jason X, Jason murders girls by smashing there sleeping bag with them inside against a tree. In this movie he gives a whole new meaning to the Jason hype sleeping bag murders. Also the famous bow and arrow are back in this movie, as well as nasty behind the door surprises. Also funny was seeing a wheelchair in Jason's lair, which reminded me of Friday the 13th part II, where mark was condemned to a wheelchair. These are just a couple of the many things that link you back to the entire series.A good old popcorn horror-movie containing everything! Annoying characters, bimbo's, dumb actions that lead to the inevitable consequences, enough naked girls and sex scenes, fun and gory murders, a couple of good shock moments and enough American Pie jokes. Oh yeah I forget a convincing Jason!!! How can Jason be convincing, some people will probably ask. Let's just say he is not the kind of Jason that can twist heads of victims like a cap of a bottle (Friday the 13th part 6) He is more 'human'.That's all for now, I watched it today (friday the 13th). I can only say, do the same!!!Good horror!!8 out of 10",Friday the 13th
294,baileygiannini,Jason Vorhees is back in this terrifying remake of Friday the 13th.,5,17 December 2010,"Anyone looking for a scary movie this is it. Friday the 13th is Terrifying but there's highs and lows. The highs are it has the serial killer Jason Voorhees in it. It takes place in camp Crystal lake and Jason has a classic style look. The lows are there's to much gore at some points, there's nudity, there's no reason to swear like crazy. I give it a 7 stars For the story but the content is 4 stars. It's just amazing how far we've come first it's Dracula way back in 1931 and no gore now in 2010 we're chopping people's heads off. Overall The film gets a 7 stars. The Guy Trent at one point got thrown into a sharper or whatever on the back of a truck after Jason stabbed him with gore coming out. And that was a truly pathetic scene on the movie. We need gore once in a while not through the entire thing. the Amityville Horror did it without and it was scary overall 7 stars.",Friday the 13th
295,derekprice1974,"Decent homage, but action moves too fast",6,12 February 2009,"To have remade this film, you would have thought the producers would have developed it a bit better. I do agree that the first 10-15 minutes were good and that it lulls for a bit. However, what I hate most is when during the chase/action scenes the camera moves all over the place. Why do they do that? NONE of the original Friday films did that, so why start now!? I think that the film could have been more, it had a lot to live up to, and some of the new plot elements (the hidden catacombs underneath the camp?) were a bit too much. I think this is the weakest of the remakes so far that Michael Bay has done. I did like that it started out showing the mother getting killed, which adds to it. But, something I don't like with these remakes is how they make them too ""slick."" In the original Fridays and Halloweens, the characters were everyday citizens who happen upon bad fortune. These cover models running the woods don't do it for me.",Friday the 13th
296,rawisnwo,A mixed bag,5,30 April 2019,"First off, I should state that I am a big fan of the series and was always hesitant to give this remake a go.Secondly, when I did watch it, I went in with an open mind and gave it a chance.These are the results, IMHO of course.The Good:1. Some of the kills are excellent. I don't want to go into details to spoil it but Jason is really being creative and imaginative in his kills.2. They review the first three Friday movies, more or less - cutting out some of the filler.3. The town knowing more or less to stay away from Jason's territory was a nice touch.4. Jason's intelligence in his environment and needs was cool to see. For example, him setting up traps and snares gives you an idea of how well he knows the land and to hunt.The Bad:1. The glossing over of the first Friday film. As great as Jason is, Mrs. Vorhees is just as popular among Friday fans.2. The characters. I didn't really care about any of the characters really as they all tended to be annoying in their own way. Mostly bad acting too. Also Kane Hodder's absence is apparent.3. Despite Jason being left alone, he does kill and attempt to kill a few town folk; this is inconsistent.4. Jason is a bit too sadistic and TCM type killer here. I get he is human but they could've had him be like F13 part II Jason.Overall there is a lot of success and failures evident in the film. Part of the problem is that F13 1-3 are some of the better ones and remaking all of them into a single movie has large shoes to fill.It makes you wonder if the studio will ever go back into the Tommy vs Friday saga anytime soon.",Friday the 13th
297,demonsquipster,keep expectations low,4,20 October 2019,"It's a sad and pathetic excuse of a remake, and it's doing nothing but slandering Jason Voorhees' name. aside from the kills (which is the only reason besides Jared Padalecki and Jason himself that I'm rating this so high), it's incredibly boring. I've seen this type of movie all before. ""horny teenagers go out into the middle of nowhere and get killed off, one-by-one."" you could make that interesting, if you tried. this movie does not try. (of course, it's not as though you can go into any Friday the 13th movie expecting anything other than gruesome deaths and big breasts.) this movie in particular, is never scary. it's never tense. it's never anything other than predictable. I love Jared Padalecki, but even he can't save this movie. most of the acting is flat, and isn't very convincing. the writing is dull, and the jokes are tasteless and unfunny. if you haven't seen it, I wouldn't bother. don't waste your time nor money on this.",Friday the 13th
298,kobrakommand,Another Useless Remake,2,1 September 2010,"Now they tried to throw in a lot of sex in this movie to match what was done in the previous movies, because Jason hated premarital sex, but it was just overdone.Now the beginning of the movie they introduce you into a bunch of kids, and then just have them all killed off, Just to get more one screen kills.The movie is terrible, it's nothing like a jason movie should be, I mean at one point Jason Kills someone with a bow and arrow. WHY THE HELL WOULD JASON KNOW HOW TO USE A BOW AND ARROW? YA YOU USE A BOW AND ARROW AT CAMP BACK IN THE 80's BUT IT'S JASON GIVE HIM THE MUTHER F'IN MACHETE! HIM BEING ABLE TO USE A BOW AND ARROW COMPLETELY JUST DESTROYS HIS CHARACTER, AND I MEAN THE MACHETE, HE'S ALWAYS USED THE MACHETE IT'S HIS WEAPON OF CHOICE HIS CALLING CARD... terrible I liked how it ended up brother and sister surviving at the end, instead of man and girlfriend, but it makes no difference.PURE GARBAGE There's a hatred for this film that I just cannot express. I mean character development, there is none and it seems like whenever someone comes on screen bam they die. what happened to the slow build ups and friends being there for each other and suspense. You'll find none of that stuff here. I mean one good scene where they are hiding from Jason when they finally make it to camp crystal lake.

302,MoronUnited,A Genuinely Awful Experience From Start to Finish,1,15 February 2009,"Michael Bay is essentially the Ed Wood of our modern era. He's a delusional, incompetent moron that can never seem to make anything worth watching or entertaining in the slightest. He butchered the classic Transformers, and his film rendition of Pearl Harbor was a worthless pile of trash. His latest project? A Dawson's Creek film adaptation..with a psychotic killer sub-story.The original Friday the 13th film was a genuinely creepy slasher flick that managed to achieve everything it set out to do. The idea of showing the slayings from the perspective of the killer while never showing who was behind them until the very end was a great concept, and the acting from the teen cast was actually believable and well done. Whether or not you like the literally 10 films that followed is irrelevant, since this new remake has decided to throw everything that the series has achieved thus far out the window, and deliver a 96 minute test in patience.First of all, it takes the movie 20 minutes to officially start. By the time the title had appeared on the screen, I had completely forgotten that it hadn't been shown before. This intro of sorts could have been condensed to about three minutes, but I guess an 80 minute movie was a bit too short for the theaters. Anyway, the rest of the movie is simply Jason Vorhees just killing everyone in sight, which further shows that Michael Bay hasn't even seen the original movie he was remaking, but at this point I don't even care anymore. It's also incredibly sad that a movie made in 1980 has better special effects than here in 2009. The killings are so poorly done, and the blood looks so fake that it's hard to even enjoy this crap on a campy level.For a slasher flick, it takes a lot to make constant murders feel redundant, but this movie takes redundancy to a whole new level. It takes finesse and real skill to make an hour and a half of blood and boobies boring as hell, but incredibly, it has been done. As far as the acting is considered, I think the only thing that could possibly make it worse was if Paul Walker had been in it. As it stands though, the god-awful acting coupled with some of the worst dialogue ever put in a motion picture only help to further pound in the nails in this film's coffin.Many of the biggest mistakes in this movie though, involve Jason Vorhees himself. To be incredibly blunt, he simply is not scary at all. His rugged appearance makes him look like an idiot, and if he came running at you with a sharp weapon, I think you would be too busy laughing to run away. Oh, that's another thing: Why the hell does Jason run now? Must we ruin everything that made the series what it is today? Remakes have the potential to be entertaining trips down memory lane, but with the Friday the 13th Remake, all we receive is a half-assed pile of vomit. The effects are awful, the acting is atrocious, and just hearing the classic musical cue made me cringe, seeing as how nothing else in the movie feels remotely like a Friday the 13th movie. Considering Michael Bay is also working on the A Nightmare on Elm Street remake that Robert Englund rightfully snubbed, I can't even imagine how he will ruin that franchise. In the end, while advertised as a series reboot, the Friday the 13th Remake is undeniably the worst in the series, and will go down in history as one of the worst movies ever made.*If you are looking for a great, new-age tribute to the slasher genre, check out Hatchet if you haven't seen it yet. Far better than this piece of trash.",Friday the 13th
303,diegoavilarodriguez,Jason returns... and not too bad at all,6,25 March 2009,"For so long I've been looking for a good and decent slasher flick, Hacthet was a disappointment and OK at the same time, saw was new twist, and Rob Zombie's Halloween wasn't that great(to me). When I heard Friday the 13th would have a remake I was hoping that I wouldn't be disappointed, and I wasn't. Being a Jason Voorhees fan, I really enjoyed this film. It did not change Jason's background or killing techniques in any way... of course in here they may be more sadistic, and that's a good thing. Though this was supposed to be a remake, it only included two things of the original films and that was Pamela Voorhees'(Jason's mom) decapitation scene and Jason wearing a pillow case or bag on his head, just as in part 2. The acting was typical of the usual Friday the 13th series, certain sexual-related jokes, some use of drugs, partially explicit sex scenes and the main character's possible relationship with a girl he just met. Jared was great and did his job well, the others were just as good. The kills are good and typical of Jason, machetes, arrows, axes and all of the other stuff that makes a Jason Voorhees so great and original, and like every Friday the 13th film, Jason will find his hockey mask at a certain point of the beginning of the film and wear through out the rest of it. In conclusion, I was not disappointed at all by this film, in fact I enjoyed it so much that I had to see it more than once, for those Jason fans out there you will enjoy this film without a doubt because it's more of a continuation than some remake that'll make you feel cheated of your time and for those who are new to the Friday the 13th series you will enjoy this film, and also expect and hope for a sequel to this film.",Friday the 13th
304,notaprincess9,"I predicted every scene, every move, every death & the ending..",3,17 November 2017,"I have not seen the ''original'' because I am pretty sure I would not like it because it is an older film and most of the times I don't feel the vibe others get from example films of the 90's and so on. So I am not actually going to compare those two, I just rated it on what I saw.Because of all the hype surrounding Jason Voorhees and Friday the 13th as a date, I decided to give the film a try and see what the fuss is all about.!!HUGE SPOILERS!!The story was promising: Jason is an extremely self-conscious about his disfigured face child who's only loved by his mother and drowns because no one kept an eye on him. So after his mother's death and his horrible childhood experience, he starts killing everyone that visits the camp and some other people living nearby. So far so good. But without exaggeration, I predicted almost all his moves, even how he would kill his victims. I predicted how the blonde would pull the curtain, how he would throw the ax at the black guy, how the police arriving wouldn't be more than one guy, how he would die at the door, how only the siblings would survive, how the girl would save her brother by distracting Jason, how he wouldn't have died and would show up from underwater (was literally screaming at the scene ''don't stand so close to the water''), how he would shoot the guy on the boat from afar and then the boat would hit the girl.......and so many other actions that I could literally have written the script, which made the film predictable and ultimately, boring.",Friday the 13th
305,hollywoodgirl-1,Jason!,7,15 February 2009,"I went into this movie not having seen a single Friday the 13th movie all the way through. I originally didn't want to see this one, not because it looked bad, quite the opposite: because I thought it looked genuinely scary. And I scare easily.As 2/13/09 drew closer and I began watching the trailer more and more I decided that I really did want to see it. Overall, I liked it. I couldn't help but compare it to My Bloody Valentine 3- D which I saw a little less than a month ago, and this was without a doubt a more technically sound movie. The storyline was better, the cast was better, the dialogue was better by a slight margin. That leads me into what I liked. Director Marcus Nispel gave the movie a great atmosphere; things were almost always tense or creepy. Jason was imposing and definitely quite frightening. The situation was believable for the main group of characters.Now for what I think hurt the movie. First of all, I am not a big fan of the decision to have two sets of characters. I understand it was necessary to introduce Whitney's predicament but I thought it really hurt the main group. The movie is only one hour and thirty-five minutes so the first set of characters drastically depletes the time we have to get to know the second set. We know them for less than a day before they all start getting picked off. I think Willa Ford's character had maybe five lines, the Nolan character less than that. I just really didn't care about the characters that much. The second thing I disliked was the backstory/captivity of Whitney. The Mrs. Voorhees part in the beginning felt jarring and tacked on and then I just felt that the Whitney in captivity part was preposterous and weird. Also, it is simply not feasible for Jason to appear everywhere completely unnoticed. He is a huge guy, there's no way you wouldn't see or hear him coming, yet he appears completely out of nowhere so many times. Jumpy? Yes. Plausible? Not at all. These elements combined unfortunately made the movie not scary. I jumped a lot during it but I was not scared afterward, not at all.I really did like the movie, for me the detractors were not so bad that I came out hating it. It was well-done in my opinion with effective jump scares and I liked the different take on the series. Now let's see if a sequel comes out in this same vein.",Friday the 13th
306,glen-88,Should be sunk in Crystal Lake,2,15 February 2009,"I'm sorry - anyone who states this brings back the good old days of the franchise - forgets one thing, the good old films at least, occasionally, had some new twists or original ideas in them.This film doesn't just make a nod to the old Fridays, it rips them off and rehashes their guts out. I felt like I was watching a highlights clip show on MTV of all the other Friday movies with some extra loud sounds thrown in.Not one iota of the film tried to do something different or original, the deaths were laughably predictable, and yes there are one or two cheap scares thrown in but for eight bucks a pop we should be getting terrified all the time.Of course the originals were not masterpieces either but at least they tried to develop the characters - this one has us meeting people we could care less about, and as satisfying as it is to see shallow model types get bludgeoned - it would have been much more terrifying if we actually liked or believed any of their motivations.Yes Motivation! Any idiot who says motivation for victim or monster is not needed has no concept of what makes a good story or a good scare.The Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw, even Halloween revamps were put together much better than this p.o.s. because they had some realistic aspect in their story, some motivation that worked on some level, and characters that we could identify with in some way.I give this dud 2 stars for the curves of some of the actresses but thats all.",Friday the 13th

Casting was well done. All the cast in the open sequence that the classic horror trope to a T, but a big enough horror fan can tell it's done that way ironically. Jared Padalecki was a stellar choice from his work in House of Wax remake and Supernatural. This was sort of Aaron Yoo's break out roll, and he started the show with his comedic one-liners, which don't ever become annoying; we should see him in more prominent standout rolls in the future. Derek Mears goes down as a legendary monster actor. Some of the kills are brutal, and the script has some moments good it really shines, outside of the blood and gore.
That doesn't go as far as to say some classic Friday fans may not like how Jason is portrayed. Overall, this movie is enjoyable to watch and and breathes new life into Jason's cult status.",Friday the 13th
308,party pat,Not as bad as I thought it was going to be,8,26 September 2009,"Im not a fan of remakes at all but this one was one of the better ones I have scene. For what ever that is worth. There were a few things I didn't like about it though. Whats up with Jason having a home. He comes back from the dead and kills until someone kills him. Why would he bother having a residence, its not like he goes home after a long day of killing to relax. He just keeps killing. Also he doesn't take prisoners, he kills everyone. I don't care if she looks like his mom, he kills everyone. A lastly, when did he start cleaning up the kills. He usually hides the bodies from their friends, but he does go and clean up the entire crime scene. That aside I did like the movie. The kills were pretty awesome and they just kept coming. The movie also follows the standard pattern from the original movies. I wish the would not have said this was a remake, they should have just made it another movie in the series. Definitely worth the watch for fans of the series and 80s horror movie fans.",Friday the 13th
309,paul-kristensen,A bunch of kids are stalked by a psycho killer,8,18 November 2010,"at the start of a film we see a young woman running in a rainy, wet, dark and stormy night by an unknown assailant. The assailant is later known to be Pamela Voorhees. She's ranting and raving to this woman about the death of her son. Mrs. Voorhees blames her for the death of her son. In an act of self defense the young woman beheads Mrs. Voorhees. As the young councilor runs off, a young boy approaches the now slain Mrs. Voorhees she tells this boy (who's later known as her son) to seek vengeance for both of there wrong-doings. Then it fast forwards to the present and we see a group of young campers who come to this clearing and decide to camp. Two of the campers (Whitney and Wade) go off to explore and they come along an old worn down ""Camp Crystal Lake"" so they explore. They happen to come upon now grown Jason Voorhees. Wade is killed and Whitney tries to run back to camp to warn the other but he follows her and slays them all. As he is about to slay her it cuts and jumps to another seen. Then another group of teens go for some summer fun at their friends' house. Slowly one by one they're stalked(some murdered). So who'll survive the night? Who'll defeat this legendary foe? To find out who survives this deadly day watch Friday the 13th.I really do enjoy horror films and I like that this was remade with today's technology. But the one thing that was very inappropriate was the use of graphic sexuality and nudity. Personally I think that these elements are unneeded. Out of ten I would give this film a eight and a half.",Friday the 13th
310,namideo,Better than I expected!,6,13 February 2009,"I'm not sure how many people were even anticipating this movie in the first place. The only reason I'm writing this review is simply because I'm a big F-13 fan! As bad as they are, it's always been a guilty pleasure. This isn't a movie people are going to be shoving each other aside to see. It's not The Dark Knight. BUT, I would say that it is The Dark Knight of the Friday the 13th series, so to speak.These movies have a reputation for being really, really tame. Sometimes, even downright comical, especially if you saw the last installment where Jason goes to outer space in the future. Shuddddderrrrr (Jason X - HORRIBLE movie - don't ever see it). So, naturally I was surprised when this movie freaked the hell out of me! Not only are the scares there, but for a movie of this genre, I was surprised overall how well it was done. It's not Oscar worthy by any means, but for a F-13 movie, the acting, writing, directing, everything, has taken a tremendous leap forward, from being a rather laughable film series to actually earning some credibility in the genre. I couldn't believe a typical slasher movie played with my expectations. Not to say that some of it wasn't predictable, but that too was part of the fun. The death scenes are frightening. The sex scenes are what they are. The stupid jokes actually made me laugh. The chase scenes are exciting! And the characters were likable enough for me to feel sad when they got ""slashed."" I really wanted some of them to make it, because they actually earned my interest.This being another reboot, along the lines of Batman Begins, Casino Royale, etc. there were plenty of throwbacks to the original films. Well, the first 4 movies, to be specific, but I won't bore you with a history lesson on a B grade slasher series. The attention to detail is amazing, and the writers/director did their homework. It's great when you feel your fandom is being respected. It's probably safe to say the filmmakers were fans of the series as well. What I loved is how they incorporated those elements from the early days of 80s horror, but didn't follow the formula so strictly as to leave the film void of plot twists and surprises. The movie Scream gives you a perfect outline of such a formula, and what's great about this film is the way they bend and tamper with it. One of which is the way they humanized Jason. I think what made him truly scary this time around wasn't just the fact that he's roughly 7 feet tall (EEK!), but the fact that he was a man, with a past, a life (as bizarre and messed up as it is) and methods to his madness (literally). He really is, in my opinion, one the greatest monsters to ever grace the screen.Although, it's a difficult movie to recommend, as only a pretty limited audience would get much enjoyment out of it. If you're a fan of the series or the genre, then don't hesitate! If you're into creepy, gory, epic stuff, then by all means go see it. If you're squeamish and downright don't like horror movies, then stay clear of this movie! But perhaps the best aspect of seeing this movie was seeing it on the big screen with an audience. This was the first F-13 movie I wasn't introduced to by T.V. or blockbuster. In the end, these movies are meant to be fun, and it's great to have a movie going experience that you can both get scared and laugh at with you friends. Hell, I didn't know hardly any of the other audience members. There's just something about jumping, laughing, and cracking jokes whilst watching an epic movie. I've heard people who grew up in the 80s talk about his experience while watching horror movies like Friday the 13th, but I never experienced it for myself. And I had a blast! Is it a great movie? No, not really. But it's fun, if you're into that sort of thing. In any case, I'll probably check the closet or peek behind the shower curtain before I sleep tonight!",Friday the 13th
311,Soucriant,This is Jason Modernised; Deal with It.,6,14 February 2009,"As I was sitting watching Friday the 13th, I could tell almost straightaway that there would be a significant amount of people who would loathe this movie. If you hated Marcus Nispel's re-imagining of The Texas Chainsaw, it's likely you'll feel the same way about this. I, for one, thought it was a great film. And for the record; I adore the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. The reason why I think both films work so well, is because of one thing: Separatation. The TCM remake is based on the premise of the original film, but that's where it ends. Yes, it has a group of young people in a van driving through Texas. Yes, there is also Leatherface and his family, who are hunting these kids down. But, to me, the remake takes place in a different world to the original. Not just in the obvious sense that it was made in 2003, and updated. (Although, I thought the 70's vibe was captured very well.) But, I look at both films, and I really don't see very many similarities, aside from the obvious basic idea and characters. Isn't that the best kind of re-imagining? I'll certainly take something that brings new ideas and characters to the table, than a bland, shot-for-shot remake.So, what then is so polarising about Friday the 13th, already? I'll be the first one to admit this isn't a spectacular movie. The script is pretty weak, the acting is very questionable in parts, but it kept my attention throughout. It has a sense of humour, the opening sequence is a blast, the kills are neat, there's a few different elements, and, most importantly...Jason. He's faster, more creative and more intelligent. I honestly don't see how a fan of the series couldn't love what they've done with Jason here. I think Marcus Nispel has made him fearsome again.What I honestly think is that a lot of fans can't deal with both a modernised Friday the 13th and Jason Voorhees. I think people are being very harsh on this. Let's be honest, here. Just how much originality can you inject into a Friday the 13th flick? This is a ten film series, that has successfully run on a very simple premise. Everyone knows the set-up. The only two films that truly took a risk and stepped outside of F13's comfort zone, are Jason Goes to Hell and Jason X; The latter being one of the most hated of the series. I, myself, thought it had A LOT of guts and was very good fun. Some fans are being too stubborn, here. People want a reboot, yet they aren't prepared to move along with the times and work with it. People whined and trashed Jason X because it took our villain out of Crystal Lake. What, then, do these people want? It's Friday the 13th. You don't watch it to see a gripping, emotional storyline. Nobody watches a F13 movie expecting to be challenged or moved. We all watch it to see Jason doing what he does best. And Jason will always sell; this just isn't 80's Jason, anymore. He's moved on, and so has the series. I guess some people just aren't ready to move with them.",Friday the 13th
312,marccfantozzi,Slick and stylish but a really bad film.,3,8 November 2021,"This film is awful. Too much sex and nudity and the acting is atrocious. Amanda Righetti is an awful final girl. I wanted Jason to kill all of these hideous characters. The score is not memorable like the other, older films in the franchise and the film introduces new plot elements that just don't work. This is a remake of the first 4 'Friday' films and it is such a let down and missed opportunity. The filmmakers could have made an amazing film but instead they gave us this. This ""reboot"" makes ""Jason Goes To Hell"" look like a masterpiece. Really disappointed.",Friday the 13th

After Jason X, the worst Friday movie in the franchise, I thought that the series was finally dead. Friday the 13th combines the original series part 1, 2,and 3 together. The result: A much slicker, scarier version of the original 3. The only problem with this film was its ending. The filmmakers had no idea how to finish the film with one last scare and produced an unoriginal sloppy ending to a well balanced film. This is one of those films where, as a filmmaker, I told myself this is how I would have done the ending. Take someone who gets scared really easy. I took my wife and the movie is ten times better. She scared me!",Friday the 13th

The whole thought behind being stranded in the woods always creeps me out, personally, so it did attract my attention somewhat. the story made total sense however, with the whole - this is why Jason is the person he is. it was nice being able to watch one of the what? thirty Friday the 13ths and not feel like i had no idea what was going on. it was an okay movie, the acting was well, pretty much nudity, some jumpy parts, a lot of crude humor and some story line. 4 our of 10.",Friday the 13th

Here we have a back story that lasts maybe 3mins, then it's - Welcome to Friday The 13th part 47 or whatever. Same old stuff, different day.No surprises, no twist, no story, no nothing, just Jason chopping people up.And the Hollywood happy stuff, god damn that's got to stop! I don't wanna give anything away in case you want to watch this piece of crap movie, but good lord why? And 6 weeks before he noticed the locket! The film writer is a moron! I say the film writer, because Jason can't be a moron, it's gotta take skill and mental agility for a bloke to efficiently use bows, machete's, throwing axes, be able to leap on buildings in a split second and come back from the dead.If you want to watch brain numbingly boring horror that you've seen a million times then this for you.0/10",Friday the 13th
318,dancer-91,pretty good,7,26 July 2009,"A lot of people bashed this movie, but I thought it was pretty good, when you consider that it wasn't meant to be an Oscar nominee.so the basic storyline is that two groups of kids enter the woods of Crystal Lake and get slaughtered by Jason, who once drowned in the lake and is now revenging what happened to him and his mother, who was beheaded in the original Friday the 13th. if you want a more specific one, then: group A kids go in the woods. start dying. group B enters the woods and start to die. and then there's Clay Miller who's looking for her sister, who was a part of group A kidsthis isn't a remake, it's not supposed to be Friday the 13th (1980) all over again, why do that when you have a perfectly good one already? it's more of a re-boost, more like ""this is what it could also be"" the character of Jason has gotten a new style. instead of being this supernatural freak who appears out of nowhere, he's more realistic and even smart. and he runs, which apparently made a lot for people mad. again, it's not a remake, it's not supposed to show the same Jason that you've seen for 11 movies now. and despite its name, it's not following the first Friday story, it's more like film 2 and 3. but his mother is shown in a really cool flashback. and this one has Jason with the hood-whatever and the hockey mask, but the scene is a little out of place, like ""we just had to put something here where he gets the mask""the acting isn't great, there's no character development, there's a lot of nasty kills and a lot of sex and nudity. and that's what I was expecting. I wasn't expecting to see a lot of depth in the characters, because they die anyway. and that's not even a spoiler. everyone who wants to watch this movie, wants to see pretty annoying people get slaughtered by this freaky killer after they have sex. so I think this movie did a great job doing that. it's a slasher after all. slasher are all about sex, nudity and gore. and that's the way it should be. but maybe there's was a few seconds too much bare breasts...all in all, I liked it, it provided some clever kills and scared the crap out of me.

A bunch'o idiots go into Camp Lake forest and get butchered... about seven people are killed before the title screen comes up. That's the highlight of the movie. Ummm... a couple mating is murdered right in their hot moment... ummm... I like the Water Boating scene... ummm...Characters:All of the characters are idiots. Either they're druggies, sluts, dickheads, wimps, jackasses, or fuckwads. The total jerk of the film (I already forgot his name) is, for some reason, the one who gets the hot girl ass, not any of the people who are smart and do what it takes to survive. Well, lucky for us, he does get what he deserves in the end.All of the characters are stereotypes. There's the heroic teenage girl who's going to save the day and save herself. There's the slut who's there for a sex scene. There's the jerk and the other throw-away characters simply there for death scenes (Which they aren't bad, by the way).And of course, there's Jason Vorhees.

The only problem is, it doesn't come out and say that. Movies like Grindhouse (Death Proof and Planet Terror) are aware they're making shitty movies on purpose. This is a movie with the name Friday THE 13th. And it's a cheap movie with terrible characters, no plot, sub-pair visuals, unrecognizable music, and no rewatchability.

There were very few memorable qualities when it came to this movie. It's not bad, but it didn't move the story forward or redirect it in a refreshing way. It plays off the original with the sex and violence, but once a kill happens it immediately turns to another scene rather then develop in the filth of the murder. I want more story and I want to understand the new Jason more. You won't find it in this movie though. Plus, he chose the hockey mask just because after killing someone, he found it in the same room? How about a more momentous moment? Seeing Julianna Guill's sex scene is worth 6 stars in itself (or just find the ""edited-together"" scene online (metacafe anyone?)). Kudos.",Friday the 13th
321,Chiyonosake23,Best horror remake by far,5,22 November 2011,"Best, and most faithful horror remake so far. And by this I only mean the remake's of the ""classics"", which ones I saw: Dawn of the dead (it was OK, but nothing really interesting or new compared to the original), Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which felt almost like a parody, a cheap movie with every cliché in the book, and tons of annoying jump scares), Nightmare on Elm street (which is by far the worst, managed to almost completely ruin Freddy), and Rob Zombie's retarded Halloween...Oh my.....Michael Myers, the unstoppable silent killer is nothing more than a messed up emo kid, who eventually shouts: DIE!!!???? What the......).After watching all those other remakes, I lost all hope. I didn't even check out this one until now. I was expecting nothing, and I ended up with a very pleasant surprise.This one felt they were putting actual effort into it. It felt it had at least a bit originality, or at least tried to bring something new to the table.For example the opening scene was interesting, it was nice to see the conversation between Mrs. Voorhees and the girl she tried to kill. It was short but suspenseful and believable, I think in real life this conversation would be pretty much the same. And it went surprisingly fluently. And gave a slightly different backstory to Jason, since this time he actually saw his mother's decapitation instead of just jumping out of the lake in the end. The original worked on a different level. It gave us a supernatural and shocking twist in the most unexpected moment, at the end of a movie, in which nothing supernatural happened before. this worked, because I was guessing eagerly: Is Jason a ""zombie"" this time, or not? He felt more vulnerable this time, which was a welcomed change, because in the latest movies it was certain he is unstoppable zombie anyway, and everybody will die. Here I had thoughts that they might have a chance against him.The next somewhat original thing was, that they tried to introduce the first set of characters, as the main characters, and they built them up, they actually developed them a little, and had a little fun with them, before they killed them off. Just when I started to know them, and feel we will stuck with them, they died. Its an old horror movie trick, most recently the first Scream did this, when they built up Drew Barrymore as the star of the movie, then killed her off after a little chit-chat. But it was something new to THIS franchise.And I saved the biggest reason I liked this movie for the last: It had LIKABLE characters. Yeah we had the typical douche character, the typical air-headed, easy going girl, they were the least developed, but the rest of the cast had at least some sympathetic moment. The ""black guy""-stereotype character was really funny, and even a little bit self-ironic this time, not just plain annoying or ""in-your-face"". The ""asian-guy"" stereotype was a likable loser and his scene in the tool-shed was really funny, with a few good lines (for example: this is your tool-shed? more poor people would call this a house....I liked this one), and the girlfriend of the douche was helpful and nice. And the guy who was looking for his sister, and the sister both were really also very interesting characters, I could really cheer for them. Most of the horror films today use only one-note, annoying characters, who you don't care for. Thus you feel no suspense. This time when Jason chased the remaining three sympathetic characters I found myself actually involved. I was interested what will happen, something I did not feel watching all the other above mentioned remakes. Only the ending was lame, but it was REALLY, really lame.... But overall this was a well-worthy addition to the Friday 13th franchise and didn't just feel that the makers wanted quick bucks with zero effort. They actually cared enough to make Jason ""cool"" again, at least for me.",Friday the 13th

323,jeremyfredrikson,"Hot chicks, but this retread really just runs thru the expected paces.",4,14 February 2009,"Okay, here's a review by someone who's not going to love every Friday The 13th movie just because it's a Friday The 13th movie. Some people are really obsessed with these films and will like them no matter what. And that's fine. In fact, that's good for them, because this one sure treads steady, familiar waters. The rest of us who want a genuinely scary horror movie and were hoping for some new plot elements, will more than likely be asking ourselves what was the point of making this film? It's definitely nothing new or original (unless you think a different weapon or killing method is enough to be called new and original, because the plot sure isn't). It's a recycling. Here it is in a nutshell. The film opens in 1980 with quick snippets of Jason's mother yelling at a girl, lumping her in with the counselors who let Jason drown on their watch. If you haven't seen earlier entries or read about the other films, you may not know what's going on, and even if you have you still might ask yourself what a young Jason is doing lurking around in the background during this opening scene. So did he drown or didn't he? Just when you start to ask yourself what's going on, the film cuts to the present day and a bunch of horny, annoying, beer and/or pot loving guys and gals on their way to find weed in the woods. Jason pops up and quickly eliminates these cartoony kids. This first 20 minutes is pretty fast once Jason appears, not good, just fast. Even Jason himself is fast, unfortunately. He's actually more like Leatherface here than the Jason we grew up to love. After he slaughters the teens in various ways (some predictably so, some freshly done, and one not even shown!), the title pops up which may invoke laughter since it comes so far in. Next...more dumb teens, but at least some in this next group improvise funny little lines here and there. The pacing is really off on this flick. It's fast, slow, fast, fast, sloooow, fast, fast, seen it before, dumb, done. There are scenes of talking which drag, and then Jason just popping up out of the blue to kill. No suspenseful build ups, just whammo! Stalker type scares? Forget about it. It's as if the filmmakers think the audience knows what's going to happen anyway so they skip the sweating, waiting, false-start moments that in earlier entries were the reasons behind any feelings of fear and shock. Some of the killings here invoke ""ewww"" responses, others have been done better before (in Silent Night, Deadly Night, earlier Friday entries, and even a kung fu flick called Warriors Two!). The goings on are so familiar that the entire effort comes across as really unnecessary. The main change is a very bad one, too. Jason's fast! Possibly for today's text messaging ""I need it now"" teen crowd? A fast Jason? Might as well make Aquaman a land lubber. Why not show the dumb teens at least trying to fight back before failing? Some different ideas are started but not carried through (ex. Jason has a nifty alarm system that tips him off that people are on his property, but he doesn't even go see who's there...although that was in See No Evil). Some dialog feels purposely corny and forced, other bits are genuinely funny and come off as possible improv, while some is just meaningless filler. The Good: great looking girls (especially one who has a prolonged sex scene and is the object of very funny dialog like, ""Your #@#s are so juicy, dude."" Dude!), some funny improv ""yeah, fix the chair cuz my dad used to beat me in it"", great looking girls, some unexpectedly timed kills and sounds (arrow, dog), great looking girls, a guy licking a centerfold magazine (the best part of the whole movie next to the extended sex scene), and did I mention great looking girls? The Bad: same old story, a fast and even thinking man Jason (we want our walk-and-kill Jason Voorhees back!), contrived bits (a completely forced and ridiculous homage to the original film's ending happens about 10 lousy seconds after the ""heroes"" dump a dead(?) Jason into Crystal Lake...not scary at all this time, just a joke laughed at by most in the theater), a real lack of suspense and build up, scenes that aren't filmed quite right (a camper's looking down at pot plants, next has gotta be a shot of Jason's shoes and a slow camera tilt up to him, right? wrong, just more pot plants and then a wide shot cut to a standing Jason...ho hum), and no legitimate, real scares (although the gore might gross some people out...and that dog bark!). A horror movie should be scary at least somewhere for Pete's sake unless it's a spoof. Sitting through this was like watching a rerun of a rerun where you almost always know what to expect. Except that instead of the victims walking...then listening...then walking...then stopping...oh, just a false start...then BOO!, this one's sped up to just talking then BOO, BOO, talking, BOO, etc. Fine effects, boobies, and some silly improv sure, but this one's really just more of the same. At least Jason X, Freddy VS Jason, Jason Goes To Hell, Part V, and the original tried to shake things up a little (which I guess is why die-hard Jason fans rank some of those lower on the scale, I guess). This one's really for those just wanting an assembly line product of what they've seen and liked in the past. I'd give it a 9 for boobies, a 2 for story originality, a 2 for genuine scares, an 8 for the well done but less than inspired gore effects, and an overall 4-5 as a passable entry that really just goes through the expected paces. Die-hard Friday fans rejoice! Horror fans, eh. It's got some moments...and boobies!",Friday the 13th

With the 2009 remake there is not one character who is written with even the slightest bit of care....possibly the most bland bunch of ""victims"" I've ever seen which thereby cuts all tension from the film as you want these kids to die...Unlikeable characters is the downfall of this film.PlotThe film begins actually kinda promisingly, a group of gorgeous 20-somethings are looking for weed and a place to camp (all very Friday the 13th, plot wise). They talk about jason by the fire, a couple of them have sex...and then the killing starts and all of them bar one are killed. Now the problem with this opening is that although it was intense it was in a way pointless and means that we now have 20 minutes less time with the group that is about to become our leads.And now we are introduced to our new cast of gorgeous 20-somethings...perhaps the most cliché cast of all time: we have our token Black and Asian guys, our two blonde sluts, a douche bag and his girlfriend we are meant to care about....and some other guy who i really just cant remember....along with that group we have the lone Clay (Jared Padalecki) who is riding around looking for his sister (the lone one who didn't die from the first group).CharactersSo there we have our characters and let me tell you there is SO little character development its actually hard to believe we are meant to even care what happens to these people. I get that most of them are just there to die...but come on! how can you have any suspense when dealing with such unlikeable characters. Our main characters are: Clay-Our boring male lead who is searching for his sister Jenna-Douche bag's girlfriend who makes the most stupid decision I've seen a character make in a long time....yes just go off into the woods with that dude you have only spoke to once. Whitney-Clays sister who spends the whole film screaming.. In the end the only character they get right is the douche bag...he is a douche bag.ActingI actually don't mind Padalecki (clay) as an actor but here he fails to bring any likeabilty to clay, granted he is working with a horribly bland character so i cant be too harsh. Danielle Panabaker is dull as hell as Jenna... Amanda Righetti is the most annoying of all of them, her screams are way to OVER THE TOP and every one she does sounds the same...terribly annoying actress Everything else The score is generic and dull... The lighting is much to dark making it hard to see whats going on The script is horrible and cheesy ""your tits are stupendous"" and ""say hi to mommy...IN HELL""All in all the film is pretty bad...maybe if the characters were more likable it would have been better....point is you cant enjoy a horror film if you don't care what happens to a least one of the characters.The only character they get right is the douche bag",Friday the 13th
325,Benderbeast,Everything I had hoped it would be,6,15 February 2009,"There's been a lot of classic horror movies that have been remade recently. Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of The Dead etc. and for the most part, they suck. The directors often ignore the original material and try to go in a new direction which ends up being terrible. So when I heard that one of my favorite movies of all time was being remade, I was angry to say the least, but like the fan boy I am, I grew more and more eager to see it as the release came closer.So for the people who don't know already, this is not a direct remake of the first Friday the 13h, Jason's mother is not the killer. It is more a remake of parts 2, 3, and 4 put into one movie. The movie centers around a group of teens who go to a cabin in camp crystal lake for the weekend. Meanwhile a guy named clay is desperately searching for his sister who went missing in the woods over a month ago. Needless to say, Jason is not to happy about any of this and begins doing what he does best; slaughtering everyone in sight.Now I really really enjoyed this movie. I thought it was Friday the 13th at its very best. One of my favorite things about this movie are that you can tell the director made this movie with the fan base in mind. He was very true to the original material, as well as adding some of his own stuff which ended up working very well. The movie was also very well paced, just when you start to get bored of watching the teens explore the cabin, get drunk. and have sex, Jason shows up and the carnage begins. Speaking of carnage, the kills were awesome. Some of them had me cringing, while others had me laughing out loud. Another great thing about this movie was Jason himself. Old zombie Jason who stalks his prey until they trip over their own feet has been thrown out and replaced with a faster, stronger, overall more badass Jason. He was even shown actually setting up traps for his prey and using other people as bait. I only had two real problems with this movie. One was the ending, it felt like a bit of a cop out. I'm not going to spoil it, but I would have preferred a little more closure. It was one of those endings that almost seems like the filmmakers ran out of ideas and just decided to end the movie. It wasn't a horrible ending, but I would have preferred something a little better. My second problem was the fact that the story was somewhat weak. Some of the characters were really hollow and just seemed like corpses waiting to happen. I wish they had taken a little more time to develop the characters.Overall I thoroughly enjoyed it and I think any Friday the 13th fan will enjoy it too. It is definitely one of my top 3 favorite Friday the 13ths of all time.A solid 8/10",Friday the 13th

327,skeletonman13,"""It's Gotta Death Curse!!!""",7,13 February 2009,"They should've listened to Crazy Ralf 30 years ago....I didn't grow up watching the series, but I bought the box set when it came out and watched the whole series, I saw the New Line Series as well. I am in love with Friday the 13th. And seriously, every day of this month, I watched one F13th film leading up to this remake/reboot.And now, on to the movie.Friday the 13th is the thrill ride we've been waiting for. It has it all. Gore, Tits, Drugs, and most importantly...Jason! The film starts off with a fast-paced 10-15 minutes. Some creepy guy killing of 5 horny teenagers looking to harvest some weed. And who is this creepy old guy that wears a sack over his head? Jason!! And boy, Jason is back, in a big way! Then we are introduced to Clay, searching for his sister who has been missing for 6 weeks, who was part of the group that Jason killed off in the first 10-15 minutes...only with one survivor. A group of teenagers is staying at a Cabin in the woods...sound familiar? And Jason decides to drop by...and all hell breaks loose.Friday the 13th '09 was worth the wait, it is a fast-paced roller coaster that gives us what we want. The deaths are freakin sweet, and trust me, there is a lot of the red stuff. Jason is a badass in this one. He kills with anything he can get his hands on to.Seriously, Die hard fan or causal horror fan...this is a must see not matter what. Trust me, this one really delivers. 10 stars!",Friday the 13th
328,rusties,A so so remake of Friday the 13th Part 2,5,20 February 2009,"This wasn't a terrible movie and certainly beats any of the other recent Jason sagas to come out but when compared to the original it so clearly follows (part 2 by the way, not the first one) it's clear that it doesn't fill all the elements that made part 2 the way it was. I'd like to start off by saying that Friday the 13th Part 2 is on of the greatest horror films ever made not because of the story. The story is predictable and slow. But because of the editing and directing where everything had the perfect timing to make the bravest person jump out of their seats constantly. Jason himself in that movie still goes down as one of the scariest looking villains in a horror film. The acting wasn't overacted and the makers of Part 2 created one of the most perfect horror films ever made.This film tries to recreate the story but falls flat on the timing and acting to really be convincing and as scary as the original. It isn't a terrible film and is pretty amusing at times. The acting was well acted and so I lay the blame on the director of this film who made it predictable and slow. Jason himself just didn't carry that scary persona like he did in the original Friday the 13th and Part 2 and as a result the film itself just wasn't that fun to watch. Perhaps a film like this is just to impossible to remake without losing the beauty behind the first Jason films.Even still, to be fair, compared to most horror movies released today this movie is a blessing. Using semi-well known horror actors with some talent such as Padalecki and Pababaker instead of casting well known actors that don't fit the part separate this film from just about any other horror film made since Saw. With the exception of Jason (who was about as scary looking as my grandmother) the art direction, scene, and costuming helped play an important role in helping this film succeed. Overall, perhaps not quite a film that all should see in theaters but at the very least a film true Jason fans should check out when it's released to the small screen.",Friday the 13th
329,sidekicknick43,Jason!!!!,8,30 March 2009,"Man, I loved the living hell out of this movie. Blood, women, a few jumps. And, there's not all that many jump scares. Please make more.Jason doesn't disappoint at all. He's scary for the first time in a while. Hollywood, keep with the smart, fast Jason. Now, a lot of people are complaining that this doesn't do anything new. Give me a break. Neither did any of the other ones. Granted, that's not a good thing per say, but I still don't hear anyone talking about that. I got laughs, booty, everything I wanted. Even the acting wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Even if it had been as bad as I thought, has this franchise ever been known for A grade actors. The only notable one I know is Kevin Bacon.All in all, this is a great movie. Although, I would advise the next film to try something new",Friday the 13th
330,jmayer2009,"Not amazing, not bad, but OK!!!",7,22 April 2009,I was really excited when i found out their was going to be a remake. I was supposed to see it on opening day but it turned out i couldn't. So i waited and waited for a chance to see it. Finally i was able to. When the movie ended i was disappointed. I was expecting way more from it. The movie would of worked better if they used the characters from the first 20 minutes for the whole movie and had them camping and then have Jason get them.I liked those characters more. The first 20 min was more like a Jason movie than the last hour of it. So the movie wasn't bad or amazing it just could of been better than it was. By the way the new actor playing Jason was perfect.,Friday the 13th
331,obsessedmovies,Fun and Entertaining.,9,7 April 2010,"The Friday the 13th reboot is about a man named Clay Miller going up to find his missing sister Whitney at the remains of Camp Crystal Lake. Along the way he comes across a group of friends who head up to their friend Trent's summer cabin. With the help of Jenna, Clay searches Camp Crystal Lake for his sister, and comes across the legendary Jason Voorhees. It stars Jared Padalecki who is also the star of my favorite show Supernatural as Sam Winchester. It co stars Danielle Panabaker, Amanda Righetti, Travis Van Winkle, Derek Mears, and Aaron Yoo. This movie has everything a Friday the 13th movie should have. Party going teens, Jason Voorhees, and tons of blood. It was an extremely fresh re-entry in one of my favorite movie franchises. My only two problems were that the writing could have been better, and some of the sex and nudity could have been reduced. Overall Friday the 13th 2009 was a fresh reboot and Friday the 13th fans should enjoy this movie.8.5/10",Friday the 13th
332,danhollow,So Predictable it's Fun!,5,7 June 2011,"Truth be told, I haven't seen the whole movie. But from what I've seen of it, it is definitely a fun experience for people who can handle blood, gore, and some of the most brilliantly transparent writing ever put onto film. Here come the spoilers; idiotic teens go to a deserted camp site to drink and get naked. Jason Voorhees kills them all. Not much of a spoiler, is it? The fun part about this movie is how easily we can see what's coming next. Think of those scenes you see in movies that you've already seen 100 times in other movies, but done better. After a while, you know what will happen. This movie takes it to the next step. You can predict whose going to die and exactly how they're going to die long before it even happens. The girl behind the other boy and girl who starts backing away while they're talking. Camera switch to her, Jason grabs her and murders her. Token black guy sees carnage, and runs the other way, looking back the whole time, completely oblivious to what's in front of him. Dead in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1... Someone hears a sound and goes to investigate with a flashlight in the dark. Never even see them die. There are literally about a dozen or more characters in here; and they're all going to die! They are all the perfect victims of any horror movie! The hardest part of the movie is finding a character with enough development to survive their first (and last) bad move. As I said, it's so transparent it's fun. A great movie to watch with friends at a party when you all want to yell ""cue Jason with machete in 3, 2, 1...machete!"". If you're actually looking for suspense, plot, or any semblance of tension, look elsewhere.",Friday the 13th
333,mokhatib,"Good production, weak story",5,25 February 2016,"The protagonist faces some difficulties and runs into a new fresh group of boys and girls, his new friends end up for about 15 minutes or more precisely during three kills that take place in or around the house,standing there like idiots doing nothing and all Clay summons up to say is :"" DO YOU HAVE A PHONE?"", and gives the address , and then says : THE KILLER IS OUT THERE, HE KILLED ALL THE LIGHT!! how cowardly did he sound??? So let's dwell on that point, the scriptwriters managed to introduce this new heroine strong male character who seems tenacious in finding his sister but ends up in one scene standing there cowardly, and doing nothing??? that's number one! Number two,It took Clay and Danielle more film time to go through the woods and their hike and check out the cabins then it took them to find it while escaping from Jason at the end of movie in about 30 to 40 minutes of film time, that's just sillyand even sillier is the fact they did not even find Jason's house. how come they could not find it before when they had more time and they were not running for their lives? And Clay's character who found out when he saw Jason carrying those dead bodies that he might have killed or hurt his sister, he decides to run like a chicken instead of facing him and finding out what happened to his sister, all this does not make any sense at all. If the producers and scriptwriters wanted to introduce a heroine, a leader, to help those kids or even try to help them and try to find his sister, wouldn't you at least give him some balls??? !!! If u think of it more, what was the real clear purpose of creating such a character and still have the kids end up dying and oh how cliché, he finds his sister??!!Three, Jason kills all the light, they call the cops, good, a cop shows, gets killed at the doorstep, they escape, but they don't find the keys to his car???  seriously? Lol and also unfortunately Clay loses his motorbike keys, OMG! In addition to those nonsensical things, is Whitney being tied up in a ragged up hellhole with all metal stuff around her, and all she needs is a broken GPS device so she can take a small part to unscrew her hand lock???? Come on! Four, I am sure the audience wondered just like I did why the hell did Jason keep the sister, why not kill her? It would be safe to assume that cus maybe she looks. Like.his  mom! Okay good, I can swallow that but we should not assume, the producers and writers should have reinstated that , enforced that, or played on it throughout or at some point in the movie, not only in the beginning where the sister's boyfriend remarks that she looks like the woman in the locket, and the end, in the final confrontation scene where she tricks Jason into letting her brother go and maybe he might think she is his mom, which brings me to the character of the sister, she has more balls in escaping and killing Jason than her brother has in the whole movie.Five, Michael Bay's influence is quite clear in the way he for the second time in producing classic horror remakes since Texas chainsaw massacre, he ages his characters in comparison to the original and makes super handsome and beautiful, like models, accept for the dorky tech freak in the first group in the movie and again there is another dorky Chinese guy in the second group. Another Michael Bay influence which is clear and taken from his own take on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the fact they make Jason run, think, plan, and set up traps, and build underway tunnels, and especially the scene where Jason is working underground and Whitney is tied up, all of that scene looks like Texas Chainsaw Massacre scenes. Six, I feel the movie is too lit and colored for a horror movie, two main colors dominate the movie, blue and fire-y yellow, I feel it is too much for a horror movie, these colors and this mood suits more a superhero movie, not a slasher horror movie. Also the make-up of Jason is too beautiful and nicely done, it over the top, not really realistic, I compare this to the idea of bringing model-like characters versus down-to-earth looking cast.",Friday the 13th

335,yodaccm,A Wasted Opportunity,4,18 February 2009,"For a movie being touted as a re-imagining of a classic there isn't much new going on with this newest installment of the Friday the 13th series. And I say this with much conflict because the star of these movies, Jason Vorhees, definitely deserves a fresh start. And this movie certainly does not do him justice.Once again teenagers, who look to be in their late twenties/early thirties, are being stalked and slaughtered by the seemingly unstoppable hockey-masked killer Jason. This time, though, Jason has two groups of horny and high kids to whittle away at with his ridiculous large and impeccably sharp machete.Yeah, you know what you are getting into when you go to see this movie. We aren't looking for high brow stuff. And with all the killings, T&A (which there is a decent amount of), and pot smoking kids, it's all pretty standard stuff. Even the kills are kind of uninteresting. And that's the problem with this movie. It's all standard stuff. Boorish characters making stupid decision about going into creepy cabins at night or going off to look for friends while a raving maniac is killing people. Hello, haven't there been like 12 other movies with the exact same stuff? For a movie trying to introduce a new generation to a horror icon, it seems like a half-assed effort. This movie is basically interchangeable with any of the other entries in the series. Nothing here sets is apart from the others or advances the Jason mythos. Yeah, the guy playing Jason does a good job, but c'mon. How much variation can you really get out of a character that is basically a mute, hulking killer. You basically have two variations of Jason from the series: the fast moving, human version from numbers 2-4, and then the teleporting, zombie version of 6 and on. This one fits the bill of the first few movies. Fast, but powerful and actually cunning.That's the thing with this version. It had so much potential to break the mold and take Jason in another direction. There is an idea in this one that Jason not only stalks his prey, but sets traps for them. A good idea, but it is never fully realized. Also, they show Jason's ""lair,"" a set of underground tunnels beneath the decrepit ruins of camp Crystal Lake. What does Jason do there? Who knows? All he is shown doing there is stashing dead bodies. Riveting. The movie has a sleek, finished gloss. It is a well made picture. But these days, what movie doesn't? The actors are garbage. The plot is non-existent, but there was never a plot in a Friday picture. The killings offer nothing new. The ending rips itself off. Jason deserves better. There is something to the character, people know this. That is why this movie reached number one at the box office its opening weekend. But this movie does nothing to elevate him above the countless other killers and monsters of recent horror fare. A simple, dirty hockey mask does not a memorable killer make. Do yourself a favor and rent this one along with the original and maybe number 4, one of the only sequels that are not too bad. Then you will see how bland and ultimately forgettable this new rendition truly is.",Friday the 13th
336,jamesharrah,Garbage!...Don't waste your time.,1,22 June 2009,"I for one was not expecting a lot from this so called ""remake"" and it did not disappoint. For one thing it was not a ""remake"". It was yet another ridiculous sequel to something that should have ended with part 3. There were so many things wrong with this movie. It had not one single element of atmosphere or that incredible creepy music (Harry Manfredini's masterpiece of music) that made the original what it was and is...a classic. Even the opening sequence was stupid. Mrs. Vorhees being beheaded and this little boy picking up her head afterward? Come on! In the original Jason had drowned (original script stated he drowned and was DEAD and that him coming out of the water to attack Alice in the canoe was a dream) some 20 years prior so therefore he was no longer a little boy. 5 minutes about his mom then BAM it was all about Jason. Jason, Jason, Jason. First he is wearing his nap sack on his head like he did in part 2, then low and behold he dons his hockey mask as in part 3 then there is that guy looking for his sister like part 4.What an absolute mess.This movie had so much nudity and sex it was like watching a porn flick instead of a horror movie. There was no shock value, nothing to make you uneasy except the awful acting and directing. I was also quite disturbed during the opening credits when I saw Sean S. Cunningham serve as producer of this garbage. He of course directed that glorious masterpiece of gritty horror being the original. I feel he sold out. And how he of all people could put his name on this is beyond me.As much as I detested Rob Zombie's remake of the classic ""Halloween"", I must say it was FAR superior to this trash. To this day I can not watch the original ""Friday the 13th"" at night while home alone: the music, the p.o.v (point of view) of the killer, the sense of isolation and atmosphere and being scared out of your mind. The original is perfect horror fare. This however, actually put me to sleep. I actually at one point almost picked up the remote to turn it off but I wanted to be open minded and try and give it a chance. It failed. All this was, was Hollywood producers trying to squeeze more money out of people and ripping a classic to shreds. This movie, not to mention all the ridiculous sequels after part 3 (part 2 & 3 weren't that hot either but at the end of part 3 Jason is lying dead with an ax in his head and that is where it should have ended), should not have been made. Complete and utter garbage. Whoever made this should be very ashamed of themselves.Any hard core fan of the original will agree that this was one movie that should have been left alone. But when one mentions ""Friday the 13th"" all they think of is Jason. Forgetting the fact that it was his MOTHER who did all the killing in the first. And I think that is what scares me the most, a grieving mother butchering people and not your typical male killer.So my rating for this is ""1"", meaning awful.Anyone who loves and covets the original ""Friday the 13"" should stay away from this and save your time, not to mention your hard earned money and just stay home and watch the original. At least you know for a fact you will be scared and not bored to sleep. Shame on you Sean S. Cunningham and all you producers who feel the need to rehash and blemish what was once a genre of fear...not dollars.Remakes and sequels. When will it end? Almost every single original was fine just like it was without the need for a remake. ""Psycho"", ""When a Stranger Calls"", ""My Bloody Valentine"", ""The Amityville Horror"", ""Carrie"", ""Prom Night"", the list just goes on and on. There has only been one remake that actually scared the hell out of me and that was ""The Hills have Eyes"". Reason being the producers and the director knew how and what they were doing. Rough movie to watch. Great stuff that is! Give it up Hollywood. Your not making these movies better. Your making them worse! If it isn't broke, don't fix it. And these movies, not to mention the countless other movies you will no doubt remake, were not broke to begin with.Others I am sure will disagree with me on my post about this awful movie and that is their choice. I for one will stick to the original.",Friday the 13th
337,Horrorfan1995,One of the best Friday the 13th Films ever,9,17 November 2010,"As a fan of the Friday the 13th franchise, I was very skeptical about this film, mainly for the fact that most of the time I'm against horror remakes. But I felt like the makers had no choice.Another sequel would have been difficult considering Jason has gone to New York City, was dragged to Hell then started to take control of people's bodies, went into space and became half machine, and then fought Freddy Krueger. But after seeing this film in theaters, I was amazed.This was probably one of the best Horror Remakes ever made. My only complaint with the film was the characters, most of them were your average Friday the 13th teens that do stupid things and end up getting killed with the exception of one character named Clay Miller, who is just looking for his sister who went missing.Jason Voorhees was definitely the best character in this whole film. He is a lot more clever then the old Jason, he preys on his victims in more unique ways.The kills were good, but not as great as the previous films, just a machete here and an axe there, nothing that we've ever seen before. So all in all, if you are expecting another Friday the 13th film, it will quince your thirst for kills and sex and other stuff.9/10",Friday the 13th
338,Verdugo85,Classic Jason!! Thank You Paramount!!,9,16 April 2018,"This is a good reboot. This movie brought back the roots of what made Friday the 13th films bloody entertaining except Jason goes to hell and Jason X, erase that outer space bs narrative off. Jason is in his human form slicing, dicing and running after his victims like the early Friday films from the 80s before he became the zombie version in part 6. Now, what gets under my skin is people bashing this movie, really?..really?...like really?..What did you expect from a slasher film titled ""FRIDAY THE 13TH""?? About a hockey masked killer murdering high-rolling, horny naive teenagers (Julianna Guill mmmm) in a summer camp, how simple? Duh!! Jason movies arent academy award winning material. They're entertaining b-movie slasher films. Marcus Nispel directed another reboot i enjoyed, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003) with Jessica Biel. When I read he was gonna direct this Friday reboot I counted that he'll do a classic job and he did. I was hoping the sequel get made with Nispel directing again but it didnt happen because they were trying to make Jason a ""bankable"" character, whatever. The only thing I didnt like about this film is Jason kidnapping one of the victims because she looked like his mother. No Jason, kidnapping is not your thing, your motto is ""kill kill kill ma ma ma"" but I still like this movie. Derek Mears played a good Jason, way better than that Frankenstein, doofy dude from ""Freddy vs Jason"". Mears Jason is similar to Ted White's from part 4 ""The Final Chapter"": agile, flexible, fast.",Friday the 13th
339,bozabozidar,A Routine Slasher Movie,6,22 March 2015,"I am a moderate fan of the Friday the 13th franchise. I still haven't seen the 3rd, 4th and 6th part, but I think that the first 2 movies and FvJ were quite good, whereas everything after the 5th part was plain stupid. Recently I have seen the 2009 remake and, honestly, it's nothing special.The movie starts of with a prologue mixed with credits that shows the remade ending of the 1980 version (Mr Vorhees' death). This scene is well executed despite being short. Then the movie jumps forward to present day where of course grown up Jason Vorhees is killing anybody who comes near Crystal lake. There is no need to explain the entire story as that has already been done on IMDb, so it is enough to say that Jason wants to brutally murder everybody except one girl that he kidnaps because she looks like his mother (similiar to a subplot in part 2). When it comes to deaths, I was surprised how easily people die in this movie. Jason uses his machete and other weapons; and most of the character get killed before they can even realize what's going on. Jason's murders are mostly violent, bloody and efficient. The special effects are superb and the violence looks very gruesome and convincing. In addition to gore, there is also a lot of (if not too much) nudity to ""spice things up"".The main antihero in this movie is somewhat like a slightly stronger & bigger version of himself from part 2. That means he does not have any superpowers or the ability to turn into a parazyte like in some installments, but is rather a monstrous huge human. However, this contradicts with some parts of the movie where Jason can literally TELEPORT himself. Seriously, there is a scene where Jason kills a guy in a tooshed and then moments later appears on the roof of a big nearby house. Then some timr later, another guy furiously runs through the woods and finds the nearby road, but Jason is already there hiding. This is completely unrealistic and doesn't fit the way Jason is represented. There is also a scene where one of his victims rips off the sack he had been carrying as a mask, so he replaces it with the iconic hockey mask halfway through the film.The biggest flaw of this movie is that it's not quite scary. The kills, although graphic and cool-looking, seem routinly done and the audience simply does not care whether a minor character dies now or later. There is absolutely no suspense; Jason just comes and mercilessly hacks somebody. The acting is average and the characters are all stereptypes, but it's clear that most of them are only in the movie so the bodycount would be 13 and there would be a lot of gore.All in all, the movie isn't unwatchable, but it's just an average slasher movie with plenty of violence and not enough suspense or frights. I'd say that the 12th installment is not the worst Friday the 13th movie, but it is certainly not the best either.",Friday the 13th
340,EricBosarge,"Omg, this movie is horrible",1,18 June 2009,"This movie was horrible. The original movies had something and were really awesome for their time. This is just another crappy remake a movie that was just fine in its originality. The characters are pretty much a joke and so is the plot. I tell you that if you want to waste your time that you can never get back, then this is the movie for you. The movie is kind of all over the place and other than a couple of nude shots of some young girls, there really is not a whole lot to keep you interested. You almost have to know the back-story of the originals to understand this movie, and then it still sucks. I cannot express my displeasure enough at this movie.",Friday the 13th
341,Demonic_Entity-1,Jason Is Back...Again!,8,11 August 2009,"Some time ago, Michael Bay and his company (New back then) known as, Platinum Dunes decided to remake the 1974 Horror classic, 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. They enlisted music video director, Marcus Nispel to helm the picture and Jessica Biel to star. When the news broke, fans were outraged, how could you touch something that is virtually perfect? The original was very dark, disturbing and gritty, I'll never forget the first time you see Leatherface in the film. He just pops out of nowhere and hammers the crap out of Kirk's skull, creepy scene.So fast-forward to 2003 and the film is released, I was a bit nervous entering the theater, fearing the worse. But then I remembered back to 'The Next Generation', there was no way it could be more terrible than that atrocity. Once it started and some time had passed in the film, I was pretty much relieved, I happened to enjoy the movie and give kudos to Nispel for some good direction. So naturally, when they approached him to direct the remake of another Horror classic, 'Friday The 13th', I was quite excited.'Friday The 13th' is my favorite film series, I love the character Jason Voorhees, I even have a tattoo of him on my arm. One would think I'd be furious to them remaking the original, however once I heard that Jason would be the killer in this installment and it would go back to it's roots, I couldn't wait to check it out. A quick re-cap of the original, deformed little Jason drowns at Camp Crystal Lake and his Mother becomes enraged and out for blood. She holds the counselors responsible for his death and begins a murder spree there until she is ultimately beheaded at the hands of Alice, a new counselor at the camp. She then sits in a raft and boom, Jason pops out of the lake and pulls her under, from then on, he has been the main antagonist of the long-running series.It was loaded with stomach-churning effects by the legendary, Tom Savini, written by Victor Miller and directed by Sean S. Cunningham, who helped produce Wes Craven's 1972 sickie, 'The Last House On The Left'. But in these times, the film has aged and in the following sequels, Jason has become an unstoppable super-zombie. It was time for a change and to go back to the basics, thus the remake. In this one, the ending of the original movie (Recreated here with an all new-cast) is the beginning and after the decapitation of Mrs. Voorhees in 1980, we are then forwarded to the present day. A group of teens head into the woods looking for a field of marijuana, after some time has gone by, our beloved killer butchers the teens in fast and brutal fashion. Our title card then comes in...after twenty or so minutes.From this point on, it's the standard, group of kids come to the cabin and get stalked and destroyed violently by a silent psychopath. And I loved every minute of it, Jason is back and better than ever in this new entry. He is fast, agile and mean as all Hell, he's also a bit smarter as well, such as setting up traps, using injured people as bait and even using a system of underground tunnels. The cast are all young and good-looking, consisting of Jared (Supernatural) Padalecki as Clay, who is searching for his missing sister (Nice nod to Part Four) Whitney, played by Amanda (The O.C.) Righetti. Others include Aaron (Disturbia) Yoo as stoner Chewie, Travis Van Winkle as rich-boy Trent and Danielle (Sky High) Panabaker as Jenna, Trent's girlfriend who befriends Clay and helps him search for Whitney, who has been kidnapped by Jason, because she resembles his Mother. Last but certainly not least is Derek (The Hills Have Eyes II) Mears as the main man, Jason Voorhees. Derek shines in the role, Jason has never been this ruthless and lethal, really well done job he did with the character, I hope he returns for the inevitable sequel.The movie is shot really well and the sets were awesome, I really liked the underground lair Jason had and his old house was pretty cool too. Seeing his bed and the toys scattered about, a nice nod to Part Two, with having the Mother's head stored away in a crude shrine of sorts. Marcus Nispel has really come through and showed his directing skills once again with this film. The writers of the remake, who also scripted 2003's kick-ass, 'Freddy Vs. Jason', Damian Shannon and Mark Swift, have crafted a great new Jason entry. They deserve credit for taking the series back to making Jason Voorhees a frightening character once again and grounding it (For the most part) in reality. The score (Ki-Ki-Ki-Ma-Ma-Ma) done originally by Harry Manfredini and now by Steve Jablonsky, is recreated here as well, but used sparingly, unfortunately. It seems like a slower version of the original.As for the kills, because that's what we all came here for, they are awesome, but could be better. Nothing overly gory or epic, but very mean-spirited and violent. I was a bit let-down here, but I still liked what I got. Machetes in skulls, arrows through heads, eyeballs skewered, throats impaled, axes in backs and even a person burned alive. The death-scenes are similar to something Rambo or The Punisher would do, Jason here is a hunter and an evil one at that. One thing that came through was the nudity, breasts are exposed left and right here and they all look wonderful, Julianna Guill (Bree), you are amazing.Overall, the film was highly enjoyable and entertaining, Nispel has done a great job with this movie and I hope we get the sequel soon. Just add a lot more gore and keep the tone gritty and brutal, have Mears return and we are good.",Friday the 13th

One day they had nothing to do, and ""Friday the 13th"" was playing at the Dollar Theater. Despite everything that his instincts told him...HE SAW IT! AAAAH! Okay, okay...I know that none of these films are supposed to be scary, just dumb but fun entertainment. And that's what the original was! The original was very fun! But this...the only reason this gets a 2 is because I loved the new Jason so much. He is fast, smart, and seriously more brutal. But everything else in the film is flat-out so-horrible-and-boring-and-not-even-remotely-fun that it should be avoided at all costs. AT. ALL. COSTS. I have come to realize that when Michael Bay says he is producing something, what he really means is that he is projectile-vomiting it. God help the remake of ""A Nightmare On Elm Street"". There's NO WAY it can be as bad as this was...right?",Friday the 13th
344,ScreamingBlackEyedPea,Uh.......NOT good,3,10 February 2009,"Okay, so this is the new Friday the 13th movie, and as you can expect, I'm pretty pumped. I just got back from a screening last night (feb 9th) and I am disappointed. It was just bad acting, bad plot, and extremely predictable. Danielle Panabaker is capable of doing well, but I thought her performance was quite dry. Jared Padelecki (sp?) delivered well. The sex scenes in it were totally unnecessary, and the cliché of the slut dies and virgin either A) lives longer than the rest or B) gets away KILLED ME. Some death scenes were planned well, and Derek Mears knows how to portray Jason well. The whole camping trip at the beginning was sort of dumb, and the couple that does it in the tent were so annoying and obnoxious. Direction, mediocre. But then again, my expectations shouldn't have been that high for a commercial slasher movie meant for mainstream America. To add, the film had NOTHING to do with the day FT13th! So, on Friday, consider your self lucky if you pass on this one.",Friday the 13th
345,dondanhernandez,Crap... Utter Crap,1,13 March 2009,"Okay so we have yet another remake that fails to attempt anything beyond your standard slasher flick. Let's see we have your stereotypical drunk teens, a crazy guy with a mask and a knife, the token black and Asian guys, the cheesy love triangle between two main characters, the asshole jock kid who turns out to be a pansy, and of course lots of uninspired death scenes, and a couple sex scenes for good measure. There you go the whole of the movie, every slasher cliché is present and accounted for, so when you go watch this be prepared for two hours of crap you've seen before. I have this to say, if you want to make or re-make slasher flicks give it to Rob Zombie, he's perfect for it, I mean look what he did with Halloween he gave it depth and story, made it interesting and hell he even threw in a couple clichés to stay true to the genre. All in all don't waste time or money on this, it should be buried somewhere and left to rot.",Friday the 13th
346,Phoenix_e13,great movie,8,13 February 2009,First of all i have seen all the jason movies. And i thought this was gonna be a wack movie like all the other remakes. BUT i was wrong.Everyone saying this movie sucked and there wasn't a real story.. neither did the other parts of Friday the 13th!This one was great in many ways! It catched me every single moment of the movie.. True..there wasn't a lot time spend on the characters background etc..but how has time for all that. It got traded in for some great kills :D. You know the story of the main characters or at least what they are doin there..so that was OK by me. Michael bay is probably the best director arround nowadays. If people were taking notice of the details. Like who remembers in the original parts of Friday the 13th someone was looking for the bottle opener? and he got pinned down by it through his hand!? In a shot of the house you could still see it pinned down in the kitchen! So they did looked at the details. This movie did what it was supposed to do! SCARE the SH@t out of people.. and it did :D,Friday the 13th
347,adamoconnell,I liked it!,8,15 March 2010,"Let's face it, this is a lot better than another sequel (a JasonX2? HELP). Why does everyone have such a big problem with this movie? I'm really starting to like it just as much as Final Chapter.First of all, the real reason to see this movie is Jason. It was great to see him go back to the woods and back to that sack. but now, he is no longer a lumbering zombie, he has the brains he started to lack around part 8. this is because Jason is human. He can't actually take as much as you would think. His design is great, he looks sinister in Bree's kill scene. The reason Jason makes his kill so perfect in this one is that he has been living in the wild. his tunnels around the camp are actually a great idea and I love his agility. I also love the scene where he turns on all the lights in the camp when he sniffs out a presence. It's great.Gore. Plenty of bloodshed. Not unimaginative, not over the top. Bree's is the best. Fantastic. I love stuff like how chewie wasn't just stabbed like usual, how Lawrence survived his initial run-in and was killed when Jason dropped him. i also like how he just appears behind Bree in her kill scene, how he drops down behind the cop, and how unexpected but hilarious Nolan's kill was. I laugh every time.Nudity. Some real hotties in this one! Everone knows about Bree, but what about that pointless wake-boarding scene with Chelsea. And America Olivio had a real nice rack. You should be careful of the final sex scene, though, its pretty hardcore.Characters. Almost everyone is trademark. A geek, a hot girl, a needless guy, a horny guy, a redneck, a cool dude, a dumb blonde, a stoned guy, a black guy, a slutty girl, a dull cop, a rich prick, a good girl, a hero guy and the final girl. Cliché but they work.Story. Overall, this is really good story-wise. Not confusing, not to simple. Not as straight-forward as Final Chapter, not as messed-up as JGTH, just ice. You can follow it, but not fall asleep.What it all boils down to is that this is a highly underrated slasher film and one of the best horror remakes i've seen. EVER!!",Friday the 13th
348,DanOS1994,Jason's back for the 12th time..,7,26 August 2010,"The Friday the 13th series continues this time with part 12. In 1980 Jason's mother killed all who trespassed on the grounds of Camp Crystal Lake, but eventually it backfires and she is killed by one of the trespassers (beheaded with a mace)so her son Jason completes the dirty work and vows to kill all who come near so what happens? Well to start the film off a young group of people (early 20's)go out camping in search for some drugs to sell, and unluckily for them they decide to stop at Camp Crystal Lake, so one by one they are all killed.20 minutes into the film and second lot of young adults show up and stay at one of their father's summer house, which just happens to be on Crystal Lake ground. The young group run into a guy called Clay Miller who is searching for his missing sister (Jared Padalecki - Supernatural)but little does he know his sister was in fact one of the people from the first group and has been held captive by Jason for a month underground. Will Clay Miller save his sister and survive? And Will this be the last of Jason? (watch the film to find out more)My Opinion - I have currently watched this film twice and decided to buy this film on DVD (£3) and to be honest I enjoyed it. It contains a good blend of action, slight horror and survival. I personally recommend this film if you like horrors and gore. *This film contains several minutes of female nudity*All in all I give it a 8/10+ Good Story + Believable Acting + Not too much Horror + Good Atmosphere - Some deaths are a bit basic",Friday the 13th

F hell finally to the good stuff. First up i love the new Jason he more of a lean mean fighting machine in this 1 he is more of a hunter and is leaner that we have seen him b4 he is also very clever and we learn about how he gets around and patrols his territory using an alarm system. He is also more ruthless and has a more sadistic and cunning way about offing the characters2 of my personal favorites are the 1 with the sleeping bag over the fire and the ass whole c*** gets stuck on that fork thing on the back of the truck.It was also nice to see some more of his origins around how he got his mask as well.all in all i hated the movie, apart from the new bad ass Jason who just by himself is worth watching the movie for and for all those haters out there just think of our friend Mr. Voorhees killing all our pet hate stereotypical loser I'm cool characters 2 bad they couldn't throw in the nerd and the fat guy into the mix as well but u get what you can take.final thoughts this movie script and character wise is 1/10. While the new Jason makes this movie is awesomely lifted to 9.69/10",Friday the 13th
350,Nirgaul,No suspense,3,15 February 2009,"This is a sub-genre that has fed so well on box office that there was nothing left to devour but its own origins. If only they understood them. The new method is to make the killer bigger and more menacing, so we get Pro Wrestler Jason. The characters are introduced as faces, not as lone backpackers or ensembles, so we understand what is being advertised. Its not their circumstance that matters, its that they are high grade sacrificial material from the altars of Gap and Hollister. Then you hire a director from a music video background who can handle a tight production schedule, and you've got box office gold. And it sucks. The original 4 may have been so plot less that it was an obscenity, but some of the suspense was done better than we've ever seen. Jason was just a physically strong lunatic with a hunter's instincts, and some primitive spiritual notions about resurrecting his mother through sacrifice. It wasn't just about revenge, it was that he possessed a sort of magical thinking, where he believed it was possible to bring her back if he killed enough. He wasn't driven by anger as much as the fear of perpetual abandonment. So he set out to find his victims, but the magic never worked. Stupid kids just kept coming. And there was always an oracle. Crazy Ralph, then the guy with the goat's eye, then the computer that tells Crispin Glover he's a ""dead f***"". It was a simple formula that worked because it stayed barely within the margins of belief. The only magic involved was that the prophecies came true, otherwise, it was like watching a horrible news headline unfold before your eyes. There was some ritual to the audience participation, as well. Vicariously participate in the blood-letting of Friday the 13th, and you've rid yourself of bad luck. All the ingredients of a classic fairy tale.I can remember seeing the cardboard standups and posters in early video stores for the first four Friday the 13ths. The artwork for the first in particular sets up the folk legend perfectly. Everything you fear about being lost in the woods at dusk. It was primal and felt like it could happen on a really bad day.",Friday the 13th
351,JMT-Studios,"In My Opinion, Much Better Than The Originals",6,11 June 2014,"So this may anger fans of the original movies but personally I can't stand them. They look bad, the effects are bad, they're acted bad, it's just all bad. Don't say it's cause they didn't have what they do now cause with movies like The Thing coming out around this time, the movie could've been waaaaaay better.So why do I hate the originals but like this one? Well maybe like a lot but more than the first one? It's just much more entertaining. Is it acted bad? Yes, but not in the way the old ones were. Those were movies where people actually tried and failed. This one is more people acting like the people of the originals. Intentionally acting it campy like. It follows the rules for horror movies that the originals created but executes them in much better fashion. 6/10This is one of those movies that I feel knows what it is and doesn't try to be much else. A movie that's bad but fun to make fun of. While the originals, to me, just put me to sleep and aren't even enjoyable to poke fun at. It's actually more frustrating watching those people.",Friday the 13th
352,dv909,Scary!,7,26 February 2009,"Finally got to see F13 '09 and I really liked it.Jason hasn't been this scary since pt4.I thought the movie was creepy, gory, and WOW! those women were HOT! The hottest ever, actually. But yes, the sex was way overdone. Sure there was gratuitous nudity and 'soft' sex scenes in the earlier films. But the sex scenes in the new F13 are without a doubt 'soft porn', and I found it distracting. I thought the 'kills' were very effective. I didn't see where they were coming in the water skiing scene. Got me completely by surprise. The 'under the dock' kill was brutal. And 'throwing the axe' is classic Jason Voorhees. And I think Derek Mears captured Jason's intensity very well. I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel nervous in a number of scenes from this movie.I really liked the characters Clay and Jenna. They worked well with each other and I was rooting for them. Felt sorry when Jenna got the arrow through the heart. And I was a little disappointed when I thought Clay bit the bullet. I think that's a credit to the filmmakers when you feel somewhat invested in the characters. Helps lift the movie above the basic 'kill, sex, F**k you' dialogue' inherent in slasher films. I also couldn't wait for some characters to be dispatched, which is where F13 movies have always been the most fun.However, the music was unmemorable and flat out bad. I have no idea why the filmmakers chintzed on this. F13 has a distinct score. If they're gonna go all out on rebooting the franchise, why not include the music? Do the filmmakers perceive the audience as strictly unsophisticated teens with no appreciation for movie soundtracks? Ha, probably. Yet if so, then they should enlighten their audience to the relevance of a solid musical soundtrack, which again lifts the film above typical slasher genre. And where the hell was the ""Ki Ki Ki, Pa Pa Pa...?"" I remember hearing it in 3 places only. When the title came on, when Jason discovers the mask (cool scene! even checked himself out in the mirror) and at the very end. Not cool! Yep, a little too much shaky cam, a little 'over' dark or just incomprehensible in some scenes, to many freaking 'whooshes'... I could nitpick some more, but what I found glaringly missing was the back story which fell prey to the time constraint. This film crammed parts 1-4 into one movie. There were many visual cues from the previous films that I thought was nicely done. But a lot of the back story (mythos) was missing and that bugged me. I would've chopped out the first group of kids (just have the girl turn up missing) and spend twenty minutes doing the last twenty minutes of F13 pt1. That is just my first impression however being that I've only viewed the film once.All in all, F13 '09 was a worthy entry into the franchise in my opinion. And can't wait to see where they go from here.Peace.",Friday the 13th
353,muvcritic,"Friday the 13th Reboots Popular Franchise, for No Real Reason",5,25 October 2010,"""I'm not from around here, but I'm looking for my sister. She's gone missing."" -- Clay (Jared Padalecki)Some movies are simply remade, but if a studio is trying to relaunch a lucrative, multi-picture franchise, the operative word is ""reboot,"" which indicates not just a remake, but a re-invention of some of the franchise's elements which assumes none of the previous films ever existed. In the slasher genre, we've seen reboots of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween, but I question whether director Marcus Nispel's Friday the 13th is a true reboot, since its opening moments are a fairly faithful recreation of the climactic moments of Sean Cunninham's 1980 original. Perhaps, like Toho's reboot of the Godzilla franchise in 1985, this Friday acknowledges the events of its first film, but none of the increasingly silly sequels.But the broader question is, why does Friday the 13th need to be remade/rebooted/reimagined at all?The most immediate answer is box office. Paramount Pictures needs to fill seats, and ever since John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween (still the best entry in the slasher genre), the unstoppable, superhuman killing machines Michael Myers, Jason Vorhees and Freddy Krueger (with occasional assists from Leatherface) have filled a lot of seats. Is watching teenagers get sliced and diced by mass murderers ""entertainment""? As sick as it may be, it obviously entertains some people, and that doesn't necessarily auger the breakdown of Western society. The truth is, kids used to see real death before the dawn of the movies, whether it be the slaughter of food animals on the family farm or a public hanging or a nearby battle. Death as entertainment has a long history, already popular even when the Romans institutionalized it in the arena. The lurid attraction of the slasher genre isn't a new phenomenon; it may even be a more civilized expression of society's age-old bloodlust because no one actually dies. And then there's the strangely puritanical subtext of these films: If teenagers sneak away to have sex, Jason is their punishment, like some instantaneously fatal STD.So how is the new Friday as a film? After its mostly undistinguished predecessors, Nispel (director of the uneven but ambitious Pathfinder) has crafted what may arguably be the best film in the series, in terms of its staging and production values. But after a steady and methodical buildup in a creepily evocative atmosphere, and coaxing passable performances from his young actors, Nispel simply loses steam. The movie doesn't really end, as such; it's more like somebody said, ""Okay, we're out of film.""The worst thing about Friday the 13th is that it's content to regurgitate the familiar formula without adding anything to the mythology. In that case, what's the point? You might just as well drag out your DVDs of the old series, which now look curiously tame.",Friday the 13th

355,cchires,High Production Quality without a Soul,5,31 August 2009,"The producers obviously put money into the new Friday the 13th as it looks sharper and more technically proficient than any other outing in the series. The drawback is that based upon what's on screen, it's hard to justify any reason to see it. I couldn't get interested enough in the story or the characters to feel any suspense for how the story unfolded.There were also plausbility issues with the story that were distracting. I know that there is a certain suspension of disbelief that has to be applied to every f13, but even within this films world there has to be some bounds to realism. For instance, the movie begins with an expedition to search for some cannabis plants in Jason's woods. Considering how fast Jason dispatches all intruders in his area, it is highly doubtful that anyone could plant cannabis much less take care of it in these woods. Furthermore, when the woman who has been held captive by Jason is discovered, not only does she still look flawless, but she is able to get on her feet and run which is a surprise since she has been held down by chains for six weeks.The production design is also a disappointment. Where the woods in the first movie looked creepy and foreboding, in this movie they look more like a travel brochure. I never felt any sense of mystery or intrigue from the abandoned Camp Crystal Lake either.There are some good things in the movie. Some of the dialogue of the teenagers is funny. The look for this Jason is interesting. The editing of the water ski scene was well done. And this movie has the one scene that I have been waiting for a long time to see in slasher movie: Finally a man gets to scream hysterically as the killer chases him.",Friday the 13th

357,HairyBussy,Derek Mears should be jason for future films,7,9 October 2021,Friday The 13th is not a franchise I've ever really been super into I was more into Texas Chainsaw Massacre and A Nightmare on Elm Street and always found Friday the 13th to be a bit boring and clichéd but I first saw Freddy Vs. Jason when I was like 7 it was the first film I'd seen of either franchise so at the time I was somewhat into Jason than this film came out when I was like 9 and i was pretty hyped for it i saw it and really enjoyed and hadn't rewatched it until recently expecting it to be total garbage and actually quite enjoyed it I was shocked to see all the hate this movie gets its honestly probably the last good horror film remake to come out and is this really any different compared to most Friday the 13th sequels? Because really I don't see what else they could have done with this movie you get good kills and in my opinion a really good Jason Derek Mears was a really good choice for jason voorhees and honestly should have been Jason in Freddy vs. Jason either him or Kane Hodder the characters aren't anything much but most of the characters in Friday the 13th films aren't nothing special either and it's way more entertaining than parts 1 & 2 in my opinion and I'm not saying this is an amazing movie by any means but for a modern slasher film it definitely delivers I just sort of look at it as a huge budget fan film paying homage to the original series thats honestly all they really could have done unless they decided to take it in a completely different direction which everyone would have hated at the end of the day I'm fine with this being the Jason of my generation I couldn't imagine any other person in the modern day to play him.,Friday the 13th

In this? Jason is elaborate and trap setting. At one point he even kidnapped a girl and kept her in an underground dungeon. Remind you of anyone? Yes, What I am getting at is that in fact Jason Voorhees is immensely similar to none other then Leatherface himself. But not just any Leatherface.. I don't mean the overweight inbred hillbilly from 1973 I'm talking about the renovated and remodeled Leatherface from Texas Chainsaw Massacre the remake and The beginning... hmm... who produced that again?? Michael Bay! And who produced this movie? huh whatdaya know? Michael Bay. And who directed it? Marcus Nispel our Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake man? Yep. So you tell me. Coincidence? I think not. I'm not a huge Jason fan. I like the original Friday the 13ths but they aren't my favorite. But this movie is just too plain. To begin with I think they should have done it more like the original with the camp re-opening. Yes its a re-envisioning but a bunch of teens partying at a lake house was done in part 3 and 4 so its not like thats anymore original. They could have had the camp opening with the teen councilors alone and just mixed it up. More inventive kills, a new twist, it would have worked. Now let me go into the first victims. At first you see the whole tragedy in which Pamela voorhees is killed and blah blah blah. Now that wasn't too bad in fact I thought they did that well but our first victims were 5 teens... Way to many. Now they should have had Whitney and her boyfriend alone maybe. But i think 5 is way to many for the first victims. Next let me touch on our ""survivor girl"" and I am going to go into a major spoiler so be warned. All through the movie you see Jenna who you assume is our surviving-virgin-final girl but no. The captive girl Whitney who's brother Clay goes through the whole movie looking for her survives along with him and Jenna who is focused on way to much dies now this would've have been a good twist if played out and directed right. All I have to say in way of violence. Totally un-original deaths. Unlike the the original Friday movie which is one the first movies to feature inventive and interesting deaths. (MAJOR ENDING SPOILER) The ending could have been all new and original. BUT NO they HAD to use the same old ending from the first, 2nd and 4th, it was a mash up and yeah, I really think they could have done something all new that shocked the audience as badly as when the first came out. And, Never I repeat NEVER cast well known names. Especially ones such as Danielle Panabaker-Miss Disney. No. Its just.. No.This movie was just too elaborate and planned out which took away the good old school slasher feel. It rely ed more on sex and un-clever lewd jokes instead of jump-out-of-your-seat scares and basic hack 'em up feel. Michael Bay.. You have failed us. I like the new Massacre movies.. enough so that I forgave your terribly insulting Ametyville Horror remake and you were completely redeemed with with the amazing Hitcher remake. But now I have re-lost faith in you. It keeps me up at night worrying about how you may mutilate my beloved Freddy Krueger in the oh so not anticipated Nightmare on Elm Street remake.",Friday the 13th
359,Pilatunes,An astonishing lack of imagination or scares,1,28 January 2010,"It is possible to resurrect a series that has run of gas. Until 'The Dark Knight', Batman looked as though it was pretty well played out. However, this rendition of the Friday the 13th franchise will only drive another machete through its barely beating heart.The only part of the movie that offers any kind of visceral appeal is a relatively tame sex scene where we get to see Julianna Guillard in her naked glory...and glorious it is. Even then, the dialogue makes one want to press mute and admire the view.The characters redefine what it means to be a caricature, they are mostly slightly irritating and generally seeing them vanish one by one would be something of a relief if it wasn't for the fact that their deaths are a) precipitated by acts of unbelievable stupidity (that no one would really do) and b) as gory as possible, simply for the sake of it.And one can only conclude from this movie that Jason Voorhees is actually a phantom. He seems to materialize out of nowhere in scene after seen...presumably the people who made this movie didn't have the imagination to find a way to insert him into a scene.Last, can they not get away from this tired formula of a killer/zombie/monster who generally moves around rather clunkily yet somehow manages to catch up to an athletic teenager running flat out? Or is this another case where we are supposed to assume that Jason can dematerialize and reconstitute himself at another location whenever he chooses? This movie is yet another dreadful chapter in this worthless series, and is yet another contribution to Hollywood's current obsession with gore and cheap shocks taking precedence over any real effort to craft a story or build real tension.1 out of 10.",Friday the 13th
360,dlo540,Not worth the hype or anticipation,2,21 February 2009,"If you are going to see this movie, expect exactly what you have seen before in Jason movies. First and foremost, the amount of sex was unbelievably unnecessary. I felt like me and my friends went to a soft porno theater. Secondly, there is no concrete plot. In fact, there are so many plot holes, I heard questions being whispered around me by other people. (For the sake of you die-hard Jason fans reading this, I will not state the questions because this is a non-spoiler review). But honestly, save your 8 bucks and put it towards a decent dinner or a beer. This should have never been made and released to theaters...MAYBE released straight to DVD.",Friday the 13th

It isn't that bad because of the rating, but pretty close.The characters. The acting is okay, but to me, bad writing. Jason the Killer was pretty the same, only difference is the cover. The town. It's just a copy of the original, only with a modern setting. Also, the film was set in 2009,
(Horror should get better by then) meaning it reminds me of 2013's ""Carrie"". The actors were fine, but it's nothing like the original, which is far superior, look at the rating. This is just my opinion, no hate.",Friday the 13th
362,gerrard2,Mega!!!!,9,27 November 2010,"I remember seeing this in the Cinema and the night before i read reviews for it and it was being totally panned by the critics but, i decided to go see this film anyway and I'm glad i did. The film in its criticism is by no means scary what so ever but it has an eerie feel to it due to dark texture and lighting by director Marcus Nispiel. its not an out and out remake its sorta a newish film with important elements from the first three films put together like Pamela Voorhees killing, Jason discovering the hockey mask ETC. Many of the cult fans of this film have generally slated the film because they said ""Jason doesn't run"" Well if these fans casts their minds back to Friday the 13th part 2 they should remember that Jason ran quite a lot in that film.The producers of this said they wanted to make this a fun horror movie and they have created a fun horror movie. Its amazing really how film critics are meant to represent the public and how they think the film will fare with fans and they always slate horror films but praise politically based films.This film is a must see from the director of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (not Tobe Hooper) and it certainly surpasses his remake of the TCM.",Friday the 13th
363,ajh193,Not Bad,6,7 March 2009,"Although I agree with many of the negative comments, ironically, I liked this movie. The effects were excellent compared to the old version and in my opinion, as far as scaring the audience does, it did its job. Things I liked: 1) The opening was insane. A lot of people didn't like it.. I thought it was awesome. I like the different styles in which he kills people. 2) The ""jump"" scenes--there were many of them. 3) The ending. I understand that in every past movie the ending has become cliché; but it's still classic. 4) The scenes were climactic. Obviously whenever someone is moving dramatically slow towards a shower curtain and the scary music is gradually growing louder, the killer ISN'T going to be behind the shower curtain. But you're waiting to see where he's going to be/or when he's going to appearProblems with this movie:1) I agree with what people wrote about the excessive sex scenes. In all seriousness, what does two people having hardcore sex or going wave boarding topless have ANYTHING to do with the plot of the movie? Was there any point in insinuating that the black character was going to pleasure himself to a lady in a catalog? Same thing goes for the drugs... 2) In accordance with other reviews, why does everyone keep talking to themselves? Like when the Asain character (Chewie) is stumbling around in the shed, drinking excessively and speaking to himself. After a while I kinda wanted him to die. I find it retarded that he HANDS Jason his machete. really? really.Overall, I liked the movie. The acting was adequate and it was very scary & climactic. It keeps you constantly on the edge of your seat, which is what a horror film is supposed to do. 7/10",Friday the 13th

365,savagebiteme,A Good Remake,7,30 October 2013,Honestly the Friday the 13th series vary in quality from entry to entry. This one is every bit as violent as it's predecessors. I think this remake is pretty skillfully done and better than many of the other entries in the series. My taste for violence in movies has changed as I've gotten older but I can't argue that this movie is much better than the Halloween remakes. I saw this with a friend and it was really effective in keeping me on the edge of my seat even though I was pretty sure what was going to come next. A good scary popcorn movie. Hopefully if another one is made it will be up to this standard. Taste is subjective and there is always some joker that wants to criticize taste. For this I always have to add that disclaimer.,Friday the 13th
366,ralph_2ndedition,Put down the slasher franchise and come out with your hands above your head!,2,18 February 2009,"I really wanted to be able to sit here and say that Marcus Nispel did it!I wanted to be able to claim that he'd given this almost 30 year old, tragically stagnating series a much needed adrenaline boost.That he had gone above and beyond the call of duty to bring new life to Friday the 13:th and Jason Voorhees.But I can't do that, because this movie  to be completely honest  sucked!Paramount numbered their Friday-movies all the way up to incredulous looking roman number eight, before they gave up and tossed the series in the garbage bin  where New Line Cinema, ""the house that Freddy (Krueger) built"", quickly picked it up and kept on going for two more, not very awe inspiring, movies.So when Paramount, New Line, Michael Bay and Marcus Nispel joins forces to make an, amazingly enough highly anticipated, ELEVENTH attempt, I don't know why one should expect something better, something more or even something new Because no matter what you expect it's probably to much.It's like there is a formula for the chain of events in these kinds of movies  a strict pattern by which it should be sewn together  and everyone is just refusing to let go of it!Part of the story lines in the three first installments in the series have been borrowed, twisted, manipulated and cut together, a bunch of tweenagers in the middle of the woods has been added to the mix and the alcohol, drugs, sex and naked tits has then been poured into the bowl, right up to the very edge. The most likely leaflet-thin script has then been filled with reasons to break the small group apart and send them to separate, dimly lit corners (I've never been able to grasp why a big guy like Jason can't handle four or five of them at once!). -Do you really want to know the story? Does it really matter? Alright, but it's not worth your precious time Clay Miller (Jared Padalecki) is in Crystal Lake searching for his sister, who went missing six weeks earlier  we, the audience, saw her getting attacked by Jason. Clay meets a bunch of Johnny Knoxville/Ashton Kutcher/Paris Hilton/Lindsey Lohan-wannabee's gathered in a cabin by the lake to  well, you know it already; booze up, get high and f**k like rabbits all night long Or something like that. At which point the big guy obviously shows up (initially with a cloth bag over his head  but after a while sporting the famous hockey mask) and starts taking them out, one by one.The movie, by the numbers, looks like this: 95  the movies running time in minutes. 13  the number of tweens in the movie (8 guys, 5 girls). 13  the number of people Jason kills in the movie. 8  the number of times Nispel has Jason towering up behind his victims. 4  the number of people I shared the enormous theatre with. 3  the number of topless girls in the movie. 3  the number of times I looked at my watch during the movie. 2  the surprisingly few number of sex scenes in the movie. 0  the estimated number of times I will see this movie again.This might feel like unnecessarily harsh criticism, and when I say that I'm just so tired of watching an endless string of generic kids stare stupidly into the dark and go ""Hello, is anyone there?"" one might think I'd choose to watch another flick. But I am, believe it or not, a big fan of the Friday the 13:th series, and somewhere I was hoping for a fresh start. I wanted to see an interesting  albeit not amazingly good  slasher movie. In short; I was expecting  maybe out of childish naivety fuelled by burning nostalgia  something more that the same thing over and over again for the (onehundredand)eleventh time.I'll give Marcus Nispels Friday the 13:th what I consider to be a very generous TWO-star rating, in recognition of Daniel Pearls amazing (as always) cinematography-Michael Bay, Marcus Nispel.

368,DanielJosLeary,"Nothing new. Why be a ""remake"" when it's just another bad Jason sequel?",4,17 February 2009,"The biggest problem with this new Friday the 13th is that is that it is simply everything that has been done in the franchise 11 times before. Except for a handful of moments that conflict with continuity of the previous movies this one could easily have fit in as a sequel to the previous films. I expected an actual remake since given that's what the filmmakers and actors talked about in early interviews. But this ""new"" Friday the 13th does not retell the story of the first three films but instead gives us a new set of worthless teens to have Jason kill off, while loosely throwing in short moments of how Jason went from a bag to a hockey mask.I wasn't a big fan of the new Halloween film but at least it took the story of the original and updated it, gave it more teeth and gave fans of the the original a sense of uncertainty of what might happen next. This new Jason film is nothing more then a poorly thought out continuation of what has made the later Jason films boring and predictable.",Friday the 13th
369,john_perry,Different is not always better.,4,23 June 2009,"First off, I will say that there are some good things about the rehash of Friday the 13th. Though I was less than thrilled when they announced they were remaking one of my favourite franchises from the 80s, a little part of me wanted to see how they will remake this.What's good about the film? The quality of film-making is much improved. Technically speaking, it's an attractive, modestly-budgeted film with great special effects. As well, the first 15 minutes of the film are strong, summarizing the plot of the first two films (Mother's massacre, Jason's revenge) and showing Jason as a stronger, meaner killing machine. It even gives a glimpse of how Jason actually lives, stealing from townsfolk and hiding in the woods, left to fend for himself.Now... what's wrong with it? The characters are extremely unlikeable. Aside from the three leads (Jenna, Whitney, Clay), I cringed at most of the one-dimensional, obnoxious characters, even though the acting were fine. This is a contrast from the older films, where the characters were memorable and most of the acting was bad.The plot holes. So let me get this straight... Jason is in the woods for all of his life, killing tons of people; yet the cops have no idea that anything is going on. ""People go missing every day"". The townsfolk don't, either. And, the majority of the plot takes place in a beautiful (and well kept) house in the woods owned by a character's rich father who goes there frequently... they never had a chance run-in with the maniac living in the woods for the past 20 years? The lack of subtlety. The old films flirted with peek-a-boo nudity, mild language and quick kills, making it fun to watch and more effective. This one features full-on, almost explicit sex, F-bombs dropping almost every minute, and long, drawn out, unpleasant kills that make it more tuned for the ""Saw"" or ""Hostel"" crowd. I'll note now that I'm not a prude, I have no problems with sex and violence, but sometimes less is more.All in all, I didn't hate Friday the 13th, but I hope five years from now I'll be watching Friday the 13th The Remake Part 5. Sadly, if they do make one I know I'll probably watch it.",Friday the 13th

Good for die hard fans and newcomers!!There's not too many movies I could watch multiple times and enjoy just as much every time. Great cast too! It might not necessarily be anything ""new"" but it certainly breathed new life into the franchise, modern Jason rules lol.I don't know what else to say, anyone who hates this doesn't truly appreciate horror movies.",Friday the 13th
371,jacktheraperx,Good movie but not a remake,10,14 February 2009,"I'm not even sure at this point if this actually was intended to be a remake, if you're a Jason fan or even an classic horror movie fan like I am then you'll know what I'm talking about.This is NOT a remake of Friday the 13th because it has nothing about the first one except for a couple of scenes at the beginning of the movie, some ""tributes"" to the old franchise and that's it! The killer of the first movie is Pamela Voorhes (Jason's mom), not Jason (I know! big 'no way!' right?...) and during the entire first movie we didn't even knew who the killer was until the very end, we don't see anything like that in this movie.Now, with all that, is this a bad horror movie? No. Is it a bad Jason/Friday the 13th movie? No. Is it a remake? No. Is it worth your money? Sadly, no unless it's on a streaming service already or if you're like me, a hardcore fan.This feels more like a remix of a Jason story... a mixture of the end of the first one combined with certain things from parts two and three but to me it only feels like a sequel.Now, the acting was quite good, Jared Padalecki gives us something to look forward with what feels like a very hands on performance and commitment to the franchise, the other actors do deliver and Derek Mears as Jason is just fantastic, I could see and feel and deduce what this version of Jason was about with only Mears' body language to guide me trough, and it couldn't have been easier for me as an audience to understand it (not an easy feat.) This is a good Friday the 13th movie, but it is NOT a remake in my book So go watch it, and see if you can spot the three actors from the ""Texas chainsaw massacre"" remake that make cameos in this movie.$0.02 -J",Friday the 13th

Crazy, but they did, and all the main male characters in this film have that haircut. But I digress.This iteration of Friday the 13th does a good job of upping the fear factor. Jason is menacing and brutal.As expected, the cast of characters are all two-dimensional and have no point other than to be fodder for Jason to kill in gruesome ways.One thing that is always funny about these sorts of movies is the hodgepodge of characters the director throws together. In what world does a wealthy college boy (sort of a jock) invite two stoners (losers) to his cabin for a weekend? He's not going to do that.Anyway, this isn't a perfect film, but it does a fine job updating the franchise and it's a shame Friday the 13th has been dead for 10 years now.",Friday the 13th

374,captrose,"Another Nispel ""masterpiece""",1,17 February 2009,"Here is the usual ""SPOILERS ahead"" warning. Read at your own peril!! I've always been a F13/Jason fan. Can't say I was excited about the remake being produced by Michael Bay but at least I hoped we would get some cool new special edition dvds (which we did). So expecting nothing and knowing I had my old favorites still to watch I went to check it out.Have to say I was under impressed. One of the charms for me about F13 has always been the fact the movies didn't take themselves very serious. The creators might disagree with that statement but come on, how do you explain his healing factor, the fact Jason never runs but somehow always get ahead of his victim and his ""victim radar""? This new movie tries really hard to make it ""realistic"". Jason runs (*sigh*) after his victims. (Runs? Runs? Jason doesn't run!) There is some sort of crazy mine below Camp Crystal Lake (?) that Jason now uses to get around (because the director wanted a mine. You know, a generic mine, not any particular kind). Along with bear traps and trip wires to let him know where people are. Some half buried bus to come out of ... somewhere on the camp ground. We only get one ""Kill, kill, kill, Ma, ma, ma"" when he finds the hockey mask. (I remember reading that the new creators wanted to have some ""meaning"" about why and where he got the mask. Guess they forgot that because it's the same thing, he finds it.) And oh yeah, not much happens at the camp because the producer, Michael ""Big Explosion"" Bay, thinks that summer camps aren't scary. That reminds me of the director for a Captain America movie who said he hated the costume so he kept the hero out of costume as much as possible. Where the Hell do they get these people? It's more of a remake of F12 Part 3, than Part 1 or Part 2 though there are parts of both in it. Nana Visitor is utterly wasted as the new Mrs. Voorhees. There are some great comments over at Stacy Ponder's Final Girl blog review. Then I found out something that would have kept me totally away from the flick, the director is the same guy who did the god-awful remake of Texas Chainsaw Massacre from a few years back (Marcus Nispel). Honestly, if I had known that, I wouldn't have wasted the $9.50 nor the time. But, I would have warned you my friends, this guy doesn't ever need to make a movie again. Let alone another ""horror"" movie.It's not totally horrible and I'm sure the kids who like the remakes of the current time will like it. But for this old timer, it takes the parts of F13 I liked and totally ejects them in favor or ""realism"". Honestly, it makes me worry even more about the upcoming ""new"" Star Trek.For old fans, I would recommend picking up the new versions of F13 1-3 and ""His Name Was Jason"". F13 P3 is finally in 3D, and His Name Was Jason is hosted by Tom Savini. All kinds of 80's slasher goodness there. Don't forget the original ""Valentine's Day Massacre"" just released, also uncut for the first time ever. You'll enjoy it more than this remake.I'll give it 1 hockey mask out of 5.",Friday the 13th

376,n-hungness,Horrible remake - avoid at all costs!!!!,1,7 July 2009,"Why would anyone take the story of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and then slap on the title of Friday the 13th???? I've seen the original Friday the 13th movie and all of its sequels of the 1980's, and even the worst sequel of this bunch is far superior than this 2009 remake. They should have called this movie Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2.Why is this movie so horrible? First and foremost, they tried to show a ""different"" side of Jason. That was my biggest turn-off in this remake. The Jason in this movie is something of a calculated hunter who keeps people chained up in his basement. The original Jason would've never been like that. Period. The original Jason was a cold and inhuman killer - you simply could not understand his motives because he was so evil and inhuman. He was a killing machine that never stopped and never toyed with his victims. He was a brutal monster. The new remade Jason is more ""human"" and less threatening, less scary. He essentially becomes a backwoodsman who doesn't like people on his turf.Secondly, the cast is too Dawson-Creekish for me. I like stupid teenagers getting sliced and diced in slasher movies, but these young actors and actresses really pile on the unnecessary drama amongst themselves and have too much of a social and political conscience. As if we care who they are. It's like the cast of a Scream movie decided to camp out and end up bumping into a territorial hunter in a hockey mask.Third, where did all that sex come from??? Since when did Friday the 13th turn into porn? I like nudity sprinkled into my slashers, but the amount of nudity and sex in this movie really makes you wonder just why in hell so much energy was put into the movie in the first place. I still haven't figured out if they really intended on making a slasher or a porn - the sex and nudity far outweigh the gore.If you're going to do a remake, do a freaking remake. Don't continue the story with a whole set of new characters and an entirely different plot. I was hoping to see a remake and instead I get a sequel 2009 style. Only this sequel is by far the worst made and should not at all bear the title of Friday the 13th.My recommendation - rent this remake if you want to see a movie that resembles nothing like the original. You're actually better off just watching Texas Chainsaw Massacre.",Friday the 13th
377,rwunder,This is what a horror movie should be,10,15 February 2009,"Hands down, excellent remake. This movie had absolutely everything that you could want in a horror movie.This story was told in two parts and both parts were linked. The kills were awesome; much better than expected. The characters were nothing new, but they were perfect for the story (especially the girls ;).The first part begins with some twenty-somethings on a hike in the woods looking for a field of marijuana when they unknowingly stumble on Camp Crystal lake and its lone, evil, inhabitant.Part two takes place six weeks later where we meet a group of young people out to take advantage of a weekend home. We are introduced to the brother of one of the hikers from part one who is searching for his missing sister. The weekend home is situated on the same lake as the camp and Jason shows us that in the first part he was only warming up.Every aspect for this horror movie was well done. Jason is badder than ever. The director holds no punches and just lets loose with everything he had. The on screen talent was great (for a horror movie - don't expect an award winning performance, we are talking about Friday the 13th here). The story was good and it moved along, the sex and nudity were top quality, the kills were awesome as well.With Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween and this remake of the classic, I'm pleased to see Hollywood going down this route. Both of these movies were very well done and they breathed new life into a stagnating and over saturated genre/series. I love it, bring me more!",Friday the 13th
378,njscreenwriter,Not very good,4,1 July 2009,"I, like a lot of people, am starting to get tired of these horror movie remakes. But they'll keep making them, because I'll keep watching them. Maybe one day I'll be surprised when a really good horror film gets made.This movie felt like it took too many elements from Saw and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake (same director?).It's pretty par for the course as far as Friday the 13th movies go. Lots of hot, dumb, blond chicks that make easy targets, the douche bag guys and the stupid stoners.I really didn't like the hostage situation - Jason doesn't seem that smart, and that girl looked way too normal for having been in that hole for 6 weeks. Jason must be a good host. She doesn't look at all malnourished or dehydrated! Finally they started developing two of the characters and then went nowhere with their story. The cute brunette, and the guy who was looking for his sister. It was obvious their characters were supposed to have something, but it seems like they abandoned that idea in favor of another kill, which was really, really unoriginal. That, and the guy could have made a good nemesis for Jason. But they kept them in the realm of typical cardboard cutouts. What a waste.This movie was fun enough to watch but ultimately it's just another slasher that I'm not even sure should be called Friday the 13th.",Friday the 13th

The death scenes were new and inventive and some were a slight homage to the original. There were some flaws with the films story. The gore and special F/x were good but I suspect they were cut down and will be better on the unrated DVD. Jason is good but they should have used Kane Hodder he really brings so much more to the character. The kill count is pretty high and really steady there is really no long waiting period the kills just keep coming and coming.Overall a pretty sollid horror film and not the best but a pretty good Jason movie.",Friday the 13th
380,massivelaughs,Welcome to the category of decent remakes,8,16 February 2009,"I was so happy that this was exactly how i expected it to be, after seeing 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' remake i was quite excited about this and glad Michael Bay and co decided to give the franchise some credibility that was lost some time ago.Premise is simple enough, crazy mother kills camp counsellors she feels responsible for her son's drowning, surviving counsellor kills mother, boy sees this happen and decides 'Yeah this is what i wanna do' cue some unfortunates looking to get stoned, laid and intoxicated, unaware that someone wants their limbs as trophies.The film has a pretty excellent first 20 minutes which sets the film up superbly, the scenery in the film is very creepy and whilst watching you honestly think 'i'm glad i'm not lost around there', Also they have assembled a really decent cast of young actors and the best thing is you really feel any of them could be for the chopping block.The film has some really funny one-liners, plenty of nudity for the guys (all the chicks in this film are hot!) and some superb death scenes, which for a Friday the 13th film is a must!!, also the song 'Sister Christian' by Night Ranger makes an appearance which gives the film an extra mark on its own.The only two issues i had with this movie was that whilst watching this, you will see one or two of the death scenes are repeated later on in the film and the 2nd Trailer that came out may have shown too many of the good scenes.Still i give this an 8 out of 10 as a fan of the franchise i recommend this to anyone who is not just a fan as well but who enjoys a bit of mindless murder, mixed with hot chicks and really good dialogue all rolled into one. Give it a try! Ch ch ch !! Ha Ha Ha!",Friday the 13th
381,wolfm72,Stop the remake wave,1,15 February 2009,"I saw this film last Friday. A couple left the theater before me, that was old enough, that they must have seen the original movie in the cinema back in 1980 and I felt sorry for them. They saw a classic back in the day and today they saw one of the most stupid movie remakes ever made. I mean expectations were running high (so were mine). But they were buried on this day. Please, stop making remakes of films that are classics. When I think of the upcoming The Thing, Last House on the Left or Hellraiser to name only a view, I feel sick to the bone. Why do you have to do something over for the second time, when it was made right in the first place. It's interesting that people (I don't know the exact demographic that this disaster was made for)like to see stupid teenagers, running around, doing drugs and getting killed (even in no exciting ways). The screenwriters have done their part ruining this movie big time by creating ""characters"" we, the audience, don't care about and give a damn if they are getting killed or not. The storyline was as thin as the characters and the ""hero"", Jared Padalecki should stick to his TV assignments. If all remakes are following now this route, it's better to leave them be and look out for something knew. It's also strange,that Sean S. Cunningham was involved in this mess. But maybe he was more interested in making money, than caring for a franchise that he has created, because, by all means even the worst entries in the old Friday the 13th movies were a million times better then this really horrible mess.",Friday the 13th
382,horrorfan8,"A Good Movie, Underrated If You Read the Negative Reviews",8,16 June 2009,"I guess I can say that most fans think this Friday the 13th ""reboot"" or ""sequel"" or whatever you want to call it, didn't like this installment. There are many factors I can put into why people wouldn't like this movie, and also parts they COULD'VE worked on more. There was a lot of sex/nudity to the point where it kind of go ridiculous. The writers and producers seemed to be real horn dogs for showing off tits and large breasts, while it kind of gave me a vibe that that's all they cared about mostly. Another thing is, they rushed Jason's storyline WAY too much. Only about 2 minutes are known in this film about his childhood, even his mother getting killed off right at the beginning. Then, there's the character development, which is a BIG BIG BIG role to get the audience to like/hate some characters. This movie lacked a lot in character development. I had a hard time keeping up with names because I never got to know the characters enough. Another thing is that they sort of spent on a lot is the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" feel. It seemed like a TCM film with Jason's underground lair, and keeping people captive, which lead the film to give off a different vibe. However, I am really not a critic in movies, I, however tend to like them or hate them. Friday the 13th (2009) I liked, it was a good movie. I would love to see less nudity, more character development, and less of a Texas Chainsaw Massacre feel. Also, I think this film gets a lot of bad reviews, but I understand why it would. Many fans probably expected it to be more like the originals, but it was far from it, and that's what makes a lot of die-hard fans mad. But, it's a writers viewpoint, not yours, so you have to accept that. All in all it was a good movie and don't forget to buy the DVD and Blu-Ray on Tuesday, June 16, 2009!",Friday the 13th
383,patstaciemcgue,The real Jason is back,10,11 August 2014,"Enjoyed the portrayal of Jason in this film. Its gritty, action packed and Jason is believable in this film (Derek Mears was outstanding). The teenagers in this film can be a little overbearing, but its the best version of Jason that we've seen since The Final Chapter. I was impressed with the level of action and the menacing look and appearance of Jason in the film. If you are a fan of classic horror films, you will enjoy this film. Looking forward to the next Friday in 2015. Not sure what direction they will be going in the next installment, but I'm hoping that Derek Mears reprises his role as Jason.",Friday the 13th

385,doucet_derrick,Friday the 13th - Don't Waste Time,1,17 April 2009,"As what several people will tell you, the first 15-20 min of this is extremely powerful. So powerful that the next 40 min or so is a complete melt-down. Jason looked badder than ever, and this looked like a great remake for the whole Friday the 13th story, then they introduce the main characters and you're left looking at the watch wondering when the movie will end by about the half hour mark. Yes, within 10 minutes the movie goes from entertaining so completely boring and lame. None of the characters were realistic, all they said were stupid one-liner quips and cheesy lines which lets face it, no one talks like that in real life or 1/100 do. Also they seemed so heartless, they practically didn't care if they're friends were dying. One guy opens a door sees the girl he just slept with hanging there dead, and no reaction comes from him. It's just ""Oh she's dead cool"" Well I got the impression he should have said cool. Also Jason is all of a sudden a master of weaponry, he like has all weapons at his disposal and at all different times. Arrows here, then this weapon, then another. Rarely the classic machete. It was pretty lame. The last point is that you could basically watch the first 20minutes, skip the next 40 and watch the ending. You would have seen the only good characters, seen the better deaths, seen the entertaining parts, understood the entire story and not miss a beat. Why watch a full length movie if 3/4 of the movie is useless garbage. I am a complete Friday the 13th fan, the original with Mrs. Voorhees as the killer and the movie in first person, creative and creepy, this was a complete let-down. Hollywood doesn't care about horror anymore, they prefer to had stupidity and comedy instead.",Friday the 13th
386,joeampfan,A nearly worthless remake,2,21 July 2010,"Friday the 13th fans beware of this one. The scares just weren't' there. Why does Jasons run now? And why does he think out his traps and all that. That is not how Jason is supposed to behave. He is supposed to be slow and scary and without thinking out plans and warning systems. Also, it makes no sense Jason would take prisoners. The killings are not memorable either. Not that it matters much, because no one is even slightly likable. They are all pathetic stereotypes that are more idiotic than the original characters. By the way, it was so laughable the way Jason held the girl because she resembled his mother. Seriously, unless you want to see a classic horror film destroyed, skip it, or if you must see it, catch it for free on TV. I was hoping this would at least have some good scares, but I was let down. Even the TCS remake was better than this and that is not saying much.",Friday the 13th
387,ced650,Above certain chapters of the saga,7,9 March 2010,"But in no way a remake of the first film, which was a pure slasher and hard, with unknown identity of the killer until the final. But if you look like a replay, or the writers are reclaiming myth when we pass a good time very entertaining. Including very good ideas, such as traps in the forest, or Jason taking one captive female characters. Although these ideas have nothing innovative in the cinema of horror, however, they provide a little more because if the film would have had a certain image of the aftermath of the saga was the worst was feared. When a Marcus Nispel, the radius remake it far outperforms its reading of TCM, with this film which is not very difficult indeed as a pack of horror productions are better than this remake of TCM. All to say that radius remake, we find much worse than this Friday the 13th has the merit of diverting more of a blow with dust has a wise man who badly needed.",Friday the 13th
388,danomychowski,Surprisingly excellent!,8,14 February 2009,"Based on the trailers for the movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. It looked, more than anything, like just another lame remake. This is the third attempt at a Jason movie from New Line Cinema, the first two being Jason Goes To Hell, and Freddy VS. Jason. Neither of which were particularly memorable. so this movie could easily have ended up like those two as another mediocre rehash. especially since it has the same writers as Freddy VS. Jason. Well believe me, this is NOT just another lame remake, nor is it just another lame rehash. In fact, I liked it a little more than the original. Granted, it wasn't really a remake, so much as a comeback vehicle for Jason Vorhees. Perhaps a better title for the film would have been Jason Returns--Again. the thing is, that writers Mark Swift and Damian Shannon GET Jason Vorhees. Whereas Freddy Kreuger seemingly wasn't exactly their specialty as was made obvious in FvJ it is clear that they are the ones that Friday fans such as myself have been waiting for. Of course, the film did have its Cons. The Pros:-Derek Mears was amazing as Jason. Naturally, he was a major improvement over Ken Kirzinger. In fact, he may just be the best Jason Vorheesbesides Kane Hodder.-The rest of the Cast were also great. They truly captured the essence the stereotypes inn which they played. They took the stereotypes and made actual characters out of them. Though the very comical, never taking itself completely seriously styled writing may have done much of the work in that case. -The Music was perfect for the movie. It sounded enough like the original music to give off that sweet sense of nostalgia but different enough to seem new and fresh. -The Nostalgia Factor! This was perhaps the best part about the whole movie. With all of its throwbacks to the originals and its entire opening scene, which was, in itself an awesome homage to the first movie, it left you feeling young again. Basically, it was almost, if not just as fun as the first film was back in 1980. It was perfect both as a re-introduction to modern audiences and as a nostalgic tribute to those of us who saw the original. Now we can go through the experience all over again, this time with our kids who, as we were when we saw the original, are way to young to see it!Of course, there was a Con or two thrown into the mix.-Amanda Righetti's character seems very out of place in the movie. I don't want to give anything away, but I didn't like her as the Co-main female lead. They should have left that to Danielle Panabacker, who I thought did great. -Jared Padalecki of Supernatural fame sold his role, but his character, as is his character from Supernatural, was just a bit too whiny for my taste. It was almost as if HE was the main Female lead.Other than that, I can't really think of any other notable Cons. When the movie is funny, It's laugh out loud funny. When it tries to be scary, it is scary enough. The action is intense, there are plenty jump out of your seat moments, and of course, what Friday movie would be complete without Five totally gratuitous Nude scenes?The film has every thing you could possibly want out of a Jason movie, as I have probably said before. It exhibits untamed Nudity and sex and uncensored Blood and gore--often within the same scene. And they didn't waste any time with a Crazy Ralph typed character, a character that I never particularly cared for.So I would once again lie to extend my utter gratitude to All who worked on this movie, and helped make it the re-boot we have been waiting for. And to all of those who worried about the involvement of Michael Bay: It looks like he finally made a movie that he deserves respect for. And Marcus Nispel did a decent job too, soon enough, the lame TCM remake will just be an event of the past, because this film more than made up for his past misfires. And to all of the parents of all of the teenagers who will obviously want to see this movie, If your kid has EVER seen a horror movie before (and I mean a HORROR movie, Prom Night and The Unborn don't count)they will not have any problem with this movie. And as far as content goes, It is rated R for a reason, but if your kid is over the age of 14, he has seen it all before, whether you know it or not.I look foreward to seeing the next F13 movie.",Friday the 13th
389,markanthonypowell,The best Friday in a while,7,14 February 2009,"I would suggest this movie to anyone who wants to see a good-well-rounded slasher flick. It's got the drugs, the nudity, some comedy, lots of suspense, and lots of blood. The script writing was very good, and should win some kind of award. The guys stuck with the genre stereotypes, but expanded. There were a couple of characters that seemed out of place. It was also interesting how one side of the lake, was upper class style, but the otherside was run down. Jason. Jason was creative in this one. He was a well thought out character. It was nice to see he had that ""internal"" struggle going on. And you know he was ""special"" when he drowned, but smart. You can see medals, and awards in his room, that show he has creative skills, which he uses when he kills each of his victims. The suspense was good. The director, and editors push the time line for when something is going to happen. Example: when our hero visits the old lady. They focus on the screen door, you know darn well the lady has a dog. But the seconds tick by, the camera shots cut from the door to the hero, to the door, to the hero, to the BOOM, I knew there was a dog, and you jump. There are many scenes like that. But then there are the ones when you are like, oh oh, BooM it happens, like right then. At sometimes you don't know who is going to get it, and the nice thing is that Jason keeps you guessing on how he is going to do it. Bravo to the writers. Eh to the direction. Good work to the editors, lighting, and the actors.",Friday the 13th
390,BogieandBacallfan,"Worst ""Friday"" Ever...Stick to Original!!",1,9 October 2010,"Okay...this is probably the WORST re-make of an original movie I've ever seen (except for maybe the re-make of ""Halloween"")! The acting was terrible, except for Jared Paladecki who is pretty good. But, his TV series ""Supernatural"" is better than this garbage! The directing and filming were awful as well. Everything was so ""choppy"" and seemed constantly out of sequence. Everything was also mostly done in the dark and half the time you couldn't tell what was going on. Jason was one place...suddenly seconds later he's at a completely different one...then back to the first place. You're left going ""Huh??"" But the biggest disappointment is the fact that this movie is NOT SCARY!! It's just SICK! There's a difference. The original ""Friday the 13th"" had you on edge and you never knew when the killer was going to pop out. It also focused more on the ""scares"" rather than how much you can torture a person. The original ""Friday"" is fun to watch...for as low budget as it was then, it still works! The old adage of ""the simpler the better"" majorly comes into play here. This re-make ""Friday"" is NOT fun to watch...again it's just sick. Want a good fright or scare flick on a stormy evening? My advice is rent or buy the original 1980 ""Friday the 13th""...or the original 1978 ""Halloween!"" The new re-makes of both these movies completely miss the point and are nothing but garbage!!",Friday the 13th
391,jickweez-1,Piece of crap horror remake,2,13 February 2009,"Unlike the excellent 3-D remake of My Bloody Valentine, Friday the 13th takes itself way too seriously. Sure it's peppered with jokes and comic relief but even this is heavy handed and awkward instead of seamless and funny. Whereas Valentine paid homage to the 80's slasher pics (almost reveling in its self-aware crummy dialogue, intentional bad acting, and gratuitous sex and gore), Friday the 13th fails to capture an ounce of the original's creepy fun or sense of doom. The remake has no style, no atmosphere (the lighting is horrendous), no direction - all of which the original 13 had in spades. The actors and flimmakers try too hard to squeeze a drop of fear from the ticket buyers, and only succeed in looking like they're trying too hard. But the true litmus test of any horror movie is whether it keeps the audience's attention. Sadly, the new 13 does not. After the first 20 minutes of nothing happening (it begins with the ""story"" of the inane ""teenagers"" instead of engaging us with a hook and hold involving Jason), I found myself nodding off throughout the remainder of the film, resulting in a 90-minute exercise in tedium.",Friday the 13th
392,xMartyMcFlyx,"Jason is back, and better than ever!!!",10,25 December 2011,"This movie was fantastic. I first saw it during it's midnight screening the night before it was released, and once again during opening night. (Both times the theater was packed to the brim.) This was a great movie to watch with a sold out theater, because everyone jumps and screams at all the right parts. As a huge, HUGE Friday the 13th fan, I was so excited when I first heard about this being released. I like all the Platinum Dunes movies (except The Unborn and Amityville Horror) and I couldn't wait to see what they were going to bring to the table. They hired the director from their Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake to helm this movie. Everything about this movie is awesome. The best part is the intro (the longest opening to a movie) where the name ""FRIDAY THE 13th"" doesn't even appear for about 20 minutes. The opening will surely have you on the edge of your seat! (I know I was!) I've seen every Friday the 13th movie, and I own them all on DVD. (Even the really bad ones like Jason Goes To Hell and Jason X.) I would definitely put this remake in my top 3 of my favorite Friday the 13th movies, along with part 2 and part 4. They really hit the nail on the head with this one, everything about it is fantastically well made. If you like Jason, or even if you don't and you just enjoy a good horror movie, please go buy this movie because you will definitely enjoy adding it to your DVD or Blu Ray collection.

This film has my favorite Jason out of the entire franchise and has excellent, bloody kills. The first 20 minutes of this film are the best first 20 minutes of any slasher I've ever seen. The changes they made to Jason in this remake were awesome in my opinion. Jason is far more ruthless than in any of the other entries in the series. The bunker was also a really cool addition. Many people are complaining about Jason running in the remake but if you're a true fan of the franchise you would know Jason can be seen running many times throughout parts 2-4. My only problem with this film is the character of Trent. He is the definition of a douchebag and the worst part is he is one of the very last to fall to Jason's hands. He just would not die. Overall, this was a great Friday the 13th and truly does not deserve the hate. Please give it a chance. For Jason. 9/10",Friday the 13th

This film is making lots of money from people who don't actually understand what a good movies is, therefor Hollywood will continue to make junk.Things that i did NOT like- #1. All actors sucked except Yoo and Mears.#2. The kills were ultra boring.#3.Why does everyone shop at Abricombe & Fitch? #4. The camera shake deal has been done and done. Enuff of it already. It's obvious that directors use this to cover up the fact that they can't actually film a fight or action scene.#5. All the things I don't like about the first 10 Fridays are used in this re-make. However anything that I love about the first 10 films are not used at all.#6. Enuff with models that cannot act but are used to show off boobs. Some of us Horror fans are smart. Please don't try to divert my attention from the good stuff that is actually missing from the film.#7. The strongest person in the film is a 90lbs. girl that has been chained in an old mine shaft for 6 weeks without proper food or drink although is able to effortlessly ram a 4inch wide machete through the chest plate of a 250lbs. Voorhees.#8.Does everyone in the world smoke pot? And if you do is it really the most important thing in your life? #9. Dialog......it's important.#10. Did anyone like the garage with all those wonderful tools that Jason did not use except for an axe ""that Jason had to stop and pull out of wood"" and throws it at the fastest runner in the film and catches up with him? And to top that off he's 15ft. from the house and yet no one in the house can see him...#11. No offense to Mears, he is an excellent stuntman but Nispel did not let you show enuff of the rough stuff. The fights were soft and super short.12. Although the sound quality is very good in this film, is it really necessary to have that cliché' dark ages sword sound all 5 times that he pulls it out of a leather sheath? Again this is the type of thing that is used to help dumb people get a sense of horror. Another fave is when horror films use creepy music......before the scare! This is also used on TV shows with laugh tracks. It's to let the mindless audience sitting at home that it is now OK to laugh because a joke just happened.#13. The Jerk. Does anyone know of a bigger jerk? This dude played the part as if it were a SNL skit. Super lame.I did find one thing that I did like about this remake. The sets. The sets are very cool and looked real. I guess thats the one nice thing Bay did for this film. A big budget.I sometimes wish I was as dumb as most Americans. You know, the ones that think we are at war to fight the ""Terrorists"" and we are not actually over there for oil. This way I could enjoy horror films these days. Or so that I could laugh at stupid lines like ""thats one fierce pussy"". 80% of the guys in the theater laughed at that. Ummmm i said things like that when i was 13.

Jason Voorhees had been, literally, scaring the crap out of us for 3 decades now and it has been 5 years since we have seen him last and now to be completely hones; I was not disappointed. It has all the elements of a great scary movie and anyone who says that they don't get at least a little afraid out by the man in the mast it a LIAR! You can see through the movie that some of the deaths have been done before but have a little more twist now and that is just fantastic. I have read what the critics have aid about this movie and to be completely hones; screw em'! Critics never know a good horror movie even if it came an bite them in the ass, literally. They have always looked down upon great horror movies and what do they know?! 3 decades ago when the original Friday the 13th came out, it got horrible reviews and look at it now; it's a cultural classic!

397,Radu_Vladislas,"Killer, intruder, homicidal man. If you see me coming run as fast as you can.",8,3 July 2009,"This movie has some good moments in it and one or two moments that were just over done. The atmosphere in it was decent enough for a modern day horror movie. And in saying that though it wasn't as creepy as the earlier movies in the series (the first seven). Mind you no Hollywood movie nowadays can come close to the eighties horror movie atmosphere. And no amount of money or movie making talent will change that fact.Amanda Righetti (Whitney Miller) is a honey so she is. She's great And I wont hear a negative word towards her. When I saw her character get killed by Jason at the start I was shocked. I was sitting there thinking to myself ""You bastards. You have gone and killed my beloved Amanda!"". That was a drop in morale for me that moment. What shocked me most of all was that I remember her getting the locket with JV's mothers picture in it while in the house. And Whitney was supposed to resemble Jason's mother. So you'd think he'd hesitate in killing her if she looked like her right?. So I sat there sulking while watch the movie as I thought Amanda (Whitney) was brown bread (dead). Then during a scene where her brother trips on an alarm Jason had set up to let him know of intruders in the area, the camera then dives into JV's underground base. And what do we see down there? Whitney chained up. So I was like ""YAY!"" and my morale rose. I guess Jason saw the resemblance at the last moment before he inserted the machete into Whitney's face. And from that moment on I was wondering if Amanda (Whitney) would actually get to see the end of the movie without a machete rammed somewhere the sun doesn't shine. And with Jason involved it's anyones guess if she was to survive. Watch the movie people to see if Whitney does make it. I am not telling you. I am just glad she wasn't killed at the start after all. I was excited with what was going on after I found out Whitney survived the initial attack. I started wishing I was there to keep her safe. Sounds daft that doesn't it. Mind you in saying that and at the sight of Jason coming through the trees with a machete and your in his line of sight. The best thing to do is quote Bender from Futurama ""Cheese it!"" and just don't stop running until you reach Alaska.I think the sex scenes were over done in this movie. I don't have a problem with boobs being on show. The showing of boobs is a good thing he he. There are some lovely boobs on show. But the second sex scene in the movie (the one in the bedroom) was long and drawn out. It lasted about twenty or thirty seconds more than it should have. It doesn't matter how fine the woman is in the scene. The scene could have been shortened in length. Next time I watch the movie that scene will be skipped and the same goes for every time after that as well. Fast Forward is the way. Too many sex scenes and long scenes like that spoil this kind of movie. I might be more of a gore hound than a porn hound in saying that though. And if anyone disagree's with my comment about the over use of sex in this movie then go watch some porn, not a slasher movie.The songs used in the movie are not my kind of music. They could have used some Brainstorm songs like (Inside The Monster), (Painside), etc. Songs to rock to (and in Jason's case... songs to kill to).All in all with the negative points and plus points I'd say it was a decent enough movie. I just treated it as another JV (Jason) movie and didn't think of it as a remake too much. It worked. I just hope they don't make any more following this series. And go back and finish off the other Jason movies. The old series needs closure before a re-start is given to the franchise.And by the way Hollywood, do me a favour, cast Amanda Righetti in more movies. She is a good movie star (and a beautiful one at that).",Friday the 13th

The teens were actually slightly interesting, the deaths were gruesome, and the action was pretty intense. Then, the pretty people came. The SUV pulls up and the cast of the Hills (plus token Asian and African- American guys) get out. From this point forward, the film becomes a typically bland remake.

399,KillingJoker,Guideline for Friday the 13th (2009),7,19 March 2009,"I see a lot of votes on here towards the low and yes those are good scores if you are looking at nothing but the production. Still you have to remember why we go to see slasher horror films in the first place (of course those that are fans of the genre), we go for the kills. Creativity, effectiveness, realism, etc of the kills really is the reason for fans to watch the slasher stuff. I am a fan, I have all the Friday the 13th's, all the nightmare on elm st.'s, Halloween's, etc etc. I've seen them all and after time of thinking about it, its all about how the villain is developed. So this is my idea of a review.1. The Story: Teenagers simply having a party weekend at a cabin (yes very typical, what slasher film doesn't) but the addition of Clay Miller's (played by Jared Padalecki) story trying to find his sister after she goes ""missing"" sometime before at Crystal Lake. Of course put the main guy with the teenagers and you have a common ground for a simple plot.Review of Story: OK yes it is simple like I said but I do like the character of Clay Miller, it gives the story something different that hasn't been used before in the series.2. Jason Voorhees: Derek Mears takes the reigns as the masked killer in this adaptation, hes human just like the first 4 in the series.Review of Jason: I really like Derek Mears in the role, he played it off so well that I want him to return for it if they do another. Even though I'm more of a fan of the undead Jason from 6, 7, 8, Hell, X, and FVJ, it was surprising that I would be such a fan of him being alive in this version. Its worth seeing for him and what he can do but I'm not going to spoil anything.3. Review of the Kills: They were very innovative at some points and one really shocked me because I didn't expect it to happen based on older films, which happens at the long opening of the movie but sometimes they were kind of basic in the approach and effectiveness as the movie progressed but overall it was good.FINAL OVERVIEW: Overall the movie was good in my eyes, you can't look at this like a remake, it is an adaptation of the first 4 and does the first 4 justice in keeping with the main story of Jason supposedly drowning as a boy, his mother goes on a rampage killing counselors (only brief in the opening), Jason returning with a simple cloth for a mask (reflection of part 2), and finally getting the mask (part 3 and so on).",Friday the 13th
400,abbychick41,"Watch it for yourself, Its your own opinion that counts",7,7 March 2009,"I'm not a big fan of the Jason movies, actually I'm not a fan @ all because I've never even seen the past movies. When one of my friends told me about Friday the 13th he told me it wasn't all bad, some parts were funny and overall it was good. I wanted to see it for myself to see if I will enjoy it and surprisingly enough I did. I now want to see the other Jason Films made in the past! My friend also brought out an interesting point about the scenes with the weed plants. Every time, or most of the time, when somebody is near the weed plants Jason comes into view and he just slaughters the victim, like he's protecting his property, protecting his weed, I found that quite true myself. There's some scenes with full frontal nudity, not sure why they decided to bring that into the movie, to me I found it quite unnecessary. The cast was great, they gave it their all, but some scenes they could have done better but their acting was believable. Danielle Panabaker was really great in her role, she didn't go to the extremes with nude scenes, I am glad she didn't do any of those scenes, and hope she never does in the future because she's a really good actress and she knows better. I hope to see her in more films, amazing to find her out of her Disney roles, She's going to go big one day, I can feel it. I was scared at some points, the movie theater started getting warm but it was probably just me freaking out lol. If you want to get scared watch Friday the 13th, and if you're somebody who listens to what people say about a movie you can listen to them and all but it will be even better if you watch the movie for yourself, bring upon your own judgment about it, if you hate the movie, regret you saw it, it's not the end of the world and if you enjoyed it, congratulations!",Friday the 13th
401,stephenjamesb-1,A fresh take on the original series..,9,1 March 2009,"I have been a long time Friday the 13th fan, and when I heard that they were doing a ""remake"" of the original film, I had to wonder if this was going to be actually GOOD.. Despite some flaws in the film, overall I was very happy with the outcome of the film..Knowing that this is the first Friday THE 13TH film in over 20 years it was nice to see the links to the roots of the series.. It's nice to finally see them doing justice to the series and not make it some watered down excuse for a horror film that seems to be the norm in Hollywood these days.. If they had done this then we would have gotten some PG-13 teen friendly crap that people in their 20's and 30's would have despised.. Friday the 13th has always been a slasher film and this is exactly what we were blessed with..They didn't go away from its roots, change it to Saw and Hostel and make this torture porn, it would have been a massive mistake and would have not been true to the spirit of the series..The only difference between the new film and the old is how Jason was handled, we get a smarter, more sadistic Jason..A worthy addition to the Friday universe..",Friday the 13th
402,westcrow2002,Eh ... the Friday the 13th remake was OK.,6,13 February 2009,"To be fair, Friday the 13th was somewhat entertaining. The film recreated and reinvented classic scenes from the original Friday the 13th movies such as the beheading of Jason's mother, Jason hiding his mother's head in his home, the red farmhouse, Jason finding and putting on the hockey mask and there's a little something at the end of the movie that is reminiscent of the end of the first movie. I won't tell you what that is though. Jason (played by Derek Mears) was more frightening than the previous incarnations. The deaths in the movie were the most gruesome I've seen in the franchise thus far. There is one scene that sticks to mind that I loved. One of the teen campers runs into one of those bear traps which look like metal jaws. He steps in it and it literally rips the flesh from his bones. Jared Padalecki did a great job as Clay Miller. In my opinion he stole the movie with his performance. I could have done without the stupid teen campers though. There were two sets of them and I disliked them both. They actually dragged most of the movie down. It wasn't until Clay (Jared) found his sister (Amanda Righetti) and they started running/fighting for their lives against Jason. I will say that if I were to choose between My Bloody Valentine 3D with Jensen Ackles and Friday the 13th, I'd have to go with My Bloody Valentine 3D. Sorry but that's just the way I feel. If you disagree please feel free to comment.",Friday the 13th
403,drummerboyy123,"In every way better than the original, the best horror remake yet",10,13 February 2009,"First off, i knew this movie would be good, but not as good as it actually was. It is simply one of the best horror films i have ever seen. The acting is great, they act like real college kids and not those fake kids you see in other movies. It takes the first four films and combines them to make this amazing piece of film. Jason is much different in this than the others in that he runs and doesn't just pop up out of no where. There's enough jokes and nudity to keep teenagers entertained, and more than enough blood and gore. The first one was a great movie but the remake surpasses it greatly. Probably is, the best horror remake yet. Ill probably see it a second time. Go see it. 10/10",Friday the 13th
404,murnank,Friday the 13th...ON STEROIDS,10,17 February 2009,"Hyper is a word I would use to describe myself in the days leading up to this re-launch of the ""Friday the 13th"" series. Back in 82 my parents let me watch the original. I was only seven years old. I'm sure that alone was a case ripe for a children's social worker but I digress. I grew up on a nutritional diet of ""Friday the 13th"", ""Halloween"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies as well as every other Zombie, Slasher, Possession film I could get my hands on. You name it I've seen it. So to say I was hyper going into this movie is probably somewhat of an understatement. To say I was elated upon leaving is definitely an understatement. It surpassed my expectations in every way. I had fears that this re-launch might just bury the series closer to hell. Many things didn't sit comfortable with me leading up to its release. Some of these included the screenplay being written by the two guys behind Freddy VS Jason, Damien Shannon and Mark Swift. Although it was an enjoyable movie it played too much like a ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" sequel and I wondered if these guys knew how to make a straight ""Friday the 13th"" movie. Next was the replacement of composer Harry Manfredini with Steve Jablonski. Would the movie lose its trademark ""Ki Ki Ki Ma Ma Ma"" echo effect? Most importantly was bringing on Marcus Nispel as director. I really enjoyed his take on ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" in 03. To me it was clearly the master of the remakes. It was Gritty, terrifying and suspenseful but could he make a ""Friday the 13th"" movie that wouldn't play like a carbon copy of his ""TCM"". As I said above the ""TCM"" remake WAS the master of the remakes ""Friday the 13th"" 2009 IS the new master. We all know the story by now. 1980. Psychotic Mother slaughters camp counsellors in an act of revenge for the accidental drowning of her son Jason. The only surviving counsellor decapitates Mother. Flash forward 29 years later. Five teens visit the area of the original massacre to score reputable marijuana. They disturb Jason who never actually drowned but has survived in the wilderness alone like an animal. Jason slaughters most of them very quickly in extremely violent ways. Six weeks later some more teens are visiting their friend's country home in the same area. They cross paths with a guy who's Sister went missing in the area six weeks earlier. Same guy while searching for his Sister disturbs Jason lair and inadvertently leads him back to the other teen's holiday home where mayhem ensues. Same old tried and true slasher formula but this time the formula is on steroids. Jason is a nuclear power in this movie. He's fast, intelligent, savage and scary. I must say the first twenty minutes of the film are definitely the best. This is where we see Jason's most animalistic, violent nature and the audience I watched this with were left speechless. The move drops somewhat in tension and then plays out for the next 50 minutes or so like a classic ""Friday"" movie of old but once it reaches its third act it powers forward again to its edgy climax. Marcus Nispels Direction is solid. He knows how to play with the audience and he doesn't withhold on brutality. He doesn't over-do it either. A handful of powerfully violent kills are more effective than a heap of them. He uses the edge of the frame in some scenes that make it look like Carpenter has directed and his timing of the movies jump scares are next to perfection. The performances are above par for this type of movie but particular mention must go to Amanda Righetti as ""Whitney"". She's the best final girl since ""Ginny"" from part 2 and her energy in the role is infectious. Good mention must go to Jared Padalecki as ""Clay"" and Danielle Panabaker as ""Jenna"" however major kudos to Derek Mears as Jason. He doesn't just take Jason to a whole new dimension; he makes Jason feel like he's alive in IMAX 3D. The score by Steve Jablonsky is also worth mentioning. At times it felt like John Carpenter had scored the movie and to me it really energised the chase scenes. Plus the use of the original ""Ki Ki Ki Ma Ma Ma"" is saved for crucial moments where is underlines the action on screen very well. Jablonsky has also given the movie a haunting lullaby theme that's akin to the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" theme. I hope this returns in the planned sequel. To conclude, ""Friday the 13th"" 2009 has managed to return this series to its darkest roots and I believe this is only the beginning of something really incredible.",Friday the 13th
405,All-the-names-I-chose-were-taken,This movie was really good,9,19 February 2021,"I loved this movie so much, I cant really see why people hate it to be honest. It has a good cast and some good kills, I do recommend watching it",Friday the 13th
406,nfxstudios,Well.... Executed?,6,14 February 2009,"I had a hard time deciding just how good or bad a movie this one is, not because I was unsure of my reaction (I enjoyed it), but because I wasn't really sure what to compare it to.Friday the 13th movies have always been a sort of guilty pleasure among the slasher breed. On one hand, you have Halloween, which had a very tight script, excellent direction and pacing with honest to god suspense, and no point whatsoever. On the other hand, you have The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which was low on production value, gritty, exploitive horror violence in it's most primal and artistic form, and no point whatsoever. Neither of these movies had any value from a plot or character development perspective, but they were primal in nature, expertly crafted by filmmakers at the top of their game, and struck a very strong chord that made them bona fide classics of the genre.And then there was Friday the 13th. The stalker aspects of Halloween combined with the brutality and grittiness of Texas Chainsaw, with possibly less of a point than either film, on their own storytelling merits. Since this movie is intended as an amalgamation of the first 4 Friday the 14th movies, it should be noted that the stalker element was heavy in those films. The formula involves a lot of POV and shots of the killer's feet, until the momentum towards the end chase. In later F13 movies, Jason was no big secret, and he was seen full-body from the get go. It's the same way here, and although this is a redux of the first 4 Friday movies, we lose much of the stalker POV aspect that made Jason kind of a ghost in the woods, and are given a Jason that is a huge, violent, brutal, *motivated* ambush killer.I suppose it's worth noting that so many of the kills in the original Friday series involved Jason walking into frame, the victim cowering, defenseless, Jason sticking a sharp implement into the victim, and walking off screen. It wasn't really until Kane Hodder took over the role that there was any, for lack of a better concept, character development or emotion from Jason. Here, he's PO'd from the get-go, and there's no victim cowering in a corner just waiting to die on cue. Jason comes and gets them, brutally, and there's no sense that the victim is being killed because the script wants them to, but because *Jason* wants them to. I suppose that's a positive point.Production value is another point. The original Texas Chainsaw was gritty and hand-held and looked like it could be an actual snuff film. That was part of its power. The remake managed to increase the production value without losing too much of the grittiness of the original. That was a positive point for that film, and one of the things I really liked about it. Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween, on the other hand, somehow managed to have less production value than the cheaper original, as well as some arguably unnecessary core character changes, and was worse for it. The new Friday the 13th, if anything, might have *too* much production value on the screen for its own good. It's not quite dark and gritty enough.On the other hand, it's been arguably 25 years since we've had a ""serious"" Jason-in-the-woods movie. Ignoring the New Beginning, Jason Lives and the later films played Jason up as an anti-hero and developed the formula into a comic book aspect with a ""gimmick"" for each film... the resurrections by lightning, the telekenisis, the toxic sludge, the demon worm, outer space, dueling with Freddy. So its been a long time coming that we have a back to the roots story of Jason running amok in the woods without a campy gimmick to make him the protagonist of the story instead of the villain. Here, he's definitely the villain and, like the movie itself, he means business.What we have, in the end, is probably the best Friday the 13th movie ever made. But, that's not really saying much, since the originals weren't very good to begin with (although definitely my favorite guilty pleasure as far as horror goes). Friday the 13th 2009 looks a little too slick and is missing some of the ghost-in-the-woods stalker aspects that worked in the originals, but the new Jason is definitely very menacing. You don't get the sense that he can only catch you by teleporting or because the script says you have to fall down. He's coming to get you, and he's going to do something awful to you. Would-be victims fight back and are beaten down viciously. One rips the sack off his head and is stunned by Jason's deformations. Among the clutter of the attic setting is an old hockey mask. The ending, with Jason bursting up through the dock, is pure, classic Friday the 13th. And it has absolutely no point, whatsoever.So what we're left with is a brutal slasher film that's light on literary credit, a little too heavy on production values, but which pays due respects to the source material to be recognizable beyond the hockey mask and machete. A handful of the characters are either likable, memorable, or get under your skin. None of them is dynamic in any way. The plot is formulatic. Yeah, it's a Friday the 13th movie, and a pretty good one, as those things go. *Slightly* above average 6/10, with high hopes for a solid sequel next year that doesn't try to cram 4 movies worth of backstory into one script.",Friday the 13th
407,Brandonhanna,Time to start over,10,19 February 2009,"This what fans have been waiting for. After Jason Goes To Hell, Jason X, and Freddy Vs Jason we finally got good old Jason back. Don't get me wrong I loved Jason X and F VS J, but it was nice seeing Jason do what he does. Being a fan since the early 80's I was a bit nervous about seeing a ""remake"" but I went in with an open mind knowing they were focusing on the 1st four films I thought it all came together really well. I have read comments about Jason walking, but remember Jason didn't walk til 6 ""Jason Lives"" when he actually rose from the grave. He was pretty fast in 3 and 4, a little over weight too. Anyway, great movie I am sure number 13 or part 2 however they will do it is already in the works.",Friday the 13th
408,mvandeneede,I was not Disappointed,8,13 February 2009,"As was stated in many others' comments; The first 15-20 minutes start off with fierce violence and bloodshed. Loved it... Then stagnant for about twenty or so more minutes while you were introduced to the next set of Jason's victims.My favorite points about this remake is that Michael Bay stuck with the original Jason mentality. Jason never left Crystal Lake (not in space, in new york, etc.) he cherished his mother and still would hallucinate that he sees his mother if someone uses something from her like the sweater in Friday the 13th II. Amanda Righetti did very well as the damsel... damn good thing she kept that locket or she would have been hung by the fire! I liked that when Jason stalked his victims, he was just as sneaky, but would pursue them by sprinting... the original Jason never ran...only walked and would reappear. This Jason is definitely more of a realistic homicidal maniac.Bravo Zulu again Mr. Bay",Friday the 13th
409,artrambler-ru_96,Welcome to Crystal Lake,10,12 June 2011,"Everything started in 2003 when director Marcus Nispel remake shot at ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" It turned out much better than the original and so many directors and producers take the example of Marcus. And since then the fashion for remakes. On Halloween, Fellow, Horror Amitivilya and others have already filmed remakes. And of course just for the money, nor for the sake of art. Now, for the cause took Marcus Nispel, and he set a goal off a remake of the classics horrors ""Friday 13"". The plot remake lay storyline of the first three parts of the original. That benefited from this remake. Jason has become a more powerful, faster and much smarter. Why is smarter? Stupid maniac did not put the traps in his lair (as Jigsaw). In addition, early in the film Jason has not killed the girl, he took her to his lair, because it reminded him of his mother, and he decided to temporarily save her life. On the other plus I probably will not speak, because it is better to see and appreciate. Horror fans should enjoy. Elegant classic horror film about a maniac. The film pays tribute to the classics, which we love. It's a shame that the extensions will not, but since the end of the film hinted at a sequel.",Friday the 13th
410,SLASHerMan,Get out your popcorn,7,21 February 2009,"After much anticipation, this take on Friday the 13th maintains all the elements we've come to expect, but feels a lot different than any classic Friday-film. Fortunately enough, it was a fun experience to see it on the big screen.After New Line's last three attempts to use the Jason Voorhees character in new and special situations, the films have fallen into mediocrity, and become even more gimmicky then they were back in the 80's. So time for something different. And this isn't quite the dark, menacing ultra-violent throwback, but it's more like the lighter Friday installments, especially Jason Lives comes to mind. It's a Friday-movie by all means, and Jason does vicious things, but between the carnage are some wonderfully stupid (and even somewhat heartfelt) characters, making up a nice ensemble of enjoyable and somewhat stereotypical people. What makes it work is that they don't make fun of Jason.Derek Mears is to Jason what Daniel Craig is to Bond - he's the character we know, and he delivers on all the goods we've come to see, but he goes about it in different ways, and has a fresher take on a classic character. Just see it with an open mind, and don't go in to this expecting ""Sean Connery"", or you'll be disappointed.Jason's new motivation makes the story somewhat new and unique, and that's where fans will probably divide. If you feel as though you know and expect certain things from the character, you have to sort of put it aside. But I just feel that this new incarnation is what makes the film work overall - he's after all logical and fully based in reality, and isn't that better than some undead rotting corpse? There are certain characters I could do without (or I'd gladly recast), and a few glitches in storytelling here and there, but when it all comes down to it, Friday the 13th is all about a fun experience. It's not brain surgery folks, and this is not Academy Award-winning material. Just have fun with it, because every film is going to treat the same premise in a different way.The unrated cut might resolve a few things, or even add more tone, but for now, Friday the 13th is just a fun and predictable thing, or as someone once so well put it - comfort food, the Big Mac of horror. So have fun with it while it lasts.",Friday the 13th
411,sirseef,Drowned by Hollywood,3,27 September 2009,"More of a remake of Friday the 13th 2, this remake is another bland and bogus attempt to modernize a horror classic (even when the original wasn't that great). Friday the 13th (2009) has much in common with the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake in that it's stripped of all the best and unique parts, atmosphere, and cinematography, and replaced with cookie-cutter scenes that couldn't be distinguished from one horror remake to the other. Of course slasher films are gonna have similar deaths and that's fine. The problem is the lack of style in which it is done. There's no creepy cabin-in-the-woods feel, there's no mystery, there's no spooky shots or suspense, it's all action/horror. It's as if these remakes were all shot with the same writers, directors, cinematographers, art directors, etc. and maybe they were, I really don't care to investigate (though I did see Michael Bays stamp on this one so it doesn't surprise me).If you can withstand these complaints, there's also the lame characters who you'll grow to hate along with their lame jokes and one-liners. I did give this movie 3 stars for a reason though. Not because anything good is going on, but because it was a pleasure to see some of the annoying characters fall victim to Jason's comically large machete, and because I've seen worse. Namely Zombie's Halloween.There have been few well-styled horror films released in theaters lately and this one is no exception. However, if you're a young, casual horror and action movie fan who simply wants to jump a few times in their seat, disregard what I've said as I'm sure you will anyway and have a watch - it's not the worst thing ever - just a disgrace to true horror fans. Deserving of a bad review, this Hollywood action horror is only in it for the cash.",Friday the 13th

If you watched the old Friday the 13th movies to poke fun at them, then you'll probably get a good chuckle out of this.The funniest part of the film is that they tried to make it scary, but it wasn't. Just a bunch of cheap scares really. There really isn't anything creative about the movie, it's just teenagers having sex and dying which, if you like Friday the 13th, should be no surprise.There's no way to spoil this movie. It is exactly the same as the other ones and I truly find it funny that they tried to make it good. Plus, if you don't laugh during the movie, you have no sense of humor.",Friday the 13th
413,doctorgonzo64,Friday the 13th VS My Bloody Valentine,7,14 February 2009,"I had just seen the My Bloody Valentine remake a week before I went to see Friday the 13th, and I think that it's good to compare the films, since they have so many obvious similarities. If you've seen, or are planning on seeing, both, then you may find this review helpful.The Gore: when it comes to a successful slasher film, good gore is almost always a necessity. In MBV, the gore is almost laughable. Why use CGI blood? I have no f*cking idea. All the killings in MBV are loaded with CGI. When it comes to blood, it just looks too cartoony to take seriously. I was very surprised to see ""real"" fake blood in F13th. The gore in F13th is pretty damn good. It's realistic, scary, and brutally violent. MBV: 2 F13th: 9The Nudity: another necessity to a good slasher film. Okay, not always--but in most cases, some skin in the mix can make quite a difference in a slasher movie. There's nudity in both films. In MBV, we have one scene of nudity--but it's almost ten solid minutes of full frontal female nudity. We also get a second of male rear nudity. This scene is the best in MBV. It's what the entire film could have been: over-the-top and in-your-face. Just like any good slasher film. In F13th, we have breast nudity from almost every woman in the cast. No male nudity that I recall. When it comes to nudity, F13th stays true to its roots, and MBV goes all out. At least for ten minutes. MBV: 7 F13th: 7The Style: for slashers, gore and skin are usually important. There have been a few exceptions. Sleepaway Camp (which I think is the greatest slasher film of all time) has a pretty general lack of both. So we can lump the rest of the qualities of these two films (which aren't generally outstanding slashers) under Style. The acting in MBV is another laughably bad trait of the film. I don't think the main character is as tough as the director would have us believe. In fact, if it wasn't for his frat-boy-on-horse-steroids voice, there wouldn't be one person in the audience who wouldn't believe that every other dude in this movie could pop that pussy's head off like a grape. MBV takes place in an alternate universe where miners and police officers live in $500,000 homes and everyone looks like underwear models. The story in MBV is pretty terrible too. MBV is pretty much a soap opera with blood and tits. The film is as slick as anything else coming out of Hollywood nowadays, but the 3D technology here was actually a little disappointing. This is the worst RealD film I've seen, technology-wise. Journey to the Center of the Earth was, of course, worse on every other level. F13th is also slick. It's actually slicker. This is as expensive and heavily produced a slasher film as possible. But the Hollywood approach still works in F13th. The film is pretty dark, visually, which is also true to its roots. The acting is a little sub-par, and the cast is made up of Beautiful People. The cinematography in both films is pretty straightforward, though in F13th the lighting and occasional filtering does much to add to the atmosphere. MBV: 1 F13th: 7Friday the 13th is the best slasher film you are going to see come out of this generation. A classic it is not. My Bloody Valentine is boring, ugly, and annoying. It is an insult to the original film, which was original in more than one sense of the word.Finally: My Bloody Valentine: 3.5 Friday the 13th: 7.5",Friday the 13th
414,Vorhees1996,Nope,2,7 April 2019,As a fan of the original movies this was doesn't make sense to me. I get that people want to make a reboot but come one. Jason all of a sudden has some underground layer and holds a person captive? No just doesn't make sense. Jason isn't smart enough for that.,Friday the 13th
415,jakeben,Doesn't touch the magic of the original,5,3 February 2020,First of all this remake is a poor attempt to capture the magic of the original film. It doesn't even come close especially where the characters are concerned. The death scenes are fantastically done and Jason looks great in the film it all looks great but that's as much as it has going for it. The characters are hollow and quite one dimensional. Dialogue is corny and cliched. Nothing touches the original Friday the 13th and part 6 is also much better than this reboot.,Friday the 13th
416,Voklova,A lackluster reboot that is bittersweet,6,14 May 2020,"This film unfortunately does not bring any new or interesting narrative within the Friday the 13th film series. It may squeeze more scares or entertainment value to younger or newer audiences who've probably never seen any of the films prior, but to anyone who's at least seen the first few will understand what I am getting at. Like most of the the films in the series, this film shows very little to no originality in it's set up. Hormone filled teenagers embark on a getaway to or near Camp Crystal Lake, they soon encounter Jason Vorhees, some get killed, some get chased a bit and then boom queue the end where any lucky survivors are rescued and Jason meets whatever fate is put upon him. This not only makes this film seem more like a pointless money-grabber, but it's lack of distinguishable traits make it a more forgettable film to most. The lack of creativity in both plot build up, character archetypes and deaths sadly take away from the film's experience.The film does have a good side to it though that saves it from being completely unwatchable. Firstly, the acting is pretty well done, the cast did a good job at portraying their assigned characters to the best of their abilities so cudos to them. The cinematography was very well on point which I felt was one of the major reasons why they chose to reboot the series in the first place. The improved graphics and special effects are a major update to the primitive techniques used in the early films. The use of throwbacks and references from earlier films all mashed together into this reboot was also an interesting component as in a way it allows for newer audiences to get a rough gist of all the previous films in this one movie without having to go back and watch every one. Combine that with the well shot scenes and acting, the film succeeds at reintroducing the iconic story of Jason Vorhees to modern audiences.But like mentioned earlier, although the references will humour die hard fans and the newer update in filming will fill newer audiences in on what they have missed, the lack of any new substance or detail just makes this film feel bland and boring. Though entertaining, this film can either please or disappoint anyone who watches it.",Friday the 13th
417,raycja89,Whoa...,10,17 February 2009,"My title pretty much sums up what I feel when I recall this movie. It was surely unlike any other horror movie re-make, sorry, RE-ENVISIONING I've encountered in a LONG LONG time. The cheap scares were bumped up, the gore was definitely there, and the sex...well, it wouldn't be a ""Friday the 13th"" movie without the sex. As for Jason's new ""attitude"" if you really wanna call it that, it's a huge plus in my book. He's more bad ass, he's more ruthless and he's definitely more imaginative with his killing 'methods'. I went in expecting another night of jumps and scares, and got just that plus the satisfaction of knowing a classic horror movie icon was finally re-done correctly. Although I hate talking' about scenes in a movie, I have to say that having Jason stick a camper in a sleeping bag and hang them over a roaring fire while they scream for their lives at the top of their lungs...it's a hugely big improvement from his usual hack and slash from his roots, needless to say there is a lot of 2009 showing in this Jason installment.In final words of advice, I must say catch this while it's still in theaters because in my opinion it's well worth shelling over the cash, not once but twice.",Friday the 13th
418,okieforever,insulting and tired,2,28 February 2009,"Everything that made the originals so enjoyable has been sucked out of this soulless remake/reboot/retread/ridiculous. Where were the creative kills? Where were the scary thrills? Everyone is coming down on the fact that Jason runs in this one, but I think that aspect is fine. Why not spice it up a bit? The lumbering killer was fine for the Cold War 80s, but we're in the 21st Century now.The first 10 minutes was only slightly bearable, then it just got really really really boring. I'm so disappointed. I hope they either learn from this horrible mistake and not screw up the Elm Street franchise, or just give it all up altogether and be happy with the originals.",Friday the 13th
419,escalade94,Jason is back and better than ever before!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,20 June 2009,"Okay, we can all admit that this movie could have been a bit better, but only a tiny bit. Compared to the crappy bad acting and stupid story plots that we've seen from the previous Friday the 13th films, this was stupendous! The acting was pretty good except for that girl Bree. She didn't have a big roll, but I think she was probably just a porn star that was given an opportunity to star in this. IDk...maybe I'm just thinking that. This story had a pretty good plot. It wasn't very original, but still pretty good. I loved how they put the ending of the original first movie in the opening credits. That was pretty good! Another thing I loved about this movie was that it had smart characters. I am sick of seeing horror films where the characters could easily escape, but are stupid and end up dying! Especially My Bloody Valentine. I hated that movie more than any other movie (besides Sharkboy and Lavagirl). Freddy vs. Jason was also horrible. I remember that I wanted to see that movie so much when I was a kid, but when I finally saw it, I felt stupid. The acting, writing, and almost everything else about it was bad. The Freddy vs. Jason plot wasn't that bad, but they really screwed up the smaller details and definitely the acting!!! I swear they found hobos off the street and let them be in the movie. The only negative that really stood out to me in this new movie was the whole mine thing. I mean, does Jason really need to have an underground ""lair""? I liked how they made him smarter (running, setting traps, etc), but I think they went a little too far with the mine thing. I also was wondering how they were underground and then came above the ground through a bus. ??? Well, IDk, but I do know that I love this movie and cannot wait to watch on my flat screen TV downstairs and not up locked in my room with my little 20"" TV. My dad is completely against me seeing this and doesn't know that I bought it. Shhhhhh...but my mom is semi-fine with it. GO MOM!!! My dad is going on a business trip to Michigan next week, so I'll be able to watch this beautiful flick on a larger TV and with the volume higher than 2.Sorry about this ranting, but I just love this movie. I highly recommend it to not only the old F13 fans, but also new people who are into the slasher genre. It will be a relief if you just saw My Bloody Valentine!!! Hahahaha!!! See ya!!!!",Friday the 13th

Bree, Clay, Chelsea, Nolan, and Trent are my favourite characters. The reason I like the movie is that the deaths are so cool and I think people are really impressed.I hope everyone liked this movie. I and my sister really like this movie and I think some people i know will really like this movie. Jason is just so cool and how he just acts is so like awesome. Of course I should not tell the surprise ending but if i did you will know the ending. This movie will always be my favourite horror movie.

Some friends go together to the woods, they use drugs, have sex and blah, blah... someone disappear, the others go search separately and then some reject by the society appears and start the killing. OK... but this one it's a remake of all teenagers-horror-movies with a comic vein.Jason or Leatherface? I think Marcus Nispel was confused about what movie he was directing. It only lacked a chainsaw on Jason's hands.All the deaths were completely predictable and completely funny. The movie doesn't show us Jason's teleport machine, because he's everywhere, every time. We don't receive an explanation about the history of Jason, the way that he grew or how he became so skillful. I hope they don't make a 'Friday the 13th - The Beginning' like they did with Texas Chainsaw Massacre. What a mess. Jason didn't deserve it. This movie is a joke, seriously.",Friday the 13th
422,merlinlake78,A new take on a classic.,1,13 November 2010,"So, The actor ""Jared Padalecki"" is very good at shouting 'what the f*ck!!' whenever the moment sees fit, Arlen Escarpeta is very good at playing this obnoxious shallow adolescent, And the girls are sorely there for the occasional nudity and a few scream and shouts here and there. And..Well thats basically it, As far as the acting is concerned. It doesn't bring this movie too any higher level. But do you really watch this kind of movie for its story or interesting dialogue? No. You pressed play for just one thing. And that too watch mister Voorhees butchering them one by one, By any means necessary. And he does, With his trusty machete or perhaps some tools from the shed. In one scene he finds his trademark mask, And becomes this icon we all love (or hate). To me, Jason Voorhees is the hero of this movie. He sets the record straight and isn't some to mess with. Never shy of a second kill. Im not particularly fond of remakes, Because you'll never capture that same magic of the original one. But this one is OK. its worth a trip to the videostore.",Friday the 13th
423,chrisjakubowski,Such a huge disappointment,5,20 October 2019,"Wow. Where do I start. Roughly 30 minutes into the movie it hits you. You felt it from the start but wasn't sure what it was. There was something not right about the movie. Besides the standard set up and generic directing. There is absolutely no reason behind anything. Characters do things because the script tells them. One scene just precedes the next. It's just there. Move is super boring.
Jason is this super powered guy. He seems to have super strength and ability to charge down like a bull on speed. You're left just bored and disinterested. If you like the very standard for the time slashers then you will probably enjoy it. For me it's a massive disappointment.",Friday the 13th
424,jkampschneider,Friday the 13th is back.,7,23 December 2009,"I have only seen the first Friday the 13th, and was very disappointed. What killer is a woman. Anywho, I have never been a die-hard fan of F13, but I thought I would give this one a try. With my expectations low, I walked into the movie. I really liked the opening sequence, where the first group of campers come in and are terrorized. I also think the new twist of Jason keeping a hostage was interesting. There were 2 OBVIOUS cons in this movie: 1. The gigantic amount of sex. I don't mind a sex scene or two, but this went WAY overboard. 2. I really thought that Jenna or that Panabaker girl shouldn't have died. She was important to the movie, and she was HOT.Jason was played well in my opinion. He was creepy and distorted, and it was actually pretty exciting when his mask gets ripped off. I, personally, was sweating by the time the movie was over. I jumped at several appearances of Jason. I thought the ending was very clever. Another con about this movie: The characters were so poorly put together. We were hardly even introduced to a couple of the characters when the deaths began.Overall: Scary/too much sex Can't wait for the Next One.7/10",Friday the 13th

426,Zombeefan,Anyone actually enjoy this clichéd ridden pile of garbage?,4,13 May 2010,"Out of the glutton of franchise remakes, Friday The 13th ranks as the second worst remake of the lot. The only films worse than this would be Rob Zombie's Halloween remake.So they take a successful formula that worked since F13 Part 6, and change it up to turn Jason into a militant pot farmer trying to protect his crops, while he hops skips and jumps around killing teenagers on vacation at Camp Crystal Lake.Seriously did the filmmakers think it was a great idea to shove the first 3 original F13 films into one remake? Doing so ended up jarring the entire story to a stop because you are so caught up in the confusion of these moments that your brain is on overload by the time it settles into one coherent storyline, then they mess it up even more by introducing and killing off the token characters that film every cliché in the book. If you are going to fill your film with clichés then do it right, and the best film to pull of every horror cliché was Freddy Vs. Jason. Now that is a film that properly pays respects and correctly executes the over the top clichés we all know, love and point out at a moments notice, but in F13 (2009) when the clichés start coming at you one right after another and are executed as hazardously as they are... you just sit down in your seat and sink further trying to cover your eyes and kicking yourself for wasting the money and time to see this travesty of a film.Seriously this new breed of horror remakes are not helping the genre, they are killing it, and the only thing is they aren't even doing it with any pizazz or style.",Friday the 13th
427,forty_7,Terrible. Absolutely terrible.,1,15 February 2009,"Lots and lots of spoilers below.First of all, let me be clear and say that I have not seen the original ""Friday the 13th"" in over 10 years. It isn't a movie that stayed with me in any way - I've always been a fan of Halloween / Michael Meyers. That said, I think I know what makes a good horror film, and I know that none of those things are in this film.My first complaint lies in the structure of the story. The first thirty minutes or so of prologue lend nothing but confusion as to where the story is going. When we find out after the first group of murders who has been kept alive and how they are connected to the second story line (Clay's search for his sister), I had spent so much time being repulsed by the group of friends that I really had no emotional stake (re: I couldn't even remember the character's name) in whether the girl lived or died. My second complaint lies with I expect that there will be the obtuse sex, drinking, and drugs in any ""campy"" horror film like this, but these first 30 minutes were so packed with inane boobs and weed shots that I was ready to consider this a comedy, not a horror film. I'm not looking for social commentary when I see a slasher film, but all of the references to marijuana seem like they're being made by people who have never even come in contact with it. It's almost like when you're in High School, bragging about how high you got, and the guy you're talking to lies so that he doesn't feel stupid for not partaking in substances like that: ""Man, I got SOOOOoooo freaking high last night. What'd you do at the party?"" ""Oh, uhm, I smoked several weed cigarettes and drank a couple brewskis, then passed out."" Apparently, this guy wrote a screenplay for a Friday the 13th ""remake"".Lastly, although I could probably keep complaining about this film, Jason is absolutely NOT SCARY in the first half of this movie. By the time we're midway through the second story line (I contend that this movie should have been called: ""Friday the 13th: A Bunch of Douche Bags Go Camping, and Jason Voorhees Is Somewhat Involved"") there have been so many crappy people on-screen, and they have been killed by Jason in typical Jason style, he just isn't that scary anymore. We know he's there, waiting for the topless girl with fake boobs to swim ashore so he can decapitate her. WE KNOW. This film is neither atmospheric, nor does it even attempt to build tension. It is simply a terrible movie.Other grievances: The pot-dealing redneck, who is only introduced so that he can be killed and Jason can find his hockey mask (a full HOUR into the film), is the single most disgusting character I've ever seen on-screen. This is not a compliment: just before his ""untimely"" demise, he talks to a mannequin, and asks the mannequin if she ""remembers that night, when (she) took (his) virginity"". I would rather be decapitated by Jason than ever hear those words spoken in a film again.Why is it that every Michael Bay production or direction has to include the blue halo / lens flare around electric lights? I noticed this early on, but at one point later in the film, as a flashlight goes across the screen, there is actually a sound effect applied when the lens flare hits the audience. WHY? How much money did you spend on that? How much time was spent adding that tiny ""swoosh"" into the soundtrack? God, Michael, get a freaking life - you can't just add things like that and hope that you've produced a good film. You haven't. And you never will.",Friday the 13th
428,BigDom2786,One of the Best Horror remakes since Dawn of the Dead,8,14 February 2009,"My Friday list goes like this:1. Part 2 2. Friday the 13th 3 Part 4 4. Part 6 5. Part 7 6. Part 3 7. Freddy vs. Jason 8. Part9 10. Jason X 11. Part 8Now for the real point....the review. The movie was the best Friday since Part 4 and the acting was the best I've seen in a Friday flick ( not that it's saying much). Like critics had said it's a greatest hits of the first 4 films. U can see elements of all 4 films in there( certain deaths, Jason's mom, girl that looks like jasons mom, the plot of about the brother finding the sister, but instead of one day and acting like she's been lost for six weeks...it's actually been six weeks). Jason's faster, smarter, better than before. Kane Hodder is probably proud of Jason Mears but before I get to the good stuff lets get to the bad...It's a horror movie right...so somethings have to be given a break compared to others ( like Jason's love of teleportation)but the acting was meh to say the least). like I said it was the best of all Friday flicks but..there were cringe worthy moments( most of the acting in the beginning) and dumb moments( you really had to go to the same cabin 3 times and you know Jason lives there) and questionable dialogue and stereotypes. Jason got really smart compared to last filcks... but there were still some really dumb moments from him also. And any attempts they made on making him human compared the unstoppable killing machine we all know and love. And then there was the TCM feel to it..where some moments felt like leatherface with a hockey mask...but i kinda expected that since it's directed by Marcus Nispel.Now for the good. The pacing was great. People say it felt like a remake then a sequel right after...I never felt that. I felt it was a great beginning ( Friday wise) and leadup to the rest of the film. By the time the title appeared on the screen the audience went wild ( anyone experience that too). Though took off for the acting...it was still one of the best (and probably longest) openings to a movie ever. Derek Mears is Jason...I can't stress that enough. Every other Jason( except Kane Hodder) and suck it. He made them look like chew toys in this movie. If your'e look for slow dumb Jason, don't watch this movie...he's smart and he's relentless. The story was good in my opinion. Though it feels like a more fleshed out version of part 4's brother looking for sister storyline it was pretty decent. Oh to the idiots who think Jason is a pot farmer...it becomes pretty clear he isn't after the kids enter his house. The kills were pretty effective. One in particular that didn't fall into cliché mode made me happy and well as a unexpected one. The leadup at the end for the sequel was OK, though i'm sure that's not what Marcus intended.Overall I'll put the new Friday in the fourth on my list ( and technically third killswise cuz I feel like the first is barely watchable now) and a 7.5/10 overall but based on the scale here I'll lean more towards an 8. If the sequel is about as good as this one...count me in.",Friday the 13th

I have actually seen this Friday the 13th 2009 movie and i have to say it continues from the prev movie with Jason's mother at the start so the story is well written. The acting is well done by most actors and the music and scenery effects are very creepy. the make up effects and Jason's mask is just as original the kills are very gory and original jason just takes no prisoners straight to the point which is exciting to watch.

430,williambertram,Pretty good modernization,6,13 August 2021,"First, for those who are curious, this is not a re-make of the original film. This one appears to take place circa 2009.Next, I'd like to address all the negative reviews. What are people actually expecting from a movie named Friday The 13th? Someone commented, ""it makes the original look like Citizen Kane."" Having just watched them back-to-back (on Friday the 13th) I do not agree with this. The original movie is campy, 80s B-Movie fun, but no more. This is an honest attempt to provide a modern version of the same, and it succeeds. Why would anyone expect something different? That's more of a problem with unrealistic expectations.Acting is FAR better in the 2009 film than in the original. Keep in mind that it's a slasher flick, so the cast doesn't have a lot to work with, but they do a good job considering.The plot doesn't seek to change the formula. Everyone already knows what the movie is about, and what will happen. It's a Jason movie, right? Hockey mask, machete, Crystal Lake, gore and screaming. It gets all that stuff right. There are some good jump scares, tension, and funny kill scenes. The actor playing Jason, while silent, is very creepy and imposing. It's probably harder to pull that off than most people think.This will not win an Oscar or re-define the genre, but if you want a competent throwback slasher flick, it should fit the bill.I highly recommend it if you're looking for a Friday the 13th movie you haven't seen on the day itself, which is when I watched it.",Friday the 13th

434,yabesthomie,Scary? No. Funny? Yes!,7,28 February 2009,"I think the makers of this film forgot who the Star of Friday The 13th is. For a movie about a Psychopathic Killer in a Hockey Mask there sure was a lot of talking. I found myself very happy with this film the first half hour in but then it started! Bluh, Bluh, Bluh, 5 minutes of stalking and killing, rinse and repeat. I use the word 'stalking' loosely. It seemed as though when I started to feel a little suspense the person got killed quick and the scene was over. What happened to the creepy ""Where is he?"" feel and the theme music from some of the other flicks? I'm sorry but I didn't spend 10 bucks to see some horrible actors talking, partying and some kid drinking from a shoe. I couldn't wait for that little annoying goof to meet Ol' Jason. Don't get me wrong, there is some enjoyable scenes! They had some really cool, fresh ideas! Jason running is pretty bad ass and it would have scared the poop out of yours truly if they used it a little more. I don't know... I'm really not a little movie geek that likes to pick on flicks but it just seems like film makers don't know what scary is anymore. Its all about gore and surprise. I laughed at a lot of the kills because they were over so quick. I guess when you grow up watching a series and they remake it you expect things. I think the 17 year old kids that aren't fans of the originals will like this one a lot. It just seemed like a WB version of Friday The 13th to me. I was waiting for Buffy the Jason Slayer to come and kick some ass. But thankfully that didn't happen. Bottom line is, Its worth a watch. Not HORRIBLE but not great. Kinda fun. Kinda boring. For every step forward there were a couple of steps back. My Bloody Valinetine 3D was pretty much the same movie but cooler because of the 3D. We'll see what they can do in the Sequel!

I expected through Friday the 13th 09' to see something new and different, but i was very disappointed for seeing at the beginning of the movie a 5 minutes weak flashback about Jason's past, then after that the usual nude and killing scenes in slasher movies!",Friday the 13th
436,maxyrobin,"Not bad, but could have been better",5,13 February 2009,"I liked this movie... But so far I think is the worst slasher remake by Platinum Dunes; well it isn't even a remake actually, but more like a sequel/remake. Watching this you feel like the producers are telling you: ""Yeah, right... forget about those other eleven Friday the 13th films we made, the original true story continues here.""This movie has all the Friday the 13th clichés and classics: Teenager slashing (which isn't THAT gory, actually), unnecessary nudity (that part is pretty OK) and teen drunk/stunned/horny goofy situations (some of them really hilarious, but that is the idea, in fact), however something is missing. Feels like the plot could have been exploited better, or that the storyline could have been expanded a little... Or that the writers could have really tried to make memorable characters... But no. Not in this one. This is just another old-fashioned-trying-to-look-new ""running meat"" flick. Just the same as always Friday the 13th movie.Don't get me wrong, it deserves a chance and it's worth pop corn, but not much more. If you're a Friday th 13th fan (as myself) you will really appreciate the effort of bringing back the series getting through those awful two last films (parts 9 and 10, Freddy vs Jason is actually fun).

437,epoen08,Did they really think we'd buy Friday 13th as a remake?,5,7 March 2009,"I have a lot of problems with this movie, but I will start with one good thing about this movie that a lot of people frowned on. I was glad to see Jason actually run in this movie, which was half the reason I went to see it. The other half was the fact I was so impressed with Rob Zombie's Halloween, that I thought these people were finally getting horror right this go around. Without dogging all the bad horror movies that I have seen this year, I will get on to the points. 1) Everyone speculated this would be a remake of the original Friday the 13th, and there were some clues that led me to believe that it was supposed to be such as a) the sack over his head prior to the mask b) finding of the mask c) his mother being the killer (at least at the very beginning) but the main thing that baffled me as to the legitimacy of it being a remake? Okay, it starts out showing his mom on April 13th, 1980. BAM! She's dead! Then it says 20 years later. 20 YEARS LATER and Jason is running around with a sack on his head. WHO WAS NOT CONFUSED BY THIS??? 2) I'm sorry, but horror movies with the Supernatural guy just don't work well. Cry_Wolf anyone? 3) Since when does Jason set up bells and lights to let him know someone is in his territory? 4) Since when does Jason take hostages? 5) The only person that I really didn't predict dying 5 minutes prior to the death was the last female in the tunnel. 6) How many times can you hit a guys head on multiple bus windows, shattering them, without getting a scratch? 7) If you report to the police there is a big man carrying around a dead body, when does only one cop (happening to be the same friggin cop you meet earlier in the movie) show up? 9) The wood chipper. The writers were smart enough to use a wood chipper in the movie, but only as a tease. I don't know about you, but I would've ended it there and satisfied the audience. No possibility for a sequel? Even if he had've been shredded in the chipper, he still could've switched bodies or something. He did it in one of the other movies, can't remember which one. 10) Yeah, it was kind of a cool death scene, but what the hell is Jason doing with a bow and arrow?? Don't take the killer out of his habitat, it just doesn't work. Jason uses (mainly) a machete or other sharp objects, not a bow and arrow. Come to think of it, what horror movie ""monster"" has ever used a bow and arrow in a seriously good scary movie? 11) And lastly: (kinda repeating a little here, but...) What writers and directors are forgetting is, all the hype in the world will not make a horror movie work. You don't need so much suspense to the point where the audience can predict who when and pretty much how and where a person will die. You use the element of surprise. The best kills in this movie were the first set! And all this could've been prevented if everyone was honest with the rich OCD guy. I don't think there was one person in that ""cabin"" that even liked the guy. All in all, it was okay for a sequel, but there are far too many problems that can't be (and should not have been) overlooked. People, this was a horrible attempt at a remake.",Friday the 13th
438,franksherman,Why do people let this man continue to ruin classics?,1,3 March 2009,Let me start this off by saying I had to give this film a 1/10 because I am unable to do a negative score.This man has butchered this franchise worse than Jason Voorhees has ever butchered a camper. Twenty minutes into this movies I saw Jason run.RUN!!! Jason doesn't even walk fast! My friend who is a long time fan like myself at this point in the movie insisted we walk out. I said we should give it a chance and see where it goes.I should have walked out at this point.What proceeded was an utter shame. I have two hours of my life that I want back! Here are a select few of my biggest problems( I say select because I do not want to be here all day).Is Jason even supernatural? Is he possibly Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remakes brother? Is Jason a trained electrician? I mean are you serious? The guy has trip wires set up? What is he sitting in his lazy boy just waiting for a random camper to come by so he can turn on the flood lights and kill them? Ace bandages? I remember in the first few he wore a burlap sack. Whats with the bandages? Where is the girl that killed Jasons mother? Are you kidding me? So these kids know that their have been murders at this camp previously and still decide to go out and find some herb? None of these kids camping decided to bring a knife?gun?big stick? I go camping and I always have at least a big knife.At least there was major boobage but that could not save the sinking ship that was this film.As we were leaving this film ( we went at midnight on Friday the 13th so I could very well be one of the first people subjected to this torture) I heard a group of 15-16 year olds expressing their pleasure in the cinematic experience.

439,sgtgunner-1,Old School + New School = Awesome,10,13 February 2009,Not too sure why there is in depth reviews about this film. It's a Slasher Film!! And an awesome one at that. It brings back the 80's genre of horror. It's is not meant to be picked apart by over-thinkers.If you liked ANY of the other F13's - then you will love this movie. I'm not 100% how I feel about the running - but he did run around a bit in part 3. My only worry with this film is they would lose the comedy - but they came through.When was the last time you heard cheers and clapping at a movie? I heard that at least ten times.Go now - stop reading this - move along.Why are you still here - go get a ticket.,Friday the 13th
440,stormtrooper2004,Should never of been allowed to pass the re-write phase,2,20 June 2009,"Firstly, I'm not a huge fan of the Friday the 13th films, but the character of Jason, I am, and all horror films. Also i don't mind remakes, if done tastefully, and add something more, some kind of improvement or there's no point, rob zombies Halloween for example, or the re-imaging of the batman series.Firslty, The first scene in the film, was a good idea, to show you Jason's origins, the part what made him want to kill, finally a reason to why he is what he is, and good reason too. To see your mother be-headed right in front of you, definitely a horror story plus. That is about all the positives in this film. Besides the acting, which for a bunch of unknowns, the acting is pretty good, especially with the p**s poor script they had to work with.You can tell there are a few Micheal bay scenes in there, just a few glimpses where he has had an input, they were the good bits, probably about 20 seconds from the whole film.Now the bad film..... firstly the first killings you see fully, take place just outside camp crystal lake, OK thats not too bad, its not like he can't move, but... there's cannabis growing there? and the first person to be killed is when he's,...trespassing on Jason's cannabis patch? Jason vorheevs a druggie? hmm not rite. There's no explanation as too who's the drugs are, and they just wouldn't grow there themselves.The way he kills the people in that scene is pretty good, although its too quickly into the start of the movie, there's no build up, although it plays a small part in the rest of the film, but he just kills them, that leaves you with no feeling for them, its like, oo he's killed him :\ what was his name? its almost pointless other than just to get you interested. understandable maybe, although poor.Then the next group, who the film then becomes about, are again OK, there a good bunch to watch a film about, the normal youths going to have fun drink, have sex etc...but instead of camp crystal lake being a camp, its now some rich kids fathers cabin, WOT!!! then why is Jason there? really, there is no sign of a camp, until later in the film there is 2 cabins, and one of them being Jason's....just poor, you don't even seen the camp. The main character clay, who's looking for his sister is an interesting character, and not only do you feel sympathy for losing his sister, but you feel respect, as hes a nice guy. Then as this goes on for a few minutes, two of the teenagers go off to the lake to wake board off a speedboat :\ on a lake :\ OK. Then within seconds again, no build up...the bloke gets speared with an arrow?? OK gruesome, a nice add to the already brutal killing skills of Jason, and then the boat happened to spin around and hit the girl in the water, which, just wouldn't happen, unless extremely unlucky. Anyway as the film goes on, they all get picked off, in OK ways, not particularly gr8, but average kill scenes with no chemistry though, its just tasteless blood and murder.Also the part about finding his mask, i thought like the Halloween remake, a good input, but not in this film....he just FINDS it, its a complete coincidence, how silly.Finally this film shows and tries to tell you parts of the originals, of why, when what happened etc, but if you haven't seen the originals, you would have no idea, as it doesn't ever really tell you anything. The final kill scene is pretty good. Until the very last second,, the complete steal from the end of the first film, or 1 of them cant remember which, but the bit where Jason jumps out of the lake, when they thought he was dead, and kills the remaining survivor. But there's 2 survivors!!!! he jumps out of the water, grabbing the girl, leaving the other survivor looking, and standing right next to them.........and it ends there poor ending, silly, complete steal and yet the rest is a different story, pointless, unsuccessful, stupid remake. Almost as though they already thought, oh we can make a second remake....but they didn't even get this 1 ryt, not chance...waste of any money and anytym u spend watching it, after reading reviews lyk this i still watched it, but IL be honest don't bother, if you do, just copy and past this because you will agree completely, even if you r a big fan of the originals, you cant lie to yourself.It was simple just to give Jason a good 30 minutes to him as a child, and what happened, give him a history in one film, don't give it away bit by bit in sequels. In a remake a strong story is needed, and there was less than ni the original in this, unless u new the story, you wouldn't have a clue what the story is.the 2 out of 10 is 1 for the few michael bay suggestons they may have taken, about 30 seconds or 3 scenes of them. And the other for the acting. I would give it another 1 for bravely attempting to remake it, as it has potential, and if done right could be very good, but the director, and anyone else who helped write the script, michael bay aside, had no effort and no care for this story or the characters, just for the money they would get just by using the title.Poor remake, with plenty of potential....until actually written.",Friday the 13th
441,robodog-5,Well done Jason,7,11 October 2009,"Slasher done right!!!! You betcha. Body count, actually seeing blood, an unkillable monster. Yes yes its all been done before but when you hit all the right marks you get something that stands out a little bit more from the rest of the pack. This is a true Friday the 13th, exploitative to the max! Just as they were always meant to be, only now with added budget. There is nothing to say other than this is a very solid piece of work. Did i mention funny? There's wit in some of these lines. Everybody has a zinger at some point and the cast pull them off rather than them falling flat out of the page. I wasn't expecting much out of this because there's been a lot of horror rubbish around as of late. I picked it up on a whim and i'm all the happier for it. Marcus Nispel can Direct the hell out of horror. This is two for two with him an platinum dunes now and i want to see what he can do next. I'd like to see him dabble in a bit of dark sci fi. Shame about Patherfinder though, everybody has a hiccup.",Friday the 13th
442,Jasonisalive,Amazing! A true masterpiece! I loved it!!!!!,8,6 July 2010,"My first review.I am going to start of by saying this movie was great! I loved it! I have gave it a 8/10 because not every movie is good on every angle, but personally, this movie is one of my favourite horror movies. I like how they had at the beginning a quick scene where you seen Jason's mother get killed. And then after that it jumped right into Jason Voorhees killing teens. I know a lot of people don't really like seeing remakes of old horror movies (personally, I agree) but this movie isn't a remake. Apart from the beginning, it has non of the original characters, or non of the same deaths and Jason is in it. I see it more as a re-imagining to the Franchise. I also think this works as a sequel, it is something new. If you haven't seen this movie, WATCH IT!!! I cant wait to see the sequel to this, and when it comes out and I watch it, I'll be sure to review it. There ya go! Thats my first review!",Friday the 13th
443,mellvsej,Way less than I expected,4,15 June 2009,"I went into this movie with high hopes. I have always been a big fan of the whole Friday the 13th series, but after watching this, I was left feeling very disappointed. It seemed like three quarters of the movie was either sex or Jason having mommy issues. We didn't get into the characters whatsoever (not like we would have wanted to with how annoying all of them were.) I am a big Jared Paledecki fan from watching Supernatural, but even he let me down on this one.The thing that bothered me the most about this whole movie was how smart they made Jason. The Jason from the original movies was all about being huge and scary, but he wasn't known for being smart. This movie had him setting traps and doing all kinds of things that Jason normally wouldn't do. People in the previous films were able to at least run away from him or hide for a while, but somehow the Jason in this film was always on top of where everyone was at all times. It just bugged me altogether. The horror genre is my all time favorite, but horror movies these days just aren't impressing me, and this is just another one of those.",Friday the 13th
444,Andy-1981,This garbage is Friday THE 13TH meets Farrelly Brothers meets Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE,1,20 February 2009,"(Slight spoilers, though nothing major. Hell, the whole rotten movie is a ""spoiler"")Upon viewing the opening third of this movie, I swear I thought the film had been written by Peter and Bobby Farrelly (the talentless brothers behind such pieces of dung such as THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY, and ME, MYSELF, AND IRENE) because the film assaulted the audience with embarrassingly crude, off-color, profanity-ridden dialogue.The film also stoops to presenting distressingly stereotypical characters, including blatantly adding the token black guy and the token Asian guy and then tries to poke fun at it! (""Just because I'm black, that mean I can't listen to Green Day?"") The film didn't get any better from there.As a longtime, die-hard Friday fan, I cringed as I watched the filmmakers completely destroy the myth and character of Jason Voorhees by turning him into a psycho, inbred redneck -- directly out of the Texas CHAINSAW series (directed by an individual who directed the crappy remake of that, and using actors from that remake too!). Absurd was the plot point of Jason holding the girl hostage (for reasons that were never truly made clear)-- since when has Jason EVER done anything like that? Oh right, we're making him into Leatherface now.The lighting was awful, the kills were mostly too fast and too dark to be enjoyed, Derek Mears was OK but unremarkable as Jason. I'll credit him for doing the best with the sickeningly bad material he had to work with.Worst of all, the film tries to have it both ways -- it tries to create a scary Jason, but makes the characters so repugnantly unappealing that the audience is rooting for Jason. You can't have your cake and eat it too: either have a scary Jason that we're rooting against because he's the villain, or portray him as the (anti)hero who's there to wipe out teenage scum. Not both.A couple good touches, such as the topless skiing scene (even though that didn't show off what it could've) and the ax kill (now THAT was pure Jason) can even begin to save this pile of sludge. But I'm sure we'll have another awful remake (or sequel to a remake), since this crap hit it big at the box office.Grade Z tripe.",Friday the 13th
445,HOWLING_MAD_DOC,The 13th Friday the 13th movie idea,4,30 October 2013,I have been watching Friday The 13th since I turned 13 in 1980. Oh and that movie was so great for all of us guys at Camp Wapsie Y in Iowa. The girls needed escorting to their cabins because they were afraid of Jason.I think the final and 13th movie of Friday the 13th needs to have Betsy Palmer return as Jason's mom to tell him his work is finished at the end of the movie. Another idea for that would be all the survivors from the movie series return to Camp Crystal Lake to at last put Jason down to rest.Also an explanation of sorts of Jason's powers and his mobility would be good.Would love to hear other ideas from long time watchers as myself as to how the Final and 13th Movie should go and end.Mad Doc,Friday the 13th
446,RZDickRider_2,What?,5,9 February 2009,"I love the original Friday the 13th films, they were meant to be all about partying and nudity but they had a certain charm. Sure that's what the remake is about also, while trying to add a stupid story, but it lost the charm over the years. Instead, we get 15 minute sex scenes with THE most awkward lines ever in a film, STUPID underground tunnels with full lighting where he hold prisoners (WTF?!). A girl who was underground for 6 weeks, and looks like she just showered a day ago. Also, what did Jason hand feed her for 6 weeks? So many dumb inconsistencies that could've been prevented if the writing wasn't so sloppy, and dumb. THE ABSOLUTE worst remake ever, besides The Fog of course. I'm only giving this a 2/10 for the amazing boobs in it. The gore wasn't even worth a 1/2 point as THERE WAS NO GORE AT ALL. No over the top deaths like the other Friday films. Screw you Michael Bay.",Friday the 13th
447,delusions_of_greed,"2 Words, Killing Spree!",6,13 February 2009,"First things first. For a horror re-make involving Michael Bay, its honestly not bad. Definitely better than the Halloween remake. but this is still your typical thriller/ horror. Lots of blood, killing, and nudity. the opening sequence was simply brilliant. There are a lot of unnecessary scenes, but it keeps you guessing (example: how they're going to die) throughout the entire movie. Friday the 13th will keep your heart pounding.... literally. (if you have a heart condition i wouldn't recommend watching this) The movie has a decent back story to it, only problem was it seemed like there wasn't much thought put into it. so if you're a fan of the original Friday the 13th, i'd say make time to watch this one, but overall i would give it a 6.5 possibly 7.",Friday the 13th
448,steve_r-1,Big problem with this film,4,16 February 2009,"Maybe I'm getting old - but this film wasn't good - thats because it has a fundamental problem. In a slasher film you really need to care about the people and in this film they are mostly so annoying that you almost hope they are gonna be killed - from the ""Token Black Dude"" who plays the race card to get out of doing things to the spoilt brat rich kid - The only feelings I had for these people were that I hope Jason gets them. Not really what you want for building up what little tension there is in this movie. The deaths in this film are signposted so far ahead that it takes away from any surprise and shocks that you may have gotten. Its a big disappointment and I only hope they do better with the Nightmare on Elm Street remake.",Friday the 13th
449,HammTate,Seeing Friday the 13th on Friday the 13th,3,13 February 2009,"I saw the late showing of this at my local cinema. I thought it would be good to see it on Friday the 13th (the day of its release here in the UK).I wouldn't exactly say I was disappointed with this, but I certainly wasn't pleasantly surprised either. Let's face it you know what to expect from a Friday (even a remake). There was nothing new here. Gratuitous sex was put in (excuse the pun) to make up for a lacklustre script. I find it insulting when these totally unnecessary scenes are inserted to supposedly appeal to the younger audience, who I am sure have access to porn dvds, should they wish to indulge themselves. Of course like many porn films every sexual scene was directed to ensure that the woman's body was on full show, while the man's was obscured. Nice bit of 80s sexploitation there. I have nothing against sex in movies. I thought the sex scene was totally essential to the plot in films like 'Fatal Attraction'. But I think that the formula for character development for this was that if you can't think of anything for a character to do, either show them having sex, or failing that, have them talking about sex. Even if they weren't doing it to one another, they were attempting to do it to themselves. Twice the 'porn mag' routine was used when the writers clearly had no other ideas.The camera work at the beginning was deliberately jumpy, and I found this totally unsuitable for this type of a film.Only one saving grace was Jason. It was good to see him behaving more like a mortal once again, than the superdemon that he had become in the later Fridays. BUT the problem with the film in general was that Jason just wasn't frightening. We saw too much of him early on, and the 'less is more' theory certainly went out of the window in this production.Seeing this at the cinema added nothing to my experience of this film, and my advice would be to save your money and see it when the DVD becomes available to rent. This film has less of the death factor and more of the cringe factor!",Friday the 13th
450,hereyesrolledback,lower your expectations.,3,15 February 2009,"this movie does most everything you'd expect it to do...and does so poorly. bad acting, dialog, cinematography, sound editing, and continuity. it seems like the casting director just pulled models from abercrombie and fitch, American eagle, and hollister catalogs, in lieu of holding auditions or doing screen tests. (the boys are prettier than the girls...no joke.) don't let the marketing fool you. it's not in the same league as the Texas chainsaw massacre remake. unexpectedly, this one pulls most of it's punches. by this i mean that the movie is relatively low on the gore/brutal violence scale. relatively quick kills, and short death scenes -- some aren't even shown. excessive marijuana and alcohol references, as well as multiple nude scenes (very few of which are worth seeing...the first one will leave you scratching your head, wondering if the girl was wearing those fake plastic breasts you can buy at spencer's gifts.) clearly built to appeal to a very low-brow crowd, and one that watches without a critical eye...or maybe watches without regard for what they're seeing at all. Friday the 13th openly plays below the intelligence of most movie-goers, and never aspires to much else. horror movies don't have to be mindless, nonetheless this one is. not many scares (other than audio-swell-startle-scares), actually a few good laughs. (well not ""good"" in the sense that you're supposed to laugh, but you know what i mean.) see this with friends that won't mind your snickering at it's absurdity...better yet, don't bother seeing it at all.",Friday the 13th
451,madmedic81,The good ole hardcore Jason is BACK,9,14 February 2009,"OK....a remake and reboot of the best slasher series in cinematic history has a LOT to live up to, and I have to say that, as one of the biggest fans of the series, this movie delivered, at least to me.This movie starts off with a bang....we get to see Mama Voorhees in all her psychotic glory going after the survivor of her mass murder at Camp Crystal Lake, and effectively getting her head lopped off (not straying from Cannon at all)...the big difference we see here is that (even though we KNOW Jason was watching in the original series, we just don't see him) we get to see a young Jason stumble upon his mother's corpse.From there, things get BRUTAL and FAST.I won't spoil too much about this movie in case you have not had the privilege of seeing it yet. I WILL say this.....no longer do we have to worry about the ridiculous magic daggers, body swapping, astronaut Jason, or ""Emo"" Jason of FvJ.....we are back to the basics.....a hulking, real life killer VERY reminiscent of the Jason in Part 2 through 4 (particularly 4, as this one seriously means business). The kills are absolutely brutal, and Jason is no longer the zombie we have been stuck with in the last seven films. He is fast again, the focus is all on his revenge for his mother again, and he is an incredible stalking monster of a hillbilly. We get a REAL sense of the ""creature who steals what he needs to survive"" that he was in the first few movies......and we are back to other familiar basics......like the ability to trick Jason with thoughts of his mother or his childhood. Oh, and the machete.....yeah, it gets some great use! I could really go on and on about how great this movie really is, but like I said, I DON'T want to give too much away. Go see it....prepare to have the snot scared out of you! Oh, and as always, NEVER assume Jason is dead just because he's down.....we ALL know better than that....",Friday the 13th
452,gottahustle,A Huge Fan That Was Let Down!,5,21 October 2011,"Too many liberty's with the film, killed it. Its plain and simple. I am a huge fan of the franchise. I own all the old films, and even re-bought the ones that were released on Blu ray. The way they tried to tie in elements from the first 4 films were not a good idea.Things moved too fast and too many things were meant for the viewer to already know. The whole lack of Mrs. Voorhees besides in the intro to the film was a mistake. The whole opening sequence that ended in 3 minutes, that wasn't even truly a scene but opening credits mixed with a flashback/scene just didn't cut it. The whole first movie, Jason wasn't even the killer. It was his mother. If your going to make a remake/re-imagining, how can you change who the main killer is? Its not a re-imagining of the first film, its a re-imagining of a franchise.This new Jason really doesn't seem like the Jason from the old films. First off, Jason moves slow and methodical, this new Jason is fast as lightning. Also he doesn't torture or kidnap people. You could see that from his first batch of victims. The kill where he hangs a girl from a tree in a sleeping bag over a camp fire is not a Jason kill, this kind of kill is way too over elaborate and is leaning more on the side of torture.If you know the series, you would know that Jason would never kidnap someone. Jason kills everyone period. That's just not the character. When a character in a film has over ten films in its series, the character is a long developed thing. Its far too late at that point to change major characteristics. It doesn't matter who or what the girl he took reminded him of, Jason cannot be around people, he just kills them. He cannot help himself.The cast of actors didn't really help the butchery of the film. Poor choices for the roles. They seemed like they were a little over qualified or were trying too hard. This type of film is meant for first time actors, especially this series. Much less seriousness from the actors playing the characters would have been a lot better.All in all, was very disappointed in this re-imagining of a classic slasher film. sometimes a fresh start or reboot can help bring a movie into modern times, and sometimes its a disaster. This one falls right in the middle.",Friday the 13th
453,metal360,The best installment in the series,8,16 February 2009,"Many remakes of horror classics never seem to be as good as the original. And that is mostly due to a different style of the new horror films, relying on gore instead of suspense. But unlike many horror classics, Friday the 13th was never a great film to begin with. But there were three things that kept us seeing each of the Friday the 13th films: naked teenagers, Jason, and creative murders. All of which there are plenty of in this flick. Many critics have criticized this movie for being ""cynical,"" and because most of the teenagers are so scummy. However, I personally thought that made the film much better. It made their deaths much more glorious. In all honesty, what horror fan has ever watched a Friday the 13th film and said ""please don't let Jason kill that character"" without the words ""before she gets naked"" at the end of the sentence? Not very many I would imagine.",Friday the 13th

It did not seem to follow the previous plot-lines at all! The very beginning of this movie was my first clue, when they redid the scene where Mrs. Voorhees gets her head cut off. I mean, come on! You couldn't have gotten the actual footage from the original? After that point, everything seemed to play out predictably. Admittedly, there were a few good kill scenes, like the girl in the sleeping bag, but other than that: slit throats, machete to the head, BORING!! We've seen em all before! And the ending? Please! First of all, you expect us to believe that those two puny kids who just got their asses handed to them carried Jason all the way to the dock? And second of all...Jason...coming up from under the water...and grabbing the girl. Gee, I wonder where that came from?!! If they wanted to make a sequel, they should've done the following: 1. Stayed true to the original plot (which they only did for small parts of the movie!) 2. Bumped it up a notch w/ special effects or new ways of death or the one I think they should've done 3.

Yes, this movie bears a striking resemblance to movie Hatchet. No, there is no moral to the story.If you want to see young punks get theirs, then this is the movie for you. There were plenty of thrills and laughs in this one!Truthfully, this movie may have lacked the same grittiness of the original, but that is because of the multimillion dollar budget. What it didn't lack, however, is action, perfect location, idiots to get sliced up, or laughs. I also love how the movie didn't get in its own way.

Unfortunately this movie is just like all the others, full of clichés. Animal Scare, Jason breaks through a window, Jason comes back at the end and teenagers having sex are killed horribly. All too common in movies like these. Jason was well portrayed by Derek Mears, big, bulky and scary...just like all the rest.Not all the acting was bad, Aaron Yoo gave a terrific performance as Chewie, the stoner. As his first words in the movie are 'Babies have more room in the uterus' as he gets out of the back of a van. The movie had more nudity in it than it did violence, which brought the level of the movie by a lot. A total of 3 nude women. Anyway, the movie was most agreeably better than its original 11 remakes, but not enough to redeem itself.

459,jonas33333,Friday the 13th(2009) - A Stupendous Addition to the Series,10,13 February 2009,"As a fan of the horror genre and all the ones in this series that matter, I am thrilled to finally say ""Thank you for doing it right!!!"" to the people involved with making this film.I didn't expect it to be good. I walked into the theater wondering ""How are they going to mess this one up?"" Years of remakes have made me and presumably many others calloused and weary of all the foul-ups. This fan is very pleased.To begin with, this time was different. I actually felt like I did while originally watching the better parts of this series (1,2,3,4,6 and a little 7). The ambiance of Crystal Lake is executed perfectly which is a vital aspect to this series. The woods, the lake, the cabins all take on the elements needed for just the right setting. Great lighting and effects add to the suspense nicely.The film has just the right mix of suspense, horror, comedy and gratuitous nudity that are required for a Friday the 13th movie. In some ways, it is more suspenseful than any of the originals and if I might add, a little scarier as well for those that are not as ""de-sensitized"" as yours truly. The acting/directing was certainly a helpful hand to the additional fear element as the actors maintained a nice brevity between real fear, comic delivery and enough ""over the top on purpose"" character development to play the ideal camp victims that they are. Nice directing choices there.The death scenes were both gratifying and terrifying with touches of humor and the count was not disappointing. Some of the scenes were a touch too quick. The blood is very realistic and the gore even more so. I would have liked to see one heavy splattering but the variety was well done.Jason himself is well portrayed and it's enjoyable to see him large and in charge in his turf. I feared the preview images of him running, but this was actually not overdone at all. He's just as ominous as ever with his clearly forceful determination to maintain his loner atmosphere and follow his mama's lead.I find myself going back and forth between seeing this as a remake/re-imagining and wanting to declare it as it's own rightful installment of the series. I'm sure the producers must have been tempted to do the same. Aspects of several of the prior films were pulled together to echo the originals and should be a treat for the hardcore fans. It was for me anyway. Regardless, this movie is far superior to the lesser, extremely crappy installments of the Friday the 13th films. Thanks again.",Friday the 13th
460,Spammyhammy1007,How dare they?,1,17 February 2009,"How dare they? New Line, Paramount, Platinum Dunes, and Marcus Nispel...how dare you? I have been a horror fan ever since I was 6 years old. I have watched them all...from Wes Craven, to Dario Argento, to Carpenter, to Alfred Sole, to Hitchcock, and now Marcus Nispel.This movie is just plain awful, and not because it doesn't have enough gore, or it doesn't have the endangered teenager, but because I just laughed the entire time. The predictability, the insertion of the minority, the gratuitous sex scenes, the one-liners, and the faux scares...it's all there. What really gets me, is that every stereotype of a horror film was there, and it just saddens me. I am sick of homages, and I am sick of directors coming along and proving that they can take a movie, and just make it a little more ""21st Century"" for us. It doesn't work.Some of you might hate me for saying this, but it's true...Rob Zombie has the right idea. He has the balls and the know-how to make something his own. I hate when anyone tells me that the remake of Halloween sucked. Why? Because it was just too real for you? It hit too close to home? I'll tell you what, horror and gore is supposed to tap into that part of the mind, that something like this could really happen.Friday the 13th started out with amazing potential, it really did. The first 20 minutes were just heart-pounding, classic horror movie plot, but then it skewed toward the awful part of the bell curve. I sat there, once seeing every horror movie gore-fest in the past, and just predicted every little thing. I laughed at the funny parts (which were excessive) and I laughed even more at the predictability. If horror movies were meant for feeble-minded people below the age of 17, they wouldn't rate them Restricted. What happened to the brashness? What happened to the awe, the creepiness, and the surprise? What happened to Jason being an intellectually disabled, emotionally devoid human being? When did these writers decide just make him a ruthless killing machine? Was Jason a killing machine in Part 2? No, he was a man on a mission to murder those who had killed his mother in an attempt to avenge her. What happened to the crafty camera work? I am sorry, but I have been waiting for this day all my life, and I just cannot believe that I laughed at the parts that weren't supposed to be funny. I should have known that the writers of F v J would have produced such a god-awful piece of work.If a movie is to be remade ever again, please think about making it your own. This was not Marcus Nispel's film. It was Michael Bay's, and it was just awful, like every other movie he has made. Why couldn't Jason be a normal human being that just liked to kill people? I find that a lot more scary than anything else. This was like The Burning, only 2009.Watch Henry, Portrait of a Serial Killer...watch Black Christmas (1974), watch Last House On The Left, something Tobe Hooper made, and here's a real treat...Behind The Mask: The Rise of Leslie Vernon or The Orphanage...NOT THIS CRAP!!",Friday the 13th
461,Costa456,Finally...A remake not only done right but surpasses the sequels after 4,6,17 February 2009,"I saw this movie opening night with a bunch of friends and was excited. I only liked the movies up to Part 4 and then after that I didn't really care for them much. As I sat down in the theater, I couldn't wait for the movie to start. I was waiting for this moment since I first heard about the production of the movie. I liked the Texas Chainsaw Massacre Remake and was glad to see that Friday the 13th was going into the right hands.Right after the opening credits with the recap part 1( I didn't like how they did that BTW) we are thrust into the movie, which I'm going to say is the most intense opening sequence I have ever seen in a horror film. After that, the film all went up hill for me! The dialog was good for a Friday movie and the acting was also pretty good. The kills could have been more creative but they were all right for what they were. I loved how they made Jason more human in this movie and not zombie like. They also made Jason smart and trap his victims which I thought was a great addition to the series. All in all, this movie is a fun horror film that returns the spirit of the Friday films. If you like horror or Friday the 13th...go see this film!",Friday the 13th
462,jamestaylorstables,disgrace to the franchise,1,7 February 2021,"Cliche as heck, And these young directors and writers try to tell us (who lived through the era of the franchise from the beginning in the cinemas after being born in the early 70s) How Jason gets around the camp so quickly. For decades we've had awesome conversations around our theories and then these young Joe makers think they can tell us that Jason had gone through tunnels to get everywhere. what a load of BS! . That's not even a creative idea. Second of all it just completely destroys the mystery and uniqueness of his skill set. I seriously cannot watch movies made after 1995 now.
I feel sorry for people born in gen y/z having to be related to this void of creativity. Every actress and actor in these movies made after 95 and especially in this abomination of a remake have to be good looking unbelievably annoying cliché racially perfectly diverse to the point where I am A huge fan of the franchise and saw all the films in the cinema as a young kid and I could not bear to watch after about 15 minutes of this new remake it sits in my box at unwatched cause I got to the point where I literally was going to snap the disc in half Or turn it off.",Friday the 13th
463,jdrakeh,"Good for real slasher fans (and not a bad re-imagining, either).",8,17 February 2009,"Do you know what Italian movie inspired almost all of the kill scenes in the original Friday the 13th film? If you do (and didn't have to Google to find the answer), this reboot of the Friday franchise is for you! Michael Bay manages to tone down the overt humor of more recent Friday installments, ditch the lame supernatural elements completely, and resurrect Jason as the crazed, reclusive, wild man that he was originally portrayed as in Friday the 13th Part II.Bay's burlap sack-wearing psycho is a nice homage to the earlier (i.e., scary) films in the franchise, taking the best bits of Jason from the original film, as well as Parts II and III, and molding them into a clever, violent, predator.For the first time in almost two decades, Jason isn't portrayed as a slow-moving, mentally deficient, zombie with supernatural powers and an arsenal of running prop gags that put Carrot Top to shame. This is a good thing.This new, re-imagined, Jason made it much easier for me to suspend my disbelief than any of Hodder's incarnations have and the payoff was some genuine discomfort.As for the gore  it's stylish. Recalling the artful executions of the Italian Giallo genre, the kill scenes in this new Friday (from an arrow through the head to an instance of sleeping bag immolation) are brutal enough to shock but not on screen long enough to be tasteless.Now, in an age dominated by the rampant excess of Eli Roth, stylish gore and tasteful brutality are lost on many theater patrons  which is why I opened this review as I did. If you answered that question, you know that the best gore is defined by execution, not excess.Bay gets it right. The kill scenes in this new Friday feature are absolutely artistic.And the nudity? Let's talk about the nudity  a lot of people are convinced that teenage breasts are a fundamental feature of slasher films. Those people are going to be disappointed with the new Friday. Really disappointed. Thankfully, I'm not one of those people! As somebody who has watched a great many slasher films from around the world, I'm convinced that gratuitous nudity is indulged only in the worst films that the genre has to offer, serving as a device to distract the predominantly male audience members from a work's otherwise obvious pitfalls.The short version of a much longer thesis is that the more gratuitous nudity a slasher flick contains, the thinner the plot, the worse the acting, and the less worthy it is of your hard-earned cash. Bay's new horror epic contains a single scene of prolonged partial nudity.Finally, let's look at the acting. Going in, one will do well to remember that this is a slasher flick and that most acting will consist of screaming, bleeding, or running through the woods screaming *and* bleeding. If you're looking for Oscar material here, you're looking in the wrong place (and arguably the wrong film genre).The screaming and bleeding is something that the actors in this new Friday the 13th have down pat. Predictably, however, things fall down in the dramatic acting department. This isn't to say that the acting is bad  it's absolutely not. It just isn't very memorable. The real star of this move is the mute, axe-wielding, maniac.So, the final verdict? Well, again, it all depends on if you can answer my first question without cheating. If you can, see this movie. If you can't? Well, you'll probably be better off watching the next re-skinned Scream retread.",Friday the 13th

Jared Padalecki & Danielle Panabaker are familiar faces now--nice to see them give such solid performances as youngsters.
Padalecki in particular is really good, very different from his CW character.The special effects were good for the budget, the casting of support characters excellent, the music & ""ominous sound cues"" worked.I HAVE watched the original & this is different, which might cause some diehards dissonance, but I like how this reboot worked.",Friday the 13th

I'll say it- I'm a big fan of slasher flicks from the 80s (and some late 70s). So I generally skip remakes of the classics Ive enjoyed for years altogether & get very put off by them. I'm only a super fan of the original & 1st sequel-but just liked the third one. Didn't care for the rest.Admittedly, I checked this remake out strictly because Jared Padelecki is one of my favorite actors & as a Supernatural FANATIC, I was proud of Padelecki's performance outside of his ""comfort zone"". I also found myself cheering Jason on for his murder creativity & all over freakiness.

Being a huge fan of the original films though I was horribly disappointed.Part of the mythology of Jason is that he DOES NOT RUN AFTER YOU! he stalks and then appears in front of you after you've gassed yourself from running breakneck speed through the woods. He had that supernatural mystique associated with him and that is COMPLETELY GONE in this film. I mean come on, he has his own underground lair and sets booby traps up? LAME he wasn't scary at all in this movie and that was unfortunate. Once again Hollywood tries to ""improve"" on something that didn't need to be improved upon. The subtleties of his character before were much more menacing than they are now where he runs around like some normal serial killer. BLAH! This Jason is much like the zombies in the remake of Dawn of the Dead from a few years ago where apparently when you die you turn into a Kenyan sprinter. The original slow pace was more terrifying because no matter what they'd catch up to you or would be around the corner. You could not outrun forever. This incarnation of Jason is in the same mold as the new zombies. Bigger and faster does not equal scarier! I miss Kane Hodder! The woods also looked like crap, WAAAAY too fake looking. Sorry but moonlight does not play perfectly to heighten the mood over and over. This one lost the original feel of the woods and made everything way too dark.I think the absolute lamest thing about the film was when Jason needed to turn the power on to see around his little homebase. Seriously, it's JASON VORHEES! since when does he need to flip the lights on to do something? lol HORRIBLE FILM",Friday the 13th

There is an actual plot, the runtime is not spent stalling, and not all the characters have empty heads.However, once you compare it to the films of today, there really is not much here that gives it an edge. The dialogue comes with some incredibly awkward and already outdated race jokes. The characters may not be the disposable bodies they were before, but the cast still feels like an all star gathering of horror stereotypes.

472,marq_6993,Just Right. (in some areas),6,7 March 2011,"On February 13th, 2009 another horror remake was brought to the new generation of horror fans. As there are ups, there are downs that come along for the ride.The storyline that is hidden under the CGI graphic violence and hot co- eds is an interesting plot outline that has not been used yet. I am a fan of the old classic ones and this version isn't one but at least the first four films joined into one feature, which I mentioned earlier ""has not been used yet.""Five young adults that end up camping near the infamous Camp Crystal Lake have no idea the dangerous machete-wielding maniac Jason Voorhees living there is unhappy with the intrusion and dices them all but one victim(Whitney) who Jason takes as prisoner. Six weeks later the older brother of the girl(Clay) comes to seek her, then in the meantime another group of young adults come to spend vacation in a cabin also near the camp which once again makes Mr. Voorhees unhappy. Later when Clay comes to the cabin to get any information on his sister, reliable Jenna offers to help him search. But when those from the group of young adults start getting slaughtered, Clay, Jenna, and the group face great danger which is for some where the fun begins.One of the positives I see is an acceptable script, the negative is the nudity/sex that is way over the top explicit that I certainly wasn't expecting. The violence was just right where I expected with a few bizarre bloodbaths (the screwdriver scene).It will be best to keep this away from the kids, not recommended for everyone so the very squeamish should move this along but horror fans should give it a chance.Rated R for: Graphic Violence, Adult Language, Adult Content, Nudity, Strong Sexual Content.(HBO advisory)",Friday the 13th

That's right. He has traps set. And warning systems in place.Jason takes prisoners? That's right. He's smart enough to think clearly enough to set traps and warning systems, but he's not smart enough to understand that a teenage girl ISN'T his mother.Did I mention that Jason runs? Seriously. I'm still angry about this.None of the characters are even remotely likable. They are overly done stereotypes, but not the stereotypes we all know and love. They are just dumb versions of stereotypes.None of the deaths are even remotely memorable. They are just your average run of the mill ""someone gets stabbed with something"" kinds of deaths.Seriously, Jason runs almost the entire movie!!!! For me, though, the topper of it all is that Jason didn't once get confused and tilt his head. Not once. And he had quite a few opportunities to do so. Like when he was running he should have looked at himself and thought ""This makes no sense."" Or when he was setting traps and warning systems. Or when he was holding a girl hostage because she kinda looked like his mom.This movie almost makes Jason X look like a decent movie.",Friday the 13th

I've felt since ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" that the series was going down hill, in fact after the rights for the franchise was sold off to ""New Line Cinema"" that the franchise had been lacking a lot of substance and effort. Not till ""Freddy V.S Jason"" did the franchise get a little bump up, the two Icons stayed true and got a little more brutal thanks to direction Ronny Yu.That being said I knew if there wasn't another Freddy V.S Jason the Friday series would have to be remade. I knew/feared this day would come, however when I saw the 1st trailer I was relieved to see Jason not only isn't a zombie anymore but is finally running again and hasn't ran since ""Friday the 13th Part 4"". So I was really glad to see that it had to go old school to be revived. However being that Michael Bay was involved that scared is because I wasn't that into ""The Texas chainsaw Massacre"" remake I think he wanted to get his hands on some better money with a die hard built in audience.What I finally felt about this film was that it was way to short! They were combining sequels 1-4 into one film. The 1st film as all fans would know was only Jason's mom and only opening credits in this film were dedicated to that film. Everything else was shot to fast and had no back story at all. If they were going to show it might as well have done @ least 20 min to due the back story justice and might as well show some extra stuff to please some fans, ( As did Ronny Yu, in Freddy Vs Jason).So the lack of back story displeased me a lot since die hard fans and new fans have to sit through a weak attempt at one of horrors favorite characters. Jason himself was better than ever I would say. Yes they went old school with him, so he's obviously not dead and alive and breathing. His look was across between sequels 2-3 which was a good choice I thought. Him running was cool to see since the walking became old and cliché. I thought Derek Mears did a good job on that. I wish there was more of a Camp Crystal Lake environment rather than just a single house; I wanted ""Camp Blood"" that was also missing in this film, the cool terror story of camp blood. It would have been cooler to see a town rather than just one store since this is shot in present time. Would have been cool to see civilization then watch the characters disappear into this forest type/abyss then die. Only two characters in this film you sympathized with or cared for and those were the two minorities in the film ( Aaron Yoo, Arlen Escapeta), everyone else could have died sooner. I say this film was entertaining and Jason was awesome. But they need to get a new director or a better writing team who know this franchise a little better and devote a 2hour film and learn about showing back story. This franchise will have plenty of sequels and I hope they throw this film a bone and develop a little more story/time to ita lot of scenes didn't have time to breath. Positive things in this film, Jason Kicked Ass/looked great, Some old school qualities ,Film had a budget, T& A ,BloodNegative Little to 0.1 back stories, Steered to far from original film, Michael Bay,Weak Writing team ,Zero Paces ,Directing needs some work, No classic Music, History has been re-written",Friday the 13th

To my surprise he's saved an entire franchise. The theater I went to was completely sold out. I sat in the theater and when the movie opened up I recognized instantly this was a remade version of the finale from the original Friday the 13th (which Jason was not the killer). Then it goes to modern day and if you know the rules of a slasher film you know who isn't going to live the entire scene. For about 15 minutes Jason goes and kills everyone he can find all before the title comes up! Me and the audience were in disbelief. Jason actually scared me! I know before the movie came out there was concern about Jason running (which he doesn't usually do). Him running makes it even scarier. This film doesn't go over board as much as the old ones did. They aren't trying to figure him out they just want to survive. This Jason I believe is the way he should have always been. There isn't even enough room to write everything good about this film.

Overall it was campy, serious when it had to be, bloody, and the first film of the series in exactly 20 years to have the words ""Friday The 13th"" in it's title. I really wish the opening 23 minutes had been a quick retelling of Mrs. Voorhees' rampage instead of Jason killing campers. Instead, we don't see Mrs. Voorhees kill anyone. That being said, the opening 23 minutes is easily my favorite part of the film. I still like this more than a lot of the other films that came after the first four (5, 7, 8, JGTH, Jason X, FvsJ) so it's safe to say it didn't disappoint.

His mask which he eventually finds, looks really awesome and grittier than normal. It's basically the first 3 movies (minus the boring parts) rolled into one. And the overall look of Jason may be one of my favorites in the entire franchise. Jason really is a MASSIVE lumbering maniac.Now, why people hated this movie really makes no sense to me. One of the things you always hear from slasher films is ""How does the killer catch up to them?"" or ""How did he know they were there!?"". Well, this reboot explains all of that, which I thought was seriously amazing. We've got this big giant maniac of a creep, with underground tunnels and caverns, with booby traps all over the camp to know at all times where these stupid kids are. I love that. I also loved how they used the whole summer camp thing in this as well. His archery skills and his axe throwing, I thought were really neat and pretty brutal really.We get some great kills in this movie, as well as some iconic scenes. The whole wood chipper chain necklace scene is in this one, and done really well.For me, this movie nailed it. It had the gore. It had the stupid kids, and the one scummy kid that you couldn't wait to see die, a girl getting steamed alive in a sleeping bag. What's not to like? And one of my absolute FAVORITE things ever, was just the beastly-ness of Jason.

If it wasn't the lame slasher style killing (no real suspense) or the black guy making really bad racial jokes, the Friday the 13th marathon of bad movies has followed right behind jason in outerspace, or whatever that piece of crap was named. Don't waste your money, don't waste your time, don't waste a single second on this movie. Why cant all horror movies be made by Rob Zombie? Now thats some ingenious movie making. As I am writing this I am 20 beers deep and still laughing that I wasted my money on this film. I should have spent my money on buying a copy of ""House of Wax"".... about the same level of movie making,,, really bad....

In my opinion, they were ok movies that gradually got dumber and dumber. I still don't see why Jason Goes to Hell was ever green lit. Though, I did like Jason X, for some reason. I dunno, Jason in the future seems like an interesting concept. But this movie takes the once goofy series right back to its roots. It tells basically the same story as the first two movies, but with much better effects and acting. I don't blame the old movies for the lame effects, but the acting DEFINITELY needed work back then. I'm just glad it was Nightmare on Elm street bad acting. Anyway, this movie has some awesome moments, ignoring the sex, and Jason himself is intimidating as HECK. He's big, strong, and silent. My only issue, and it's a small one, is the fact that you don't ever REALLY see his face. You see it twice, but it's always obstructed. Once by shadows and once by the lake. Other than that, I can DEFINITELY say I'm glad I watched it.",Friday the 13th
490,cmbstudio,The Movie was Great!,9,13 February 2009,"I'm a huge Friday the 13th Fan for one reason... it's a fun ride. This ride was a pure Date flick. It had a mixture of Drama, scares and laughters. I love the way they flashed the backstory. It was quick and precise with the right temperament for the audience to know jason's motives.The Characters were fun. They were light hearted and Naive yes. But hey, it is Friday the 13th film. I enjoyed a lot of the actors especially the Asian actor Aaron Yoo. He added the proper humor to the film. The Women were sexy as hell....Damn Crystal Lake rocks! Drugs, sex,etc... what do you think a group of kids are going to do on vacation?..play hide and seek.As far as my opinion on Jason. He was awesome!!! He was quick and strong providing the proper course of weopens for his killing style. He really captured the esscence of Jason Vorhees from the original first four films. I hope they continue the story of Jason being alive and not a zombie...He is much more interesting. It's not an Oscar awarding film, so if you potheads are looking for that measurment of grandstand filming, You went to the wrong film. If you are looking to have a goodtime and heart jumping fun.

492,n-stackhouse,"Great Jason, Average Friday film",5,4 March 2012,"Okay, first off Derek Mears was a great choice to play Jason and is probably the best thing in this film. His Jason is cunning and fast, and the idea of making Jason into a territorial creature was interesting. You can tell from the interviews that Mears had a lot of passion and energy for the role and it showes. With that said the rest of the film is pretty standard slasher fair. The cast of campers are by in large unlikeable and half the time I was rooting for Jason to kill them. To be fair the actors only delivered what was required of them but the way the characters were written made them come off either as unlikeable or weak and bland. In the early Fri films the campers were likable characters who just wanted to have fun and relax and you were interested in what would happen to them. Another problem is that this film really doesn't feel like a reboot. The opening sequence feels more like a recap of Jasons' origins and not the launching point for a new version of the character. The film is just a rehash of most of the previous films, albeit with well done special effects and stunts. Maybe if they had had Derek Mears play the role without make up and the hockey mask and focused on Jason himself and his point of view and delved into his motivations more it would've worked better. Overall though this is an entertaining Friday film, but not the shot in the arm the series needed for a long term resurgence.",Friday the 13th
493,primogen18,Pointless,1,23 February 2009,"**SPOILERS**I'm not a big fan of most remakes these days, but if done right they can be enjoyable updates. Halloween is a classic horror slasher, and I loathed the fact it was being remade until I was pleasantly surprised. It added a bit more story and some fun gore. It was perfect and still couldn't touch the original, but it wasn't what I'd call FT13th, utterly pointless. Not only does this add NOTHING to the story, but also takes away some. Jason's mom was the pre-title ""flashback in black in white"" story. The kills were just plain boring and don't even come close to a lot of the original movies. The whole ""stumbling on the old house of jason"" thing was just.... stupid, I mean why did he live so close to the camp? how was he disfigured or whatever since they don't bother going into that or his random resurrection. (though supposedly this was going to explain the ""orgin of jason. This also lead it to be like any other ""freaks in an old desolate house who become killers"" story which just about makes it way into every single horror these days. The characters are people who as soon as they are on screen you can't wait to see them suffer and die, which when you do is unsatisfying as again the kills are quite boring. They are that annoying, really. ""lets randomly look for pot in the middle of the woods.. oh look, camp crystal lake where that killer is, OK lets still look for pot and be morons"". The typical college students aren't any better and you never care for any of the characters.Overall, it was just.. boring and pointless. The deaths are lame, the characters are lame, the story is retarded (one thing they didn't have to change completely, reopening the camp would give a better reason to be there then a field of pot somehow growing in the woods). This might work as part 11, which they should have done last minute (slapped a part 11 at the end) and seriously I would have enjoyed it better had they passed it as a sequel and not a remake.

494,rucampbell,Friday the 13th: Jason's Boring,1,6 November 2021,"The original movies were not the best quality sometimes, but this reboot is terrible. Starts with a long boring round the campfire explanation about how Mrs Voorhees's, all those years ago, killed camp counsellors in revenge for her son's drowning (would you even watch this movie if you didn't know the backstory?).So the first victim dies, apparently for peeing on cannabis, and the rest find themselves at Camp Crystal Lake where they all die quickly and lose their heads to something sharp.Sadly the script isn't sharp at all.It's all too unoriginal, in a franchise that ran out of original in the mid-1980s.

495,eddiegr7,"nothing new, but a great remake!",7,20 January 2010,"The remake of ""Friday the 13th"" adds nothing new to the slasher genre, but it's without a doubt a great remake! First off let me say that Derek Mears portrayed Jason so beautifully. Ken Kirzinger's portrayal in ""Freddy vs Jason"" didn't excite or scare me. Derek Mears, on the other hand, is super scary! Now the next thing I want to mention are the kills. They are very cool and unique. I like that he pretty much uses only his machete (in a few cases he uses other weapons like a bow and arrow... which happens to be one of my favorite kills in the movie). And now for my favorite thing about this film: the incredible sex scene between Julianna Guill and Travis Van Winkle. Wow! This is probably the best and most erotic sex scene I've seen in a long, long time! And Mr. Van Winkle is dead on with his comment about her tits being stupendous. Overall... watch this film for Derek Mears' awesome portrayal, the kills, and the OMG sex scene.",Friday the 13th

498,Lights_Camera_Reaction,"This movie was thrilling, exciting and the perfect remake!",7,15 February 2009,"This new Friday movie has those references to the early Friday films, which is a massive positive. Here's my number one thing I look for in any remake: It holds true to the original, but it brings new, insightful, and creative elements to the table.That's exactly what this Friday the 13th did. It took elements from the originals and expanded on them. The opening credit sequence was A) some of the best editing I've seen in a film lately, and B) tension-filled. Very rarely in horror films am I in awe, first of all, and secondly, scared. For some reason, this opening scene had my heart beating. Could have been the loudness, the flashing, the black-and-white, I don't know, but it was something this film had to offer - i.e. respectable.The scene following immediately was another scene where I could not believe my eyes. The dialogue was REAL. That is how people that age talk, that is how my friends and I talk, it was real. That was entertaining. That was comedy. This movie took us to a level where we are able to care about these characters, not because they're just going to bang and die, but because these people are just like the people we know. We would be shocked if this happened to our friends, obviously.Jason, in this scene, is brutal. He burns a girl as she's in a sleeping bag hanging over a fire, he uses a bear-trap to trap a victim, rather than just stalk and kill, like he's Rambo. This is a NEW Jason. Get that, people. He's NEW. This is a revamp. This is believable. This is where the new Halloween failed, guys. Halloween expanded on that childhood and made us empathize even though the new Michael was a pyschopath. Jason, on the other hand, is a hunter. He is a killer. He is pyschotic and human, i.e. terrifying.The rest of this movie offers laughs, tension, terror, blood, but not too much, and you know what? Now, that's refreshing. Too often do movies use gore and blood as a crutch. A movie like The Hills Have Eyes offered a lot of blood and gore, a lot of shocks and terror, but it was actually really good.And I'm not someone who loves every remake, because I don't. I hated Halloween, and I hated Texas Chainsaw. Both failed in my mind because, well, I've stated Halloween's reason already, but TCM failed because it was just... too much of a remake. Not a lot was brought to the table, and strangely, it was slow. It's as if the writers and director (yes, I realize they're the same as Friday), wanted to do that kind of indie-film technique and slow it down, pace it, etc. But, Friday the 13th did that, and it was very well done. There are parts that are slow and attempt to calm us down as the audience, and there are parts that are relentless. That is needed. And because of that slowness and relentlessness at different times, this film IS reminiscent of the original series. It has that indie-quality, yet is Hollywood with a budget.The only thing I would change, going with the Hollywood thing, is the ending. My perfect ending would have been to let Jason keep his head bouncing on the chipper. The two take a breather and watch him. Perhaps one last close up of Jason? The final two characters begin to walk as the guy puts his arm around his kid sister's shoulder. They limp out of the barn as the light leaves them in silhouette outside. Jason's head bounces still to the left of frame. We slowly fade to black.I didn't hate the ending of this one. But I just love the fact of having a stand-alone movie. This ending has an open-ending, by the way, but no studio would use it because it doesn't have that punch. To me, that punch happened in the chain sequence. We needed that unwind throughout them leaving and the credits. Then reflect, and love it.",Friday the 13th
499,alternate-dan,Friday the 13th delivers!,7,13 February 2009,"With an excellent crowd of audience, a fresh, new take on Friday the 13th ""remake"" and Jason Voorhees back to his original roots at Crystal LakeI couldn't be more entertained than I was during this wild slasher flick.Plot crunch: Friends Wade, Amanda, Richie, Whitney and her boyfriend Mike go camping at Crystal Lake in search for a field of growing Marijuana plants that appears to be somewhere close to the old, rusty and legendary Camp Crystal Lake. However, after Wade has spooked his crew by the of Jason Voorhees, they never thought they'd actually stumble upon the killer himself. Turns out that Jason isn't just a legend, and he starts the new Friday the 13th with insane killing sequences. Then we meet Clay Miller who returns once again, apparently, to Crystal Lake to look for his missing sister Whitney, who was last seen near Crystal Lake. Hee meets a group of college kids who are spending a wild weekend at one rich kid's parent's cabin. The following kids are alpha male Trent, who seems to be provoked by Clay after his date for the weekend; good-girl Jenna, helps him look around in the woods, slutty Bree, hilarious token (Asian) Chewie and (African-American) Lawrence, free-spirited Chelsea and sex-seeking Nolan. But as soon as Jason finds out that they are in his woods, all hell breaks loose. On Friday the 13th, the kids wind up in Jason's vicious hands and suffer horrible fates as the day rushes to a heart pounding night of terror at Crystal Lake.First: The movie was bad-ass. As a big fan of most of Friday the 13th films (Part 1 to 5 mainly, Part 2 being my all-time favorite), I could see some fun references that were in the original movies of the series. There's enough fun nudity and sex sequences, but they aren't really that rough and instead make them look funny as Jason attempts to distract one of the couples for his next prey. The killing/death sequences are very, very disturbing during some parts (a girl is burned alive inside a sleeping bag that hangs above a campfire, a guy is tortured with an ax thrown into his back but Jason ruthlessly pushes him on the back and it impales through his chest, and one guy is impaled but that's not enoughhe's shoved onto a back of a truck with these poles sticking out and it impales him so badly, then the car drives off with his feet dragging along the road).Second: Jason was insane. I haven't seen him so ruthless and brutal since Part 7 (in his uncut killing sequences that were trimmed down by the MPAA, but search for them on YouTube). And the best thing I liked about him is that he ran furiously after some of his victims. He did walk, but oh boy, did he run too! He wasn't super-humanwell, up until the end he kind of was, but hey, he had a thick neck! But throughout the entire movie, his victims managed to injure him. However, it didn't stop him from killing some more. My only problem was that Jason't wasn't too much on screen, because I would've wanted to see more scenes on him. But the movie was only 97 minutes so I'm bumped for the unrated DVD release.Third: For me, the acting was slightly above-average for actors who I'd never seen before (Willa Ford, Julianna Guill, Arlen Escarpeta and Jonathan Sadowski). Jared Padalecki and Danielle Panabaker were quite a good leading couple, and Amanda Righetti's performance was really good. But cut to characters. Despite for all of them being stunning and beautiful, I enjoyed every single one of them, but I just couldn't help but to want to know something more about them. I knew what everyone's names were from looking at the film's IMDb page but I didn't hear many characters' names up until near the end. More character development, or simply less characters in the movie, would have done justice for me. But I prefer Whitney and co. over Trent and co.Fourth: Now I'm really not a guy who notices if one's directing on a movie is good or not. Don't blame me, I just forget and I barely know how to spot it. But all I can say is that I think Marcus Nispel did a fine job on this new Friday the 13th, and I surprisingly didn't see much similarity or style to his take on The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, since some people seem to notice. This movie, however, should have been longer than only 97 minutes. Some parts felt kind of rushed and some characters didn't really get to shine. Let's just say that the phase could have worked out better. And one last thing, the writing could have been strictly better. There wasn't enough suspense like in the first four Friday flicks.But here are some ""best of the best"" in the movie that I want to share. Favorite character: I would have to say either Chewie or Lawrence because those two were hilarious, but my vote goes to Trent. You can't help but to love to hate the guy! Favorite death sequence: It's a tie between the sleeping-bag-on-fire and impaled-by-poles-on-truck.Overall: I give this a solid 8/10 for being a crazy-fun bloody slasher ride and Jason's return was phenomenon. Plus, one of my favorite ""teen-idol"" actorsPadaleckiwas playing the lead role and I think he did good. I actually didn't see one bit of Sam Winchester there, to be honest. In addition, I had a very, very good and lively crowd inside the theater. I couldn't have asked for a better Friday night at the movies.As a fan of the Friday the 13th franchise, this one is a strong entry to a reboot.",Friday the 13th

The movie wasn't the greatest compared to Jensen Ackles' movie last month but it was the best in the Friday the 13th franchise so far.

502,steaston,Not good....,3,14 March 2009,"I was excited going into this movie. I read good reviews, and was encouraged by the fact that it performed so well in the box office and has enjoyed such a lengthy time in the theaters. I am a huge fan of the genre, the trailer was cool, and Jason is unquestionably a terrifying horror villain. Unfortunately, this movie really, really sucks. Marcus Nispel, whose efforts in remaking the Texas Chainsaw Massacre were highly commendable, may have never had a chance here. The script is the flattest high-budget horror script I have ever seen. The acting is terrible. I read a review which compared this film to such recent horror remakes as ""the hills have eyes,"" ""the Texas chainsaw massacre"" and ""halloween."" The reviewer said Friday the 13th ""succeeds where these others have failed"" because it does not attempt to ""unnecessarily"" develop the villain. We are just supposed to accept that Jason is a psychopathic killer and enjoy the ride. While this simple setup may work to some extent (Jason is terrifying in his mystery and his simplicity), this film not only doesn't develop Jason, it doesn't develop ANYTHING. There is no reason at all to care for any of the characters in this film. The filmmakers seem to have forgotten that a good film requires character development and substantive dialogue, even if it is the campiest of horror films. This film makes the aforementioned remakes (hills have eyes, Texas chainsaw massacre) look incredibly thoughtful, well-developed and, most important, enjoyable to watch. It feels like an incredibly long music video (true to Nispel's background) where it is impossible to relate to any of the characters on screen, let alone care about them when they are boringly and predictably dispatched by Jason (seriously, there are not even any great kill scenes). The film seems like a compilation of very bad sex, drug and death scenes, an approach which is nowhere near appealing even to a die-hard fan of exploitation films as myself. None of the key elements of successful horror films are present here, except maybe for Jason himself, who will definitely always be there to kill you (he will not be caught unawares or sleeping on the job). It is sad to see him come to this though. It is like watching a great older actor doing terrible movies and commercials. To reiterate, this film is a total failure...",Friday the 13th
503,afitoast,mediocre at best,6,13 February 2009,"Marcus Nispel's vision of Friday the 13th isn't BAD; it isn't GOOD either. in the fashion of 2003s The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, platinum dunes has taken a cherished horror franchise and re-imagined it for a new generation. as with TCM, all of the unintentional and macabre humor has been removed, and in its place is a darker and more realistic version of the original film. while i DO appreciate what is being done here visually and aesthetically, i do NOT appreciate the mainstream rock music and the ridiculously bad attempts to make the characters funny. this movies is basically in 3 parts; flashback 1, flashback 2, and present. now, i can understand having a flashback to explain the death of Pamela Vorhees, but jumping right into another one is pointless. it didn't work in part 4 and it doesn't work here. i also felt that this slasher film Truly lacked a plot. most critics pan slashers for this reason, but usually they're just not looking hard enough. in this case though, there is nothing going on but uncreative killing. as i watched the movie i felt myself staring at the screen andacting-4 story-3 music-2 violence-6",Friday the 13th

Jason's back for sure and they do justice to the original 3 films but it doesn't deliver as well as Texas chainsaw massacre or Halloween. This movie has no back story of Jason and it only has him on screen for the kills and a few cool camera shot's. Lets face it we don't go to see these remakes to see Jessica Biel or Jared Padalecki run from the bad guy, we wanna see the iconic killers go out and do what they do best and get a little bit of insight into why they are the way they are. So if your a fan of the 70's and 80's horror style movies this is all you but, if your a fan of a new style of horror with different twist and turns and character development then you will find Friday the 13th is lacking. In my book nispel is 1-1 with his horror icon remakes with Leather face beating out Jason. Hope it Helped.",Friday the 13th
505,zididane,A brilliant reboot of a series that has gone down hill in recent years,10,14 February 2009,"When I first heard that the Friday the 13th series was to be rebooted, like most people, I had my doubts (and initially I had not even intended to see it). However when I was brought to the theater by my close friends I was forced to eat my words, though admittedly not immediately. The early scenes of the movie were anti climactic to say the least, Jason's origins were rushed through to say the least with a brief though gruesome scene. As the movie progresses we are brought into seemingly the main plot, some traditionally comedic banter of drugs, and of course a gratuitous sex scene, which finally leads to the first, least dramatic death I have ever scene in a horror movie a brief chase followed by a black screen. At this moment the audience seems to sigh unanimously anticipating a failed attempt, however this first death is misleading. Not two minutes after we are led into some of the most brutal and fun deaths ever seen in the franchise, and we then find out that this more than satisfying brutality is merely the introduction. The audience applauds. The rest of the movie follows a similar plot as the initial series, but in a new and revitalized style. The jokes are funny, the sex is...gratuitous (and copious, but who can oppose that)and most importantly the murders are fantastic, unique, ironic brutal, completely fresh like nothing this series has done before. If one were to criticize this movie, they may say that it wasn't scary, in defense of this I could say look at ""Friday the 13th part one, pretty tame by today's standards,"" but this movie was not tame. No it may not have been scary, but who cares, none of the previous were really scary, more like cool cult movies. After some of the most intense and brutal murders I have ever seen (with out crossing the line of the modern ""gornography"" trend) and satisfying suspense humor and many traditional but successful plat tools and references, the audience is left with no choice but to scream, cheer and applaud as the credits begin to roll. This movie marks to me the possibility of a new generation of horror film, the classic feel of the slasher flick, with a new brutality, all while still being fun to and humorous. There is no doubt in my mind that this is going to be considered a new cult classic in the league of American Werewolf in London, Halloween, and of course the original series.",Friday the 13th
506,j-child247,A remake worth the money,8,23 February 2009,"Growing up in the 80's I was too young to go into the movies to see any of the Friday the 13th films and had to wait to get permission to see them on video! (yes video!)so this was the first time I got to see a big screen version of Friday the 13th. Jason Vorrhees on his own in all his glory!!! At first I went into the cinema thinking I hope it's not another crappy remake that should go straight to DVD. But I was actually surprised how good it was. The last time there was anything remotely decent to this was Freddy vs Jason which lets face it was more like ANightmare on Elm Street with special guest star Jason Voorhees.In the same vain as Rob Zombie's Halloween and the Texas Chainsaw Masacre, Friday the 13th has been given the work over for a modern remake on one of the more iconic films of the 80's horror movie genre. With a decent cast lead by Jared Padalecki better known as Sam Winchester from Supernatural and co-star Danielle Panabaker who co-stars as James Woods' daughter in Shark, Friday the 13th keeps all the jumps and scares and is able to pull it off without having to use gratuitous violence and gore like so many films that are being released under the genre of Horror movies these days. I got the impression that the film makers wanted the audience to have fun and be scared at the same time. Not walking out at the end of the movie feeling nauseas and depressed.The film retells the story of Jason Voorhes without having to re-invent him, but with a more modern adaption. There is the odd nude scene but it wouldn't be Friday the 13th without a few naked bodies and a hockey mask would it. But this doesn't take away the built up anxiety that the film creates so well that the previous films lacked. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone growing up in the 80's as well as anyone who would like to see a good horror movie. So when you go to see this try not to remember the 'Robocop - esc' Jason X, keep an open mind, sit back and enjoy the ride! I'll give this an 8 out of 10.",Friday the 13th
507,The_Condemned,Jason returns...yet he is the wrong one,6,11 March 2009,"Firstly I will say that I am a huge (excuse the pun...) Friday the 13th fan, even if the last couple of entries utterly sucked. Though I will excuse Freddy vs Jason, only just though.Anyways when I heard the legend himself was getting the ""reboot"" treatment I naturally nearly died as most hardcore fans did I'm sure. Well when the first trailer came out it looked pretty good and could have possibly worked and brought our favorite brain-challenged teen killer back to us, but alas we were all wrong.You would think that with this reboot treatment they would try to break the mold and not rely on cliché's and make it a carbon copy of the originals, but as it turns out they couldn't help themselves. They are all here my friends: the sex-starved blond, the know it all, the stoner, the token black guy, the random guy who serves no purpose, and the hero. This isn't so bad but the dribble they spewed was is just annoying pure and simple. Oh and one of gets taken by Jason because she looks like Jason's mother...yeah.Jason himself has had a slight make over too. Firstly he's still the huge intimidating brutal son of a four legged animal we all know and love, yet here lies the change. Jason has developed himself a nice IQ, a schizophrenic complex and has even built himself a series of underground tunnels, busy boy he has become. I don't know about you but I prefer Jason to be a slow, imposing and ultimately a indestructible mongoloid ala zombie Jason. Its not to say the new Jason is bad but he's no Kane Hodder type Jason. The best thing about this Jason is he was unbelievably savage, and I mean savage, he didn't screw around.The movie on the hole though was very well shot movie. Atmospheric from the start, has a nice gloss to it, and even has some nice suspense added to it which the last ones severely lacked. Its definitely not the best remake but certainly not the worst.",Friday the 13th
508,blackflag67,Is This A Remake?,2,17 March 2009,WTF? My belief here was this was a remake of the original 1980 film. What was interesting about the original was that it wasn't Jason doing all the killing but momma. However this is not the case in Friday 2009. No. In fact other than a rehash of the beheading scene from the first film this has nothing to do with that movie and it is quite apparent that Jason is doing the whacking right from the onset. As a matter of fact this film is nothing more than a jumping off point to start the whole series again(Sequels to the sequels). See Jason is tossed in the lake at the end and we all know that tossing Jason in the Lake is futile at best. Not sure what the motivation to make this movie actually was but this is a waste. Avoid.,Friday the 13th
509,davidbeckham1441,Excellent re-imagining of the franchise,8,6 April 2009,Awesome movie creepy one hell of a jolter and the ending rocked.Michael Bay did a great job as did Marcus Nispel. This movie was total atmosphere foreboding music very dark scenes and the best Jason ever:)The standouts in the film had to be Derek Mears who played Jason Jared Padellecki Amanda Righetti and Danielle Panabaker.It didn't necessarily has to be extremely graphic either to be enjoyable.The people behind this film have already stated that the DVD will be unrated so thats great news for gorehounds like me :)The twists that I will not give away were also surprising to me anyways.Plus the stereotypical characters were for a change funny and interesting.Not all of the characters though were as enjoyable Willa Fords character was wooden and dull as was the guy who portrayed her boyfriend in the movie.Plus certain things Jason does in this re-imagining make no sense.But this is a horror movie after all most of them don't make sense anyways lol.,Friday the 13th
510,cool_saham,Got What Expected And More,5,11 August 2009,"I went to watch this movies with no hopes of being awed or even satisfied but I was expecting a good time pass, guess it's still too much to expect from this movie...Lets divide the characters: Boys: All of them seems to have their brains hanging between there legs, they can only think of sex and oh yeah there was this guy who wore glasses and seemed a bit intelligent he can think of weed too. Girls: They seem to hate their clothes more than Jason itself. Jason: The best actor in the movies and mind you he was wearing a mask the whole time. I expected this movie to be bad but it exceeded my expectations and turned out to be the king of bad.....No plot turns, okay violence, over used ending and it seems that script was written by a drunken monkey.... If u wanna seem some good thriller/horror check out ""hills have eyes"" ""texas chainsaw massacre"" and even ""grindhouse""",Friday the 13th
511,gavinevans99,How to ruin someones childhood!,1,18 June 2009,"As a massive Friday 13th fan owning all of the previous DVDS, I looked forward to this movie after seeing a rather decent trailer. How wrong could i be.This film is awful. If it wasn't labelled as a Friday 13th movie then this would be on here rated as one of the worst movies ever made. Its not scary and it certainly isn't Friday 13th.The film makes such a promising start with a flask back aligning itself with the original Friday. Jason's mum being decapitated.Then it all goes wrong. The script it beyond awful with every cliché ever written chucked in for one. Sex and weed being introduced within minutes before a whole set of campers are dispatched one after the other in inventive kills! Hang on a minute, since when did Jason have a brain to hang someone in a sleeping bag so that they burned to death whilst also setting up a bear trap?! Then another piece of sacrilege, Jason runs. At this point, I concerned turning it off and quickly re-watching an earlier instalment.Anyone who loves Jason knows that this film is terrible. Marcus Nispel has to hold his hands up and say 'I've ruined on t he of the greatest horror characters' And now they have announced a part 2. A part 2 which comes out with an apology as to the first film being so bad. Just leave it alone please! As for remaking nightmare on elm street...don't get me started!!",Friday the 13th
512,Moviejediguy81,Money not moviegoers,3,20 September 2009,"Heres the thing, as one who knows and whatched every fday the 13th and enjoyed them, this was kinda a disappointment. Donfishies nice long comment but i don't know who you're trying to advertise in the movie business or maybe you had a part in making the movie. Renting this, (which I should have just gotten the free download from my buddy instead of paying 4.00, but he was at work and I was bored); I expected to have just fun and be entertained like the previous movies , except freddy vs jason. Some nudity(real breasts please) some really corny jokes, creative ways of dying, and funny things jason does. (whether by mistake or in the script). Instead its, f-bombs, really fake and inexperienced sex scenes bordering on porno,characters that are in a time warp between now and 30 years ago. Make them real as people are today, like they did when they made them 25-30 years ago. To be honest I kinda expected this in association with mike bay, keep to the special effects. To be honest halfway thru I clicked here and there to the last 15 minutes the ending. 3/10 because the lighting and effects were good and its Friday the 13th.:) sounds like a rant but you can only type so much in the comment without getting too detailed.",Friday the 13th
513,lars7774,Garbage,1,16 February 2009,"This movie was dreadful. I think it must be because the basic premise is bad -- the original wasn't any good, either. This was simply an excuse to show surgically-augmented breasts (I recoiled when the first girl took off her shirt, her tits looked that unnatural!) and splattery effects. I have to give it half a point for the way they combined the first three movies into the first 20 minutes, and I thought it was cute that, when we toured Jason's lair, there was a souvenir wheelchair up on the wall -- a subtle reference to Texas Chain Saw Massacre. I was in the bathroom afterwards when a group of 12-14 year-olds came in (don't ask me how they got tickets). The youngest said to his friends, ""That ending sucked."" Well, the whole movie sucked.....",Friday the 13th
514,HamiltonED,Best Jason Ever,10,15 February 2009,"This is the best horror movie I've seen. Watch it, you won't regret it.I hate remakes. This was not a remake... as many people have said. It is an homage to the first four movies, and it does an amazing job. I was tense through out the whole film. Not only was this movie thrilling but it was FUNNY! The cast was amazing all together. Amanda Rhegetti was phenomenal and beautiful as ever. But then again all the girls were gorgeous (note... a lot of nudity!). The guy who plays Trent, was BY FAR my favorite in the whole cast. This guy was the guy you loved to hate... the lovable ass, if you will. But its hard to play that role. Its easy to play an ass that you hate, a lot of actors over do it and you end up just hating them. But Travis really made you like him even though he was a d**k. THATS TALENT. He had me rolling on the floor laughing. He had some golden moments in that film and I hope his career really takes off because of it. Last but not least... Derek Mears. WOW. His take on Jason was insane. He was so good. The scariest Jason by far. I will watch this everyday this weekend (mainly cause i don't have a valentines date, but also because this movie was packed with suspense, fun, blood, gore, and sex. What a great combo! Great job to the whole cast and F13 team!",Friday the 13th
515,albertdahmen,Exactly What It Should Be,8,10 June 2015,"Alright, let's look at this film for what it is, and what it's supposed to be. It's a slasher film. That's all. And not only that, it's a JASON slasher film. And what are the four main elements we all want out of Jason movie? 1) We want a campy vibe. Check! We've got that. We've got kids in the woods smoking weed. Laughing. Setting up tents and camping. And it's all awesome. And what are the women doing? That's right. 2) Showing plenty of boobs. 3) We want a decent body count. This movie gives us that. In fact, the movie begins with teens getting done-in, in bloody fashion, and it takes up probably a good half hour of screen time. And these aren't even the main group of teens that we get to know throughout the movie. These are just more bodies, really. 4) Yes. We want Jason. I'm a huge fan of Jason, and when I watch a Jason movie I want to see Jason. Come on man, show me that mask. Well, this film does it. We get Jason by the truck load. And he looks awesome. So, with that in mind, what are the complaints? Not enough story? Who gives a damn? Not enough character development? Whatever. We're not watching The Shawshank Redemption, folks. It's just Jason. This is a movie that's designed to murder all but one or two of the characters that we follow for 90 some minutes. Let's try not to get too close to them. Instead, let's just enjoy the movie.",Friday the 13th
516,foreverDSY,Re-imaging with little imagination,5,22 July 2009,"From the pathetic opening scene (the once iconic Mrs. Vorhees being beheaded) to the you-knew-it-was-coming ending, this 're-imaging' stunk of mediocrity. If you've seen any of the previous 10 (and a half) 'Jason' movies, then you already know the formula; teenagers/young adults out looking for debauchery are slaughtered by a mad-man in a hockey mask. Change the names, update the clothing and slang, take away the charm and there you go-- you have F13'09.That said, if you're a slasher fan you can probably have some fun with this movie. What disappointed me more than anything was the complete lack of originality. They took the tried and true formula and churned out what may as well have been another sequel, instead of 're-imagining' anything at all.At the end of the day, it is what it is; another installment in a franchise that either needs some new ideas or just needs to be put down, like so many of Jason's young victims.",Friday the 13th

518,benpowell-27307,"Makes The Room, Drag Me To Hell and Battlefield Earth look like Oscar-winning material... This was AWFUL",1,22 February 2016,"This movie is a perfect example of how awful horror movies have become. In fact this movie was just plain terrible, It contains everything that most horror movies contain these days: extremely predictable story, an even more predictable ending, terrible acting, and LOTS of sex, which is completely irrelevant to the story. I like to call this combination ""The terrible horror movie recipe"". Fortunately there are still VERY rare gems in this genre (Insidious is a good example of this).Anyway, back to Friday The 13th. When I saw the name Michael Bay in the credits, I had a relatively strong feeling that this movie was going to be terrible. But I kept an open mind. Unfortunately, the movie was FAR worse than what I expected, and I stress the words ""FAR worse"". This movie was worse than ""Drag Me to Hell"", which received a lot of negative reviews from the movie-going public, ""The Room"" (Please don't get me started on that abomination) and ""Battlefield Earth"", often quoted as being one of the worst movies of all time. This movie definitely contained ""the terrible horror movie recipe"".I never thought I would say this about a horror movie, but there are more comic elements in this movie than there are scary ones. There are also a few aspects of the film I would like to mention. First of all, the acting. The actors were so unbelievably bad it isn't funny. Second, the characters themselves. None of them were likable, especially Trent. I was actually pleased when he was killed. Oh and they just had to include the dumb girl and the token black guy. Third, the sex. There was actually more sex in this movie then there was horror, and it was completely unnecessary. Fourth, the character of Jason himself. He does not run. AT ALL. He is a slow-moving killer, which is what makes him scary alongside his machete and hockey mask. Lastly, the predictability And I swear that a lot of the people who are giving this travesty of a movie good reviews are the types of people who enjoy movies just because of sex. Avoid like the plague.",Friday the 13th
519,tcm_fan,HUGE disappointment.,2,15 March 2009,"I am a fan of some T & A don't get me wrong, but not when thats the best part of the movie! The characters were bland and horribly represented this generation. I only like a few things about it. The death scene of the girl in the beginning where she is tied up in a sleeping bag and burned to death over the fire was quite original. I really didn't get much of a thrill from watching this though. The jump scenes were predictable and got annoying. There was no character development whatsoever. I didn't even care whether the people lived or died. AND THE ENDING! Oh God, the ending shines light on the fact that there might be a sequel! The economy's bad enough they shouldn't even think of wasting money on a second one of these. If you want to watch it, I suggest you wait till its on the free on fear-net or something.",Friday the 13th

But they have destroyed Jason as he is known and loved. Jason does not run after anyone, he just appears when you think you've escaped! Yet he spends half the movie running after his next kill. Jason does not keep someone alive, he kills and moves on to the next! Yet he kept this girl alive long enough for her brother to find her? Other than his mask, I would never recognize this forgery as the Jason I grew to love in the 80s and 90s. I was very disappointed in the movie, couldn't even bring myself to get through a second viewing, though I've re-watched the original series time and time again. They should have stayed true to the character, would have gone a long way for the movie.",Friday the 13th

The two things that prevented me from really liking the movie was the many holes in the storyline and the movie was not close to a remake. Camp crystal lake with electricity? Who made the underground trenches under the camp? You really expect us to believe it was a mine? When you simply title the movie as the same as the original, some expect a movie close to the original. This movie does not fit in with the series a bit ( I guess Jason X didn't either). Halloween by Rob Zombie was a remake, not this. It was fun to watch and for those hardcore fans, this will be somewhat satisfying.",Friday the 13th

523,JohnS-37,Remake???,4,25 January 2010,"First off, I'm lied too. This is not a remake. It's a reappearance of Jason killing people like he's been doing in the last 10 Friday the 13ths, excluding part 5 when it was a different killer. But how can this be called a remake. There a 2 minute clip at the beginning where Jason mom is fighting a camp counselor and is killed, then we jump ahead 30 years later and he's killing people. Ummmmmm, maybe the people who made the synopsis for this movie should watch the 1st and then watch this, they will see that this movie is not even similar to the first one. Different plot, different killer, different everything. It's not an up to date version of the original. Why not just call it Friday the 13th Part 12? Secondly, I was thinking, well with the freedom of starting the franchise over, they can do things correctly, give us a better idea of Jason's thinking. Well screw that, there's no thought process, he kills everyone that enters the movie as it progresses, except a nice little old lady and her dog. So it's basically a remake of part IV with Corey Feldman. Some teens come to the lake, he starts killing them one by one and bam. End Credits.They continues to use the same stupid clichés that the first few had. A classic barn scene, which I've never understood why we have a barn scene in every Jason. The fact that Jason is faster than anyone else, yet, he's bigger, and been a hermit in the woods, he's more athletic. Even thought the town of Crystal Lake has had the same sheriff forever, even though people went missing a month and half ago in the Camp. No officer comes across Jason in the investigation. But know, he's killing everyone after 30 years? This movie was just as bad as parts 2 and 4. 1 was great, 3 and 5 were good. At least in 5 Jason actually died and it's a copycat killer. Better than him coming back to life in every single one.Please spare me from any future Jason movies, and don't lie to me and say something is a remake when in reality, it's just another part of a pathetic series.Oh, not to be all glum about it, it did have some impressive kills in the movie. Deer antlers, Tow Truck, Sleeping Bag on fire. But seriously if you had put effort into this new opportunity, I think you could find that this movie could've done much better in the theaters.

Jason didn't seem like Jason, the acting was awful and the death scenes were nothing different to what we are all used to seeing.I have one major question and that is why remake this?

The jokes were great, it was like a comedy and a slasher film meet head to head and the comedy one out.

This remake was so bad I was so disappointed. Halloween Remake by Rob Zombie and the Nightmare on Elm Street remake were really really good Halloween 2007 remake was better than the original in my opinion Rob ZOmbie gave the background and a deep full backstory on Micheal Myers and how he became what he became. But Friday the 13th 2009 was just awful in every aspect there were a lot of good actors in it and they had so many Friday the 13th movies to obtain info from which is why it is so disappointing. In the original you can feel Pamela Vorhees anger and her sense of loss for her child and then her revenge to all the counselors, you also feel sorry for Jason. I did not feel anything in the remake except relief when it was over. That is and Hour and a half I wasted of my life and will never get back. SOmetimes you shouldn't stray from the original kinda like if it ain't broke don't fix it. If they came out with a second one to this I wouldn't see it if it was for free. I could go into detail about everything that is wrond with it but that would take way way too long. SO i will just say it was the worst most horrible remake I have ever seen.

529,mysterywriterii,New Friday a Mixed Bag,5,25 February 2009,"My name is Vince and I am a slasher junkie. I have been since 1978 and a masked man by the name of Michael Myers invaded the theater. When Jason came along two years later, I was a full blown addict. There is something visceral about the slasher movie.Whenever a Friday moves comes out, I am excited. It brings me back to my preteen years and I think that is the power of movies. This Friday, although I will never admit I don't like it, left me a little cold. My problem with this film lays squarely in the fact that I continued to ask myself questions throughout the film that I shouldn't have had to be asking myself. There seemed to be no reason for any of the second group of campers to be friends. None of them particularly cared for Trent and Trent didn't seem to particularly care for any of them. His girlfriend likes him so much that she runs off with a random stranger for the day, then when she gets back doesn't care that he is having sex with Bree. I know, people will say, she was distraught by the ordeal she had been through. I call BS. Any woman I have ever known, no matter what the circumstances would be all over him. And who is Bree? Where did he come from? Why is she even there? Who's friend is she that she gets invited to Trent's cabin. She doesn't seem to know anything about anyone else in the cabin. She is just randomly there to get naked and have sex with Trent after his girlfriend takes off with some guy? Also, when Clay lets Lawrence, I think that was his name, go look for Chewie by himself seemed out of character for Clay. You drag along some girl with you to look for your probably dead sister, but you let this guy go out alone knowing there is a masked killer hunting you. All I could think was what a wimp. And I didn't want to think that about Clay. I wanted to see him taking charge and protecting. These are questions that I shouldn't be thinking about during a horror movie. An audience needs to suspend their disbelief during these kind of movies, but not for basic questions like that. They should be able to suspend their disbelief about how did Jason get on the roof so fast or when did he become such a cracker shot archer.I dug the opening with Mrs. Vorhees. Like most, I would have liked to see more of that. Frankly, a whole movie of it. I liked how they changed the basic parameters where her rampage happens during the aftermath of her son's supposed drowning and not years after the fact. That makes more sense than the original. I also like Derek Mears' Jason. He was scary and intimidating. I liked Jared Padalecki as I did with most of the performances. I wish we would have gotten more of Ryan Hanson and Willa Ford as their dynamic seemed to be the best and most realistic and fun in the movie.The nudity was distracting. Willa Ford's was perhaps the least distracting. America Olivio's was done humorously, which was fine. The distracting part with her came with the simulated sex shown in shadow on the tent. It was a little too much for my taste. Easily the most distracting was the sex scene between Bree and Trent that seemed to go on for the entire third act of the film. It was excessive and although, Julianna Guill is beautiful, needed to be shorter, so we could get back to the horror film and not the stag film the movie started to turn into. It was an unnecessary device to make an already hated character, Trent, into an even more unlikeable character.",Friday the 13th

I was expecting a solid remake like the new ""Halloween"" which captured the disturbing vibe of the originals but with a different twist. Friday the 13th did not achieve this. It was a terrible remake. I wasn't the slightest bit uncomfortable, scared or on edge while watching. The kills weren't anything to write home about either. There are major plot holes and annoying characters.I even watched the ""extra features"" on the DVD after the movie to make sure I wasn't missing something. After watching the directors and producers talk about the movie and scenes I started to understand why it was so bad. They just didn't seem to ""get it"". And if they did they failed in putting it into the film. Jason and his tactics/movements are not scary in any way.

I own a scream park(large amusement park that consists of 5 different large haunted houses), and having seen just about every horror movie imaginable I have to say this was non the less predictable...except for the very brilliant opening which I won't give away...The entire movie theater cheered and clapped as soon as the title flashed onto the screen, and I knew at that moment that this was something to pay attention too.First things first, this isn't your regular Jason...He's gotten a few upgrades! He looks like he's had a few steroid injections and one of the most surprising and arguably most intimidating things is his new found ability to run....If a machete tooting mentally challenged angry 7 foot 300 pound hockey mask wearing man wasn't scary enough he can now out run you...of course he still retains his ability to teleport anywhere he wants to just show up.Like any great slasher film there is quite a bit of sex, gore, and drugs, but frankly I wouldn't have it any other way!...The reason I gave it an 8 is the predictability....My friend and I could tell exactly when every jump out moment would happen...and the ending could be seen for miles...There were also parts where the victims would be seen with no weapons and then the next scene they had a knife or an ax.The script is surprisingly well written...every line works, the humor is very good, and most of the death scenes are great...A few happen so fast that you don't really see what happens....This new and updated Jason has a very sadistic way of killing his victims and I loved every minute of it.If you see this movie (personally I think you should), go in the mind set that this is a slasher film....It does not try to be anything more or anything less and it succeeds rather well at it....Bring a date and enjoy yourselves....Because thats exactly what this movie sets out to do!",Friday the 13th
532,nonowto,"Utterly disgusting ""remake""",2,15 February 2009,"This was worse than I expected. Remakes generally screw everything up and this was nothing short of that. It was, actually, quite worse.Michael Bay did not fail on his producing level. When you watch a Michael Bay movie, you have to understand you're watching Hollywood at it's best. Although many of his movies that he produced are not so bad, and are needed for the Hollywood feel, this movie is not meant for Hollywood. His specialty is blowing things up, so stick with Armageddon & Pearl Harbor, Michael. The only horror movie that was close to the original that Michael Bay has ever done was Amityville Horror. That should've been his one and only.Next, the director of this movie was also the director of the remake of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which was also Michael Bay produced). He does not hide that he directed the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, either. Friday the 13th has the same mood setting, the same lighting, the same shots, the same feel as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake.There is virtually NO difference than the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and the Friday the 13th remake.They turned a b horror movie series, which was arguably an outstanding series, and turned it into a mainstream movie. There is a lot of drugs, drinking, and sex in this movie. Just like the typical slasher film. Despite what some say, this movie does NOT give respect to all of the other movies. It's disgusting and utterly horrible.P.S. watch Behind The Mask before you watch this movie. I feel like whoever wrote the movie, watched Behind The Mask and copied it to a tee.From the wood chipper to the apple cider to the two stoned idiots who go check out the shed.Do yourself a favor in fact, save yourself 10 bucks and go watch Behind The Mask, a far superior movie.",Friday the 13th
533,SleazyMartinez,"Nice Horror movie, no Friday 13th",5,26 February 2009,"I recently saw all the old Friday 13th movies from Part I to Part X and really loved them. In part because it was always the same routine. You got your bunch of teenagers going to crystal lake, having sex, smoking pot and finally one by one gets killed in a lot of different ways by the hockey mask wearing maniac Jason. All teenagers are stereotypes of every kind. Black kid, white cheerleader slut, jocks, sensitive guy and lovable yet shy girl, usually the main character. You knew what you could expect and yet you always watched, got scared and laughed. The kills, though at some points quite gory (Part IX) where never too brutal in their visualization and for the most part you knew what was going to happen next. Summary: I loved the movies and especially Jason.So I watched this movie expecting good things. Marcus Nispel already directed Texas Chainsaw Massacre and I found it to be quite frightening. Although I never watched the old ones, so I can't compare.Friday starts quite good. Teens are walking through the woods on search for dope. Nerd has a GPS, the others have girlfriends, which they eventually bang in there tents, because they decided to spend the night there. Nerd has no sex, so he wants dope. Wanders off and you might guess what happens.From here on it's just killing. Second group of teenagers come to Crystal Lake, because the dad of one owns a house there and they meet another kid, that's there for reasons that cannot be revealed without using major spoiler. You WILL be surprised.Well can't say much more to the story. It's a horror movie, so people die.What I liked: Plenty of kills, sometimes very brutal. Plays mostly at night, can be frightening and it's got suspenseful moments. High boob count. You will see lots of naked chicks in there. I liked that for the obvious reason ;-) and also because there they really hit it. All the old Jason movies hat lots of completely meaningless nudity. Just kids having sex all the time, that's why Jason died, so they gotta go on, he he. Just reminded me, that this movie was called Friday the 13thWhat I didn't like: As you might see from my last sentence, there was very little that was actually in concordance with the old movies. They wanted to cram the first four titles into this new one, which they couldn't really pull of. Jason wears a sack, the hockey mask and even Mrs. Vorhees is there. Some people criticize that Jason is running. Was not a big deal for me, but if you don't like that, it is for you. There is one kill that the old Jason would never have done. It's more like torturing to death. Won't say which one, but you'll figure it out. Plus the huge plot twist in the middle just felt wrong. In conclusion: If you have never seen a Friday movie, or at least not the first 4, then go see this. It's an okay done horror flick that will certainly entertain for 1.5 hours. If you liked the old movies and especially the old Jason, then I leave it to you to see it. But if you do, then prepare to be entertained but also very disappointed at Jason. He is not the same and the movies don't feel the same as the old ones did. This is just a guy killing lots of people and he certainly isn't Jason only because he wears a hockey mask. This movie is more like Texas Chainsaw massacre with a different killer and more nudity. Fells kinda the same.5 out of 10 because it entertained. Not more, because it's not a remake in my opinion. They redid it.",Friday the 13th
534,thomfrosts_pam,OK but allot of what made Friday the 13th was left out *** Contains Spoilers***,6,14 February 2009,"Don't read this if you haven't seen the movie.OK what I found wrong with this movie: Jason wore a bag over his head for most of the movie. No ch ch ch ha ha ha sounds only heard it 2 times.In the original 13's they would stab or what not and think they killed Jason but this only happened at the end of the movie.Now what I found OK with this movie: If you take this movie on its own and not as an established franchise it was not bad. Lots of killings and nude woman in this movie.If your a Friday the 13th purest like me you might walk away disappointed. If you ignore all you know about the Friday the 13th franchise like this writer director did then its not that bad of a movie.In the original Friday the 13th's there was that cartoon'ie death and destruction, this has none of that. It's like the writer and director looked at the old one's and said how can we mess up this franchise. This movie will do good the first week or so until the word gets out.If you go to watch this do not expect a Friday the 13th movie, its a good slasher movie but its not really a Friday the 13th movie.",Friday the 13th
535,lextreme27,Watch the extended version!!,5,5 June 2009,"I know many fans were disappointed by the 2009 rip-off, as a fan of the original series, I didn't feel like if the movie had the right environment, they just gave it the typical clichés in every horror movie.However i was recently surprised with the extended version of DVD, I had the opportunity to buy it earlier, but I can assure you I'll want to watch the extended version, I am not saying that is amazing or It will blow away, no it won't, but at least we can see for ourselves, what could have been more successful if it had been released in theaters.",Friday the 13th
536,channibal22,Stupendous?,6,14 February 2009,"I was looking forward to seeing this film, having watched and enjoyed all of the old Friday the 13th movies...including Jason X! And to be honest, it wasn't that bad! It had all the factors which make a Jason film great- cheesy acting, good amounts of gore, scenes which make you jump, 'lets check this old creepy derelict building' scenarios, a few funny moments and of course the token classic nude scenes! Of course its not a horror classic, but does the best it can with what it has. The film was an instant hit for me anyway, as it had both sack and hockey mask Jason! Plus it was refreshing to see the big man running around for a change! I would definitely go to see this if you are a Friday 13th fan, or even if you've never seen them before, also like another review said on here, it would make a decent date movie. It isn't really that scary but should make you jump and flinch through out, but don't go if you are expecting a no-nonsense slasher film or even an attempt to make the series more darker or in a way..more serious. I really liked this remake though, and would give it a healthy 6.5 hockey masks out of 10!",Friday the 13th
537,JohnnyFlyTrap,"One part remake, one part sequel, one part re-invention",8,17 February 2009,"Unless you are a die-hard fan of the Friday the 13th series, you shouldn't even try to review this film. Simply put, the movie wasn't made for you and unless you've been on Jason's ride before, it will be all but impossible for you to pick up on all of the subtle nuances and tributes within the flick.But I am a horror movie fiend and this movie had me from the opening scene. Many of the tricks, kills, etc. were stolen from past Friday the 13th films, but they were no less effective seeing them played out the second time around. Derek Mears not only aptly dons the hockey mask, but adds a certain emotionality to the character as well - one that has our ""hero"" not guided by an anonymous force, but hell bent on vengeance.While it's by no means a perfect film, at least, for once, a horror franchise has been revived in a suitable way that satisfies genre geeks and newbies alike.",Friday the 13th
538,davids-1998,Perfect Remake!,10,15 February 2009,This is the greatest movie you will ever see! I can almost guarantee you will love it! It was the best remake I'd ever seen. It's a better version of the first one and not only is the overall thing better but the effects are much better too making it much scarier than the first one. Though the first one was good I didn't like the fact that they didn't show Jason and there wasn't even a hockey mask killer in it. I would definitely recommend this movie to people ages 10-25. It's good and jumpy but it won't kill you. It didn't give me any nightmare but I would be warned if you're taking a younger audience. Other than that most people would probably like not only because it's scary but because it has a really good plot that I thoroughly enjoyed.,Friday the 13th

But still there were some good laughs along the way and it did make me jump a couple of time...although every time a person was alone, you immediately knew what was going to happen... the ending also for me was pretty poor...i mean how could he generate so much power from within the water to smash through wood...i know it is fiction but still...also what kinda baffles me is that why didn't the brother and sister just push Jason in the machine thing where he would be crushed and minced rather than going through all the hard work of taking the chain of his neck, putting him in a bag, taking his mask off than getting him down to the river to drop him in...just doesn't make sense...you just use your common sense and think back to where he came alive once before when he was drowned in a river... well thats horror films for you i suppose :)",Friday the 13th

While the plot was suspect the movie stayed true to the franchises roots which are SEX, WEED, and DEATH. Though I did think the sex scene towards the end was a little much, but overall I was satisfied with the movie. Easily the best one since parts 1-4. I couldn't help but walk away after the movie wishing for more but hey thats the horror genre for ya. I'll give it a solid 7/10 if I'm comparing it to the other movies of the franchise. I'd rather watch this any day over Rob Zombies remake of Halloween. Hopefully this move Friday the 13th will be a good spring board for more sequels in the near future.",Friday the 13th

I was scared going to see this remake since I knew no one no how could remake the original. That said, I just watched it and enjoyed it. I did not compare it to the original. Its just another addition to a great film franchise. I never care what they do send him to Manhattan (for 10 min), put him in space, or send him to hell. Just glad Jason is still killing. Thanks to Michael Bay hopefully Friday can get a new jolt for a new generation and we will see many many more (fingers crossed.) The movie itself had some pretty good kills. Jason uses his favorite weapons an ax, bow and arrow, and of course his machete. There is one thing that confused me, what was with all the masturbation? I didn't really understand all that. The scene with Bree and what ever that guys name was in the bed was too funny. Probably the best sex scene out of any of the Fridays.",Friday the 13th

You can tell what type of people will be the first to die. The characters seem unrealistic. There is so much unnecessary nudity. If you are just looking for that, perhaps you have a chance of enjoying the movie. Every moment I sat through it, I was hoping it would end. We all knew who would make it out alive. I never plan on watching any other Friday the 13th movies again.A group of people go to the town where Jason lives and decide to camp out there; none of them make it back home. A brother of one of the girls that was in that group decides to go out in search of her. Then he encounters another group of people that are coming to stay at a house nearby where the other group had gone camping. One of the girls in this new group starts taking an interest in him, the brother of the missing girl. The killer, Jason, too, starts taking an interest in this new group that's disturbing his surroundings somehow.1/10",Friday the 13th

This movie rocks. Jason is a fierce killer. no one can run from him. A lot of nudity, creative deaths, terrors, suspense, over average act, and good music made this movie a MUST SEE movie! Forget Jason goes to hell, Jason X and all old story, this is a respectfully brand new one. Marcus Nispel made a good movie a lot far better than ""texas chainsaw Massacre"".

It has the fun slashing of teenagers that are doing drugs and having sex just like the rest of the films in this series. this movie also has a couple new elements that i really enjoyed. i hope that this film was successful enough for the companies and liked enough by fans to make another one. it deserves a sequel! if you truly give this movie a chance, you won't be disappointed. 7/10 seems like a good rating for this movie!",Friday the 13th

Only thing i would say was i thought Jason was killed a little to easy, i mean throughout the entire movie jason was slaughtering everyone and no-one even stood a chance of hitting him, then in the last 15 minutes one guy seems to hit him and then the whole death scene begins! Was a little too fast, he seems way invincible throughout then this?!? I really cannot wait for the DVD and hopefully Friday the 13th part 2!!!!!!!! Im no glad to see a decent SCARY horror in cinemas instead of them ridiculous Saw style films, blood and guts ain't scary...they are just not realistic either. You can believe in Jason...or some phsycopath, next time i stay in a log cabin in the woods im making sure the windows are dead locked ha.

I was tense through out the whole film. Not only was this movie thrilling but it was FUNNY! The cast was amazing all together. Amanda Rhegetti was phenomenal and beautiful as ever. But then again all the girls were gorgeous (note... a lot of nudity!). The guy who plays Trent, was BY FAR my favorite in the whole cast. This guy was the guy you loved to hate... the lovable ass, if you will. But its hard to play that role. Its easy to play an ass that you hate, a lot of actors over do it and you end up just hating them. But Travis really made you like him even though he was a d**k. THATS TALENT. He had me rolling on the floor laughing. He had some golden moments in that film and I hope his career really takes off because of it. Last but not least... Derek Mears. WOW. His take on Jason was insane. He was so good. The scariest Jason by far. I will watch this everyday this weekend (mainly cause i don't have a valentines date, but also because this movie was packed with suspense, fun, blood, gore, and sex. What a great combo!

549,bklynbuddha,It was OKAY,6,15 February 2009,"First let me state that I'm a total Friday the 13th fan (specifically the first 4 - not a fan of the rest). At any rate, I went to the movies and saw the first one back in the 80's and have been a fan since.Being a fan of the first 4 I had big expectations going into the theater this past Friday. After all this is supposed a condensed re-imagining of the first four movies. I like the touch of part 4 with the big brother looking for his sister. I also liked barn scenes reminiscent of part 3. I also got into whole ""she looks like Jason's mother"" shtick from part 2. I just wished they spent a little more time with Mrs. Voorhees (part 1).At the end of it all I was a quite disappointed. There were some great scenes. The acting was better than expected. The kills were okay with a little re-imagining of mother's and Jason's original handy work. My problem was that I thought it was a bit too ""glossy-hollywood"" type ""horror"". I like my horror movies edgy, dark, brutal, and not too ""jokey"" or funny. You also don't really learn anything more about Jason at all (a la Rob Zombies Halloween - not that it was the greatest film either).I realized afterward that I went into this expecting a little too much. I was expecting to be blown away like I did back in the 80's when the first Friday movies were released. I decided to go back and see it again without looking for specific elements and...It wasn't as bad as I initially thought. I still think there should have been a little bit more insight into Jason as a child. I still think think that there should have been more of Mrs. Voorhees. However, on it's own it's not that bad.If you've never seen Friday the 13th when it was a ""new"" phenomenon then this movie will be an exciting and new experience. If you are an original 1980's Friday the 13th fan, leave expectations at the door and just enjoy this movie for what it is.It was OKAY!",Friday the 13th

It was very poorly acted also. Their is no one in this world who would enjoy this movie, not even fans of the Friday the 13th franchise. I think this movie was just a quick money grab by Michael Bay ( he was the producer for this movie) and Marcus Nispel (the Director) who is no stranger to terrible films. I give this movie an F their are many bad horror movies I'm sorry to say but this is the worst one I have seen. This is a terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible film.

But that's it, super bland, tedious acting with amazingly stupid dialogue and lots of boobs. To be completely honest, this is a scary version of the worst movie of all time ""the room"". At least when I watch ""Birdemic"" I can laugh the soul out of me, but this movie brings nothing! nothing at all! It was made just to shows how good the actresses's boobs are. I shouldn't be expecting much, instead, I shouldn't even watch the trailer.

553,DJ-Evolva,Jason Hood vs Model Agency,4,16 February 2009,"This is a awful movie. Another teenager movie but this time with Jason.This movie is full of bad jokes, poor writing and very poor imagination. The ones from the 80's are far better than this one.The girls in this movie serve two purpose only: They are there to show their body and to show some sex scenes. The guys look like Ken (Barbies boyfriend) and came straight from the model agency. The only thing that matters is that they look good on film. No one cares if they can't perform. Obviously the director didn't care.And what about Jason? Well, Jason had some evolution. He can use a bow and arrow now becoming Jason Hood. He runs (wich is fine) and he looks at himself in the mirror (even Jason cares about looks now). Oh and for some reason he can travel at light speed because he changes from place to place so goddamn fast.This isn't a horror movie. Its a comedy with some gore (not too much). I was hoping to see a remake with the quality of Halloween (from Rob Zombie) but this is even worse than Freddy vs. Jason (and that one is really bad).And please! If any director is reading this. Please!!! Avoid the stupid racial and teenager jokes. No one cares about them and they ruin the whole movie feeling.I gave it a 4 for 2 reasons only: Jason is back and he keeps doing is stuff.Avoid this movie if you can.

554,th3-voice,"Just as you'd expect, except actually quite good",7,2 August 2009,"The formula is as one has come to expect... young people get butchered in suitably impressive ways for daring to have sex, use drugs, or doing any of the other things which gets you killed in slasher flicks.Now, realize that the ""Friday the 13th"" films have long since degenerated into parodies of themselves. The series started pretty well, the first few films were variations on the ""psycho killer"" theme with just a tiny hint of supernatural tones sneaking in... Jason was always strong, fast and supremely deadly in varied ways, but for a while he could just about pass as human... later in the series, he is clearly far beyond any normal, or indeed abnormal, human. Pairing the late-in-series Jason up with Freddy Krueger was a good match (and another film that was surprisingly enjoyable).This film takes the entire franchise in a slightly different direction, and returns Jason to the role of supremely strong, fast, stealthy and seemingly impervious to pain, but nonetheless human. It seems to reboot the entire continuity, which appears to be a popular trend with old franchises these days.Are the characters believable? Not very. Everyone is a walking stereotype. The plot is cookie cutter; you will not be surprised. In fact, I can't point to a single outstanding feature of this film.And yet, there's something to it. I can't really say it any better than this: it was worth my time to watch it. There were several startling moments, everything just... WORKED.

Yes it is your typical American teen movie but it's got something about it that I really liked and i thought the acting was pretty good to. In some horrors for some reason the acting isn't great and it ruins the film a bit but not in the film. Although I have to admit I haven't been the orginals so maybe I think it's good because I haven't seen the orginals, but in my personal opinion you like gore and a weirdo in a mask killing teenagers in creepy ways and torturing them then I think you'll really like it.",Friday the 13th

Like both the Texas Chainsaw Massacre redo's, Zombie's brilliant version of Halloween, Horror turned action film The Hitcher, and now we have a wonderful rendition of Friday The 13th. Jason is beast in this movie instead having the poor damsel in distress run far away from Jason and him suddenly appear in front of her he chases after them and gets them himself.

It is hard to watch and not compare with the original series but overall i think the director pulled it off. The intro was great as we watched mommy and then Jason get right to work. I agree with the other posts that we could have seen a little more gore. We now realize how great a makeup guy Tom Savini truly is. It was also good to see some fresh faces and not the typical young Hollywood superstars or musicians. I was hoping to see an ending like the original part 3 but i keep forgetting this is a new and original take on that series.

562,demifreak,A Letdown For Genre Fans. A Lazy Attempt at a Sequel.,3,16 February 2009,"Spoilers ahead: Never thought I would say it, but this movie is a failure.Aside from Jared Padalecki and Amanda Righetti's strong performances the rest of the cast was very amateur and clichéd. The acting was awful and the roles were embarrassing. Danielle Pannabaker tripped through the movie with a slack look on her face the whole time as though she was bored to be there. The rest were so amateur I hardly believed them to have have ever touched marijuana or had sex before in their lives. I understand having a roundabout cast for appeal purposes (or more realistically PC purposes), but when you have the only African American character calling out his very existence in the movie, it is sad. For example: ""You are going to have me pump gas because I am the only black guy here!?"" A smart audience does not question nor care that there is one black man with a mostly white cast. I feel that the stereotypes in these current movies are too over the top. Cringe worthy.The marijuana subplot was ridiculous. Let's have massive amounts of herb growing around Camp Crystal Lake, because God forbid teenagers might actually want to go plain, old camping and not need a reason like getting high the whole time! Overkill. All the screen time with the bong was lame. The writers really take their audience for a bunch of morons.Considering the atmosphere of Friday the 13th (2009), you could tell we were on a set. Running in and out of the camp, with the sign overhead felt like it was some kind of amusement park! The setting was extremely one dimensional and the props made a mess of scenery. I'm sorry but Jason Voorhees does NOT collect trinkets! And for someone so obsessed with their mother, his shrine to her would have been a little more dramatic and not stuffed in the bathroom wall! This oozed Marcus Nispel's other remake The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and he should have went with another set designer and filmed somewhere other then Texas.Jason runs (a lot). A lot of people thought this to be odd. Big deal. He went the distance in Part 2. I honestly do not have any complaints about his look or performance. The filmmakers tried to put their stamp his character and have him turn lights on and seem ""more human."" Why try to fix something that is not broken. The new Jason was brutal, as should be. Even though I thought his kills fell short.Yes the kills were not exciting. I would have rather seen Jason use the same weapon over and over if he did it creatively! Instead he is using bow and arrows, poking people through floorboards! Very disappointing. It should have been more creative, more gory AND more brutal. It's a shame that for the hard R rating, the focus was on breasts and drug usage and not Friday the 13th's signature death sequences.One other thing. How Jason stumbles across a size extra large hockey mask and decides to put it on was laughable out loud!",Friday the 13th

The girl who played Jenna was really cute, too bad she didn't have a sex scene. Overall it was awesome movie. Kind of bullshit that Jason couldn't die. When Clay's fine sister stabbed Jason in the chest I was thinking ""Die and please don't come back for part"". Jason coming back to live from the dead at the last scene was lame. I guess he'll keep on coming back again and again and again just like the previous Friday The 13th movies. This is not the movie to take your kids to. Too much hot nudity and too violent. Really bloody movie. What better to watch on Friday the 13th than Friday the 13th! I think this movie really made some of the female cast in the movie more popular. Really, all the girls were hot. I don't know what else to say. I guess everyone in the movie dies except Jason. Jason must be like an alien or something. How could he not die?

I mean hes deformed, obviously retarded, and yet he can still sneak around like a ghost in the night, i don't think so. Just kill him off and be done with him.

It was pretty obvious that he was going to kill the girl in the water from above when she thinks that he's gone. duh... My biggest issue is how was the missing girl just stuck down in jason's dungeon for 6 months. So for 6 months she's wearing the same clothes, having menstrual cycles, using the restroom right there in those same jeans. Her brother and the cops wouldn't need a search party because they would have smelled her a mile away with 6 months and no water on her. Are you kidding me? Or maybe Jason provided her with her feminine products and allowed her to go the restroom and cooked her some food so that she could survive all that time. Yeah right. There is nothing memorable about any of the murders because they've all been seen before. I think they should have thought up some new ideas and had him being a little more crafty. While I will say that he moved fast in this movie unlike the original where you always wondered how the hell he caught up with people running when he was walking.

This sets up the final ""gotcha"" as he jumps up through the dock to ""scare"" us a final time.I know the first thing I want to do after killing the killer is to dispose of his body, thus destroying evidence that he existed, making myself look guilty. Are the writers too darn lazy to come up with a death scene that would have found him missing in the water other than the way it happened?

The movie was great despite the over-sex, but Friday the 13th is known for that, if you are going to nark on this movie for that then watch the others, it is almost tradition, because that is WHY JASON ALLEGEDLY DIED (WHICH I Believe HE DID AND HE IS UNDEAD, NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO HE COMES BACK) BUT THE STORY IS JASON DROWNED Because THE COUNSELORS THAT WERE TO WATHC HIM LEFT AND WENT AND WERE HAVING SEX THAT RIOGHT THERE IS WHY THERE IS SEX IN THE MOVIES, Jason ""died"" because teens were having sex, its a staple to the series. They took the pillow case (II)They showed briefly the wheelchair that was in the first one that one of the victims was in.They had a bus which if I'm not mistaken was in one of themThe end was based off the first movie, Jason jumping out of the water. There were a lot of good things about this movie it was a very good movie, the deaths were innovative, and slightly funny.It was a great movie so stop punching this movie into the ground for what ever reason, it was a great teen slasher movie that I would almost pay the 950 to go see again, but Im going to wait to get it on DVD so I can watch more that once.",Friday the 13th

Honestly, I really liked it, there were some really cool kills, Jasons look was pretty awesome, and they used some old themes from Friday the 13th movies as inspiration, and there's a lot more. Yes there were some flaws but they weren't that big. Also most of the characters were dislikable but you're supposed to root against them you want Jason to kill them, so it works.

573,alissatron,Moral of the story: Mess with Jason's grow-op and you die.,6,15 February 2009,"As a fan of the original Friday the 13th series and horror movies in general I saw it as a necessity to see this movie opening weekend. At first I was excited, I grew up watching horror movies and I was so looking forward to closing the generation gap and seeing a Friday the 13th movies in theaters. It seemed like it had promise, the same people as Texas Chain Saw Massacre, produced by Micheal Bay strong opening scene.. you expect that they wouldn't dare butcher a beloved series. Well if this is what you were hoping for you are wrong. For some reason the movie is very centralized around marijuana and if you mess around with Jason's stash or even smoke weed you're the first to go. I don't know if it's supposed to relate to a younger generation or be an anti drug ad jammed into a movie, but anyways I didn't really get the relevance to the story and I thought that inclusion was pointless. Secondly for some reason they decided to humanize Jason.. really humanize him, showing anger and even somehow being capable of rigging an underground bell security system. The original Jason is one step above Zombie for motor skills. You don't wonder how he feels what he eats or why he does certain things because he just is. He's not human. Why does he keep Whitney except for to keep the plot going? If we think back to the original series when someone pretended to be his mother, it ended horrible for the girl. Just a mess. Really. Also as others mentioned overdoing of TNA..this didn't bother me, I mean a 18A slasher. That's fine. What are you going in thinking you're going in to see if not some boobs and sex scenes. But where the was the gore? Seriously. Tell me. I was expecting bloody brutal killing radiating in awesomeness. Doing things that the original storytellers would have only wish they had the effects for. But alas..again a let down. Really disappointing, there's so many holes that I'm not even going to touch. It was sort of entertaining, but they totally butchered the story, the cinematography sucked and they tried to apply the same humanizing rules as they did with Texas Chain Saw Massacre.

There is no build-up, the night scenes are too dark, and one question remains...why did he not kill Whitney when he was coming down on her with his machete? And his Rambo-esquire kill shot with the arrow was totally out of character.You had your nude bodies, your death of those who had sex, your woman in the water. What you didn't have was the tension, the anticipation, and the surprise that you had with the original franchise.I actually dozed off during the movie.

575,ayomitch5391,Best MADE Slasher I've seen...but it's still a Slasher,7,26 February 2009,"To be honest, I don't like horror movies. At all. But slasher movies have a special place in my movie heart for some odd reason. I love slashers. I guess it's the perfect balance of scares and laughs. Friday the 13th (2009) was just that. While it was not the best slasher I've ever seen, which would be Halloween (1978), it was the best made. This film had to budget it needed to be immerse and effective. The plot was pretty creative for a slasher and the movie's storyline runs through Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the original series. The first 15-20 minutes, as many of you may have heard, is awesome and worth the price of admission. Past that we see nothing really new besides better film quality and a quicker and smarter Jason. There is A LOT of unnecessary nudity in this one as well, but it adds that campy element that a lot of slashers had. the problem with that is that with a decent budget, you don't have to result to nudity to make up for lack of story and/or effects. the effects in the movie were pretty good and the kills didn't seem repetitive. The acting was decent, especially Chewie which i'll get to in a second. The others were pretty forgettable. One thing this movie had, as many before it did, was one liners. and a lot of them! There are some laugh out loud moments in this movie and the character Chewie will really get you laughing at times. All in all, if you're looking for a decent, 21st century slasher, Friday the 13th is your ticket. And if you are a fan of the originals, see this one. Because if you're a fan, the ending will make you smile. But as far as horror that will scare you to death, this one isn't it.",Friday the 13th

TERRIBLE. you could swap the killers and you wouldn't know the difference. i didn't need Jason to have an underground dwelling. he doesn't look into mirrors to see if hes terrifying. and he certainly doesn't take hostages. i don't need a humanized back story for Michael Myers to make me understand why he does what he does. these guys are monsters just like Godzilla and Dracula. they are evil incarnate...revenge personified. guys like Zombie have stripped all that was terrifying and mysterious and built them up to be more human and painted them to look more like Leatherface. water the classics down for todays audience. apparently we have all become psycho-analysts and we need to understand why these monsters are brutal killers, to know how they live. that and why their masks are so dirty they look more and more like skin stitched together...ill take the originals any time, thx.",Friday the 13th

Pam V. only gets a whopping 1 or 2 min of screen time. I guess with that in tow, we'll never meet his dad, how he was conceived (what kind of man does Mrs. Voorhees let in her bed anyways?), we'll never know his emotional significance of growing up in the wilderness alone, did he try to connect/rebel, etc. Tom Foolery's review on here probably puts it best so read his for more detail on the film's drawbacks.On the positive side there were some nice boobs and nudity in the film, and it was at least better executed (no pun intended) than parts 6 thru 10 (though 10 story wise is probably more entertaining).In summary: Like TCM, not anywhere as good or creepy as the original (or in the case parts 1 thru 4) BUT better than latter day sequels.

This is more of a re-imagining, similar to Rob Zombie's Halloween.This movie has all of what the mainstream audience wants; sex, drugs, alcohol, partying, nudity, dirty humor, cell phones, etc. The audience ate it up. The characters, except for Clay, Jenna and Whitney, are the typical, dumb teens that want to party and don't give a hoot for what the others have to say. I couldn't wait for Jason to get his hands on them, but when he did, I wanted more. The gore department was definitely lacking in creativity and blood, and as this is a slasher film, it didn't feel like it. The story wasn't bad, but there was no flow and they kept adding more and more. The only part I did like was the very last scene, even though it was predictable. As a fan of the Friday the 13th series since a young age, I feel insulted and cheated in a way.

581,pk9696,"Unbelievably bad reboot, or whatever they're calling it.....",2,24 May 2009,"This ""reimagining"" was certainly not the worst in the series (that honor, in my opinion, goes to Jason Goes To Hell), but it was far from the best or even what it could have been. To be honest, it barely feels like it even belongs in the series.Ever since I heard that Paramount was going to be on board and that that would give the producers rights to ANYTHING from the original films in the series, I was more pumped for this movie than just about anything I've ever seen. I love this series more than I like the Halloween, TCM, and Nightmare on Elm Street series, or even the sequel-less and underrated Black Christmas. That said, the anticipation was killing me and I had very high expectations, especially since I loved what Platinum Dunes did with Amityville and the two TCM's (loved the prequel to that one).Here are just some of the questions I was asking myself when I left the theater. First and foremost, where was Manfredini's score? I like what Jablonsky did with TCM and Amityville, but he phoned this one in. I thought Rob Zombie's remake of Halloween was OK, but it wouldn't have been a Halloween movie at all without the original score..and this barely felt like a Friday The 13th with Manfredini's music left out.And what was up with the opening scene with Mrs. Voorhees? I know the Friday stories by heart and even I had hard time understanding what exactly that was setting up, so I can only imagine others, especially newbies to the series, took from it. You can't cram the original movie into a 5 minute opening credit sequence!! Or how about how Jason takes a hostage and chains her up in the his basement? A basement with lights on? Since when does he kidnap and take prisoners? And who the f**k pays his electric bill every month? Who wired up all the lights outside his house that he turns on when he hears the two characters on his property???? Jason has never used a light! He's supposed to be a retarded mongoloid! Talk about leaving suspension of disbelief checked at the theater door before you see this flick! And how anticlimactic was finding the hockey mask? It was almost like the script would have read, ""Whoops! What's this?!"" And then he admires himself in the mirror?? BTW, the dialogue in this scene that the redneck (a redneck in NJ that is) has with the mannequin was downright embarrassing. ""Hey baby, you remember the night you took my virginity?"" Come on! And where was the ""KIL KIL MA MA"" sound? I think it was played once in the beginning and once at the end! And why did the survivors find it necessary to bring Jason's body down to the lake after his head was in the wood chipper? Obviously, the real answer is that's how the writers wanted to set up the sequel, but for God's sake, talk about a lazy way to make that happen! Even the wood chipper scene was weak.And how about the fact that Jason is always down for the count one, two, even three times before he's finally stopped at the end of each movie. That, too, was missing in this one. This movie would have been decent as a stand alone horror flick, but it reminded me more of a TCM movie with Leatherface sans chainsaw and wearing Jason's mask. I think Mears did a good job as Jason, but Kane Hodder has always been my favorite even though he wasn't in the series when it was still good (Part 7 was decent, I guess). Hodder just made Jason look literally unstoppable.Lastly, the script itself was just pretty weak. Marcus has gone on record saying this film was written just before the writer's strike began, and that no rewrites were performed. It shows. Nispel is a good director, and could have done better with much better source material. I'm not looking for a lot of character development, but I could have cared less for these people. The pot sh*t was just in there for the younger generation who smoke weed to poke and prod each other and start whooping in the theater every time it was shown or mentioned. The nudity was overdone, though the girls were hot as hell. The dialogue left much to be desired. The jokes were way too forced (not every character needs to be funny!), and I guess I just really wanted it to take place at a camp with counselors like parts 1, 2 and 6.Here's to hoping they dump Shannon and Swift, who did good with FvJ, but are far from the fans they claim they are of the first four films if this is the best they can do. These are the same guys that said only the first four films in the series are the good ones, and yet the garbage they wrote doesn't hold a candle to any movie in the series except Jason Goes To Hell.This ""reimagining"" made about as much sense as Jason's death in Part 8, and is what would have been if the first four films took a sh*t.",Friday the 13th

This movie is definitely the best in the series since the original four and possibly better than 2 and 3, but to the point at hand. The movie is really not to hard on the gore compared to recent standards, but it is heavy on the nudity, the story is well.. It's Friday the 13th but it works, the acting was surprisingly good for a series that usually has the most talented actor behind a mask.The movie is easy to sit down and watch it never gets to tedious because it reels in at 90 minutes so it never feels like it's dragging on, I would recommend this movie to just about any horror fan, whether you like Friday the 13th or not it is still a decent horror movie and will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll and you go home looking over your shoulder.-DJ Dixon 7/10 Stars",Friday the 13th

I can't say I'm happy with this movie, yet somehow, I can't say I hate it. After seeing it in theaters and again in it's ""Killer Cut"" edition, I must conclude that this is a Friday the 13th movie you can put BEHIND some of the others. These are my reasons.First off, the prologue is sort of a kick to the face for any Friday the 13th fan. It is no longer than three minutes and twenty seconds (a little longer with the Killer Cut). You have no idea who the girl is that kills Mrs. Voorhees, and no view or evidence of the horror that caused her to be screaming and running through the camp (Mrs. Voorhees only says, ""I've killed all the others"").The whole first scene with the first group of teens (both casts were bland) was not needed. I totally saw it as a reason for the director to get breasts, drugs, and cursing into the movie. Sure, Jason showed up and burned a girl, chopped a guy's ear off, and kidnapped a girl, but this scene only fueled the disappointments.Which brings me to Whitney. I was open at first to the idea of Jason taking a prisoner and I was looking forward to Whitney pulling a Friday the 13th: Part 2 and putting on Mrs. Voorhees sweater and such, but but that didn't happen. So I just chose to forget about her.The kills were no doubt violent and some were new, but not enough thought was put into them. Some were new, but SIMPLE. An arrow through the forehead, a girl impaled on deer antlers, machete to the head and chest. All were either done before or could have been thought of by a twelve year old.Last comments, Michael Bay needs to stop producing horror remakes. THEY ALL LOOK THE SAME. Texas Chainsaw, Texas Chainsaw: The Beginning, Friday the 13th, ALL LOOKED THE SAME. Blondes and brunettes way too hot to look like the real people they're portraying, the same gritty camera actions like shaking or making way too dark or everyone on film looks like they're sweating, lackluster kills, no plot depth, no passion! HE JUST WANTS MONEY, and remakes are his way of getting it. The new Nightmare on Elm Street better not be like this...But Derek Mears was a wonderful Jason. His portrayal was what kept this from being a one- star review. If you get this movie, rent it. The people who actually will find it scary are young teen girls who think they like horror just because they saw the Ring and Grudge movies, When a Stranger calls 2006, and the new Prom Night. This movie is not for ages 15 and up.",Friday the 13th
586,spartan_steveo,A very fun horror movie to be remembered,10,31 October 2009,"Out of all the slasher characters out there, Jason Voorhees caught my interest the most. He had an interesting back story and his the accessories that define him such as the hockey mask and the machete catch the scary killer image in a strange, but scary way. I got into the Friday the 13th movies when Jason X was already a few years old. I watched all the old ones and Freddy vs Jason. I've come to look up to the Friday the 13th series as a batch of fun-to-watch horror movies. The movies may not be intelligent or passionate, but they are definitely fun to watch. And the this new installment delivers the fun correctly. This Friday the 13th is a remake of the first 4 movies, but twists the plot a bit, so that it works out. I look at it as a Jason movie altered to fit the teen demographic of today. This helps appeal to the crowd of newcomers of the series. The movie has very creative killings, the suspense really gets your heart racing (if you're watching the movie alone) and the music fits the moment really well. I did spot quite a few plot holes the 1st time I saw this movie. And I did spot a few more the 2nd time I saw it. But, it didn't bother me too much, because logic hasn't been the series strong point ever since the first movie came out. It's more of a movie that you should watch if you want to be entertained. A movie that you can watch without your brain turned on and while you're eating a bowl of popcorn. There are a few things in this movie that may confuse newcomers that don't know the story of Jason Voorhees. Plus, this is more of a movie that targets fans of Jason Voorhess himself, rather than fans of horror movies, in general. The reason why is because what the movie gets right is JASON. Out of all the actors that have played the role of Jason in the series, this new actor is by the far the tallest. Making this Jason Voorhees the biggest of them all and that makes the character all the more intimidating. Also, there are a few scenes in the movie that catch the psychological ordeals that Jason goes through. Yes, we all know that Jason is a psycho. But in a way, I kinda felt bad for him. That's when you know that a movie does something right. When they make you feel bad for a fictional character. Recently, I found out that there will be a sequel to this remake. I'm happy to hear this, because I could use some more Jason. Overall, Friday the 13th is a decent movie. It's no masterpiece. It's not even among the top ten scary movies of the world. But, seeing how horror movies have been going down these days, I was happy to see a new horror movie that I actually loved. I give Friday the 13th an 8 out of 10.",Friday the 13th
587,kecir,Driving Jason movies into the ground,1,15 February 2009,GOD! How many times is Hollywood going to drive Jason and Friday the 13th in to the ground. When it first came out in the 1980's it was a great film and then came part 2 and 3 and 4 and 5 and up to 12 production and it started to get boring. Hollywood has killed and raised Jason form the dead that Jason has become a ragged door mat. Hollywood have you came to the point of not being able to produce great films like you did in the past. Is Hollywood washed out with ideas that they have to bring back old production. That is sad really sad if that is so. It time for Hollywood to use their heads and come up wit fresh new butt kicking movies. As for me seeing this movie I want waste my time or money.

My FAVORITE series of horror films is 'Friday the 13th' (at least up to part 5). I didn't start watching horror movies till I was in my late teens, but when I did start watching them I couldn't stop watching them. I know I grew up in the late 70's and early 80's (graduated high school in 91). In my day horrors had a lot more suspense to them, and a lot more leading you up to the shock of watching someone getting butchered. Bay tried too hard with this film to compress 'Friday the 13th' to 'Friday the 13th Part 4: The Final Chapter'. I was hoping in watching this movie that we would see more development of the character Jason Vorhees. I'm sorry I guess I've just really been turned off (my desensitized to horrors) after 1985ish or so. I just truly haven't seen a great horror film in say the last 5 to 10 years (excluding Zombies remake of 'Halloween' and the 'Saw' series. I just wish someone would take the road that Zombie is taking, and try to approach the 70's style of horror films. I give it a 6 out of 10, but I DO recommend at least viewing.

I did a little bit of research before going to see it, found out that the people who were making this movie were actually the ones who remade The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which in my opinion wasn't that bad. But when I actually went to go see the movie, I had mixed signals. I didn't know if it was going to be good, or bad; I just knew I was going to see a horror movie.When I actually watched the movie, I actually saw that a little bit of work went into the movie itself. The acting was actually a little well done, nobody over acting, nobody having an acting ability of a 4 year old when she acts like she didn't steal the cookies from the cookie jar(which we totally know she did). When going to see a Friday the 13th movie, there is always teenagers having sex, this goes without saying, but some of the actual sex scenes borderline soft core-cable-porn, but actually was done well as far as sex scenes go...not that I watch sex scenes like soft core-cable-porn...moving on to the reason you either have seen, or have yet to see, or do not want to see at all...Jason Vorhees.The movie makers seem to have wanted to make a ""re-imagining"" of Jason as a whole. They tried to ""upgrade"" Jason a bit, and as far as my concern, they did so in some aspects, and didn't in others. As you will probably read in other reviews, he's not just some big-dumb guy with a machete anymore, and this may be a bit of a spoiler, he's a big-dumb guy who now has the ability to catch up to you, and uses a variety in the ways of killing people instead of just walk-slow, hack-slash-until-you-die. As far as the death scenes go, most of them were predictable, which is actually kind of a let down. There were some death scenes that just came out of left field, didn't have any suspenseful music to let you know it was coming, it just happened.As far as story goes...ah, who really cares about the story, lets face it. We all know the reason you're going to see it was to see Good-old Jason kill a bunch of young adults who were Tools to begin with, so you didn't feel bad for them when they died. But for those who do care about story, it had a pretty small amount. It was about a guy looking for his sister, who went missing after going camping to Camp Crystal Lake with some friends. That's about it for story, then you see what young adults do best these days, which is getting drunk, high, or having sex. So...yeah.As far as horror movies go, it was pretty descent, but nothing special. If you are a die-hard Jason fan, you might be either extremely disappointed that he's a little bit smarter then you think, or you'll be impressed that Jason isn't just some dumb killer with a hockey mask anymore. Would I recommend it to a friend? If you are into horror movies, then I could recommend it. If you hate remakes? I would probably say it's a rental at least. If you wanna see those ""damn kids"" get what's coming to them, with their drinking, smoking, and shopping almost exclusively at Hollister? Then I would certainly recommend it.Over all, I give it about a 7/10. A descent horror movie, but nothing quite like, ""Oh my, it's the best movie ever!"" Got to love those young adults getting killed though, that's what makes me smile in a movie, how about you?",Friday the 13th
591,chaava-fonseca,Good...but not what was expected.,7,22 February 2009,"I was looking forward seeing this movie from a long time back. I love the old titles and when i found out this remake was coming out and produced by Michael Bay i was really exited so i just counted the day for its release.In few words, it disappointed me a little bit, as said before, the first 20 minutes are very powerful just the brutally that the other ones had and Jason really looks very scary and bad-ass.The rest of the movie, of course, was very predictable. There were some scenes that were very impressive like when he found his mask, his hideout and of course his mothers altar. The way of killing those drunken high teens was brutal and they demonstrate what Jason is all about... a freaking undead Rambo! The nude scenes were good, of course but they put a lot of attention on the last one with the blonde with huge natural breasts.The end was predictable too but to be honest there wasn't another way it could end...it was SO Friday the 13th.In conclusion, those teens had it coming! Who mentally healthy could steal the weed of a 6'4 bad-ass mother f***r armed with a machete?? Not cool dude.7.5/10",Friday the 13th
592,unstablederek,Oh Please,4,20 February 2009,"As a big fan of the 1980 and pre slasher films, i give the new Friday the 13th 4 stars only because of the name only, Jason would never take anyone a prisoner and seem just to pussy like. I wish paramount picture and cunningham did this alone. Because newline tried to turn it into the biggest piece of trash, the music was absolutely ridiculous, not scary not surprising and the sex and nudity was a bit much even for a Friday the 13th flick. Not worth seeing again and i would watch any of the old Friday the 13th 100 times over(except jason goes to hell). Sorry Friday the 13th fans. This one was a bomb, and where the hell was Kane Hodder. Serioussly Kane was best jason ever. The new mother was awful. Come on true fans will see this movie as a travesty not a continuation of the greatness of Fridat the 13th.",Friday the 13th
593,lauriedunsire,Decent for what it is,7,11 August 2009,"As someone who isn't a huge fan of the 'slasher' movie such as this one I have to say I was pleasantly surprised by the Friday the 13th remake.Of course a lot of the movie is pretty predictable but unlike so many films of a similar genre it did keep me going all the way through with some very impressive action scenes and of course plenty of gore. The performances were all pretty solid and it had the usual moments of humour and soft porn that one can expect.Personally I find most films like this a bit repetitive but for what it is I think it is a reasonable film, that had plenty of moments that made me jump and kept me on the edge of my seat.Not for everyone, but many will enjoy this no doubt.",Friday the 13th
594,annonymousT,This Movie sucks!,4,17 March 2009,"This movie should have been titled, 'Boob party', because thats all that it was concentrated on...showing boobs. From the beginning, it was OK..and then gradually, mistake after mistake, the movie turns to be a disaster.""and why'd Jason start killing people from his town/area because outsiders arrived?"" the movie's totally senseless with fake effects..the skull seems like its made out of paper as anything just goes through it like sticking something in margarine. The story itself is pathetic. Beginning, Jason drowns..and comes back, and kills and kills, and kills..nice plot.I would not recommend this for any one! The 4 given is just because of Michael Bay(so thats biased). overall, 2/10.",Friday the 13th
595,bladesblades,Everything You Would Expect.,9,14 February 2009,"I grew up with the old ""Friday the 13th"" films, and I love parts 1 - 8 so naturally I was inclined to see this film. I will admit that the nudity/sex thing was a bit overdone, but at the same time, for me, it made watching the people engaging in said activities get killed that much more enjoyable.Derek Mears was a good choice for Jason, I feel like he kept a lot of the vibe of the old Jason while still bringing something new to it. The rest of the cast was just what you'd expect, attractive females, and jocks doing drugs, and having sex in a cabin for a weekend. I thought Danielle Panabaker did a good job and I think she was the only female who did not take her clothes off so I have respect for her as a result.The story speaks for itself. Simple math: Kids + cabin + Jason = one hell of a slasher film. I think it's an enjoyable watch for fans of the genre (or Jason films). It maintains a lot of vibe from the old movies but it's a fresh take on the classic for this generation of fans.",Friday the 13th
596,trainstalker,Who came up with the bright idea of making Jason an angry drug dealer...,1,10 February 2009,"What a pile of crap.The first 5 Min's are great, kicks of at a great pace slashing and killing etc etc total rampage and then the title comes up 'Friday the 13th'. From then on it practically kills you waiting for it to be over. Slow, unoriginal, bad acting,extremely predictable and trying to be funny and falling short are but a few of the things wrong with this movie. ""if it ain't broken why fix it"" the original was a classic and should have been left alone...Was there any need for the drug references, was this possibly a reference to him living in California and and a doctor prescribing it to him to keep his anger at bay and chill him the f*%k out... or was it a crap way of getting teenagers to actually like it, hey lets chuck some naked chicks and big cannabis plants into a movie to make it a teenage hit!!! Horror movies have come so far in recent times and this has pushed it back into the beta max bin...Should have gone straight to video or maybe just left the original alone for future generations to enjoy.I'm sure it will be a hit with grown men who live at home with there mums reading comics and dressing up as Darth Vader once in a while for sexual kicks..DON""T WASTE YOUR TIME",Friday the 13th
597,smoches,blah,3,19 February 2009,"Loved how the action starts from the very beginning; that's the ONLY good thing. I absolutely HATE how they totally ""modernized"" Jason. The whole thing that scared me about Jason from all his other movies was the fact that he chases after his victim's by WALKING, but in this case, Jason is running and he has this super QUICK ability all of a sudden to run and what not. if ANYONE is planning on doing a remake, please stick with the walking... I hope the new Nightmare on Elm Street is up to Par with the classic ones. It would actually be really cool to have Robert Enguland play Freddy; that's why I watched all of them because he was sooo good at it. SCREW MODERN!",Friday the 13th
598,toolshed1485,Yet another Great Opportunity Missed,5,9 March 2009,"The thing that was great about Friday the 13th series was the mythology tied to it. The dark story, this established history. Even though it's a slasher flick, there is this disturbing realistic story about this poor boy who drowns at summer camp, and his mother's revenge.This movies fails to even attempt at making that history real. The background story is stumbled through, at best, and regurgitated in a handful of lines delivered by probably one of the worst casts in the series history. I'm sorry, but there's nothing more insulting to me as a fan of real horror than throwing this ""cookie cutter"" cast of beautiful bimbos and moron jocks, whose looks outweigh any acting talent, and trying to re-create one of greatest cult classic horror movies of the 80's. All I'm saying is this movie could have been so much greater if some better casting was done, and a better screen writer was chosen. I mean this was a great opportunity to revitalize the series, and start anew. Instead we were given another ""cookie cutter"" slasher flick to end up in the 2 for 10$ bin at Wal-mart.The only redeeming qualities of this movie are a handful of great death and gore scenes, and maybe one or two good ""jump scare"" sequences. I gave this movie a 5 only because I got to watch these horrible actors get brutally murdered. I only wish the director made a cameo as well, shortly there after to be killed.My personal recommendation would be to NOT pay the 9$ to see it in the theater. Definitely wait to rent, especially if you're a fan of the original series.",Friday the 13th
599,ashadowcast69,if your an actual fan of the originals and don't like this film your dumb.,9,11 May 2009,"honestly ff you ever saw the first 4 movies, you can easily see that Jason Voorhees is being portrayed as the best of all those characters. Ted White's maniac on the loose portrayal can easily be seen, and has been mistakenly taken as ""hey, i've never seen anything but stuff past part 5 but look Jason runs in this one."" IMDb comments from quote unquote fans weren't any better. seriously kids, check your sources. on to the film; not once did i think that Jason Voorhees was truly being portrayed as a frightening character, but as a brute force wrecking crew. oh, by the way to the kid who said jason wouldn't stop if you looked like his mother,Pamela, watch part 2 or even the beginning sequence of part 3 and notice what ginny does to ""trick"" jason. yeah the teenagers we're stereotypical, but they have always been that way. to sum up this one is in my top 3 of all the films, for reasons that can be explained very simply. I like the human wrecking crew Jason, and am not as big of a fan of zombie Jasonon to the other actors; typical Friday the 13th. cheap good looking actors who can get a pop out of a one liner. quality for fans of the original 4; if your not going to go thats not how it happened then, its not bad. just a few little nods to guys and gals like myself.brutality level; all time high! holy blue f*** Jason is back. ABOUT TIME!Is this Kane? no, not to down Kane Hodder but Derek Mears owned the role.overall it gets a 9 because its a breath of fresh air for fans and first timers alike.",Friday the 13th
600,usranger13,I'm too disappointed in the movie to think of a clever summary line,3,22 June 2009,"I've been a Friday the 13th fan since I was a kid. I have every movie in the set and was extremely excited to hear that they were making a new movie. I was there for the premiere on February 13th and by the end of the night, the series has gone the route of many of these recent horror classic ""remakes"".Obviously, Friday the 13th has never had much of a story. Little Jason drowned as a kid, his mom goes on a rampage, his mom is decapitated, Jason goes on a rampage against all the pot-smoking, beer-drinking, horny teenagers he can find. Like I said...never been much of a story but for some reason, each Friday the 13th movie was a pure classic in my eyes until this one.Where to start? Well the thing that bothered me most about this movie was how compacted the movie was. It pretty much covers Friday the 13th Part 1, 2 and 3 and squeezes them into 1 movie. It covers the murder of Mrs. Voorhees (Part 1), Jason sporting the potato sack on his head (Part 2) and the uncovering of the now infamous hockey mask (Part 3).Secondly, I hated how they completely changed Jason in this movie. First off, Jason DOES NOT RUN!!! Jason has never run in the first 11 movies...why change that now? But they decide that they will have Jason running after people. I felt like I was watching one of the ""Scream"" movies. On another point, Jason DOES NOT TAKE PRISONERS!!! I spent the entire movie thinking that he kills everyone he sees only to find out that he ""captured"" a woman that looked like mom and was keeping her in some underground bunker. Finally, Jason DOES NOT TORTURE PEOPLE!!! That's one thing I always liked about Jason and Michael...they killed a person in the fastest and bloodiest way possible. Instead, I sat there watching Jason string up a woman in a sleeping bag and setting the bag on fire and set up beat traps to catch people in, which any Friday Fan can tell you is just not Jason.Not everything is bad about this movie though. There were some death scenes that would throw any Friday Fan into memory lane of the previous movies. Without a doubt, the best is the ax throwing scene...100% pure Voorhees.While the whole movie is really not that bad, it just isn't the same and you can tell that there was different people behind the scenes. Hopefully, they will do some research on the older movies if they choose to make another movie.",Friday the 13th
601,bctrain2001,"As a Friday fan, I cant complain",8,14 February 2009,"I thought this was a very good Friday the 13th movie. I mean, none of that crazy stuff like jason in space, or jason fightin freddy, just back to basics crystal lake mayhem at its best. and jason is more aggressive than ever. very good remake, and i hope there is a sequel to it. and oh yeah, willa ford has a great rack. and yeah, jason has electricity, and he does just suddenly appear on the roof of a house, but cmon, its a jason movie. it is what it is. there's always something that cant be logically explained in a jason movie. and seeing the house jason lived in as a child was cool too. I would have liked to see betsy palmer make a cameo, and there was a role she would have been perfect for in this movie, but it didn't happen. overall, great remake though",Friday the 13th
602,toadsniffing,A little short but well done,8,13 February 2009,"First off, I was definitely disappointed that I hardly heard any chanting of ""cha cha cha ma ma ma."" If you are a Friday the 13th fan or TRUE horror fan, I would suggest seeing this. Otherwise, I would recommend you not to see it because it is just as typical as the next Friday the 13th. There aren't many surprises in this film and its like you might as well watch the original. However, the death scenes were modern and well done (even funny!) and Jason seemed REALLY scary - unlike Jason Goes to Hell where he looks like a gorilla in a mask.Overall, I would say go see it if you are a horror film fan. Other then that, it's not surprising and it is typical Friday the 13th. One dies right after the other.",Friday the 13th
603,alliandbilly,"Not as cheesy, trashy, or generally terrible as expected.",6,16 July 2009,"First off, when I ordered this movie, I expected to see all the usual factors of recent slasher movies. Stupid teenagers drinking, having sex (cheating or just being slutty in general), smoking marijuana, or a combination of the three, accompanied by half-rate acting. Surprisingly, the movie exceeded my expectations, although some of the aforementioned factors took place, as they must in all recent horror films.Before the movie title even appeared on screen, nearly all of the first batch of teen-aged campers were killed. Starting the movie off with such violence and gore that was neither over-the-top nor cheesy, made room for even more credible violence and fright to the movie. It caught my interest right away. Aside from one girl, Whitney, who seemed fairly intelligent and, well, more human than the others, and her similar boyfriend, the teenagers were drug users, eager to get naked and have sex, and trashy. The second group of campers was similar, with the exception of one girl, Jenna who was also intelligent and kind. Clay, Whitney's brother who is in search of her, was the most likable character of the movie.The drinking, marijuana-smoking, and promiscuous teens all died in gruesome ways, as is expected. There were many ""boo"" moments, as we watched them all die, that Jason appeared out of nowhere. Certain methods of killing were frightening and slightly disturbing as well, sometimes happening very slowly, almost torturous. All but one of the more relate-able characters survived, and used their survival instincts wisely. That said, the nudity, drinking, and drug use in the movie were almost at a minimum for horror movie standards. Movies of this genre, today, have horribly disturbing and gruesome deaths as well as nudity and sex scenes almost to the point of porn, with no morals at all. Movie makers are clearly trying, with each new slasher film, to push the limit on what content is suitable for a movie that anyone 17 years old can see in theaters and, doubtless, plenty of kids way under that age will watch. In Friday the 13th, nudity appeared quite a bit, as well as two sex scenes (one much less graphic than the second), but it was much less gratuitous than other recent horror films. All four characters shown in these sex scenes (obviously shown to be promiscuous and trashy, or males objectifying the girls) were clearly portrayed as much less than good people, and consequently, were killed. Drug use was only shown once, although many references were made, and the entire second set of campers (save one) was drinking a lot of alcohol at one point. However, these are things that most older teens will inevitably do on camping trips, or at their own parties, and is only to be expected to appear in any horror film that must rely on spectacle rather than engaging characters and plot. Despite the fact that all characters who drink, use drugs, or have trashy sex are obviously the first to die in slasher films, the last bit of the movie contained suspense, as Jason was stalking the 'good' teens who were the only survivors; there were also a few unexpected twists.While the movie had many frightening and suspenseful, and yet sometimes predictable, scare scenes, Jason Voorhees was developed into a truly terrifying villain. The movie began with a scene involving Jason's mother, Pamela, trying to kill the last surviving camp counselor, proclaiming that she(the counselor) should die like all the other counselors for letting her son drown. The counselor decapitates Pamela and flees, and Jason, as a young boy, appears and takes his mother's locket. The screen fades to black, and other opening credits, with Pamela's voice, telling Jason(presumably) to ""kill for mother"". Other than that, no information about Jason is learned. Throughout the movie, he moves fast, is clearly very strong and very agile, as well as cunning, and always seems to know where the campers are, even without aid of his bells. His deformed face is only shown once, briefly, and his voice is never heard. The audience knows only what happened at Crystal Lake, and only that he is clearly very mentally and emotionally disturbed. With no hard information and thus no understanding of Jason, the audience can't find any concrete motivation for his actions, or comprehension of why he has not been caught or of the strengths and skills he has. Furthermore, he shows no weakness. Even after the only two surviving characters kill him, he comes back out of the water to grab Whitney's leg. He cannot be killed, he cannot be evaded, and he will never stop murdering innocent people. Therefore, he seems to be superhuman, incomprehensible, and totally terrifying. Friday the 13th, the remake, combines the first, second, third, and fourth original movies, but does not outwardly and straight-forwardly convey that Jason is superhuman and indestructible, but instead leaves that fact, too, a mystery for the audience to fear for themselves. It will never win any Oscars or leave any viewer with a profound feeling or revelation, but is simply a fun movie to watch, laugh at, and be frightened by. Never for one second does the movie appear to be trying to be something it's not, and is a great choice if you want to be scared without",Friday the 13th
604,eternity16,Jasons back,7,11 February 2009,"I had the opportunity to see Friday the 13th in a special screening. I had seen Jason movies before and had high expectations for the new one. During the movie, I couldn't help but think that Iv'e seen the story before. Everything seemed the same. But then I remembered it was a Jason slasher. How much more new could it get? The story was OK, Its your typical teens in a wood scenario. Party kids you know. The acting was mostly good. Some characters couldn't act at all. But other than that I enjoyed it. If your expecting to see a Jason movie then you should go see this. Its got slashing and killings and sex. If your expecting to see something new. Don't get your hopes up. This movie is just like every other one, just prettier looking because its newer.",Friday the 13th
605,ovdome1126,Had High Expectations,6,13 February 2009,"I had high expectations for this movie, and it went above and beyond. Really....what's wrong with it? A great opening, a good plot for the F13 movie, and a great kill ending. You expect Jason to come back out of the water in the end, and it leaves it open for another movie. For the people who think they were catering to teenagers with all the weed references, it's just part of the movie...and they did it in a bunch of the other F13 movies too. This movie was better, much better, than most of the previous movies that came out in this series. People hate on it and ""love"" the other movies because they are originals and that's what they saw first. Characters are better in these movies, and Jason is much better. The hick at the wood chipper was hilarious, as well as Chewie. About Jason tilting his head, he did that in several movies before this one. It's no reference on Michael Myers and Halloween. About Jason ""teleporting"" from place to place and being places so quickly, ever since the beginning of #7 he's done that, when he got his super strength and always seemed to be in two places so quickly. Nothing changed. The only thing different is that Jason ran much more than in any other movie. The only other movie where he came close to running after a victim was #4. Not quite the best in the series (maybe 3rd) but definitely not the worst like most people are making it out to be. The only reason they don't like it is because it's a remake, it's not the original, and they go into it with a mindset that it already sucks, so that's why they come out with that mindset too. Great movie....go see it.",Friday the 13th
606,realisticcriticism,Pleasantly Surprised,8,13 February 2009,"It's rare these days I enter a movie theater to see a horror film and leave anything short of sorely disappointed but today differed from recent past experiences. I've been a fan of the original Friday The 13th for many years now and was of course skeptical of this ""remake"" but decided to give it a shot nonetheless. I'm a fan of horror movies - this includes good, bad, and indifferent so I figured why not? Being that Friday The 13th was one of my favorites, I didn't expect much. From start to finish the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. It isn't so much the suspense but instead, the moments you know are coming just not when or how they'll be approached exactly. It takes quite a bit to frighten me and I counted a good 2 or 3 times I actually jumped throughout the film. There's plenty of gore for the gore lovers, plenty of sexual explicitness for the perverts, and plenty of drugs for the stoners just like an old fashioned horror movie should contain.This film is not a remake but rather a revision and one I came to appreciate much within the first 10 minutes. The action begins almost immediately and builds steadily throughout the hour and thirty five minutes it lasts, right up until the very last shot. I say to those of you who bash this or claim it's a ""rip off"" or a ""poor remake"" consider this - It's neither. It is instead a different look at our old pal Jason and one that can be appreciated greatly if given the opportunity. Don't shun the film simply because it bares the title of an old favorite of yours and mine... Look at it as a modern take on an old time classic with new characters (who admittedly are annoying and overly obnoxious at times just as most teenagers/twenty-somethings in films, especially of the horror genre, usually are) and an (almost) entirely different plot. This movie wasn't made to be compared to the original. It wasn't trying to replace what it was to begin with and people need to keep this in mind before going to see it. Do not enter a theater with expectations, especially not high ones. Whenever you do, you find yourself let down at your own expense, not the expense of the film you're seeing or your experience seeing it.With this in mind, I highly recommend checking this one out. You won't be disappointed if you're seeing it in the right mind set and that is a very open minded one.",Friday the 13th
607,tennwo02,The Texas Chainsaw massacre Remake... Or was it Friday the 13th?,3,14 February 2009,"Did you know a horror franchise drowned a day before this week? The Producer and Directer weren't paying any attention... They were counting their money while that cult icon drowned. It's name was Friday the 13th. I watching the night it happened. Losing my temper... there. I was a fan. Friday the 13th should have been awesome. Every minute! It was... It wasn't a very good remake. We can give up now... fans.You see Friday the 13th was my favorite movie... and today it was raped.I mistakingly had high expectations of this movie. Of course I was bothered by the fact that Marcus Nispel, who did such a smash up job on Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, was directing. In fact besides the fact that Jason wore a hockey mask, had an affinity for machetes and his mother was in it for five seconds. It was almost impossible to differentiate between the two movies. Lots of slack jawed yokels and shaky camera action in the dark, just like Chainsaw. Poor story telling with numerous loose ends, just like Chainsaw. Terrible adaptation, just like Chainsaw.Okay, maybe I'm being a little too hard on the movie. The first few minutes of the movie were incredible. Of coarse there' no rhyme or reason to Jason's return from the grave, but they never had on in the original either. The elements that they took from the first four movies were there, and yes I said 'Four' movies. There were elements from the Final Chapter despite what the propaganda says. The acting wasn't terrible. Yoo's character was probably the funniest character to ever be in a Friday the 13th to date. The under the dock kill was so classic that it felt like it belonged and it was good to see Jason in his old sack mask again.Many key elements were there, but only for a second or two. Mrs. Voorhees head wasn't really elaborated on and wouldn't be caught as significant to anyone who hadn't seen the original movies. Despite all the hype about how Jason gets his hockey mask in this movie, it was a big let down and just seemed a little too convenient. The locals in the town were basically rejects from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. In fact the scenery may have appeared New Englandish... but the locals just screamed, ""I'm from Texas!"" Jason Voorhees. How could they screw up a character like Jason Voorhees? Give these folks a hand though. They did it. I started to realize that Jason wasn't quite himself around the sleeping bag death scene. First and foremost Jason is a killer, not a sadistic torturer. Sure he's done some pretty brutal things to his victims, but roasting a person alive, just isn't his style. It's too much set up for Jason honestly. Additionally, if Jason has you on the ground with a machete coming down at you, you are DEAD. He doesn't lock you in his basement and keep you alive for months because you're a pretty girl who looks like his mother. Jason kills. And he especially kills if you impersonate his mother. The end... in more ways than one. When I watched the ending of this movie I literally had the feeling that I was ripped off. The pay off with the wood chipper wasn't even utilized here. And then for some reason the survivor(s), another thing that was lame, decided to dump his body in the lake. This means they had to actively decide it was a good idea to get rid of the evidence that they were not the manics that killed a bunch of people, but it also means that they had to take Jason out of the chipper, take the chain off his neck, remove his mask, and carry him all the way out to the dock. And if Jason was playing possum the entire time, why didn't he just kill them when he still had access to a wood chipper and a barn full of tools? In fact this movie raised nothing but questions. Who killed Mrs. Voorhees? What ever happened to her? Why did Jason miraculously come back from the dead? Why was his body still intact after all those years in the lake? Why does Jason wear a mask? How did he keep the rats from eating his mother's head? Why did the local cops not bother investigating anything? How did Jason learn to hook up electricity to his camp? Why didn't the power company notice nobody's paying the electric bill for an abandoned summer camp? Why would Jason keep some girl chained up in his basement? Why do all the locals of Crystal Lake appear to have come from Texas? Why did they bother doing makeup for Jason when they show his face for maybe two frames of the whole movie? Why does Jason pop out of the lake at the end with his mask on? What were they thinking? Why did I see this miserable attempt to remake a great movie? Why am I wasting more time on a bad review?

This movie felt like it was whipped together quickly just to meet the Friday 13th release date. No suspense, way to many sexual references and boob shots. The characters were either talking about sex, having sex, showing their boobs, or talking about/doing drugs the entire movie! This is very tasteless and shows lack creativity! They should have let Rob Zombie redo this one! We did not even stay for the entire movie because it was such a let down. Not hard to believe that 85% of the votes on this movie come from males.",Friday the 13th
609,cllcn,"decent, but not Jason",4,14 February 2009,"I'll start off by saying that this movie was good for what it was; A predictable, dark, scary, gruesome, teen movie.If you want a Jason movie, watch the old ones.This isn't it.Jason ran more in this movie than in the original series. Why did he run? to make it scary. Why'd they make it scary? Because they wanted to make it appealing and they wanted to make a lot of money.This isn't a frigging saw movie. Why is he burning people alive?? And what is up with rich daddies son, and all his extremely sexy friends? What are they doing in this movie? It's supposed to be campers and camp councilors. Not little babies who go to a condo in the woods on daddies expense.They characters weren't that great. The ones I liked a lot were Chewie and Lawrence. They reminded me of characters that would have been in the original. Best buds that stuck together. The rest, I really didn't care for.Where is the original Friday The 13th theme music? I heard it all of twice. And what was up with the kill music they had? It sounded like The Hills Have Eyes.Some parts, the camera was extremely shaky so I could hardly see what was going on. And you could only see Jason's real face twice, which I missed both times because it was only a quick glimpse.They tried to give it more story than it really was, and left out a lot of explanation. His underground layer, and lighting in his house was just funny. I couldn't help but laugh. Jason doesn't know how to set up Christmas lights. He knows how to kill people.The ending was decent. I liked how he jumped out of the water at the end. But I didn't like the fact that the brother and sister stuck around to do a funeral for a maniac. Why would they do that? Don't you think they'd be out of there??? I would.If it were up to me. I would have ended the movie with him hanging in the chains. That would have made sense to me. That's an ending to a original movie, and this movie had little to no originality.If you're looking for a movie that looks a lot like new Texas chainsaw massacre and the hills have eyes, than watch this. If you're looking for a good remake, watch Halloween or something. This was not a Jason movie.",Friday the 13th
610,eddievanholt,"Where's the gore? Good, but not great...",6,19 February 2009,"I went into this movie with high expectations, but maybe I shouldn't have. I love horror movies, so this review is from a true horror fan. I've seen every Jason movie to date. I guess what disappointed me the most was the lack of gore, and even though there was some suspense there wasn't enough chase scenes. Basically, Jason just killed people off one by one and you knew almost every time when. The characters, for the most were annoying and you just wanted them to die in a gruesome way. It's funny how the two characters who lived had every chance to be killed off, but never were. To me this was unrealistic. Jason is good at killing and once he gets you he kills you, no ands, ifs, or buts. Anyhow, there were a few scenes that were surprising. One of the leads got killed unexpectedly. I wish she lived, not the other two. The ending was a let down. It wasn't original. It was expected. The trailer looks much better than this movie is and if they changed a few things, well, this could have been a promising movie. Again, where was the gore. Jason X had better death scenes. I'd still recommend to go see it if you're a horror fan. It wasn't terrible, yet still not as good as it should have been.",Friday the 13th
611,spawn1975,extreme fan extremely disappointed,4,14 February 2009,"I have been a huge fan of Friday/jason films since they came out. Hell I even met Kane Hodder and had him sign my Jason mcfarlane toy, and I even own some screen used props from the films. And I regret that I need to say the following.Why do these companies feel that they need to attempt a re do of a classic film? They destroyed TCM, Halloween and now Friday. If you ask me it is a major disrespect to the original films. They bunged up sooo many things in this film. Jason never leaves his victims, Jason never runs, Jason is almost 7 feet tall, and Jason never, ever EVER holds his victims hostage. These guys used that same similar plot from F vs J on how Jason came back to life, but never revealed how, he simply appeared. Apparently the writers don't know anything about Jason.I realize that this is an attempt to get a new crowd into the movie franchise. The film was well done, but like I mentioned above, they goofed the story line of Jason way too much. I would not recommend seeing the movie, just wait till it comes out on DVD and rent it and come to your own conclusion. Next thing you know they will redo NOES and not cast Robert Englund as Freddy. Sorry folks, but I just wasn't that impressed, and kind of wished i never saw it, but hey, I have all of the originals, so I'm good!",Friday the 13th
612,aftermaf3258,Awesome,10,16 February 2009,"my review this movie makes original Friday fans feel like a kid again, it certainly has a bit of comic relief. Which is a nice touch, like the girl underneath the docks. If you haven't seen it i wont ruin that for you. Truly memorable ha ha. And although i enjoyed the Texas remake, the Halloween as well.(one of the few people that did...) This really didn't have that extra level of gore, Which means you can bring your kids with you to see it. Enjoy it with them just as myself and im sure many others did with there parents back in the day. The story line and acting is very well written, i think. the murder scenes are very memorable and some are certainly fresh. Anyway with any Friday fan who has been patiently waiting for this special moment in horror film history, lol this movie really breaks the mold. There truly aren't to many flaws to this already classic revamping of Friday THE 13th... I hope anyone with a little respect for the series loves it as much as i do.-Peace",Friday the 13th

This was just the same as part 9,and Jason X in other words ""predictable"" there was nothing new at all (apart from Jason runs instead of walking and although this would never happen in a Jason film he keeps somebody alive in his lair till the last act of the film ), i didn't really care much for the characters either weather they lived or died. The only reason i gave it 2 in the ratings was for a very good death scene involving Jason's machete about half way through. very boring indeed i really hope the Nightmare on elm street revamp will not turn out the same as this low par re vamp did.",Friday the 13th

Since wen has Jason ran???? it is a well known fact he has always walked. plus they didn't have the music and they didn't have the build up to the killings, there was no suspense. Another thing that they lacked was to show his past, all they showed was Mrs. Vorhee's getting killed from the very first one and the rest was just said in an 'around the fire horror story'. I think that if i hadn't seen the original Friday the 13th's then i would have thought it was a good film but because i have, to me it wasn't a good remake of it, i would have liked it to have had more suspense.",Friday the 13th

It was a joke compared to the first four in the series.Jason is a serial killer without any planning and the plot line with the trip wire is unbelievable.There was no interaction or character building of the main characters and this film is far worse to the original. In my opinion current Hollywood horror is dire and we need to promote Asian/Japanese horror",Friday the 13th
616,adam_reilly,Better than the original......but still not good enough,3,16 February 2009,"I for one have never been a ""true fan"" of this franchise, my loyalties and heart remain with Michael Myers in Halloween. But non-the-less it still holds a place in my heart and a pivotal place in the horror genre. I feel that some people are focusing on the little insignificant things as to why to hate this movie i.e he ran etc. I personally don't find him running a problem as he did in the first few installments and people seem to forget he was human or non-zombiefied back then. I didn't mind the opening too much because i felt the original movie wasn't too good so i welcomed the cut of the first movie but i still would have liked to of seen more flash backs and a better back story as it only never bothered me because i had seen the original. If you haven't then it makes no sense that scene being there because it wasn't explained enough. I found this movie a little too far fetched with no essence, no suspense and basically no stronghold for a good story line. I felt that the death scenes were drastically un-original and very repetitive, i mean i think he stabbed 4 people in the head in almost the same way just with different camera angles and objects. They just weren't very creative. I found myself asking loads of questions in this movie as to why this was happening and why that was happening and getting very confused. The underground tunnels didn't seem needed and for someone that only knows how to kill he seems very technical with the traps and the electricity etc. 'Psycho' or 'Hannibal' i would get that but Voorhees? just didn't make sense. The ending was very strange and really not well thought out, i didn't understand why the last two survivors un-chained Jason from the chains took his mask off, dragged him all the way to the lake and dumped the 'evidence' in the lake? does it give him special powers or something? because if he was playing dead he had ample opportunities to kill them then. It just made me think well if that was me, police are on there way several people including a police officer are dead. Oh i know lets get rid of the evidence and the actual killer to make it look like i was that stoned off my head i killed everyone. hm just no sense at all. I think the only thing that was better was the acting, compared to the originals it was brilliant and had a decent cast. The gore (well for someone that gored up Chainsaw Masacre unlike its original that had no gore at all) i was expecting a little more. The nudity went far FAR to overboard and wasn't need it. I know that every slasher has boobs in and if you don't get boobs in the first half hour then it cannot be classed as a good slasher but there was just far too much on the verge of a soft porno. There was no feeling or relation with the characters i don't think i found myself wanting any of them to survive and i don't think i was even bothered whether they did or not. The camera shots weren't too good i think the only one that stood out to me the most was when the girl went to look in the shower and pulled back the curtain no one was there then she pulled it open some more and jason was there.He kept a hostage yes a hostage who after all that he (assumably) killed so it was all for nothing. I know I know she ""apparently"" looked like the mother but she didn't even play on it, i mean it was all set up the pictures the head she found the house everything and she still didn't play on the oh pretend to be the mother because he seems to listen. So it made me think why are you even there. I also still don't get that after how many people have died there the locals are fine the police don't care but yet the camp site is still open and there's a big cabin house there. At least in Halloween they made the house derelict after a while, and in Elm Street they tried to forget Freddy. Overall this film had very poor direction and they could have done SO much more with it, High budget, decent cast, Mr Bay. But they let a good opportunity for my generation to actually go hey Jason is cool pass them by. And i left thinking i didn't particularly like the movies back then and well i still don't now. Big Disappointment!",Friday the 13th
617,zoheba,Originality of Jason is lost,5,17 February 2009,"The movie was quite interesting when it first started but ended up being a dull fare. I always admired the character of Jason but in this movie they have manage to change him totally. Didn't like the fact that he was an Olympic gold medalist in archery and also the fact that he now runs and chases people. I hoped, since Micheal bay produced this movie, that Jason would be realistic instead the freak never dies. (Man!! how do you kill this thing!!!). Acting was alright, nothing too special and honestly I personally thought that older movies had more better special effects and blood. The movie lacked story or at least there should have been more blood and gore.",Friday the 13th
618,mr-forest,Modern,5,21 February 2009,"Well, it's not really what I expected. First off, Marcus Nispel did a good job on the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" re-make, but I wasn't really that impressed with Friday The 13th. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre took place in 1973 (where the original took place around that time frame) but Friday The 13th took place Present day which I thought kinda of ruined it for me. I think it harmed the overall films persona and it didn't make it feel right. I think Marcus could have spent a little more time on the film to make it feel right and get into the whole ""Friday the 13th"" vibe. The actors weren't that great either, I just wanted Jason to kill them off so the movie could be over. I know that sounded a bit too harsh maybe, but the film was too typical especially for a re-make of one of the most known slasher movies. He could have spent more time organizing a better cast. But as for Jason, I think the guy did a reasonable job.",Friday the 13th

Apparently, they forgot about his birthday. That probably explains the mass murder and maniacal bloodlust. I'd probably hide out in the woods and wait for unsuspecting teenagers to step onto my carefully placed bear traps, and then extract their nutrients for my personal use................DON'T FORGET MY PRESENTS DAMNIT!! (Personal motives aside and onto the review)Senseless killing has always been the integral part of the ""Friday the 13th"" franchise, and this adaptation does not disappoint in that department. This film does unfortunately, however, fail in others. If you're looking for a grand and monumental horror flick, look elsewhere. Actually, let me rephrase that. If you're looking for a horror flick in general, look elsewhere.Friday the 13th rehashes the standard ""scare tactics"" used throughout the horror film universe. That is of course expected. ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" right? Well if you keep using it as many times as this movie did, then eventually it will break. Friday the 13th continually pounds away at the basic elements of horror, while failing to venture into anything experimental and innovative. There are about two or three unpredictable scenes at most. By trying to recapitulate the older version (if that is indeed the reason for the movie's simplicity), the movie becomes bland and falls short of its new age potential.But despite this shortcoming, the film isn't completely awful. Disappointing maybe, but not awful. Jared Padelecki is a solid lead, the women accurately present what is to be represented, and Aaron Yoo provides some comedic relief midst the massacre. The other actors are adequate enough, and there are minimal, if any, flaws with their performances. The soundtrack is decent, though it hardly contributes towards the overall tone and presentation of the movie.~Summary~ (THANK GOD): If you're bringing a second pair of pants to this film, don't worry about it because you won't need them. If you want to watch some idiot teenagers getting ravaged in the woods by a machete wielding fish-ogre-ninja giant.............go see a psychiatrist.This movie probably won't scare you too much, if at all. You may jump once or twice, but that's it. To enjoy this flick, throw out any expectation of a creepiness factor and try to focus on its ""coolness."" Also, if you're definitely set to watch this movie, don't wait for it to come onto DVD. See it in theaters, unless you have a killer surround sound system since it draws its strength from the usual ""bursts of noise."" The final verdict: 3 Stars out of 5 which becomes..(*does some crazy mathematics*)6 out of 10! Hooray for indefinite integration!",Friday the 13th
620,black-jond,"Nice addition to the franchise, but not the best",8,2 March 2009,"Spoilers inside The Friday the 13th remake starts out great with some inventive kills in the first 20 minutes, however the kills following were not quite as interesting. Best kill scene is probably the sleeping bag death. I also enjoyed the arrow through the eye scene, which was reminiscent of Friday 3 with Catherine Parks death scene. The action in the middle of the movie was lost as we basically watch Jason stalk his prey, as our heroes try to get everyone to listen to them about what the saw with Jason and body.The acting was better than some of the other Fridays, as it seemed everyone had fun making the movie. I wish their would have been more gore, since it was a Friday the 13th movie, but with a uncut version to hit DVD, I am sure we will see more gore in it. The actresses were attractive and their is some nice nudity, which any true slasher movie needs. The scenery with the location was nice and looked worthy of a setting for Jason.Overall Friday the 13th was a good way to kill time, but it is not the best in the franchise. I think it was more a sequel to the other Fridays than true remake. Hopefully with a sequel likely to happen the gore and more character development will be added.",Friday the 13th

The pace of this movie is far to fast and it never really focuses on any event at all. Everything that happens seems like the makers were just trying to get it over and done with as fast as possible. I was in the cinema watching this and it was packed. Not once did anyone scream or jump when watching this. I think I wasn't the only one that felt a bit cheated. I and my friends left the cinema in silence. The first thing said was by my friend. He said ""Lets never speak of this film again"".

Parts of this movie that seemed to be blatant idea pinching from the other movies, anyone who has seen all these movies will probably agree with me.There are other parts that confuse me. Jason was running around in plain sight, not his stereotypical walking. They destroyed the memory of his mother and the scene that was created in the earlier movies of the relationship with his mother.Overall, I suppose I shouldn't have expected more from a part 12 of a franchise but I thought maybe Michael Bay could have done a reasonable job with this ... obviously that was not the case.I will say, halfway through the movie we get the real Jason and he also appears at the end, being sneaky and vicious just the way we love.",Friday the 13th

The sex kittens, the jerks, the drug users, everyone who should have died, died; until Jenna got that machete through her chest, it was unneeded bloodshed. No one else should have died, at least until the next Friday the 13th movie. She may not have been very tough, but Jenna's status as the virgin was completely ignored and flies in the face of movie lore set down years ago. Not since ""Cherry Falls"" which painted virgins as victims has this lore ever been altered, and that suuucks!Personally, at the end of the movie, I would have had Jason grab the sister just as Jenna and the hero are about to kiss, but that's just me.",Friday the 13th

It's all going downside for a couple of years now and assuming from this movie, it will continue getting worse until it reaches a point where.. you'll be watching a porno in which a girl has her period. But okay, let's get to the movie.The movie isn't so bad if you lower your criteria.. A LOT! It's another Friday 13th movie and ofc. Jason is going all mad with his machete. First of all I'm not a fan of the Friday 13th series, but I've seen worse. Anyway, he is revenging his mother by killing random people (hell of a story(!), in my days I remember revenge as like, hmm.. revenging the family that did you wrong? Not by going around and pwning everything that walks and talks). So he is like a super-robot. Lives down in his cave, and he can hear you a km away. So that would be cool if he could then pick up his machete, and go out to get you. That would be also cool for you because you could run away, but hell no! He teleports! And by teleports I don't think he pulls out a gadget does that. As I understand it, how the director saw it, he actually does run and get you.. in the speed of light obviously. So anyway, the chances of you getting away are 0%. After that he carries your body to his cave, but wait, if there's another person a few km away, *woosh* he's there and fully ready (not tired a bit) to kill that person to. And that's it really.Oh yeah, in the movie you got one prick of a boyfriend, his girlfriend and a good guy (so the girl and the good guy stick together and so on, and so on..). And you have a lot of sex, some explicit content, a lots of boobies and some pussies and well, you now understand me when I say ""you'll be watching a porno in which a girl has her period"".Well, enjoy if that's your style.",Friday the 13th

This movie was absolutely HORRIBLE. The first 15 minutes of the movie was the only good part after that it was dumb! The characters in this movie are horrible actors. As well as the dialogue! The picture and lightening was terrible too. Anyone who has seen the past Friday the 13th movies knows that Jason doesn't move fast when he goes after his victims. The victims run and he walks after them and in this movie they make Jason run and move too fast it looks ridiculous. I rented this movie and after that I decided I wasn't going to waste my money and time to re-watch it again or buy it on DVD to add to my Friday 13th collection.

626,joellloyd-1,Horrible,1,3 July 2009,"What do you get when you combine hardcore American porn with all the saw films combined? The Friday the 13th remake. It was probably the most stupid horror movie I've ever seen aside from Black Xmas, like straight up. They ruined the original with this crap. I don't think the movie had a gap bigger than 10 minutes where someone wasn't smoking pot or getting their junk wet. Is that all teenagers are good for? A bunch of college douche bags going on a vacation with a crap load of weed and plans on getting laid every hour on the hour, I mean, I like seeing a pair of boobs just as much as the next guy but this was ridiculous. It had no plot whatsoever, I don't even consider it a remake, it's basically a sequel. They didn't even explain why the girl at the start was running from Jason's mother and why she was killing people. I mean, I've seen the original so I know why but it's a remake and a reboot of the series which means it has no relation to the previous movies anymore. Starting fresh and exploring the movie to suit its modern audience. So let's pretend this was the very first Friday the 13th movie ever made, how confusing would the starting be? It would make absolutely no sense so what the hell was the point of it? It's like it's the sequel of the remake that was never made. And another thing; how annoying did it get knowing that Jason happened to be in the right place at the exact right time for every single person? How in the world can he know where everyone was at all times? How can he get from place to place so fast with such good timing without fail? I mean sure it's just a horror movie but you need to have a sense of realism in it as well. Of course you'll attract the brain dead teenage audience but if you want any recognition as a real and creative director than this was not a wise movie to make. The deaths were unoriginal and unrealistic, the actors were horrible, the script was pathetic, and the plot didn't even exist. And not to mention the ending, how in the world can a human survive a machete through the heart? Give me a break.

628,jim159,"New meets Old, with some differences and improvements",6,23 July 2009,"Having seen all Friday the 13th films, my expectations for this film were high. This film was always going to face a lot of criticism given that it is a remake of one of the most legendary horror films of modern times. However it is difficult not to compare it with the original Friday The 13th given it's lack of originality, but for me I wasn't looking for a new plot, I wanted to see an improved version of the original and I got it.I think this film deserves a lot more credit than many reviewers on IMDb are giving it. Friday The 13th succeeds where the original and most horror films of it's time and now failed. Most horror films now are so predictable, you can almost guess who will be killed next, when they'll be killed and even how and its nearly always the sound effects/music that give it away. In Friday The 13th, however, sound effects create a sense of tension for the viewer where there is none. Some will argue this is a cheap attempt to create tension where they couldn't produce a scene to do so. I would argue its creating a feeling of unpredictability for the viewer, which again most horror films fail to produce now, and it succeeded because you really don't see some of the killings coming and while they may not necessarily make the viewer jump or scared, there is a feeling of shock or surprise because you didn't see it coming.Another thing that ruined so many horror films of this era and before was the running scene. I always cringed watching victims run for their life as their killer strolled along at snails pace, yet still managed to catch up with them. I was always left thinking, how? But that all changes in this film, where we see Jason run after his victims if they do manage to escape in time. It makes the character, but in particular the scene more convincing and realistic.In the original Friday The 13th films, there was also a kind of experimentation with how victims were killed, which again made the viewer wonder if someone could actually be killed like that. This film doesn't bother with that, its just simple, cold blooded murder and the viewer is left in no doubt that Jason's methods are capable of killing someone.There are also plenty of twists and turns along the way to keep the viewer interested and on the edge of their seat, and while the plot itself is much the same as the original, how it is developed isn't and for me thats what made it interesting.But for all the improvements this remake brings to the original film, it is let down by the poor acting which seems to be a common letdown with most remakes these days, with some exceptions such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Some of the characters I found very annoying to listen to, maybe that was the intention of the writers, to turn the viewer against them, but for me I think the script could've been improved and the characters more developed.Overall I'd give this film a 6 out of 10. Its well worth the watch, and the perfect horror flick for a Friday night in, but don't expect too much from it.",Friday the 13th

The death scenes were just as inventive as they were in the original films, but the character of Jason wasn't there. They say that this time they made him ""smarter"", but if you pay attention to the original films, Jason was already pretty smart and he did ""set them up"" in those films as well.

They were going to show the origins of 'how' Jason started using the hockey mask. Uhm, excuse me, but did they NOT see Part III which CLEARLY shows how and why he started using the hockey mask? Apparently, not but they were still hired to make the movie. We were promised the 'origins' of Jason and all we got was a half-attempted beginning that really didn't explain much at all. For a newcomer to the Friday The 13th lore, a newcomer wouldn't have known what that was even about in this so-called 're-imagining'. This is cemented when the campfire Jason story is interrupted thus a newcomer still wouldn't know anything about the origins of Jason. Yet they were still hired to make this movie. They were hired, in part, by Producer Michael Bay who walked out during the first screening saying there was 'too much sex'... LOL! Of course there was. This IS Friday The 13th for camper's sake! I'm betting he didn't read the script. Shoot, I know he didn't because he would've seen then there was, in his words, too much sex. But he didn't know until the film was made and he was watching it for the first time? Gimme a break! He just heard the name brand and put his money up without even reading a script and that's his own stupidity, imho. The editing was beyond bad. The actors were all very capable here. When Jared P. & Danielle P. got on that motorcycle to go to the other side of the lake, I was thinking ""man I hope they're gonna ride onto another movie set and skip this one!"".. But, of course they didn't. But overall, if this were the first Ft13 that someone ever saw, then this 're-imagining' has left them confused as to what Jason's mother actually did and why Jason does. Jason, here, on the other hand was the one redeeming character in this mess. He was relentless, to say the least and had the script been better and done with more suspenseful editing, Jason would've been a force to be reckoned (sic) with! But he didn't have much to work with. As for that hockey mask. He found it in a barn. Wow! That mystery has finally been solved (sarcasm alert)! How was that any better than when he found the mask in Part 3? It wasn't. Then in another barn, there was even more hockey equipment. Now where do you suppose all these 'hockey playing pot farmers' actually play hockey at? I thought it would be near impossible to make a bad Ft13, but all involved here have achieved that and then some. It had to be harder for them to do this bad, so maybe they should get some kudos...lol And the one thing that really ticked me off: Where was the obligatory VW Beetle? It's been in all the Fthe13th's and they missed an opportunity to use the NEW VW. Shame...lol This was Part 12, not a re-imagining unless they have no imagination. :) Also, why does the music sound more like the 'Terminator score' than Harry Mancinis' original score. And Jason does NOT take hostages. He just doesn't. And the hostage here ('Whitney') has been tied up for 6 weeks inside Jason's cabin. Yet, her very clean shirt is still nicely tucked in and her finger nails nicely manicured. She had also obviously been eating good. What did she eat? Human flesh? And how did she maintain that 'kick-your-ass' spirit for 6 strait weeks without freaking out. Maybe it was all those manicures that calmed her? I think there were just too many cooks in the kitchen on this one. And by calling it just 'Friday The 13th' they've screwed themselves on being able to call the next one, the 13th one, which could've been called 'Friday THE 13th' but now that's shot down. And we still don't know anything about Mr. Voorhees! They could've at least had him in an asylum, having his way with that nun, Miss Krueger ;P (i'm only half-serious on that last statement) And instead of showing us AGAIN where the hockey mask came from, they could've used that time to show us who taught Jason how to drive in Ft13th Part 2 ;P Just saying...lol Peace",Friday the 13th
632,nthompson,"Zero imagination, zero fun",1,13 February 2009,"It's hard to believe a ""Friday"" film has been made that's even more worthless than Part VIII, but they did it. Kicking off with one of the phoniest severed heads ever committed to film and then trudging through a string of dull, slapdash kill scenes (you'll be able to think of at least five better alternatives every time someone gets offed), this film seems to think that throwing in lots of pot smoking and really, really hideous silicone boob shots will be enough. It isn't. Not even close. Even worse, the film is incredibly callous and nasty to its cast (and its audience), using a parent's cancer death as an excuse to send one sibling after his missing sister, only to subject them to relentless torture and a pointless shock ending blatantly swiped from The New Blood. Oh yeah, and how can they have TWO characters get attacked by Jason in a huge, packed tool shed and only come up with... well, see for yourself and groan at the missed opportunities.

633,Jeremy_wehoaks_fan,A pretty fun and entertaining movie.,9,30 April 2010,"Being a rabid fan of the original series, I was thrilled to see Jason brought back to his roots in this movie, especially after those disasters called ""Jason Goes to Hell"" and ""Jason X."" Finally we get to see Jason back in his old stomping grounds, hacking up the teenage populace of Crystal Lake, where he belongs.I think the filmmakers stayed true to the roots of the series by incorporating the main ingredients that made those movies so much fun: horny teenagers, drugs, and lots of killing. We all know this isn't Shakespeare and it doesn't have to be.The plot is basically a combination of parts 1-4 of the original series. Jenna and her friends head out to her douchebag boyfriend's cabin for a weekend of sex, drugs, and partying, and the cabin just happens to be located on, you guessed it, Crystal Lake. Jason enters the scene shortly thereafter and begins with the dispatching. Not the most original plot, but like I said, we're not expecting miracles here.The teenagers in this remake did tend to be on the annoying side at times, and I felt there was perhaps a bit too much sex (it just felt overdone), but otherwise I think this is a pretty solid entry in the ""Friday the 13th"" canon. It is certainly the best looking movie in the franchise to date. The cinematography is beautiful, and Crystal Lake and its surroundings look excellent.I would have preferred a bit more stalk-and-slash as opposed to the ""GOTCHA!"" jump scares the movie was fond of, and while I wouldn't call it a scary film, it was entertaining nonetheless.If you go into it just looking to have fun, you won't be disappointed. I found this to be a very fun, entertaining 90 minutes. The story is simple, the characters are stereotypical, and yes it is a film about a guy in a hockey mask hacking kids up, but hey...it's just a fun type of movie. Perfect to pop in the DVD player on a night when you're at home with nothing to do.",Friday the 13th
634,filmscores1971,Camp Crystal Dud....,2,13 February 2009,"Camp Crystal DudI felt the opening was rushed, and watching the fight between Mrs. Voorhees and Alice would have been awesome. This movie played out like Michael Myers wearing a hockey mask and the music sounded like a mix of the Halloween remake, Saw, and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre... I find it interesting that the reviews indicate they are trying to breathe new life to the franchise.... maybe for a new breed of horror fans, but those who are fans of the originals, will find that it lacks in scares...Harry Manfredini's score was very much missed....",Friday the 13th
635,rodrigokombat,Friday the 13th (2009),9,15 August 2015,"One of the scary movies most anticipated of 2009 was certainly the remake / reboot of ""Friday the 13th"". The opinion of the fans was completely divided between those who loved and hated it, but the box office records showed that Jason still has a lot of potential ...The film's story is simple (as always) and, according to the time line of the original franchise, starts showing the events of the end of the first film. The confrontation between Alice and Pamela, Jason's mother. A very interesting take, as well as guiding those who do not know the story, adds something that is not shown in the original 1980. Jason was there and witnessed the death of his mother.After this first part, the film still has one more division and, first, shows a first youth, but they will still be the main victims. After sending to the bag all (or most) of this group, we are finally presented for the main course. Which is pretty much the same group of young people and a biker looking for his sister (who was in the first wave of bodies). Needless to say, the blood rolls loose ...According to producers, the film would not be retelling the story of the original, but joining the stories of the first four films in one. Because they thought that fans of the series would not want to see Jason's mother, the fans wanted to see LEGEND live again. And they had full reason. The course of the remake, directed by Marcus Nispel great, we see numerous accolades and has known deaths.A point which angered fans, was that Jason keep a victim in captivity. I found it quite appropriate, has reasons for this to happen and to the ""Part 2"" of the original franchise, had used this idea (but in the remake it is enlarged). Another situation that caused discomfort was the fact that Jason run (yes, he runs ... runs more than me). I must admit I enjoyed seeing Jason running and hunting, a real predator in the woods of Crystal Lake.Another thing that anyone says is that rescued the best of the first killer movies hockey mask. It is difficult to identify who will be the surviving girl, the script deceives us and I found it very cool. Not to mention the film, which reverts to ""surprising"", with Jason making his comeback, pulling a string.",Friday the 13th
636,jmorri93,A VERY underrated remake,9,20 September 2013,"This remake or (reboot) of Friday the 13th was excellent! I honestly don't understand why it got all the hate it did. It's pretty much the same as all the other Friday's except it's in the modern day. I love the new Jason. He's a more smart and calculating killer than in the originals. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE all of the Jason's. I've been a die hard Jason fan since i was 5, it's just that this new Jason to me is cooler. The characters are good in this one too. People complained that the characters were awful, but I mean, come one, it's a Friday THE 13TH movie. Do you honestly expect academy award winning performances?No. I'm not saying that the acting has to be awful, it's just, I'm not expecting a whole lot out of them. And also, it's a slasher film, you kind of have to expect the stereotypical characters, the asshole, the funny guy, the slut, etc. The death scenes were all awesome. I saw some homages to the originals, which made me smile. All of the deaths were nice and gory. I love how the new Jason runs. A lot of people don't like this because they liked the ""zombie"" Jason from part 6 and on and how he just walked. To me, the running aspect is scarier because to me, it causes you're adrenaline to rush and that's exactly what happened to me. It's a lot like the Jason from parts 2-4. I just hope that there will be a sequel to this more awesome storyline.",Friday the 13th
637,deepblue_rd,Not bad,5,14 February 2009,I went to see this remake last night and wasn't impressed. It felt like watching the Texas chainsaw massacre again.The characters in the film were very good and I enjoyed them. There was good comedy which helped. The deaths were OK but lacked something Im not sure what. He also could have used the Machete more. The ending was good but I felt it was rushed right at the very end.I think that they should have stuck with the team that did Jason in Freddy VS Jason.Overall its a decent film to watch but I think fans of Jason mite be disappointed.,Friday the 13th
638,SmileyCafe,Don't mess with Jason's stash,7,4 April 2020,"I'm pretty sure I saw this movie when it came out, but I just watched it on Netflix and now that I'm an adult the movie makes alot more sense. Instead of the supernatural hellspawn that he was in the original franchise, Jason is now just a regular guy who had a rough childhood and is trying to make a living by growing a little herb. Unfortunately, entitled frat boys and their arm candy entourage keep raiding his stash. Justifiably, he gets pretty  and decides to put a stop to it.Virgin smokers/the uninitiated might not catch any of this, so here's a breakdown of the plot:The movie starts with a flashback of Jason's mom getting decapitated. Jason watched it happen and apparently it messed him up pretty badly. The movie then jumps to the present where Jason is kicking it in his mom's old house. Unable to get over the traumatic experience of watching his mom die, Jason has remained near the place where he grew up. In order to ease his pain, Jason started growing ganja in the woods near his pad. Over time Jason became a master grower and college parties all over northern California were being fueled by Jason's killer herb. Unfortunately for Jason, he slipped about the location of his grow op to the wrong person, and soon stoners everywhere were hatching plans to raid his legendarily potent strains. Many people go missing during their quest for Jason's bud, but the stuff is so dank that more keep trying.Enter the first group of stoners, who are on a mission to do just that. While burning one out in the woods, the Seth Rogan smoker goes out to take a leak and ends up urinating by one of Jason's plants. After he relieves himself, he realizes that he's completely surrounded by Mary Jane. Though he knew Jason's stuff was good, he has a short bout of hysteria when he realizes that he has just come across Jason's tier 1 personal stash. It's pretty clear the dude planned on jacking the plants and smoking out his Bros back at the camp.Jason saw all of this going on and flipped his lid. For those of you who don't know, dealers like Jason aren't usually the sharing type. They are tired of people thinking that they should always get a free rip just because the dealer has a fat stash in his safe. On top of that, the dude just peed on his upcoming harvest. Jason starts seeing red out of his one good eye, the other having been lost to glaucoma, and pulls a Mike Tyson on Seth Rogans ear. In his fury, Jason hangs up the ear on a nearby cola as a warning to anyone else who would try to raid his stash.The warning doesn't work, and a few minutes later another member of stoner group one comes looking for the bud. He finds Jason's plants along with the ear and realizes all to late that stealing from someone's grow out in the isolated woods wasn't a good idea, even if it's high times cover page worthy.Homeboy runs back to the camp, but ends up stepping in a bear trap that Jason had placed to protect his crop. Jason, still enraged at the thought of his herb tasting like human pee, instead of the cat pee that it was supposed to, realizes that if any of them gets away they will come back and raid his stash. After the bud rot that ruined half of his last crop, Jason can't let this happen. His personal supply is running low and he's the type of guy that really needs to be medicated 24/7. So, he brutally murders the whole group, except for a girl that he locks in his basement and tortures, to send a message to others not to mess with his plants.This works for awhile, but then some local guy smells Jason's crop because the odor is so dank that it carries for miles around. Jason notices and decides to take revenge. First though, Jason decides to spy on the guy to make sure that he's not dea or part of some organized crime group. While he's watching, the dude from supernatural, who is basement girls brother, comes to question the local stoner about his sister's whereabouts. The guy hasn't seen her, but he offers to sell supernatural some of Jason's weed that he had just jacked. Knowing that he is a catatonic smoker and that he would be couch locked for weeks based on the stink alone, he turns it down and leaves to keep looking for his sister. As soon as he is gone, Jason takes his revenge on the local stoner and offs him. He also realizes that supernatural guy now knows too much about his grow, so he follows him to the cabin inhabited by stoner group two.Plot wise, the rest of the movie is pretty much filler up until the final moment where Jason has a show down with supernatural and his sister. After seemingly defeating Jason and having his herb all to themselves, the two siblings are burning one on a dock when Jason springs out of the water and punches through the dock, presumably so that he can get a toke in before it's all ashed. This is where the movie ends.To most people, Jason's motivations during the film probably didn't make much sense. Hopefully my review helps to make sense of this stoner slasher reboot for those not living in recreational use states.",Friday the 13th

Not one to take on a project and complete it as mediocre, he did what no one thought was possible these days; make an entertaining horror film.His adaptation of Texas Chainsaw Massacre was good, but he definitely honed his skills and hit a home run with Friday the 13th.Maybe Rob Zombie should consult with Bay before trying to redo any more Halloween movies.....",Friday the 13th
641,dsshaw,A good date movie,7,11 February 2009,"You're in a crowded theater, and the girl next to you is holding her breath. Her hands are covering her eyes and then fingers plugging her ears. Down low in her seat she squeaks, and then startles at the action on the screen. White knuckles clutching his arm, she buries her head in her boyfriend's shoulder.This is why you bring your date to a horror movie on Valentine's Day.The problem with a remake is it can be impossible not to judge it based on the genre standard that is the original. Try all we want, but we have to start there. This isn't a remake so much as a re-imagining, and is a continuation of the original lore. There are subtle, and not-so-subtle, references that will please the most avid fans while anyone seeing it for the first time won't feel like they've been left out.I'm a fan of the American horror movie, and this movie has everything you've come to expect: gore, nudity, a hero girl, the jerk who gets it, the tool shed, the hero coming out of the birth canal, stoner guys, a machete, an ax, and more sex. The only thing I found a little disappointing was the ""hero boy."" Not quite ""average Joe"" enough.The movie starts at the end of the original, and then quickens the pace. The gore was delightfully disgusting, but I would have enjoyed it if there was more. The girl sitting next to me obviously thought there was plenty. The tempo in the middle of the film isn't sluggish, moving right along without feeling hurried. There are plenty of laughs, and it was a delight to hear five or six girls scattered throughout the theater shriek in unison near the end of the film. Just when you think the end is going to disappoint compared to the rest of the film, it finished solidly.A date movie worth the price of the tickets.",Friday the 13th

I don't really get scared in movies but I really like getting that fright for a moment or two. This film didn't have a lot of intense scenes that make you jump and give you that frightening feeling. Jason was just there, behind every person. you could always see him. he didn't just appear out of nowhere and leave you shocked, like killers in other slasher movies do. There wasn't any mystery like there is in slasher films like I Know What You Did Last Summer or a Nightmare On Elm Street. I can't compare it with the original because I haven't watched it, but something tells me the original would've probably been better. It wasn't a really bad movie, but it wasn't good either. Of course, some people might find it frightening. I believe it really depends on the taste that people have. It could have received a 7 from me if Danielle Panabaker's character (Jenna) wouldn't have died (or at least died last). I really liked the ending (as I do in all horror movies with a similar ending) how Jason returns once more and gives space for another sequel. This ending is really common in slashers and I really like the effect that it gives to the viewers. The other thing that I didn't like was how they spent like 5 minutes on the sex scene.

It don't deserve all the hate fan say about it. I'm a old Friday the 13th fan and i liked this movie. They change a few thing and it's different than making the same movie over and over again. At least it's cool to be able to go see a Friday the 13th movie in theater in 2009 and it can bring a new younger crowd for this genre.

645,joshuapcorns,What a huge letdown.,3,14 February 2009,"Being a huge fan since I was a kid of the Friday the 13th series., I had high hopes and great expectations for this remake. Especially considering it was done by the Bay / Nispel team of The TCM remake in 04 which was to me, an AMAZING REMAKE! The TCM remake is one of the only few films that actually ""scared"" me.So, 5 years later we have the Bay/ Nispel team back, except this time, to me it was a letdown. I think the biggest problem with the remake in my opinion is that first of all, Jason just looked goofy with the curly hair, and various other visual elements on his character. Second, the Friday The 13th franchise is obviously not out to win any Oscars, so the only reason one would usually go to a Jason Voorhees kill-fest is exactly that, to see the creatively beautiful ways he finds to barbarically butcher people. There were a few original death scenes, but overall, the way Jason killed people was quick, lame, and lacked much blood. Maybe Nispel was afraid of the almighty MPAA and their all too-quick tendencies to NC-17 the hell out of every movie these days. I don't know.Bottom line, any true F13th fan will tell you Kane Hodder IS JASON VOORHEES, splitting someone in half while they're having sex IS A WAY TO KILL SOMEONE (A-LA Jason Goes To Hell), not with a stupid screwdriver, or a machete every 15 seconds (like in this remake).I am very disappointed. 3 out of 10 stars.",Friday the 13th

Boring, not really that scary. If you think violence is scary, though, then this movie would be terrifying. There is a LOT of swearing and nudity, and they don't really censor anything. Women are shown without they're tops, and many, MANY, sexual references. The characters weren't that good either, nor the script. They tried to force in so many stupid jokes, it's just sad. I especially hated that part where the black guy (goddammit I already forgot most of the names) was telling the girl about the song genre he was doing. He gives this speech about stereotypes of black people doing raps, and them tells her that he does rap. It was so stupid. There were a few good characters, like Aaron Yoo's character. He was definitely the funniest character, but he himself pulled off some stupid jokes. I liked Jared Padalecki and Amanda Righetti's characters, they were probably the only decent ones.Bottom line, I don't recommend this.

I thought it was a brilliant beginning up to the title. It had some goods deaths and they had the token dork explaining a little about the legend of Crystal Lake. This was for the people that don't know about the Friday the 13th movies. It gets a little slow and boring after that when we get to know the other cast members. Not a lot of chemistry for my liking.

Its almost like they've never seen a horror movie before. The more dialog and character growth a movie has the more ""horror"" and ""gore"" the movie losses. It will also lose the more casual young adult viewer.Now onto the movie, Friday the 13th accomplishes what it sets out to do, it keeps you entertained for its entire run time and gives you a few jolts and surprises. Where the movie does seem to stray away from the atmosphere the originals established it doesn't stray very far and is actually a welcome change that puts fresh air in a once stale franchise. Its also welcoming that the movie isn't a remake. . .perse. The movie doesn't discredit anything that's happened in the previous films but rather make them part of the film's back story. Die-hard fans may be a little disappointed at the ""new"" Jason but the more realistic spin on him is very good. I enjoyed watching him actually run rather than walk and I also enjoyed the quicker kills. Seeing somebody run through a forest for every death only stays good for so long. The film is entertaining, has creative deaths, a very sexy supporting actress, and will keep you glued from start to finish.

I've been a fan of the series since I was 9 or 10yrs old, and have all the films and consider myself to be a pretty big fan of the series.Does that mean I didn't like this film? If you listen to ""real fans"" you can't call yourself a true fan if you liked which is a little elitist imo. Was the film a masterpiece? No it wasn't, it had it's faults. While the Friday films were never known for great dialogue, this films dialogue made even the most cringeworth dialogue from the other films(part5 f**k you, yeah f**k me in particular) seem Shakespearean in comparison. The characters aren't the best either, but which film had great characters in it? The acting and dialogue is about on par with the rest of the series and who watches these movies for Oscar contenders anyway? I agree the whole taking a prisoner thing was a little hockey but there was a reason why he did so and if you paid attention to the film you'll know that.Jason runs, well he did run in Parts 2,3&4 as well so it's no biggie. It's surprising that these ""real fans"" conveniently forget that. Real fans? More like fans of Kane Hodder's Jason(not that I'm criticising Kane, he was great) who did lumber around. This is a different Jason, he doesen't have to mimmick Kane Hodder as awesome as he was in the role.Is it on the same level as some of the earlier Friday's? No, it's definitely not as great as the first 4, but a lot better than part8.I wouldn't call this a remake, a remake of which film? The first? Then why isn't it Jason's mom doing the killing? The others? Well if you say that because it has Jason running around killing you could say that all the films are a remake of part2.And it's not really a reboot like Batman and Bond(which no it's not another word for remake. What's Casino Royale remaking? The 60's comedy?) Perhaps just another entry in the series that's been called a remake because it's called Friday the 13th but in fact it isn't a remake of the first film because the set-up and such isn't even close to the original.

They took Jason and turned him into a cerebral, kick-ass, slaughtering machine. Now, I'm a die-hard Jason fan, but none of the Friday the 13th's were ever actually ""good"" movies. The stories and characters were always the same, and we only ever watched them to see Jason do his thing. This movie is no different. You have the jock, the hero, the nerds, and the girls. The story means absolutely nothing to anyone. All we want to see is Jason do his thing, and he does. The only thing that's lacking is more gore. I definitely think this movie could have been more bloody seeing how the MPAA isn't as uptight as it once was. But that's just me. Grab some popcorn and check it out!",Friday the 13th
652,mattandrebecca1,"Maybe not a complete waste of time, but almost.",3,15 February 2009,"I should have known better. Texas Chainsaw Massacre, good remake. Halloween, decent remake. Friday the 13 the, mind numbingly awful, and that's sad because it had potential. This is the first time I have been frustrated enough to post a review of a film (and I've watched a lot of bad films), in hopes that a lover of the genre and franchise will not end up as dismayed as I. First of all, I understand that a certain amount of T&A is commonplace in most slasher movies, I've been a fan for 30 years; however, the amount of sex and attempted humor simply slow down and hinder this film. It's like they thought, whoops it's been awhile I guess we should kill someone real quick so we can get back to the bongs and boobs, but don't bother making it very original. And in the end, you feel like the Nispel realized he only had 15 minutes left in the film, and so they should rush to actually address the bad guy. Intersperse the sex with lame humor, and even worse dialogue, and you get a mixture of one of the new National Lampoon's movies, and a boring horror movie. As for Jared Padalecki, I'm surprised because I've watched scarier, better episodes of Supernatural. Maybe I'm just getting older, but ""Friday the 13th"" and ""Underworld:Rise of the Lycans"" should have gone straight to video. I could have done better. Others did, and with way less money.",Friday the 13th
653,MiraiEnder,Surprisingly my second Favorite,7,9 June 2015,"WARNING, MINOR SPOILERS...MAYBEOK, As we all know, Hollywood has gone way over the deep end with remakes,We all know about disasters like The Wicker Man, Nightmare on Elm Street, and Psycho remakes. But! There are some that are pretty good. I really enjoyed The Fly remake, and I enjoyed this remake. Not to say this is perfect, far from it, but this is a fun one, and does something that was forgotten about in the sequels. A protagonist. Anyways, there are plenty of kills. There are unenjoyable characters of course. But we get a cool protagonist, Clay, who is looking for his sister who disappeared. He is determined and focused. Plus, it's Jared Padalecki, what could go wrong? Jason is different here, he is smarter, And, to be honest, I don't mind it. It makes him more awesome. I really enjoyed this movie!",Friday the 13th
654,texasfencer,Intimidating,10,17 February 2009,"After it was announced that the ""makers of Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Ammityville Horror"" were remaking it, I was a little nervous to see it. I like the director's style, but I thought it was a little high and mighty to claim those previous films as if he'd made the originals. If he was going to screw this up like Rob Zombie did Halloween, what would we be left with? Lord knows that won't ever be the same again. But I have to say, Jason blew us all away when he hit that big screen for the first time in six years. They gave us everything a Jason fan wanted to see and more. This film didn't break any of the old rules set up by previous Fridays, and yet it took a genuine turn back into the direction of when Jason was just a mad man running around in the woods. But he was smart this time- he was quick, and he was freakishly angry! If you weren't scared (or just aren't scared) by the jump-in-your-seat scare tactics of this film, you will be intimidated by Jason Voorhees altogether. Stoners and perverts will be happy too!But please, leave your kids at home for this one. No one wants that complex for twenty years.",Friday the 13th
655,cygnusx2,Not very good at all,2,14 February 2009,"LAME - and a huge disappointment after all the hype. It has the feel of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake, including some of the color pallet, which is stupid - this is Friday the 13th, not Texas Chainsaw. My friend and I (long time Friday fans) were laughing at this film - is Jason killing these people to protect his weed farm? You smoke Jason's stash and he's going to kill you! There's so much bad dialogue and plot elements that stretch credibility (and for a Friday film that's saying something). It's hard to believe that it took 3 people to write this. Maybe Jason sells his weed to pay the electric bill to power the huge spotlights around the broken down camp? He obviously has had some commando training since he now sets traps, is an expert marksman with the bow and arrow and has tunneled out a whole underground cave system underneath the Voorhees place.The musical score is a phone-in job by Steve Jablonsky, very uninspired and unexciting. Some of the kills were good and some were just OK, but what's with the fake-looking flesh bulge on the right side of Jason's neck? I really didn't enjoy this much at all (I didn't even think the first 20 minutes were all that great, either). Someone should have stopped this back at the script-writing stage and said ""Back to the drawing board, people"". REBOOT? More like DELETE.",Friday the 13th
656,lennylehnertz,This is terrible,1,13 February 2009,"This movie is the absolute worst I have ever seen. If you are a fan of the original series, and by that I mean the Paramount releases, then don't waste your time. The whole claim that this movie is a combination of the first few movies is completely false. What they did was gear it toward people who are entertained by MTV. The movie is nothing but an updated version of Texas Chainsaw Massacre with Jason replacing Leatherface. However, it doesn't stop there. Jason has electricity in this one. He is able to maintain light bulbs. Apparently all that time Jason spent growing up in the woods was not wasted. Not only is he a licensed electrician, but he also is quite good at engineering having dug his own mine/tunnel. Now here come the people who say, ""You are an idiot no one pays that much attention"", but if you had watched the originals you would realize that not a lot of thinking should be involved. In closing, if you enjoyed Saw, Thirteen Ghosts, or the Butterfly Effect then you will enjoy this film. May God have mercy on your soul. They have finally stained all of the good film series. 3 stars...out of 1000.",Friday the 13th
657,packtherac,my take on this NEW installment of Friday the 13th ***SPOILERS INCLUDED***,5,17 February 2009,"*****SPOILERS******* YOU'VE BEEN WARNEDWow. Where do I begin?As someone who considers himself a FT13 aficionado from way back, I had mixed feelings about this ""re imagined"" FT13. 10 minutes into the flick, I knew then and there that this is actually the restarting of the FT13 series. Nothing more, nothing less.The movie does a fairly good job of paying a good nod to several storyline elements from the original series first 4 installments and I was glad(although I felt my age)when I was able to pick up on them. It also added a twist to the sleeping bag kills that we've seen on 3 occasions in the previous franchise although this one was a little ""hotter"" if you know what I mean.The female nudity was great. Hey, I'm almost 34 but it never gets old and these twenty something chicks were great. Bree? OMG!!! Never did a better pair of breasts grace a Mr.Voorhees film. My only complaints were lack of the original background music from the ""holy 4""(as they will be forever known) and also there just seemed to be a lack of buildup and suspense, at least to me, but today's generation wants their action and they want it fast and in their face. The kills were BRUTAL, but come on, a bow and arrow?! Okay, maybe it's for the new generation, but my Jason didn't have to use such nonsense.There will be sequels to this re imagined installment and I truly hope what worked for the 1st franchise, up until A NEW BEGINNING, will work better for this franchise and we can see Jason on the screen for a few more years. I and others now must step aside, cherish what was OUR franchise and now let the younger horror fans enjoy their FT13 franchise. I like what I see so far, just needs a little tweaking.The nods to the Holy 4 were: 1-Wade's campfire story (Paul Holt's campfire story) 2-the finding of Mrs.Voorhees head 3-Clay looking for his sister (Rob Dyer searching for his sister Sandra) 4-Jason's bandaged look(nod to part 2's look) 5-sleeping bag death (the older ones were better IMO) 6-the cabin where the kids were (part 3 nod) 7-Whitney with the charm telling Jason it's okay (Ginny Field nod part 2-gotta admit it, I loved this!!!) 8-Jason coming through the window for Clay (see Tommy Jarvis in TFC) 9-hanging Jason (nod to Chris in part 3)Again, not bad, but this is the new FT13 for today's generation. Please don't make the same mistakes that OUR franchise made with the last few movies and thank you for the nods to the Holy 4. May THEY reign for ever! Jolly good show. Will buy on DVD.",Friday the 13th
658,lucaskvs,Exploitation through sequels,3,7 January 2013,"This movie was full of clichés (as one would expect), but was it any different from the previous Friday the 13th movies? I didn't think so. What is this fascination with sequels, especially one that is devoid of any imagination? I love movies of all genres, be it thriller, comedy, action, drama, or horror. But I find it sad that the studios exploit audience's love for a hit movie through sequels just to make more money (I guess, that's the whole point of making movies). It's either sequels or reboots, and most of them are terrible. I can accept Nolan's use of sequels to complete Batman's story but I do not understand the whole point of a Spiderman reboot just a few years after Raimi's Spiderman. At least 'Scary movie' franchise makes fun of different movies in its sequels, keeping it fresh.But to a certain extent, the audience have to be blamed for lapping up such movies, thus encouraging producers to continue to churn out crappy sequels.",Friday the 13th
659,rwcalsetta,A Homage with Risks,8,4 September 2018,"Rob Zombie said it correctly when commenting on why he wanted to move away from his Halloween franchise stating that no matter what he did there would be detractors. So it shouldn't be surprising that Friday the 13th (2009) would have a slew of negative reviews. Was there any way the writer/director was going to win?
However, if you can detach your nostalgia glasses and take the film for what it is there is some enjoyment here. Brutal death scenes, a powerhouse antagonist, bare-breasted girls and their frat-boy counterparts, ill-fated parties, and some funny moments peppered in; all the right ingredients to make a slasher film (and certainly a better film than Jason X). And yet instead of playing it safe this film takes some risks with the character that actually work well with the pre-established story. So why all the hate? Besides a few scenes that did nothing to aid the story and came off as an excuse for humor or breasts, the typical 30-something-teenagers, and a couple out-of-place characters with no payoff the film really is the best Jason movie we've gotten in longer than a decade. Sure it has its flaws, but it's still miles above any Purge sequel or Conjuring prequel we are currently being served once a year. Not to mention Derek Mears is a force to be reckoned with that made Jason something to be feared and isn't that the most important part?",Friday the 13th
660,tilgnerale,Great movie,9,14 April 2018,I mostly love this movie for Jared padalecki. It kinda reminds me of the episode in SUPERNATURAL about the windeego. But it's a pretty good horror movie,Friday the 13th
661,jcage05,Not Jason...,3,14 February 2009,"This movie was just like any other slasher movie ever made. They modernized it in such a way that made true Friday The 13th fans want to puke. I understand that cramming 4 movies potentially into 1 may be somewhat difficult. But, the way they went about it was unbelievably wrong. For instance, Rob Zombie's Halloween remake was different than the original in regards to the character's childhood. But that's it! Everything else in that movie was bigger, and better but the same exact feel as the old one. This new slasher they've made (because I refuse to call this a Friday the 13th film) felt just like Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Which, isn't surprising considering it's the same director. The deaths were decent and had very cool elements to them. Other than that, this was not worth the money whatsoever. I recommend that any hardcore Friday the 13th fan stay away from this movie because I can guarantee you will be disappointed. This movie makes you want to go back and re-watch the first 4 just to get out of your mind what Michael Bay, Marcus Nispel, Paramount, Derek Mears, etc. have done to this franchise. Simply stunning. Hollywood is fired.",Friday the 13th
662,TheRockyHorrorBreakfastClub,Just watch the original one,3,5 July 2021,"As a fan of this franchise and horror movies in general, I was excited for this one. And sadly, I was disappointed to say the least...My absolute biggest problem with this movie were the characters. They're so incredibly unlikeable. And the main friend group (which feels more like 3 pairs who just happen to know each other) seem to share that opinion, it feels like no-one in this group likes each other except from their respective ""partner"" (and even that doesn't seem to be the case with Jenna and Trent). I absolutely hated Trent, Nolan and Chelsea. Lawrence was extremely forgettable. Whitney was forgettable too, which is weird because the plot kinda revolved around her. The only characters I liked were Jenna and Chewie. While Clay was just a weird character in my eyes, I still don't know if I liked him or hated his guts. The characters made dumb, annoying and unrealistic decisions. For example; at the end when Clay and Whitney make it out of that bus, they hide instead of running away while they're perfectly capable to do so. Or when they throw Jason's corpse in the lake where he drowned.I also hate the fact that the movie basically wastes 20 minutes of your time by introducing 5, and killing 4 (in a pretty boring manner), uninteresting characters.Another problem I stumbled upon was the cinematography of certain scenes. It was just really hard to make out what was happening at certain points, just because of how it was filmed. For example, when Jason attacks Lawrence it was hard to make out who stabbed who (in the garage).Other things that annoyed me: bad dialogue in certain scenes, overused movie tropes, the jumpscares were plain bad, most kills were boring as hell and I didn't like this Jason as much as I liked the original one.This movie had 2 things I actually really liked. The first one was Amanda's death (by being tied up in a sleeping bag over a campfire), it was somewhat original and surprising. And the fact that they killed off Jenna, I really expected that she would survive it because she was the sweet, innocent one.In short: A bad reboot of a classic franchise, with really unlikeable and annoying characters, that leaves a lot to be desired. Just avoid this one and re-watch the original one.",Friday the 13th
663,panicatthekai,Does the Reboot Work?,8,14 February 2009,"It's 2009 and here we have the ""Friday the 13th"" reboot. I saw my first Jason movie when I was at the wee age of 4 (I'm 19 now), so I basically grew up with the guy. I've always been a huge fan of the series, despite some of the crappy sequels like ""Jason Takes Manhattan"" and the everlasting crap fest ""Jason X"". So in short, this reboot was desperately needed. ""Friday the 13th (2009)"" is more of an homage to the first 3 films and little bit from ""Part VII: The New Blood"". Mrs. Voorhees' beheading is recreated, we see Jason initially wearing a potato sack on his head just like in Part II, we see him discovering his hockey mask just as he does in Part III, and many of his kills are redone but with new twists on them. Most memorably his sleeping bag kill, which I know for a fact is a fan favorite since it has been used in 3 ""Friday"" films. All that is great stuff, but the main question is this: Is this reboot any good? My answer is simply yes. Everything was done extremely well. The thing that really makes this movie shine is Jason's newly found skills. He's a finely tuned hunter now. It's almost as if Mrs. Voorhees and Rambo had a baby and named him Jason. He's faster, leaner, he sets up traps, has his own lair, and even holds a hostage. My main problem with the original ""Friday"" films was the fact that Jason lived in the woods so long but never really acquired any other skills besides killing. The creators of this movie sat down and said, ""Hey, so this guy has been living in the woods for 30 some odd years and he doesn't have any type of skills? That's not gonna work. We have to implement some survivor skills into this guy"". Well I don't know what they said exactly, but I imagine it went something like that. The only real complaint I have about this movie is the ending. Obviously Jason lives, no real spoilers there, but that's not what I'm talking about. It's what the characters do with his body that I thought was really idiotic. But I digress. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and it was great to see Jason again on the silver screen. I'm ready for a sequel or even another Freddy vs. Jason!",Friday the 13th
