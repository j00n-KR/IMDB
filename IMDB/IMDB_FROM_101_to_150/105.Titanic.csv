0,MartinHafer,My review is this film's 2400th....so what more can I say?!,9,30 March 2013,"""Titanic"" won a bazillion Oscars and is considered a classic by many. And, it now (counting this one) has 2400 reviews. So, what more can I say about this film that hasn't already been said? Well, very little--that is why this review is rather short.I give the film a 9 because it isn't perfect. Some of the characters, to me, seemed a bit simplistic. But, no matter if you like them or not, there's no denying the awesomeness of the film. After all, it looks like you are on a huge cruise ship and the special effects of the wreck (this isn't exactly a spoiler!) are amazing. So, like the story or not, the film is staggering to watch--particularly on a big screen. And, now that I think about this, this is exactly how I viewed director Cameron's other huge success, ""Avatar"". Well worth seeing once.",Titanic
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Very ambitious, but beautifully filmed and acted.",8,3 June 2009,"I had few problems with this film, and I have heard a lot of criticisms saying it is overlong and overrated. True, it is over three hours long, but I was amazed that it goes by so quickly. I don't think it is overrated at all, I think the IMDb rating is perfectly decent. The film looks sumptuous, with gorgeous costumes and excellent effects, and the direction from James Cameron rarely slips from focus. Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances as Jack, and Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose. David Warner, a great actor, steals every scene he's in. The story is very rich in detail, and is hot on character development, obvious with the love story which is very moving when it needs to be, though in the first bit of the movie it is a little slow. The last hour is extremely riveting, and I will confess that I was on the edge of my seat, when the Titanic sank. I will also say that the last five minutes were very moving. The music score by James Horner was lovely, though I never was a huge fan of the song My Heart will Go On. The 1996 miniseries was good, but suffered from undeveloped scenarios and some historical inaccuracies. Overall, I give Titanic an 8.5/10. Bethany Cox.",Titanic
2,bkoganbing,Maytime On The High Seas,10,2 September 2007,"Who says that old fashioned romantic films don't sell. They certainly do if they're done right as the story in Titanic certainly is.This blockbuster version of the most famous shipwreck in history is a homage to Maytime. In fact in casting Gloria Stuart as old Rose through whose eyes we see the disaster unfold, Director James Cameron went back to a contemporary of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy.The film begins with the discovery of the wreck of the Titanic in the middle Eighties which did cause great excitement at the time. Searching the wreck divers come upon a safe and a nude portrait of a woman wearing a necklace with a diamond thought to be lost and the portrait is dated April 14, 1912. The woman is still alive and its Gloria Stuart who tells her tale the way an aged Jeanette MacDonald did in Maytime.Winning a card game that got him a third class passage aboard the maiden voyage of Titanic, itinerant artist Leonardo DiCaprio gets on board the vessel. He meets and woos a younger version of Gloria Stuart who is played by Kate Winslet. Unfortunately she's about to enter a loveless marriage for money urged on by her mother, Frances Fisher, who wants her declining years not be spent in the poorhouse. Her prospective fiancé is Billy Zane a rather arrogant young robber baron heir of his time who has a factotum/bodyguard in David Warner who has one of the best roles in the film. Still Leo and Kate get a few stolen hours of romance before the disaster strikes.One thing that James Cameron did is that he never allowed the spectacle of the disaster nor even the issues of wealth and class that were omnipresent in the Titanic story to overwhelm his romantic leads. In fact they are an integral part of the story as young Leo reaches for what was unobtainable.Leonardo DiCaprio remarked that his part of Jack was the least complex role he ever did. The part is a romantic lead, the guy has no secrets or hidden issues, he's just a young man in love. Maybe that was the reason he was not nominated for Best Actor in the face of all those nominations Titanic did get. It won for Best Picture and Best Director and a flock of Oscars in the technical area. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart were nominated and lost for Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress respectively.Titanic is a story that's been filmed since the silent days almost in the wake of the disaster itself. The Germans made a propaganda film of it in 1943 which Nazi inspired though it was, did make a few points against the British upper classes and that the first class got saved and those in steerage mostly drowned. There was a fine version in 1953 with Clifton Webb and Barbara Stanwyck as an older married couple with problems on the doomed ship. And the British did the classic, A Night to Remember which is a documentary like recreation from the ship's officers point of view.Still they'll have to go some beat this one. Titanic is a film for lovers of all ages and run Maytime back to back with Titanic if you can get DVDs and/or VHSs of both films.",Titanic
3,Leofwine_draca,Overblown,5,30 June 2015,"You know, I love disaster movies, and you don't get much bigger a disaster flick than TITANIC, James Cameron's magnum opus, a massively-budgeted and massively award-winning 1997 film that swept the board at the Oscars and has gone down in history as one of the most popular films ever made. Yet I only enjoyed half of it, and that's due to a problematic structure that sacrifices disaster in favour of a cheesy, sappy romance story.Cameron has always been king when it comes to technology and people interacting with it: from his early sci-fi movies to THE ABYSS and AVATAR, he's great at depicting a world where people interact with technology and use it to their advantage. When he focuses on the disaster and sinking of the ship, this is an excellent film with some very impressive special effects that really get across the scale of the disaster.When it comes to human characters, Cameron is a much less assured writer. The romance that plays out here is more unrealistic than in a cheap paperback novel and just as twee. The characters are one-dimensional, from DiCaprio's irritating commoner to Winslet's utterly unbelievable aristocrat who falls in love with him. Their romantic scenes are cringeworthy and as with the other characters they act in very modern days that would have been alien to the era. The less said about the likes of Billy Zane's cardboard cut-out villain the better.In the end, we get a film which spends the entire first hour and a half just plodding around with dumb characters before the disaster strikes, and then things pick up, although there are still lots of cheesy moments and poor dialogue. It's 2/3 romance and 1/3 disaster, and while the disaster stuff is great, the romance is execrable. A NIGHT TO REMEMBER remains the best retelling of the tragedy out there because it focused on the events of the tragedy; I feel Cameron's TITANIC does a disservice to those who lost their lives that night.",Titanic
4,SnoopyStyle,"Come for the CGI and the love story, Stay for the sinking",9,15 December 2013,"Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) is searching for a legendary gem called The Heart of the Ocean presumed lost on the Titanic. When he finds a drawing instead, Rose (Gloria Stuart/Kate Winslet) comes on board and tells her story of Titanic and her love Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). She's a wealthy girl destined for a loveless marriage to the hateful Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). He's a wandering artist who won his Titanic ticket in a poker game. He would save her in every way that a person can be saved.I have often railed against the insertion of a love story unnecessarily into a historical event like 'Pearl Harbor'. But I think James Cameron made the right decision here. The story is compelling by itself. Leo has that boyish charm. Kate and Leo has become a legendary Hollywood big screen pairing. This time it works because it's well written, and well acted.There is the great CGI. It's relatively seamless, and ahead of its times. The engine room is magnificent, even better than the boat itself. The iceberg hit was very convincing.Then there is the sinking. For something that is absolutely expected, it still shocks. The suspense of it all holds my attention every time. The last hour of the movie is perhaps one of the most tension filled sequence of all times. It is the incredible CGI as well as the amazing stunts. It marries the real world with the computer world, and have rarely been exceeded even to this day. It is more harrowing than all those 3D superheroes smashing into skyscrapers. For it's iconic status, I have to give this 9/10.",Titanic
5,Hitchcoc,It's About People,9,28 March 2006,"It's hard to believe that nearly nine years have passed since this movie came out. It's a masterpiece of special effects and storytelling, even if the romance schmaltzes it up a bit. I'm not too critical about films that stretch the truth. If that were not the case, we would only watch documentaries, and, of course, many of those are suspect. In addition to the incredible recreation of the Titanic and the people who sailed her, there is an air of mystery maintained throughout, accentuated by the incredible music score. The fact that we all know the story and the result makes us voyeurs to history. I enjoyed this movie, and yet it made me sad. I sat next to a couple of twenty something types with their baseball caps on backwards, yelling ""all right"" when a falling body would smack against an obstruction as it plummeted down the length of the capsizing ship. I sat in awe of the power of nature and imagined those poor people dying from the stupidity of an overconfident shipbuilder and captain. I know it's just a movie, but it had a really connection to my heart. The business with Leonardo de Caprio and Kate Winslet didn't really grab me. What did was that there was a hopelessness beyond anything we can fathom. If you read my review of ""A Night to Remember,"" also a fine film from much earlier, you will see that it's about people saying goodbye to their wives and children and to another day that makes this event so horrible. It's quite a marvelous movie. We may have forgotten that in the wake of all the attention it received, including parodies and spoofs.",Titanic
6,mark.waltz,"One of many movies and many stories from the ship of dreams, but still floats at the top of the list.",10,30 June 2020,"From ""Cavalcade"" in 1933 to ""Titanic"" in 1953, ""A Night to Remember"" in 1957 and ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" in 1964, the doom ship Titanic became a voyage of legendary, if tragic, proportions, and in the time leading up to its 85th year spawned a TV movie, a Broadway musical and this masterpiece which had audiences preparing to get tickets for it even before it was finished shooting. The reason is clear: James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio, the promise of effects like you'd never seen in any movie, and a Celine Dion song sung over the teaser trailer that would shoot her to super-stardom.This is told in flashback through the experiences of the 102 year old survivor Rose Calvert (veteran 1930's movie actress Gloria Stuart, nearly forgotten until cast in this), shocked to see a drawing of herself in pristine condition. The nude drawing of her as a young woman wearing a valuable diamond is found in a safe pulled from the ancient wreckage and she immediately notifies the explorers who are searching for more Titanic artifacts and stories. Arriving with pretty much every single belonging of hers as well as her doting granddaughter, Stuart winces in tears with a sudden memory, but insists on going on with her story.From there, we are swept back decades to the luxurious ship on its maiden and only voyage, and the huge vessel is grandly detailed and scaled as only an epic of this nature can scale it to be. Winslet is engaged to the vain Billy Zane, forced by her desperate mother (Frances Fisher) to tolerate him because they are broke and only have their ""name"" to benefit them. Fisher, obviously having married ""up"" , is ultra snobby to the neuvo riche Kathy Bates, and when she meets Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), she knows trouble lies ahead, and her demeanor is enough iceberg for any young lady. Dawson has saved young Roe from committing suicide in the icy waters below, and their first encounter turns into a love that you know can only end tragically.With real life Titanic passengers Brown, John Jacob Astor and his wife Madeline (which would be a great subject for a separate movie), Benjamin Guggenheim and Isadore and Ida Strauss (another subject that would be a touching film), this mixes in these real life characters with the fictional ones. Zane and his humorless right hand man (David Warner) are great villains, with Zane absolutely vile as he psychotically tries to maintain his stolen dignity when he loses his trophy wife to be to a commoner. Watching Zane go psychotic as he stoops to the depths of evil makes you wish he wouldn't make it off, but the writers have an even better plan for him.The film takes well over 90 minutes before the disaster sequences start, and from then on, it is a dizzying, sometimes headache inducing bit of tense moments as DiCaprio, locked to a metal pole to drowned for daring to love Winslet, struggles to be set free. It goes on a bit too long, but for first time viewers is truly frightening. There were buckets of tears being flowed at the Paramount Studios theater I saw this in prior to the release, and even after half a dozen or so viewings, it can still bring them on.Certainly this is filled with cliches, but they are the type of cliches that have worked since the days of the silent movies. This was probably the first film since ""Gone With the Wind"" to be considered a guaranteed Oscar winner, sweeping a good majority of them when it came out. In many ways,, this has very old fashioned ideals and is thus an old fashioned style movie, one of the last of its kind that still worked (""The Artist"" from 20 years later was a rare exception.) I can watch this once a year and still be emotionally turned to mush by it. That is what makes an instant classic.",Titanic
7,classicsoncall,"""The ship will sink"".",9,18 August 2011,"Imagine being the Captain of The Titanic and told by it's architect that it will sink with absolute mathematical certainty. Immediate denial sets in but the instincts are too strong. The most incredible machine ever built by human hands will lie on the bottom of the ocean floor in a matter of hours, and there's nothing anyone can do about it. The sheer horror of it reels the imagination.It took me a long time to get past the hype of the film's original release. Sometimes it's better to let all that hoopla pass and see a picture on it's own merits rather than on the recommendation of anyone and everyone. While watching, I tended to key in on the historical elements of the voyage rather than the love story. Realizing that most films like this rely on a romance to move the picture along, I'm willing enough to go along with it. To go too far in the other direction would move it toward a documentary, and there are enough of those around if that's what you're after.I was fairly impressed with the technical aspects of the picture regarding the disaster. Following Ismay's (Jonathan Hyde) analysis of how the Titanic would take on water and sink, and actually seeing it play out made for some dramatic special effects. What's almost impossible to comprehend is how the passengers on board ship might have actually reacted on that fateful night. The calamity of it is absolutely mind boggling and difficult to contemplate.I give director Cameron and the special effects folks all the credit there is for producing an epic disaster film. DiCaprio and Winslet perform capably, though I wasn't necessarily wowed by their portrayals. Even if your only motivation to see the picture is it's inclusion as one of the top grossing pictures of all time, you shouldn't be disappointed.",Titanic
8,gavin6942,An Odd Film in the James Cameron Canon,7,11 May 2015,"A seventeen-year-old aristocrat (Kate Winslet), expecting to be married to a rich claimant (Billy Zane) by her mother, falls in love with a kind but poor artist (Leonardo DiCaprio) aboard the luxurious, ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic.The first thing that is really striking about this film is that it came from James Cameron, who is much better known for science fiction films like ""Terminator"", ""Avatar"" and ""Aliens"". He is not the first person that comes to mind when you think of historical fiction romances. And yet, he nailed it. ""Titanic"", despite its length of three hours, was a huge success and may have sold more VHS copies than any other movie.But beyond the romance, this is actually a rather decent movie. I cannot say why, it is something hard to put one's finger on. Most likely, it has something to do with Billy Zane, who is more or less the greatest thing about the film.",Titanic
9,lee_eisenberg,"In Spanish class, I wrote a story portraying the famous movies of 1997 aboard the Titanic while it was sinking.",5,19 October 2005,"Okay, everyone knows what happens in ""Titanic"", so I'll discuss a few other points. While the movie was in the theaters, one of my friends went to see it 13 times, just so that he could find goofs; the one that he picked up on was when someone opens a door, turns his head, and you see that it's the wrong color. When I took a sailing class in summer, 2005, the teacher explained why specifically the Titanic sank: it was traveling way too fast for something that size (so they couldn't turn in time), and the metal on the ship's sides was rather shoddy; that is to say, they endangered everyone's lives so as to save money for themselves (well, that's one of many times when those at the top have put profits ahead of safety). And I have a question: considering how many people died on the Titanic, was it appropriate to use this event to further Leonardo DiCaprio's career? As for that story that I wrote, it portrayed Kevin Kline and Tom Selleck (from ""In & Out"") believing themselves to resemble Leo and Kate; Al Pacino (from ""Donnie Brasco) realizing that he was going to sleep with the fishes; Jim Carrey (from ""Liar Liar"") admitting: ""I can't lie: I wasn't watching for icebergs while I was steering!""; Kim Basinger (from ""LA Confidential"") wondering whether or not she would look like Veronica Lake at the bottom of the ocean; and Jack Nicholson (from ""As Good as It Gets"") still inside his cabin and saying ""Don't knock on my door! Even if the ship is sinking, don't knock on my door!"".Oh, I forgot to say my opinion of the movie. When everyone at school asked me what I thought, I always said ""Well, I..."" That's what I'm going to say here. I consider ""Titanic"" right down the middle. I think that ""In & Out"" was the best movie of 1997. End of story.",Titanic
10,jboothmillard,Titanic,9,13 June 2005,"This is one of the greatest romance drama and disaster movies ever made, and also the most expensive movies (costing around $200m) from Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning director James Cameron (Terminators 1 + 2, Aliens). This is the nearly completely accurate depiction of the 1912 disaster of the ""unsinkable"" Southampton launched cruise liner Titanic. One of the biggest ships ever made Titanic is heading to New York. Jack Dawson (Golden Globe nominated Leonardo DiCaprio) is the lucky tramp who won tickets with his friend to go onto Titanic. While touring the boat and meeting new friends he sees engaged Rose Dewitt Bukater (the gorgeous Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Kate Winslet). Jack and Rose form a very close friendship, which obviously becomes more. Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) is the nasty guy who is wanting to marry Rose. Unfortunately, Jack and Rose are soon threatened along with 2,200 people from the iceberg causing the sinking of the ship, what steals the show. Very teary towards the end and a beautiful story of courage and passion. Also starring Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Gloria Stuart as Rose Dawson Calvert, Bill Paxton as Brock Lovett, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy, Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews, Jonathan Hyde as Bruce Ismay and Ioan Gruffudd as 5th Officer Lowe. 11 Oscars were won, equalling Ben-Hur and The Lord of the Rings. It won the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects, Best Film Editing, Best Music for James Horner, Best Song for Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" (also won the Golden Globe, and number 14 on 100 Years, 100 Songs), Best Sound and Best Picture, and it was nominated for Best Makeup, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for James Horner, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Sound, Best Special Effects, the David Lean Award for Direction and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globes for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Original Score, and it was nominated for Best Screenplay. Leonardo DiCaprio was number 94, and Kate Winslet number 55 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Winslet was also number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, the film was number 100 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""I'm king of the world""), it was number 25 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 3 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers, it was number 37 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, it was number 8 on The Ultimate Film, and it was number 54 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",Titanic
11,ccthemovieman-1,Lies & Annoying Romance Ruined Story,5,30 August 2006,"No sense going into great detail about this film, which just about everyone who watches movies saw when it came out. I still don't recall a film getting as much ""hype"" as this one did. I doubt if the Second Coming would get the kind of publicity this movie received. It was disgusting - the PR, the story and the favorable box office response.Oh, once the ocean-liner hits the icebergs and the disaster starts, it's terrific but that's not until the last 45 minutes of this 194-minute movie. Too bad we had to wade through all the baloney before this climactic scene.The baloney, in a nutshell, was (1) a stupid teen romance between two arrogant, unlikeable people; (2) most the film being a lie, defaming many of the people who were heroes in that disaster, instead choosing to picture them as selfish villains.The latter is all in the name of 'political correctness,' some filmmakers like James Cameron, are filled with, something akin to horse manure.To make it brief: in real life, the men in the First Class did everything they could to get the women and children safely off the boat. Just look it up! Relatives of those people were justifiably extremely upset over Cameron's totally-fabricated story, and I can't blame them.Anyway, even with all the untruths, if they had cut down on the Leonardo DiCaprio-Kate Winslet rebel-type attitude and romance, it would have been a far better film, but then again you wouldn't have the billions of dollars in revenue from the 12-15-year-old girls who flocked by the millions to see this farce. The rest of us would have preferred to see the true story of the famous disaster.",Titanic
12,rmax304823,Expensive wreck.,5,20 November 2005,"I've always enjoyed the British version, ""A Night to Remember,"" based on Walter Lord's popular book. Yes, it's black and white, and a bit dated, but it's a straightforward telling of an awesome disaster.The 1953 Hollywood version was a boring soap opera which was set aboard the Titanic simply so that some exciting and dramatic scenes could be tacked on at the end.This one is more like the Hollywood version, only with a budget extended to the power of n. What a wreck! In some shots the ship doesn't seem the size of a man-made artifact at all. It seems impossibly huge, twenty leagues long. When the stern rises into the air and a figure falls from the fantail, the figure dwindles down toward the sea which seems a million miles away, and vanishes except for a minuscule white spot marking its splash point. The Titanic in this movie is colossal, stupendous, magnificent, gargantuan, or -- in a word -- titanic.Before the f/x-resplendent climax we endure a romance between a lower-class handsome young man and a pretty, rich young lady. Now, few people realize this, but this is the first cinematic exploration of the theme of True Love overcoming Class Distinctions. Yes, it's true. Love conquers all and you can be sure that threepence or so will be no more than grist for its mill.The film's full of stereotypical character and they're not worth going into. Well, one example -- the wealthy coward who tries to buy his way into a lifeboat. More examples. (There are so many.) Here are the two lovers clinging to the flagstaff as they plung into the see. ""This is where we first met!"", she says breathlessly. Earlier the couple find a brand new automobile in the cargo. He leaps into the driver's seat and beeps the ancient horn gaily, as in a Walt Disney movie. She sits elegantly in the coach. ""Where to?"" he asks. ""Take me to the stars!,"" she chirps. There's a subplot involving a stolen jewel, straight out of Basil Rathbone's Sherlock Holmes movies. Basically this is a megabuck special effects extravaganza built around a B-movie script.So much is lost. Like the irony of the California, sitting a few miles away, watching and misinterpreting the Titanic's distress rockets. The piling up of personal telegrams that kept the radio officer too busy to tend to the ice warnings.The Titanic disaster was an interesting lesson in sociology though, factually speaking. Women and children only, right? Very gentlemanly. Very Edwardian.And most of the women in first class passage were in fact saved. A far lesser proportion of women and kids in second class were saved, and only a handful from third class. You can actually MEASURE the relative impact of social class, gender, and age.I don't want to make this film sound like the catastrophe that the Titanic's first voyage was. If you liked, say, ""Pearl Harbor,"" you'll probably like this. It has pretty much the same structure.There's something else that occurred to me while watching this though. When should we just leave the real Titanic alone? Some years ago, Telly Savalas was featured in a TV program called something like, ""Treasures from the Titanic,"" in which he displayed and described items retrieved from the wreck and the surrounding sea floor. Savalas gave his best imitation of a carnival barker. You know, smiling, holding up a boot for the camera, pronouncing, ""This was somebody's shoe. Imagine. Someone wearing this shoe as the stately liner made its final descent."" The disarticulated carcass of the Titanic is a giant necropolis, filled with human remains and, who knows?, benthic ghosts. It's a burial ground of sorts. Should we really go searching among the bodies for watches and gold teeth?",Titanic
13,BA_Harrison,"To be fair, when Jack tried to get on the door, it tipped up.",9,15 January 2020,"A big boat hits a huge lump of ice and slowly sinks. Meanwhile, a chirpy American lad, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), gets it on with Rose (Kate Winslet), a posh bit of British totty, much to the annoyance of the girl's fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane, putting in a wonderfully loathsome performance).James Cameron's Titanic is what I call 'factasy'. In other words, it's a factual story combined with fantastical elements to make the finished article more entertaining to the masses. A more recent example of this melding of truth and fiction is The Aeronauts, but where that film played it too fast and loose with the facts and ultimately came crashing down to earth in tatters, Cameron gets the balance of real and imagined just right, making his film both a fascinating insight into one of the most famous disasters of the 20th century, and a thoroughly charming love story.A master storyteller, Cameron successfully steers his way around any potentially disastrous obstacles that threaten to bring the film to a standstill. Even though there's a good hour and a half before any sight of an iceberg, Titanic is thoroughly engrossing from start to finish, a testament to its director's skill at weaving a good yarn, and to the talent of his impressive cast (which includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown and David Warner as Spicer Lovejoy). Kate and Leo make for one of cinema's most iconic pair of lovers, and exude a likability and charm that carries the first half of the film. The latter part is mostly about the special effects, something that Cameron excels at, always pushing the boundaries of technology. Even after 23 years, the sinking of the mighty ship is a sight to behold, and still sends chills up the spine.It's only the film's closing moments that prevent me from giving the film full marks: why oh why did Old Rose (Gloria Stuart) chuck her priceless necklace into the sea? Give it to your granddaughter, donate it to an orphanage, put it in a museum, let Bill Paxton have it, but please don't throw it overboard! And as if that crazy act wasn't reprehensible enough, when the old dear carks it, her spirit returns to the Titanic to be reunited with Jack -- excuse me Rose, but what about your dead husband and father to your child?9/10.",Titanic
14,moonspinner55,"A technical marvel, it also manages to be emotionally charged and involving",8,29 December 2002,"I half-expected an overwrought concoction of incredible high drama, but James Cameron's fictionalized film of a real incident from 1912 is nearly free of derivative devices or sappy puppy love issues. Before the infamous ocean liner perishes in the icy Atlantic Ocean, two passengers--third-class gadabout Leonardo DiCaprio and conflicted first-class passenger Kate Winslet--fall in love in what is a very captivating romantic interlude. Cannily-made picture is, of course, full of marvelous effects, but its this key romance that most people will end up remembering (and with good reason, as the performers are terrific). Cameron's pacing is both giddy and tight, and he draws vivid characterizations from the supporting players as well. High entertainment. ***1/2 from ****",Titanic
15,dbdumonteil,my heart will go on...,10,29 March 2003,"One of the monuments of the cinema which won 11 Oscars in Hollywood in 1998, a huge success (well deserved) all over the world. The revelation of two actors until then virtually unknown. This is James Cameron' masterpiece. He chose to relate the tragedy of the Titanic that took place on the 12th of April 1912, through the intermediary of a love story lived between a wealthy and pretty young woman (Kate Winslet) and a modest painter (Léonardo Dicaprio). Cameron succeeds in making it fascinating in the first part of the movie. The love between ""Jack"" and ""Rose"" is so strong that can hardly believe the Titanic will bump into an iceberg and will sink. It's also together with a model bravery that the two lovers will try to escape the ship's sinking (although historically accurate).Léonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet will stay among the famous mythical couples in the cinema's history. It's obvious that they are between the hands of a conscientious and carefully organized film-maker. James Cameron doesn't leave anything high and dry. He adopted a sustained rhythm not spoiled by the enormous means that he's got. It's useless to say that he masters them perfectly thanks to an important budget. Not only has this budget enabled a meticulous reconstruction of the ship but it has also enabled a reconstruction from the traditional life in 1912 with its contrasts, its oppositions. Moreover, the movie enjoys an outstanding performance from all the actors, even the minor ones and several sequences and dialogs don't lack humor.But ""Titanic"" is also a limited place where takes place the confrontation of two different worlds: the proletarians and the middle-class persons. This confrontation is particularly well described during the ship's sinking: the rich are by the lifeboats whereas the poor are still inside the ship and they're forbidden to go outside.The second part of the movie is remarkably well filmed and follows a logical advance based on the increase of fear and distress. Cameron emphasizes particularly on the madness that spread to the passengers but also on the officers. Little by little, these last ones are becoming mad (one of them will kill unwittingly one of the passengers who was trying to get into a lifeboat). Besides, a few touches make the movie surrealist (the four musicians keep on playing while the ship's sinking)The other obvious qualities: a gorgeous music, some smart costumes. At the end, a movie that creates a deep emotion and where everything contributes to a perfect success.",Titanic
16,blanche-2,Breathtaking recreation of the tragic voyage,10,5 September 2010,"Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are young lovers on the doomed ""Titanic"" in this 1997 film directed, written, and edited by James Cameron. The film also stars Billy Zane, Gloria Stuart, Kathy Bates, Francis Fisher, and Victor Garber.Rather than go into the story, I'll just say that this film is a true masterpiece, meticulously researched, designed, costumed, and acted, and gives one the feeling of the desperation, fear, sorrow, and finality that the people on the ship must have felt. The entire time I watched it, I kept thinking of the people on the planes and in the World Trade Center on 9/11.There have been several films about the Titanic but none so lovingly recreated and so powerful emotionally. Kate Winslet is exquisite as Rose, the upper class young woman engaged to a brute (Zane), who falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). DiCaprio is terrific - exuberant, passionate, and adventurous.If you don't know a lot about the Titanic, this movie will pique your interest. When you read more about it, you'll be impressed by Cameron's commitment to bring this piece of history to life.",Titanic
17,Quinoa1984,"Well Done, yet over rated",7,22 March 2000,"James Francis Cameron's Titanic is a well done film, but I think it gets more credit than it deserves.  True, the film won eleven Academy awards (including 3 for Cameron and 2 for composer James Horner), but I think it shouldn't had been ranked so high- like with Ben-Hur status.If you don't know the story of Titanic now, your probably one of the ones who didn't survive because the story is world-renoun.  So are it's actors (Leonardo DiCaprio is not at his best, Kate Winslet is at least hot, and Billy Zane works as a villain) who work into Jim Cameron's script about romance on the high seas.  Luckily, the film doesn't go as slow as you may think, but still, that's no excuse to have the Titanic sinking in the movie longer than it did in  real life.But seriously, this film does have many great qualitites.  The story is well lay out, and the special effects are dazzling (it actually looks like the Titanic is sinking) which also won a Oscar.  One of the great points in this film is the score by James Horner which is his best and one of the best ever, but that is over-shadowed by fancy fireworks and bad acting.  Good direction though.

18,tavm,James Cameron's Titanic is still entertaining with 3-D adding a little to the experience,9,29 April 2012,"Well, 15 years after first seeing this at a second run-dollar theatre that I worked at when I was living in Jacksonville, FL, I finally decided to watch Titanic again in 3-D at the place my movie cinema-working friend is now employed at. Once again, we experienced the romance between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the latter wants to escape the more controlling Billy Zane. Despite the dialogue between them verging on the melodramatic, director James Cameron also thought up some truly witty lines that especially suited Kathy Bates as the Unsinkable Molly Brown. And, yes, it's still very touching seeing Jack and Rose willing to stay together during all that chaos as the title ship keeps sinking. And how cool is it seeing Golden Age veteran Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose recounting how it was during Titanic's only voyage. And not to mention James Horner's iconic score. And while I thought Celine Dion's Oscar-winning song ""My Heart Will Go On"" was overplayed on Top 40 radio stations then, I actually enjoyed hearing it again during the end credits (though we only stayed through the cast list). And of course, Cameron keeps things exciting enough during the climatic sinking though sometimes I thought he piled it a bit much when he showed a young boy crying just standing there as Jack and Rose were running (it felt a little more contrived than usual though I realized such a scene could have really taken place). In summation, James Cameron's Titanic is still a very entertaining picture worthy of its Oscar status enhanced a bit by the 3-D experience though it wasn't really necessary IMHO.",Titanic

Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet shine as our doomed hero and heroine. In a comeback performance, Gloria Stuart does very well in the part of Winslet as an old woman.What is so enjoyable about this film is the sociological depiction of the upper and lower classes. We can see from almost the beginning of the disaster, the lower class will be doomed to tragedy.Frances Fisher gives excellent support as Kate's upper class mean mother. This is a mother so mean that Kate went through life never revealing to her that she had survived.Di Caprio, it has been argued, looked too young for the part. He really seemed to mature as the film went on. His scene before his demise was well done and memorable.",Titanic
20,sunwarrior13,There Is Nothing To Dislike In Titanic,10,29 October 2011,"If there is one film that has the complete package and that could probably be appreciated by people from all walks of life,the 1997 movie,Titanic is it.No wonder it remains the highest-grossing film of all-time.Titanic is an epic film written and directed as well as co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron.It stars Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson, Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater and Billy Zane as Rose's fiancé,Cal Hockley.It also features Frances Fisher,Bill Paxton,Kathy Bates,Danny Nucci,Bernard Hill,Victor Garber and Gloria Stuart as the 100 year-old Rose.It is a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic wherein its passengers,Jack and Rose are members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.Writer-director James Cameron employed state-of-the-art digital special effects for this production and realized it on a monumental scale that made the movie the most expensive to produce and the most successful box office hit to date.The story of Titanic involves American treasure-seeker Brock Lovett retrieving artifacts from the submerged ship. Lovett looks for diamonds but finds a drawing of a young woman, nude except for a necklace. When 100-year-old Rose reveals she's the person in the portrait, she is summoned to the wreckage site to tell her story of the 56-carat diamond necklace and her experiences of many years earlier. The scene then shifts to 1912 Southampton where passengers boarding the Titanic include penniless Jack Dawson and society girl Rose DeWitt Bukater, returning to Philadelphia with her wealthy fiancé Cal Hockley. After the April 10th launch, Rose develops a passionate interest in Jack, and Cal's reaction is vengeful. At midpoint in the film, the Titanic slides against the iceberg and water rushes into the front compartments. Even engulfed, Cal continues to pursue Jack and Rose as the massive liner begins its descent. After her story is complete,Rose goes alone to the stern of Lovett's ship and drops her jewelry known as Heart Of The Ocean into the sea.The movie remains the greatest and most spectacular demonstration of what modern technology can contribute to dramatic storytelling.Aside from that,it is an extraordinary achievement in film making wherein technology astounds but better yet the human story shines even brighter.Credit the performances of the talented cast especially DiCaprio,Winslet and Stuart.The story also touches all themes that possesses a winning combination of a tale that both modern and old- fashioned. Added to that,credit also goes to James Horner for the film for it was full of beauty and magical.""My Heart Will Go On"",the movie's love theme that was composed by Horner and sung by Celine Dion,will always be memorable and treasured by viewers for many years to come. Overall,there is nothing to dislike in Titanic for it is a winner not only in every aspect of film making attested by the 11 Academy Awards it has won but for the taste of viewers all over the world alike.",Titanic

22,hitchcockthelegend,Beautiful Romance - Tragedy Unbound.,9,18 June 2013,"It has kind of become the popular thing to kick Titanic, the film and its achievements. It's like the love it garnered on release and the colossal waves it made in the history of cinema, never happened, or as some want you to believe, doesn't matter. I can tell you now that many of my macho fuelled friends will privately, under the influence of liquid refreshments, admit to having affection for the film, but socially in a circle environment? Not a bit of it! I have no such problems admitting my love for the film, I love it as much now as I approach 50, as I did when I sat there in awe at the cinema in 1997.You jump - I jump.Titanic is far from flawless, where even now with the advancements in technology the effects over 15 years later look a touch creaky. While it's true as well that away from Rose and Jack the characterisations are thin on the ground. But this is Rose and Jack's story, fully fleshed out for an hour and half and then framed by the terrible tragedy that unfolds for the next hour and half. The tie-in to the present day is superbly constructed by James Cameron - the search for the diamond - the real life filming of the Titanic wreckage - and the flashback telling of the story by a delightful Gloria Stuart as old Rose, and the sinking of the ship and its aftermath is stunning and heart breaking in equal measure.Never let go.So may scenes and dialogue exchanges stay in the memory for ever. The band playing on, the captain awaiting his fate, the mother ushering her children to sleep before the sea comes to take them, the old boy drinking his brandy as the water rushes in, or just Jack and Rose, polar opposites in society's class structure, making love, making art or just professing that neither will ever let go. It's what makes Titanic the wonderful piece of cinema it is, where beauty and tragedy merge to create something forever memorable. A film that deserved all the accolades and cash till ringing that it once did have. 9/10",Titanic
23,Theo Robertson,A Film So Bad It's Obscene,4,28 March 2002,"TITANIC is actually two films. The first film is a very unlikely love story so syrupy it can cause diabetes. Then it suddenly mutates into a James Bond film where - wait for this - Bond is played by Kate Winslet. Maybe this isn't entirely accurate because James is total fantasy , but never becomes as unbelievable as this. Oh and at least in a Bond film the Brits are the good guys unlike here where they are invaribly cruel , stupid and/or cowardly. Also at no point in a Bond film does a script change the laws of physics where it's possible for someone to escape from the undercurrants of a ship weighing thousands of tons. Oh and the special effects are better in Bond films , TITANIC's are not entirely convincing.But the most fantastic thing about TITANIC isn't the fact it made so much money at the box office ( This is explained by 14 year old girls lining up at the cinema to watch Leonardo for the 25th time ) but the fact this film won 11 ( Yes Eleven.You read that right ) Oscars, equalling the total held by BEN HUR. What the hell were the Academy thinking ? I know they didn't give any awards for the quality of the acting or even nominated the screenplay for an Oscar ( They got that right . Boy did they get that right ) but for it to win 11 Oscars including Best Picture ( Didn't any of the voters watch LA CONFIDENTIAL ? ) really upset me because films like GONE WITH THE WIND , etc didn't get that many",Titanic

It is completely counterpointed by the very last scene. An antithesis of the socially conscious concern of the film makers.It is morally reprehensible, irresponsible, incomprehensible, and downright selfish. One wonders how many underprivileged children with empty bellies and deplorable living conditions could have been saved by that mega-million dollar necklace. All for a cheap sentimental tug.Some interesting special effects, attractive people, and unintentional humor are not enough to redeem this unforgivable, utter failure of a film that can only be subjugated to the lower decks of American Cinema.",Titanic

Plot is basic - love story set against the Titanic tragedy, that's it. Just basically drifts for 3.25 hours around that central plot. The direction is all about the amazing special effects, another Cameron trademark.On the plus side, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent in the lead roles, and their interaction is spot-on.

26,Boba_Fett1138,"Good, but overrated.",7,25 November 2002,"I saw the movie for the first time when it arrived on video, needless to say that I had very high expectations for this movie because I heard a lot about it. I watched the movie and I remembered my first reaction when I finished watching it, my reaction was: ""This is it?"" Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad movie, not at all. But I was disappointed about it all and it just didn't met my expectations.Everybody knows the true story about the ship the ""Titanic"" and there are many movies/series made about it already. New about this movie is the love story. It's always dangerous to put a love story in a movie because if the love story doesn't work the movie doesn't work. The love story does work for most parts in this movie, except for some scene's in which I just don't buy it.Although the movie is very long it doesn't really ever get boring, which is of course a good thing. The best part of the movie is the sinking and you can see that James Cameron is really one of the best Action directors in the business.The acting isn't great but not bad either. The special effects look good with the exception of a few needless scene's. The movie is also full of visual mistakes (for instance you can clearly see the camera in a scene, which is a HUGE mistake that I noticed on my first viewing) and the characters in my opinion aren't really interesting enough.Although the movie got more credit then it really deserved I can still recommend this movie to everybody.

Beautiful cinematography and acting, such chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet. The costuming and set design are beyond comparison, creating stunning visuals and bringing the story to life. The gravity of the disaster is conveyed beautifully and never ceases to make me weep endlessly. My only faults are that Jack could have definitely fit on that door, and old rose was dead wrong for tossing that necklace in the ocean.",Titanic
28,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Gargantuan,10,13 March 2010,"Yes, for a long time, I did avoid this one. Eventually, I realized that I had to; Cameron is talented enough to make this work. I've now seen every film he's directed, save for Piranha Part II(which I understand was taken away from him), and the man always does a nice job. No, not every single picture of his is excellent... but they're all worth the time(and with hardly any exceptions(and this certainly isn't one), the investment of emotions from the audience, as well), they entertain and he's yet to make the exact same thing twice(Terminator 2 is different from the original in notable areas, such as the tone). I don't blindly love all of them; I maintain that the quality of The Abyss lies mainly in the gorgeous under-water photography. He never phones it in, and he always has something to say, somewhere to go with what he does. I was apprehensive of the idea that this would focus on a small group of people(in particular, the two leads), when this was indeed something that actually did happen, and many were killed. However, when you think about it, it needed to be like that; that's what makes the incident(in this) have the devastating impact that I think we can all admit it does. Yes, the FX are amazing, and the production values offer a new definition of the term ""grandiose"" when applied to that aspect; the reason we ""feel"" it, though, is that we care about the ones we ""know"" to be on the ship. The characters are well-written, thoroughly developed, credible and all have something to do. Rose is a rather strong woman, and without it reaching anachronistic levels, either. She is not ""just a wife"", and she is fleshed out, something that many attempts at female role models neglect to do. The cast is spot-on, everyone is well-chosen. Every single acting performance is flawless. Arguably, this is somewhat black and white in its presentation of them; with that said, they are all convincing and have genuine personality. This is one of the greatest disaster movies, and epic love dramas, in the world of cinema. It is Hollywood and mainstream at its absolute best. Will it please everyone? Perhaps not, and probably not those who refuse to take it on its own terms. It was always clear what approach this took. And also, about hype... ignore it. Yes, you read that right. In this case and in all others, pretend like you can't hear what everyone is making something out to be, and watch what you feel like, as unaffected by popular opinion as you can be. Nothing can survive a viewing by someone who has heard nothing other than positives about it, regardless of its quality. The pacing is marvelous; for a running time of three hours, this is not boring at all. It has fun and humorous moments. Is it sappy? I suppose that's up to the individual to judge; I wouldn't say so. There is a bit of violence and disturbing content, infrequent mild to moderate language, a little sexuality(hinted at) and brief nudity in this. The DVD comes with a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to everyone. 10/10",Titanic
29,neil-476,Still an epic,10,19 April 2012,"14 years ago I took my then 12 year-old daughter to see a three hour plus film, expecting her to get fidgety: she did not. Neither did I. And now, having seen the movie a number of additional times on a smaller screen, I revisit it on a big screen after a 3D revamp.My first viewing of this movie carried preconceptions with it: I was expecting it to retell the disaster, and I was expecting spectacular eye candy. I got both, and I appreciated that Cameron had chosen a fictitious love story as a vehicle for audience identification to bring home the tragedy on a personal level.On re-watching it 14 years later, I realise that what I'm watching is a romance, played out against the background of the Titanic disaster. I also realise a number of other things: for instance, the groundbreaking computerised extras are no longer as convincing as they were, James Horner's music is great, Cameron's direction is excellent and his writing, despite the occasional clunky bit of dialogue, is very skillful. Oh, and while the performances of the principals are very good, there is some very dodgy work from some of the bit part players.Overall, the verdict is that this film deserved its Oscars. And the 3D conversion has been very successfully carried out, and confirms that Cameron is one of a very small number of directors who truly understands 3D.",Titanic
30,evanston_dad,Two Movies for the Price of One -- Too Bad Only One of Them Is Decent,6,16 July 2009,"""Titanic"" is really two movies: one of them is an exciting, James Cameron-style action film, ""The Poseidon Adventure"" with better special effects; the other is a dull as dirt period romance, so simplistic and cliché it seems like something conceived in the mind of a twelve-year-old girl.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet became household names because of their performances in this, and they do invest the film with a great deal of spunk, but they've got absolutely terrible material to work with. Cameron is clearly no writer, but he is a good director of action, so just tune in to this one once the big ship has actually hit the iceberg, and you'll save yourself a lot of time.The supporting cast includes Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Frances Fisher as Winslet's uptight and aristocratic mother, Victor Garber as the skipper..er...captain, and Billy Zane, in an embarrassingly awful role as the movie's villain. The character as written is like something out of a silent movie, and Zane plays him as such -- if he had a mustache, he'd be twirling it. Too bad his performance is completely at odds with the totally contemporary performances of just about everyone else.Cameron reveals an almost fetishistic obsession with recreating the glamour of the famed ocean liner, and the glee with which he then goes about demolishing it and the people on it borders on the disturbing. It's like watching a little boy build an elaborate train set just so he can have the pleasure of blowing it up with firecrackers.Grade: B",Titanic
31,AlsExGal,Ignores the fact that women in 1912 - rich and poor - were pretty much property,7,12 November 2009,"The special effects are great in this film, and the love story is compelling. Even though there is no uncertainty as to how this movie plays out, it is still quite dramatic and interesting. Plus, you have to marvel at a movie that managed to win the Academy Award for best picture and was also a huge box office hit - a distinction shared with few films over the last twenty years.However, there are a few oversimplifications of the social situation of the passengers in the context of the realities of the early 20th century that bug me every time I watch this movie. First off, there is a heavy handed message of rich = bored and unhappy, poor = genuine and full of life. Given that there was absolutely no social safety net anywhere in the world in 1912, there could be nothing more brutal and grinding than being poor in that era, as if there is any such thing as ""easy poverty"" at any point in history, including today.Second, and somewhat accompanying the first sticking point, is the idea that Rose will somehow be free to be something out of a 1969 Virginia Slim's commercial if only she can lose that rich stiff she is engaged to (Billy Zane's character, Cal) and run off with kindred free-spirit Jack. This illusion not only confronts the fact of grinding poverty in early 20th century America, this flies in the face of entrenched sexism enshrined in the law during that time that wasn't even confronted as a problem until the 1960's. Who, in 1912, is going to let Rose put on a pair of jeans and ride side-saddle on Coney Island? Let her learn to pilot a plane? Allow her to pursue her career goals unless they involve teaching school, nursing, or performing (i.e. doing something that involves serving men)? And even learning those skills cost money she did not have. The fact is at that time a woman in America or anywhere else in the world was considered property. She could either be the property of a rich man (evil Cal) or a poor man. The only main character in this movie that seems to be facing facts is Rose's mother who shows genuine terror at the idea of being poor again - and she SHOULD be afraid, VERY afraid.I once had a 3rd sticking point, but it has been nullified over the last ten years. That sticking point was that Billy Zane's character could feel so superior and entitled given that his wealth and stature were accidents of birth, not the fruits of his own enterprise and imagination. I have since come to realize that some of the smuggest most entitled people on earth are those that were born into their circumstances, so I withdraw that objection.This movie did do a service by dispelling the myth that the slogan on the Titanic was ""women and children first"", when it was, in fact, ""first class women and children first"". In reality, if you were a first-class woman, you had a 97% chance of survival, and just about every first class woman that did die chose to stay behind because she did not want to leave her husband. If you were a female steerage passenger you had about a 45% chance of survival. Worse yet, third class children had a 1 in 3 chance of survival, which was the same rate of survival as the first class men. Not one of either the first or second class children died on the Titanic.Thus, I still enjoy the movie immensely, but I think that the false presentation of early 20th century social reality will always bother me a little every time I watch the film.",Titanic
32,ferguson-6,A Mathematical Certainty,8,7 April 2012,"Greetings again from the darkness. Of course I saw this one a couple of times when it was first released in 1997. Having only watched it once since, I was happy to hear it would get a re-release on its 15th anniversary ... even if the marketing hook was the post-production 3D. My thought was with James Cameron working his technical magic, the 3D would be fine, and maybe even add to the spectacle of the sinking ship. After all, he was the mastermind behind Avatar, which with Hugo, are the only two films (in my opinion) that haven't been weakened with 3D technology.Unfortunately, I can't overstate my disappointment in the 3D for Titanic. The colors and lighting are destroyed. When we first see young Rose (Kate Winslet) arrive to board the majestic ocean liner, her lavender hat appears almost gray through the 3D glasses. And later, the crimson Renault, where Rose and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) get to ""know"" each other, appears dull and darkened. Additionally so many face shots are darkened, rather than illuminated by the beautiful fixtures that adorn Titanic. I was so saddened to see such dullness on top of such greatness. Sure, there were a couple of times where the 3D gave a boost to a special effect, but the film is so beautifully made and such a technical marvel, that the impact is minimal to the positive.What I will say is that despite my frustration with the technology, I do hope a new generation is introduced to the film. Personally, I am no fan of the love story between Jack and Rose. However, it is such a delight to see the young, eager versions of Little Leo and Kate as they go about their antics. They were 22 and 21 respectively during filming, and we now know them as mature actors and major movie stars. That wasn't the case when Titanic first premiered.The real genius of this film is two fold: the story-telling and the technical achievement. Gloria Stuart stars as 101 yr old Rose and she is used to perfection in telling the personal story of Titanic. Her love story with Jack allows director Cameron to show off the amazing ship from all angles ... first class, third class, dining rooms and engine rooms. She also allows the viewer to connect with the characters on a personal level. The technical aspect is even more astounding. Sets, models, CGI, and documentary footage are all blended to form a cohesive presentation of one of the most dramatic events of the past 100 years.Here are a few notes of interest regarding the movie and those involved. The movie was number one at the box office for 15 consecutive weeks and grossed more than $1.8 billion ... a record that stood until Cameron's Avatar eclipsed it. Cameron was already an established sci-fi director with Terminator I & II and Aliens, but he almost had the plug pulled by the production company due to cost overruns. Matthew McConaughey was the producer's first choice for Jack, but Cameron held firm for DiCaprio. The elderly couple hugging each other in bed as the ship sinks were based on the Strauss' who owned the Macy's department store chain. And yes, there were Astor's and Guggenheim's onboard when it went down. If you have seen the movie before, pay particular attention to the secondary characters ... the wardrobes and acting are tremendous: Francis Fisher as Rose's mother, Karthy Bates as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown, Billy Zane as the fiancé, David Warner as his henchman, Bernard Hill as the Captain, Victor Garber as the architect, and Jonathan Hyde as the sleazy ship owner. Also catch Suzy Amis in one of her last acting jobs before becoming Mrs. James Cameron ... she plays the granddaughter to ""old"" Rose.This is an historic film version of an historic event and should be seen by all movie lovers. Some of it is a bit hokey, but if you doubt the technical achievement, compare it to A Night to Remember, the 1958 version of the Titanic story.",Titanic
33,anaconda-40658,Romeo and Juliet on a Boat.,5,30 December 2015,"Titanic (1997): Dir: James Cameron / Cast: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton: It became the biggest box office hit at the time indicating an event in history that plays off an interesting premise. A drawing of a woman is discovered within the ruins of the Titanic and after news coverage she appears at one hundred years old to bring reality to the historical tragedy. Director James Cameron showcases exquisite production and art direction at its most seamless and breathtaking just as he did with other big budget hits such as The Terminator and Aliens. Leonardo DiCaprio plays a drifter who steers Kate Winslet away from a potential suicide. She is caught within an arranged engagement where she grows increasingly sick of the lifestyle. They fall in love where he ultimately demonstrates sacrifice while she grows stronger. Predictably her family disapproves of him until they cling to each other during the pointlessly long climax sinking of the ship. DiCaprio and Winslet are basically Romeo and Juliet under different names. Billy Zane is embarrassing as her jealous fiancé who scowls and pursues them with a gun. Kathy Bates makes an appearance as one of the many doomed passengers. Huge achievement for Cameron but the sinking climax is overlong and sometimes corny as bodies hurl to their deaths leaving many hoping they will not sink with it. Score: 5 ½ / 10",Titanic
34,HotToastyRag,A beautiful recreation,3,6 June 2019,"I have a personal reason for disliking the grand epic Titanic that swept eleven Academy Awards, but for the purposes of this review, I'll remain as impartial as possible. It won't do anyone any good to know that watching this film on the big screen as a child resulted in lifelong hydrophobia.From an artistic standpoint, this movie is flawless. The research and replication of the ill-fated RMS Titanic resulted in an identical duplication. Peter Lamont's production design, Michael Ford's set decoration, and Martin Laing and Charles Lee's art direction is breathtaking. If you spend the entire three hours starting at minute details like dishes, wallpaper, and chandeliers, you'll feel like you're really aboard the ship. The beautiful fashions, designed by Deborah Lynn Scott, are authentic looking and gorgeous. Most of the movie is very beautiful to watch, including the famous dissolve from ruin to reconstruction in the beginning.This wasn't the first movie about the Titanic, and this version's storyline isn't very interesting. Kate Winslet stars as a high-class lady travelling with her mother, Frances Fisher, and her fiancé, Billy Zane. She meets a low-class American, Leonardo DiCaprio, who won his passage in a card game, and he shows her how to really live and fall in love. Parts of the story are rather weak and feel like they belong in a Disney movie rather than a dramatic epic, but I'm sure the love story will please young-minded teenagers.The beginning of the film recreates finding the remnants of the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean, and a very old woman, Gloria Stuart, tells her memory of the voyage. There are a few cuts back and forth from Gloria's story to the 1912 timeline, but once the iceberg is hit, the rest of the film is shown in real-time, which is an interesting touch and a great feat accomplished by director James Cameron and his co-editors Conrad Buff and Richard A. Harris. However, during the last portion of the film, there are a few flaws that aren't hard to catch, the most obvious being a lack of foam in the seawater. The literally freezing water doesn't make anyone's teeth chatter until they're submerged, but if enclosed in iceberg-infested waters up to one's thighs, symptoms of the cold would absolutely be seen. In a romantic gesture, Kate Winslet is seen trudging her way through the water in her extremely heavy petticoats, but she wouldn't have been able to move so quickly if her legs were being frozen and the weight of her thick dress material were added to the mix.So, depending on your point of view, you can fall in love with this beautiful splendor, full of iconic moments and a memorable theme and song. You can lose yourself in the historical replications or spend your time searching for flaws, which you'll find. I won't ever watch the movie again, but let me know what you think!Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since there are scary situations that scarred me for life, I wouldn't let my kids watch it.",Titanic
35,AaronCapenBanner,Romance Amidst Disaster,10,11 December 2013,"James Cameron directed this massive blockbuster hit about the ill-fated maiden voyage of the Titanic in April 1912. Among the many passengers is drifter Jack Dawson(played by Leonardo DiCaprio) who meets unhappy heiress-to-be Rose Dewitt(played by Kate Winslet) and fall mutually in love as disaster strikes the ship, resulting in its sinking, and the loss of many lives. An old version of Rose(played by Gloria Stuart) recounts the romance and tragedy to treasure hunters(led by Bill Paxton) who are looking for a fabled jewel aboard the wreck, which Rose does indeed know something about... Hated by some, resented by others, I still love this film, which works magnificently as a tragic love story and as disaster picture, with outstanding F/X that are still realistic. The full extent of the tragedy is not overshadowed by the romance at all, which is put in proper perspective. Some dialogue could have been better, it's true, but compelling drama at its best, leading to an emotionally devastating end.

Nothing to great...I have seen a lot of films since I have seen this one that I like a heck of a lot more, but this was pretty good.

I saw the actors did alright...I won't badger Leo, I don't hold anything against a guy just because lots of gals like him, I just call him a lucky bast#rd and be done with it.  Kate looks pretty good in this flick and does a rather good job as well.  Like I said though the boat sinking is the highlight and one complaint I have is that there wasn't enough character developement of other characters besides Leo's and Kate's...I have posted some theories on why I think it grossed so much on the message board here, because frankly I think it was a fluke it did gross so much, but I am not saying it was a bad flick.",Titanic
37,Wuchakk,All-around excellent accounting of the doomed ship,9,27 November 2014,"The hype surrounding James Cameron's ""Titanic"" when it was released during Christmas, 1997, and early 1998 was so great that it worked against the film in a way. Few films could live up to such ballyhoo. Nevertheless, viewing it apart from the mass hoopla, it shines in all-around greatness.The movie of course details the doomed maiden voyage of the magnificent Titanic from April 10-15, 1912. This is one of the greatest tragedies in human history. There were only enough lifeboats for half of the over 2200 men, women and children aboard. Why? Because the Titanic was so great they thought she was unsinkable. When it was all over only a little over 700 people survived and 1500 people went to their grave in the cold North Atlantic.This is a movie and not a documentary and, as such, includes a fictional drama to hook the viewer. This is where people will either embrace the film or criticize it. As far as I'm concerned, the story of Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet) is excellent. Rose is only 17 years old and is being forced by her fearful mother (Frances Fisher) to marry the pompously rich Cal (Billy Zane). Jack, by contrast, is a dirt poor wandering artist who's free as the wind and brims with life, love, and humble honesty.Rose instinctively feels trapped and would rather die than marry some fake snob, no matter how handsome and wealthy. She's attracted to Jack because he's the antithesis of Cal. By contrast, her mother views Jack as a threat because she thinks that her only hope of retaining the airs of wealth is through marrying her daughter into a rich family. The ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) is another significant personality. She's new enough to ""high society"" to still relate to the ""commoners"" and so goes out of her way to help Jack and his brushes with the stuffy aristocracy. Thrown into the mix is Cal's priceless diamond necklace for Rose and what happens to it.Speaking of which, there's a modern story (1996 anyway) that brackets the main plot. Bill Paxton stars as a treasure hunter obsessed with the necklace, Suzy Amis as Rose's granddaughter and Gloria Stuart as old-aged Rose. Gloria was 85-86 years old during filming and she just shines in the role.The casting and acting is exceptional, particularly the main performers. It's no wonder that DiCaprio and Winslet went on to great success. In addition, the depictions of the vessel and her tragic sinking are magnificent.Yet it's the powerful subtext that inspires most. What good is great wealth without love, virtue, respect and freedom? In her untainted teenage idealism, Rose would rather die than have this. Jack lacks the former but possesses the latter and, therefore, possesses the former as well, even if you can't see it (if you know what I mean). Rose instinctively senses this and therefore throws all caution to the wind. Some criticize that she goes too far by prematurely getting intimate in the vehicle, but – remember – she grew-up with her life-stifling, greedy, fear-mongering mother and so when she finally gets away from her clutches she naturally goes overboard. Have some compassion! As for the fate of the necklace (***SPOILER***), Rose didn't cash-in on the diamond because she didn't want to rely on Cal for money; and she didn't give it to her granddaughter or the treasure-hunter because it wasn't hers to give. Since the insurance company paid out on the policy Cal's dad took out on it, the diamond belonged to the insurance company if found; it was no longer the property of Hockley or his heirs, and it wasn't the property of Rose either, because it was not made over to her by a deed of gift or a bequest. She came into possession of it by mistake and so was obligated by law to turn it over to the rightful owners or, if that was not possible, to legal authorities. More importantly, the necklace was a reminder of her promise to Jack to ""Never let go."" She thus throws it into the ocean because she had fulfilled her promise to live life to the fullest and was now ready let go, particularly since she finally returned to Jack's watery grave (***END SPOILER***).It wouldn't be right to fail to acknowledge the great score by James Horner and the theme song sung by Celine Dion. Great movies are great because their producers take the time & effort to achieve excellence on every level.Needless to say, because the film runs 3 hours and 14 minutes you have to be in the mood for a long movie to fully appreciate ""Titanic.""GRADE: A",Titanic
38,gradyharp,Continues to Impress,10,2 January 2012,"TITANIC, that preposterously beautiful film made in 1997 with a very young Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet, James Cameron's Magnum Opus, continues to impress, especially when viewed yet again on New Year's Day 2012 - a fifteen year old film that remains one of the most impressive cinematic achievements from Hollywood. One of the many reasons it remains resonant is the manner in which the film addresses class systems - the wealthy versus the poor is a hot topic today and the film shows us why - and the extraordinary cinematic recreation of the sinking of that mighty ship.But for many the manner in which Cameron sets the tone of the story, the reminiscence of the elderly Rose unraveling the tale to her granddaughter and crew of ship Keldysh attempting to raise the Titanic now 84 years on the bottom of the ocean and carrying that theme through the course of the film, seems more cogent today than even at movie's release. Gloria Stewart is radiant as the old Rose and her rapt audience includes Bill Paxton, Suzy Amis, Lewis Abernathy, Nicholas Cascone, and Anatoly M. Sagalevitch. From there the opulence of the 'unsinkable' Titanic unfolds and the gradual love affair between Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) and poor artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio), a relationship at risk from the brewings of Rose's mother (Frances Farmer) and Rose's intended (Billly Zane). The cruise lasted from April 10, 1912 to April 15, 1912, but it was a lifetime of commitment between the young lovers.In retrospect the performances by some fine actors who would continue to rise is of note: Ioan Gruffudd, Victor Garber, David Warner, Danny Nucci etc. The film could have used some editing to reduce the length, and the presence of the unsinkable Molly Brown (Kathy Bates in a wasted role) though historically accurate ads very little to the film and even distracts a bit. Still TITANIC is just that - titanic - and no matter how many times we see it, it never fails to impress. Grady Harp",Titanic
39,safenoe,Fabrizio,7,23 February 2021,"I saw Titanic when it was released all those years ago, and all credit to James Cameron for making this movie a mega-blockbuster big time that launched the careers of Leonardo and Kate. Who would have thought? Anyway, it's the death of Fabrizio that really chokes me up, and I can't help watching it repetitiously on YouTube. Also why did Jack have to die?",Titanic
40,zetes,Something amiss...,4,10 March 2001,"I understand why every Dick and Jane on the planet liked this, but why did the critics give it such good reviews? I mean, it is not, contrary to popular opinion, the worst movie ever made (although, yes, it may be the most overhyped, although The Matrix and Star Wars: Episode 1 are huge contenders). It is merely bad. There are very few things to like in this film. Technically, it succeeds to a point. I really did believe that I was watching a real ship sink (well, since the model built by Cameron for the film was just barely a model and more a full-sized ship, it ought to look real!). Some of the CGI was terrible, though. The people falling from the boat were so obviously digitally created that I laughed a bit. The writing is extraordinarily weak. Dialogue is just as bad. Everything that happened in the film, which takes over 3 hours, can easily be related on a cocktail napkin. The worst part about it has to be the acting. Kate Winslet has actually been good, elsewhere, but here she has nothing to work with. DiCaprio is bad. There's no saving him - his career, much like that of a boy band, is going down the toilet as I type (he's starting to gain weight and get greasy like Marlon Brando did - this sort of right is only reserved for actors of Brando's status, so stop it now, Leo!). Billy Zane is awful, too, but it is mostly that his part is so insubstantial.So do you believe in payolas? It's beginning to make me curious that such obviously bad films as Titanic, American Pie, and The Matrix all got rave reviews from critics. All three of the films were abominations. And you may ask, what does it matter if a critic reviews it well? I don't care about their opinion! Not true, my friend. Even if your insecurities tell you that critics are unimportant, you always secretly feel victory when the consensus is for a film you really like. Therefore, there are no guilty feelings after you have enjoyed something like Titanic so much. Instead, you feel for a fading second that, yes, you are part of high culture. You understand art. BLAH! It's all just sinister psychology working its claws over simple minds.And for those of you who absolutely despise this film, I can guess your favorite pictures: Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Fight Club, and, of course, The Matrix. Well, you people should actually begin to learn what REAL film is. Rent A Night to Remember, the best film about the Titanic's sinking. It is not the greatest film ever made, but it is great.",Titanic
41,Mr-Fusion,"With better characters, the romance might actually merit the running time",5,8 September 2017,"Well, it's not ""Avatar"" levels of disappointment, but ""Titanic"" is far from Cameron's best work. Don't get me wrong, there's a great disaster epic here, but you've gotta work for it. The actual iceberg doesn't appear until 100 minutes in. A hundred. That's a lot of forced love story to slog through before real dread starts to build. And the less said about that song, the better.This isn't a bad movie, and it's technically proficient when the effects take center stage. When it's actually about White Star Line's monumental hubris, and the destruction raining down (or washing in) the spectacle lives up to the director's name. But the rest of it . . . 5/10",Titanic
42,JamesHitchcock,Film-Making on the Grand Scale,8,29 July 2005,"It was brave of James Cameron to attempt an undertaking on this scale. Making the world's most expensive movie ever is always to tempt fate; the film which had previously held that distinction, the Kevin Costner vanity project ""Waterworld"", had been a disaster in both financial and artistic terms. Even before ""Titanic"" was finished, rumours were circulating that it would be equally disastrous; the critics began preparing their ""sinking ship"" metaphors in anticipation of its failure.In the event, of course, the critics were confounded; the film was a great success, both at the box office and with the Academy, who awarded it eleven Oscars including best picture and best director. It became the most talked-about film of 1997. Eight years on there have been other films on a similar epic scale and some of the excitement it provoked has died away. Nevertheless, even today it stands out as a fine achievement.""Titanic"" combines two quite different genres, the disaster movie and the ""heritage"" costume drama. The late nineties saw a modest revival of the disaster picture, that quintessentially seventies genre, with ""Twister"" in 1996 and ""Dante's Peak"" and ""Volcano"" the following year. Cameron took the basic formula for such films and applied it to a real historical event, making a film on a grand scale with lavish attention to period detail. The real Titanic sinking had a number of features which fitted the genre; it is something of a convention of disaster movies that the disaster should be caused, or at least exacerbated, by the incompetence or complacency of those in authority, an element emphasised here. Bruce Ismay, the Chairman of the White Star Line, proudly proclaims the ship unsinkable, then causes the disaster by urging the captain to steam at top speed through an ice-field. To make matters worse, the company have neglected to provide sufficient lifeboats for all on board.Cameron also imported into the film some of the conventions of ""heritage cinema"". That genre has often been used to examine the British class system, often in films which feature romances between individuals from different social backgrounds, such as Losey's ""The Go-Between"" or Merchant-Ivory productions like ""Howard's End"". Cameron takes the same concept and uses the film to examine the historical roots of the American class system, of which the ship, with its first, second and third class passengers, is a microcosm. Intertwined with the story of the tragedy is the story of the romance between Rose Dewitt Bukater, daughter of an aristocratic Philadelphia family, and Jack Dawson, a struggling artist from a working-class background.The America that we see is not, as is sometimes said, a classless society, nor even one where class is solely determined by wealth. The Dewitt Bukaters, for all their old-money pretensions, are in financial difficulties, and Rose's late father died heavily in debt. Rose's mother Ruth sees that the only way to maintain the family's social status will be if Rose makes a ""good"" marriage to a wealthy man, and a seemingly ideal candidate has presented himself in the shape of Cal Hockley, the son of a nouveau-riche industrialist. Unfortunately, Cal is an arrogant, selfish snob, and Rose cannot bear the thought of marriage to him. She considers suicide by throwing herself off the ship, but is dissuaded from doing so by Jack, and the two fall in love.Some have criticised the film for concentrating on the romance of Jack and Rose, arguing that this focus is somehow demeaning to a real-life tragedy in which over a thousand people died. This is not a criticism with which I would agree. It would clearly have been impossible to tell the personal stories of all those who died; Cameron's aim was to put the disaster into context and heighten its impact by giving us two characters we can care about and to make their story representative of the stories of all those caught up in the drama, thus heightening the film's emotional impact.The film has a number of weaknesses. The liberties taken with historical accuracy, such as the denigration of the character of William Murdoch (who in real life died bravely), can sometimes seem offensive. The opening scenes and closing, which deal with the attempts of a modern salvage team to recover from the wreck a valuable jewel given by Cal to Rose, were possibly unnecessary and certainly overlong, and could easily have been pruned. The acting is not always very good; I was less than impressed by Leonardo Di Caprio as Jack. (In fairness it must be said that he has greatly improved as an actor since 1997, having given a good performance in ""Catch Me If You Can"" and an excellent one in ""The Aviator""). Kate Winslet as Rose was better, although even she fell short of the brilliance she had shown in ""Heavenly Creatures"".The weaknesses are, however, greatly outweighed by the film's strengths. A special mention must go to James Horner's evocative score and Celine Dion's song ""My Heart Will Go On"". There are a number of good performances in minor roles, from Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, shunned as vulgar by her fellow first-class passengers but more good-hearted than any of them, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, a decent man but without the strength of character to stand up to Ismay's bullying, and Frances Fisher as Ruth, a woman who puts her social status ahead of her daughter's happiness. In the end, however, this is not a film one watches for the acting. I would agree with the reviewer who said that the real star is neither Kate nor Leo but rather the great ship itself, particularly during the spectacular scenes after it hits the iceberg. The success of ""Titanic"" gave Hollywood back the self-confidence to make pictures on a grand scale with daring, energy and imagination, leading to recent epics such as ""Gladiator"" and ""Troy"". 8/10",Titanic
43,Smells_Like_Cheese,Actually it got better for me,10,10 August 2001,"Back in 1997, do I remember that year: Clinton bans cloning research, the unfortunate death of Princess Diana, the Marlins won the world series and a woman gave birth to septuplets. This was also the big year in the release of Titanic, one of the biggest films of all time: a tale about the ship of dreams, about a boy and a girl who fall in love but are torn apart by their social class and at the height of their emotional commitment the ship meets with disaster. I don't think anybody could have expected Titanic to be as HUGE as it was, the movie was bigger than life and had millions of fans, 85% of them being teenage girls, I was 12 years old at the time, and of course saw the movie multiple times. It was the film that made me believe that the love that Jack and Rose shared was so real and beautiful. At the time I felt that Titanic could do no wrong, of course I grew up and didn't watch the film since I was 14, a couple years ago I saw the film on DVD for 5.99 and figured that it was a good price and to see what I thought about the movie now. Was it worth the hype? Was it really the best movie of all time? Was that Leonardo's real nose? OK, I know that's silly to say, but I did re-watch the film. Being completely honest here, Titanic is a great movie, it delivered in romance, humor, disaster, emotions and took us on this incredible maiden voyage.The film starts with Brock Lovett and his team exploring the wreck of the RMS Titanic, searching for a necklace set with a valuable blue diamond called the Heart of the Ocean. Unsuccessful, they instead discover a drawing of a young woman wearing the Heart of the Ocean, dated the day the Titanic sank. 101-year-old Rose Dawson Calvert learns of the drawing, and contacts Lovett to inform him she is the woman in the drawing. When asked if she knew the whereabouts of the necklace, Rose Calvert recalls her memories aboard the Titanic, revealing for the first time that she was Rose DeWitt Bukater. In 1912, the upper-class 17-year-old Rose boards the ship with her controlling fiancé, Cal Hockley and her desperate for money mother, Ruth DeWitt Bukater. Distraught and frustrated by her engagement, Rose attempts suicide by jumping from the stern. Before she leaps, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson intervenes who convinces her not to jump. Jack and Rose strike up a tentative friendship as she thanks him for saving her life, and he shares stories of his adventures traveling and sketching; their bond deepens when they leave a first-class formal dinner of the wealthy for a much livelier gathering of dancing, music and beer in third-class. After revealing their love for each other and wish to leave together when the ship docks, they then witness the ship's fatal collision with an iceberg and now must escape together.So does Titanic live up to it's hype? I still say that this is a great movie to watch, I think that there were and still are quite a few haters that for some reason just want to trash the movie because it had won a ton of awards and Leo Mania was born at the time. Everyone is entitled to an opinion, but please don't let the haters bother you from watching this great movie. It has great acting, amazing effects, beautiful costumes, outstanding sets, a well-written story and still looks flawless. Love it or hate it, you have to admit this movie didn't get a lot of hype just because of Leo's baby face or Kate's amazing ability to cry on sight, this film is something special. Otherwise I don't think we'd still be talking about it so many years later. Kate and Leo had this amazing chemistry that in my opinion made it one of the greatest love stories of all time. Despite the story not being the most original with the rich girl loves poor boy plot, I think it worked extremely well because they fit so well together. James Cameron, the extreme perfectionist that he is, went over time and money budgets for Titanic, but this was his baby and it paid off very well. James had captured everything about Titanic and the sinking so well. He respectfully shows what terror the victims went through that night and made sure that this wasn't just a love story but to remember those who lost their lives on the tragic voyage. He had every right in my opinion to scream ""I'm king of the world!"" at the Oscars, because this movie blew everyone out of the water(no pun intended), you know what? I'm going to admit it, I love Titanic, even past my teen years I absolutely adore this movie, it will always hold a special place in my heart, it has too since I saw this film 8 times in the theater when it was released. Remember one thing, be true to yourself, don't follow the crowd, lovers or haters, if you go with the hype you're always going to go crazy over a film before viewing it, then if you thought the film was just alright for some reason it comes off as the worst movie ever. I do recommend Titanic, it's a great one and sure to go down in the classics one day.10/10",Titanic
44,MovieAddict2016,The Most Loathed Film Of All-Time,8,10 July 2006,"I gave this film a bad review on IMDb in 2002. I deleted my review today - mainly because I don't agree with it anymore. In fact, I'm not so sure I totally agreed with it when I wrote it. I felt an obligation to hate this movie because people who like it are typically made fun of. But I have to admit: I _do_ like it. Yes, the romantic subplot is silly to the extent that Jack would never find himself anywhere near Rose to begin with. But you know what? The romance provides a nice outlet through which to frame the actions of the Titanic's sinking. A three-hour movie about random people on a boat that's going to sink would be a true bore. James Cameron - despite his personal flaws - is a great storyteller and by focusing on characters before heading on to the carnage, he builds a relationship with the viewer. Think of any good historical movie - apart from a few films such as ""The Longest Day,"" most of the time there's a story taking place around the event.As for ""Titanic"" - some people will feel offended. Some people will hate the romantic subplot and find the entire thing unbearably hokey. Some people will make fun of Leonardo DiCaprio (although, thankfully, that phase seems to have passed and he now demands more respect as an actor). And some people will just fast-forward to the end so they can see the Titanic sink (and I'm really hoping that wasn't a spoiler for anyone - because if it was, you need to go take a middle school history course again).The acting isn't bad. Leonardo DiCaprio picked up a lot of misery for his acting here. But he's gone on since to prove, like Johnny Depp, that he's more than just a pretty face. His performances in films such as ""The Aviator"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"" echo his early work in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" - he's one of this generation's finest actors. It's no wonder Scorsese enjoys working with him so much. It may almost seem absurd to even make this comparison, but after some of his recent films DiCaprio has struck me as another Robert De Niro: he has the talent and the intelligence. It's a shame the success of ""Titanic"" pushed him back for a few years.Kate Winslet, on the other hand, is a nice contrast against DiCaprio, however I didn't totally buy their romance at all times and they're not the best screen couple in cinema history by any means. Meanwhile, in the Villain Department, Billy Zane is, for once, not bald.If you don't think you'll like it, you probably won't. It's one of those films that people either love or hate. If you didn't like ""Braveheart"" there's a good chance you'll hate this as well.If you can watch it with an open mind, however, and accept its romantic angle, you may enjoy it.",Titanic
45,DKosty123,Next To Last Blockbuster At Theatre Box Office,9,5 December 2006,"In 1997, this film became a must see for a lot of people. There were several factors that caused this. The film featured some of the first shots of the actual Titanic on the ocean floor after it sank. It featured early glimpses of the technology that had been developed by Robert Ballard to get those pictures. It offered one of the first true tellings of how the ship really sank as finding it in the ocean had finally revealed more details about what really happened to it.This movie has the trade mark James Carmeron hokey love story. He just re-did it in the Sci-Fi movie Avatar. This is becoming the trademark of all his films as Avatar is his first movie since this one. Will Cameron ever do a movie without one?Titanic's story is better than Avatar simply because the story here is framed better. There is true History here to base the film on & this is much better than the story for Avatar which is negative without merit. We have the ship of dreams, the star of the ocean diamond, the provocative drawing. We have the ultimate ship which has become legend for yet another generation thanks to this epic remake. The love story is Camerons jewel & the necklace the ultimate symbol.Leonardo DiCaprio has the highlight role of his career here. So far, no role he has done since matches it. This film was the right time & right place for him. Right place because he got to play after the luscious Kate Winslet. She was another unknown to most audiences, but so far this is her best film too. The rest of the cast is OK, but other than the actress who plays Kate as an old lady, they don't stand out much.Special effects appealed to sell tickets too. The ship sets were so expensive, so well done & so detailed, that they actually became tourist attractions after the movie was made there. Add all these factors plus no real other film in theaters when this was released, & you understand why it sold so many tickets.It might be the last movie to sell so many tickets. Well made hit films now do well for a few weeks, but then a lot of folks wait for the DVD before they watch it. This & the new television technology which has made home theater type television possible, has changed the public theater into a less appealing venue.Do I like this film? Yes, it is a good film, but 1 viewing is all I needed to take it all in. I still dream about Kate Winslet & wish Leonardo would try & match his acting in a newer effort.",Titanic
46,lasttimeisaw,Titanic,9,3 October 2012,"To admit this is the first time I have watched TITANIC from A to Z might hinder my credibility as a serious film critic (as least a self-acclaimed title), I have had several sketchy viewings during all these years but never conquered it entirely, then all of sudden it occurred to me a few days ago this is the biggest loophole in my filmography which I should mend ASAP, so after the lengthy 3 hour saga, now I could feel calmer in facing the numerous household names still stuck in my to-be-watched list and meanwhile other potential newcomers have never stopped emerging.To be honest with oneself, no one could deny TITANIC is a monumental masterpiece, the visual stunts are so compelling and marvel me in its verisimilitude of reconstructing such a monolith setting (what's more indomitable is the fact that it has survived a 15 year interval which should have been a light-year in the evolution of digital technology, and will still stand out not only among its peers). Also the film is a well-crafted emotional vehicle of a catastrophe depicting in an impeccable way to render immaculate empathy towards its audience as if we were literally heading towards our own doomsday (I did redden my eyes when the valedictory score was accompanying the final farewell). The love story of Jack and Rose, although being a bit predictable and the black or white of the character development is somewhat perfunctory given the ample running time it has, could universally strike a chord in any corner of the world, DiCaprio and Winslet have generated unparalleled chemistry on screen (especially for Kate, since she has a more narrative arc to accomplish). Billy Zane, whose past 15 years has testified that he could never outshine this tailor-made character. Gloria Stuart and Katy Bates are both in my top 10 list of the supporting category, and since I'm re-watching DOWNTON ABBEY these days, whose correlation with TITANIC has suggested that all the first-class passengers don't need to change any outfit to be grafted into the red-hot show, maybe Katy Bates could reprise her role as the survival of the calamity, Julian Fellowes might give it a shot. To be the all-time highest grossing film in North America, and the runner-up if put under the international parameter (after Cameron's own brooding AVATOR 2009, 9/10), TITANIC has every reason to be loved by the majority of the mass, and it may not be among the top- tier darling among orthodox film critics, but will remain as a tenacious one in my list. Another afterthought is that I hope AVATOR will look as fabulous as TITANIC now when 2024 eventually arrives.",Titanic

I want to like this film because Leonardo DiCaprio is in the film because I like him - he's a great actor! But I could not get past the fictional romance the movie was focused on. I was hoping for more of a documentary type of a film but, alas, it was not so.The casting and acting was quite good! The set was realistic as well. There are good moments in the movie so I can't knock it completely.IDK, maybe I will have to be alone and in a romantic mood to enjoy this movie more than I actually did the first couple times I viewed it. Or, maybe, I really did want a modern documentary type of movie on The Titanic.I hate to dislike this film but I do. It's a movie I should at least like better than I do but I do not.

48,KineticSeoul,Has all the right elements to be a great romance movie for the mainstream audience,7,6 June 2012,"I saw this movie when it first came out in theater and the whole theater was packed and for good reason. This has many elements to make a good romance movie, yeah it gets a bit sappy and corny but that is passable. I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie when it first came out but acted like I hated it for the sake of hating it. Because it came out sometime when I was in elementary school and all the kids back then was making fun of this movie. Although some of them probably enjoyed watching this movie as well. This is the movie that made Leonardo DiCaprio and made him a teenage heartthrob. So the plot is basically this to put it simply, it's about a romance that blossoms on a ship called Titanic between a poor guy named name Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCario) and Rose(Kate Winslet). But Rose is engaged to a douche but the romance between Jack and Rose increases even during the sinking of the ship. I am not giving anything away since anyone that knows a bit of history knows that the Titanic sank. And when the human nature when it comes to survival kicks in, that is done in a pretty realistic manner. Even if the romance aspect of this movie is pretty straightforward but at least it's engaging and that is what matters. Everything from the cinematography to special effects were phenomenal for a movie from the late 90's and it's still spot on today. I finally got the chance to see this movie in 3D again and it was still good. And the conversion to 3D is done well.7.9/10",Titanic
49,OllieSuave-007,An Epic Tragedy.,6,26 November 2013,"This is an epic tragedy movie about aristocrat Rose DeWitt Bukater falling in love with poor artist Jack Dawson, aboard the doomed Titanic. It is a beautiful but typical love story that captures the audience's hearts, providing a compelling subplot among the more tragic main story of the ill-fated voyage.Many of the movie's element was directed with excellence: the actors provided a solid and believable performance; the cinematography was beautiful; the music score was moving; and the sceneries and settings aboard the ship, amidst the flashy and famed lifestyles of aristocracy and amidst the poor but carefree lives of the townspeople and artists, were brilliant.The scenes of each character's fate after the Titanic started sinking is extremely powerful, haunting, and sometimes disturbing. The film quickly shifts from an emotional love story, which I thought was, unfortunately, pretty boring, to a heart-wrenching tragedy that cannot help but send chills down your spine (where most of the action lies).This movie is a little on the long side though, with several filler scenes that drag away from the main plot. Some sequences of Jack and Rose were pretty cliché - reminding you too much of a teenage-bop love story. While I am not a big drama fan, this movie is a good exception for pure, dramatic entertainment, but not one I would watch over and over again.Grade C",Titanic
50,Red-Barracuda,"Ultimately, a unique and unusual film",7,18 March 2011,"Seeing as Titanic is one of the most financially successful films of all time and whose storyline is know by almost everybody, I have decided not to base this review so much on the content of the film. Instead I would prefer to to look at how this movie is in fact something of a one-off historically.The uniqueness of Titanic in film history is down to a couple of inter-related things. Firstly, it stands apart as being a picture that combines state-of-the-art special effects technology within the frame-work of a romantic epic. Never before or since has this been done and it goes some way to explain the film's phenomenal success. This leads onto the other element of Titanic that is unusual – the fact that a mega-budget blockbuster was quite clearly aimed primarily at women. Again, in the age of the blockbuster this tactic is just not the done thing. James Cameron has always been an action film director who is very female-aware. From Aliens through to Avatar, his movies always feature unusually strong women in central roles; often as the main identifiable action figure. So perhaps it's not, therefore, surprising that with Titanic Cameron should create the ultimate female-centric special-effects blockbuster. This approach paid off of course, women especially went in droves to see it, and the film went super-nova at the box-office.For the first half of the film we have a romance. A cross-class romance that is doomed from the start, in the same way as we all know the famous ocean liner is. The parallels between these two story lines ultimately compliment each other – the love story gives the disaster a personal edge, while in turn, the disaster gives the love story an epic tragic quality. The first time I watched the film I thought the romantic plot was an unnecessary and annoying addition, the second time I began to understand that it gives the film an emotional basis that it feeds off. I now have a great deal more respect for this most unfashionable and often vilified of Hollywood movies. It's uniqueness in film history too in terms of its approach and audience demographic is also something worth at least a little respect. It's unusual combination of special-effects driven action with period-set romance is not likely to be repeated very soon, and Titanic, therefore, will at the very least remain a one-off in film history.",Titanic
51,sddavis63,A Superb Epic,9,16 November 2002,"I avoided watching this film for the longest time. Long before it was even released I had dismissed it as an over-hyped, over-blown, overly romanticized piece of Hollywood schmaltz, and I wanted nothing to do with it. I never watched it in the theatre. I shook my head in disbelief at the 11 Academy Awards - even though I had never seen it. Then I was asked to be a judge at a high school public speaking contest. One of the girls spoke about this movie. ""It was so great,"" she said. ""You really felt like you were on the ship."" ""Nonsense,"" I thought. I shared my feelings with my fellow judges. One looked at me and said, ""you might be right, but if she liked the movie that much maybe she'll want to learn more about the real Titanic. The movie must have done something right to get her so interested."" ""Well, maybe,"" thought I. Then it finally appeared on Pay TV. ""OK,"" I thought, ""I'll give it a look see."" I didn't want to like it - and I didn't. I loved it! What a great movie.Where to start? First - the directing. My high school public speaking contestant was right. James Cameron does a superb job of creating an almost ""you are there"" type of atmosphere. The gaiety of life aboard the most elegant ship in the world. The nonchalance as news of the iceberg first spreads; then the rising sense of panic. You don't just watch it; you really do feel it. Then - the performances. The lead performances from Kate Winslet (as Rose) and Leonardo DiCaprio (as Jack) are excellent - Winslet's being the superior, I thought, but both were good. They had their rich girl/poor boy characters down to a perfect ""t"" I thought. In my opinion, though, stealing the show was Frances Fisher as Rose's mother. She was perfect as the snobby aristocrat, and you could feel the fear and loathing she felt every time she looked at Jack. Then - the details. I'm no expert on the sinking of the Titanic, but I have a reasonable general knowledge, and this film does a super job of recreating the historical details accurately and then weaving them seamlessly around the fictional romance. Very impressive, indeed. Then - the song. Who can watch this movie and not be taken with Celine Dion's performance of ""My Heart Goes On.""Problems. Well, the romance was perhaps too contrived, in the sense that I just don't accept that Jack could have moved so effortlessly from steerage to first class. (I know he was invited the first time; but he seems to keep getting into first class without being stopped until he's been there for a while.) The realities of the separation of the social classes were much more realistically portrayed, I thought, when the steerage passengers were going to be left locked down there after the ship hit the iceberg while the first class folks got to enjoy half empty lifeboats. A minor quibble, though. This is truly an excellent movie. My only regret is not seeing it in the theatre, where I think it would have been so much more impressive.9/10",Titanic
52,thesar-2,Ready to go Back to Titanic,10,3 March 2013,"When James Cameron staple, Bill Paxton, uttered the words: ""Are you ready to go back to Titanic?"" I hadn't actually been sure as of late. For, I've seen it three times in the theatres back in 97/98 and maybe once more on VHS a year or two later. I've had the score and ""song"" memorized since and, of course, I knew the outcome.Well, when the movie opened, I felt more than ready. Gone were the thoughts: ""Be prepared, this is three plus hours"" and I was once again mesmerized from minute one all the way until minute 194. This near-masterpiece made me miss how movies are supposed to made: with heart and talent. And that year, plenty were: some of other best picture nominations, L.A. Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and As Good as it Gets, were also utterly fantastic. Sadly, since 1997, we're lucky to have ONE made with such heart and incredible talent per year.By now, everyone knows the story and has since copied it multiple times. Let me make this clear: VERY few have made one with such a great script with believable dialogue, excellent actors and above all-else, chemistry. Kate and Leo had it in spades. From the second Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) looked up when new-friend, Tommy (Jason Barry) was talking to him, and saw Rose (Kate Winslet,) I KNEW they captured true love.Since this movie arrived 15 years ago, I've been a pretty good fan of Kate, but not so much Leo. He suffers from Denzelitis whereas almost every role he performs, he's not trying to act; he's JUST trying to win an Oscar. This annoying habit leads to way too much over-acting and an abundance of screaming. (SEE: practically any Leo or Denzel Washington role since 1997.)But...Leo pulled it off here. Truly, he showed such a deep affection, love and purity towards his costar that I believed every word, every action and that Rose's heart will go on. He did it so well, with each viewing, I always envisioned her life, the rest of it from the Titanic sinking until her death with him in her heart.These two, Rose and Jack amongst a few other decent characters, namely the fantastic Kathy Bates as The Unsinkable Molly Brown, were so good and deep that I never mind that it's about an hour and a half or more before the ""special effects"" kick in. I.E. The ship sinks. (Oops, sorry, spoiler.)That's the genius of James Cameron. His heart and soul was in this project. He nearly bankrupted the studio and himself and practically gave himself a bad name prior to opening – which was rescheduled more than once. He didn't just make an hour and half retelling of a sinking ship, even though he had the technology. And he didn't just put two romantic leads together; he made sure that the fictional love backdrop was as real as the amazing sinkage.To give an example of an ""epic"" retelling following Titanic that did not have the qualities needed to further an ""opening buildup"" of a romance is Peter Jackson's King Kong. It was flat, boring and unconvincing. He sure had the talent – Kong looked real, but sadly that CGI character held the most depth in the movie.Beyond the romance – that, yes, made me tear again after all these years/viewings and only because I believed the true love before me, was the ultimate score, one of the best songs, movie hit or not, excellent dialogue spoken – mostly by Leo and Molly Brown, great special effects and breathtaking cinematography. I had to see this on the big screen again, although I would've MOST preferred to have the option of 2-D.I would love to see a new movie of such deep quality and soul like this spend a deserved 15-weeks at number one at the box office that I would strongly stand behind. Recently, The Hunger Games did a decent four weeks at number one, and the highly inferior to both movies, Avatar, did seven. But both were just simple blockbusters. Not heart-felt movies. Not movies I would rate 5/5 stars – my highest honor of reviews.Sadly, James Cameron's follow-up, the Space Gully with Wolves film, Avatar, brought down Titanic's mind-blowing record box-office receipts. Oh, how I wished with the 2012 re-release with the ""ho-hum"" 3-D format would've have reclaimed the top spot. But it isn't to happen. And that's okay. It's still a great movie, still holds up today, still makes me laugh and cry and still makes me feel love all over again for movie making. If you are one of the six people in the world that hasn't seen it, SEE TITANIC.Side Note: Way back in the day, when internet was really just kick starting and we had things like ""I.M.'ing"" each other, I was involved in a long-distance relationship and I actually typed out Céline Dion's song, My Heart Will Go On to my partner that thoroughly made him blush.Side Note II: As stated, I watched this three times in the theatre following its initial release. On the last turn, I was on a first date with a guy – against all warnings from my friends to make Titanic a ""first date"" movie. Well, it did turn out to be the first and last date. This was his first viewing of Titanic and still, he fell asleep around hour one and awoke right before (spoiler!) Jack dies. I know my date was awoken because his snores stopped and he instantly began weeping. Frustrated, I said in a normal voice, despite being in the theatre, ""What do you have to be crying about? You don't even know these characters!"" Yep, that was the last I saw of him.",Titanic
53,Lejink,Voyage To The Bottom Of The Sea,8,10 October 2021,"The big daddy of disaster movies, less a full stop than a triple exclamation mark to the sub-genre. Like a modern-day De Mille, James Cameron sets out a 3 hour plus movie and delays the big event, the encounter with the iceberg, until more than halfway through the feature, confident that by that stage he has the expectant audience in his grip and can hold them for another ninety minutes till the end. I seem to remember lengthy movies like ""Ben Hur"", ""Ryan's Daughter"" or of course ""Gone With The Wind"" coming with an intermission roughly halfway through but there's no such break here as Cameron knows that by the time the water starts to pour into the stricken ship, no one will want to leave their seat.The big question of course is does he do enough in that first 100 minutes to make us care for the central characters he's created, namely Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack and Kate Winslet's Rose. He contrives a highly improbable story around the king of all Magoffins, a long-lost priceless diamond which appears to be the motivation for today's treasure-seeking expedition and asks us to accept that a still-alive 101 year old lady, the subject of a nude portrait found onboard depicted wearing the diamond, holds the key as to its whereabouts.Yes, that framing story, rather like the unlucky Titanic itself, doesn't hold much water when held up to examination being a florid slice of highly-theatrical melodrama, complete with its own pantomime villain in the shape of Billy Zane and I'll be honest in that once the calamity occurs I cared as much, indeed more about the hundreds of fellow-passengers teeming behind the leads, as I knew that they weren't really fictional and represented the 1500 lives lost that day.Putting that aside though, it's all about the effects which even looked at now, almost 25 years on, are truly remarkable. From the ship's engine-room, to its grand dining room and outer decks, the magnificence of the boat is wonderfully recreated while the the fateful crash into the iceberg, the panic which followed, the sinking of the boat and the chilling aftermath of the dead and dying strewn across the freezing Atlantic are conveyed with ""You are there""-type realism.Despite what I said about the importance of the SFX to the whole enterprise, it's impossible to deny the charm of DiCaprio and Winslet's performances and their own chemistry in bringing their highly idealised characters to life, but there's no question at all that the boat is the real star here.",Titanic
54,ElMaruecan82,"At least, ""Titanic"" will never sink ... into oblivion ...",9,23 October 2011,"""Titanic"" was the cinematic phenomenon of the 90's and the worldwide highest grossing film of all time before being dethroned by ""Avatar"", from James Cameron (the only director who could ever beat James Cameron in the box-office). Now, ""Titanic"" has become the quintessential cool-to-hate film, hence one of the most controversial Best Picture winners, which is surprising because if anything, the movie screams 'Best Picture'. There's something quite unique in the way the huge success of ""Titanic"" became a defining key of detestation, challenging any attempt for a rational appreciation. Well, we're in 2011 now : the hype has passed, CGI became a tiresome trend providing a series of unoriginal special-effects-driven films, Kate won an Oscar and Scorsese injected some cinematic botox on Leo's ex-pretty-boy face. In these circumstances, I believe we have enough distance to judge ""Titanic"" again, regardless of all the peripheral elements that contributed to its success, back then, in 1997 When ""Titanic"" was released, I was the kind of teenager who avoided any mainstream phenomenon, needless to say that I categorically refused to be brainwashed by the ""Titanic"" wave. The film was the absolute must-see and the girls were all drooling over Di Caprio, and you couldn't listen to the radio or watch TV musical programs without having the annoying flute of Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"". I was far from imagining that this music would define my personal nostalgia of the late 90's. Then the movie grabbed 11 Oscars, it was the most watched and re-watched film ever and I even had to make an essay about ""Titanic"" at school, where I eagerly expressed that the 'Iceberg story left me cold'But suddenly something strange happened. The bubble of popularity popped, some little fellows displayed a childish pride of having disliked the film. And I can't count how many girls were so pleased to say that Leo was too girlish, when one year before, he had an 'angel face'. Then I reversed my position, and from the enthusiasm of having avoided the film, I wanted to understand why people were being so hypocritical with their own appreciation, and feel guilty as if they admired a naked Emperor, with all flash and no substance. This is how ""Titanic"" gradually became the 'cool-to-hate' film, because it's always cool to hate popular stuff, but it's so uncool to try to be cool so this was my personal encouragement to give it a chance in 1999, and to know where I stood for. I came, I saw and I liked it.I'm not even afraid to admit that I loved it, it had everything I was expecting, it was spectacular, thrilling, romantic, and didn't rely too much on special effects except for the terrific sinking part. Yes, the film flirts with cinematic clichés sometimes, the whole 'follow your heart' message is almost Disney-like, but this is the point of the film, it's the romance with the Titanic as a setting, not the Titanic's story featuring a romance. When we think of ""Titanic"", we have less the image of the ship breaking in half in our minds, than Kate and Leo flying over the sunset, this is the defining image of the film and one of the most iconic of American Cinema. And this is the strength of the film.A few recent movies have managed to achieve a classic status so quickly, and so impacting the way ""Titanic"" did and this is certainly due to the constant symbiosis between the story and the special effects that provided the 'classic' vibe, and whether it was intentional or not, it sure succeeded. ""Titanic"" has the thrills, the romance, and an inspirational message, simple enough to appeal to all the sensitive hearts all over the world. And seriously, let's not get too cynical about the marketing campaign, and deny the artistic value of some of the most financially successful films. There's a time for Independent films and another one for spectacular blockbusters  as long as there is a good story, justifying the use of special effects, and the exhilarating sinking sequence.""Titanic"" had the intelligence to have a sort of classic story that could appeal on a universal level. A love story undermined by a tragedy, it's sad and inspiring, a love story between a rich aristocratic woman and a third-class youthful and optimistic boy, it's universal, the whole tragedy of the ""Titanic"" has been touched by a cinematic grace that made it one of the greatest American classics, and I mean 'great' in the classic meaning of the world. And I better take an innocent story, even naive, rather than a spectacular but dull one, like ""Independence Day"" one year before or a thought-provoking but manipulative one, like ""Saving Private Ryan"" the year after. So, I loved ""Titanic"", I felt for the characters, the part where one mother reads a story for her children while the ship sinks will haunt me forever, the music beautifully conveys the innate sadness of a rather passionate romance. The film revives the greatest tradition of the disaster genre with a perfectionism that finally paid-off, and I applaud James Cameron for that. And now, I wonder what the haters hate in the film, what makes ""Lord of the Rings"" so deeper than ""Titanic"", love story, good vs. evil? Don't they miss the young Leo who could smile and shout even the cringe-worthy ""king of the world"" line? Regarding the actual cinematic trends, ""Titanic"" is a classic among the classics and the deserving Best Picture of 1997.So, I don't find any particular reason to hate this film, and if I ever found one, let's say  uh, the part with the necklace which I didn't really care for, well, for one reason to dislike the film, I can find ten to love it. Disliking ""Titanic"" just because it was once so popular is simply a titanic mistake",Titanic
55,paul2001sw-1,A sinker,5,18 August 2003,"Superficially, the loss of the Titanic is a strange theme for a movie, since we all know what happened before it even starts.  But ""Apollo 13"", despite its faults, showed that a story of this sort (albeit one with a happier ending) can still succeed through a low-key focus on the human condition in a state of adversity.  For ""Titanic"", however, writer-director James Cameron has chosen to embellish the facts with a predictable and cliched romance, in which Kate Winslet's feisty, intelligent (and way too modern) heroine overcomes the stupidities and rigidities of her privileged background to learn about herself and life through the love of Leonardo diCaprio.  Boy-man diCaprio appears hopelessly miscast, playing a ""man of the world"" in the fashion of the lead in a high school rom-com.  In fact, his role is a pretty straight reprise of his Romeo in Baz Luhrmann's brilliant Shakespeare adaptation - but whereas the whole of that film was imaginatively conceived so that this character worked in that role, in Titanic he is desperately unconvincing in a piece of social commentary that prefers corn to meat at every opportunity.Yet oddly the film is compelling to watch, at least until the iceberg hits, precisely because you know what must come in the end.  But when the boat starts to sink, so does the film.  When the natural drama of the situation begins to climax, Cameron focuses instead on the ludicrous personal melodrama of his leads, and an extended action sequence that makes ""Star Wars"" seem believable by comparison.  The final sinking, by contrast, is actually quite moving, though needless to say, presented with a minimum of economy.Overall, ""Titanic"" is a contradictory film.  Its massive budget shows in the beautiful attention to visual detail (particularly in the mighty portrayal of the engine room), and the bombastic force with which the director combines the private and the public sides of an unquestionably massive movie.  But it also shows in the good-versus-evil plotting, the way that every scene is milked for more than it's worth, the need to tie everything up with a semi-satisfying moral knot, and the general violation of the principle of Occam's razor (i.e. ""it is vain to do with many what can be done with fewer"").  Both an awesome spectacle and a perfect example of what is wrong with Hollywood, ""Titanic"" is a true film of its era.  But watch ""Das Boot"" instead for a real maratime epic.",Titanic
56,Pjtaylor-96-138044,A sinking feeling.,6,21 May 2020,"'Titanic (1997)' is bogged down by arguably unnecessary modern day sequences, its run-time sailing well beyond the time it actually took for its eponymous ship to sink. These opening and closing moments are what started Cameron's seemingly unending obsession with deep-sea documentation and, in some ways, seem a little too indulgent. However, they do add a layer of theming to the thing and sort of explain the director's motives in making a massively budgeted, romantically focused epic out of one of the most well-known tragedies of the twentieth century. Once the piece progresses into its bulk, it starts to become a lot more interesting. The film revels in its splendid set-design and CG-enhanced environments, marvelling at its own ability to aptly convey the period and paying immense attention to even the smallest of details (though it's apparently content with 'filling in the gaps' any way it pleases). At times, the picture feels rather self-congratulatory, to be honest. However, this confidence is mostly well-placed; the movie did, after all, make over a billion dollars. Just because it made money doesn't mean it's automatically good, though. It's undeniably messy and slow, somewhat confused as to whether it wants to be a straight-forward historical tragedy or an alternate-history 'against all odds' romance (and that's not even mentioning the reflexive, somewhat self-aware vibes of the modern day stuff). Having said that, it's effective on more than one occasion. Some of the romantic banter between its leads is charming, as is their overall relationship, and the 'clash of the classes' angle is generic but enjoyable. Any time DiCaprio and Winslet share the screen, the film is fairly entertaining. However, it doesn't get properly gripping until the DVD asks you to change disks halfway through. This latter half is dedicated, almost entirely, to the sinking of the ship. This is a well-known fact and, frankly, a key selling point of the picture, so it isn't exactly a surprise. Yet, the extended sequence does a good job of maintaining tension by introducing mini conflicts which don't have a pre-determined end. This segment contains some visually spectacular stuff, as water floods corridors or crushes characters against gates and the whole ship turns on its side as it sinks to the depths below. Thankfully, this stuff isn't beautiful; it's devastating. Some of it is really suspenseful, too. It's the most successful aspect of the piece, for sure - although it does feature a shot that demonstrates literally the worst 'face replacement' I've ever seen. When it comes down to it, the flick isn't as impactful as it should have been. It struggles to balance its two major elements, feels unnecessarily long and is often somewhat self-indulgent (and, thus, rather dull). It is, however, a visually spectacular and occasionally charming experience with a highly effective final third. It's long and uneven, but it's probably worth a go if you're a fan of DiCaprio, Winslet, Cameron or, somewhat strangely, historical tragedies. 6/10",Titanic
57,g-bodyl,Mind Blowing!,10,2 February 2011,"James Cameron is one of the best directors of all time. I have never seen him make a bad movie. This and his most recent Avatar are in the top ten of my favorite all time films. I know when a movie is very good is when I choke up. I did that for several scenes in this three-hour epic. The wonderful score by James Horner initiated some of those teardrops.This is about the fateful night in mid-April of 1912 when the luxury liner Titanic sank. Also, there is a romance story between a guy from the lower class and a girl from the upper class.The acting is pretty great. Yes there were some cheesy lines but so what. The brilliant performances of Kate and Leo make up for it.I can't see why people blast this movie with their criticisms. Maybe it was successful and it made tons of money.Overall, this is one of the best movie of all times. There's a reason why it won eleven Academy awards. I rate this film 10/10.",Titanic

Best Performance: Leonardo DiCaprio",Titanic
59,CuriosityKilledShawn,Too big to fail.,8,24 January 1999,"Titanic wasn't the first attempt at turning the sinking of the big boat into a theatrical epic, but it's by far the best and will never, ever be bettered. Cameron's minute attention to detail, commitment to realism, and epic vision are light years ahead of the German Propaganda version, a Night to Remember (where the ship sinks whole), the dull Catherine Zeta Jones version, or the tawdry ITV mini-series.The hugeness of the production is every bit as impressive at the ship, and the savage critics predicted that the film was doomed to fail as hard as its subject matter. Nope! Titanic went on to be a $2 billion hit and scoop 11 Academy Awards.Despite the many positive reviews there are always film snobs who love to pick faults in popular culture phenomenons. But I think Titanic is more than that and doesn't deserve any nit-picking. It's easy to focus on inconsequential details, but Titanic has few faults. The worst I can say of it is that Leo DiCaprio's acting is sometimes a bit aggravating. Apparently Macauley Culkin was considered for the part of Jack Dawson. Now THAT was have been awesome.Many snobs have called the characters flat and uninteresting. It's hard to develop such a wide cast in a film set within a short space of time (not including the 84 year time-span of the story). But the two and a bit days that the ship manages to sail before it sinks does have plenty of drama and development so anyone who complains otherwise is just deliberately being fickle. I don't even think that Billy Zane comes across as a caricature, as others have gleefully pointed out. Caledon Hockley IS actually a complex, and somewhat sympathetic character. I know he's the antagonist (or maybe the iceberg is), but the fact that he still searches for Rose on the deck of the Carpathia means that he really does love her, in a way.Once the iceberg hits, at the 100-minute mark, the editing and timing (not quite real-time, but close) is perfect. The growing panic matches the rising water as Captain Smith walks around in a daze, completely unable to be believe that it REALLY IS HAPPENING. The hole in the hull doesn't seem to be a problem at first, but two hours later anyone not on a lifeboat is doomed.In a way it's an end-of-the-world movie as much as a romance or disaster. The Titanic was a microcosm of human society, and despite its status as the biggest ship ever built it really was a tiny, fragile speck on a dark, unforgiving ocean. Even as a child, long before I ever saw the film, I thought that the sinking of it represented the futility of mankind trying to conquer the ocean and the meaningless of wealth.It's a very different film from Terminator or True Lies, but James Cameron has always kept a gritty, earthy tone to his movie. Titanic isn't, but his commitment to realism keeps it consistent to his other movies.I don't think it's the best movie ever, but it scores almost full marks for everything. Titanic deserves to be seen on the big screen, which is why I have only seen it twice. The new 3D conversion looks great, and with a few corrections to the content of the film, and the digital projection itself, now really IS the time to revisit the ship.",Titanic

62,ironhorse_iv,If you haven't yet saw Titanic. Get onboard! Titanic is king of the world!,8,14 June 2014,"When you talk about 1990's pop culture, it's really hard to not mention, the biggest blockbuster from that decade, Oscar Winner, Best Picture of 1997's Titanic. Directed, written, by James Cameron, the movie had everything that people wish to see in a movie, making it one of the biggest money makers of all time. The movie had plenty of action, history, romantic, and music to get everybody onboard. The movie gives a fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic in April 14, 1912. It tells the story of two members of different social classes, high socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) and working class, Jack Dawson (Leonardo Dicaprio) falling in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage. The movie was so popular, that a 3D version of the film was released on April 4, 2012 to commemorate the centennial of the sinking, earning it more money. The 3D version was pretty good. Titanic spun a number of other successful things such as; musicals, soundtrack, hundreds of different types of merchandise, books about the Titanic, a video game about Titanic and countless rip-offs movies. I think a good reason why a lot of people went to see this movie is how simple the story is. Yes, it's a bit predictable and pretty recycled from old Hollywood style that previous Titanic type movies had, such as 1958's A Night to Remember & 1953's Titanic. You can really see it, if you look close enough. It's full of familiar tropes and clichés. Still, the movie concept really got update to epic scale with the expensive budget, well use, in the films visual, special effects, costume, sets, and other sides of the production. James Cameron really made the movie felt like it overlap a lot of genres. It was great historical romantic action movie with many subplots like a treasure finding mystery suspense, a horror lifetime movie melodrama about female abuse, a social commentary film about classism and social Darwinism, etc. etc. Indeed, the movie is mostly label as a love movie, and this is where some people might be turn off. People do love story, when there is something in stake. By putting their lives in stake, people want to see them overcome the dangers. People also love movie if the two actors playing a couple really do show on chemistry on film. Both Leo & Kate did well in their roles showing their charm, but their characters don't have much depth to them. We really don't see, much faults in them. Their characters are very simplistic people. Also, some of their dialogue made the love story seem unrealistic or too silly to be taken serious of. Some people might hate the song by Celine Dion, 'Heart will go on' but in my opinion, the song works so well. I do think, it does get a little bit overplayed. I also have to give mad props to James Horner's score. All of the music in the film does give the movie, its great epic romantic tone and later, it's intense edge. I had lots of fun, watching the Titanic lower class party. The music there, really fit the scene. The movie also has great cinematography, as it was all eye candy to me. You can't help going in front of any ship bow, and not think of that scene from this movie. Indeed, you're feel like you're flying. For a PG-13 movie, I was deeply surprise how erotic, it was. I was just a little kid, when it first came out, the movie was the first time; I noticed that women had pubic hair. I found the sex scenes and the nudity to be tasteful. Still, the whole love affair, really does undermine, the time wasted that could cover the real victims of the Titanic sinking, more. While the actors playing supporting historical characters were all great in their roles. They were also all one-dimensional props. I still felt emotional to them, when 'Nearer, My God, to Thee,' to the tune of Bethany was playing. It was hard not to feel something about the film. Another thing people might hate is the pacing. The movie is really long and seem slow at times. The movie is also a bit historical inaccurate, but the movie went into great details to make the movie seem like the Titanic, you see here is the real Titanic. Buy the DVD as there are a lot of great special features like delete scenes, commentary, and behind the screens. The 2012 DVD version also clean up some of the big mistakes. It felt like the special edition that wasn't destroy the original work. If you happen to find it on TV, just note that it will be cut down, and censor a bit. It's nearly unwatchable. Overall: Sink or swim. Is the movie, the best Titanic movie ever? So-far, yes. Is it the worst? So-Far-no. It was safe exceptionalism type of movie. I wouldn't say, it's the smartest movie, but I would say, its lack of complexity doesn't make it not watchable. From the opening shot to the bittersweet ending, it was just amazing to watch. This movie like the actual event will always be remember on.",Titanic
63,The-Sarkologist,"Despite all the hype, this is still a good movie",7,21 December 2013,"James Cameron is an amazing filmmaker. He made Terminator II, Abyss, and Aliens, and he has made this movie; one that is going to require some absolute brilliance to beat (what was I thinking when I wrote this?). At the end I just sat in my chair and did not say anything, there is nothing that can describe this movie. This is how a love story should be made.Titanic is a tragedy pure and simple. Right from the beginning you know that the ship is going to sink. We, the audience, knows what is going to happen, but we watch the crew and the wealthy wonder around fully convinced that the ship is invincible. All the problems with the ship are not known until after the ship has begun to sunk. The important part is the iceberg; they could not see it until it was too late to do anything about.This movie really brings out the contrast between the rich and the poor and brings out the idea that they seem to be two different people who live in two different worlds. On the Carpathia, the ship that picked up the survivors of the Titanic, when the wealthy fiancé is looking for his beloved, he comes onto the deck full of the survivors from third class. The sailor says to him, ""there is nobody of your kind down here."" The distinction is purely artificial though. When Jack is invited up to dinner in first class, he is dressed up and the comments are that he is like one of them. The only difference between the two is the money, one has it while the other does not. But is having money all that good? The movie seems to say that it is not. We see Rose attempting to commit suicide, yet she has everything she could hope for as she is to marry a wealthy steel magnate.Yet Rose finds more interest in the young bohemian artist named Jack Dawson. She is willing to throw everything away just for this one young man. Of course this makes her fiancé extremely jealous, but deep down she doesn't want him. Her continual snide remarks at the lifestyle of the rich shows that she doesn't want any part of it. Neither does Jack, for he refuses the caviar, traditionally the food of the rich, and is in quite a hurry to get out of the first class dinning room and back to steerage where the lower classes are.The distinction is really brought out when the ship is sinking. The third class passengers are locked below while the first class passengers are piling onto the lifeboats. Their belief that they are above the others goes to the point where they take off in lifeboats without the full capacity. The utter despicableness of this is fully realised when one sees all the dead floating in the Atlantic afterwards. The rich are only concerned for their own lives and the others just die for all they care. Only those who have money are important.The true evil of this comes out with the idea of women and children first. Even though they say that, there are men climbing onto the boats and looking for a way off the ship. These rich people are not interested in sacrifice, but in preserving their own lives. Cal, Rose's fiancé, comes out even more wicked as he takes a lost girl only to use her to get onto a lifeboat, and when it looks as if the lifeboat will sink, he throws her away. He even beats people back into the ocean so as not to swamp his boat.Sacrifice in love is one that comes in through this movie, not greatly, but it is there. True love is when one is willing to sacrifice their lives to save others. We see that Jack constantly orders Rose onto the lifeboats, but Rose, more so, will not let him die alone and keeps on coming back to him. There seems the idea that love comes out of wanting to die together, but even so, we see an act of love, or sacrifice, at the end. The real idea of love as serving the one you love does not really come out, but that is an Americanism. Love is a special feeling, so they say, that happens between two people. Still, there is a lot of putting one's life on the line for the other in this movie, which is what love really is about.My only real gripe is the final scene in the movie, but that I ignored. It was just a stupid Americanism to give the movie a happy ending. If I were to rewrite the ending, then I would finish it with the Heart of the Sea sinking into the water.",Titanic

65,paulclaassen,"Despite a lot of plot flaws and conveniences, this really is one of the best films ever made.",10,3 July 2018,"Ah, yes, the film that propelled Leonardi DiCapro to super stardom, became the first film to gross $1 billion, and stayed on the top of the box office charts for 12 years (only to be kicked off the top by another James Cameron film, Avatar).It is said 'Titanic' is the film with the most continuity errors of all films. Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing. I must admit, the jumping backwards and forwards in time was a bit unnecessary and resulted in an overlong epic. They should only have told the 1912 story. Apart from that, the film was thrilling, exciting and fascinating in every sense of the word!",Titanic

68,didi-5,Titanically Awful,2,11 February 2004,"'Titanic' looked so promising, but personally I would say it is the worst film ever made.  Not only does it lay aside any consideration of real stories that happened on the ship, but it constructs a piece of ridiculous class-divide mush instead!Leonardo di Caprio (excellent in Romeo + Juliet) and Kate Winslet fail to convince as Jack and Rose, a boy from steerage and a girl from first class. And Billy Zane was downright embarrassing as Rose's stuck-up fiance.  There were some good performances - Kathy Bates as Molly Brown, Bernard Hill as Captain Smith, even Gloria Stuart as the elderly Rose - but they are few and far between.The biggest problem I had with the film though was the god-awful script and scenes.  Corny lines ('as we walk through the valley of death'/'could you walk a little faster?').  The scene in the car where the windows mist up just at the crucial moment.  The ridiculous pose at the head of the ship. And perhaps worst of all, the clean water and the fact that Winslet keeps travelling in the lift - downwards - as the ship floods.Watching 'Titanic' for me was a total waste of over 3 hours and an excruciating experience.  May I never have the misfortune to see even a minute of it again.",Titanic
69,zkonedog,An Epic In (Mostly) Every Sense Of The Word,8,25 February 2017,"For those who were of serious movie-watching age in 1997, ""Titanic"" was more than just a movie...it was a cultural milestone. In an era before the Internet was as omnipresent as it is today, ""Titanic"" still managed to transcend its celluloid and become part of pop culture lore. It easily vaulted to the top of the all-time charts (though has now been passed by ""Avatar"" and ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens""). However, along the way ""Titanic"" gained a bit of a reputation as a ""chick flick"", what with ""dreamy Leo"" and the somewhat schmaltzy romance between him and Kate Winslet's character. Fortunately, what I've learned after a recent re-watch of the film is that it still manages to hold up as an epic for all-comers (at least for the most part) despite its branding as sappy.For a basic plot summary, ""Titanic"" tells the story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), both passengers on the maiden (and obviously final) voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic. Rose is a member of the ""upper crust"" first class, pledged to be wed to the stodgy, controlling Cal (Billy Zane). Jack is a free-wheeling vagabond who wins his ticket in a poker game just minutes before the ship departs. On the first night of the voyage, Rose has a breakdown and is about to jump from the bow of the ship...until she is stopped by the charming Jack. A Romeo and Juliet-esque romance begins, coming to a head when the great boat strikes an iceberg and beings taking on water.The main reason I can appreciate ""Titanic"" is because I like films that really ""go for it"", so to speak. ""Titanic"" is meant to be an epic, and director/creator James Cameron pulls out all the stops to make that happen. The visually sequences are stunning (the CGI is a bit visible by today's standards, but not terrible), the scope of the project is momentous, and the romance is just as over-the-top to match. Had a lesser film tried to get away with some of the Jack-and- Rose cheesiness pulled here, it would have been a disaster. But for some reason, it just works in ""Titanic"" (again, I think because of the epic nature of the whole project).Cameron also could not have picked a better setting for an epic. We are now over 100 years removed from the fateful sinking, yet it is an event that still carries a high level of fascination...the ""unsinkable ship"" sinks to the bottom of the Atlantic. I think Cameron also makes a great decision to go the high-drama route, as this easily could have been turned into an ultra-realistic pseudo-documentary of the event. I'm sure that (knowing Cameron's style) much research was done to make things as accurate as possible, but the fictional presence of Jack and Rose adds that layer of high drama that turns the whole production into a prestige event.The only reason I can't give ""Titanic"" the full five stars? Well, there's two, actually: First, Cameron really lays the ""class differences"" stuff on thick in the latter stages of the film. It is set up perfectly in the beginning, but as the film drew to a close I wanted to be enthralled by the sinking visuals or swept away in the sheer emotion, not be constantly beaten over the head with the ""first class are conniving snobs while third class are the unsung heroes"" trope. I know from ""Avatar"" that Cameron has little qualms about obviously sticking his own beliefs into films (and doing so quite heavily), so maybe that's just par for the course for his films. Secondly, I honestly believe that better casting could potentially have been done with the Rose character. In no way do I wish to demean the talents of Kate Winslet, as I know she is a wonderful actress in her own right, but I never felt like she was right for this part. She is great as the uptight Rose, but I never really bought into her as the ""moon-eyed lover"" of Jack. It felt odd to me. Luckily, DiCaprio is a joy to behold on screen in the film, so some of the chemistry issues are solved by his sheer enthusiasm.I think that ""Titanic"" is one of those movies that got so big, so fast, that now its reputation proceeds it a bit. I found a similar thing happened to the film ""Dead Poet's Society"". Whereas now standing up on a desk to make a point is ""old hat"", there was a time when it was truly riveting. That same logic must apply to ""Titanic"", too. Whether you are watching it for the first time or re-watching it for the umpteenth time, this is a flick where the slightest bit of cynicism can ruin the entire experience. You have to clear the slate of the mind every single time and enjoy the epic experience for what it is. If you can do that, ""Titanic"" is truly a treasure.",Titanic
70,filipemanuelneto,A very good movie.,8,3 September 2016,"This film focuses on the tragic first voyage of the British luxury steamer RMS Titanic, which sank in the North Atlantic. Directed and written by James Cameron, the film features Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The soundtrack, one of the most iconic of cinema, is James Horner.Titanic will always be the icon of the golden age of maritime passenger transport. The biggest of steamers, the most luxurious of luxury ships, it was the largest ship in the world at the time and it was said that it was unsinkable. Unfortunately, everything is made of iron can sink. The negligence of the responsible for the ship, which ignored all warnings of ice and never prepared it with enough lifeboats to all the people inside it, led to a huge and unnecessary tragedy.In the midst of all, we have the unlikely love between Rose, a rich girl, and Jack, a young who grew up in the streets. It's the classic cliché ""rich girl loves poor boy"" or, in this case, ""adventurer, eager to make a fortune, loves rich and bored girl who wants to feel strong emotions"". Their story is similar to many others and, in addition to never be credible enough, it quickly becomes cloying and boringly predictable, and gives voice to the preconceived ideas of Cameron, showing social ""barriers"" rich/poor ( symbolized in the film by locked doors between the ship classes) as if they were divisions between good and bad. World is not so simple, so dark-and-gray, and divisions like that still exists today, in other ways.The choice of the two main actors was excellent. Although still young and not well known, they have become stars. DiCaprio was the pretty face of the girl's wet dreams for a long time thanks to this movie, and even had to take off the heartthrob image later to diversify his career. In fact, he is a talented actor, as Kate, and both worked well in the romantic scenes. The film also contains stunning scenes of the ship, whose interiors have been carefully re- created and then destroyed during the scene of the wreck. The details are excellent, they were in the collective memory for the quality that was achieved. Special and sound effects are also excellent.",Titanic

72,leplatypus,*** 500th review / 100th Anniversary *** A night to remember (vhs) (screen),10,14 April 2012,"Well, as the Titanic's wreck, i never planned to a night like this. Titanic was released in 1997 and i didn't watch it in theater then. I think i must have said something like this: ""what's the point to see it as we already know how it ends!"". Not very bright but as shown in the movie, that's what life is about: to change for the better. Then, I caught it on TV at its maiden broadcast (in 1999) and i found it great indeed. But, seven years after, when i began writing reviews for IMDb in 2004, it wasn't still on my list because my first task was to review all my DVDs. So now, seven years later, i finally watched and reviewed them all and i intended that my 500th review marks my last ones (to discover what they are, just wait and read my 501th review coming next...).But, yesterday, Saturday 14th April 2012, exactly 100th year after its wreck, i admit that Titanic was heavy on my mind. For us westerners, Titanic was symbolic: the biggest machine man built never made it. I can't say if it's Babel Tower all over again but all its story leads to the unavoidable meeting of this ship and this iceberg. Its thousand victims are the first ranking peacetime tragedy in humankind. Indeed Titanic was indeed the summit because western civilization never got higher later. However, i still didn't want to see it that day on 3D screen because i planned to see it with my family next week when we will be again together (don't worry: i will travel by train!). But, as my fridge was empty and i had to go out, my idea was to go in a bookshop before and buy one good book about Titanic and keep the ticket as well. But there wasn't any special offers at the biggest one in Paris. Hopefully, i could try another one at Champs-Elysées that was also close to a food-store ... and a theater.incidentally, i just took a look at the programing and see that ""Titanic 3d"" was on screen one hour later at 20h40. So, if i would watch it now, it will be nearly at the same time that it sank one hundred years before! It was like all the victims resonated in me and i just bought the ticket and stepped into my first screen viewing of this titan!I think all the names the Titanic had can be also given to this movie. Wonderful, Modern, Outstanding and unsinkable as well! It's one of the best movie ever released and i'm sure it will be celebrated even a century away!I can't name another movie that blends so much history, romance and technology! Cameron and his crew gives so much to get us on the boat and in the same time crafts a powerful love story. If a lot have been said about DiCaprio, Winslet is phenomenal as well. In all cases, it's moving to see a such strong love and what they shared for hours in this flamboyant daylight before the wreck worths lifetime. But the story is also a sincere classes critic and it's good to have a writer/director to give voices to the poors or the women conditions. It's also a formidable testimony of courage for all those braves who stayed on board to help and to finally wait for death (her captain, her designer, Gugenheim, ...)Well, there's a lot to experience in such compartmentalized place and it has been anointed with a last grace: Horner's score is one of the best heard ever and really gives a beating heart to the movie.The final reunion with Jack waiting Rose at the staircase, surrounded with all those brave souls is a definitive moment of filmmaking and it's another memory of a vibrant final moment that I keep in mind (among ""Blade Runner"",""Godfather III"", ""Knowing"" and ""Blood Diamonds"").Well, i take a look at the hour: 2h20 in the morning on 15 April 2012. At this time, Titanic went exactly deep under and actually, i must say that i'm all frozen as well because i wanted to write that review windows open to let the chilly April night enter my room and experience a bit the cold that they faced a century ago...Well, i suppose i wouldn't be there for her 200th birthday but i hope that my heart will go on for hundred reviews like those...RIP",Titanic

There's a simple formula to these movies: the first half hour is the set-up and then the roof caves in. Writer/director/producer James Cameron missed the memo. Cameron takes over an hour and a half to get to the meat and potatoes. It's time wasted. The first half of ""Titanic"" is long and tedious. The bookend story isn't that interesting. The voyage stuff is pure melodrama. The dialogue is corny with way too much ""explaining"". That stuff is informative but it never sounds real. For some reason the strong cast isn't very good either. Overall, they get a grade of C+. It's when ""Titanic"" hits the iceberg that the movie really comes alive. It's exciting and very emotional. The last hour or so is classic. I saw ""Titanic"" twice in the theater. Once when it first came out and the other time was for its 3D re-release. I've also seen it a bunch of times at home (including tonight). I don't watch it as often as I did because I'm starting to really dislike the first half. Dishonorable mention: Kate Winslet's less than thrilling nude scene.",Titanic

79,Anonymous_Maxine,"Visually, Titanic was a stunning masterpiece, but the story and the acting were mediocre and sometimes just outright bad.",6,30 August 2000,"At first glance, Titanic is an epic film. The scenery and cinematogrpahy are spectacular, and it is just a beautifully photographed movie. However, when you look past the superficial beauty of the film, much like Armageddon, its numerous shortcomings become clear. First of all, Titanic suffered badly from the transition from the big screen to video. This took away a lot of the hugeness of the film, and this inadvertently places more attention on the story and the acting, both of which were the biggest problems with the film. I went to see this movie to see the sinking of the Titanic, not to see some elaborately fabricated love story. Titanic is a landmark film as a result of the sinking of the ship and the fact that it inexplicably turned out to be such a huge moneymaker. There is absolutely nothing great about the acting, the story is nothing that hasn't been seen dozens of times before, and the directing is awkward, probably due to the fact that James Cameron, who is an excellent director, is so used to directing the Frankenstein-like Schwarzenegger as the Terminator. This is not to say that the directing was bad, it wasn't at all, but there is nothing special to be said about the directing because James Cameron is not really a director of this type of film.Kate Winslet was beautiful in Titanic. She delivered a wonderful performance in the film and was very convincing, as was Kathy Bates (as always) and even Billy Zane. I normally don't like him, but he was playing a dislikeable character, which is probably why I enjoyed his performance so much. Leonardo DiCaprio, however, delivered the worst performance of his career. If you want to see him really act, watch The Basketball Diaries or, even better, The Beach. Titanic is a beautifully made film. It suffered in the story and the acting departments, but it is an entertaining and easy to watch movie. It was not, however, the best picture of 1997. Not even close. There were probably 20 movies that were released in 1997 that were better than Titanic, but the Oscar's wouldn't have gained as much public support had they not given the Oscar to Titanic. It was a quality film, but don't be fooled by all of the hype.",Titanic

The music by John Horner is brilliant there's this one scene I can recall where Jack and Rose are dancing to some Irish music and they had a lot to drink and their smiling and laughing at each other,THAT was just so well done. Also you gotta love the Celine Dion hit My Heart Will Go On.The story is brilliant in fact this is what REALLY happened on the Titanic and if you come across another movie that says Titanic: The Legend Goes On I suggest you avoid this one and watch this overrated flick instead of it as the animated version well if you seen it you know what its like.Also I loved the chemistry between Winslet & DiCaprio which was so realistic and genuine. Bottom line if you haven't seen it then check it out im telling you,that you won't regret it. I seen it a million times before and if I catch it again on TV at an earlier time than i'll watch it again.10/10",Titanic
82,elshikh4,The Viewer's Heart is a Deep Ocean of Secrets !,6,27 August 2009,"So this is maybe the billion review about (Titanic). The first thing I must say is about me being so irritated of this movie. Surely, when you hear about one movie as the greatest, know that it hit all the records, then get to see it to discover that it's another movie, and how there were many better movies that didn't get 10 % of the popularity that that one had, then you must be as irritated as me!Most of the characters are fine, but not in a capable drama. Let's face it; (James Cameron) wanted mainly a big production disaster movie, not a romantic epic. The start is too long and boring. ""The women's heart is a deep ocean of secrets"" aside from being the movie's only interesting line, it's not that interesting in the first place. Sometimes the man's heart is a deep ocean of secrets also!I hated the nude scene. It's not about me despising nudity in the first place; it's about it as something that ruined the romantic sense of the movie thereafter. Talk about ruining; then it's more than clear that the chemistry between the 2 leads was missing. A lot of viewers, I'm one of them, saw that (Kate Winslet) had more presence than (Leonardo DiCaprio), and looked a bit older than him as well!I can't stand the fact that (Rose) is the one who killed (Jack), when she left him in the icy water. Why she didn't give him a part of raft, or got to be on it for some, then (Jack) for some?? SO SELFISH! And yes, the tragedy of ""My Hard Will Go on""! For anyone who didn't live 1997, that was a complete nightmare pals. This song was everywhere, if you didn't find it in radio, then it would meet you in TV, and when you got red of it, then it would hunt you down successfully from the cars' audio system!I didn't satisfy with the Oscars too. The hyped persona of the movie mirrored itself highly in the Academy Award's night. But it didn't win the script's award. In fact, it couldn't. If something about it is really great, else the global mania, so it is its CGI. (Cameron) dreamed and fulfilled perfectly in that area. Anyhow, this is a very good movie after all. An action fare, a powerful disaster flick, with some romantic moments. It got an old love story yet with a lovely charisma as a whole. But, it only doesn't work for me. Sometimes, it's all the time, you have another taste.Though, I liked some nice bits; like how (Jack) is the youthful lively modernism of this stiff world. Or the part of the musicians playing the music while everything is dying, simply because the artist, the real one, have no message in life but to play their music and to the end of life. And I liked the final scene / Rose's dream where her love goes on and on. But, to tell you the truth, it was one of the excellent endings which you wish another, more deep and satisfying, movie for it!If you looked to the whole history of cinema, you'll find many movies, like (Titanic) or better, whether they were meant to be big hits or just truthful works; they didn't make it to be the most successful ever. It's just a certain moment when the audience needs all what one movie has. However, the audience's necessities remain vague, unpredictable and change from time to time. And whatever the intelligence of any moviemaker is, no one will ever know what exactly these necessities may be in one moment on big scale. Or what the movie to fulfill them can be. Otherwise all the movies out there will be another (Titanic)!(Titanic - 1997) is the absolute chance to explore the mood of the viewer of the twentieth century's end. It presented a love story in the middle of a fallen world / the ship itself. As if the huge, rich and proud civilization is in its way to a near inevitable collapse by hitting an iceberg; where the coldness of all the humans, aka: the icebergs, will kill them eventually, and the only survivor will be love. So the necklace, that somehow can survive too, while representing all the material values; will equal nothing in the end. Notice that the end isn't happy; that's uncommon, as this true lover got no place in our fatally hectic world.It wasn't a coincidence that (Titanic) made it big. It is a clever movie that came in the right moment. But in another moment, that clever movie could've made it to be a mighty flop. It is the viewer's heart which's a deep ocean of secrets. And some movies come in some time, precisely ""in time"", to unlock it.",Titanic
83,freemantle_uk,My heart will go on,8,27 May 2020,"Titanic was a pop culture phenomenon upon its release, breaking box-office and awards records. It obviously struck a chord.Titanic was an old-fashioned romance that happened to be made by a man who used revolutionary techniques. The first half of the film was about two star-crossed lovers from different strata and the second was about the disaster. The setting was used to look at the different attitudes about class and wealth as well as tell an emotional human story. Whilst scenes of the disaster supply lots of peril and excitement.Even though Titanic was a smash hit I doubt it made today because it was over three hours long and not based on a recognisable property. Studios want franchises and avoid making films over two and half hours.",Titanic
84,ianlouisiana,A brilliantly assembled mishmash of movie clihes-wonderful!,9,24 July 2007,"""Titanic"",like ""Gone with the wind"" is one of the great unrateable movies. Just as GWTW caught the imagination of the public in its time so ""Titanic"" repeated the feat sixty years later.Neither one of them is a ""great"" movie in the artistic or intellectual sense,but both of them are great movies in terms of sheer populist entertainment and their grasp of the mood of the moment.Possibly even ""opportunist"" might be the right word. Both of them had huge lead roles and nothing much else for their actors,both featured highly unlikely romances between people from different social stratas.GWTW had the burning of Atlanta,brilliant state - of - the - art filming,and ""Titanic"" has the sinking of the ship which is hugely impressive by any standards. Ten years down the line it looks better to me than it did on it's release. Mr L. diCaprio,a little like a mixture of James Cagney and Mickey Rooney, is feisty and funny as Jack,Kate Winslet full of vitality and a slightly knowing innocence,hold the film together during its occasional longeurs,and their coupling is sweet and funny if highly unlikely. Forget all the ""buts"" and allow yourself to be swept along,lingering in the chandeliered dining rooms, strolling the endless decks and watch the stokers toil in the massive engine rooms like Dore's vision of Hell. The whole thing is a brilliantly assembled mish - mash of movie clichés one following the other seamlessly so that you don't care that you're watching sheer corn because it's so well done. The opening sequence with the 102 year - old Rose on the Diving ship is patiently built up with gradually lengthening flashbacks to 1912. The ending, where Rose,after telling her story goes out on the deck in the middle of the night and lets the priceless diamond she has had all along slip into the ocean then........no,on the remote chance that you haven't seen the movie I won't go any further.But I will pay the ultimate tribute to Mr Cameron and confess that I have watched ""Titanic"" six times and every damn time,no matter how much I tell myself I am being manipulated by a succession of still photographs being projected at just the right speed to cause persistence of vision..........I cry. Furthermore I would say that anybody not similarly affected would not feature highly on my Christmas Card list. This is film - making of the highest order and I take my hat off to everybody involved.",Titanic
85,PWNYCNY,"Even though the ship sank, it's still a very good movie",8,31 July 2005,"Titanic is Hollywood's biggest moneymaker in history and for good reason - it is a great movie. This movie is about sacrifice, selflessness, love, devotion, joy, passion, all occurring on a doomed ocean liner that suddenly and without warning sinks, resulting in one of the worst maritime catastrophes in history. Kate Winslett is magnificent as the young girl, Rose, barely a teenager, who is being pressured by her overbearing mother to marry Cal, a nasty, brutal man who has only contempt for his unwilling fiancé. That Cal is rich just makes his behavior worse. Rose, by nature a gentle spirit, is angry and desperate to escape, so much so that she is about to commit suicide when she is saved by a young man, Jack, who, despite his shabby appearance, is a well-traveled, sensitive and upbeat artist who treats the troubled young lady with gentleness and respect and she responds. Their love for each other is instantaneous and unconditional and they are willing to die for each other. This is not such an implausible scenario and there is absolutely nothing immoral about their behavior. Rose willingly gives herself to Jack out of love for him, and even decades later still thinks of him as her one and only true love, the man who died for her so she could live. That is love. That is sacrifice. That is life. That is Christian. That they were not formally married is a mere technicality. Given the circumstances of their meeting. a loving and understanding G-d will forgive them. Now regarding the diamond that was given to Rose, instead of cashing it in like she could have, she kept it as a memento to her one true love. That is called character. Nothing unchristian about that. Indeed, the movie is actually about how Rose undergoes a complete transformation from a passive, unhappy, moody adolescent into a composed, mature, independent and beautiful woman, even changing her name, now prepared to go on to live a long and active life. That is, she experiences an epiphany. That is called personal growth which is quite Christian and most exemplary. As for Jack, he is with Rose in spirit and she lives her life accordingly, knowing that if it were not for him she would not have survived. Jack gave his life for Rose so she could live. That is powerfully compelling and completely consistent with Christian teachings.Maybe I shouldn't say this, but I will: I was waiting for the ship to sink because I was hoping that when the ship sank the movie would end ... but it didn't, and for that I was disappointed. To me, the story of the the Titanic is what happened to the ship, not some contrived, fictional, and highly improbable love story between a Little Miss Rich Girl and a Mr. Nice Guy Ne'er Do Well. The movie is weak for two reasons: First, the movie is asking me to believe that a young lady would dump her handsome, powerful, influential and above-all wealthy fiancé who has her mother's approval in favor of a no-account nobody who didn't even belong on the ship. Second, since we already know what's going to happen to the ship, much of the excitement is lost. Nevertheless, the portrayal of how the ship actually sank, and the resulting pandemonium, was effectively done. So if the movie had gotten rid of the love story and concentrated instead on how the passengers and crew coped with the impending sinking of the ship, that could have been the basis for an exceedingly dramatic story. But Hollywood being Hollywood, if the story doesn't include at least a smidgen of sex and a big dose of sentimentality, no matter how contrived, then that story won't be the one that makes it onto the screen, and this movie is proof of that statement. As further proof of that statement consider the final scene in which Little Miss Rich Girl, who's now something like 100 years old and a great-grandmother, tosses a multimillion-dollar diamond overboard in the name of love. Even for a movie that's unbelievable. It would have been better if she had used the diamond to pay for a salvaging operation to recover the divan on which she had posed nude for her boyfriend, Mr. Nobody, who, by sheer coincidence, also happened to be an accomplished artist. (Duh!) Now THAT would have made for a good story. The movie could have been entitled: ""The Titanic - The Story of a Woman and the Divan that Made Her Famous."" Now if somebody out there would like to advance me 50 or 100 million dollars to make this movie, then we'll be in business.",Titanic
86,dee.reid,Look at it for what it is and not for what it isn't,10,13 April 2002,"It has now been five years since ""Titanic"" was released into theaters and broke box office records by taking in more than $500 million worldwide (due largely to teenage girls). The story soon became familiar to everyone: poor boy Leonardo DiCaprio falls in love with rich girl Kate Winslet. ""Titanic"" won eleven out of fourteen Academy Award nominations, including best picture and best director: James Cameron. This movie made Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet box office stars. Leonardo DiCaprio became the biggest teen heartthrob since Corey Feldman while Kate Winslet became the hottest woman in Hollywood. This for me, was most evident when these two kids in my sixth grade class made a wallpaper (it was non-nude) of her on the teacher's computer. However, even with all the positive press this movie was getting, some people felt that ""Titanic"" was not all that it had been hyped up to be. Those people felt that ""Titanic"" was really nothing special, the acting especially that of Leonardo DiCaprio totally sucked, and some people claimed that the best part of this whole movie was when Kate Winslet stripped naked before having her youth immortalized as one of the girls in Jack's book. Even after hearing all of these negative comments about this film, I did not let them have an impact on my viewing of it. First, I think we all have to remember that this movie is coming from James Cameron, the man who brought us ""The Terminator"", ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"", produced ""Point Break"" and wrote ""Strange Days"", ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"", ""True Lies"", and TV's ""Dark Angel"". This movie made James Cameron probably one of the most successful directors in Hollywood. Even before ""Titanic,"" James Cameron had never ever really experienced that much success with any of his previous films.Second, look at this film for what is, which is a fictional love story in a historical setting, not a historical romance. Third, this is the most expensive movie Hollywood has ever made, costing $200 million to make. Director James Cameron risked his entire career as well as sinking Paramount studios into bankruptcy. It was a VERY, VERY big gamble that fortunately for James Cameron and Paramount studios, would pay off.Fourth, I'm a guy. I don't care to see Leonardo DiCaprio and I didn't watch this movie just to see Kate Winslet strip either, but I watched ""Titanic"" because I'm a fan of James Cameron and I have been since ""The Terminator"". Fifth, I know that this is one of those movies that when there is a wide range of comments about it, that it is best view it for yourself and then make your own judgment. That being said, I've watched ""Titanic"" at least ten times since 1998 and I still don't know whether or not I hate it or like it. But I give ""Titanic"" an eight out of ten based squarely on my own viewings and not popular opinion.",Titanic

88,runamokprods,"A triumph of Hollywood dazzle over an overblown, needlessly trumped up script.",7,4 January 2015,"There are a ton of problems in ""Titanic"" – the cartoon villains, the stilted dialog, much of it obviously re-recorded in post production. Some weak supporting performances, the betrayal of a number of historical facts, and taking what was already one of the most dramatic nights of the 20th century and needlessly pumping it up with chases, gunfire, theft, scheming, etc. Yet a lot works. As much as I didn't want to give in, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio make a great, old fashioned, star crossed romantic couple. Many of the effects and stunts are amazing (although at other times you realize some wide shots are basically giant video-game like cartoons). And it made me cry -- while I felt like a fool for being swept up in it's shameless melodrama. I can't argue that ""Titanic"" is art, or deep, or a great film, but I can say it's a terrifically effective entertainment that everyone should see at least once.",Titanic
89,CubsandCulture,Universal appeal,10,8 February 2019,"I think what I most admire about this film is how it is accessible to everyone. If you are interested in romance it has an earnest love triangle that is structured like a classic melodrama, i.e. Woman caught between the poor guy who represents liberation and the rich guy who represents safety. If you are interested in history it handles the Titanic story in a straight forward way and all the well known aspects are covered, i.e. The band playing during the sinking. If you are an action fan the actual sinking is quite impressive and engaging. If you are interested in cinematic techniques the film is a showcase of then cutting edge effects. And if you are so inclined to be snarky about any of that the film let's you be with relative ease. None of these threads really dominate the film and Cameron does a great job balancing all of them. I don't think everyone will like this film but I can't imagine how somehow would utterly hate it; it is harmless and there are so many worse films to slag on..For my money I rather enjoy the old fashioned spirit and how earnest the film is. Both because it is fun to be snarky about Jack and Rose. (JACK! ROSE!). But more often than not I rather get swept up in the melodrama. I utter aware of the writing issues and yet I still feel melancholy at the end of the film.On my last re-watch I was struck by how well the special effects have stood up over time. There are shots/effects here and there that no longer work fully but on the whole the film presents the sinking and the like in a very believable way. Cameron does a great job of mixing up the illusions to make it all work.Yes this is a middle brow film; but films that capture the industry's attention and the public's awe tend to be middlebrow.",Titanic

95,barnabyrudge,First half is slushy and unconvincing love story. Second half is an extraordinary and powerful sinking sequence.,7,7 January 2005,"Titanic is a staggeringly expensive and elegant love story, set against one of the most shocking maritime tragedies in history. Prior to its release, the media had their knives out for director James Cameron and were poised like vultures to cut him down to size. The budget had spiralled out-of-control, the film was scheduled with a running time of 3 hours, and everyone predicted a critical and financial disaster of unprecedented magnitude. As it turns out, Titanic is actually a good film. Not an excellent film, which many people seem to suggest, but definitely a good film. The second half in particular, which deals with the sinking of the ship and the chaos and panic that sweeps through the passengers, is very well made cinema.In the present, treasure hunters discover aboard the wreckage of the Titanic a drawing of a naked woman wearing a priceless diamond necklace. An old lady named Rose (Gloria Grahame) sees the drawing on the TV news. She calls in immediately, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. Rose is flown out to the dive centre in the Atlantic, where she narrates the story of how she came to be the subject of the drawing. She tells how a penniless American youth, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), won a ticket onto the Titanic during a card game in Southampton. She tells how she as a young woman (Kate Winslet) was travelling in first-class with her fiancée, banker Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), and how the two of them were unhappy in their relationship. Gradually, Jack - an aspiring artist - and Rose came together and began to fall in love. Then, the unthinkable happened and the Titanic hit an iceberg....For 90 minutes or so, Titanic almost lives down to the disastrous reputation that had been predicted of it before its release. It is a naive, slushy romantic story in which the love affair that develops is unconvincing and unbelievable. The characters of Rose, Jack and Cal are lifted straight from the pages of a Barbara Cartland-style, clichéd love-and-passion romance. But the film dramatically improves once the iceberg strikes. Cameron is into more comfortable territory at this point, showing his dazzling technical talents and his mastery of spectacle and excitement in a prolonged sinking sequence of true quality. The film suddenly becomes more purposeful and urgent, more exciting and moving. For upwards of an hour, we witness an authentic and harrowing event from a perspective of remarkable realism.Titanic eventually emerged as a phenomenally successful film, and recouped all its budgetary outlay plus a whole lot more. It also made the critics eat the words of their negative predictions. Yes, the opening stretch isn't up to much..... but the ship-sinking sequence more than compensates, and transforms this into a very commendable film.",Titanic

She sits down and recounts her memories of the journey that she had and the love that she found with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio)........oh yeah...........the ship sinks........I began watching the film determined not to cry but it all got too much and I started to well up as the credits started and the film began! Although, I think it's a good film, I feel I should mention the following points. Its way too long - scenes are drawn out and this had the effect of detaching me from the action and so lessening my emotional involvement. I thought that Kate Winslet as ""Rose"" and Leonardo DiCaprio were good in the lead roles but Kate was too much of a woman. She is meant to be a 16 year old. She was far too mature. This made Jack seem a bit too boyish for her, although his look is probably right considering that Kate is meant to be 16. Having said that, Winslet's facial expressions are very good and she draws you in to what she is feeling - she conveys the despair of the situation very well. She's also pretty good with an axe! I felt that DiCaprio was likable despite his constant optimism and the rest of the cast were good.Thank goodness that the Titanic sank and gave us such a wonderful tragedy.",Titanic

This was because he was very conceited, arrogant, and controlling of the woman he loved. Plus, he chased after Jack and Rose, attempting to kill them. If I were Rose, I would have told Cal that the wedding's off. Other than that, this film really touched me and made me feel good.

100,davispittman,A true James Cameron masterpiece,10,8 March 2015,"Titanic is for sure one of the most beloved films ever made, especially by the Academy in the year it came out. I believe it is very deserving of the many praises it has received over the years. i know there are people that claim it's terrible and i think it's mostly guys who roll their eyes at the romance involved. Ok so i think the acting from the very talented cast is well done. Winslet and DiCaprio are both doing their absolute best here, which is great because they really are two very gifted actors. i believe their love story because of the chemistry between them. I think the drawing scene and the car scene are both very beautifully done, handled well. The expressions on their faces portray real love and affection, but they both at the same time show a sense of vulnerability too. The other actors are very convincing as well, one that deserves praise is Kathy Bates, who plays Molly Brown. She had a great, believable energy about her, and she provides some fun comedic relief too. Gloria Stuart is so amazing here, she might be my favorite member of the cast, it may be a tie between her and DiCaprio because they're both so great. The visual effects in this film are just flat out incredible! They still hold up today and they are so realistic and breathtaking to watch. The soundtrack is great and I think it fits the film's tone. Overall, James Cameron knows what he's doing and he has people around him who also know what they're doing, so it results in a wildly entertaining, smart film, one that I will forever call a masterpiece.",Titanic

102,gcd70,Grand Production of an Amazing Tale,7,27 August 2008,"James Cameron has come of age in delivering this grand production of an amazing tale, one of the most fascinating true stories around. ""Titanic"" is every bit as good as everyone has been saying. You can see the three hundred million dollars up on the screen. Authenticity is second to none, as new footage is seamlessly faded in from old. Spectacular and awesome to say the least.All the facts and events are so fascinating you hardly need the human story provided. I certainly could have watched this as a documentary. James Cameron has left nothing to chance. I am hard pressed to imagine ""Titanic"" done better.The cast are all spot on and thoroughly enjoyable! Leonardo Di Caprio is the ideal devil-may-care Yankee who wins a ticket to sail to New York. Kate Winslett is perfect as the well-to-do little rich girl who hates her existence and Billy Zane is at his impressive best as the possessive fiancé who is heir to millions. The superlative support cast includes Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Johnathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Gloria Stuart and Suzy Amis.Grand, often haunting music is from Cameron regular James Horner. Editing is smart, and the film passes quickly though it is over three hours. The technical team have performed brilliantly, with computer graphics a particular treat. Set decoration (including a near to scale replica and incredibly intricate interiors) and Art Design are both amazing, recreating the most gallant ship of all with unerring grandeur and style. Cinematography sweeps through it all with panache.After viewing this, you'll feel you were there! Don't miss your chance to see this at the movies. I will certainly be boarding again!Saturday, February 28, 1998 - Village Sunshine Gold ClassIn an era basically void of epics, James Cameron has managed to produce a film that measures up with the likes of ""Ben Hur"". Grand, stylish, sweeping and larger than life is the best way to describe this astounding cinematic experience. I freely admit that I was one of the many cynics who, having heard of the film's monstrous budget, thought that ""Titanic"" would be the biggest flop of all time. I, like many, felt this 300 million dollar production would sink faster than the great ship herself.That was not the case, as history will now show, as ""Titanic"" has gone on to smash box office records, collecting a record equalling eleven Academy Awards along the way. The film's visuals alone justify this, with the ship of dreams brought fantastically back to life thanks to some awesome set design, huge scale replicas and access to the original blueprints. Mind blowing special effects, coupled with superior sound editing, make ""Titanic"" a must at the movies (preferably one with Digital Sound and a huge screen).Cameron brings it all together brilliantly, backed up as he is by a thoroughly enjoyable cast, including Leonardo Di Caprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton and Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown. Final master stroke comes from maestro James Horner, whose haunting, beautiful score is the spirit of ""Titanic"", which of course inspired the love theme (a song Jim Cameron never wanted originally) ""My Heart Will Go On"".Saturday, May 30, 1998 - Knox District CentreJim Cameron's grand film of the fateful ""Titanic"" and her maiden voyage loses a great deal of its impact if viewed on anything other than a huge screen. It is still a fascinating tale of how the ship of dreams went to the bottom of the Atlantic for all the wrong reasons.Forget about DiCaprio (miscast) and Winslet (charming), they are mere scenery in a fascinating true story. All those mistakes! Not enough life boats, which weren't filled anyway. Only one boat returning for survivors. Going full speed with virtually zero visibility, no binoculars on the lookout. People locked behind gates below deck, and a seaman who tried to round a giant iceberg in an enormous ship that ""doesn't turn worth a dime"". If the Titanic had've struck head on, it would have stayed afloat.Special effects, sets and costumes are all awesome, but you do really need that huge screen. James Horner's score is top stuff too.Saturday, January 2, 1999 - Video",Titanic
103,aharmas,Cameron Sets a New Standard for 3D Quality,10,4 April 2012,"15 years after this classic first hit, it's back, and now it looks and sounds better than ever, and some recent releases look so muddy and artificial in comparison. Here Cameron uses his expertise to improve on the technical aspects of ""Titanic"" without sacrificing what already worked. Nothing gratuitously calls attention to the new ""3D"" transfer. Instead, it enhances the gorgeous and meticulously produced movie. The spectacle glows with renewed strength, and each performance, each costume, each set now looks remarkable, all contributing what a true cinematic experience should be.As everyone knows, our stars are not reciting Shakespeare. The focus is on the relationship, and how two young people connect with each other. Surrounding them is cast of real and fictional character that gives us a little insight into what it was like being in the doomed ship. People look and act the part. Each class defined by the parameters of their own creation. Cameron understands the passengers on this ride. Zane, Bates, De Caprio and Winslet all do remarkable work, and it's still a question why De Caprio wasn't recognized by his peers when the film first came out. He is central to the success of this confection.In the end, the film, like the title will go on, having us choke on the emotional highs, the times when we understand what gives us humanity and hope, and when we see that humans share so much and are so far from perfect, but we just keep on going, and we will have dreams even after the worst of nightmares.It deserves repeated viewings and much praise. Thank you, Mr. Cameron.",Titanic

To me, Titanic presents a myriad of raw anger and spite. I could bash this movie for years. and my insults would never cease. From the improbable story line, to the putrid acting performance by Leo has made this movie a bane of existence.One would say I'm nothing but a bitter person, but such insinuations could be further from the truth. If I had enough guts, I would burn every last print in existence. No one is going to remember this film except for the fact they spent 20 bucks to buy a crummy movie which has spurned equally dull films of the same formula (the Green Mile, Pearl Harbor, and many more to come).I just have one big question for all of the idiots who voted for the Academy Awards for the year 1997. What were you thinking?!! How could you not choose L.A. Confidential or Good Will Hunting. Another reason why the Oscars will always disappoint me. I will say this: The Lord of the Rings opened on my birthday as well (hopefully, the curse is broken)",Titanic

I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book.  It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted.  I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that?  It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet.  I will gladly side with the majority this time around.

109,questl-18592,The Movie about people who make stupid choices and the ships that punish them,6,29 October 2021,"So, bit of backstory for me and this movie. When I was but a wee moviegoer my birthday came around and there were two big movies playing: Titanic and Flubber. At that age? I wanted to see Flubber, hands down, no question. We saw Titanic. Ever since then, I've had something of an unfair distaste for this one but recently I thought, ""It's been years, Cameron made it... I need to give it a fair chance.""Well, I can comfortably say that while I don't think it's for me, I was unfair to this as a child. It really lives up to the Cameron pedigree of being just absolutely gorgeous. The way he made that ship feel, the size of it, the grandeur is just the kind of master craft we come to expect of the man. The cast deliver solid performances throughout, there's a proper sense of drama, even though we all know how it's going to play out.Where it loses me is in the over-the-top nature of the love story. It feels like he's going for a Shakespearean, Romeo and Juliet type of romance epic and I just can't help but feel it's over the top. Beyond that, I could really do without the whole modern aspect of the story. I just feel like it slows stuff down and doesn't really bring anything to the story.Whelp, child me was wrong. This is a pretty solid movie, stunning to look at but is a little too cloying for my tastes still. I will no longer actively avoid it, won't flip the channel if it happens to be on. Can't say I'll be seeking it out again anytime soon, but who knows.",Titanic
110,Steffi_P,"""Life's a gift""",10,16 February 2012,"It's sometimes difficult to assess a movie that was such a phenomenon in its day. Titanic was a gigantic hit upon release, talked about everywhere, unavoidable. In parallel to its massive popularity there was also a backlash of people denouncing it as clichéd and overly sentimental, a lot of whom were probably deliberately disliking it because of its ubiquity. Now, it's of that awkward age where it's too recent to merit classic status, but too distant to still really be talked about much. As such its standing in posterity seems to be undecided, as yet.Historical romantic epics like this have long been around, and have long done well at box offices and awards ceremonies. And yes, they may be formulaic, but there is a certain craft in ticking all the boxes. Titanic works by bringing us in, with those opening scenes, with the position of a clinical observer of the wreck, as we might have seen it in books or documentaries. The framing narrative has a modern familiarity that we can relate to. We are then gradually eased back into the past, and the story of the ship and those who sailed aboard her becomes humanized. And I'm not just referring to the central love story. In writing his screenplay, James Cameron goes to lengths to pick hundreds of tiny strands, from the real fates of historical personages to brief flashes of unnamed figures. This broad, human retelling of a great disaster gives Titanic a wonderful richness, not to mention a deeper poignancy.Cameron was at this point best-known for his blockbusting actioners like Aliens and the Terminator movies, so as a director he might have seemed out of his depth on Titanic. But Cameron was always a professional, never a show-off, and he could handle weighty subjects with maturity. He doesn't faff about with the camera, usually keeping it still while all the movement is within the frame. And of course, when the movie turns more action-orientated during the ship's sinking, his experience puts him in good stead. The collision with the iceberg is so suspenseful that, every time I see it, I still hope the ship will turn in time. Throughout the movie there are a lot of point-of-view shots, more than most filmmakers dare to use these days, but the idea is to bring us close to the sensation of being there. But perhaps Cameron's greatest strength is his finding of an apt image to tell a story in an instant, from a man with his family frantically thumbing through a translation book to find his way off the ship, to Ismay's guilty face against the side of the ship as he is lowered down.The studio took a gamble in allowing Cameron to cast two lead players who were as young and inexperienced as Winslet and DiCaprio, but it paid off. Winslet is not a traditional beauty, but she has a vivacious personality that makes her attractive and instantly likable. At first glance DiCaprio seems to have been hired for his looks, but he proves to have a deep sincerity, such as the when he confronts Winslet and confesses his feelings towards her. And after all it's moments like this where a performance counts the most. But what really makes these two work is their believable youthfulness, and that eager rapport between them. Passionate love stories that take place over a day or two can easily seem a bit false, but Winslet and DiCaprio seem so great together the briefness of their affair is irrelevant.This diamond of a movie is not, I'll admit, without a few flaws. Despite the brilliant construction of the screenplay, the dialogue is woefully trite. The special effects are typically over-ambitious '90s CGI, with texture-less surfaces and too many fake people (although to be fair it still looks better than, say, a scale-model would). But whereas these problems would stick out like sore thumbs in a lesser picture, Titanic has such a grand sweep and emotional power that they become insignificant. I hope cinematic history will judge Titanic well, because regardless of hype and counter-hype, it really is everything a movie should be.",Titanic

112,pachara87,Jack and Rose actually cause the Titanic to hit the iceberg. Watch closely.,10,13 January 2019,"In retrospect, it's easy to be cynical and stuffy about James Cameron's 1997 Titanic. It surpassed previous champs Star Wars and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial as the top moneymaking film of all time (itself eventually surpassed by Cameron's Avatar), a personal affront to countless moviegoers over a certain age. With its record-tying 14 nominations and record-tying 11 wins, it turned members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences into a bunch of teenage fangirls (it wasn't until six years later, with The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, that AMPAS members turned into a bunch of teenage fanboys). It allowed Cameron, a genius as a filmmaker but an SOB as a human being (his ego's at least twice the size of the big boat itself), to become the self-proclaimed ""king of the world."" And it led to a lengthy period when it seemed as if Celine Dion's ubiquitous ""My Heart Will Go On"" was the only song ever recorded in American music history.But now it's time to go back to Titanic, which has been re-released to theaters not only in celebration of its 15th anniversary but, more soberly, only a few days removed from the precise 100th anniversary (April 15, 1912) of the disaster that snuffed out 1,500 lives. Cameron spared no expense for this re-launch, spending millions to convert the film into 3-D. Admittedly, most pictures that weren't originally filmed in that process but were only converted later as an excuse to boost ticket prices have failed to provide much extra oomph to the 2-D imagery (e.g. Clash of the Titans, Alice in Wonderland), but if there's one thing to be said about Cameron, the man knows how to derive the most technological bang for his buck. Titanic in 3-D looks fantastic, employing the format in a way that makes viewers feel as if they're the ones rounding a corridor corner or fighting to stay afloat in that icy Atlantic water.Fifteen years later, the highs and the lows still remain; luckily, what's good about the movie continues to easily outweigh its flaws. The fictional storyline is hoary in the extreme, relying on a ""wrong side of the tracks"" romance: Shortly after boarding the ship as it prepares to embark on its maiden voyage, poverty-stricken artist Jack Dawson spots socialite Rose DeWitt Bukater and instantly falls for her. In these career-propelling roles, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are excellent, delivering warm, winsome performances that provide their romance with an epic grandeur it certainly wouldn't have attained in less capable hands. The trouble, for both the young lovers and the audience members, is the presence of Rose's fiancé Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), a supercilious millionaire who would just as soon push the lower classes off the face of the earth as give them the time of day. As I watched Cal constantly berate the poor, expose his ignorance in wince-worthy dialogue (criticizing a painting by Picasso, he opines that the artist will never amount to anything), smack Rose around, and try to kill Jack by taking shots at him, I kept wondering why Cameron had elected to leave off a mustache that Zane could twirl at regular intervals - the character is even more cartoonish than actual cartoon character Snidely Whiplash.",Titanic
113,Spleen,A North Atlantic carp,7,6 September 1999,"First of all, `Titanic' was, on the whole and all things considered, a good movie.  There have been much sillier Best Picture awards handed out over the years.  I'll go through the basic drill as quickly as possible ...  Yes, the Titanic was HUGE - Titanic, as they say - and astounding to watch; yes, the musical score was intolerable, synthesised, neo-Celtic syrup; yes, Kate Winslet was gorgeous and, at one point, naked; yes, the story was pleasant, but pretty thin for three hours.  Have I covered everything?  Probably not, but I want to move on to complain about the very end.  The final few minutes contain footage that is just so manifestly stupid, so completely unnecessary, so obviously witless, that even if it's not enough to ruin the movie, James Cameron ought never be allowed to hear the end of it.  The trouble is that I can't lodge my complaint without giving some stuff away. So I feel obliged to issue aWARNINGto those people, wherever they may be, who have not yet seen `Titanic' - which I hope they will ignore.  Go on.  Have a peek.  It can't REALLY hurt you to know what you're in for.  It's not me, but James Cameron, who wants to lull you into quiescence for three hours and then hit you over the head with a big stupid mackerel.  -That said, I'll issue aSECOND WARNINGbefore getting down to business.My complaint is in two parts:(1)  A good deal of interest was supplied as we watched the diamond change hands throughout the movie, wondering where it would end up when the ship finally sank.  Well, it ends up - this is your last chance to stop reading - in Rose's hands.  She keeps it.  In fact she has it on her person seventy-something years later when she heads out into the Atlantic to meet the salvagers.  Then she wanders out to the railing one night and tosses it into the ocean.  WHY toss it into the ocean?  If she doesn't need the money, then the poor sods who invested heavily in order to find the diamond probably do - why not give THEM the diamond?  And what RIGHT does she have to effectively destroy this historical heirloom, former property of Louis XIV?  Clearly Cameron thought that, having made such heavy weather of the diamond early on, he needed to do something with it at the end, and he thought that throwing it into the sea would be very fine and dramatic. Dramatic fiddlesticks.(2)  Rose finally dies at a ripe old age and goes to a kind of heavenly Titanic where she is re-united with her true love, Jack.  But hang on. She's been married for several DECADES to some other bloke, who presumably has SOME claim on her affections in the afterlife.  I bet there'll be an awkward moment on the HMS Celestial Titanic when HE shows up.  But over-glorifying her (no doubt genuine) love for Jack is the least of it. Why the sudden dive into the supernatural?  One minute, we're in the material universe with the rest of the human race; the next, we're up in the sky somewhere.  I'm surprised they didn't give us a shot of Cal Hockley stoking the boilers in Hell.  (I've heard some people run the defence that this is all just a dream.  This strikes me as a strained interpretation; and even if it's the right interpretation, it's a poor defence.  Dreams are dramatically irrelevant.  At least, this one is.)These two complaints aren't trivial: they're illustrative of a more general problem.  The wondrous spectacle of `Titanic' is more than twice undercut by Cameron's facile theatrics.  Still - big ship, adolescent love, Kate Winslet, lots of water, and all that.",Titanic
114,Movie-ManDan,One of the Best Movies Ever Made. Haters have no idea.,10,21 October 2014,"At the time, Titanic was the most expensive and highest-grossing movie of all time. It was also the first movie since Ben-Hur in 1959 to win 11 Oscars, which is the most. Since then, Titanic has become one of the most polar-opposing movies, as well as the second biggest as of now. (Avatar in 2009 is to thank.) The lovers of this movie clearly outnumber the haters because this movie has high ratings on every site. Even so, I still think that it deserves to be ranked higher in every site. Higher than Pulp Fiction or Vertigo? Maybe not, but you get my point. There are flaws in this movie that keep it from being perfect. Number one is the whole subplot with the diamond necklace. Old Rose (who tells the story) still has the diamond and throws it in the ocean at the end because she feels that's where it belongs. Why not give it to a museum? Or feed a country? Then there is Jack and Rose's names being mentioned countless times. Some more dialogue is pretty dumb and there are no instances of any powerful dialogue. But considering how many upsides this movie has, these flaws do almost nothing to effect the quality of the film, because all the positives erase the negatives.The story of Titanic is pretty much Romeo and Juliet on a ship. Jack is a poor, charming artist. Rose is rich and mistreated who gets saved by Jack in every way. Romeo and Juliet is a story that many people find stupid because two young teenagers fall in love, then kill themselves after two days of knowing each other. Yes Jack and Rose fall in love quickly, but there are no dumb suicides, so Jack and Rose are smarter there. People also criticize Rose's character as being a rich, spoiled girl who gets anything she wants. I for one, can relate to Rose's character. She struggles to be perfect and is forced into and world where wealth is number one and is being forced to marry an abusive man who only want to marry her to inherit money. Nobody understands her. She feels trapped. I can relate to Rose's feelings by her becoming what she does not want. Then Jack comes along who finally understands her. He gives her the courage to be what she wants. Jack is sensitive, patient, and fun. Sounds gay? Leo DiCaprio is such a good actor that he makes Jack seem real and cool. This is one of Leo's biggest powerhouse performances that still shines. Maybe Jack and Rose fell in love quickly, but if the ship did not sink, would they have gotten married right away? No. Just date for a few months then break up. If Jack would have lived, would they have gotten married? Maybe. Jack risked his life for Rose, and they did all they could to survive. Since they were part of such a huge impact on each other's lives, maybe they would marry. Maybe not. Not just Jack and Rose, but everybody is developed so well, you feel like you grew up with them. Very few movies feature character development this deep. Then the ship hits the iceberg. Titanic movies have been made that have all turned out well, but none have been spectacular in the sinking portion. The danger is high, sets are great, sympathy is drawn, etc. Then there is the score, which is so beautiful and so sad. It adds so much to the littlest things.People, mainly men, that don't like this think that they're too cool for it. Anybody that doesn't like this just fails at trying to be cool. Too close-minded to see into and beyond a love-story and too close-minded to see how good the song and score were. Maybe this is a fake story, don't try to get all smart and say how the ship really did sink. The acting is extremely strong, characters are developed so well, the disaster scenes are played out excellently, the music is so haunting. Haters should continue watching NASCAR and Delta Force 2. 10/10.",Titanic
115,raulfaust,Collide With Destiny,8,28 April 2012,"After all the hype some friends of mine did about this movie and considering I saw only the last scenes a couple times, I did everything I could to get this movie on cinema. Sadly it stayed in my city for only 2 weeks and I could see it only today-- I had to go to a city 2 hours away from mine to catch this. In the first scenes I could see some cheesy lines and overacting-- mainly from DiCrapio and Paxton. After the first hour, the cheesy lines became less aggressive and I could stop remembering all the time that it is just a movie. The story is so well done that you feel inside the ship. They made a 3 hours plot so interesting and entertaining that you feel the movie just ended too fast. The relationship between the main couple-- although repeating the same old formula from Romeo and Juliet-- seems so realistic that we get jealous and want to have the same feeling they have. Unfortunately, it's not that easy to find someone you truly like in real life. One remarkable quote is when Jack says ""Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me""; you see, Jack was suffering with cold and about to die, but he still thought that dying would be worth it after the strong love they had-- which is, in my opinion, one of the most emotional lines in cinema history. Special effects are also quite good, some scenes are IMPOSSIBLE to explain how they've been built-- 3D or not. The story is all completely sad and painful to imagine, and you'll probably be very sad after seeing the whole picture, but will make you cherish your life even more. People can say whatever they like about ""Titanic"", but this is still a BEAUTIFUL movie to enjoy and comment with your friends for the rest of your life.

TitanicReviewed by Raven Devanney See her full review on video. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huGlaj1F_d0 Titanic is my favorite movie by far. This romantic masterpiece starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet tells a tale of love, loss and tragedy. I remember the first time I watched Titanic. I was 7 years old, and I've been hooked ever since. This was the first film that really made me cry, and even though I've seen it about a billion times, I still get choked up. This movie is beautifully done. I love that the cinematography is so grand and breathtaking even though the film came out in 1997. I especially love the way they capture the Titanic in all its glory. I'm a total history geek when it comes to the Titanic. I've seen every documentary and read every book there is to read about the Titanic, so the fact that they used actual footage of the wreckage of Titanic was really cool. My favorite characters are Rose and Jack, of course! They defy the rules of their different social statuses and are in true love. Not only are those characters great, but Kate and Leonardo do a masterful job in these roles. I love the whole movie, but my favorite scene would have to be when Rose and Jack are running through the ship away from the butler after the drawing scene. It lightens the mood of the film before the sinking and is quite funny. Plus, you almost get a mini tour of the ship. I also admire the final few scenes in which the ship is sinking. The way it is captured is amazing. It's the perfect mix of chaos and emotion, which really conveys the tragedy in a brilliant way. Like I said, this film is very tragic, and that fact that it was an actual event makes it even more sad. I would recommend this film for all ages, even though it is sad and slightly inappropriate. I watched it when I was 7 and nothing bothered me. This is a must-see movie, and I give it five out of five stars. I'd give it more if I could! Titanic is in stores now on DVD and Blu-ray, so be sure to add it to your home movie collection today!",Titanic

Some spoilers ahead.I recently re-watched this on video, on a small TV, and it still blew me away. Action fans will, of course, be disappointed. Perhaps this even qualifies as a chick-flick. I don't know, and don't care. It's just a great movie and never drags even at over three hours.I've tried hard to find niggles, to be impartial, but the only things I can point to are a couple of instances where the special effects were bad (at the beginning, where the bow of the sunken Titanic looks exactly like what it is....a model) and later where Jack and Rose are on the the foredeck and the camera is looking back toward the superstructure (where the scenery looks like the backdrop from a school play). Other than these, the story and effects are fantastic and enhance the film rather than overpowering it.I always cry at the end, with the old lady's scenes of returning to the ship. This is one of a very few movies that do make me cry. For that reason it will always be a favourite.",Titanic
119,screenman,Crass In The Extreme,3,12 December 2008,"First; let me say that the recreation of the RMS Titanic as a computer- generated entity is extremely well realised. If ever we needed proof that CGI can add an extra dimension to established technique and 'effects' when it's done with meticulous precision - here it is.But what about story? The Titanic contained over 1,500 human stories. Most of them were to end in terror on that fatal, freezing night.However, Mr Cameron decided that non of these were worth spit. They would serve simply as a desperate backdrop for two imaginary characters who might just as easily have been computer-generated themselves, so artificial, clichéd and crass were their presentation.Star-crossed young lovers projected against conflicting circumstances of the larger world have been a staple in human drama for as long as we have kept records. Perhaps the most famous example is Shakespeare's 'Romeo & Juliet'.What have we got here? Disaffected society girl meets, and finds redemption, in gallant working-class hero. Pass me the vomitarium, someone. She already has a beau; and he's as knavish as can be. In an early silent movie you can see him with a big bristly moustache and cruel leer, tying his victim to a railroad track. He's not going to be put down by a working-class oik. He'll resort to murder, if needs be. Cameron turns this Mack Sennett cliché on its head by casting the heroine as saviour. We see her wading waist-deep in the icy Atlantic waters without flinching from the cold (just you try it!), in earnest search for her manacled hero. Love isn't just blind - it's numb.But - hey; wait a minute! this is a romantic story from the old school. We can't let emancipation stand in the way of a damp hankie. The hero's got to do what a hero's got to do. Isn't that what males are bred for, after all? I mean; equality in pay is one thing, but equality in death? I don't think so. Oh-no; the male is always the more expendable. So, in the end we see him slowly freezing to death in the ocean whilst the heroine survives on a piece of flotsam. His duty done, his grip is relinquished, and he slips down to eternity. Whilst she gets to live another day and find a more durable schmuck. You can see that same scenario at the end of equally laughable 'Starship Troopers 2'. Yep; the hat's that old.And she might have to move pretty damn quick too. That passionate little dalliance in the coach could well have put a bun in the oven. It wouldn't do to have a child out of wedlock in 1912.Romance in the face of disaster became quite a fashion at this time, with other movies like 'Pearl Habour' playing much the same card. As I say; young romantic tragedy is a long-standing cultural staple in human story-telling. It just isn't usually so extremely crass and predictable as 'Titanic'.Tissues out or vomitarium at the ready, depending upon your gullibility quotient.",Titanic
120,moviewizguy,A Terrific Film!,10,17 February 2007,"This film is about Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich girl, and Jack Dawson, a poor boy who both fall in love on the ship, Titanic, in which it sank in 1912.This is a very wonderful film with great romance and peril. The special effects are terrific in the film. It's top notch with the action scenes and keeps the suspense going on the film. Well, that's the second half of the film.The first half is a great romance. We see Rose when she old (obviously, she survived) and she's telling the tale to ones who want to seek treasure in the ship. They don't believe her but as she tells the story, they do.I wasn't some of the millions who have seen this movie in the theater because I was practically five and there was no way that I would recognize this film. Now that I've finally seen the whole film, I've always seen the ending but never the whole movie, I loved it. I thought the first hour was going to be a waste because I don't imagine a film going 3 hours long unless the sinking occurs in the end but it occurred in the second half of the film.The acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great. they have great chemistry in the film and others like Billy Zane and Kathy Bates are good too.This is one of the best films ever. It has great action scenes and is a great tale of romance and should be seen by people who likes watching movies.",Titanic

The only thing I remember that I payed attention and really liked at that time was the Titanic sinking!*laugh* Well, 8 years have been passed, and now, more mature and having read about the real accident I can say that I enjoyed this movie very much. The romance between Jack(DiCaprio) and Rose(Winslet) is fictional, but make the movie be even more dramatic,since we have a chance of be closer of some people in the story. The way the movie begins, showing some people making the search of Titanic and even some shots of the ship forgot in the sea is very interesting and in the last scene, when the old Rose dies, it's a beautiful and symbolic scene to see her meeting again Jack and all the people that were killed in Titanic's disaster again.Ps:This is one of the movies that I saw Kate Winslet, and I found her astonishing!",Titanic

Director James Cameron delivers an example how a deep and perfect developed story takes your breath away with high emotional elements. It's not the usual love romance film but it has some of its magic moments. At the end I couldn't avoid tears in my eyes and wished really another end. Leonardo Di Caprio will remain for ever in my heart with the sweet soundtrack and I don't understand why he didn't get the Oscar for his outstanding performance. Anyway, Di Caprio counts no doubt as one of the best actors in the present. At least TITANIC won 11 Oscars and I am not surprised because everything is perfect. The scenery on the Titanic was wonderful done and the special effects were great. The DVD will take a great place in my best of DVD collection. My wife and me rate a solid 8/10. A must see for every cinema fan.",Titanic
123,mike48128,"A true classic-The ""GWTW"" of disaster movies",10,21 March 2016,"Best version since the old ""A Night to Remember"" (1953). With all those reviews, I only need to ""touch"" on the synopsis of the film. 101 year-old ""Rose"", long thought to have died in the disaster, reappears as the wreck is examined and it's contents rescued yet again. The ""explorer-scavenger"" is fascinated both with the story and romance of it all, but especially the recovery of the romantic 58 Caret heart-shaped diamond necklace known as ""The Heart of the Sea"" which is worth more than the Hope Diamond. Did such a gem exist, or is it the product of the screenwriter's vivid imagination? It is a well-told tale and the time passes so fast that it doesn't seem like a 3 hour movie at all. Superb cinematography combined with seamlessly beautiful special effects and the best shipwreck ever filmed. Models and the CGI are most convincing. The Oscar-winning musical score and audio are amazing. The ships motors and interior looks entirely authentic. Kathy Bates has a wonderful ""minor"" role as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown, and, as MGM used to say, ""a cast of ""more stars than there are in Heaven"". Billy Zane plays the deliciously mean and arrogant fiancée of 17-year-old ""Rose"",who is being forced to have pre-nupual sex, and marry a man she does not love, for his money. She hates it and is almost driven to suicide. One nude scene of a beautiful woman-child will offend only a minority of the viewing audience. (Rated PG-13. Also a few choice swear words.) Best ending ever (warning-huge spoiler) as ""Rose"" slips the huge blue diamond into the sea. The original DVD is letterboxed and not ""anamorphic"". Buy a later version, which is remastered for 16x9 TV. It is remastered to 1.78 format. I like to stop it around chapter 18 for an ""intermission"". I also highly recommend seeing ""Titanic-The Artifact Exhibit"" as a roadshow or Las Vegas attraction.",Titanic
124,mjw2305,As much a Love story as it is a Disaster movie,9,5 February 2005,"Most Disaster Movies have a love story that plods along amidst the action, but Titanic isn't one of them. The love story between Rose and Jack is very deep and involving, and is simply great to watch. At times it even distracts from the story of Titanic, yes, it's that compelling.The Good news for people who don't want the love story is this, the sinking of the Titanic is one of the best movies sequences in history, it truly does involve you in the horror of the disaster, and makes you realise how awful it must have been to have lived through it, or worse, to have failed to live through it.Many scenes in the film are deeply touching, but one that is imprinted on my mind is where a mother is reading a bedtime story to her children in 3rd class while the Titanic is sinking, the only way she can help them is to let them die peacefully in their sleep.The other wonderful thing about this movie, is the real life shots of Titanic at the bottom of the Ocean, the cinematographic is superb and it helps make it all more real.Worthy of its awards 9/10",Titanic
125,DeeNine-2,Grandiose schmaltz skillfully presented,8,28 January 2000,"This is much better than word of mouth led me to believe. Of course the script is corny and full of simplistic sentiment and it panders shamelessly to mid-brow sensitivities, and there's no question that the main intent is to jerk mass tears (but we could have guessed that from the subject). Still the photography is wonderful, Kate Winslet is captivating, and the plot clever. This is an old time Hollywood movie made not only to seduce the audience, but the Academy as well. And it succeeds. Billy Zane is perfectly one-dimensional and completely familiar as the conceited and selfish, immoral heir to a Gilded Age fortune. Kate Winslet as his intended is a ravishing beauty with oomph and a mind of her own. Leonardo DiCaprio as the wily and clever sketch artist who seduces her while twice saving her life comes across curiously as part Huck Finn and part John Boy. His romantic bravado in the freezing water saying he was so lucky to have won the steamship ticket because it allowed him to meet her was enough to embarrass even the most hardened Harlequin novelist.Most of the action before the bow scene was almost painful because just about every line was written so that a ten-year-old could understand what he was supposed to feel about whom. Evil, decadent rich people. Good, clever, hard working poor people. (They even party better.) Cliché followed cliché.But the romantic bow scene was artfully staged, and after that Kate came to life. It was strange to see her in the early scenes. She seemed almost a bad actress, as though the mediocrity of the direction had reduced her. But her part was so big and she had so much to do that her natural talent overcame the early junior high school text and the later schmaltz.Since the audience knows the ending, Director James Cameron knew he had a fine opportunity for dramatic irony, but his touch was a bit heavy handed, e.g., as they're boarding, a guy says, ""We're the luckiest sons of bitches in the world."" And since the audience knows eighty-five years of history unknown to the Titanic passengers, we get these further heavy bits of irony: On Picasso: ""He won't amount to a thing. Trust me."" And ""Freud, who is he?Is he a passenger?""My sensitivities were most offended, however, when Cameron has the savage crew smugly celebrate their good fortune before the safe they have hauled up is actually opened. That was the tip off for everybody in the audience to wisely know there would be little of value in the safe. Duh. In real life those guys don't celebrate until the gold is in the hand. Cameron's style is to flatter the audience, make them think they're smart, the usual pandering of a mediocre talent. Cameron even tries his hand at some cheap symbolism, i.e., mommie tells Rose that she must marry this suffocating and insufferable man because they need the money as she vigorously tightens Rose's confining corset.All right. Why did the Academy vote this best picture? Simply because it was a popular lavish production squarely in the Hollywood tradition, employing a whole bunch of movie folk, and it was a financial success, just what the industry craves. I should add that everything technical in the film was excellent, and Cameron's dramatic direction was a lot better than his dialogue. Also, because of the exquisite detail, watching the big ship sink was a whole lot of fun.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)",Titanic
126,DJAkin,I liked it but now I don't.,6,5 February 2002,"It's strange, I really liked this movie BEFORE Leonardo because famous.  Now that he's famous and hanging out at all the local hangouts in Hollywood and causing trouble, it's thwarted my opinion of his acting skills.  I will review this movie as if I saw it without knowing about Leo.  Ok, it was great.  I loved the scenes and the character portrayed by Billy Zane (who people say I look like) was perfectly evil.  I have seen lots of movies which involve love but this movie happened to really capture the intensity of love that exists between Kate Winslet and Leo.  I admit, the scene in the car was goofy.  But the scene in the dining room was splendid.  I hated the part where Leo screams that he's the king of the world.  Movies like this and Saving Private Ryan make us so much more interested in History.  I agree that this movie was good.  But heck, I just love history movies.  Three thumbs up!",Titanic

OK, so the two leads are acknowledged as being very good looking. Do these two points detract from the overall quality of the film? Not really.Being an aspiring screenwriter myself, I am usually the first to complain if the script is packed with corny lines. However, I class James Cameron as a maker of 'Event' movies, and for the purpose of big budget blockbusters all that really matters is that the script pushes all the right emotional buttons. This one does. Despite not being a consummate wordsmith, Jim knows how to manipulate an audience so that they're cryin' at the soppy parts and gaspin' at the thrilling bits. So, in that sense, any minor script faults don't really come into it.What people also forget is that both Leo & Kate are actually good performers. Before this, Kate cut her acting teeth in weighty period adaptations like ""Jude"", and Leo did a good job of bringing his interpretation of one of the Bard's classic characters to the big screen.This is, as I've said, an event movie, and they don't come much bigger in scale or scope.",Titanic

130,dunmore_ego,The King Of The World meets The Bitch Of The Sea.,7,27 May 2006,"Let's get one thing straight before we embark on this perilous journey into Hollywood History: the only ""truth"" in this movie is that the RMS Titanic did sink in April 1912 and that Leonardo DiCaprio is prettier than Kate Winslet. Everything else in James Cameron's *Titanic* is marshmallow fancy.Movie opens in the modern Atlantic, with a Titanic salvage crew helmed by amiable Brock Lovett (sun-weathered Bill Paxton), who haul surfaceward some intriguing artifacts. 84-year-old Rose (Gloria Stuart) claims she was a Titanic passenger, so is brought aboard Lovett's vessel to provide information.In a cheeky foreshadowing of the breath-hammering visuals to come, Lovett's crewmate outlines Titanic's death throes, aided by computer graphics (probably the selfsame graphics that the actual movie used as storyboard for its final visuals), before Lovett asks Rose for a firsthand account of the RMS Titanic and she, in a rheumy Percodan haze, starts relating a chick flick with Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.And under the chick flick, the film's main premise - a story of White Pride, sautéed in eleven million gallons of seawater.Rose's narration is the anomaly that eats at this film's verisimilitude: though we humor her spinning her tale of irrelevant romantic rhetoric, when it comes to events outside her sphere of experience (such as private meetings between the captain and crew), she relates them as if omniscient (if we are to regard all the film's action aboard Titanic as her testimony). Even the iceberg impact is comprehensively covered from all angles (from the lookouts, to the bridge, to the engine room, captain and crowd) by Rose's ""flashback."" Not bad for someone who was backseat bonking her body-shaved boy-man at the time.Rose laments that she ""doesn't even have a picture of Jack,"" her steerage-class lover (Leonardo DiCaprio). Maybe that's why she remembers him as so staggeringly beautiful.It's a pity that writer-director Cameron leaned so heavily on the vapid love story as this movie's propeller, as the rest of the film is a chest-clenching stunner.The grandeur of the Royal Mail Ship Titanic is beautifully captured in its restored filmic incarnation. Costuming, characters and exterior shots are paid the utmost detail  although it must be said that, historically at least, DiCaprio's character (Jack) was probably treading a time period more acquainted with the use of recreational drugs with his yells of ""Woooo!"" from the ship's prow. His friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci), didn't help with the authenticity; supplied by a casting agency specializing in Ethnic Stereotypes, Nucci is about as Italian as a Domino's Pizza, sporting the absolute worst ""Movie Italian"" accent of all time  the exact same accent my friends and I would adopt in the schoolyard when we were ""pretending to be Italian."" Winning their tickets in a card game, Jack and Fabrizio are overjoyed even in their steerage quarters Whilst above the water line, onto the first class decks desultorily rambles Rose (Kate Winslet) with her demanding mother (Frances Fisher), stormy fiancé (Billy Zane) and luggage enough to kill three pack-elephants. Elbow-gloved and triple-corseted, she remarks via voice-over, ""To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains."" Try telling that to an African-American, honey, in your big feathery hat and frothy bloomers.Meeting Jack during a spoiled brat suicide attempt, Rose is drawn to his vagabond swagger and hairless torso, falling for idiot lines like, ""You've got a fire inside you and I'd hate to see it go out."" (George Lucas wrote that one.) The film world does not communicate ""smell."" The super-privileged have a way of ""deodorizing"" themselves that is wholly alien to the super-poor. Hence, no matter how much prettier Jack is than Rose, as soon as she stood downwind of his below-decks stench, the romance would have come to an earthy halt (retching optional).Instead, Jack is invited to sup with the pinky-raisers, where he blathers about his itinerant lifestyle as if it was a blessing; living the devil-may-care bum's life of cobbling his sustenance from whatever rat-brained scheme comes along, and literally not knowing ""where he'll be sleeping the next night"" may be a romantic notion if you are a successful writer or an independently wealthy traveler  but not if you are, in fact, a REAL BUM.An ocean liner has to sink before Rose lets go of this vagrant (whilst staying in Spoiled Byoch character by selfishly hogging the one floating plank in all of the Atlantic).A well-made, mind-numbing romance this cheesy usually scores low  but Cameron gained his points purely due to his magnificent boat-tipping.The climax of *Titanic* is a startling visualization of an historic event which no one alive on earth today saw first hand. Drawing from the latest forensic knowledge, combined with the physics of the process, Cameron places us directly on deck during his nightmare vision. We see the situation mount, from berg impact and apathy, to incredulity and ultimately panic, capturing the violent and colossal majesty of the ship breaking in half and pulling its aft section downwards vertically.The death throes of the RMS Titanic are astounding in their realism; we cannot help but compare the final scenes of *A Night To Remember*, with its wholly inaccurate, romantic portrayal of the doomed passengers aboard that black-and-white Titanic singing nobly together as their ship slipped away under them at a 45 degree angle. Not only is collective humanity never that level-headed, the physics of the sinking process was entirely ignored.With humanity onboard Cameron's boat ignobly screaming and selfishly grasping and punching and shooting and falling violently onto propeller blades, with smokestacks crushing passengers, decks splintering, cables whiplashing through foaming brine, and the final cataclysmic submersion at a vertiginous ninety-degree angle, Cameron's *Titanic* is  titanic!If even for a brief, awe-inspiring moment in time, it's good to be the King of the World.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)",Titanic

132,frankde-jong,More than a doomed romance,8,24 April 2021,"Some time ago I watched ""A night to remember"" (1958, Roy Ward Baker), a film about the Titanic. This film was the direct cause to rewatch the ""ultimate"" Titanic movie of James Cameron.Both films tell of course the same story and share a number of comparable scenes (there is a you tube item where this comparison is acually made) and nonetheless the atmposhere is remarkably different. This difference is of course attributable to the romance between Rose (first class passenger played by Kate Winslet) and Jack (third class passenger played by Leonardo DiCaprio).Through this romance Cameron is able to sketch class distinctions well before the scenes in which third class passangers are denied access to the lifeboats. The distinction is most visible in the scenes in which Jack fist dines with Rose in the first class and Rose thereafter visits the dance evening in the third class.Cameron not only shows the distinction he also makes a value judgement. The first class passengers are (in majority) bad and hypocrite, the third class is on the contrary good, honest and full of life. This value judgement maybe somewhat generalising (for example the first class passenger Molly Brown (an excellent role of Kathy Bates) is rather sympathetic) but fits into the view in which the disaster with the Titanic is not just a ""traffic accident"" but symbolizes the decline of the 19th century class society and the end of the optimism at the start of the 20th century. In this symbolic view the iceberg stands for World War I.In some ways the romance between Jack and Rose is overdone. Especially Jack is too much a prince on too white a horse. In the aformentioned dinner scene he adapts remarkably well to the first class manners, while in the rest of the film Cameron stresses the unbridgeable gap between the classes. Apart from this Jack is also a capable artist, a sharp psychologist (he foresees what will happen if Rose stays with her rich but possessive fiancé) and last but not least he knows exactly how the Titanic will collapse.Not only Jack but also the spectator knows exactly how the Titanic will collapse. Earlier in the film it was explained to the old Rose (Gloria Stuart) by a member of an expedition to the wreck of the Titanic. The romance between Jack and Rose resulted in a nude portrait of Rose and the discovery of this nude portait in a safe on the Titanic enabled Cameron to frame the story as an intelligent flashback (old Rose telling her story to the members of the crew of the expedition).On second glance I realised how smart Cameron constructed his film. The romance between Jack and Rose as a vehicle to illustrate the class society. The explanation to old Rose about the collapse of the Titanic to also inform the spectator so that he can concentrate on the human drama in scenes to come. The use of the blue Danuba from Strauss (reminding of ""2001: A space odyssey"" (1968, Stanley Kubrick)) in the scene where the first class passengers elegantly walk towards their dining table. Only the computer animations of the overwiew shots of the Titanic slightly disappointed me. They were scarcely better than the 1953 overviews (or is that a compliment to ""A night to remember""? ).""Titanic"" has grown almost synonymous with Kate Winslet and Leonardi DiCaperio. Don't forget however the supporting actresses. Kathy Bates is superb as Molly, a nouveau riche who mercilessly exposes the hypocrisy of her fellow first class passengers. Gloria Stuart, who was 86 at that time and whose performances date back to ""The old dark house"" (1932, James Whale) is a perfect old Rose.",Titanic

I forgot how great and sad this film is. It has great characters that we come to love, and a powerful forbidden love storyline. In 1996, Brock Lovett and his team explore the Titanic wreckage in search for a necklace called the Heart of the Ocean. Instead, they find a nude drawing of a woman named Rose, who was wearing the necklace the night Titanic sank. Rose is now an elderly lady, and tells Brock and his team her story aboard the Titanic.In 1912, teen-aged Rose is a first-class passenger, and going to England with her fiancé Cal. Meanwhile, a drifter and artist named Jack Dawson wins a ticket aboard the Titanic. When Rose wants to commit suicide, Jack talks her out of it, and they soon start a relationship, defying Cal and her mom. Soon, Titanic hits the iceberg and slowly begins to sink.

A masterpiece in deed !!,10,16 April 2012,"Titanic was a heart-warming true story that touches the chord of your heart and feel sympathize for those thousands of innocent people killed in one of the most horrifying accident. A young aspiring painter meets a high class rich girl on the deck of Titanic and falls in love with her. Unfortunately , their love story is short lived as they face off the ill-fated disaster when their ship struck the iceberg and slowly sinks in the sea. Reviewing Titanic would be a little absurd for me as this one is a masterpiece by legendary director , James Cameron. I just came back after watching the 3D version of the film and I felt that I've seen the flick for the first time even though I've seen it 14 years back when it broke all the records in domestic as well in international circuits. I have always been an immense admirer for Cameron's work right from Terminator series till the visually enthralling Avatar. He not only gives his best shot but also works on the minute details to make his film a must watch. Similarly , he directed Titanic and gives a detailed level explanation of what really happened on the tragic night of 14th April , 1914. The screenplay and writing should be given full marks. The cinematography and art direction are grandeur giving a feeling of living Titanic through 194 mins. Background score by James Horner is so intriguing that it gels well with the mood of the film. Performances by Leanardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet is worth mentioning. They were young and relatively new when they did the film but I must tell you , they were superb. Overall , very emotional and heart-touching film in every sense that has re-written the history and will be immensely liked by people of all ages.

A love story about two young people from essentially opposite sides of life meeting on board the ill-fated ship RMS Titanic.Our cast includes Leonardo DiCaprio, who launched his career with this film. Academy Award nominee Kate Winslet, along with Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, David Warner, Billy Zane, and numerous others star in this expansive film that covers nearly every historical detail that is not part of the fictional love story. DiCaprio did very fine in his role, along with Winslet. Gloria Stuart was also very good in her role, though it was a small one.Like all love stories, the film includes romantic scenes which are in my opinion, some of the best produced in film history. We become emotionally attached to the two main characters as they struggle to hold onto each other through the huge disaster the Titanic makes its destructive collision against the iceberg.""Titanic"" made several achievements when it was released. It grossed over a billion dollars and is the highest grossing motion picture worldwide of all time. It also won eleven Academy Awards, one of only three films to do so. It launched the career of Leonard DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. And it is a very good love story. Unfortunately, it is also a movie that a large portion of the crowd hates. It's 7.0 rating on IMDb is unfair. True, it's a three-hour wait to the credits, but I never looked at my watch.",Titanic
139,baumer,Easily the best film of 97 and a classic that will stand the test of time,10,12 August 1999,"Warning: may be some small spoilers.I have always been a James Cameron fan. He is really one of the only directors I can say that has never made a bad film. Even his Piranha 2 was humorous and a fine effort coming from such a young director with a small budget. He has made, from what I can recall, two masterpieces (Aliens and Terminator 2) a genre pioneer (Terminator) and one of the best action movies to come out in the 90's ( True Lies ) and an ambitious touching film ( The Abyss ). But now he has outdone himself with Titanic. I don't think there has ever been a film that has taken me through such a wide array of emotions as this one. And that is all attributed to Cameron. He wrote, produced and directed this film. And it is one of the best films ever made.We all know the story of Titanic. A great ship sets sail for the U.S. from the U.K. and along the way it sinks and many people lost their lives in the Atlantic somewhere near Newfoundland. So there is no need to retell those events documentary style. A Night To Remember is there for that purpose. So what Cameron's Titanic does is tells the tale of fictitious characters blended in with real ones amidst the real events of the sinking. And it not only makes the film entertaining, it shows the sheer horror of what happened that night and makes you more sympathetic to the characters because you spend three hours with them. This is a brilliant, brilliant film.To start with, the actors are perfect. Not just DiCaprio and Winslet, but everyone from Zane and Bates right down to Paxton as the present day treasure hunter. But it is Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that are the true stars here as it the two of them that have to carry the load and make us care about them. And we do. We can feel them falling in love. We can feel the helpless emotions that Jack feels when he is trying to tell Rose that he loves her the day of the sinking. It is their relationship that is a great strength of the film.Next, what has to be mentioned is the score by James Horner. Very few times has a motion picture had a score that symbolized the sheer hopelessness and tragedy that is on screen. But here Horner has a perfect and somber piece of music that will bring tears to your eyes, especially when lives and love are lost.Also, the whole scope of the film is one of tragedy. It is a tragic love story, a tragic story of refugees trying to make a better life for themselves and have it all end abruptly with a giant piece of ice. It is a sad look at bureaucracy and wealth and how it can manipulate and control many things.But most importantly, this is a love story and an inspirational tearjerker. Rose and Jack fall fast and hard and it doesn't matter that they are from different worlds. Love sees no boundaries. If it is there, nothing can stop it. Not even death.Titanic is perfect in every sense. And as a guy, it is my duty not to cry in movies. I know how ridiculously old fashioned that sounds but it is true. We just aren't supposed to. But I left my testosterone at the door and when I finally let go, I found myself brought to tears as the scenes of children clinging for life in the frigid waters would be enough to bring the strongest man to tears. Cameron has manipulated us to perfection here and even if you find the romance to be embellished (which I don't) to watch this film and know that this happened, is a sad and disturbing reality. Few films have ever done this to me. Few have ever made me feel such a connection to the characters. Titanic does, and by the end of the film, you feel like you know the people of Titanic like they were your long lost relatives. And one final note: I can't understand how anyone could not enjoy the film, that's just me. But I know that what moves some does nothing for others. But the backlash towards this film is not necessary. Not every film has to be Ramboesque. Not every film has to be filled with explosions. I am not opposed to those films, I actually love many of them, but I am also prone to well written stories, whether they are love stories or not. Those who criticize this film need to realize that there is a market for this. The gross for this film and the demographics it appealed to confirm that.As for the comment made earlier about those of us that enjoyed it being teens and have never seen a film before 1990, well I am 27, my brother is 24, my mom is 50 something and my grandmother is in her 80's. And we all loved it. So keep that in mind. And a film does not gross 2 BILLION dollars by having only teens see it.This is as good as a film gets!One final note. The SE DVD finally came out and it was worth the wait. The transfer is beautiful and if you are like me and love DVD's so you can access the special features, then this disc is for you. The commentary alone by Cameron makes the disc worth spending your money on. Cameron doesn't do a lot of commentaries, but the ones he does are perhaps the most insightful commentaries out there. Titanic, he outdoes himself. I really recommend everyone who loves this film to get the SE DVD and just sti back for 3 hours and listen to what he has to say.",Titanic
140,kevin c,BOTTOM OF THE SEA,4,21 February 2000,"Yes it does entertain, and doesn't feel like 3 hours plus. However this film is pretty poor. Some of the lines like ""that Picasso will never amount to anything"", and ""i'm so lucky to be on the Titanic"" are crass beyond belief. Billy Zane is like a baddie out of a bad episode of Scooby-Doo. Why didn't the salvage crew tell the old dear to get on with it, and just tell them where the necklace was? Script over special effects please.",Titanic
141,PatrynXX,sometimes the illusion of a good movie is all that counts,9,7 September 1998,"First I'm gonna admit that for 4 months I was ranting about this movie from ocean to ocean.  Telling people that if you want to see a ship movie that is worth it, go see Das Boot.  Well April 19th I finally went to see the movie.  I went in thinking maybe 2 1/2 -3 star and came out emotionally spent.  I'm a guy and when a movie hits you that hard, I end up liking the movie so much.  What really made this movie worked was James Horner's score.  Only he could have done it.  I'm not one of those obsessed people who decided to see the movie 90 times (couldn't afford that even if I wanted to), I don't go out and buy the calendars, puzzles, shirts, diamonds related to the movie.  I do like reading about Titanic's history.  I like to take photographs, seeing old photographs makes the feeling the more real.   Contrary to many people, I think Kate Winslet is the star of the show and not Leo.  He's almost a non issue except that if not because of Leo, Kate would be wandering about God only know where or dead already. I hope Kate Winslet gets some movies worth her talent.  I know Leo's Man behind the Iron Mask was less than expected. So he's not perfect either. When I watch a movie I try very hard not to think about the politics of a movie.  Want a good way to ruin a movie, that's a good way how.  It's hard to believe that someone who completely hated the movie decided to see it. (which is dumb anyway. you can't complain until you see it, then you have every right to.)  This is only the second time since I began watching movies that my opinions about a movie have changed so dramatically.  The other was the highly controversial movie Last Temptation of Christ. (for which for over 5 years I refused to watch it.)  Well I better quiet down , and go back to reviewing movies just for friends..... it's a hobby of mine.. (this wasn't a true review anyway.  just defending against some of the comments I've seen so far on this page. thank you.)",Titanic
142,proud_luddite,A great film,9,20 December 2020,"This film mixes history (the sinking of the great ship in 1912) with fiction (a story of star-crossed young lovers on the ship: one, an artist with limited income; the other yearning to abandon the stuffiness of her upper-class background and a shallow fiancé).The 3-D re-release of this film was even more enjoyable the second time. The special effects are phenomenal. The scenes of the sinking ship are perfectly orchestrated and some images can't leave the mind such as the many bodies in the sea after the sinking. Seeing this film after 2001 is eerie; scenes of people jumping off the ship are reminiscent of the destruction of the World Trade Centre.The love story in the first half works well - mainly because of the fine work by actors Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Kathy Bates also makes the most of a small role.This is not to say the film is without flaws in the story. Did people really use the middle-finger gesture back in 1912? A rescue scene was perfectly directed but was also far-fetched. Also, the modern-day character who narrates the story in flashback fails to say what happened to one of her relatives.The story does well in exposing the injustices imposed by the upper-class whose descendants would be called ""the one per cent"" a century later. Their stuffiness is also exposed with good humour. But sometimes, the soullessness seems exaggerated.But these flaws don't dilute the great impact of this film. James Cameron's best work is in his directing rather than his writing. This is one of the rare big-budget Hollywood films of the past three decades that truly lives up to its expectations of greatness. - dbamateurcriticRating: 9 out of 10Award-Worth Achievements:

143,hall895,"Tragic tale, triumphant film",7,17 July 2014,"Titanic is now a film which people go out of their way to dismiss. Being contemptuous towards the film is the fashionable thing to do. Admitting you like the film marks you as being desperately uncool. Yes, the Titanic-mania of 1997-98 was a bit much. The box office records, the 11 Oscars...at some point people said enough was enough. But this is a film not so easily dismissed. Perhaps it was not worthy of the unprecedented frenzy which surrounded it. But it certainly does not deserve the derision it has received. It is a very solid film. A compelling story, beautiful visuals, stellar performances...this film has much to recommend it. James Cameron risked a lot to bring his vision of Titanic to the screen. The risks paid off. Titanic is great entertainment, truly captivating, at times legitimately thrilling. It's not a perfect movie, maybe it falls a touch short of true greatness but only by the thinnest of margins. All the hype, and all the eventual backlash, can't obscure the fact that this is indeed a very good movie.Of course this film is ultimately destined to turn tragic. But the film is not so much about the sinking of a ship. It is a love story. A very unique, heartwarming love story. A story about a young woman who found the love of her life. And found herself. All in the span of a few days aboard the ill-fated Titanic. Part of the film's charm is that this woman, Rose, tells us her story herself. 101 years old when we meet her Rose takes us back to the Titanic. And with her words she brings the great ship, and its passengers, back to life. One of those passengers is Cal, an arrogant man to whom, much to her chagrin, Rose is engaged. Her family needs Cal's money. Rose does not love him but family, and society, dictate she must marry this rather reprehensible man. But then things take a turn. Rose, in unusual and potentially embarrassing circumstances, meets Jack Dawson. While Rose enjoys first-class splendor Jack is a man from another world. A third-class passenger, no money to his name, no standing in society. Jack has no place in Rose's world. But, rather inevitably, Rose decides she wants a place in Jack's world. Yes, it is one of those scarcely believable stories in which a woman falls madly in love with a man she just met. But in her heart Rose knows. Jack is the one. She must follow her heart. She will throw away her privileged life to be with the man she loves. Unfortunately Cal is not going to give her up easily. But before this conflict can play itself out an iceberg intervenes.The love story of Rose and Jack is easy to embrace, especially when you contrast Jack, so good-hearted, with the vile Cal. Leonardo DiCaprio performs the role of Jack very well, making you believe there is so much more to this guy than is readily apparent. Jack is no ordinary third-class nobody and DiCaprio captures this unique individual wonderfully. But for as good as DiCaprio is it is Kate Winslet who is the real star here. Rose goes on an incredible journey of personal growth and Winslet nails it every step of the way. Rose is radiant, smart, witty and ultimately heroic. Winslet brings all those characteristics to the screen perfectly. Rose finds she is stronger, in so many ways, than she ever imagined. It takes a great actress to evolve along with such a character. And Winslet is clearly a great actress. For as good as DiCaprio and Winslet are in the two key roles the performance of Billy Zane as Cal, the main antagonist, leaves much to be desired. Zane takes Cal's villainy to cartoonish levels, by the end it's impossible to take the character seriously. Spitting his lines rather than speaking them Zane seems absolutely desperate for attention. Unfortunately the attention he brings upon himself is that of sticking out like a sore thumb in an otherwise stellar cast. Cal had to be evil to make the film's story work. But Zane overplays it so badly you half expect to find out that it was Cal who steered the ship into the iceberg and that he did it on purpose.Zane aside the rest of the supporting cast is excellent. While the lead characters are fictional there are many true-life figures aboard the ship. Some, such as ship builder Thomas Andrews, come across very well. Others, such as White Star Line managing director J. Bruce Ismay, do not. Whether those they portray are ultimately heroic, or quite the opposite, the cast by and large do an excellent job bringing these historical figures to life. And Cameron, with a great visual sense, beautiful sets, and state of the art effects, brings the ship to life. Titanic sails again. For the film to really work you had to believe you were really aboard a ship steaming across the Atlantic. Cameron makes it happen. We're right on board, right there with the passengers as they embrace the ship's majesty. And right there with them as the ship sinks to the bottom of the ocean. It is the love story which is at the heart of the film's success. But the sinking of the ship is spectacular, both haunting and thrilling. Perhaps the most fun sequence in the film comes when Rose wanders down to third-class where a raucous party is in full swing. We know that nearly all of those passengers are doomed. But Rose ensures they will not be forgotten. In telling us her story she tells us theirs as well. Through her Cameron has given a voice to all who were lost on that tragic night. Titanic is a film not without its flaws. But it is a film journey well worth taking. Three hours fly by as we follow the first, and last, journey of the great ship.",Titanic
144,Beta_Gallinger,"Not exactly worthy of all the hype upon its release in 1997, but passable",7,16 February 2009,"As I'm sure you know, this was a HUGE hit back when it was in theatres, turning out to be the highest grossing movie of all time, but as hard as it may be to believe, I've finally seen it for the first time, over eleven years later! I was eleven years old while the film was enjoying its box office success, and yes, I did hear a lot about the movie and how massive it was. I was also soon familiar with the famous song, ""My Heart Will Go On"", performed by the greatly despised Celine Dion. Still, I never actually saw the movie for over a decade. Shortly before finally watching it, I knew that despite its popularity, it has also been widely ridiculed. So, it wouldn't have surprised me if I wasn't very impressed at all, but that didn't exactly turn out to be the case.84 years after the sinking of the Titanic, a group of treasure hunters discover a drawing of a naked woman from the ship's wreckage. A TV report catches the attention of a woman around 101 years old named Rose Calvert, who contacts the treasure hunters to tell them that she is the one in that picture! She then goes with her granddaughter, Elizabeth, to visit the team. Although they are skeptical, the very elderly woman begins to tell them about her experience back in 1912, when she was Rose DeWitt Bukater, a rich teenager aboard the Titanic, believed to have gone down with the ship! She tells them how she began an unlikely romantic relationship with a poor young man on board named Jack Dawson after he saved her from a suicide attempt, and how this led to conflict between Rose and her family and oafish fiancée Caledon Hockley.Several months ago, I watched ""Pearl Harbour"", and it seemed that some people compared that film to ""Titanic"", which I thought was not good. As a result, I was expecting the same kind of poor dialogue and romance in this movie, the first of the two. Well, I definitely did find some fairly weak dialogue, and there definitely are flaws in the romance, so the film does have those things in common with its successor, but fortunately to a lesser degree. At least none of it made me laugh here, though it certainly does take some points off. Some of the performances here are also weak, including some of the actors who played the treasure hunters in the 90's parts of the film. When the acting isn't poor, it's basically average, for the most part at least. Oh well, at least I actually cared about what happened to the two main characters, even if they weren't portrayed as well as they could have been. I watched this movie on VHS, and due to its length, it was split onto two tapes. To tell you the truth, I was definitely more impressed with the content on the second tape than the content on the first. Without the climax (which I saw on the second video tape), I would be giving this movie a rating no higher than 6/10, but even that part isn't perfect.I know this is a widely loathed movie. I'm also no fan of the widely loathed Celine Dion, who performed the hit song for the film, and am not proud of the fact that she's from my country. (Mind you, I think ""My Heart Will Go On"" is the only song in her catalogue I've ever heard more than once, and I couldn't even name any of the others.) However, while it is severely flawed, and I wouldn't want to watch it multiple times, I think it could have been much worse. The climax is suspenseful, and before that, the film basically has some good and not so good moments. There may be some FAIRLY moving moments in this 1997 blockbuster, though nothing that even came close to having me in tears, unlike apparently many other viewers. It was also interesting for me seeing Gloria Stuart as 101-year-old Rose, since I had previously seen her in ""The Invisible Man"", which was made over sixty years before this film! Is this version of ""Titanic"" thoroughly inaccurate? I'm sure it is, so don't watch it if you want a realistic film based on historical fact. It's a fictional story about a romantic relationship between two fictional people. While it isn't worthy of its position as the highest grossing movie of all time, nor was it worthy of eleven Oscars, at least I think I can call it half-decent. I'm not sure what it would have been like watching this film without having seen ""Pearl Harbour"" first, but now that I've seen them both, I do think ""Titanic"" is pretty good in comparison.",Titanic
145,vip_ebriega,TITANIC has become one of my favorite films of the 90's.,10,24 February 2007,"My Take: An indisputably sweeping epic. A future classic? It should be.(This is an extension of the review I wrote in February 2007)Every so often, a magnificent epic would just take you away from all that and just sweep you by your feet. James Cameron's unbeatable, $200 million TITANIC is exactly that film, so it just upsets me why some people still don't get it.I was just wondering, it compelled me more than any other film I've seen for quite awhile (not to mention, it won 11 awards in the Oscars and scored high in the box-office), but why some people try to act cynical and bash this wonderful motion picture (This film is rated 7/10 here on IMDb? Come on!). ""Titanic"" is really that rare kind of masterpiece we don't usually find in today's film era. It wasn't just a big-budgeted film, it was a truly dramatic and touching tale with an old-fashioned romance that movies like CASABLANCA revolutionized. If movies like that are classics in a way TITANIC wanted to revisit, then may I ask what's wrong? The cast, headed by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, are superb. The direction and writing job by James Cameron is terrific (So is he just getting a hang of the love story thing? I think not!). But one of the real highlights is the superb score by James Horner, and the magnificent theme song. It has become one of my favorite all-time songs. The film too, has become one of my all-time favorites. Not only that, the film is also accurate on some of the facts. James Cameron really made sure to make it as realistic as possible. Like the sinking of the Titanic. Cameron really made that realistic (about the ship splitting in half before sinking). Anyway, combining such elements make it such a winner that won't insult you.I'm sure the movie is not without its imperfections, but when a movie's too good to be true, such elements don't come to you. It never did throughout the immense but utterly sweeping 194 minutes. It's entertainment at its best.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Titanic
146,rupie,redeemed only by the effects,4,22 April 1999,"It is a sad commentary on contemporary taste that this movie has received so much critical and popular acclaim. It is redeemed only by its admittedly spectacular special effects. The acting of diCaprio & Winslet is sophomoric. The romantic storyline is improbable and saccharine. The Billy Zane role harks back to the ridiculous mustachioed villains of 19th century melodrama - laughably unbelievable. The score is a disgrace; a movie which aspires so high deserves a symphony orchestra and a John Williams, not the synthesized tin whistle effort it received. The portrayal of social class (everyone in First Class is an evil, repressed, sneering Capitalist Oppressor while everyone in Steerage is a vibrant, life-affirming peasant saint) is right out of a Marxist primer. diCaprio teaching Winslet to spit over the rail is both ridiculous and disgusting. And as for Cameron's ballyhooed fetish for historical accuracy, there is absolutely no evidence that any ship's officer committed suicide during the sinking (but it sure works great on screen, doesn't it?!). Further, he neglects to give a name to the infamous ship that lay 10 miles away and watched the Titanic sink while doing nothing (it was the Californian). And this is the 90's so we have to have our obligatory and gratuitous nude scene and sex scene, don't we (can't make a film without one nowadays)? Those with an interest in the Titanic (possible as a result of this movie) are directed to Walter Lord's incomparable book on the disaster ""A Night to Remember"", and the 1958 J.Arthur Rank production of the same name. Although the effects are not as great (it's 1958 after all) they stand up well, and the script, acting and whole tone of the movie are superior to this bloated and overrated ""blockbuster"". And those who glibly call this ""the best movie of all time"" are gently advised to go out and rent one or more from the following list - ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""Spartacus"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""Citizen Kane"". ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""Patton"", ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Quiet Man""....",Titanic
147,Stampsfightclub,a dramatic and engaging love story,9,12 January 2008,"Kate Winslet (Eternal Sunshine of the spotless mind) stars as Rose, a young rich lady who travels on the Titanic, the boat which is destined to change human kind for ever as it sets sail in 1912. The story is told from an older Rose's point of view as she experiences life on the ""unsinkable ship"". Meeting Jack Dawson (Leo Di Caprio  Gangs of New York) this charming romantic tale brings out a heart-warming story of young love with an unmissable ending.Winner of 11 Oscars, David Cameron's Titanic is a wonderful tale of two young people who meet and begin to learn about life in different ways from one another. Winslet and Di Caprio are perfect as the two characters. From the wealthy and stubborn Rose to the relaxed and positive Jack, audiences can appreciate each character's different backgrounds and engage more into their lives. The characters are well developed in this film, giving the film more depth. Di Caprio and Winslet have good on screen chemistry making the film engaging and light hearted.Many critics have argued its predictability and its clichés but with a film like this, you have to look past them to the depth and control of the power of the characters and the surroundings in which they find themselves.The ending for me was really powerful and difficult to watch, I was close to tears.

148,Mister-6,"An antic, frantic ""Titanic""...",6,30 April 2000,"No doubt that James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is an epic story, told in grand fashion.  But let's get one thing straight right now.This is NOT a human interest piece.  This is a special effects piece.Look at all the Academy Awards it has won.  The majority of them in the technical arena, most logically.  If perhaps not the strongest in character motivation, Cameron is first and foremost a craftsman.  It's what he works best at (just look at the ""terminator"" films).  Every detail is lovingly placed and arranged with a perfectionist's eye and hand.  And the final half of the film (which I'll get to) is a masterpiece in itself.But as far as characterization goes, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio play their parts like good soldiers but are simply too shallow and unconvincing as the puppy-lovers caught up in the huge sweep of tragedy (a plot device as old as motion pictures themselves) to project much emotion or personality. Instead, they just walk around and say their lines as the rest of the movie goes on its merry way.Which is as it should be, I guess, as the movie does indeed have its own agenda and does its work very well, thank you.The final half of the movie is what everyone is interested in, anyway.  And Cameron and company acquit themselves very well as the Titanic slowly splits and sinks into the icy deep waters below.  Every single moment has its drama as the different passengers confront their mortality while the ship confronts its own.  Older couples comforting each other, parents holding their children tightly as the water rises around them, musicians valiantly playing hymns for the passengers, the doomed ship's designer calmly waiting by the fireplace as his creation collapses around him.  In this respect, ""Titanic"" deserves every award and accolade it has received, even more so.  No one modern director has worked so hard and emphatically on a vision as Cameron has here.  But as far as the human effort, he is the modern-day Hitchcock: herding his cast cattle-like from scene to scene, positioning them just so to emphasize the FX.But just consider the FX, and you'll understand.In view of the sight of the Titanic itself, that earns ten easy stars.  But subtract four stars for failing to find one cast member or character as interesting as the ship itself (no, not even Gloria Stuart.  Sorry, Gloria).In all, six stars for ""Titanic"".  Fast forward to when the iceberg makes its appearance and you may enjoy it even more.",Titanic
149,MuviFan73,Romance that did not sank with titanic!,9,24 September 2017,"The movie puts light on the romance that Jack and Rose shared.

It is just not about the emotions of the characters in the movie but the emotions of people who watch it as well.Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: I got to know about huge investment made in construction of sets, water bodies and their working.

151,TOMASBBloodhound,"Come on, admit it. This is a great film!",10,19 April 2003,"When you have a film this big and successful, it just stands to reason that a number of people are going to try to bash it. Especially when it happens to be a romance. And sure enough, I am the only male I know who has anything positive at all to say about it. Is all of the criticism warranted? Let's see...Jim Cameron didn't need to create this huge-scale, heavily detailed historical drama to prove to me he was a great director. This film did pretty much convince the rest of the movie-going world, though. We all know the story of this great luxury liner sinking to the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean on that chilly April evening in 1912. The substantial loss of life still ranks among the great human tragedies of recent history (9/11, Pearl Harbor, etc). Cameron spared no cost of either time or money to make the ship and its furnishings look exactly as they would have on that maiden voyage. In terms of technical detail, this film is without peer.
The cast is generally appealing. Leo DiCaprio is far from a world-class actor, but his enthusiastic and earnest portrayal of Jack Dawson couldn't have been done better. Kate Winslet looks right in her element as a pampered young debutant trying to brake away from her boring life consisting of endless dinners and tea parties. Kathy Bates as ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"" is always likeable and the rest of the cast (mostly Brits) does a good job of filling out their respective roles of cast and crew. Billy Zane gives the film's best performance as Winslet's greedy, snobbish fiancee. He is one of our most underrated actors. And you have to love David Warner as his bodyguard/enforcer.   As far as the special effects go, it's hard to imagine the sinking of the ship could have been filmed any better. Each time you view it, you seem to get a different perspective of just how lucky any of those passengers were to survive not only the actual sinking, but waiting around in life boats for help to arrive. As of this writing, only three known survivors are still alive. One can only imagine how many countless hours it took to conceive of, shoot, and edit the last hour of the film. The results are terrific.There are flaws in the overall mix, however. Some of the dialogue (Mostly Leo's) is down right corny. ""When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose!"" or ""You seem like kind of an indoor girl"" are two examples. Also, the notion that a guy from steerage class could go up and mingle with the first class passengers under any circumstances is not plausable. Keep in mind that a first class ticket on Titanic in today's economy would go for $80,000! These were some RICH people, and they wouldn't have let a guy like Dawson near them.Anyone who watches this film will have to endure numerous scenes of sappy romance. This film is a romance above all else. Just tough it out if it bothers you. It's not that bad.This film is tragic, exciting, sensual, pretentious, corny, extravagant, and even a little cheesy. And I love EVERY DAMN MINUTE OF IT!!!!!!!!5 of 5 stars.So sayeth the Hound.",Titanic

The poor boy is a talented artist who has spent time sketching naked harlots in Gay Paree, lol. Rich girl strips her clothes off and poses for boy artist. Nasty fiancé goes gunning for poor boy. Puppy dog valet/hit-man for fiancé does some really goofy chasing down the ship for poor artist boy.As an OSU history major, I feel, in all seriousness:I know this story was fictional, and that the real story was tragic and ugly. Sometimes I think the supposed disaster was a real set-up and early harbinger of World War I. Perhaps the ship designers and certain cruise line executives were in cahoots with the evil perpetrators of the war. The war started in Europe in 1914, two years after the Titanic disaster. Not just a coincidence. German leaders had been arguing among themselves for decades leading up to the war, and perhaps they figured that a disaster really embarrassing the British and Americans would be a real coup in their attempt to conquer the world.Maybe the Germans were investors in White Star, and wanted the insurance money to fund their growing war. Wars do cost lots of money, and Germany as a united nation began in 1871, only about 40 years earlier. Young nations don't have a lot of money to fund such endeavors.There are no accidents, according to philosophical theory. Germany had been in unrest all during the early part of the 20th Century -- events leading up to World War I. Another close-in-time famous ship disaster was 1915: the Lusitania, hit-destroyed-sunk by German U-boats (armed with torpedoes) who had warned that ship not to be caught in its shipping lanes. Lots of famous and important people were aboard the Lusitania, and also lots of rich-and-famous were aboard the Titanic. Even the ships' names are rather alike.The chilling part is that it is now almost 2012 -- 100 years after the fatal Titanic disaster. Now, in 2007, 2012 is five years away. All things come back around, and I imagine there will be some sort of commemorative remembrances regarding the Titanic in 2012. Why has this 'accident' been called the most famous ship disaster in history? Why are all those movies (and even a Broadway musical) made of this unfortunate loss of life and wealthy property?Titanic: How could such a magnificent ship suddenly crack up like so much balsa wood? I feel there was lots of sabotage and manipulation. I hope that there were real first-love stories aboard this ship, as suggested in this movie.The Queen of the Sea was supposed to be bigger, stronger, better, and much more well-built than all other ships of its day, not to mention ultra-luxurious and mega-speedy. Its riveting was world-class, and its workmanship unparalleled. Nay, not an accident, but perhaps, and only perhaps, a ""red herring"" to take the world's attention away from the growing Teutonic holocaust in Europe.",Titanic
153,Hollywood_Yoda,"""James Cameron's TITANIC""",8,17 May 2010,"In this, James Cameron's first masterpiece, we see the Titanic like never before, romanticized, with a love story to boot! When released in 1997, Titanic was expected to be a financial flop for Paramount and Fox studios, who had put up a record amount of production money, only to wind up with the highest grossing film of all time. A record that was kept for twelve years, until Cameron's next film, 'Avatar' outsold Titanic's ticket sales in 2009. We find Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet and Billy Zane in a love triangle to trump all love triangles prior! The film, although partially based on actual events and made up people, was a hit with audiences in the summer of 1997, breaking box office records from start to finish. A great cast and great direction, along with the most up-to date special effects of the time make for a splendid experience, 8/10.",Titanic

Go write it on a wall.Titanic isn't even in the Top250....how is that possible?Oh, I get it...Titanic is the highest grossing movie of all-time, so that's why you hate it. Haters hate. It's what they do. We understand. We know what's really going on with all you haters.Shouldn't you have to answer a few questions before you are able to submit a review, so to prove that you have some remnant of a functioning brain. You disgrace the filmmakers so bad.It really isn't that hard to make a consensus list of the best movies; well it is when a monkey is allowed to write a review.Here's what I'm saying, if you call Titanic anything other than an absolute masterpiece, you are just wrong.

155,The_Movie_Cat,"""Of course, the experience of it was somewhat different.""",6,26 December 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS
This is one of the most realistic films I've ever seen, a modern day classic that allows for drama by having the lead character tell the tale in flashback, letting you know she lives till the end. This framing sequence neatly comes back three times, and we get a voiceover, cannily breaking up the narrative.It turns out the elderly lady was Kate Winslet, a rich society girl engaged to the boo-hiss pantomime villain played by Billy Zane. Well, he is English, after all. Anyway, this upper class madam soon falls for a cocky brat with a head shaped like a turnip, and starts performing activities generic of her class. Like spitting over the side of the ship and getting her boobs out. I did give the movie 8/10, but that was for Kate's mighty chest, rather than the film itself. Mind you, it's all quite understandable as Jack has an enticing line in fortune-cookie platitudes, spouting lines like: ""When you got nuthin', you got nuthin' to lose"" and ""Make each day count.""Where it really succeeds is in its accessibility, like many Cameron movies. Rather than confusing the issue with all that characterisation nonsense, we have dialogue that is functional and neat stereotypes like the Irish crew that love to do nothing more than dance a merry jig. Whuy, it be straight out o' a advert four de Morphees. And just like it, they're not bitter. Well, they're the US's spiritual kinfolk, aren't they? Even the Scots and Welsh help a little bit, but the English can't wait to shoot the passengers. And only the Americans are truly heroic.Perhaps the stumbling block is the superb realisation of the ship itself. To correct this error, Cameron gives us some ropy CGI, from the background where Rose attempts suicide, to the iceberg, which is as two dimensional as Billy Zane's character. Apparently the cheap effects came about because, despite costing $200 million to make, over half went on Zane's mascara. Ooo, he's a real villain, he is! Another wrong foot is casting the RSC Jonathan Hyde. The thought of having a decent actor in the film is absolutely abhorrent, yet luckily it's not a mistake the director makes twice.But the masterstroke is the running time. Where a 90 or 120 minutes duration might feel just about right, Cameron drags it out to over three hours. Genius. Other great moments include the constant references to the ship not being able to sink, and the cod English accents. Any old director worth his salt could cast realistic accents, but giving it a touch of the Van Dykes is a feat of remarkable post-modernism. In fact, the only thing the film needed to take it to the very peak of perfection was a dreary love ballad at the end by Celine Dion. Oh dear.",Titanic
156,SmileysWorld,Excellent blend of a fictional love story and real life tragedy,9,2 October 2001,"I think that,as movie watchers,we all have at least one film that we wanted to like so much, that a disappointment would just be too much to handle.One such film for me was Titanic.Thankfully, it did not let me down,although the movie is not without it's imperfections.I'll talk about the great things first.Never has the ship been more masterfully recreated.I guess it took all this time to have the technology to do so.The special effects are indeed the best I have seen in any film.As for the acting, Billy Zane really steals the show from our two heroes,Leo and Kate,as the greedy,relentless Cal Hockley.Zane's performance is one of the better I have seen when it comes to villains.The recreation of the ship's final moments is spellbinding.The moment that touched my heart the most would have to be the ""Nearer My God to Thee"" scene.You are not human if this moment does not touch you to some degree.The only complaint I have with this film is the use of humor in some questionable places,For example,as Rose is battling to free Jack from his handcuffs and rescue him from certain doom,he utters the line,""I'll wait right here"".I certainly don't think one liners would be appropriate in that situation,though some may disagree.Overall, this film is a great blend of fiction and real life,and if you can sit still for three hours,I definitely recommend it.",Titanic
157,Anurag-Shetty,"Undoubtedly the best movie of the century! A triumph, in all aspects!",10,19 April 2012,"Titanic, is a fictional take on the tragic maiden voyage of the RMS Titanic. The events of the ill fated journey of the ship is told in the midst of a beautiful love story between two people of differing social backgrounds & how they overcome all odds to be together. Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio), is a man who boarded the Titanic by chance. It was a gamble which had a third class ticket to the Titanic at stake. Rose DeWitt Bukater(Kate Winslet) is a woman of the royal family. She is one of the first few people who got a first class ticket for the very first voyage of the Titanic, along with other famous, wealthy & important people. So it was fate & fate alone, that brought Jack & Rose together. This is the synopsis of the movie.This is my review of the new 3D version of Titanic that released in 2012. First off, what a beautiful story. Sure, it's predictable, but, the way in which it's written ensures that you don't get bored even for a single second. The way that Jack & Rose fall in love is one of the highlights of the movie. Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet share great chemistry together. Not to mention, that they've acted brilliantly! Both Oscar worthy performances. Unfortunately, only Kate Winslet won the award for best actress. The supporting characters are impressive as well. The way they've shown how the ship first hits the iceberg, starts flooding, tilts at a 180 degree angle & finally snaps into two makes the movie. All this looks even better in 3D! The best conversion from 2D to 3D ever! So, grab your 3D glasses, popcorn & soft drink & be prepared to witness a once in a lifetime experience all over again! James Cameron, take a bow! A must watch!",Titanic

159,aesgaard41,"Reminds Me of an Episode of ""Quantum Leap""",10,27 January 2001,"Voice of Dean Stockwell as Admiral Al Calavicci: ""Sam, Ziggy says you've leapt into one Jack Dawson of Chippewa Falls,Michigan and that there's a 78.5% chance that you're here to save the life of one Rose Dewitt Bukater."" Well, at least that's the way I see it. I may not see Scott Bakula or Stockwell, but for some reason I get the feeling that behind DeCaprio's pretty boy looks, it is Bakula as time-traveler Sam Beckett pulling his strings. I can just hear Stockwell after the nude drawing: ""You drew that while she was.....And I missed it?! Rats!!"" Back to the movie, it may be a chick flick for girls to see Leo, but it does have Kate Winslet for the guys. She looks incredible with red hair! Billy Zane should get an award for the sheer arrogance he plays (maybe it comes naturally) and David Warner should get the Jerk Reward for his portrayal as Zane's stooge. Exceptionally talented Kathy Bates is wonderfully likeable as Molly Brown, a far cry from her ""Misery"" role, but then she does excellant work in everything she does. Cameron pays a lot of detail into this work, or not considering the bloopers constantly being nick-picked. The story of two lovers separated by fate works well against the tragedy of the Titanic's sinking as does telling it from a past point of view at the site of a salvage expedition with Bill Paxton. I haven't seen him since ""Wierd Science."" The sinking is very well done. We just don't see a miniature sinking as have we seen in so many other movies, we see the drowning, the suffering, the deck going up, the sheer terror and true nature of the human spirit when faced with its mortality, the people fighting for life boats......this is the movie to put an end to further Titanic movies. Cameron has put together here not just an incredibly powerful movie, but a chick flick that even guys would want to see!",Titanic
160,agmoldham,Biggest Grossing Movie of all time,6,25 April 2004,"Whatever people think about this film it certainly had the magic ingredients at the box office. Even after all the Potter and Rings movies it's still grossed nearly twice as much as any other film.I can't imagine many people on the planet don't know what happened to the Titanic. The story is set around the unlikely romance between Jack and Rose. The film is pretty much split into two halves. The first is the romance between Jack and Rose, whilst the second is all about the boat going down. The effects are still very impressive and Leo and Kate look nice enough. Maybe it's not quite deserving of the Oscar glory and box office, but it's still a fairly entertaining movie. 8/10",Titanic

162,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Not exactly excellent, but a beautifully moving and epic film",8,30 September 2012,"Back at the 90s when I was a little child, I loved all of the films that came out at the time, but I never heard of James Cameron before until at 2009, when that guy made his sci-fi epic ""Avatar"", I saw it and loved it as much as anyone else despite it's flawed story (loved the concept, by the way) and considered one of the best movies James Cameron has ever made since the first two Terminator movies (I've watched them and I thought they were completely epic) and Aliens. So, I decided to watch this on a VHS copy that I used to have until it vanished and I was officially moved by it.Before I could get to the positive aspects, I've heard some criticisms from other people who said that this is an extremely overlong and overrated film. Well, I will admit that this film does have some flaws, they're outweighed by it's redeeming qualities. The three hour length is longer, but I was impressed at how the it moves very quickly and the script, while staying true to the tragedy of the ship, has it's cheesy moments. The film looks very pretty and the look of the ship is beautiful. It also has some gorgeous costumes and very solid special effects. The music from James Horner is lovely and is one of his best scores in a feature film so far especially the heart-rendering song ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion and is one of the best music songs in cinema history.The direction from James Cameron is amazing and helps the story with complete focus while giving a intriguing atmosphere to it. The story is very rich in detail, gives the characters a lot of development perfectly and the love story, while obvious, is really moving. The strongest aspects, however, goes to the climax of the movie for has drama, heart, and comedy perfectly mixed together and a flawless cast to make the characters more interesting, emotive, and likable. Leonardo Di Caprio gives out one of his best performances as Jack Dawson, Kate Winslet is lovely as Rose, and Billy Zane is a great villain due to his deliciously cartoony and over-the-top performance. Other actors like Kathy Bates, Jonathan Hyde, Victor Garber, Bernard Hill, and more did well with their roles and the character development along with their interactions with the main characters were amazing.Overall, Titanic isn't nearly as excellent as James Cameron's previous films, but this is a beautifully moving and a 15-year old epic film that will always be recommended to others as one of the best movies ever made in cinema. With all my heart, this deserves a thumbs up from me.",Titanic
163,Jack the Ripper1888,Not quite so popular anymore.,10,8 December 2002,"Thought to be the most popular motion picture of all time by many, this film is probably also the most hated. Director James Cameron created an epic disaster story combined with a sloppily put together love story on the ill-fated, ""unsinkable"" R.M.S. Titanic. We all knew the story of TITANIC, so why did we all bother to go see it? We were curious about the events leading up to the disaster and I'm sure there were many who were interested in seeing the stupid love story.James Cameron wanted to make a love story. He said so himself. But, what he should have done was create a love story, and only a love story. But, no, he decided to combine his romance tale with the tragic story of Titanic. As soon as the iceberg hits, the story becomes just like an action-adventure movie with a little bit of love thrown in. And Cameron also dragged his stupid romance out for almost two hours before the real reason people went to see this movie happened. We all wanted a great movie about the story of Titanic, not a love story. How this film garnered so many damn Academy Awards is beyond me. I mean, a couple would have been understandable, but TITANIC won almost ALL of the awards, and I ain't kidding when I say 'all'.The cast was also all-star: Leonardo DiCaprio (if I was Cameron, I would have gotten someone else to play that part, as no one likes DiCaprio--this probably discouraged many people from seeing this film), Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, David Warner, Victor Garber, Bill Paxton, Danny Nucci,Jonathan Hyde, Bernard Fox and Jason Barrey lead the way in probably the biggest hit of all time...and the biggest flop.

164,Atreyu_II,"The ""unsinkable"" ship that was destined to sink",6,12 July 2007,"""Titanic"" is not only the most famous disaster film of all time, but also one of the most popular movies ever, not to mention that it achieved the rare glory of wining 11 Academy Oscars. Many ""Titanic"" films were made during the 20th century, but the famous James Cameron film from 1997 is the most well known.This film version of the legendary ship was a phenomenal and unusual success, so much that it was something like 7 months on theaters and proved to be the most cost-effective movie ever made. Many people even went to the theaters twice to see it. And the number of Academy Oscars that it won is another prove of its success. Plus, most everyone praised and liked the film back then. It was a hit on VHS and DVD as well.Strangely, in recent years the movie has been getting many lukewarm reviews and I read somewhere in the Internet that it was considered the worst Oscar winner ever. How ironic, huh? It seems that it has become fashionable to hate this movie.It's an okay movie, but not all that great. However, my biggest problem with the movie was always its length. 3 hours is too much and becomes tiring, even exhausting.The story is well known for being based in a real disaster story which happened in 1912. That makes this a realistic movie. The ship's replica is very well made and detailed. In that way they achieved perfection, making it look just like the real ship, which was the biggest, fastest, most luxurious and most beautiful of its time. Sadly it hit an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage and more than half of the people passed away. You know what bothers me most? First, the number of lifeboats wasn't enough because, stupidly, they believed that more lifeboats would be a waste of space in an ""unsinkable"" ship. Unsinkable? Yeah, right... Second, the ship was going too fast when its engines hadn't been tested enough... and all of this just because of headlines!""Titanic"" has beautiful instrumental music, a beautiful ballad named ""My Heart Will Go On"" sung by Celine Dion, beautiful angles of view of that pretty ship, romance, tension, suspense and incredibly tragic moments. To see people falling in despair and committing suicide is a reality and it certainly happened in real life. This movie also contains some nudity and sex and even some shocking and controversial scenes of homicide. However, it's not just a melodrama. It has also romance and even some moments of comedy.Besides, to see the Titanic sinking, breaking in two and to see its rear at an impressing height is breathtaking. It will live forever in your mind because it's very impressive. Spectacular, yes, but tragic.The actors do a good job in their roles: Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Victor Garber, Danny Nucci, Jason Barry, Bernard Fox and others...By the way, Mr. Andrews, Jack Dawson, Fabrizio and Tommy Ryan are the best and nicest characters of this movie.Another equally revolutionary ship was the french ocean liner SS Normandie in the 30's. Its appearance was very similar to the RMS Titanic and inside it followed the same concept of luxury in a classic and old fashioned style, very different from the luxury standards of modern liners. The SS Normandie didn't sink, but its ending was tragic too. During the World War II, it was was converted to a troopship in 1942, caught fire, capsized and sank at the New York Passenger Ship Terminal. Although it was salvaged at great expense, restoration of the vessel was deemed too expensive, so it was scrapped in 1946. And I say ""it"" because I don't like to refer to the ships as ""she"".",Titanic

For me, the best part of the film, I must admit, it's when the ship go down under!

167,Tito-8,Outstanding,10,13 June 1999,"The first half of this movie focused on a romance that I did not care about, and yet, I was still somehow engrossed by it all.  Rationally, I can understand that the story was fairly ordinary, but somehow, I was riveted. This is something that I cannot explain.  For every scene after the iceberg is first spotted, however, I can fully understand why I loved this movie so much.  The action scenes in this film are absolutely jaw-dropping, and this fact is the primary reason why this is one of my favorite films.  However, I can certainly agree with those who found this to be a real tearjerker. Seeing so many innocent people preparing to die is heartbreaking in the extreme, and these scenes will always stand out as some of the finest that I will ever see.  But make no mistake about it, I view this as an action film first, not as a emotional drama.  And since I view it this way, I strongly encourage action fans who somehow avoided this movie to give it a chance, because heart-pounding entertainment doesn't get any better than this.",Titanic

Even when it comes to the issues I have with this film, most of them are pretty much similar to those I have with the play. And I've always found these issues justifiable to some extent.

This film was director James Cameron's greatest cinematic success, a larger-than-life, epic thriller romance brought to life by a strong cast and an overall expensive production. It came as no surprise that this beloved film swept the Oscars, earning the movie 11 Oscars including Best Picture. This one film made actor Leonardo DiCaprio a bankable star. James Cameron spent several years investing on this great project, recreating a model of the Titanic which he then sunk, hired costume designer Debora Lynn Scott, an expert on period fashion for 1912, haunting music by James Horner, production design by Peter Lamont, art direction by Martin Laing and cinematographer Russell Carpenter whose rich color and panoramic scenes establish an intense realism, especially in the latter portions. The hype surrounding the film ? Not only Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet's chemistry as the lovers, but the powerfully emotional and human drama of surviving the most famous shipwreck in history. The film opens in the present day, where ambitious entrepreneur Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) unearths relics from the sunken Titanic, among them a sketching of a beautiful woman wearing a priceless diamond pendant, which is what he is really after. It belongs to Titanic survivor Rose Dewitt Bucater (played by ""Old Hollywood"" star Gloria Stuart) who is 100 something years old. She tells her story and we return to 1912, following the life of the characters on board that doomed voyage. Rose at age 17 (Kate Winslet) is a rich American girl on her way to Philadelphia to get married to millionaire Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane) whom she met at her university and has not truly fallen for. She is reluctant to marry or to take part of a stuffy lifestyle she finds meaningless, not because she wouldn't mind being wealthy but because it would mean being denied her personal freedom. These were sexist times and the movie clearly suggests this. Hockley may love Rose but he is not presented in a sympathetic light and is generally ruthless, arrogant and domineering. Rose's mother is a self-absorbed social climber who is pressuring her own daughter into a marriage of convenience without a thought to her daughter's personal happiness. When the desperately depressed Rose attempts suicide, American Jack Dawson (Dicaprio) saves her. The two strike up a romance, breaking social class barriers and provoking the wrath of Caledon Hockley. The last part of the film deals entirely with every single detail of the ship's demise from the minute it hits the iceberg to the minute it sinks, bottom's up, into the Atlantic waters. Impressive performances by minor characters such as Kathy Bates' Molly Brown, the only wealthy woman who was not a snob unlike the rest of the aristocratic brood, Jonathan Hyde's impetuous ship designer Bruce Ismay and Victor Garber's sensitive and resourceful Captain Andrews. This is a superb film and one that is sure to stir the soul every time you view it. Although it's quite long (longer than the standard 2 hour film), it is certain worth sitting through. Immerse yourself into the year 1912, journey across the Atlantic on that ill-fated maiden voyage and experience the passionate love of youth all over again. Perhaps the most rewarding aspects of the film is its verisimilitude. James Cameron knew enough about the Titanic to suffuse the film with such poignant realities as the elderly German-Jewish Strauss couple who refused to leave their bed and died in each other's arms, the Captain opting to go down with the ship, the orchestra playing on even while the ship sank, the issue of insufficient life boats and the irrepressible character of Molly Brown, who had won millions when her husband struck gold in Colorado, journeyed to Europe and returned home to America on the Titanic where she acted heroically by saving as many people as she possibly could. The real characters of John Jacob Astor, the richest man in America at the time, Guggenheim, and others. This film remains a wonderful and bittersweet tale of love and survival and a movie that represented the zenith of 90's cinema.",Titanic
170,Prichards12345,"Too much Kate and Leo, too little Titanic",7,15 April 2012,"I know in advance this review is not going to be popular; but it is my honest opinion for what it's worth. This is not a review of the 3-D version.The final hour of this movie is incredibly captivating; the effects are astonishing, the human drama endlessly gripping and the horror of the terrible tragedy deeply moving and powerful. Direction by James Cameron is impeccable, he thoroughly deserved his Oscar; the film looks wonderful and the music score is marvellous.But is it really such a classic? I think not, personally. A Night To Remember may have dated effects-wise but it tells the story of The Titanic in a superior way to this movie. The big problem for me is the script; which for the most part I think is quite poor. Cameron lifts whole segments from A Night To Remember, inserts dialogue from the testimonies given during the enquiry into the cause of the disaster, and alters history in a way that must have been quite shocking to the descendants of those involved. Officer Murdoch, for instance. He did not shoot two passengers; nor is it very likely he committed suicide. Murdoch's decision to reverse the engines when the iceberg was spotted probably caused the disaster - Titantic would have missed it had the full ahead order been given; even a nose-on impact would not have sunk the ship. But there is no evidence whatsoever Murdoch, who distinguished himself in the aftermath of the accident, committed suicide. Just a few passenger rumours that one of the officers shot himself.Kate and Leo. Nice acting from Kate, DiCaprio is simply too young for the man of the world artist. He has matured into a very fine actor, but the ""romance"" never convinces me for an instant. Far too much time is spent on it; with the result that the story of the Titanic is sort of shoe-horned into the movie in a series of brief sequences. The whole question of The Californian is omitted to give Kate and Leo more screen time, and The Carpathia barely appears. Lightoller's remarkable escape is hardly referenced: and here the brave but slightly misguided officer comes across as panicky and arrogant. Very unfair indeed.The result is rather fake emotionalism and moonshine, rather like Avatar, in fact, although admittedly Titanic is a better movie.Some of the acting in this movie is also very poor. Billy Zane is quite awful as Cal. He gives a performance that would do Dick Dastardly proud. All he really needed was a few moustache twirls and evil titters. One-dimensional character; one dimensional acting. Excellent actors like Kathy Bates, Bernard Hill and David Warner are wasted in this movie.The film has much to commend it but my honest assessment is that it also has a lot of flaws. Time for you to mark me down! :)",Titanic
171,RJBurke1942,"Commercially, a titanic success, great direction, but...",5,31 August 2006,"Before this film, the director, James Cameron was best known for action thrillers such as Terminator, Aliens, The Abyss and True Lies  all of which delivered the goods for action fans. After sitting through Titanic, however, I think he should have stayed with the true action-thriller genre, because when you mix genres, you can get mixed results. And, in this case, it shows...The story of the Titanic is well known: an 'unsinkable' ship sinks on its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York in 1912 with most of the male passengers dying. Cameron, using the technical wizardry he'd perfected in his earlier works, made you feel as though you were actually there, instead of being a mere spectator; the special effects are truly stunning. For action fans, that aspect of the film is relatively brief, however, because the bulk of the film and the very contrived plot are more concerned with the recovery of a fabulous jewel  a symbol of love -- from the existing wreck, left there by the heroine, Rose (Kate Winslet) with her all too brief lover, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) who perishes as the ship sinks. How the two lovers come together in the film and how the jewel comes to have so much significance forms the basis of the plot; the details of the sub-plot  the actual events leading to and including the sinking -- are mere props to the overall story of first love. The metaphor is thus complete  as the ship sinks on its first voyage, so also first love sinks.All of that is explored in flashback, as a burgeoning love between two people who would not otherwise have met, anytime, anywhere else. So the actual loss of the Titanic is, in that sense, incidental to the greater loss suffered by each and every person who lost a loved one in that tragedy. To that extent, the film succeeds in its presentation but only because of the calibre of the acting. As an account of the tragedy of the Titanic, however, it's a misnomer and a failure; while, as entertaining escapism  well, as the saying goes -- nothing succeeds like excess.To find out how the tragic event actually happened, you'd be better off getting a copy of A Night To Remember (1958) from your video store instead.",Titanic
172,Christian_Dimartino,One of the best movies ever made.,10,5 July 2010,"In the 90's and 80's, director James Cameron was king of the world. Next to Steven Spielberg. He was a director that made groundbreaking motion pictures, like Spielberg. But did Spielberg make two of three of the top films ever made? No. Though Spielberg's films are a little better, Cameron's films are timeless.Cameron, who directed films like Avatar, Terminator and T2, should be most proud of 1997's best picture winning Titanic. Though Avatar was visually astonishing, it was no Titanic. Both films are dramas, both a little romance, both epic. But really? Can you top a film like Titanic?Titanic is one of the best films ever made. It truly is something beautiful. I know it's a little late to write a review about it but I have never appreciated it til now. I mean i'd always liked it but have never really loved it like I do now.I'm sure we all know how the film goes. Cause everyone has seen it. A group of researchers are looking for a necklace call""The heart of the ocean"". The person who has it is a 100 year old woman named Rose. While searching for the necklace, Rose tells the story of what happened to her while aboard ""The Titanic"".What happened? Well, Rose, at once engaged to a jerk(played by Billy Zane), falls in love with a poor boy named Jack(played by Leonardo DiCaprio). The two of them experience tons of things, even risking their lives for each other. Until the terrible crash on the iceberg. Titanic is a sweeping epic. It's beautiful, well acted, romantic, at first sad but now you'll probably get over it. The ending,for years, has made people angry. Eventually now we'll have to accept it. But that Rose is kind of a double crosser.Kate Winslet is a terrific actress,don't get me wrong. But she didn't deserve the nomination over Leonardo Dicaprio. The Oscars have cheated him many times. He deserves something I think. Especially for Gilbert Grape.Someday, he will receive something.The two actors had terrific chemistry together. That's why when they reunited for Revolutionary road,where instead of playing two lovers they play a couple that hates each other, I was surprised. I loved that movie too.Why did IMDb give it a rating it the 7's? I don't get it. This movie is flawless. I know it's long. But it doesn't matter. My favorite film, Magnolia, is 3 hours long too but I don't care. All great films are long. The best ones are long. Hence, why Titanic is one of the greatest films ever made. If you haven't seen it, there's something wrong with you. Titanic sweeps you.Titanic: 4/4*Note* I have just seen Titanic 3-D and it is still the spectacular film it was then... but possibly even better.",Titanic

174,emm,The Greatest Motion Picture of all time..??,9,31 January 1999,"So you flip through the cable channels on your remote. The same old music videos are running, and the reruns get tiring. Later, you find something interesting. The evening news, Entertainment Tonight, 60 Minutes, VH1, and every other network airs clips from this, the biggest money-making film in history. TITANIC emerges as a genuine Hollywood classic for the second generation of American cinema. Never since GONE WITH THE WIND has there been powerful moviemaking with heavy genius from James Cameron. It's more than just a love story. It's an all-out disaster movie with style and vigor combined with a creative instrumental music score. It even began the craze that lured us into discoveries of the gigantic ship that never proved itself when it sunk anyway.Brilliant use of photography is what stands out the best. Imagine every single little piece of detail that wouldn't fit on this message. Replicas of the engine room and the interior designs are highly crafted to maximize the full experience of being on the Titanic while sailing on crisp, clear sea water filled with dolphins swimming with grace. During the night, one can look up the starry skies while the bright lights shine. How tragic it is for a luxury liner to capsize in half, sinking miles beneath the surface, and showing off the greatest achievement in motion picture special effects! A job extremely well done! Who will match this kind of excellence in the near future?As for the players, the pair of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are now remembered as the Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh of the next generation. Both are young, of course, and they really can ACT! Winslet should have taken home the Oscar (what blasphemy of those Academy Awards judges!). Her performance as ""Rose"" is a show stealer, as she did most of the incredible acting far better than today's young actresses. From smoking a cigarette, to possessing true beauty, to posing nude, to being a heroine, and to become a survivor, this will be a role so hard to beat in Winslet's future films. DiCaprio, on the other hand, also does magnificent as a ""street boy"" and a ""troublemaker"". The second half is the most important time to discover his best talents, including the end. Both are sensational in almost every respect.Well, you can't always expect a movie to be perfect. TITANIC's shortcomings are relatively minor. The ""modernized"" scenes don't quite prove true to a historical masterpiece made with expensive sets and decorations. Mr. Jerry Garcia Lookalike should've changed his shirt, instead of wearing the one with ""Happy Face"" shot in the head. But Gloria Stuart as the old ""Ross"" makes up for the modern touch in telling and revisiting the Titanic story through her past experiences. It's also important that we already know how the disaster had become, and that the movie tells under a fictional basis.Of localized interest: Diana Morgan was once a TV news anchor for an NBC station out here. She has recently taken on an acting career playing the role of a news reporter, notably in BABYLON 5. You will hardly get to notice her on that small TV set shown at the start of the film, but you can hear her voice.Over three hours of powerful and unprecedented movie imagery. To date, it may very well be the greatest film ever made.",Titanic
175,yenlo,Lacked believability.,4,23 June 1999,"Not the greatest film of all time but then again not the worse. Titanic is, at best, an average movie which contains some pretty impressive special effects. The story however is not believable and neither are the characters. It was way too long for one thing. I do applaud James Cameron for target marketing this film toward the right audience i.e. the teenage/younger crowd which is where it made its money. That of course IS the bottom line. This film probably isn't even the best one about the tragic event. Years from now people may view this movie and say ""How did this win the Academy Award for Best Picture that year?""",Titanic
176,gigan-92,"Good, YesThe BestNah",7,22 November 2010,"C+ The best grossing film of all time, until recently that is, but is it really the best film ever? Even worthy of getting all that money? Upon initial viewing, many probably thought so, but I'm not one of those. It does have its strong suits, and James Cameron has rarely, if ever, failed me. This film stands out as quite different in tone contrast to say ""Aliens', ""T2', or even ""Avatar"". Note the first two, f*CK Avatar, use low-key lighting, while this film is just so bright all the time. The performances are grade A in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are great throughout , and the end sequence was of course astonishing and a leap forward in visual effects.My biggest problem with this movie? It over does a love story to the point it hits two hours or so, and then we get an hour more or less of epic disaster with tragedy and believable chaos. But the first two hours just seem to drag on, quite unnecessarily at that. Along with that, the score was dismal at best. Naturally the only scene to defy this was the ""last song"" instant as it sank. One of the main things that draws me to a film it its score, or sometimes a lack there of. Sappy romantic themes and an unfitting climax music as thousands drown. It just was distracting and honestly didn't belong there. Overall, ""Titanic"" is worth seeing and all, but far from being the best movie ever, or even close for that matter. This a movie where I definitely rent the DVD, practically fall sleep an hour or so in, then wake up and say ""what the? Still not yet?"", and then just use chapter selection to get to see the climax.",Titanic
177,FlickJunkie-2,A colossal filmmaking achievement,9,31 August 2000,"At over $1.8 Billion worldwide (excluding rentals), `Titanic' is the most commercially successful film of all time.  That is double the next highest grossing film (Star Wars: The Phantom Menace).  Nominated for 14 Academy Awards, it won 11 including best picture in 1998.  Everything about this film was big.  It ran over 3 hours and had a budget of $200 million which is larger than the U.S. box office for all but 30 movies in the history of filmmaking.  This was a TITANIC film in every sense of the word.  But, was it any good?  Well, actually it was!The film was written and directed by James Cameron, who before this was most renowned for writing and directing `Terminator' films.  The story was a combination love story, period piece and disaster movie.  As a love story was good.  As a period piece, it was wonderfully precise in its myriad details, both generally and as to specifics about the Titanic and her passengers.  As an epic disaster movie, it was utterly colossal.From a directorial perspective, this film is unparalleled; a feat of gargantuan proportions.  In addition to the normal directorial duties, Cameron had to coordinate mammoth model-building projects, deep sea filming of the original ship, thousands of hours of painstaking research, elaborate visual effects, and hundreds of special sets.  To be able to pull all those elements together at all is a superhuman task.  The result was truly remarkable entertainment.Cameron took a chance on Leonardo DiCaprio.  The studios wanted Matthew McConaughey but Cameron insisted on DiCaprio.  It was a gamble that paid off.  DiCaprio gave a career performance and his enthusiasm and charm lit up the screen.  Kate Winslet was also a fresh talent with only five minor films to her credit before Titanic'.  Her performance was sparkling and her chemistry with DiCaprio made the love story urgent and magical.  Oddly, she hasn't worked much since, and is fast slipping back into the obscurity from whence she came.This was not as much a film as it was a fluctuation in the space-time continuum.  Forces and emotions from the original event were transported to 1997, and they clutched us with a power that left us spellbound.  It was neither the best story ever told, nor the best film ever made, but it was certainly the greatest filmmaking achievement to date in its sheer size and scope.  As a motion picture, I rated it a 9/10.  As an epic, there is no scale large enough to rate it.  The box office speaks for itself.",Titanic
178,moviesleuth2,Timeless,10,6 January 2010,"It's bitterly ironic that the biggest blockbuster of all time is not on the IMDb's Top 250. Even stranger still, many who loved it at the time of its release have now turned on it (just ask anyone under the age of 25). This is not due to its quality, but to its hype. It goes without saying that a film this big had immense publicity at the time of its release, but what no one learned until too late is that there is too much of a good thing. People began to tire of hearing about what the stars (especially the new heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio) were doing, and they were sick of hearing gossip magazines never shutting up about ""Titanic."" The film had the odds against it: it's a romance, and that is one of the most volatile genres in terms of popularity. By the time the spoofs of the film's most famous scenes came along, ""Titanic's"" reputation was already in danger. After that, people began only to see the spoofs, and now the film's popularity has sunk to where the real ship is.I had fond memories of the film from when it was popular, so I decided to perform an experiment: even after the immense backlash the film suffered, could it still hold up? The answer is a resounding YES!""Titanic"" opens when a treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) finds a drawing of a woman wearing the diamond that he is looking for. Soon after releasing his findings, an elderly woman (Gloria Stuart) claims that it's her in the picture. So Lovett flies her out to his ship to tell her the story behind the diamondAs a young woman, she was sailing to America to live the life of a boring society lady in a loveless marriage. Planning on ending it all, she is about to jump ship when she is saved by a young man from steerage. Thus begins a classic love story that is doomed from the start by complications other than those they began with.The reason the film is so good is because the two central characters are brilliantly written and acted. Leonardo DiCaprio became an instant heartthrob to girls around the world (something he apparently hated), and it's not hard to see why. DiCaprio has everything to make the male lead of an epic romance work: he's good-looking and talented (Winslet was honored with an Oscar nomination for her performance, although it's hard to understand why DiCaprio was left out, because he equals her). Jack Dawson is an immensely likable guy. He falls hard for Rose, someone who he knows is clearly out of his league. But he's so immensely likable that we want him to win Rose's heart. His new lover, Rose, is no ordinary society girl, much as she tries. She can't stand the rigidly controlled life she's going to lead, and Jack is her escape. But while she may wear a corset, she's no damsel in distress. She's independent and tough. The romance works because Jack and Rose are meant for each other.Their supporting cast is excellent. The two most important supporting characters are Rose's fiancée, Cal Hockley, and her mother, Ruth (Frances Fisher). Cal Hockley is a vicious snob with a constant sneer on his face. He comes from a wealthy family, and will do anything to get what he wants. He demands obedience from Rose, something she will not give (to anyone, much less Cal). Her mother, Ruth, is just as snobbish and cruel, but she's also desperate. Their family was left virtually penniless, and she's trying to save face. As cruel and despicable as they are, neither one becomes a caricature. Zane and Fisher should have dually been honored with awards for their acting. Bates is especially noteworthy as the delightfully brash ""new money"" Molly Brown.""Titanic"" was the most expensive film of the 20th century, and it's clear that every penny was put to good use. ""Epic"" doesn't begin to describe this movie. It's huge in spectacle, and the sinking of the ship, which takes up the last half hour, is jaw-dropping. But that's not the only place where the effects were used. We never get a sense that we're looking at sets or CGI; from every frame of the ship, we believe that we are on the ship with the characters. Interesting note: Cameron actually went down to the wreckage and filmed footage there. But that doesn't stop there. Cameron wrote a script that allows us to view every part of the ship (and in a way that's plausible.James Cameron has long been considered a god of action movies, but this is the first time his skills were honored. Not only is Cameron a wizard with special effects, he is also a master storyteller. ""Titanic"" is a long film (as all epics are), but not one of the 3+ hours of footage is wasted. The film moves, and there is never a dull spot. He knows the speed at which a person gets involved in the story, and uses this to his advantage. But the biggest accomplishment is that he makes the romance, one of the most difficult genres to dabble in, work with immense effectiveness. The romance burns up the screen, so much that we're more concerned with Jack and Rose's fates than we are taking in the sight of the sinking ship. And the scene where Jack draws Rose's picture is potently erotic (especially for a PG-13 movie, which shows not real nudity or sex, but it is strongly implied).I realize that I am not writing this to people who haven't seen the movie (are there such people?). I am writing it to those who are now convinced that this is a sappy and painfully bad film. I assure you: it's as good as it was the first time you saw it.",Titanic

Despite this, though, the film was indeed a masterpiece. The sheer scale of the sets and entire production were simply mind blowing! The sinking of the Titanic was the greatest ship sinking scene EVER and was done with such meticulous detail that one would think they actually really sunk the ship. Off course, that was not the case, though, as it were all (very elaborate) sets, most of which were destroyed during the making of the film.Leonardo made for a very likable hero, quite frankly one a lot of guys can relate to. The young lovers were so different and yet so alike, and their love story was almost endearing.

188,LoneWolfAndCub,Truly One Of The Greatest Films To Date...,10,27 October 2005,"James Cameron's (Aliens, The Terminator) Titanic is one of the greatest love stories ever told. This film has a special place in my heart as one of the saddest films to date. The two leads, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, do a truly magnificent job at portraying the two doomed, young lovers Jack and Rose. James Horner's score is probably one of the best scores I have ever heard. The set pieces are absolutely stunning, the Titanic is re-created with authenticity and beauty (the look of the exterior and interior of the ship is amazing). The finale is one of the best I have seen: It's suspenseful and sad. Happy and tragic.The plot focuses on Jack and Rose. Jack being a poor street boy and Rose being a very rich, engaged women. They both happen to be on the doomed voyage that is the Titanic's. As soon as they meet each other love blossoms and they are both drawn closer and closer together. When the ship hits the iceberg a tale of survival and heart-breaking decisions is brought to life. The supporting cast consists of Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Gloria Jones, David Warner and Bill Paxton.Many people hate Titanic because they think it's a corny, overrated love-story thats just an excuse for spending a lot of money (plus it is very cool to hate Titanic). It's far more than that. The love-story is brilliantly told and is very tragic, the ending will have most people in tears. The scenes of the ship's destruction are amazing and very well done. The acting is top notch from everyone. This movie rightly deserved its 11 Oscar wins.5/5 from me. I urge everyone who hasn't seen it to see it.",Titanic
189,Antagonisten,Better than expected,6,18 January 2005,"I don't consider romantic drama to be my genre exactly. And since Leonardo DiCaprio was a notorious pretty boy (cast mostly to satisfy teenage girls) expectations were exceptionally low. But i was actually pleasantly surprised.The story revolves around the poor and artistic Jack and the rich girl Rose. They meet by chance on the Titanic and fall in love. First their love has to stand the test of class difference, then the test of the ship sinking...When i say i was pleasantly surprised that of course has to be weighed against the fact that expectations were exceptionally low. But still this is actually a lot more entertaining than i could ever have dreamed it would be. Most of the credit for that i would have to give James Cameron who seldom disappoints. But while this movie does entertain (not least because of very impressive visuals) it's still a very simple and basic story. I guess what it comes down to is expectations. If you expect it to be movie of the century, a deep and sensitive film, you will be sorely disappointed. It is well-made, decently acted, beautifully shot and rather entertaining. As long as you remember what kind of movie you are watching. I rate it 6/10.",Titanic
190,Beejerman,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),10,10 March 2021,"The stage curtains open ...Not since the advent of the 1995 film, ""Braveheart"", have I ever been as enthralled or emotionally invested into a movie as I was with ""Titanic"". I knew going in, just from the trailer and word-of-mouth, it was going to be good, but I had no idea the ride I was in for when the lights dimmed in the theater that night. I have never understood (and still don't understand) the negative backlash that I've read/heard when it come to this epic film. Because, it is just that - epic in every way, shape or form.We follow along as a young wayfarer named Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) wins a ticket to board the Titanic in a game of chance. During its fateful voyage, he meets and falls for an upper-class girl named Rose (Kate Winslet). Under the thumb of her demanding fiance (Billy Zane) and her narrow-minded mother, Rose is introduced to a different side to life by Jack, and he helps her to find her own individuality and independence, alienating her from a life that she already despises. She must now decide if she'll choose to stay where she is, or leave and have a life with Jack - a decision that is further compounded when the mighty ship strikes an iceberg leading to the eye popping conclusion.What makes this film work is the love story. A lot of the negative reviews I've read complain because there is a love story. But, without it, this movie doesn't work. I am not interested in watching a biography about the Titanic, I want a good story - and this movie certainly delivers that. I was completely invested in Jack and Rose, and when the ship began to sink, I was with them both every step of the way.I highly recommend this movie at 10 stars out of 10. The event of the ship sinking alone was awe inspiring. You are right there in the scene. I could not take my eyes off the screen.

191,oOoBarracuda,Titanic,8,28 April 2016,"Rounding out a three-way tie for most Academy Award wins, James Cameron's 1997 Best Picture-winning film Titanic, was as massive in scope as the doomed titular White Star liner. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet join together to tell the story of the most well-known nautical disaster of the 20th century. Cameron takes some liberties with the telling of the disaster, largely through the injected romance between a young aristocrat and a struggling artist. The story is told in sweeping Cameron fashion, that he is well known for, through a beautiful juxtaposition of tragedy and doomed courtship. Boarding the luxurious R.M.S. Titanic with her family and fiancé, Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) feels like she is in shackles boarding a slave boat. The beautiful young woman of 17 is being married off to a man that views her as property and a reflection of himself rather than a person to build a life with. Once the ship docks in Philadelphia, Rose is to marry Caledon 'Cal' Hockley (Billy Zane), a wealthy oil businessman in a union arranged by her mother Ruth Dewitt Bukater (Frances Fisher). Rose has no attraction or interest in building a life together with Cal, and their marriage is seen as a way out of the financial difficulty the death of Rose's father has brought to their family. While pondering her future plight along the ship deck, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor vagabond who won his ticket on the liner in a poker game locks eyes with her. Instantly smitten, Jack's new role is to break social barriers and explore a romance with Rose. Jack finally gets his chance when he talks Rose off the ledge of the ship one night when she is consumed by despair over her upcoming nuptials and sees suicide as the only way out. Being invited to dinner with Cal and Rose's family as a gesture of thanks for his being at the right place at the right time, Jack borrows a suit and charms Rose. Knowing how she feels about her life and fiancé, Jack stops at nothing to convince Rose that they can endure a relationship with each other filled with love and the mutual freedom Rose so desires. The story of the doomed love is told through 101-year old Rose after her necklace has been found aboard the sunken wreckage by a team of excavators led by Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton).Taken at what it is, Titanic is a wonderful film. Cameron beautifully juxtaposes the romance along with the historically accurate depiction of the ship's voyage. The film is heavy on romance, however, and if that's not your preferred genre you will struggle to look past it and focus on the history alone. The film looks as beautiful as it sounds, which is no easy feat given the subject manner. The elegant music accompanies the riches that shine through the set and cinematography in a perfect union. Leonardo DiCaprio is wonderful in the film and walks the line between boyhood charm and adult charisma that can be counted on quite well. As good as Winslet was in the role, she seemed miscast for the part. Her mature beauty was difficult to accept as a 17-year-old young woman. The chemistry between the two actors, however, was magical, and may be the reason to overlook Winslet not being believable as a teenager. Class and social standings are mainstays of exploration throughout the film. Rose loves art, and Jack is an artist in the time where even Pablo Picasso's works are looked upon as infantile, with Cal proclaiming that he ""will never amount to a somebody"". In a world that only accepts one way to live and one idea to live up to, Jack and Rose can't find a place to fit in, which is only made better by them finding each other; and really, who can't relate to the feeling of being an outsider in the world in which they live?",Titanic
192,ronakkotian,What an achievement!,9,15 July 2019,"James Cameron's Titanic was something else. It's amazing to think how this movie came out in 1997. Titanic is a film that many will remember that broke ground. Not just for the actors involved but for filmmaking in general.Titanic is very, very well made. You can clearly tell that this was a passion project for James Cameron. He wanted to make this movie special and he has. The amount of research that Cameron had to do to make the film look realistic is evident.The entire set is a whole world in itself. Cameron's direction transports us to ins and outs of the ship which all look so beautiful. The atmosphere and grandness of the ship sticks with you especially during the inevitable sinking scene where you can feel the terror and panic aboard. The cinematography is pure brilliance. The ship has a very elegant feel and the set design and costumes from the inside also adds to that feeling. Visually, this is one the best looking films of all time.The acting was sublime all through the film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are in top form and have some of the best chemistry in a film ever. Their romance seemed so believable that I never felt bored during it. The supporting cast are also great, especially Billy Zane.I have to give immense praise to James Cameron for handling this film. He took a lot of time researching and working to make this movie the grand spectacle it is and feel as accurate as possible to the real incident. Whilst some think this film is overrated, you cannot deny the sheer effort that went into crafting this movie.",Titanic

Kate Winslett was horribly miscast and there was no chemistry between her character and DiCaprio's Jack. The script was dire and the baddies were just missing their twirly moustaches. It was difficult to care about what happened to anyone at any point during the interminable denouement. it seemed to me that like many other Cameron movies the bottom line was the profit to be made from the extreme overhyping of the whole thing. Avatar was only just better (which is not to say it was any good either). Definitely the law of diminishing returns was played out here. I think it halted Leo's career in it's tracks, given the ""heartthrob"" title attributed to him. Conversely and inexplicably it boosted Kate's career beyond any explanation.",Titanic

198,mukava991,good retelling of great tragedy,8,2 August 2008,"James Cameron's Titanic holds up very well indeed after more than ten years since initial release. The minuses now are the same as then but they are minor in comparison to the plusses. First of all, the Titanic is one of the grandest tragedies of human history. The highest and mightiest could tumble. It was an analogy to the state of the world, almost like a foreshadowing of the First World War when all that seemed eternal disintegrated with spectacular suddenness.Cameron approaches the task primarily as a hardware technician. The ship looks the way it has to look - grandiose, solid, lavishly appointed. The physical details are spot on, down to the last piece of china. This all helps. The use of CGI during the prolonged sinking is largely state of the art even now.The idea of putting a story of young lovers at the center of the film is a sound, if trite, way to give us the universal through the particular. The film would have been just as gripping if Cameron had chosen a more Altmanesque approach whereby a whole group of characters would be given more or less equal weight as they made their way to journey's end. Here the focus is on the teenage couple: unhappy rich girl (Kate Winslet) and working-class bohemian artiste (Leonardo DiCaprio). The problem with these usually fine actors is that too often their youthful brio seems forced, as if Cameron as director/screenwriter is straining to point out their youth, their vitality, their exuberance, in contrast to Winslet's stuffy social set which disapproves of their alliance. The best acting comes from Billy Zane as the arrogant, sadistic, petulant fiancé of Winslet who stops at nothing to separate her from unwashed upstart DiCaprio. Zane gets it all right, including the clipped prep school accent which barely conceals his primal, frustrated rage at being trumped by someone from the lower classes. DiCaprio comes across as a modern suburban high school student playing a street urchin in a drama class presentation. There is no real edge to him. In fact, if the casting had been reversed it would have made much more sense. But DiCaprio's youth, looks and agility carry him through the spectacle. Besides, we don't go to spectacles for acting nuance.Cameron's script isn't as dreadful as some claim, but it has significant shortcomings. (Screenwriting was the only major category in which Titanic was not nominated for an Oscar - and for good reason.) A bit of working over by a competent script doctor would have made it truer. Amazingly, considering Cameron himself has some background in visual arts, the situations and dialogue touching on questions of painting are embarrassingly unimaginative and superficial. And much of the banter between Winslet and DiCaprio sounds late 20th century, not 1912. The conflict between the haughty first-class passengers and those beneath them is perhaps overdone. Frances Fisher is touching as Winslet's socially striving mother for whom we feel both pity and contempt as she pushes her daughter into marriage with a soulless brute. Gloria Stuart as Kate Winslet grown old and Victor Garber as the ship's designer who sees his master creation ripped asunder also stand out. And some of the dinner table conversation in the first-class dining room is elegant and witty.One implausibility: The water temperature of the sea in which the Titanic sank was just above freezing. No human, save an Olympic athlete, or at least the young and vigorous, could have survived more than a few minutes in waters of that temperature. Survivors relate that the screaming of the passengers who landed in the water when the ship sank subsided after only a few minutes. None could survive the water. Yet Kate Winslet is seen wading neck deep in this ice bath for minutes on end as she struggles to rescue DiCaprio who has been handcuffed to steam pipes in a lower-level cabin. Then the two proceed through endless corridors of freezing water to the deck where they continue on, fighting their way through panicked crowds, breaking down barriers, leaping and scaling heights, etc. until they finally go down with the ship into the freezing sea where they survive for endless minutes more as they as they cling to debris.A CGI flaw: Just as false, occasionally Cameron's keyboard tappers and mouse movers add little puffs of computer-generated condensed breath to accompany the exhalations of actors in close up. Problem is, only intermittently does this condensation appear. One moment you see it, another moment it's gone.The interminable lovey-dovey blatherings between Winslet and DiCaprio as they float in the ice water quickly wear thin. Perhaps pre-teen girls (a major component of this film's box office) would be transfixed by this interlude, but surely most adults would be yearning for DiCaprio's character to die and get it over with.And even more dreadful than everything cited above is the treacly ""Our Love Will Go On,"" a pop song belted by Celine Dion over the closing credits. I am sick and tired of contemporary pop songs being tacked on to historical dramas.Finally, the ultimate film to see on this subject is ""Titanic: The Legend Lives On"" (1994), a fascinating and moving 4-hour-plus Arts & Entertainment Channel documentary about the Titanic from conception through construction through destruction, aftermath and cultural/historical legacy. More emotionally involving and fascinating than Cameron's movie. It will stay with you for a long time.",Titanic

James Cameron) Brock Lovett whilst investigating the wreckage of the Titanic, when he discovers a diamond, known as 'The Heart of the Ocean', as well as a drawn picture of a woman. An old lady contacts Lovett, claiming that she is the woman in the picture. What follows is a breathtaking story of Rose DeWitt Bukater on board the Titanic. On board she meets a poor boy named Jack Dawson who both fall for each other. Day's later, they both must try to survive when the great ship hits an iceberg and goes down deep into the ocean.If you ever want to see one of the best film-making examples, then 'Titanic' is one of them. Some of the lines might feel a bit cheesy and the love story lines might feel a bit too much love filled, but just watching it was an amazing experience, and i was only watching it on a DVD. The fact that the film is based on something which actually happened, makes it so tragic and so emotional to watch. I'm not normally an emotional guy, but i just felt devastated seeing everyone happening on it. The music doesn't help prevent the emotional experience, as it's some of the best music i've heard on dramatic sequences. The special effects are also amazing too with some amazing realistic shot of the ship. A lot people seem to be put off by this film, but i think its a work of movie making at its best.""Is there anybody alive out there?"" - Fifth Officer Lowe (Ioan Gruffudd)",Titanic
201,CinematicInceptions,"Decent, but overrated.",7,13 March 2017,"When I say that Titanic is overrated, I do not mean that it is bad. Did it deserve to win Best Picture? Not in my eyes, particularly when Good Will Hunting was competing with it. But it was not a waste of a budget, which is more than you can say for most movies with massive budgets. I have a number of problems with the story, but it was decent and it seems like James Cameron and company wanted to do a good job on it. Really, the idea behind this movie is rather praiseworthy. With the sinking of the Titanic being such a famous disaster event, having the story revolve around the exact happenings of that night would not really be that dramatic. On it's own the sinking is not that dramatic because we know it's going to happen, but now that we are invested in Jack and Rose's relationship, it has higher stakes and the question now becomes ""will they be able to both survive this tragedy?""I'll start with the things that I liked about the movie. Some of the early conversations with Jack and Rose were really good and created a tangible chemistry between the two of them. Whether you liked them as people or not, it is hard to refute that they care about each other sincerely. Jack sees the good in Rose rather than what she can do for him, and she is grateful to him for that. This is aided in no small part because the movie has an hour more than the average runtime to develop their relationship, but at least the extra time was put to good use. Secondly, I liked that attention was given to the ship's crew and officers. The officers and other employees were having to react to a totally unexpected crisis and have to make sacrifices and difficult decisions. In particular, I sympathized with the guilt of the officer who comes back and saves Rose. Lastly, the movie was very visually nice. The computer graphics and such were good, but not so good that they made things look unrealistic.On the downside, there were a few shots that seemed like an egregious waste of money. The huge sweeping pans of the ship and the shots of all the propellers and cogs moving were really not necessary and just seemed to be taking unnecessary advantage of the allotted budget. The grand scale of the sinking was okay because it was called for, but there was really no reason for such spectacle before-hand. The main issue I had was Rose. Now, if you love Titanic, skip the rest of this paragraph because I might make you not like it if you keep reading. Rose is effectively an American princess, which is not inherently a problem, but I found nothing to like about her. When Jack died, I didn't really care how it made her feel because she just didn't feel like a real person. Also, her conflict is not one that I think most people would identify with. She's trapped in her upper-class life, which makes perfect sense for someone living at that time, but I fail to see how that has relevance to anyone watching the movie in the '90's and beyond.If you're older than about 12 or 13, you've most likely already seen Titanic. If not, it's worth a try. You might be disappointed by it because your parents and/or friends have made it out to be this huge deal. It is long and although it tries to keep a good pace, you may get bored at times. I found that things dragged near the end, but I would guess that most people will get bored in the first half of the movie. One final thing to be aware of: the characters are relatively two dimensional. Nearly all of them are flawed, but they are more caricatures than real people. Overall Rating: 7.2/10",Titanic
202,jhaggardjr,A masterpiece,10,5 April 2000,"James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is a masterpiece. This is a brilliant film from start to finish. It's exciting, romantic, and never boring. I'm usually not a fan of movies that run over 3 hours long, but this is arguably my favorite 3 hour plus movie because it goes by fast. A year before this movie came out, CBS aired their two-part movie based on the 1912 sinking of the ship that was dubbed ""unsinkable"". It was O.K., but the 1997 theatrical film made the TV version look real flat by comparison. I've always had a fascination with the Titanic disaster, and this movie presents its depiction of the doomed ship in a frightening way. When I saw this movie the first time, at times I felt like I was on the Titanic. It's that good. Splendid acting, remarkable special effects, and masterful storytelling, this is a movie that I'll never forget.**** (out of four)",Titanic
203,baileycrawly,A Timeless Epic,9,13 July 2020,"There isn't much that can be said about James Cameron's Titanic that hasn't been said by the cast & crew, the audiences or the hours upon hours of bonus content that accompanies every release of the film for the last 15 years.Titanic is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. The sets are gorgeous and look exactly like the images of the Titanic, James Horner's score perfectly compliments the stunning visuals and tone throughout the film, the acting (particularly, of course, from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet) is second to none, the camera work James Cameron does throughout the movie helps to make the movie feel truly epic and heartbreaking. It's a perfectly balanced film that features a spontaneous love connection (with the chemistry to match it), but also doesn't take away from the truly tragic elements of the Titanic.It's a movie that is both sensationalized to suit Hollywood and the film-going public of its time and sensitive to the reality of its subject matter when it needs to be. It's like there's a switch that is flipped, as soon as the very real and horrific events of the Titanic begin to transpire on the screen, it switches to a reflection of the tragedy of the time in a respectful manner. The love and admiration James Cameron has for the ship is extremely evident as the film goes on, and he managed to craft a perfectly balanced story.It's an endearing film and a great way to ensure that the public always remembers what happened on the RMS Titanic. Of all the film adaptations (live-action and animated) that exist, this one is definitely the definitive, go-to version. It holds your interest with its perfect pacing and leaves you on the edge of your seat.",Titanic
204,SKG-2,Captivating experience that will stand the test of time,10,28 February 1999,"When I first saw this movie the day it opened, I was going in because I liked the cast, I like James Cameron's work, I was blown away by trailer, and I prefer not to judge a movie by its budget.  I am not a fanatic about the actual ship; my reaction has always been, ""It's a big ship, it sank.  So what?""  Back on opening day, though some rave reviews had already come out, some dissenting views had also come, and while interest was expected, no one knew the ultimate fate of the movie.  And at the theater I saw it in, the projector broke down three times in the first five minutes, and I think it's safe to say the audience I saw it with was ready to kill.  Then, finally, the movie went on interrupted.By the end, though we of course took the free passes the theater provided us to apologize for our inconvenience, we were transfixed by what we had seen on screen.  James Cameron is a director who tries here to make art out of pure entertainment, and he suceeds on a massive scale.  There were better movies in 1997(TITANIC was #8 on my top ten list that year; the first seven were, in order, THE SWEET HEREAFTER, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL, AS GOOD AS IT GETS, THE ICE STORM, ULEE'S GOLD, IN THE COMPANY OF MEN, and GROSSE POINTE BLANK), but this was the best pure entertainment of the year.  The physical achievement of the movie, of course, is not to be forgotten, particularly when the ship sinks, and the scene where Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose(Kate Winslet) are standing in the front of the boat (the ""I'm flying!"" scene), which, when I saw it in the trailer, was what made me want to see the movie.  But the love story worked for me as well, as did the wrap-around story of the old Rose (Gloria Stuart) remembering when she was in ""the heart of the ocean.""  DiCaprio is a good actor, and he's good here, though a bit too modern for me, but it's Winslet who gives the movie its heart, playing passion to the hilt.But as the 70's were the ""Me"" Decade, and the 80's were the ""Greed"" Decade, the 90's can probably best be described as the ""Backlash"" Decade.  As soon as a work or artist in popular culture (American anyway) becomes popular, it seems people have a felt need to line up and dump on it simply because a lot of other people like it, and they can't stand it.  This is not to say all popular culture is good.  Rather, it is to argue that just because a lot of people like something doesn't automatically make it bad.  This is not the movie of the year, the decade, or the century, but it's a great movie, and I wish people would get over themselves and not consider those of us who feel like I do cretins.  This will stand the test of time.",Titanic
205,dfle3,"Spectacular, but with lots of flaws",4,4 July 2008,"After seeing this movie years ago at the cinema I thought it was one of the worst movies of all time (as far as major studio pictures go). Thinking about it before posting up a review here, maybe I was a bit too harsh.In short, this story is a fictional tale of two star-crossed lovers on board a real life, famous ship (the ""Titanic"") that sank, killing a great percentage of its passengers and crew (um, sorry if that is a spoiler, but sheesh, you SHOULD know that!).When I am feeling particularly unkind about this film, some of my criticisms are: only director James Cameron could look at the story of the Titanic and think ""Hmmm. That story could make a good movie...IF ONLY IT HAD MORE DRAMA!"". Yeah, sinking ship, hundreds dead, needs MORE drama!Another peeve about this movie is how Cameron can't resist manipulating our sympathies to characters by resorting to melodrama and crudely drawn characters who we find easy to hate, in order to have us rooting for other characters. E.g. Billy Zane's character of Hockley. Didn't quite throw a chihuahua into the ice-cold ocean, but nasty enough to do everything short of this. Really, a more sophisticated script could have made him a figure deserving of our sympathy too.A minor peeve is how one of those star crossed lovers, Kate Winslet's Rose, is quite prescient and insightful about the ship's situation...just didn't seem very plausible for one so young and unschooled in such matters.Despite thinking this movie one of the all time stinkers (for a major studio release) I did, at the time, think it a master-stroke to have the two star-crossed lovers at the centre of this tale (Kate Winslet's ""Rose"" and Leonardo DiCaprio's ""Jack""). It is just a brilliant device in order to hook you and reel you into this great historical drama/tragedy. Again, it was a great pity that Cameron chose not to make a victim of people like Hockley as well, instead of demonising him. And it's not as if Cameron didn't have alternatives in his own script. For instance, Jack's sketching of Rose could have provided a more believable foundation on which to base a relationship on instead of the hysterical melodrama Cameron resorts to to get them together.Perhaps the time-frame of the sinking made melodrama necessary.Truly spectacular but deserved Razzies for things like script and direction.Despite my criticisms, when Titanic eventually hits the ice-berg, the movie is an absolute thrill ride and quite exhilarating.P.S. must put in a word for the great Australian song by Flash and the Pan ""Down among the dead men"". It's not in this movie (Celine Dion does the theme song), but the Flash and the Pan song is actually about the Titanic and is a brilliant pop song...beautiful too. Look it up on You Tube.",Titanic
206,Offworld_Colony,Titanic is a film that surprises me with its quality every time I watch it.,10,17 February 2020,"The problem with these iconic blockbusters that worm their way in to culture, is that their lasting image burned in to my brain is one of the fan culture, the parodies, the awards, the ripple of films influenced for decades after, and the legacy of the filmmakers and the technology going forwards, all which overshadow the actual merits of the film itself and eventually taint it in my mind; almost like a kind of warped reverse/retconned-hype.Titanic is an elegant harmony of period drama and destruction porn. With a 70/30 split of the action in the back-end like theatre. Managing to weave his underwater interests in to a tragic love story in a Shakespeare vein gives it a quintessential classical Hollywood feel. There's some cheesy acting and dialogue but it's all in keeping with the blockbuster ethos; Cameron's on-the-nose dialogue (clearly trumped up by ghost-writers here) fits the classic nature of the film and produces some memorable, quotable lines.Cameron clearly knows wonder and spectacle, but also attention to detail and minutiae; the examinations of the microcosm of class, the revelry in such feats of engineering and artistry. Titanic, adopting a sublimely classic structure, manages a marriage of all these elements very well. It jumps through time elegantly, crossing over tacitly also in to excavation drama and faux-biopic.There's a tangible (read: expensive) earthy quality to the authentically constructed sets and meticulous and completely fashionable costumes. And the superb editing enhances the tactile nature of the film. Cameron really knows pacing in this film; always paced just right, never languid, never passing over the important moments, almost no scene that doesn't serve a purpose; the film's breathing room allows for many callbacks and twists and turns and it can be genuinely tense at times. Again, elegance is the word that comes to mind, a perfect synthesis on shooting and editing style and subject matter.The audio has real range depending on where the characters are standing, I noticed archways or covered areas changing the aural landscape and it's got some properly wistful and hummable music (which you want in the theme) even if the music sometimes sounds like the start of the Home Alone theme, or whatever other Christmas move I kept seeing in my head when the music began.The picture is superb. In fact it may be the best I've ever seen. It's a pristine image that looks like you're perring through the cleanest window you've ever seen. It's a masterclass in image reconstruction. The lighting is also lovely, timeless, pretty but not too saccharine, the night shots still impressive. The 3D is cautious but sumptuous. Never gratuitous and never party to ghosting or too many jarring planes of 3D image intersecting. It's clear that Cameron was always interested in framing his shots with many layers which lends itself perfectly for this kind od post-post-conversion. There's a mirror shot featuring Billy Zane and his Manservant that exhibit the quality of the original shooing and the 3D conversion all at once.The effects still hold up, some are noticeable but not as jarring as some techniques used a decade later. At this time, effects; visual and special, motion capture, matte paintings, miniatures and CGI were all used and blended only when it would have looked its best, represented the best intention of the director. Watching the extras of Titanic alongside the extras of The Hobbit it's depressing how these effects work, particularly mocap and CGI that is now used largely to cut corners on set, or make up for a lack of script, or to cut costs.In terms of acting, DiCaprio solidifies himself as a charming but cool, real and tangible loveable young tyke, his believable, youthful, effortless acting a joy to watch. Winslet goes through the best arc; her character perfectly embodying both the uptight and the energy of youth, she has real nuance and layers that come out of her character. But it's Zane that I love the most. He's superbly hilarious, watching him a riot, an actor understanding his role perfectly. I am fascinated by Zane who plays a man perfectly from his time; the relaxed air of privilege. He's not mean or evil, he just has edge; he's just exactly a product of the time and his class. He's not even a bad sport, with a knowing sense of humour and a desperate human element.In conclusion, Titanic is a film that I couldn't see it that often, but when I've forgotten the clichés and the well studied beats of it, it's a surprising film of great technical prowess, with gravitas and charm by the bucket-load. It's memorable and a brilliant synthesis of themes and genres. It is expertly crafted cinema in the traditional sense. And in light of recent massive, world-altering tragedies it even takes on new light and new importance as a very raw and emotional product.",Titanic

Titanic, which struck an iceberg and sank in the North Atlantic Sea on April 15, 1912.  The movie jumps from present day, to the day of that ill-fated voyage, then returns to the present day.  That unfortunate day begins with Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) winning a ticket to ride the Titanic back to America where he is from. While on board, he meets Rose DeWitt Bukater (Winslet), a woman being forced to marry a man she does not love.  While on board, Jack and Rose develop a loving relationship, and spend all their time together hiding their feelings from all those who oppose.  Titanic follows the two as they fall in love, evade the jealous ex-fiancé, Cal Hockley (Zane), and eventually watch as their very short time begins to come to an end due to the sinking of the great Titanic. 	Of the many characters that went through changes in Titanic, I chose to discuss Rose DeWitt Bukater, and why she represents a three-dimensional character.  When we first are introduced to Rose, we get the impression that she is a little `rich bitch.'  She pulls up on the boarding dock in a caravan of new cars, welding a barrage of luggage.  When she first lays eyes upon Jack, who is on the lower deck with the rest of the `commoners', she has already formed her inferior opinion of him.  It is not until Jack stumbles onto Rose attempting to leap from the aft of the Titanic, and saves her, does she begin to realize that he is not inferior, and instead an interesting man.  Rose soon begins to fall in love with Jack, and this is where we see her change from that `rich bitch' to a caring, lovable woman. We later find out that even though she let go of Jack by the end of the film, she carried the memory of him her entire life through the beautiful necklace she wore as Jack sketched her portrait. 	 Titanic is filled with irony, symbolism, and conflict.  The fact the Jack Dawson won his ticket to ride on Titanic, only to perish on it's very first voyage, is the first taste of irony that we experience.  Also, how heartbreaking is it that just after finding true love, they are split by the death of Jack?  Tragic. 	The greatest use of symbolism in Titanic occurs within the scene where Jack attends the dinner with Rose, Cal, and others.  This represents the life that Rose is bound to, and desperately seeking to escape.  The opposite happens when Jack takes Rose down to the lower deck, and we witness Rose expressing her most comfortable, newfound personality.  We also cannot forget the use of the diamond necklace.  The necklace ultimately represents Roses' undying love for Jack, which she has held onto all her life.  Only after she visits the wreckage of the Titanic is she finally ready to let go, and subsequently releases the necklace to the sea, and passes on in her sleep. 	As with many of James Cameron's films, Titanic uses numerous close up shots to convey intimacy.  A perfect example of this occurs in the scene when Jack is drawing the nude form of Rose.  Another technique that I feel James Cameron has mastered is the use of sound and/or music in his films.  A right sound effect, or musical score as in Titanic, helps to complete that scary slasher scene, or that sad death scene, or even that scene where words just cannot express the right feeling as in that beautiful scene in Titanic when the lifeboat is being lowered with Rose inside. 	The film Titanic is such that in my opinion could be considered as having both a realistic and romantic ending.  The fact that Jack Dawson died at the end makes it a realistic ending; while having Rose walking to the rear of the ship to toss the ever symbolic diamond necklace into the night darkened sea creates the feeling of a romantic ending. 	Titanic proves to not only push the envelope, but break it wide open with the masterful direction by James Cameron.  While Titanic's photography would reason to be realistic, it is by all accounts formalist.   The use of distorted camera angles, wide-angle shots, and camera movements make it such. 	As I earlier stated, the use of a great musical score in any film will make, or break that particular feeling the director wishes to convey.  It is said that realists films employ minimal musical scores, while formalist films come with big scores that are hard to ignore.  Titanic not only has the critically acclaimed `My Heart Will Go On' theme song, but many beautiful scores such as `Rose' and `Southampton' which, in this reviewers opinion, is the main reason this movie was as beautiful as it really was. 	Costuming for Titanic was definitely elaborate and by itself is another reason this film is considered a formalist film. 	Lastly, the way the story and characters unfold is widely considered formalistic.  Formalist films are ones with courageous heroes (Jack) and beautiful women (Rose).  The story in Titanic took place on the biggest and most prestigious ocean liner ever built, which coincides with the fact that formalist films take place in exotic settings.  The only inconsistency that I have encountered with James Cameron's Titanic being measured a formalist film is the fact that it could be said that the film contains two different endings.  The first, by definition, could be considered realist because Jack Dawson ultimately died after the sinking.  Since the older Rose was shown tossing the necklace into the sea, achieving a final internal peace and showing that she is ready to let go and join Jack in the afterlife, it is my opinion this proves that it has a happy ending and hence should be referred to as formalist.",Titanic
210,DavidSim240183,James Cameron's opus is sadly hit and miss,5,8 July 2007,"James Cameron's Titanic was nothing short of a phenomenon. Like so many others, I went to the pictures more than once to catch the must-see film of 1997. When I first saw Titanic, I was swept away by the whole film. I thought it was a thrilling piece of entertainment. Funny, resonant and exciting in equal measure.But again, like so many others I also feel Titanic has lost a bit of its sparkle over the years. Its times like this you ask yourself why a film you once held in such high regard now ranks so low? Lets see if I can answer that question.There's no denying that on the one hand its an impressive piece of filmmaking. Cameron's direction is slick and economical, something that's served him well since his extraordinary debut with The Terminator. The 3 hour running time zips by without one barely noticing. But somewhere along the way, Cameron fumbles it, and like the Titanic, the film goes down with all hands.Cameron is a self-professed Titanic enthusiast, and he's clearly put a great deal of thought, care and precision into recreating the Titanic, from the jumbo sized pistons in the engine room right down to the tiny portholes on the bow. And he exactingly crafts its destruction, first explained to us through a step-by-step computer simulation.The collision with the iceberg. The gradual flooding of the compartments. Loss of power. The ship splits in half. The eventual sinking. And then we finally see it enacted in the last 90 minutes. It would be churlish not to mention how eerily precise Cameron gets the details of the Titanic.Its a shame the human characters aren't as well developed. Cameron's clout in the industry has allowed him to array a truly extraordinary cast. But save one or two, quite a few characters are little more than cardboard cutouts.Kate Winslet shines as Rose. She does quite well and invests a great deal of resourcefulness and spunk into the part of a débutante forced into marriage. Cameron draws a lot of strength and vitality from her character.As for Leonardo DiCaprio, he brings plenty of enthusiasm to Jack Dawson, a penniless artist from steerage. But his romance with Rose never truly convinces. The relationship only works on simplistic terms by pushing all the right emotional buttons. Exactly why it struck such a chord with audiences. Especially the female members. I remember hearing quite a few ladies in the audience reach for their tissues during Jack's rather maudlin death scene.I couldn't go into detail describing how many people there are to keep track of. Otherwise I'd run out of words. The ones that scored favourably with me are Kathy Bates as the unsinkable Molly Brown, Victor Garber as Mr Andrews the ship builder, and in a small but memorable role Jason Barry as Tommy, an Irishman in steerage who meets a tragic end.As for everyone else, they're all one-dimensional. Billy Zane is cast as Rose's fiancée Cal, a snobbish, controlling tyrant. There's no depth to his character. David Warner is wasted in a thankless role as Zane's ghoulish valet, and Frances Fisher takes the prize of worst offender for playing Ruth, Rose's heartless mother.Cameron waits quite a bit before the actual collision. So you'd be forgiven for feeling more than a little restless for the first hour and a half. There are a few moments that stand out. I quite liked the way the film contrasts the differences in 1st and 3rd class, each having dinner in their own way. And you will definitely sit up and pay attention to Jack drawing Rose in the nude wearing nothing but a priceless diamond.But its really after the crash that the film finally starts getting interesting. This is the part of the story Cameron wanted to tell. He stages the destruction of Titanic with breathtaking regard. Corridors flood with cascades of water. The enormity of the hull pivoting into the air is a terrifying sight. Its in these scenes where the film holds a captive audience. Cameron shoots them with a fanatical immediacy, and watching the destruction of these stylised and impeccably crafted sets is awesome to behold.Yet even in these scenes Cameron miscues it a little. The sinking of the Titanic has been filmed many times (A Night To Remember had to have influenced Cameron). But this is the first to add comedy into the mix. I didn't mind so much in the first half because the people aboard didn't know the maiden voyage of Titanic was doomed. But in the second half, when Cameron tries to make you laugh, its an approach at odds with the dramatic thrust of the story, e.g. the aristocrats aboard want brandies while the ship is sinking. This is hardly believable behaviour, and even disrespects the memories of those aboard. It leaves a bad taste in the mouth.Cameron does demonstrate far too much of a willingness to guess what the people aboard were like. Painting them in unfavourable colours, portraying the officers as officious bureaucrats, and even having one of them shooting passengers even when there is no evidence to support that.The final scenes for Jack and Rose go on too long in my opinion. His final words, which are really hackneyed and mawkish belong more in a soap opera, not a multi-million dollar feature film. The image of a floating necropolis is striking though.Titanic is certainly an oddity. Its a film that people embraced as a whole the world over, and now they go out they're way to find fault with it. I didn't go looking for faults. They surfaced as time went by because it just doesn't hold up too well to repeated viewings. I still think you should see Titanic, even if in a few years it probably won't do for you what it used to.",Titanic

216,emperor_bender,Dear God,4,9 May 2008,"This movie right here is ""Overrating"" in its prime.""The most compelling movie of the century"". That's a joke.My question is: Why? Why Cameron? Why did you do it??? You're WAY better than this! But, since Cameron created some cinematic masterpieces like ""The Terminator"" and ""Aliens"", I'm willing to let this one slide. You got lucky this time, Cameron.This movie was nothing but one misplaced drama scene after another. And it wasn't like you could sit through them easily either, this movie was more than 3 hours long! I understand that a lot of people liked this movie, and that maybe I'm being biased, but I really did not like this ""garbage"".Don't get me wrong, there were some very good scenes, and some music score that was decent. But the tear jerker moments grew tiresome quickly. Why are Billy Zane and Bill Paxton wasting their time here? Good scenes and some interesting plot points could not save this mess of a bad drama. I'm sorry, but this Hollywood trash reeks and stains the true story of the Titanic, almost to the point of disgracing it.If you like too much drama and romance badly put together with bad acting by Leonardo DiCaprio, ""Titanic"" is what you want.4/10",Titanic
217,charchuk,"Technically outstanding, but poorly written",6,22 February 2007,"Beautiful to look it, and easy to watch over again, but not necessarily a great film. It is pretty good - mostly because the last 90 minutes or so are fantastic cinema - but it's not particularly well-written or well-acted. The dialogue is often cringe-worthy, and the acting is not that impressive, though that could be due to the dialogue more than the actors. The story is simple enough, but carried out pretty well, and the look of the film is outstanding. All the technical aspects are top-notch, making for a thrilling last half. The first half is no slouch either, though, and I felt the film transitioned nicely from love story to disaster epic. All in all, an entertaining but slightly underwhelming epic.",Titanic
218,roghache,Immortal romance on the doomed ocean liner,9,13 March 2006,"I thoroughly enjoyed this wonderful tale of forbidden love set on history's most famous ocean liner, and believe both the film and its engaging and sympathetic young lovers will go down in the annals of screen legend. All the hype turned out to be a prediction of the movie's calibre, as far as I'm concerned, though some have described it as the movie ""many love to hate"". Of course the film chronicles the tragically brief shipboard romance between Rose, a beautiful, confused young socialite (traveling First Class of course), who is engaged to a suitable but nasty fiancé of her social status, and Jack, the penniless, free spirited young artist traveling in steerage, Third Class. The lead roles are brilliantly portrayed, with electric chemistry, by the lovely Kate Winslet and the dashing young Leonardo diCaprio, both made famous by their roles here. (Pity diCaprio went on to do that foolish modern Romeo + Juliet, a desecration.)As for the romance...yes, it's a moving tale that will endure along with other screen legends. The weaving of the tale of the diamond necklace, the Heart of the Ocean, and Jack's sketch of Rose are interesting story lines. When disaster strikes the ill fated ship, the struggles of Rose and Jack to stay alive are truly gripping. The film's romantic song, ""My Heart Will Go On"", is of course legendary, though I personally am not a tremendous fan of Celine Dion.This movie is not, from my perspective, a historical documentary and I don't take it as such. My knowledge of Titanic history is pretty sketchy, and it wouldn't surprise me if the film contains a few, some, or even many inaccuracies. Still, for me the picture brought to life the spectacle of the extravagant luxury aboard this liner (decor, dining, passengers' attire etc.), the smug, complacent assurance that the ship was unsinkable, the tragedy and surely, eventual terror as the passengers struggled with the inadequate life boats provided and the great White Star liner sank... albeit despite the early refusal to contemplate such a fate, and the band eventually bravely playing on. The final scenes are haunting, hardly a dry eye in the theatre. I feel the fictional romance is interwoven well with the historical details to produce a film that elicits compassion for the unfortunate real victims back in 1912 and would not offend them, were they able to watch it today.The class distinctions are also wonderfully conveyed. One reviewer has complained that the film belabors the greater integrity and friendliness of the lower class, casting the upper class generally in a less flattering light. However, historically let us remember that the lower class passengers were the primary victims, so they would naturally tend to elicit the film makers' (and viewers') sympathies.All in all, an amazing modern spectacle based on a tragic historical event, a touching love story, and overall, a fantastic film.",Titanic
219,theshadow908,An epic film.,9,15 September 2006,"Titanic is the most famous ""fictional story tied into real event"" movie to date. It tells the story of a poor man who wins tickets to board the Titanic in a poker game. He and his friend board the ship in hopes of reaching New York City and starting life anew. While on board, he falls for a rich woman who is set to be married. After he saves her life, she begins to fall for him, and a passionate love story begins. However, their plans are halted abruptly when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink. Now it's a race against time to try and get off the ship as soon as possible.I don't care what anyone has to say about this movie. Sure, the first hour is chick flick material, and it features the clichéd rich girl/poor boy formula, but this movie is so well made, well acted, and well directed, that it deserves all the praise it gets. The movie has a 3 hour running time, but it's never really slow. Even in the sappy scenes, you're drawn in by the amazing set around the characters. James Cameron did a great job directing this movie. The recreation of the interior of the Titanic is amazing. It's like they're filming inside the real ship. Though the first hour is mainly a love story, it still can keep the guys entertained because it's not a long drawn out drama. Cameron keeps amazing balance between continuing the love story and telling the story of the disaster in the second half of the film. The sinking scenes are fantastic. Finally, the most accurate portrayal of the Titanic's demise on film. This movie has drama, action, and some comedy. It manages to tell a great story and be a highly entertaining action film at the same time.The performances are very good. Not one performance in this movie is flawed. Everybody involved is extremely talented and they all do very well in their parts.Overall, despite what anyone says about this movie, it doesn't change the fact that it's an epic film with a great story and amazing visuals.9/10",Titanic

But that doesn't alter the fact that it's probably one of the grandest films of all time, and to spite you non-believers, I might add that it will become a classic, much like Gone with the Wind - and there's nothing you can do about it...The performance of Winslet and DiCaprio lifts the dialogue, and the entire scenery is so magnificent there's none to match it. As for detail and Cameron's eye for excesses, I don't think there was one single penny lost to this film. All of it bears a sensation of reality that is just WAY above anything else I've encountered.I've enjoyed Cameron's films for several years, and it saddens me to think that this man had to make a drama (albeit the best of dramas) to be recognized as the great director he is.

The special effects are enormous and the interaction between Leonardo and Kate is one of a rare breed (and no I am not a Leonardo-fan at all...).

Maybe a few years earlier or later the impact to society would have been less big or even bigger? anyway it influenced a whole generation and even a decade later it has not lost a single spark. It's still the one and only benchmark for any movie. Titanic inspires young and old, brings everyone with a heart to tears and impresses with the highest level of detail in movie making. I'm so thankful I was part of the premiere and the re-screening.
Titanic delivers the perfect 10 on all levels. The attention to detail, eg the dishes and furniture have been all recreated 1:1 to the original. The cast, Katy Bates & esp Kate Winslet (who, in my opinion was shockingly robbed to win her 1st academy award. Alone for heart breaking deleted scene where she had a mental breakdown was one of the best performances by any actress !) and then of course the score: haunting & epic.

Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor boy living in Europe, well just sort of hanging out in Europe in 1912. Outside the bar he hangs in, the largest ship ever built, the Titanic, is being set to sail. After winning an unbelievable card hand, he wins a ticket aboard and to America.While Jack camps out on the 3rd Level, Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is spending some rough time on the 1st Level.

Jack convinces her not to jump and the two begin to spend some time together and slowly fall in love. But as the days slowly tick away an unknown obstruction stands in front of ship, just a few miles ahead. One obstruction that would set the ship into history.The film beautifully shot and wonderfully acting. The love story is better then most. Instead of two kids just meeting and having sex that night, Cameron took time to let both Jack and Rose develop and progress into the relationship. The dialog between the two flows easily and the love connection is strong and well-portrayed. The special effects are a bit overwhelming especially when the ship is sinking. My only fault with the film is its length. I don't have a problem when a film extends 3+ hours when necessary but this extending 3 was unnecessary. Too many scenes are shown of Billy Zane running around and could have been edited out. Other than that the film is perfect. The story is told with great detail and flows less like a history lesson and more like a love story. The film is quite gripping and overwhelming at some parts but is well-worth seeing.Titanic.

229,nickmesafilms,Titanic (1997) - I'm the King of the World!!!!!!!!!!!,10,21 May 2011,"Remember the world's most heartbreaking moment, the sinking of the Titanic? Well, memories come back to us when the incredible James Cameron and his big imagination create a powerful love story disaster. The film is a fictional love story, taking place in a historical event. Set to the sinking of the Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio plays a poor man named Jack, who falls in love with a rich woman named Rose, portrayed by Kate Winslet. Although separated by the number of money in their pockets, that does not stop the love between each other. Then, when Titanic begins to sink, sacrifices are being made, and Jack would do anything in his power to make Rose safe. James Cameron let out his heart into this movie, and really wanted to express his feelings on the sinking. Though the film is sad, and maybe too graphic, the film was a beautiful masterpiece portrayed by an amazing cast, a great direction, an amazing re-creation of history, brilliant costumes, breathtaking art direction, scene-stealing sound effects, visionary film editing, and exhilarating visual effects. I watch the movie over and over again and never got tired of enjoying it, cause it will never leave your heart. I'll never forget watching this movie, and I'll respect that it won the Best Picture on my birth year, and glad it made a billion dollars in the box office. This movie will always be epic and romantic in every way. This is a visual marvel, but it also has great characters and a terrific story to go along with it. ""Titanic"", in my review, ""a beautiful masterpiece of the heart, something to enjoy watching over and over.""Oh, and speaking of the 3D re-release, it's worth your money! Even if this movie was made in 1997, James Cameron is one of those filmmakers that knows how to make perfect use of the 3-D, and he makes it look like the movie was made in 3-D. Even if you wish that James Cameron should have cut the film 20 minutes shorter, you still believe that every single detail that James Cameron added, had to be there in the movie. The 3-D literally draws you into the adventure, frankly because this is the type of 3-D that is used perfectly, just like in ""Avatar"".

And not caring.And this story line really doesn't mean anything because she has the diamond the whole time and doesn't tell them, for some reason, throws it into the water, for some reason and then dies I'm assuming, for some reason. So having Rose tell the story in modern times doesn't amount to anything. The only thing about showing Rose older is to show that she lived a good life like Jack wanted but they don't really go onto that all that much.The best thing this movie does is make you feel for the people who were actually on the ship and do justice to what they went through. And does a really good job of including real people without making anyone look bad. You even see where the people who made bad decisions were coming from.",Titanic

Where to start? Acting? Where? Corny? Hey, Iowa aint got this much in a year. Shallow? A nickel couldn't have sunk in this thing. One word summation? EMBARRASSING.

232,gpeevers,Nice Love Story with A Great Backdrop,7,16 April 2019,"Neither as good or as bad as the hype might have led me to believe.The love story is good and the special effects are good, but considering the material Cameron was working with he didn't really produce anything that another director might have with a similarly astronomical budget or possibly a whole lot less.This is definitely a film for the big screen or at least the biggest screen you have.",Titanic
233,TheHonestCritic,"This ""film"" is a failure of truly ""Titanic"" proportions!",4,8 June 2020,"""Titanic"" (1997), okay, before you all freak out and get enraged, I will say this. James Cameron has a boatload of talent (NO PUN INTENDED), as a writer and a director. He has written and directed some phenomenal films! But, ""Titanic"" in my opinion, is by far his worst movie. It has an overlong and convoluted storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a dull cliched soundtrack. This ""film"" is 195 minutes in length. Now, the length of a movie can make or break it. I don't mind a long movie if the storyline keeps me hooked all the way through. The basic plot behind this ""film"" is that there's a love story and the Titanic sinks. A simple story like this should warrant 100-120 minutes max to express the storyline. Film Making 101: if you're planning on making a lengthy film, then you better be sure that you know what you're doing. Just because a movie is long, does not always guarantee it's going to be good. Remember the cardinal rule: less is more! You always want to leave your audience asking for more in the end. Therefore, your storyline will have a stronger impact. As for the acting, it's overall disappointing from all of the actors and actresses. However, there are two standouts though. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose are the only two that seem to actually be trying. Both of them are great actors! But, a poorly written storyline impeded them from truly giving it their all and allowing them to shine. Such a shame! Both of these two actors, along with the majority of the rest of the cast are great actors and actresses in other movies. What's their excuse here? Finally, the soundtrack is just a cliched, dull and predictable mess. However, there is one standout song from the score that isn't too bad. The song, ""My Heart Will Go On"" written by James Horner and then performed by Celine Dion is actually well-done. As for the rest of the music in this ""film"", it's just generic and boring. There are only two positives in this ""movie"", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. The Titanic set is very well constructed and the rest of the locations give this ""film"" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects were well-done and still hold up today. ""Titanic"" is a boring and lengthy ""movie"". Probably one of the worst things about it is that you know what's going to happen in the end right from the beginning. Talk about spoiling your own film! Sorry, James Cameron..... ""Titanic"" is just nothing but a jumbled mess. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Don't bother watching ""Titanic"", I don't care how much a film makes at the box office. Just because a movie makes a lot of money doesn't always mean it's automatically going to be a masterpiece. Awards mean nothing, because at the end of the day, what's most important is what you think. I just wish I could get those 195 minutes of my life back!",Titanic
234,dockerykelli,Such an AMAZING Film,10,27 June 2019,Titanic was such a wonderful movie!!! It accurately portrayed how the ship sunk to begin with. The storyline behind it all including the CAST!!! A+++ Film,Titanic
235,bluesman-20,they said God himself couldn't sink her.,10,24 February 2010,James Cameron's masterpiece a movie that has Almost everything in it love romance Heroism and sacrifice and unbridled Evil. And the best part most of it is true. Cameron's Titanic is a fictional story told from the most part between two tragic lovers Rose Dewitt and Jack Dawson. Winslet and Decaprio deliver career making performances here. I had been impressed with Decaprio from What's eating Gilbert Grape and discovered this young man can act He stole a movie from Johnny Depp not a easy thing to do. But anyways. Rose is going to be forced into a loveless marriage to a heartless millionaire wonderfully played in a sleazy manner by Billy Zane. Rose's Mother was once married to a man who was once Rich but spent all the money and Died on them leaving them only a name some social connections and a mountain of debt. So Rose must marry a detestable man for his money. In fact once they reach America they will be married. Jack Dawson is a drifter and a dreamer who goes where the wind blows him and the wind gives him a ticket to the third class passenger section of Titanic. Jack is a artist who cares for the adventure of life. Things happen when he rescues Rose from a suicide attempt and she introduces him to her world and discovers they will not make a place for Jack in their world he is beneath them. Jack introduces her to his world and she discovers people who are dirt poor but Rich in other ways They are so alive and vibrant and she discovers within herself the strength to move beyond matters of wealth and social standing. However Rose's Mother and her groom to be have discovered that Rose has fallen for Jack and all their planning in now in danger. Then comes the unthinkable the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to flood. The Captain is given the dire news in an hour all of this will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. the news is met with horror skeptics scoff at the idea of the unsinkable Titanic sinking and the people are now drawn into battles of classes first class passengers first all others after. Jack and Rose struggle to survive the death of Titanic and to try to find some meaning after the ship has died and gone down to the bottom of the ocean. There is a beginning story that frames the entire movie involving men and women diving on Titanic looking for treasure and getting involved with old Rose who tells the story. But the Real story here is Cameron's dedication to detail he spent fives years diving on the Titanic and interviewing survivors his quest for accuracy was an obsession that paid off Big. I took my wife to see this movie back when it had just been released and I groaned thru the romance and I laughed at the end when Dicaprio's Heroic Jack Dawson makes a big sacrifice in fact my wife called me a caveman with no feelings. However 13 years later I saw the film on TV again and watched it from the beginning and I Caught all of it. And I understood it better now that all the hype has died down and the Cult of Decaprio has quietly gone away that this movie is a human tragedy and that love knows no boundaries and that somethings should always be remembered no matter how painful. James Cameron created a masterpiece and maybe the movie by which he will always be remembered.,Titanic
236,henrycoles9,Greatest movie of all time,10,4 November 2020,"Flawless, enchanting, riveting, wondrous, totally out of this world. Astounding as this may sound, I've just now got around to watching ""Titanic,"" 23 years on, and I'm staggered at all that I've missed my whole life.Young love is the most wonderful theme to explore in a movie, but it's also the most difficult to depict beautifully and without too much cloying treacle. Couple that with the story of a young teenage girl in the bygone era of aristocrat families and arranged marriage, side saddles and corsets, outrageous class inequality and rich powerful men in control of everything and keeping women under their thumbs - and you get ""Titanic."" And James Cameron, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cracked it with a bang! They impressed. They dazzled. They shined.They took our breath away.",Titanic
237,brenttraft,Masterpiece Theater Meets The Poseidon Adventure,9,26 September 2004,"I finally saw Titanic when it was on network television last week. I had been avoiding it because I didn't think I would like it. I hadn't liked any of James Cameron's other films and I didn't think I would be able to make it through the entire 3 hours. The first half was like a Merchant-Ivory production and it was much better than I expected. The second half was basically a remake of the Poseidon Adventure and it was pretty much what I expected.My favorite part of the film did not involve any of the lead characters. It was when the boat was about to sink and the string quartet had finished their last piece of music. They said their goodbyes and started walking away, then the violinist started playing solo. The other members came back and joined him. This part of the film showed that the musicians knew they had nowhere else to go because they were going to die. While most of the other passengers were panicking, the musicians chose to die doing what they loved most.That one touching scene made the movie worthwhile for me. While I don't consider it a great film and it is way too long, it is much better than I ever thought James Cameron was capable of. 7/10",Titanic
238,flingebunt,Icebergs anyone,8,4 March 2005,"The Irish plans to tow an iceberg to Belfast to commemorate the making of the Titanic seems a good enough reason to write a review of this movie.So here is the spoiler of this review. They build this big ship, they think it is unsinkable, it hits an icebergs and sinks. (Other breaking news, the earth is round, Christopher Columbus fails to get to India but discovers America).The true genius of this film is that it understands that movies take us to another place that we could not normally go but where we have a desire, either openly or secretly, to venture.We have all heard of the Titanic and how it sank. But do we really know what it would be like to be there, in the ""ruddy"" north Atlantic as the largest and safest ship sinks beneath you? James Cameron uses two methods to make this come alive. Firstly, and the most obvious are the sets and special effects. A full size tilt-able Titanic and CGI. Even though the CGI looks look computer graphics it is good enough to mean we don't really need to worry about it (I am sure in a few years they will run the computer models through better software and knock out a better print so Titanic fans can buy the Titanic experience all over again).The other technique is to create 2 fictitious characters that we care about who he put anywhere he wants during the sinking process so that we can really feel what is happening and meet many real people and see their stories.The movie is 3 hours long, but once the Titanic starts sinking you become involved in that part of the story as if it is a story starting afresh and your attention doesn't waver from that moment on.Overblown, pretentious film making that won the Oscar because that is what American films want to be. However it remains highly entertaining.",Titanic
239,renegadeviking-271-528568,Fun film,8,24 November 2018,"This movie may or may not stand the test of time. Its theory of why the ship went down has since been replaced by a discussion of the fire down below. Its most indulgent moments have become the stuff of parody. But if we're going to judge this film, let's judge it by its impact on release. I saw it seven times before it left the theater. I was entranced by it. The performances were stunning, as was the cinematography and direction. It's a great story, about the folly of human beings and the absolute imperative of living your life while you've got breath in your lungs. I loved the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet, but there were great performances as well from Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher and Gloria Stuart. I loved the use of music. I loved the whole thing. After you watch a film 900 times, you lose sight of what was great about it and all that remains is its imperfections. This was still a great ride.",Titanic
240,dy158,One of my all-time favourites. Yes.,9,19 June 2006,"When I say that, I am not kidding anyone. Had I knew it earlier, I will have posted my review here beforehand. I had watched it once when it was at the cinemas here (and someone I know actually watched more than once!), watched twice or something when it was on the television here. The last time was like few years back on the television.It goes to show how much I so love the movie, despite some may think now it's cheesy to bring it up. Hey, this was a box office winner and it's still at the top here in terms of ticket earnings for an opening release of a movie, from what I know. And whenever I heard Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On', I will almost become a drama mama. Literally.Interstingly, I first remembered back then some years back in my school days, I was doing a comprehension passage about the cruise liner prior to the movie's release and the thing at that time, I had never thought much about the comprehension passage I did after that. I had never thought that it will become a big blockbuster of the time few years later it came out. Till I (even) begged my family that I wanted to go watch it at the cinema (which it happened). I know it's all fiction in the movie about the love story of Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCapirio) before watching it.The entire movie setting is almost perfect and it will almost bring you back of the era when the actual cruise liner had its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York. Even as I was watching each time, I had often wished I am boarding a luxury cruise liner (still waiting for that day). Anyone can dream.I have to kind of admit, interestingly, I never cried (but just felt deeply moved then) towards the end of the movie when I first saw it but subsequently when it was on the television here, tears almost started to come out of my eyes.Almost a real perfect masterpiece. Just don't care what others will say.",Titanic
241,Chris_Pandolfi,A New Dimension for Cameron's Ship of Dreams,9,16 April 2012,"The recent trend of converting old films to 3D and rereleasing them theatrically has kept me in an almost constant state of recollection. The experience of seeing James Cameron's ""Titanic 3D"" has put me back into that state, and for the time being, it ranks as the most vivid, the most powerful, and the most personal of any 3D rerelease I've seen. It called to mind my days as a teenage ""Titanic"" historian (very much of the amateur division) and, to an even stronger degree, my talent for drawing, which I sadly gave up on. Most of all, it called to mind memories of seeing the film for the first time in December of 1997 and watching it win the Oscar for Best Picture and become the most financially successful movie ever made – only to be surpassed twelve years later by ""Avatar,"" again directed by James Cameron.Fifteen years have passed, and my interest in the ship itself has dimmed. For the purposes of watching the 3D rerelease, this is actually a good thing; I was now better able to appreciate the film on narrative and emotional levels. As a fourteen-year-old, I responded mainly to its technical aspects, not the least of which was the work that went into recreating the ship. Cameron strove for excruciating detail, and it paid off. With a combination of full-sized set replicas, various scale models, and computer generated imagery, he brought the ship back to life. I still respond to all this as a twenty-eight-year-old, but now I see so much more, namely how the film is a beautiful and engrossing romantic melodrama. Each character fits so neatly into an archetype that they all seem to belong within the pages of a beloved storybook.This is one of the few films I've seen in which so many individual shots resonate with power. A few are sweeping and majestic, as when the camera pulls back from Leonardo DiCaprio standing on the railing at the prow of the ship; it rises up, zooming above the bridge and the sun deck, cuts through a plume of smoke billowing from one of the funnels, and continues until it passes the stern, at which point we watch it momentarily sailing off onto the horizon. Most are haunting, as when the ship has already sank and Kate Winslet surfaces for air; the camera pulls back from her, gradually revealing a sea of hapless passengers screaming and fighting to stay afloat in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic.The list goes on. There's the moment when the camera quickly zooms backwards down a hallway as water rushes in, casing doors to fly off their hinges. There's the first shot of the massive rudder and propellers emerging from the water as the ship sinks bow-first. There's the scene where torrents of water finally break through the glass dome over the Grand Staircase. There's the shot of a steerage passenger comforting her children with a religious fable as they lie in bed, for she knows that they never had a chance at making it off the sinking ship alive. There are the ship's final death throes, beginning when it dramatically breaks in two and ending with the stern briefly floating on the water vertically, the passengers falling and bumping against railings. And then there's the scene in which a lifeboat rows through a sea of frozen bodies. We immediately take notice of a mother clutching her infant to her chest.That the film is a triumph of sheer spectacle, there can be no question. I knew that back in 1997. What I gradually picked up on over years of home viewings, and what I finally realized upon seeing it once again on the big screen, is just how good this movie is at being a love story. ""Titanic"" is high romance in the best possible sense – a tale of star-crossed lovers and secrets that stay buried in time, only to be uncovered by outside forces. I've been critical of Cameron's screen writing skills, specifically in regards to dialogue, for which he has a tin ear; in the case of ""Titanic,"" part of the charm is that the dialogue is as overtly theatrical as the plot. You listen to the characters talk and know you're being immersed in a style that's intended to be heightened and old-fashioned.Apart from the fact that we've now reached the centennial of the ship's sinking, the main selling point of this rerelease is, of course, the 3D. The process has its moments of effectiveness; the best-looking scenes are the ones with rows of people standing at various distances from the camera. But in general, the new 3D effects don't generate a significant sense of depth, and the brightness is noticeably reduced. The most disappointing scenes, in terms of dimension, are the sinking and the present-day expedition of the wreck. I understand Cameron's enthusiasm for 3D, which he has been vocal about, although I wonder if he realizes that he already had a masterpiece and that the conversion was unnecessary. I didn't need an extra dimension to appreciate ""Titanic 3D."" The story, the characters, and the technical authenticity are more than enough.-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)",Titanic

243,Herag,"One small step for a moviemaker, a gaint step for the Moviekind.",9,16 July 2003,"A kid who was a loner and strived on doing things different and better, grew up to be an A-Director and in Hollywood, that is a great achievement just to be in that league, the man is James Cameron and the movie is Titanic.From the Screenplay to the the ultimate Audio dubbing at the Lucas's Skywalker technology park-Cameron's genius clearly shines. If there was another person who can share the credit would be James Horner. The music comes alive with the sea parting for the ocean liner. The initial departing scene in Southhamton and the the working of the engines with the sound of the pistons going fullboard ""Let us strech our legs Mr. Murdoch"" is just awesome scenes to reckon with. The sea is alive with the sound of Titanic. The scene with Rose shivering on the plank of wood is probably the weakest part of Cameron's directorial brilliance. The scene is short and plastic. Gloria Stuart as the surviving ""Rose"" reminds me of Katherine Hepburn in her sincere portrayal.Like ""Ben-Hur"", this is a movie that will be remembered as long as the relic of Titanic remains in the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.",Titanic
244,martymaster,Love story mixed together with a big tragedy.,7,14 August 2001,"James Cameron has done a good job making one of the centuries big block busters.He has used the tragic titanic accident as the background and mixed in a great love story about a poor kid and a rich women. This is really a big budget movie and it is not hard to figure out why,because they had to build everything new and some of the fx when the boat sinks are just amazing. The plot of the movie is not very deep and the 3 hours goes by like 2 hours and 50min. We must not forget that this is a BIG tragedy and that the love story is just fiction.It is not one of my favourit movies, but I have to give James Camron credit for making a big budget movie like this.If you are a guy between 15 and 30 I advice you to go and pick up a die hard movie instead.But if you are a girl or women then this is a must.Ps:I did actually see some boys coming crying out of the cinema.",Titanic

There are however, major problems with Titanic. (its NOT un-sinkable !!) The two leads Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio cant sustain a hot romance throughout the entire movie...indeed the chemistry is never quite right between the two.(Di Caprio in particular is ""out of his depth"" here) Both actors (even apart from the relationship problem) are not at their best. Perhaps the gigantic nature of the project ""got to them"".The supporting cast play this...like they are on a ship that will hit a huge ice berg. The dialogue is another problem. It lacks any feeling or spontaneity, and some of the language sounds too modern.

247,akash_sebastian,An All-time Classic! An Epic Disaster movie...,9,9 April 2012,"This James Cameron's ambitious venture is a cinematic masterpiece which is easily the most meticulously rendered and relentless disaster movie ever made.Though it has various clichés and flaws, and may deviate from what actually happened that night, people should remember this it's not a historic or biographic movie; it's a fictional epic love story with the historic setting of the sinking of the Titanic. Some may say, the two main characters so easily & neatly fall in love in such a short period of time or that the division between the social classes is exaggerated... But the amazing acting by the long list of talented actors, James Cameron's brilliant direction, Russell Carpenter's elegant cinematography and production designer Peter Lamont's intricate recreation of the ship truly bring the story to life, help us overlook the minor shortcomings and makes us all fall in love with it.*** SPOILERS ***Over the years, it's effect on me might have changed. Earlier, it was the disaster and the deaths which affected me. Now, the various characters and their journeys just make me think... - Rose, who was bored of meaningless aristocratic life, finds a purpose and new meaning when she meets Jack. With his help, she finally gets the courage to cut her ties from that high-society world. Even after Jack dies, she keeps her promise and explores other fields, becomes an actress, marries, and goes on to live for over 80 years. - Jack, who has been to many places studying people and drawing them, meets a complex rich girl and falls for her. - Cal Hockley, who is used having whatever he sets his eyes upon, couldn't bare it when he realizes that his fiancée, Rose, is slowly slipping through his hands. In the end, he becomes so frustrated that he even starts shooting at them. - There are so many other such interesting characters, from the architect who feels guilty that he wasn't able to design a strong ship and decides to die along with it, the captain who after 26 years of experience feels remorse for not taking his last voyage's ship safely to shore, to the crew member who shoots two people for creating a chaos and finally killing himself not able to bear what he had just done.*** END of SPOILERS ***And who can forget the last one hour of the film involving the sinking? It has been shot and executed quite brilliantly.Unfortunately, people love to comment negatively about something good, because they are unable to think for themselves and have a need to be accepted in their 'clique'.

248,aramis-112-804880,Monumental Waste,3,6 June 2018,"The real history of ""Titanic"" (some of which is touched on in this mess) is a compelling story. While this flick might be ""Romeo and Juliet"" at sea, I found the whole shebang was at sea.The good thing is, ""Titanic"" is full of fine actors. From David Warner to Bernard Fox, right through Jonathan Hyde and even soap star Eric Braeden. The bad thing is, we don't see enough of them.What we get is an awful lot of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. If either of those two (if you'll pardon the pun) ""float your boat"" then you're on easy street. I can't stand either of them and unfortunately what should have been a mawkish subplot is the mawkish major storyline (the ""Trivia"" item that Leonardo's part was offered to Johnny Depp and he declined practically broke my heart). I tried making it through this gargantuan waste of celluloid with the lovers; then I tried fast forwarding through scenes of those two infernal bores . . . and realized I was losing nearly all the movie. There was no escaping them!The movie's major flaw (apart from casting those two simps as the leads) is that the major part of the movie, set in 1912, doesn't really gel with the ""modern"" scenes. Furthermore, not for a moment did I buy Gloria Stuart as an older Kate Winslet. I assume that idea, which was presented up front and so isn't a spoiler, was carried on through the movie. I don't know because I was simply unable to finish watching ""Titanic."" It was BORING. Fortunately I was watching on VHS tapes I picked up for free at a book sale. It was on two tapes and I never bothered putting the second one in. I suppose that's where all the real drama and big effects come in, but the first half was so tedious I saw no reason to bother with the rest. After all, I know what happened to the ship in the end, though I won't reveal it here.It's too bad because I was something of a ""Titanic"" buff in high school. Therefore, I was able to spot little historical errors. I also hate historical movies and tv shows where some familiar actor is introduced briefly as a real person and then the fictional (i.e., phony) story rolls on--in this case, the affair between Leonardo and Kate.Perhaps it's a curse, but no really good movie has been made about ""Titanic."" the one with Clifton Webb was too soap operaish and had a silly ending. The one with Kenneth More tried to be fairly accurate with information known at the time (now all blown to bits by the discovery of the ship itself). This one is not really about ""Titanic."" It's about the love story, and is worthy of any 1970s disaster movie. It could be set on the Poseidon, in a Towering Inferno, or on Krakatoa. All I know is, it seemed to go on and on and on until little bits of me started dropping off. If I'd been on ""Titanic"" with those two I'd have gone down with the ship.Perhaps people were drawn to this the same way they were to the practically endless ""Doctor Zhivago"" in the 1960s, for a fiery love story (at that time) set against a great historical backdrop. Too bad Omar Sharif wasn't the lover in this one. At least he's always been good for a few laughs. But Kate Winslet is no Julie Christie. And why should she be? She was bad enough in ""Hamlet.""Overall, this must be the most overrated monster in the history of the talkies. It was supposed to be about the tragedy of ""Titanic"" with all its needlessly lost lives, yet I was reminded of the line of Oscar Wilde about a work of Dickens: ""One must have a heart of stone to read the death of little Nell without laughing."" But ""Titanic"" doesn't even have enough hoots in it to make it as watchable as ""Plan Nine from Outer Space."" Just because something is popular doesn't make it good.",Titanic

251,stormhawk2021,Bravo,10,20 June 2017,"Titanic is a movie I've seen countless times since I was a little kid and it came out. This movie is one that seems to polarize people to extremes. Some love it and will call it one of the best movies they've seen and others will hate it and label it one of the worst. As far as where I stand on it today, I still believe it is a very good film that benefits from marvelous special effects. Jack wins his way onto the Titanic in a poker game and runs into first class rich girl, Rose, when she is hanging off the end of the ship, apparently about to commit suicide. Jack saves her and they start spending a lot of time together, which really pisses off Rose's rich, but unpleasant fiancé, Cal Hockley. The story is told by the 102 year old Rose, as treasure seeker Brock Lovett searches for a diamond that was given to Rose by Cal on the boat. The movie has its share of problems. The dialogue, at times, can be corny, as can the actions. The acting, while serviceable most of the time, has some terrible moments, especially from Billy Zane and Bill Paxton. Also, the film suffers slightly from its long run time. It's not something that bothers me a great deal, but had the film been cut by something like 20 or 30 minutes, it would have flowed a lot better. Titanic isn't James Cameron's best film, but it is a majestic and epic one. I like Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose, and I also really liked Kathy Bates as a first class passenger that has just come into her money. This isn't one of the best films ever, but it's, at times, fun, sad, infuriating, and joyful. There's an emotional roller-coaster going on here.",Titanic
252,tburke85,Titanic A Long But Well Made Tragic Adventure Love Story,8,13 June 2009,"Titanic is a long but well made tragic adventure love story that takes place during the ill-fated voyage on the unsinkable ship. Writer/Director James Cameron has done a great job of making this movie about a fictional love story between two very different people and combining that with the real event of the Titanic that sunk after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912 claiming thousands of lives who perished in the icy freeing waters of the North Atlantic. The two leads in the film are great in their roles including Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They make for a good on-screen couple. DiCpario and Winslet also had genuine chemistry together which made the romance that eventually blossoms between them that much more believable. They both showed real talent when this one came out and both of them have continued to show just that in their most recently films as well. The rest of the supporting cast including Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Jonathan Hyde, and Bill Paxton in a small role are equally impressive as their characters who help bring them to life in this film. The love story, the action, suspense, and the special effects are magnificent done especially for that time. The horror of the situation the characters were in felt so real because it really happened making you want most of them to survive this life and death situation. The pacing was a little slow at times and it was a little long but the rest of the movie made up for it's few flaws. Titanic makes for a great date movie which is sure to make some girls cry almost every time they watch it. The fact that this really happened definitely added to the movie making you feel sorry for all the lives lost when the Titanic sunk into the Atlantic after hitting an iceberg. Overall Titanic is a tragic heartbreaking story about two people who fall in love while on the ill-fated ship thats brought to life by the exceptional performances from the cast especially DiCaprio and Winslet who definitely make this movie worth the time to watch.",Titanic
253,revival05,This is Hollywood at it's top,8,17 May 2000,"I'm not really sure why so many people hated this movie, but I've got a few theories:1. Leonardo DiCaprio (I can agree, but he wasn't that bad)2. Jealousy against Leonardo DiCapro (Guys, c'mon, admit it)3. It was a drama (some teenager probably hated it just because it was a lovestory, I know a few)4. They don't want to get swallowed by the hype5. They're against Hollywood6. They can't stand too long moviesOr maybe it's the classic one: They hate it, just because everybody else did it.Well, here's my comment (and I am a guy, and I'm not fag):Finally a big bang here from Hollywood. A 3 hour epic with remarkable special effects. Another example is BEN-HUR, hey same amount of Oscars!!Well now. I first saw this movie, when it came and I was amazed! I mean, wow! It was entertaining, thrilling and even though you knew the plot and storyline (the ship will sink, hope THATS not a spoiler) you were kept at your seat, because you didn't want to miss a thing, and you just had to find out what was going to happen. And what about this crankiness against the script. It is a classic setup. Three acts (the story actually stops at about every hour so I'm not that out of here) , the beginning with the proud ship and the glorious ''first class' and some character-presentations, the middle where the ship hits the ice and the worrying starts while some characters gets developed, and the final act wich is an hour of thrilling action and glorious special effects! I have NEVER IN MY LIFE witness such a simple but so genius storyline! And I can't understand those who wasn't impressed.OK, the acting might not be as great as it maybe should. DiCaprio is the obvious choose to get money, but he's not the right kid, and the worst part is HE FIT'S IN (might sound a bit strange). Winslet was good, but BILLY ZANE was the best! I just loved that character. I ''almost'' laughed in every scene in he was in. James Cameron here shows that he can make any genre (but the action is his top), and of course Bill Paxton hangs along too.This might not be THE BEST movie ever made, but it is definitively one of my semi-finalists! 9/10",Titanic
254,The_Core,Still works for me...,9,26 March 2002,"Well, it's been a year since my last review of this film (this is review #3).  I saw ""Titanic"" on the big screen in 1997, and bought the DVD when it came out (which I still watch from time to time, maybe about twice/year).""Titanic"" still works for me as an epic spectacle and blockbuster.  The love story is OK, I don't really care... this is the movie to watch for eye candy and epic scope, not emotion.  I never did get caught up in any sobby or sentimental emotions with this film.  The overall story isn't bad... yes, some of the lines are cheesy and the dialog is corny, so what?  The low point of the film has to be DiCaprio sinking beneath the waves... not sad at all to me, but so what?""Titanic"" stands as a fabulous spectacle and a great movie watching experience.  The years have not diminished that in the least, and the special effects couldn't be done any better today than they were in 1997. The nit-pickers are still picking, 'sentimentalists' are still getting outraged at the 'realists' bashing the film, and I'm still sitting back and enjoying a couple times a year a film that was highly overrated at the Oscars (so what else is new) but where every penny of the budget shows on the screen... the spectacle of it... the scope, it can sweep you away.  Turn your brain off, turn the lights down, and enjoy on the biggest possible screen.9/10 pieces of popcorn from this 38 year old male.",Titanic
255,The_Core,"Still a ""Titanic"" movie!",9,30 May 2000,"Well here it is, three years after the release of Titanic, and the movie is still eminently watchable.  I have the DVD version, and watch it occasionally.  I've come to realize that the love story (which MANY have complained about) serves to offset the ""disaster"" portion of the movie *perfectly*.  Without it, watching ""Titanic"" would simply be a bleak and depressing experience.  But notice how the love story reaches its peak JUST as the ship crashes into the iceberg, and a crossover effect is achieved -- disaster intersects with love and the human spirit.  Without the love story (and no, I didn't think it was particularly cheesy), Titanic would not be the movie that it is.People have said that this movie has ""aged"" poorly since its original release.  I don't think so.  I saw it three times on the big screen when it came out, and bought the DVD when *it* first came out.  Multiple viewings have not diminished this movie for me.  It still stands as the finest movie of 1997, and the best epic disaster film ever made.  Remember, this movie is not a documentary, and was never intended to be.  Some people don't quite seem to get that point.  As for Leonardo Dicaprio, I do feel they could have chosen a different actor for the part and it would have improved things, but only a little.  This film has only one lead character, the Titanic Herself. All the rest are extras, albeit important ones.If you're one of those rare birds who hasn't seen ""Titanic"" yet, don't listen to its detractors.  Watch the movie and judge it for yourself.  I won't comment on the special effects, except to say they're incredible and 99% seamless.  The story (taken as a whole) is profound and moving.  No other disaster film (the innumerable ""Airport 19xx's"" and others) have managed to capture the human side of a major 20th century disaster so effectively.  And this is still a great 'date movie' as well.  It succeeds from many, many angles -- so many that its flaws (yes, it has some) can and should be overlooked.  Director James Cameron put his heart and soul into this film, and it shows.Verdict: Acquitted on ALL charges and rated 9/10 for true excellence in filmmaking.",Titanic
256,The_Core,"Hype, schmipe!",9,30 January 2001,"Many have commented recently that ""Titanic"" was overrated/overhyped, some even saying it was ""the most overhyped movie in history"" (somehow I doubt that... perhaps Waterworld might take that prize, or maybe Independence Day or Jurassic Park).Anyway, what makes no sense to me is this... why haven't you shaken off the hype yet?  The movie isn't playing in theaters anymore, it isn't being hyped up anywhere.  So can't you just put in in your DVD player/VCR/whatever and watch it for what it is?  I mean, that's all it ever was anyway, 'hype' is just 'consensus conditioning' and you don't have to be affected by it at all unless you choose to.That said, I maintain my stance that 'Titanic' is still a great, entertaining film, that it was never meant to be a documentary (and would have suffered greatly without the tension-relieving love-story subplot), and my agreement that DiCaprio was a poor choice for the male lead.Anyway... I can put the DVD in every once in awhile, sit back and watch this movie for what it shows me... the 'hype' was forgotten over three years ago. And I like the film.  If you don't like the film, fine, but quit complaining about it being overhyped and/or overrated.  Do you still remember the weather the day the film was released, too?",Titanic
257,zac-04879,"A True Classic Belonging at the Top of the ""Epic"" Genre",8,13 September 2021,"The film masters in fictionalising a firm love tale and gently pressing it in between a beautifully intense reenactment of the Titanic's disastrous tragedy. Although it's not what you'd class as a romantic thriller, it's incredibly romantic and very thrilling; audiences will specifically admire just the romance, the thrills, or both! And within a runtime of 3 hours, James Cameron portrays the fluently-designed story in a way that never gets boring, constantly moves swiftly, and remains a true classic.The first half of the movie portrays a fictional but a very solid and tragic love story. Most romance movies that end in tragedy are ones where one of the lead lovers die. Whether Titanic involves that or not, it's never as sappy or average as other films that do that. The depiction of the relationship between memorable characters, Jack and Rose, is acceptable. But their story would never be as great if it weren't all taken and set on ship that leads to sinking.What's most memorable about the film, and what makes it such a classic epic, is the second half of the film. Titanic focuses on romance, but steers the ship to hit the iceberg and begin sinking. It's thankfully not just a 10 minute sequence, but devotes the entire sinking of the ship to the second half of the movie. The portrayal of the Titanic beginning to forward to the bottom of the ocean, snapping into two, and sticking right up before heading straight down is astonishingly-crafted. It's all gorgeous, intense, epic and depressing.Although the storytelling comes from Rose, the actual tale is equally viewed through the eyes of both Leonardo DiCaprio's young Jack and Kate Winslet's young Rose. Thankfully, it's not targeted at only one's issues. Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go on"" makes the perfect theme, the cast's performances make the perfect characters, and the whole movie should be left as the classic storyteller of Titanic.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Titanic
258,jonathanruano,Fall of the Titans,5,12 October 2009,"Just as the ship that couldn't be sunk sank in 1910, the movie ""Titanic"" which should not have failed went belly up and fell to the bottom of the sea. I seem to be going against the grain here and maybe I was the only one seeing this movie who didn't get it. I readily that there are great moments in this movie. The dramatic sequence where the Titantic ship becomes flooded with water and eventually sinks to the bottom is brilliant. What director James Cameron also does very well in exposing the sheer unfairness that some were allowed on the life boats, while others were not. In that connection, there was a emotive scene with a navy officer who, often against his own will, enforced this unfair system to the letter, not because it was the right thing to do, but because there were only so many life boats to go around and the prevailing view was that the few life boats available should go to the rich -- with the result that the rest were, in effect, left to die. What is also very good is that scene where some of the passengers are floating in the ice cold water, clinging on to whatever they could get their hands on, and quickly freezing to death.Yet, the film still does not quite work because of what preceded this sad, dramatic tragedy that was the sinking of the titanic. Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack and Kate Winslet's Rose were plausible characters, but they were very annoying to watch. Some of their lines were so out of place and absurd that I felt deeply embarrassed watching these people. The love story seemed rather contrived and unbelievable. Finally, James Horner's music in the background just made the whole thing worse. In short, I did not feel anything for these characters or identify with their love story; and that, more than anything else, was what dragged this movie down.",Titanic

Exactly when and where disaster will strike, no one knows for sure. But somewhere an iceberg is lurking in the dark with our name on it.The most cruel part of our fate is we have a James Cameron-class writer and director running the show.

It's much more than a film; it's an experience. You yourself feel you are on that ship; your emotions, your mood corresponds that of the characters. James Cameron's direction is a technical triumph. The man did not only manage to put to use a $202,000,000 budget, capture never before built sets, but on top of all that he had to show us characters, feelings, stories, lives and the ultimate fate of a doomed liner. Cameron passes the test that really takes every cinematic element to the maximum. Forget all that now. When you walk into a cinema and sit down for 3 hours which only seem like 90 minutes, you will know why Titanic is the film it is. A masterpiece in every respect.

The story this movie tells always tugs at my heart each time I see it. The emphasis of the terrible fate of the Titanic is heightened by the tragic love story that backs up the short time-line of the glorious ship as it heads towards its fate. The cast is fabulous, magnificent and really breathes life into their characters to make them realistic. Leonardo DiCaprio as the care- free, young and handsome Jack Dawson is the embodiment of who we all wish to be like in life whereas Kate Winslet's Rose DeWitt Bukater embodies where we lie in life if we don't attempt to break free and try and live a new life or experience a different world. The beauty of how real the film is adds to the majesty of the film's grandeur to the details of the ship the crew built and the characters that died or survived the disaster inhabit the structure.

After failing to find it and revealing so on television, Rose (Gloria Stuart), a survivor calls up Brock to go for visit.Rose quickly gets into the story of her experience on Titanic. We travel back in time to when Rose was young (Kate Winslet). Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is an aspiring artist who wins himself and his friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci), tickets on Titanic. Almost instantly, Jack falls for Rose - regardless of her being with Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).One night, Rose runs to the back of the boat. She leans off the rail ready to jump into the waters below - hopefully to her death. Jack sees her doing this and talks her out of it. Just as he is about to pull her in, she slips. He does bring her back over, but not before Cal has come to the rescue. Jack is seen as a hero and is invited to dinner the following night.Rose begins to have feelings for Jack and they also begin to see each other frequently. Rose poses nude for Jack, wearing only the Heart Of the Ocean. They are chased by Lovejoy (David Warner) but eventually get away and make love in a storage room, inside a vehicle.I am not one for movies that go over 180 minutes, but this one has always been an exception for the reasons of it not feeling like three hours and for it being a romance. Leonardo DiCaprio is not a favourite of mine. I hated him in almost anything else, so it's safe to say that I think this is his best performance.Kate Winslet was a no-name at this point and that was on purpose, but she was quickly noticed after this for such an amazing performance. It's no wonder why she was nominated for an Oscar. She is just so easy to fall in love with.James Cameron wrote and directed this masterpiece and does anyone wonder why it won 11 Oscars, and made $1.8 billion? It deserves all the praise it gets simply because it is an epic romance movie. The only epic romance I know. The score is just magnificent and it easily put James Horner on the map.It had a great supporting cast: Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Bernard Hill, Victor Garber, and Jonathan Hyde. The dialogue between Rose and Jack is sweet and warm-hearted. The action during the last hour is what really makes this so epic. The romance itself is fairy tale.The special effects are also stunning. I can't think of any flaws in this movie which is why I obviously give it a perfect score. Any romantic person will love this.

Yesterday, I just decided to randomly sit down and watch this movie, expecting nothing but a cheesy over the top romance movie. I was pleasantly surprised and blown away.As a person whose only ever seen Cameron's big three: T2, Aliens and Terminator, I never thought that any movie could ever near those three films. I have yet to see 'Avatar' which I will sometime but back to topic- Titanic blew me away as I had such low expectations.Everyone knows the story of 'Titanic', where a young boy and girl meet and fall in love. As time goes by, Titanic crashes into an iceberg causing the ship to slowly start to sink as the romance between the two gets stronger. Everyone also knows that this movie is somewhat considered one of the best and has won 11 Oscars, the most that is only tied with 'Return of the King' and 'Ben-hur'.There is so much that I love about 'Titanic' that I don't like in most romance movies. The chemistry between the two is amazing. The acting is great, the story is beautiful and emotionally gripping, the visuals are amazing, the epic scope is breath taking and the last hour is breath taking intensity after intensity. The characters are also amazing and the music is just beautiful. Cameron's writing and directing is great despite some cheesy lines such as 'I'm flying!' My main concern with Titanic before watching it was that I believed that Cameron wouldn't be up to the challenge as he is a director of action movies: T2, Aliens, Terminator, The Abyss, True Lies etc. He proved me wrong and I only love Cameron more for this! He has mastered creating epic dramas and epic romances with this movie To conclude this review here, 'Titanic' is an awesome, beautiful and emotionally gripping romance tale that is masterfully directed, brilliantly acted, with amazing visuals, a huge scope, amazing music and some great characters. The movie itself doesn't deserve to be called one of the very best nor in my opinion does it deserve the 11 Oscars it got but 'Titanic' is still....An amazing movie that everyone needs to check out!",Titanic

Since this movie came out, possibly a million has seen this movie, and now whenever you ask, ""Hey you remember Titanic?"" someone will respond with, ""Yes"". Unless they happen to have witnessed the Titanic sinking, they will respond with, ""You mean the ship or the movie? And by movie, which one?"" Because there have been so many movies made about the Titanic. But, I think this one, although none of the actors, directors, or screenwriters have witnessed the Titanic like some of the previous movies of the Titanic, they have told a great story using great special effects that may be the closest to what this generation has to witnessing the Titanic.I was born in 1993, so you can tell how young I was when I saw this movie. Most of my life, I assumed that Gloria Stuart was actually an old woman who has been on the Titanic, until I began doing more on the internet than chatting, which must have been around 2005. I was an idiot, and I found out there was no old lady on the Titanic who told her story to director James Cameron and therefor, this movie is almost completely fake. Maybe there was a Jack and Rose and an old painting that has been lost at sea. But the chances that is true is no different than the chances of me getting a girlfriend this year. Which is low. Haha. Wah.Jack and Rose, two lovers from completely different worlds, come on a ship that happens to be the biggest ship the world has ever seen at that time. Which is quite strange because just recently, I have learned that since that time, we have built bigger ships and hardly any of them ever got destroyed by an iceberg or our messages for ""HELP!"" were seemed as a joke. They don't love each other at first, but they soon learn that they will love each other and one of them is willing to die just so the other can survive and leave the Titanic. It's a heartfilling story of the Titanic. While Leonardo DiCaprio may suck at his other movies, haha.. lol. He's excellent in this movie which may have built his career. Also, I don't think anyone could have made Rose better than Kate Winslet.I recommend this movie for the whole family. Just cover your eyes once you get to the nudity.. well, cover your children's eyes. The only nudity there is is when Jack draws Rose naked, which is a very romantic scene and which makes the picture that is found under the sea which brings the fake old lady Rose played by Gloria Stuart who has never been on the Titanic to find the picture and come to the people looking to discover gold or whatever the hell they were discovering. Cover your eyes if you're offended, too.. which I doubt it because that would be humiliating and embarrassing. There is also a sex scene which you don't get to see the nudity, so don't worry.

They really got the details down perfectly and it seemed as if each room shown in the film was flawless.Some of the scenes in this film are just awesome. Especially the scene where the Titanic hits the Iceberg. THe whole sinking scene in particular is dramatic and will keep you captivated.Acting is good for the most part. DiCaprio is pretty good in this film and this may be one of his better performances but I really have not seen that many of his films. Same with Kate Winslett. Actually acting may be the biggest weakness of the film but that is just because everything else is outstanding. I thought the captain of the Titanic was well performed as were the entire crew of the Titanic.Music is spectacular. Not much more to add.This is a really good film.

267,HenryHextonEsq,A grotesque embarrassment of ill-ordered riches.,3,11 June 2003,"An appalling, galling 'spectacle' and slapdash mix of effects, melodrama and romance. ""Titanic"" is utterly misguided; shamefully populist and hoist by its own focus group petard. This is not showmanship of the grandiose and warm kind of a Selznick; it is the cold, mechanical assemblage feat of a bragging Cameron. It is far from unique; and much in the usual Hollywood action vein, with undramatic noisiness, prosaic lighting, and faceless acting.Even 'Our Kate' can't save it... the busty Miss Winslet puts a bit more presence into things initially, but she can't truly work within the confines of such a dire nonentity of a script; her Rose just becomes irritating and strained in effect as the film wears painfully on. Di Caprio is awful; a rubbery, glib little presence who increases the quotient of dull artifice - that this film is already unduly well stocked with. Indeed, this film may as well not have included any actors, as Cameron seems so entirely disinterested in them; for all the pretence of this being a 'human story', there is precious little humanity in this film. An out-of-place love story 'suffices'; actors like Bernard Hill are left adrift, with little to convey - even in a film stretching past three hours. A problem is that the effects are flashy and thoroughly incongruous to any image of the historical event. Crucially there is no dignity to this film; where it should have used Gavin Bryars' poignant, cavernous, driftwood-epic soundscape, ""The Sinking of the Titanic"" for its score, instead we have James Horner's parodic, cliched John Williams-esque bluster and blandness, telegraphing every 'emotion' and example of pyrotechnics. It's an awful score, instilling a very familiar, action movie-moronic ethos; this sense of the events being sold short comes across equally in Di Caprio's pipsqueak playing and Winslet's rather ungainly starry turn.How much better would the historical events have been served by Bryars' music, dignified, still and unusual camera placements, and a depersonalized sad grandeur? A semi-documentary, in grainy, mournful black and white would far better suit this subject; think ""Wisconsin Death Trip"" and you'll be understand in part how I envisage it. I want to shut this awful James Cameron white elephant out of my mind, and let a more graceful film play there.Rating:- */*****",Titanic

This movie proves that enough of those were born to carry this waste of celluloid to $1.6 billion dollars in gross earnings.""Waste of celluloid""? No, wait. That's a gross exaggeration. Actually, you could snip out all the scenes with Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet, shorten the sinking scenes by 1/2, add some historical characters, and end up with a glorious 1 1/2 - 2 hour movie. Because, as it is, this movie is a gross slap on the face of all those who lost their lives on that ship, who seemingly died so that Kate Winslet could ""live her life to the fullest extent"".The movie, well, it's unwatchable. Completely, totally unwatchable as it is. That is, if you are not a 15 year old girl with a crush on diCaprio. For the rest of us, the movie drags incredibly slowly. Honestly, I only wanted for the thing to start sinking after the first hour.OTOH, the sinking scenes are terrific. Way above average. Very, very good. But what's the use of those scenes when you have to endure the pain of 1 1/2 hours of romantic nonsense? Especially when there is absolutely NO chemistry between the main characters.I have another idea. Steal some scenes from ""A Night to Remember"", cut the sinking scenes from ""Titanic"", and make a new movie. That would be good.... but no hordes of screaming girls would attend the movie, so no box office records could be made, so no Hollywood director would attempt to do it.

269,stevenfallonnyc,"Yes, I think this is a GREAT film",10,21 December 2003,"""Titanic""....this movie on the surface would normally strike fear into the hearts of film fans like myself, who usually despise most typical mainstream drivel. While I am a huge film fan, I rarely go to the movies in theaters anymore because everything just looks so BAD. The last film I have seen in theaters was actually ""Spider-Man,"" a great film marred by the horrible cartoonish special effects.My tastes in film vary greatly...I love the classics (Cagney, Bogie, etc), romance, B-flicks, Godzilla films, car chases, superhero stuff and much more. However, almost all the films I like were made before the 90's, when film started to get REALLY bad. I also love to observe a good phenomenon - whoch ""Titanic"" became almost instantly.I read all about ""Titanic"" before it was released, how the budget went up to a staggering $200 million making the film a tremendous gamble. When it was released in late '97, it did very good but not great numbers - but the word of mouth on this film was unlike anything seen since Star Wars probably - the box office take remained steady for a LONG time. As weeks went by, it actually earned more and more, and the phenomenon had started.Then in late 1998, when the film was still playing some theaters almost a year later, and for a whole year we've heard how unbelievable ""Titanic"" was and how Leo was adored by girls all over the world and how hot Kate was - I finally kicked in 2 bucks at a discount theater to see what all the fuss was finally about. Alone (in a packed theater) as not to be distracted by a friend, I got my snick snacks, found my seat, and watched with a completely open mind.Three hours later, I, who again hates virtually everything mainstream these days, said to myself, that was one of the greatest films I had ever seen.Many say ""Titanic"" is ""fomulatic,"" ""typical Hollywood drivel,"" and the famous, ""...but we know the ending, the ship sinks."" I say, ""Titanic"" was an extremely rare present-day excursion in old-school grandiose film-making. Huge sets were built as opposed to having everything drawn with computer effects. It was a great romantic story, which the audience was compelled to feel for, especially having the knowledge ahead of time that it would be doomed (""the ship sinks""). It had great drama, great music (even the one song I can stand hearing Celine Dion sing), and a lot of heart from James Cameron who, love him or hate him, showed amazing dedication to getting his epic on screen.And say whatever you want about Leonardo DiCaprio - he was excellent in Titanic and is one of the very best actors out there right now.Anyone who has read some of my other reviews would know that I hate computer effects. But the CGI in ""Titanic"" is the one instance where they actually do work a little, because they do not overtake the picture and aren't the focus. It definitely is not the same as watching a cartoon Spider-Man battle a cartoon Green Goblin in a film that is not supposed to be a cartoon.""Titanic,"" dare I say, is the ""Gone With The Wind"" of our time. it's a huge movie, a blood, sweat and tears movie, a movie with some real elbow grease behind it. And never boring for a second.""Titanic"" is arguably the best film of the 90's (only ""Goodfellas"" gives it a run for that title in my opinion), and is probably one of the greatest 40 films ever made. Now that may be a surprising thing for me to say given I am such a huge fan of the classics, but however rare it may be, there are extremely rare instances when something new is in the same league as something classic.One last note - it is surprising that this film has such a bare-bones DVD out. While there are rumors that a ""special edition"" DVD is in the works, the present DVD is a disappointment with no extras at all. Considering this movie at three hours long had two hours CUT from it alone would make some good extras in deleted scenes. Add on the commentaries, a few ""makings of"" and add on a bunch of other crap and you have got a killer, proper DVD release for ""Titanic.""",Titanic

The film has some of the best acting from Winslet and DiCaprio and some of the best character chemistry between them. The direction lead by James Cameron is phenomenal. The ending to the film is one of the most intense, beautiful and sad endings I've ever seen, i can not remark one flaw about it. The cinematography is great and the film has some of the best and most memorable shots in cinema history (yes, that including the scene where Jack holds Rose up at the ship deck). The soundtrack is amazing, including Celine Dion's fantastic song that totally fits the feel of the film. Titanic is a must watch, one i would have killed for to see on the big screen!

273,canuckteach,Cameron Delivers..!,9,2 March 2008,"For weeks after seeing the film, whenever I heard on the radio the flute introduction to ""My Heart Will Go On"" (Celine Dion), I became teary-eyed! So, I guess I am a sentimentalist! I think James Cameron delivered a unique, technically-brilliant period piece that could touch the heart, and inform audiences about some significant features of a long-forgotten era.For one, this time period was marked by severe class distinction. I believe that, in 1900, 1% of the USA population controlled 99% of the wealth. Britain, of course, had always been a society where the privileged were noted by everything from their manner of dress, hat style, speech patterns, and clubs where they drank. The film shows the severe gap between the wealthy first-class passengers, and those in 'steerage' where Jack was lodged. Some have argued that poor Jack would never have gotten near Rose a second time. But remember: Rose is a rebel. There's the basis for the relationship. And what better way to illustrate the snobbery of class distinction than by having Jack sit down to dinner with the crusty industrialists? Also, many on the Titanic were on their way to the 'new world' for great opportunities. They had a great struggle (note the passengers who could neither read nor write English?), but they came anyway to escape the oppression of cruel power struggles in Europe.The sheer folly - and tragedy - of piling through iceberg-infested waters in a large, awkward vessel is explained and demonstrated very clearly (in case anyone is still trying to figure it out!).This film is on my IMDb Top-20 .. http://www.imdb.com/mymovies/list?l=8401903 (yikes-I realized I better get busy and finally write a review!), but I will admit that some shortfalls in screenplay prevent it from usurping 'Citizen Kane', 'Amadeus' or Sir David Lean's entries as a true cinematic masterpiece. Note that I said screenplay - not acting, for actors can only deliver the lines on the page. I have always loved PART-1 much more than PART-2. I think that has to do with the 'mix' and 'editing', particularly involving the final scene with Jack and Rose. A few snips here and there would have reduced the melodramatic element. Overall, a little less of the love story, and more development of some other characters would have elevated the presentation. My take is that the screenplay 'missed' - but not by much. The result was a brilliant piece of cinematography that could not field any major players as viable candidates for Oscars in acting.Having said that, there is so much to recommend this fine film. I was very moved by the way Cameron had his Titanic cast assemble for a sort of curtain-call within the movie - haven't seen that before, very unique and effective.9/10 - canuckteach (--:",Titanic

Nobody could have captured with such emotion and scope the depiction of what happened in the Atlantic 95 years ago except James Cameron. Terminator 3 and this had the same budget - Terminator 3 was good, but this film blew me away. It truly raises the bar for film-making and success in the film industry. It has been a couple of years since I last saw this film, and my memory starts to fail me. But you just can't forget some of the special effects on this film and how they changed the world of films. Monumental images that stick in your mind forever are created with grand scale to breathtaking effect, and the film stays emotional throughout its three hours - so you always care. This film was made to win Oscars, and win Oscars it did.

If you think that this movie is silly because of the dialogue, it's obvious you're all forgetting that this movie was made to entertain! It's the same thing with star wars: it's sort of a fable, and the dialogue is much cheesier than that of this film.

We are no longer together, but I still remember him saying that the way the two were holding each others hands at the bow of the boat, reminded him of the way we touched each other's hands at the time. We were in love, just as Rose and Jack were. This movie also touched home because I too came from money and thought most of the rich people I knew and had dated were uptight and didn't seem to let loose enough and have fun....and I was afraid too I would fall in a trap to it and live a boring existence. It gave me more strength to branch out and not search for someone to love just because of their wealth and status in the world, but instead find love for whats inside a person. My world is better now because of that decision. So I thank you Titanic!",Titanic
279,Ziya90,"As a romance, it is simple, as a disaster movie, it is underwhelming",5,18 March 2010,"Let's start with James Cameron. He made the greatest action movie ever made and also one of the greatest science fiction movies of all time, The Terminator 2 Judgment Day. The Terminator was excellent too, but 2 surpassed even that. By only these two movies, he has become one of the greatest directors of all time, don't you agree? However, it was really weird that he wanted to make such a movie. Thus, Titanic does not look like a James Cameron movie at all and additionally it is lack of creativity, James Cameron creativity. You know, by considering The Terminator movies, you can see how a creative director James Cameron is. Titanic is an ordinary movie, a simple movie on all counts. Everything is simple that I will mention later. At that time, Leonardo Di Caprio was at the top, the beloved of teenage girls, in fact, young or not, females were admirers of him. I like Di Caprio and he is still liked, may be even more because of the performances he gave in his recent movies, but what I am trying to say is that I try to find out the reasons, why a lot of people love the movie and it broke a record at the box office, became the most watched film of all time? It was owing to Di Caprio? Well, I don't think so, I mean not only owing to him which is sad. Because as said the movie is simple on all counts. As for Kate Winslett, as an actress, she is one of my favorite actresses ever, I just love her, but players cannot save a movie, this is what I believe. The love story is simple. Let me summarize it one more time. A poor boy. A rich girl. And the rich (and black hearted) fiancée of that girl. The family of the girl want their daughter marry him, but she is not sure. Then, the poor boy and the girl meet and fall in love with each other. See? You know, James Cameron is rather an action (and science fiction) director, isn't he? and this is a disaster movie besides romance, isn't it? but this side of the matter, action, excitement are simple either. You expect the same masterful, perfectionist and creative level for Titanic, but it is not. I did not get satisfy on this count, because Cameron does not focus on disaster, he focuses on romance and this is weird. This is a three hours movie, but the disaster side of it is unsatisfying. Therefore, the people who had expected an exciting, suspenseful disaster movie disappoint like me. As for the Oscar issue, yes it broke a record in the Oscar history too, 11 Oscars! To me, there are two wrong decisions in the Oscar history. One is Titanic's 11 Oscar winning, the other is Shakespeare in Love won the best picture Oscar instead of Saving Private Ryan. I should confess that the other was much more painful, because if you ask me, to give the best picture Oscar to Shakespeare in Love while one of the other nominees is Saving Private Ryan is something like to give the best picture Oscar to The Notebook while one of the other nominees is 12 Angry Men. Returning to Titanic, the love story in it is not heavy or dull at all like Shakespeare in Love by the way which is good news and despite I am not female, it was real touching and at the end, my ears filled with tears. However, unfortunately these do not make the movie great. Let's talk about the branches which Titanic won Oscar. By the way, as for entertainment, yes I was entertained, but not very much. The best editing. Well, this is not Memento or Amores Perros, the editing was 'normal' in this one. The best cinematography. If it is one of the bests, then what is Amelie then for example or Across the Universe? The best costume design. What were the costumes, daily life costumes? Yes. Titanic was not a period movie exactly wasn't it? Even if it was, the costumes were ordinary, daily life costumes. The best art direction. Again, Titanic is 'normal' on this count. Amelie, 2001, Batman, these are the examples come to my mind now. If we talk about the themes of the movie, it is seen that they are simple either as everything else. Follow your heart, money does not bring happiness, believe immortal love etc.",Titanic

The ship gliding through the water does not look real.

281,jacksflicks,"The Second Worst ""Best Picture"" in History",6,14 October 1999,"There is, in the Motion Picture Academy, a hidden criterion for awards. It's called the Miracle Factor.  If a huge, overblown spectacle film production manages to make a killing at the box office and isn't as bad a everyone thought it would be, it acknowledges this miracle with its Best Picture award.  This has happened at least twice:  in 1952, the malign, Red-baiting Cecil B. De Mille, bullied the corrupt, Red-baiting Academy into presenting him with an Oscar for the ridiculous circus spectacle, Greatest Show on Earth; then, in 1997, an equally corrupt, politically correct Academy presented Titanic with its Oscar.Titanic deserved an Oscar in only one category - special effects.  The story was trite, the acting mediocre (except Leo's, which didn't even get nominated), the editing OK (maybe deserving of an Oscar, since great special effects demand great editing).  Titanic's ""beating"" out L.A. Confidential is akin to Greatest Show on Earth's ""beating"" out High Noon.  Standing alone, Titanic is just another disaster spectacle.  But placed beside a film like L.A. Confidential, Titanic becomes pure garbage.This view is no better vindicated than by the Academy's choice for Best Picture the following year, Shakespeare in Love.  If Titanic got the ""Miracle it Wasn't That Bad"" Oscar, then Shakespeare in Love was given the ""Bad Conscience for Titanic"" Oscar. By the way, if you want to see a GOOD dramatization of the Titanic disaster, get A Night to Remember instead of this travesty.",Titanic

283,bbhlthph,Lots of Hype but little substance,4,14 August 2003,"In general I am not keen on large budget spectacular productions such as ""Titanic"". Whilst the large budget goes in creating expensive but not always useful (and even sometimes counterproductive) special effects, it also creates a situation where enormous public interest becomes necessary if the investors are to recover their money; so that  the film concerned has to be continually promoted with a great deal of hype. Seldom does the excessive expenditure lead to a better script, better acting, better direction or better photography, and these are what govern the quality of the final product. Titanic won an incredible number of Oscars, which are supposed to be completely independent awards (11 in all I believe). At the time I cynically took the view that the need for these Oscars as a bait for attracting large audiences had led to extensive funding of media promotions designed to ensure that this particular film was in the mind of all the judges when the selections were actually being made. I also remember feeling very upset that several superb performances in lesser low budget films made during the same year appeared to be being squeezed out by all this hoop-la. Nevertheless once all these awards had been made, I had sufficient faith in the Academy Award system to assume that there must indeed be something totally exceptional about this movie, and I made a mental note that I should see it at some future time. It was a long time after this, when I did so, and found to my amazement the film was only a somewhat indifferent fictional drama in the tearjerker category, with its appeal stiffened by some very spectacular special effects. It was also far far too lengthy to sustain the viewer's interest in its rather simple dramatic story. My faith in the Academy Award system was bruised but not totally broken as I told myself that I must be missing something if I could not fully endorse the apparent judgement of the vast mass of the public and almost all the critics. This feeling continued until only a few days ago when I chanced to browse through the user comments on this film in your data base and at last realized that my views were quite widely supported and I need not be ashamed of them. (The fact that I initially felt ashamed of my rather critical views is probably a good indication of the degree of hype which developed around this film.)
I am not attempting to deny that Titanic is certainly a better than average film and I do not want my comments to appear totally destructive. The recreation of the ship, and of its death throes, is superbly done but if one is viewing the most expensive movie ever filmed one is entitled to expect very dramatic special effects - the real question is what do they really contribute to the story, and in this case the answer is very little. Overall, the film is extremely well made, but its script is very poor, the characterisation is stereotyped and much of the acting is no more than acceptable, I can see nothing other than some effective but unimportant special effects to justify the status it has been accorded. It fails right from the start as it does not appear to know whether it is intended as a documentary record of a dreadful tragedy or a bittersweet but highly improbable romance. The disparate pull of these two themes continues throughout the film, but ultimately leaves the documentary recreation of the liner and its one tragic voyage as certainly its best feature.Why did the scriptwriter and director (James Cameron) feel that it was necessary to incorporate a fictional romance into this film? Over fifteen hundred real people actually died, wives and children were torn from fathers they hardly knew. There was real drama in why the Carpathia did not steam to the rescue of the survivors more promptly and this has remained of ongoing interest ever since. The design of the ship, the materials used in its construction, the route followed by the voyage, and the part played by the so-called blue riband for the fastest Atlantic crossing have all been featured in dramas relating to this voyage and some of them were also mentioned in passing in this film. Surely there was enough dramatic interest in the actual story to avoid any need for the fictional additions. In practice this decision has detracted so much from the tale which was crying out to be told that for me at least the film was spoiled.The rating you give it will depend primarily upon whether you regard the fictional romance or the factual documentary of the Titanic's only voyage as of greater importance. My rating for the romance between Rose and Jack would be no higher than 3/10 because most of the characters concerned are no more than caricatures. The documentary leaves out so much that a similar rating could seem quite generous, but the special effects recreation of the actual sinking makes me feel that a rating of 5/10 would actually be reasonable. Averaging these, and ignoring the problems associated with not knowing whether the film is a romance or a documentary, yields a final rating for the film as released of 4/10, which is probably reasonable.",Titanic

285,xan-the-crawford-fan,I like love stories on boats,1,3 August 2021,"The love stories that take place on cruise ships/ocean liners are things like Letty Lynton (1932), Love Affair (1939 one) and Now, Voyager (1942). All three of those are fairly melodramatic, have a touch of tragedy, but they all end up well in the end. And they're well done- good cinematography, good acting, the leads have chemistry, and I want Joan Crawford's Letty Lynton dress in my wardrobe. What does this film have to offer?A cure for insomnia and major disappointment. Not that I was expecting anything going in.I think I set a record for complaining- I moaned all the way through this film when my mother forced me to watch it. She loves it, but I think she just loves it because of the sheep mentality that newer films force on us. This film (if one can call it a film) has a twenty minute plot padded out into three hours and fourteen minutes. Neither Winslet nor DiCaprio can act to save their lives, they don't have any chemistry...and...guess what...Kate Winslet bares her breasts again! Did she ever do anything else? These people are Oscar-winning actors? Don't make me laugh. The rest of the supporting cast may as well be made of cardboard. Kathy Bates was just annoying. All the characters were clichés to begin with, not even actors that could act could have pulled this film off.The director is not a good director. He uses generic, already used shots from other films. Kate Winslet's ""contemplating suicide"" scene is borrowed from Mildred Pierce (which, funnily, Kate would go on to star in a craptastic remake of.) I was actually cheering when the boat started sinking.But then it got boring, because that five minute plot device was the second half of the film.I also cheered when Leonardo DiCaprio died, because I don't like him, he's not attractive (he doesn't even have charisma) and he's got a stupid haircut that no-one had in 1912, or even 1952. Another cheer came out of me when the credits rolled, although that cheer became a gag when I realized that they were going to play that godawful theme song. The Celine Dion croaks. You know, ""My Heart Will Go On.""How this film was nominated for fourteen Oscars is beyond me. Although, I hope people note that none of them were for acting. All About Eve, which held the record for most Oscar nods before this film slogged its way into the Oscars, is not a great film, and not worthy of 14 Oscar nods, but it's still eons better than this trash masquerading as a ""modern day classic"".This is one of those films that more people talk about than have actually seen.

Yes he's given better acting performances in other movies (What's Eating Gilbert Grape), but in Titantic he was still very good. Of course I don't think people dislike DiCaprio because of his acting. They just don't like him for some reason. Yet I never heard anything bad about him before Titanic made him a mega superstar.In my opinion, Titanic is a great film. It was one of the best in 1997 and was still popular in the summer of 1998 when it was still being shown in the theaters. That alone is a fantastic achievement. So all you hypocrites can laugh all you want. The fact is that this movie is still well liked by many, and is still the biggest selling movie of all time in 2006. Update, very late I know.

289,kyle-cruse,"Mostly historically accurate, but badly focused",8,10 September 2008,"When this film first came out, I was a Titanic buff and read as many books and saw as many documentaries on the actual ship as I could get my hands on. As I result, I realized the great lengths James Cameron went to in order to make ""Titanic"" as historically accurate as possible, in terms of the events of the ship itself. The film is perfectly done in that way, as it is the most realistic film about the Titanic ever made, in my opinion. Nevertheless, it is not nearly a perfect film, and I'll tell you why. All the young girls in the world will kill me for this, but I feel that the film is far too focused on the fictional romance between Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). This is not the first time a fictional story has found its way into a Titanic film (take the 1953 version with Clifton Webb for example). Being such a buff on the real Titanic, I did not like how so much of the film was focused on this story. What I really wanted was true historical facts about the tragedy shown on film. The story does not really need to be spiced up. It is tragic and fascinating, with tons of little interesting details, all on its own. It is truly a great story simply written by God himself. If you enjoy the romance between Jack and Rose, you're not alone. That seems to be why most people love this film. Nevertheless, I found all of the facts about the Titanic in this film to be completely accurate and well-portrayed. It is a worthwhile film for just about anyone. Not worthy of all 11 Oscars, though. ""Good Will Hunting"" is what should have won that year. Of course, this does have that great original song ""My Heart Goes On,"" definitely worthy of its Oscar.*** out of ****",Titanic
290,BadWebDiver,Actually good storytelling,9,12 September 2003,"Despite the fashionable negative reviews that a lot of film snobs seem to pass on this movies, it actually is a very good telling of a famous story. I admit when I went to see this movie, I thought I'd be cheering for the iceberg. But the dramatization does work very well, with characters who have engaging personalities, and the right mix of drama and humor.SPOILER WARNINGI am a bit disappointed that my fav line from this movie - ""Why do the British have to announce dinner like it's a cavalry charge?"" - turned out to be ""borrowed"" from the 1956 Clifton Webb version. Actually I think the really far-fetched bit of storytelling is how Rose survives after diving in and out of the allegedly-freezing cold water about five or six times. She gets wet more often that Jack does! I can only figure she must be full to the brim on alcohol (which may explain a lot - ha, ha!)Still, the story is delivered very effectively and keeps you involved all the way through. The contrasts between the early part of the 20th century, and the modern salvage expedition scenes is very thematically effective. It certainly gives a new and interesting perspective, and helps the modern viewer relate to the events. Great storytelling device. I also recommend that people should check out the telemovie made the year before with Barry Pepper and Catherine Zeta Jones. That one works quite well too, especially for a lower budget.",Titanic
291,David_Frames,The movie that made my face list to the right,6,9 May 2003,"Surely millions of people worldwide, a billion dollars and 11 Oscars can't be wrong can they? Well yes, actually.The problem with Titanic is that Cameron treats the whole enterprise like one of his action pictures, replete with the kind of staging you'd expect from that genre, but not alas, from a dramatisation of a genuine tragedy. Cameron has no faith in the emotional weight of the historical facts, and if we were being cynical we could also say no interest. This is an exercise in ego and directorial hubris from the outset, namely the idea that the writers fictional teenage romance - a story that never succeeds in rising above its clichéd origins, is required to connect a contemporary audience to the events of 1912. You can see the logic because clearly the world's worst peacetime maritime tragedy, 1,500 dead and the planets most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage isn't an interesting enough story in itself. Subsequently the titular ship becomes merely a backdrop for a populist voyage into tedium. Just as you'd feel uneasy at the prospect of Michael Bay doing Jane Austen, Cameron doing period romance seems a little far fetched. Jack and Rose allow us to spend some time on the ship prior to its sinking and an impressive recreation it is but you'd quite like them to go away so we could see what the real passengers were up to. That he sustains momentum throughout this picture is despite his script, rather than because of it. His talent for pacing and moving a story forward serves him well in this respect but with fictional characters as one note as these, and with the ships real passengers reduced to supporting parts to bolster Cameron's mills and boon narrative, we, unlike the real passengers are quite grateful to see the Iceberg emerging from the watery depths.Once the ship hits the film moves up a gear and suddenly there is enough to sustain interest until the stilted syrup drenched epilogue. However, Cameron still stages the sinking like one giant set piece which saps the film of any emotional impact. A real tribute to the ship, rather than a cynical exercise in emotional manipulation would have taken an objective position and allowed the real events to unfold, giving us a chance to take in the full force of real events. This film concerns itself with fiction and doing so attempts to tell you what to feel and when to feel it. For me, this has the opposite effect and the scenes toward the end featuring Winslet and Decaprio are virtually unwatchable.The production design is superb and its all very epic and grandiose but ultimately Titanic is a disappointment because it takes a real tragedy and turns it into populist entertainment. History for people not interested in History. If you think thats a harsh assessment then imagine a similar scenario applied to a retelling of the September 11th attacks and think how inappropriate that would seem. These people may be 90 odd years dead but they deserve more respectful treatment than this. Watch ""A night to remember"" (1958) for a far better depiction of events which was informed by accounts of the sinking not by one man who thought he had something to 'add' to this terrible event. Avoid.",Titanic
292,SPZMaxinema,(Mostly) Worthy of its acclaim!,8,25 October 2021,"While a bit excessive and grandiose at times with some uneven sequencing (and I can see how some might think that about it), it is undeniably a very well-directed and executed film with fine acting and writing overall. I bought into the romance, the series of events, and details behind the portrayal of the sinking of the ship! It definitely wasn't bad, nothing is really bad with Leonardo DiCaprio in it too!",Titanic

294,ThomasColquith,A Big movie in every sense,6,3 October 2021,"""Titanic"" is obviously a big budget well-produced film even if the CGI is somewhat dated though good for its time. The leads, Kate and Leonardo, have great performances, delivering a powerful romantic yarn, however these positives of ""Titanic"" are offset by an over-indulgence of its own spectacle and grandiosity. This lack of self-restraint and efficient editing and storytelling really affect the second half of the film, making it a chore to get thru. Basically from the time the ship hits the iceberg the film suffers, it should have wrapped up with the catastrophe taking 20 minutes or so with a further 10 minute epilogue. But as it stands now at 3 and 1/4 hours it is 45 minutes too long or so. In summary, a famous film that probably appeals more to women, or young girls, than men, but it still holds up and is not bad even though it is a bit long and tedious. My rating: 6/10.",Titanic
295,lotus_chief,VERY OVERRATED!!!!,4,5 August 2003,"SPOILERS INCLUDED...Although I made a vow to myself to NEVER see this movie, my girlfriend begged me to rent it and sit through it with her.  So, very reluctantly, I did.  And let me just say, Titanic was everything I expected.  Titanic is nothing but an overly sappy, unrealistic, historically incorrect, drawn out, trashy film.  With all the hype this film received, after seeing it I expected to see Titanic on IMDB's Top 250 list...but it's not!  WHEW!! Good, because it doesn't deserve to be.  My God, WHAT WAS THE HYPE ABOUT?? Why was this movie 3 hours and 14 minutes?  That alone is a BIG flaw of this film because we all know what's going to happen in the end.... why let the audience wait 2.5 hours to see the inevitable?  This movie could've been cropped to 2.5 easily...which still maybe would've been too long.  The corny love story was just horrible.  The language used, especially by DiCaprio's character, was totally unbelievable and unconvincing....we're supposed to be in 1912, remember??  Kate Winslet came off as an annoying little brat....DiCaprio was barely tolerable.  Another thing that turned me off to the film was the story.  How could people embrace this film so much in its account of the Titanic experience... and the story is fictional?  We're supposed to take Cameron's word for it? Please!  The love story, along with the overall script he wrote was SICKENING.  The only good part of the film is when the boat starts to sink....that's the only part of the film that really matters.   
Now my major gripe with the film:  What was the deal with Rose taking up the whole door???  LOL.  Did you all see how big that door was???  You mean to tell me that Jack couldn't fit on the door with her?  She claimed she loved Jack...even went back to save him while he was chained to the pipe in that room that was flooding.  If that was the case why couldn't she make room for him to get up on the door with her instead of freezing to death in the Atlantic?? I'm curious whether anyone else has wondered that....The scene i mentioned above embodies my feelings about Titanic.  It seems Cameron just wanted to get some Oscars, so he put the formula together to do so.  Get Celine Dion to sing da song, the sappy score, put Leo in there so all da little girls would go see it and feel sorry for him, have a HUGE budget, use lots of CGI and make it a 3+ hour film (so it could be an epic of course).  it all comes across as CHEAP!  He was trying too hard to appeal to everyone...it has the sappy emotional, 'boo-hoo' aspect for the ladies and the graphic action-packed death sequences for the guys.  In the end we have 3 hours of confusion and essentially pointless narrative.  I finally sat through this film and, like I knew it would, it justified my initial thoughts of it when it first released in '97.  Corny, horrible story, and completely overdone.  Bottom line, this movie sucked, and has to be the most overrated film I've seen in a LONG, long time, maybe ever.  *1/2 out of ****.",Titanic
296,thatgirlmyra-9946,Tragically Romantic,8,23 September 2019,"While not my favourite movie in the world, this is still a very solid movie. I'm not sure I understand the popularity and almost cultish following this has. But regardless, the costumes, acting, and storyline are all undeniably good and I have a feeling most people will at least enjoy this film.",Titanic
297,MF210,Succeeds as Eye Candy but not much else,4,8 November 2003,"My Rating:* out of ****.Titanic is such a sensational looking film that it could be called the most expensive piece of eye candy. Like all films by James Cameron, Titanic is visually stunning from the sets to the special effects. Yet while Cameron's films are great to look at they usually have more going for them than this one. Titanic was unworthy of many of its oscars and is one of the most overrated films of all time.The first problem with this film is its script. James Cameron is not a professional at writing love stories and this clearly illustrates that point. The dialogue is corny and stupid. It makes me wonder why he didnt have Aliens invade Titanic. Yes the idea sounds horrible but I will take ""Get Away From Her You Bitch"" over ""Your gonna live on and your gonna have lots of babies"" I mean how corny and dumb is that.Strong Acting is a requirement for a film to succeed over a flat scrip. However, this is where Titanic fails again. I had no clue what Dicaprio was trying to do with this character. I am glad Spielberg taught him how to act in Catch Me If You Can. Kate Winslett is also horrible but her character is treated badly by the script. However, Billy Zane is actually quite good. Kathy Bates also holds her own, though her screentime is limited. Gloria Stewart is horribly irritating as the older Kate Winslett character.James Cameron is a filmmaker who has great skills. Yet those skills are not on display here. His direction comes across as inept and uninspired. His skills here are better than his skills as a screenwriter for the film but thats not saying much.Like I said, Titanic succeeds as eye candy but not much else. The Sets are glorious looking. The cinematography is beautiful. The Costumes are breathtaking to behold. The Sound is top notch. The Visual Effects rank as some of the most impressive to come out of the 90s. Titanic is nice looking in pretty much everyway. If only everything else came into play Titanic would have been a good film. The visuals of the film were something not wasted in the making of this film.Titanic suffers from two other flaws: Unconvincing Chemistry and an OVERLONG running time. The chemistry between Leo and Kate was hailed as some of the best of the 90's but I found it flatter than a pancake. Titanic is waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyy tooo long. It has a very uninteresting and sluggish two hours. The only excitement I got was seeing Kate Winslett's boobs, which are more impressive than the film. During its final hour, the pace does pick up. The Sinking is a glorious sight yet Leo and Kate's characters are still there. The last shot of the film is stupid, that has deleted scene written all over it.James Cameron has a solid resume of films. He created Terminator I and II, Aliens, and True Lies. All these films showed the work of a skilled director, even though The Terminator gets the lowest rating it was a good film and showed a director with skill. Titanic shows a cocky asshole who should give his oscar to Curtis Hanson(director of the superior LA Confidential). This is easily the worst I have seen from Cameron.",Titanic
298,michael_the_nermal,Overrated Melodrama; Not Worth 1/16th of What it Made,5,21 June 2006,"I guess people love romance and melodrama. I found that this movie would only appeal to pre-pubescent girls with a storybook notion of romance and lovey-dovey mush. This movie is one of the most highly overrated in movie history, if only because it is the most successful film ever made, and the critics seem to sing with the choir of the global audience that paid over $1 billion to watch it. The love story is, as I said, pure mush, with a cardboard (yet effeminate) villain, played by Billy Zane. The story itself is a flimsy framework to show off the grand effect of the giant ship snapping to pieces and drowning doomed computer-animated passengers. The Celine Dion song for this is atrocious (it polluted the airwaves for much of 1997), and is just as sickening as this film. The characters are bland and uncompelling, the story slow and plodding, and the special effects are the only reason to enjoy this movie.This movie belongs with the likes of any of those mushy 1980s romance or romantic comedy sort of films. For those who like melodrama, you may like ""Titanic."" Most guys will want to pass on this film, unless your girlfriends force you to watch against your own will. I personally found the story of the Mexican props crew who built the pseudo-Titanic to be far, FAR, FAR more compelling than the sappy love story between Jack and Rose.",Titanic

Really, pop-crap is what this is, nothing more. People proclaim James Cameron as some good director - this is the guy that directed ""Piranha Part Two: The Spawning"" for crying out loud!

Just on the chance that the last person to see it is reading this, then here goes.There are very few things to quibble about in this movie. The sets are phenomenal. The ship is magnificent. How they could create such a marvel is beyond me. The story is the key, however. It really is a relatively simple boy meets girl, falls in love, saves her life, gives his sort of a tale. A Romeo and Juliet on water.The performers are engaging, but I wouldn't go so far as to say the acting was spectacular. DiCaprio was very good, but otherwise the acting was adequate. The story was extremely good and fit in well to the historical event.I only wouldn't give this movie a 10 because it was a little depressing in the end and it was also a period piece - not my favorite genre.

301,blacklist-1,Beautiful and haunting. Truly epic on every scale.,10,11 April 2010,"I must say I'm surprised at the low IMDb rating of 7.3 and that there are a lot of negative reviews on this website. But compared with millions loving this and winner of 11 academy awards, those voices of discontent against this film are left in the shade. Arguably for me James Cameron's greatest film. Titanic is a true epic of colossal scale. The acting is brilliant particularly with Leonardo Decaprio and Kate Winslet as Jack and Rose. They light up the screen as the two lovers separated by social class but not love. There romance is so beautifully depicted that you can't help but smile. The romantic story set aside the sinking is flawlessly intertwined.Though the film is in two parts the romance and the sinking the first hour and a half gives you the chance to come to know these two characters and others like nasty Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) and LoveJoy (David Warner) who play there parts excellently well with great support from Kathy Bates who plays the lively Molly Brown. There are some beautiful and forever memorable scenes between Jack and Rose when Jack first sees her, the third class party, when they kiss on the bow of the ship, Jack painting her naked, when they make love in the car and when they are both in the water after the ship has sunk and Jack dies. All these scenes and others are amazing. The music score by James Horner is hauntingly beautiful and sombre and made me cry when you see the full sinking in all it's horror.And you do James Cameron depicts everything showing not just the sinking from Jack and Roses perspective but different people in different parts of the ship as they scream desperately for help. So you end up caring not just for the main characters but all the small cameo roles played by hundreds of people. Morality questions are raised about how things were handled by white star liner. These are haunting images that burn in your mind and stay with you long after. The most haunting scene is when loads of passengers are in the water and when most of them had died. The cameras focusing on one of the lifeboats coming back is the ethereal feel of a mythic force. Cameron creates suspense and tension at whether the two lovers will survive and you just deeply care about them. The costumes and ship itself look simply magnificent and are a wonder to look at. The end scene as well where the old Rose dies in her sleep and has the happy memory of marrying Jack on Titanic and when he dies in the water made me cry my eyes out and is one of the best scenes I have ever seen in film. Titanic is a epic film and James Cameron has shown this disaster in all it's horror and is a tribute to the victims of this tragedy. In 2012 there has been a rumour that he is going to re-release the film in 3D. It will be even more incredible no doubt (he proved that with Avatar) but it's the storytelling,which will recapture the myth of this fascinating tale that has been told throughout world generations. Even now as one reviewer Baybee from Austrailia quotes about Titanic the film.""This would have to be one of the most wonderful films of the 20th century and one that will never be forgotten""I couldn't have put it better myself. Even after watching this time after time the film still has that powerful impact of making me feel sad. Truly remarkable.",Titanic
302,lediscipledessocrates,A Hyped Misadventure,3,26 October 2014,"The movie in question revolves around the infamous shipwreck of 1912 where more than 1500 people lost their lives when the commuting leviathan sunk on its maiden voyage to the States. The movie made it big globally, had a great box office run and also managed to win a record of Academy Awards. The question, however, is – was this movie really that good? In my opinion, Titanic, while not intrinsically bad, is an overrated cinematic venture. For a disaster movie it was too foppish and the treatment of a potentially rich subject matter, not exemplary . There was a visible disconnect between the storyline and the intended tone of the movie. Mr. Cameron, the director of the movie, is known for his sci-fi ventures, while the present movie required a far more realistic and even subdued treatment. Strangely, the movie devoted more screen time to the on screen romance of the two lead characters than it actually did to the eponymous vessel, which diverted attention from the focal event- the shipwreck. The director could have downplayed the romantic angle and instead given the audience a few moments of pensive repose to digest the enormity of the tragedy being depicted. Cinematizing real life tragedy is never easy, and requires a careful treatment of subject matter. Though undoubtedly a visual stunner, replete with amazing special effects, something the director excels in, the movie somehow could not achieve the same penetration when it came to dramatization. Titanic suffered from sufficient thematic and directorial inadequacies to warrant only moderate adulation and not the inordinate ovation it surprisingly received.",Titanic

304,sandnair87,Titanic is A Fantastic Voyage!,9,14 January 2016,"The story of 'Titanic' is so good that if written as mere fiction, it would be dismissed as preposterous.In April of 1912, Titanic set out on its maiden voyage to the City of New York. 'The Ship of Dreams' as it was called, was a floating palace for the wealthy elite, reportedly 'unsinkable' by incorporating the latest in shipbuilding technology. After winning a pair of third-class tickets for himself and a friend in a poker game, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) looks forward to returning to his native America but finds himself drawn to a first-class passenger named Rose (Kate Winslet). She is the 16-year-old fiancée of Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) - a high-society gentleman that doesn't like to lose - returning from her wedding in Europe; a match of convenience pushed by her mother to bolster the family's faded coffers. After Jack's chance meeting on the ship's fantail with Rose threatening to hurl herself into the ocean, an unlikely romance begins. No sooner do they profess their love to each other, than an iceberg in the North Atlantic tests the character of everyone on board, from the ship's captain to the poorest of the poor as it slowly iceberg rips the safe, stable deck out from beneath the characters.Titanic is an extraordinary motion picture – a jaw-dropping feat of outstanding art direction, costume design and cinematography. The film captures the essence and decadence of the era, as well as the spirit and raw allure of the ship herself. Coupled with nearly seamless visual effects, James Cameron's Titanic feels like a wholly real creation. Instead of treating the Titanic as a microcosm of society, Cameron makes the ship a vividly realized, fluid symbol of human destiny, mapping the different levels of the ship as levels of character, from the social graces of the salon to the sexual heat of the engine room. Created through a complex blend of partial sets, models and digital effects, Cameron's Titanic is breathtaking in its wholeness, heartbreaking in its destruction. The film's final hour portrays the sinking, not merely as spectacle, but as a series of harsh moral choices that must be made by all the characters as they decide who will live and who will die. But perhaps, the neatest thing about his filmmaking is the engaging way 'Titanic' sucks us into what seems, on the surface, to be a magnetic romance, while underneath, there are dangerous currents of class consciousness and shoals of hubris. Yes, he does paint his story in broad strokes, and some of the dialogue is risible, but Leo and Kate sell the hell out of it, with their undeniable chemistry.Titanic isn't just a great film, it's a magnificent historical record of one of the most unfortunate disasters in the annals of human history, that is both poignant and personal.",Titanic

307,loza-1,A film that just can't win.,10,4 June 2005,"Judging by some of the comments I have read about this film from others: I would say that the makers of this film cannot win. If they did not try to get the get the actual historical facts right, I would be complaining. If they do, then the scriptwriters get it in the neck for not being imaginative enough.For my part, I thought that the rich girl/poor Irishman story was wonderfully woven into the plot. Through the eyes of these two lovers, we are given a wonderful history lesson. We are introduced to the British caste system. We know that there were motor vehicles aboard, because they consummated their relationship in a car. When the ship is sunk we know that people were stuck in the water for far too long before the lifeboats came to rescue them; and, that, as a result, survivors at that stage were very rare. People who castigate all the literary devices used in this film should really lighten up: they are educational devices.There may be a few things about this film that are historically incorrect. For instance in the trick photography scene, where the captain's cup of Russian tea turns into the ship itself, there is smoke coming from all four funnels, even though everybody knows that one of the funnels - presumably the one that capsized - was a ventilator.The only bit of real criticism would be the music. It might have been better if the music were more timeless rather than the transitory voice of that Canadian singer whose name I have forgotten already.",Titanic

309,Ibuk,Titanic - overlong and overrated,2,6 November 2007,"I may not make myself popular with this statement but I hate Titanic. One reason is that it is far too long for a Hollywood movie. It spends most of its time waffling on and on and on. I went to see it in the cinema when it released it 97, it didn't impress me then it doesn't impress me now. I have liked James Cameron's previous work like Terminator and True lies but he has really disappointed this time around.Now onto the good points. The last scene was so moving and the song My heart will go on is one of my favourites. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were very good in their roles.

310,Dragoneyed363,An incredibly beautiful movie that holds up on every watch,10,16 May 2008,"There are many who say Titanic is ""overrated"", ""over-hyped"" or some might inexplicably go as far to say ""boring"" and ""pointless"". The hardly arguable biggest blockbuster of the 90s, grossing near 2 billion at the box office and winning 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture, has attained some hate from people over the years, people who love to hate this movie for everything they so wrongly think it is not and never will be. It has, however, attained a very positive social status among a lot of people whom their hearts were captured by this masterpiece. Those people can see just how magnificent of a movie this really is, and how underrated a classic it appears to be in today's film society; a dazzling and striking accomplishment in itself and never overlooked, but unfairly maligned by many.The movie, aside from being set on the Titanic and called Titanic, actually has a love story that renders up most of the movie time, as most would already know. This love story, is positively brilliant in every sense of the word. I am always amazed and captivated to watch it play out on screen, because Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, who were furiously snubbed out of Best Actor/Actress awards, have wonderful chemistry, giving me chills in lots of scenes, and they both separately give incredulous performances that enthrall and charm every step of the way as well. These two characters' strong likability, along with James Cameron's directing and the entirely fascinating special effects make this movie something much more than mere entertainment. The movie is excellently executed in the best manner it could be, the Bill Paxton and Gloria Stuart present day story being very interesting as well, and a lot of the film's aspects are quite simply riveting and awe-inspiring whether it's the love story, the intensity in all the performances or the infamous, brilliantly portrayed sinking and sets that give true heart to the story of the Titanic and shows it's revelation quite undeniably like any other film on the subject.While ""My Heart Will Go On"", receiving the Academy Award for Best Original Song, has attained some criticism from people as well, it makes the perfect score and theme song for every scene it is used in regarding the movie, especially the climax, which has had millions in tears, had me in tears, and always has me in tears when I watch it, even if it is not the saddest movie of all time, because it isn't. It's a film about love, a film about disaster, a film about memories, and it is beautifully shown how all of those three attributes tie into peoples' lives, but I am not melancholy, I am merely pleased with how stunning of a film it is, and how remarkably well it has held up over the years, not being overthrown by any blockbusters in recent years in likes of quality, in my honest opinion. James Cameron, even if not one of my favorite directors, is very talented and it shows with this movie. I do not understand a lot of the reasons why so many hate this, or do not find it as remarkable of a film as fans like me do, but I ensure you, this movie will always have a place in my heart, and will go down as a classic, already has even and will contine to whether haters like it or not, because of how many people were touched by it and are still touched by it.

Besides the spectacular sinking of the ship, extras must have found this a bonanza, along with hordes of stunt persons.To such fine actors and Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslow, this schlock must have been a breeze, hardly up to the demands of their Shakespeare portrayals.The usual bit about the lower classes not just being as good but even better than the upper classes was predictable, of course.  I'm sure she'd just love tossing if beers in a pub for the rest of her life.Well, enough of this sarcasm/  I could go on, but you get the point.",Titanic
314,QueenMakeda84,Memorable Film,9,6 January 2005,"This film will go down in history as just a groundbreaking film, aside from anything else. When it came out, you wanted to see it. The way they advertised it, how could you not? We're all guilty of morbid curiosity and love the irony of a ship so grand in scale and deemed ""Unsinkable"" to so many could actually do the unthinkable and pretty much capsize. It fascinates all of us. James Cameron did an excellent job of pulling this together. They wasted a lot of water that some 3rd world countries could have used, but still a good job. I liked the flashback idea, but it's pretty obvious the chick woulda been dead in most real life circumstances and Kate Winslet doesn't play a convincing 17 year old girl.I liked the true ending of the ship. It actually went down in 2 pieces rather than in all one form as other versions have implied. It kinda makes this movie the definitive version in a way, because it broke the standard. The climax was for the men. To this day, all my boyfriend talks about is the guy hitting the propeller and spinning madly to his icy death. But, the love story was definitely for the women. It was a little pretentious to think that she would have followed this man in the 4 days that she knew him, but hey, that's Hollywood. Rose was a nice insert as a person in history, but it seems fairly fantastic today that this story would ever happen. Jack was a stupid twit of a man that had no prospects and we're supposed to believe that she would run away with this cat? Oooh, rich bastard who's hot or poor twit whose only appeal is that he lives under a bridge? Oh, the choices. His nomadic existence was suppose to charm us, but all I saw was a bum. And look what happened to him. He was supposed to be so used to cold water and whatnot and the boy froze like a fishstick. If I were her, I woulda went back to Cal and said, ""My bad about that spitting thing"".I loved the character of Mr. Andrews. A little stupid for wanting to die with his creation, but to each his own. I can't believe that people actually wanted to go down with the ship and kept playing music and whatnot. Absolutely saddening that they were missing the big picture. Ship sinking. Need to get off. I found the music inspiring and we'll always have Celine Dion's song to drag us back to 1997: the year it wouldn't stop playing. I never really felt the terror of being on this ship though. I found that people had plenty of opportunities to get off, but they were just too damn stuck up to try anything. Only the 3rd class folks you felt sorry for. They actually tried to keep them on the boat. You felt bad for them, because they were the ones that were gonna die, because of their low station. However, I didn't have sympathy for first class folks. And where were the 2nd class people? It was like they didn't exist. I guess they weren't instrumental to the plot, but I wouldn't have minded seeing them at times.And of course, we're all a little mad at the old lady dropping the necklace in the water. I know it's supposed to be poignant, but give it to the granddaughter or somebody. Brock should have gotten it. I felt bad for him because he was like the rabbit from the ""Trix"" commercials. Just let him have it for goodness sakes! He's only devoted his entire adult life to it. No, little old crackpot decides to toss it overboard. I woulda made her go in after it...anywho, good film over all. We'll all remember it when we're old as ""that"" film.",Titanic

316,jake-law123,An epic masterpiece!,9,7 January 2011,"This is considered one of the best made films of all time. James Cameron outdoes himself big time, but this won't be the last epic he ever makes. The story of the Titanic like you've never seen it before. Epicness beyond anything reachable.The story is told in a flashback perspective, with Rose Dawson, a survivor of the Titanic, telling it to a group of scientists, and her granddaughter, telling about her experience on the Titanic, leading up to the fateful night where it would meet its historical doom. It also circles around her life changing star cross love affair with Jack Dawson, (Leonardo DiCaprio) another person on the Titanic.Begins with one of the greatest music scores of all time by James Horner, and then slowly takes us back to the very beginning. Goes incredibly smooth with the camera movement, making each and every individual scene epic as ever. The performances are beautiful as ever, with Billy Zane, Kate Winslet, Gloria Stuart, and Leo DiCaprio leading a brilliant cast.The first half is getting everything acquainted on the ship, and introducing all the characters, and setting the plot. The second half consists entirely of the boat sinking, which is very graphic. The visual effects are mind-blowing, with excellent and detailed parts of the ship. The music, editing, and setting really capture every single feeling and thought raced through the actual minds of the real people.One of three movies in history to win 11 Oscars. The others being Ben- Hur, and Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King. I had to watch the movie five more times until I finally managed to without crying. Its a real tear fest. Almost everybody in this film is crying. Its depressing as ever, but in a good way. It brilliantly captures the terror of the people. Its hard for a film to do that. James Cameron wasn't screwing around when he made this. Everything in this movie is excellent. Nothing is in fault, absolutely nothing. Everything is 100% accurate!This film killed at the box office, which it well should have. Its a film that will go down in history. A film that nobody will ever forget, and will always cherish every little moment this film brings.",Titanic

So, in reality, a mixed bag. Hollywood has produced much worse and also had its honor pieces.

I'm generally a fan of Cameron and normally his writing is very good, but the sub plot to this film was appalling.  Why did Rose, who was meant to be English played by an English actress have a bad American accent.  Why did every Englishman/woman on the boat (which incredibly was an English ship you know, not American as the film tries to push) an evil nasty character.The acting was probably the worst in film history and the love story was so silly and badly done.  All the scenes on the boat looked like Hollywood stage sets.It's very disturbing that a film like this can win Oscar recognition.  It was bad enough that Braveheart won an Oscar, but that was much better than this.Film making and hype at its worst from a normally reliable director.",Titanic

The imagery is gorgeous and the story has such heart! It's still so terrible that this is a true event that has happened. I couldn't imagine being on the ship when all of this was happening. There are times that it was slow but other than that I will always love this movie. It will always be a favorite!

321,cdjh-81125,A Film Like No Other,8,30 October 2016,"James Camerons, Titanic is a film that everyone knows about and one that every movie fan will have to watch at some point and it's worth such praise as I found this to be a fantastic film with one of the best romances ever put to screen. By far the most admirable thing about this movie is the fact that it never drags despite being over three hours long that because they use every scene to fullest to either increase the chemistry between Jack and Rose or to get attached to the characters you know are doomed. The title ship looks incredible in this movie everything from the lower cabins to the luxurious cigar rooms look nothing less than life like. This first and foremost is a love story and that works for this movie it helps to give the eventual tragedy more weight to it and there's not a single second where you don't believe either of these to people aren't in love. You just feel like they belong with each other and need each other and it takes two exceptional performances to capture that. Leonardo DiCaprio is just perfect casting in this films he's incredibly likable and entertaining and hate to see him trampled over by the first class passengers. Kate Winslet though gave the best performance in this film you feel that despite the fact that she has infinite riches she feels completely alone and she portrays that perfectly and her final scenes with Jack are absolutely heartbreaking to watch. The final hour of Titanic is centred around the sinking of the ship and never have Tension and Desperation been captured quite like this every single scene brings a new obstacle or challenge and just gradually seeing the water rise adds to the tension all the more. There's a lot of scenes in this film where characters are only looking out for themselves and are leaving others behind to die but you don't hate them for it (except Cal) you understand their desperation and will to survive and the viewer has to face the fact that they would likely to things very similar in the same situation. This is however not a perfect movie it does have some flaws, for one a lot of the side characters, specifically the first class passengers, just have nothing to them their just their to be hate able and to give more obstacles for Jack and Rose to cross and more could have been done with them. I also think that their was no need to focus so much on the present day storyline it takes up to much time toward the beginning and should have kept all these scenes until the ending of the film and could've still had the same impact. Don't get me wrong this film is a commitment, it's not a causal watch but is still a unique one. It's got an amazing central romance and had some excellent directing and some of the best production design ever put to film. 86%/A-",Titanic

323,ScottAmundsen,Bloated *Epic* With Fictionalized Love Story,3,19 December 2010,"I detested this movie so much when I first saw it that I really wanted to give it one star, but as bad as I still think it is, it is fairly well-made and at least the technical department earned their salaries here (though quite frankly I thought that some of the CGI effects screamed ""FAKE!"" louder than the scale models used by Roy Ward Baker in 1958's A NIGHT TO REMEMBER). What sinks this movie for me (pun very much intended) is the fictional love story forcibly inserted by Cameron, doubtless with the cynical intention of attracting teenage girls. Which it did. By the millions.When Oscar time rolled around, Hollywood apparently decided that 1997 was the year to call the movie that made the most money *Best Picture,* to say nothing of the other ten Oscars it won, plus three nominations. Now I have not seen every movie ever to win the Best Picture Oscar, but of all the ones I have seen, this one has to be the least deserving of the honor.For starters, aside from the fictional romance, there is nothing new here. I made mention above of Roy Ward Baker's 1958 film A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, which is THE definitive dramatic film about the Titanic disaster: there are no fictional characters, no romantic heroes or heroines; Baker chose to tell the story plainly, in an almost documentary fashion that still carries a huge wallop fifty-two years later.Cameron's film, by comparison, though it is wonderful to look at (obviously no expense was spared, from costumes to special effects), is a curiously cold and uninvolving piece of work except for when Leo and Kate are on the screen. Cameron's fatal mistake was that he forgot that the Titanic disaster was a real-life human drama; Roy Ward Baker knew this, and his film, fully an hour-and-a-half SHORTER than this one, yet manages to show the terrible loss of humanity of all classes that terrible night. Cameron's film has little feeling for any of the subsidiary characters, with a couple of exceptions, such as a lusty Kathy Bates, delightful as the unsinkable Molly Brown, and Gloria Stuart, who at eighty-eight came out of retirement to play Rose at age one hundred-one.Unfortunately these bright spots are too far and few between in a much- too-long movie that cannot escape the fact that the central romance is uninteresting at best, and irritating at worst. Cameron shows a shameless disregard for his actors in this film. Leonardo DiCaprio is not the least bit convincing as a young man from 1912; he comes across as a typical California brat who grew up eating Sugar Pops. Kate Winslet, a terrific actress, is horribly misused here; left to her own devices, she often fails to find the right notes, most noticeably towards the end, when she and Leo climb the ship to the near-vertical stern, and she turns to him and squeals, ""This is where we first met!"" The line is awful in and of itself, especially in the context of that moment, but had she delivered it with tears streaming down her cheeks and a great deal of pathos, it might have been palatable. Instead she sounds like a teenage girl going to a high-school dance.There are a few other good performances in the supporting cast in addition to the two I have mentioned, but unfortunately they and the rest of what was a true-life story of hubris, heroics, class divisions, and self-sacrifice, are buried under the cheap date-movie romance that Cameron inserted. I'll give him credit for one thing: he knew that the love story was what would keep the viewers coming back; had he chosen to simply tell the true story, I don't know if the film would have sunk faster than the ship did, but it most certainly would not have gotten all the undeserved acclaim that it did.If you haven't seen A NIGHT TO REMEMBER yet, get it. Compare the two and see the difference honest storytelling can make to a movie.",Titanic
324,gws-2,"A wildly romantic, beautifully told story",10,8 November 2005,"I saw ""Titanic"" in a first-run theater in 1997 and loved it. I had not watched it again until today because I had made the mistake -- and it was a mistake -- of believing that the enthusiasm for the film came entirely from teenaged girls and desperate housewives. BZZZT! Wrong. I am a man of, ahem, mature years, and was deeply moved, both in 1997 and again today.The drama of this wildly romantic tale is greatly enhanced by the presence of the ominous tragedy that was the TITANIC disaster. Nobody uses visual images, enhanced by special effects better than James Cameron and ""Titanic"" is his masterpiece, it seems to me. Every frame of the film is beautiful and reflects the $200 million that were spent in making it.Now let's talk about why I think that this film should work for everyone. First, there is no real-life disaster that was more poignant than the TITANIC sinking, so the movie rises far above the romantic disaster genre because it tells much of the real life story of the tragedy. Second, the movie, ""Titanic"" is simply awesome to both look at and listen to. My enjoyment was enhanced because I got to see it on a big screen high definition TV and listen to it on a first class 5.1 home theater sound system. Finally, ""Titanic"" just works.

The laughable acting of DeCaprio. And finally, the cliche and often ridiculous dialog (In certain part of the movie, the chip was in climax-sinking mode, people were dying like flies.

Then it came out, blasted to number one at the box office, and received 14 Oscar nominations - so I felt I had to see it. Coming out from the cinema I had that wow feeling. The one you get when you're so caught up in what's going on in the film, that you forget about everything else. Three hours just flies by. In all, I've seen it three times at the movies and another eight times on video, and I still get that sense of awe when I see it.Titanic was a phenomenon. It's the sort of ground breaking cinema experience that doesn't come around very often. Sure, the script isn't the most original ever - it's almost structured like a daytime soap (poor boy meets rich girl, engaged to evil guy). But another classic like Gone with the Wind isn't exactly the stuff of deep thoughts either. What they have in common is that they're grand spectacles that give the audience 100% entertainment in an expensive wrapping.Love, drama, disaster, action, and suspense - something for almost everyone. All done by extremely talented and gifted people, who could produce a visual experience on a scale rarely seen earlier. And in the middle of this two lead actors with a chemistry between them so crucial in order for the story to work beyond its one dimensional characters.The film may have suffered a pretty severe critical backlash (just look at the rating here on IMDB), but there's a reason why it made almost twice the amount of money at the box office as the number two film.

333,jaddison383,An Epic Love Story LIke No Other,9,25 June 2007,"Titanic is probably the most unlikely successful films of all time. It really was no kind of provocative theme at center. It was quite simply an epic, and an epic LOVE STORY at that. Yet, this film went on to be the most successful movie of all time, both in the box office and the awards seasons.The movie does what many people thought would be absolutely impossible- It takes you back to the Titanic and truly captures exactly what it must have felt like when the ""unsinkable"" ship went down. Through a love story that moves everyone who sees it, characters that are diverse and fascinating, and probably the best cinematography ever put on screen, it makes you feel about this story in a way you've never felt before. And that's what makes it so amazing. It changed the way people looked at this story forever. It made them truly understand the tragedy of what happened that night.The acting is fantastic. Leonardo Dicaprio does a fine job and was very under-appreciated for this performance. However, the reason for that is because no one could take their eyes off of Kate Winslet. This movie made her what she is today. Her performance is still fantastic as you watch it even now. The movie was hers from the moment she came on screen.It's true that it is, at heart, a love story, but it's not only about the two central characters of Jack and Rose. To me, the real love story is about the Titanic itself. Before I saw this movie, it was an interesting story and that was all. Because of this movie, and the vividness it portrayed, it is a story I'll never forget. It's become a story that will never die in the hearts of people, and the movie is what truly did that. It changed the way that people thought of Titanic forever.I think Bill Paxton's character said it best right at the end: ""All my life I've thought of nothing but Titanic, but I never really got it until now."" I understand Mr. Paxton- I feel the same way. An absolutely fantastic film, and probably one of the best ever made. 9/10 stars! Jay Addison",Titanic
334,jonnyfendi,Be A Part of Historical Moment by Experiencing Titanic,9,25 June 2012,"A friend asked me, ""Will the movie look exactly the same as 1997s version? "". I spontaneously told him, ""Well, the ship will still be sinking."". Ha ha But seriously, it's an unforgettable experience and definitely worth seeing! James Cameron invites us to revisit the RMS Titanic and thiz time in 3D. And you know what? I still get goosebumps ever since the first 10 minutes I saw thiz movie. I admit that everyone can make a review on ""Titanic"", surely everyone has something to say about thiz movie. It's not just that the ship is gigantic but also literally big as a movie. The Director James Cameron did explore almost everything. The real tragic event with the latest forensic science and one of the most beautiful stories ever told. Thiz is the man who brought you ""Aliens"" (1986), ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"" (1991) and ""Avatar"" (2009). A simple adventurer Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) won a ticket in a lucky hand at poker for the journey of a lifetime, where he meets a desperate aristocrat Rose (Kate Winslet) who suffers anguish after being forced to marry a rich steel tycoon Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). The journey is going to change their lives forever. The other Cast members are Kathy Bates, Bill Paxton, Frances Fisher, Victor Garber and Bernard Hill as Captain Edward James Smith. The cinematography is splendid. What I do remember is the dynamic camera movements, the afternoon sunshine, the wind, the wave, everything! I'm always impressed by how they capture the moment of ""I'm Flying Scene"", when Jack teaches Rose how to step over the big ship's prow and spread her arms wide. The chemistry seems so natural and sincere. The love story is compelling in every possible way. It's like ""Romeo and Juliet"" kind of thing. ""You Jump, I jump"" is also one of my absolute favorite moments. Yes, we do care about Jack and Rose. The elderly Rose who is played by Gloria Stuart also deserves mention for her memorable performance. Stuart successfully brings the story alive with her powerful storytelling. The song from Celine Dion, ""My Heart Will Go On"" is not just great, but it's legendary! Once again, it is worth watching in 3D. Although thiz re-release version is the conversion result from 2D standard material to 3D, but it's your best chance to experience the magical wonder which feels like you're actually standing on the deck of Titanic. One day you can proudly tell your kids or even grandchildren that you saw ""Titanic"" in the theater. Yes, thiz will be a historic moment! I have to say, I love the ending. It's one of the greatest ending scenes in cinematic history. Spoiler Alert! After the elderly Rose passes away, in afterlife somehow she's young again and meets the love of her life Jack at staircase in the main lobby of the Titanic. Then they're just kissing. It's so sweet and overwhelming. The movie reminds us that nothing is eternal, but still a specific moment can be eternal in our hearts. So are you ready to go back to Titanic?

335,possumopossum,"So, Did It Sink?",6,8 December 2006,"Where is the suspense in a movie like this? Anybody who hasn't spent their whole life living in a cave knows what happens in this movie. I knew what would happen over thirty years before this movie even came out. The fictional love story between Jack (for once NOT played by Jack Nicholson) and Rose was a tear jerker, but a little over the top. Also, it seems like the producers/director of this movie used it as an excuse to promote class warfare. To give this movie its due, it is a good story, and that is what saves it from total mediocrity. The story is told through the eyes of one of the last of the survivors of the Titanic disaster, an elderly Rose. I highly doubt that the rich folks in this movie were the jerks they were portrayed in this movie. I give it a 6 out of 10, only because it is a good story.WARNING: MAJOR SPOILER AHEAD: It sank.",Titanic

But now, it was completely moved by it, and it was deeply imprinted into the memory. Even when the fireworks were set off on New Year's Eve, I saw the fireworks rising, blooming, and falling in the dark night sky. I remembered the distress signal sent by the captain when the Titanic was killed. The fireworks also rose to the vast starry sky, bloomed, and landed on the infinite sea. And the naive little girl on the boat smiled happily because she saw the beautiful fireworks. I still feel heartache when I think of it. People's feelings will always get deeper and deeper with age. After many years, the 11-time Oscar-winning ""Titanic"" can still travel through time and space and shake people's hearts.",Titanic
337,blazesnakes9,Tragedy and Love. An True Holllywood Epic.,10,3 July 2011,"One of the well-known ships that became an disaster at sea was the Titanic. It sank in 1912 on its voyage out to sea. Disaster struck when the ship hits an iceberg and cause it to sink. The passengers of the Titanic were trying to survive. Many of them died. Some of them were in lifeboats. Now, James Cameron brings back the mighty ship. In his film Titanic, a man named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He goes on the Titanic after winning an poker game. Also on board an beautiful passenger, played by Kate Winslet and her fiancé, played by Billy Zane. DiCaprio and Winslet fall for each other in love as the Titanic ventures out to sea. Then, the iceberg hits the Titanic and that is when chaos begins. Passengers are frightened as the ship slowly starts to sink. The ship's sinking isn't about the passengers screaming and panicking, but it gives an realistic dramatization of the ship. Real documentary footage of the real Titanic appear on the opening credits. Winslet's character Rose, now old, is played by Gloria Stuart, who remembered what happen that night. The movie's visionary of the Titanic sinking is wonderful made with the special effects. As for Winslet and DiCaprio, they have great performances as Rose and Jack. The film itself is a tragedy of what happened. Titanic is one of the best films of 1997. An great, true Hollywood Epic. ★★★★ 4 stars.",Titanic

339,IrisNo11,King of the Movie World,10,1 July 1999,"Well...everyone saw this movie!  Maybe not EVERYONE, but mostly everyone! I was impressed by this movie the first time I saw it in the theatres, and thank God I saw it in the beginning when it first came out before the movies became crowded by Leonardo DiCaprio and movie fans.  I loved the portrayal of the real-life wealthy passengers like the Unsinkable Molly Brown, the captain, John Jacob Astor, the Countess, just to name a few.  The set was amazing and took my breath away!  This movie really explains a lot about the whole experience of the famous Titanic, and when I see pics of it lying there under the sea, it's pretty freaky and scary.  It's like a ghost ship under sea, but above sea, and for those who were there, the ship was a real wonder!I thought it was very generous of James Cameron to have that special moment of silence at the Academy Awards back in 1998 when he was accepting the award for Best Picture, and who knew that a movie such as ""Titanic"" would ever come alive on the big picture.  This movie is dramatic, romantic, funny (in it's own way), sexy, and magical all together.  It's every genre mixed into one!  That's why I call this movie the best movie I ever seen in my whole life!",Titanic
340,InaneSwine,As perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get,10,18 February 2016,"""Based on the tragedy that spawned thousands of heartbreaking true stories, comes this fake one."" It's time to decide: was it insensitive and somewhat cheap of James Cameron to throw two made-up passengers who fall in love onto the ship? Or did these two characters offer the audience an anchor to hold onto as we are guided through the dreadful events of April 15th, 1912? Without a doubt, the latter. The fictional story of Jack and Rose never distracts from the tragic true story, it cinematically enhances it. We never ever miss the bigger picture.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.However, a Roland Emmerich or Michael Bay film this is not, as Cameron never allows the spectacle to distract us from the agony of it. Watching the Titanic being destroyed is not fun or, in its broadest sense, exciting - it's intensely distressing. Unlike most disaster films, it never feels like we're watching a crowd of extras on a film set flailing around. The lead up to the iceberg strike engages you so convincingly in the period, such that each person in front of the camera has been imbued with rich character. And when the ship sinks, it genuinely shocks you to see them go. For a good part of the sinking, Jack and Rose's fictional plight is quite sensibly placed to one side, giving us time to reflect on the truth and how it would have felt to be aboard the ship that horrifying night.So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.",Titanic
341,Rawal_Afzal,"""Love can touch us one time and last for a lifetime""",10,10 October 2015,"The greatest film in the history of mankind, the most engaging love story ever made, this film has mesmerised me like no other on the face of earth. After watching once in childhood I watched this on again at the very start of 2011, and have ever since watched it a thousand times. I am such a huge fan of this film that I have even dedicated a poem to it, consisting of 53 verses (a shame I have never shared it online fearing plagiarism, a fear quite justified given the number of fans it has online). I also watched it at a cinema when it was released in 3D, on the 14th of April 2012, either hours or a day short of the tragedy's 100th anniversary!Each time I watch this film I tend to stay quiet a few hours afterwards and usually have that heaviness in my voice; it just affects my like no other film can. Just to avoid looking like an emotional fool, I usually start a conversation with anyone who happens to be sitting next to me so that I don't end up being in tears at the scene when Jack dies.The great thing about the love story was the joy that you so felt for them. So many hurdles stood in their way, there were so many things to fear from, yet they bore every hardship simply looking into each other's eyes. It is one great display of what the power of love is and what love can make us do. They way they rescue each other from one situation to the other, and the way the whole story builds up, and that once in a lifetime tragic ending scene, it is masterly work by James Cameron.Besides that, the whole depiction of the way the ship sinks, the horror in the end, the way the people die by either 'slipping' from it or in the freezing cold, the panic shown at the time it hits the iceberg, all of it is pure brilliance!Lastly, it should not at all be criticized for not being historically accurate, as for that you better watch a documentary film. They had to put up a build-up to the disaster that it was.",Titanic
342,Keemshave,One of the best films ever made.,10,27 June 2019,"How could I not give this film a 10/10. Sure, there is some corny dialogue and some romance that gets a bit too sentimental for my taste, but that doesn't hold this film back from greatness. It's the best romance film ever made and will have you tearing up no doubt. Once the iceberg is hit, the film goes to another level. The already well established characters are thrown into this tragedy that had me glued to the screen. Cameron's production is far ahead of it's time and deserves all the praise that it gets. The ending is also something that really makes me think about life and death, as a philosophical thinker. Having a dreamlike state after death and seeing what you truly care about...meeting up with the ones you love...is heaven. It's such a beautiful ending and gives me chills everytime.",Titanic
343,ween-3,"""You're gonna need a bigger boat"". (see Jaws infra)",7,24 December 2000,"It's almost too easy to bash this film. So I'll just paraphrase what James Cameron himself said on TV one night about the ""pitch"" meeting for the film...""I got an idea for a film about a boat. It's about 3 hours long and nothing much is gonna happen for about 2 1/2 hours. Then everbody dies and there's no chance for a sequel. And by the way..it's gonna cost you about $200 million to make it. Whaddya think, guys?""Truth be told..the first half hour or so (the Bill Pullman stuff with actual footage) ain't bad, but nothing I haven't already seen on the Discovery Channel. I'll still take Cameron's ""The Abyss"" every day and twice on Sunday. The guy directs a pretty neat little action film. It's just that I like my disposable love stories served with a side order of humor..and maybe some actual ""acting"". You know. The stuff that actors do in movies? In ""The Abyss"", Ed Harris and the gang got into their characters enough to give the movie a nice kick. Leo and Co. are reduced to playing second fiddle to blue screen effects.And here's another shining moment for the Oscars. Ranks right up there with the Milli Vanilli Grammy Award in the ""What the hell were they thinking, anyway?"" category.",Titanic
344,loufalce,It Sinks,4,26 March 2005,"James Camerons Titanic has everything money can buy. This is a a big slick glossy ultra Hollywood take on the tragedy.We all know the outcome,so its no use repeating it here.This is essentially a shipboard romancer,not unlike 1997s far superior Out to Sea.only it is not supposed to be a comedy. The trite and hackneyed plot line involves an impossible romance between poor boy Di Caprio and socialite Kate Winslet and it its not totally convincing.One high spot is the always fine Cathy Bates as Molly Brown and shes good almost too good for this movie. Scant little detail is provided for the events that lead up to the tragedy.Unfortunately,the real star of this film is the Titanic itself.It is wonderfully recreated in all its glory. Even though it is only mostly sets with plenty of CGI details it is incredible. You almost feel like you are on a real ship.That being said, you probably enjoy this film if a good cry is your thing. This film won many Academy Awards, as many as Ben Hur but it did not deserve that many. It is also the highest grossing film of all time(so far} There is also a rather insipid title song by Celene Dion. Yet in spite of all its technical excellence,1958sA Night To Remember remains the definitive version of the story and stands head and shoulders above this. Nearer thy god to thee, indeed!",Titanic
345,axismladen,Great but far away from being the best!,10,17 September 2009,"In 1997 when i was a kid,my mother took me with her to watch the Titanic.Boy,what a stressful experience that was.I'm there,sitting,surrounded by the whole bunch of grown up's crying the world out of them selves while Jack's giving the speech to Rose about how she's gonna die old in a warm bed,with a whole bunch of kid's and everything!I was so confused i didn't know should i laugh at 'em or should i cry with 'em.Back then i liked this movie.I found it to be among the only drama's that didn't beat me to death with boringness.Maybe it's because there is actually a lot of action in the film.Maybe not gun shooting action but a whole bunch of people running all over the ship in order to save them selves.Anyway,a couple of year's later,i've seen it again.In that timeline between the first time and the second time i've seen it,i became a huge movie lover.I really started to watch movies.And then when i saw it the second time,i still thought it was great.Far away from being the best one but still great.In the mean while,i talked to some people about movies and some of them,not many but still some,told me that Titanic is by far the best movie ever to be made.Man,that irritated me so much that i really started to hate Titanic.And since that time until two month's ago i never seen Titanic.When someone would mention it i'd instantly freak out.Then a couple of month's ago,i talked with this guy about some thing's and we came to the subject of movies.We generally agreeded with each other,he is a man that saw many movies and know's what he's talking about so it was a pleasure talking with him.Anyway,he mentioned Titanic.I instantly freaked and said that it suck's!Then he said that it's a great movie,not the best but still great and that i should rent it.I instantly refused.Then one day,i was at this store that was about to close in a couple of day's and i've seen some movies were selling at a law price.I instantly went home and took some money and then i came back to the store.I bought my self a whole bunch of movies.Though,only a few of them was left because the prices were lowed a couple of day's earlier an i didn't know.Anyway,movies i bought were mostly from the twenty first century because all the classics were sold.However,i accidentally spoted Titanic and i thought,what a hell it's cheap,why not give it a shot.And so i did.I bought it and i've seen it again.After i've seen it,i must say,i was surprised.I really liked it.Even though,it freaked me out at certain part's such as the ending because it just wasn't logical.Couldn't Jack and Rose switch so that he would be on the raft for a few minutes and then she again and so on...That way,they'd both stay alive.Another thing that bugged me is that i honestly doubt that Jack would be willing to give his life for her when he knew her for no more then ten or fifteen day's.If i was Jack,I'd push her of that raft so i could be on it.Jack saw it first,anyway! To bring conclusion to my comment,Titanic deserves to be on 250 list considering that Kill Bill and many other's are on it too.However,it's still far away from being better the such movies as:The Godfather,Pulp Fiction,The Deer Hunter,Braveheart,Schindlers List,Seven Samurai,Lotr,Dances With Wolves,Forrest Gump,It's a Wondefull Life,Ben Hur,Goodfellas,Reservoir Dog's,Gladiator,Hannah And Her Sisters and so on,and so on.....",Titanic
346,heyimmyx,Immy's review : I think about this movie a lot,10,27 September 2020,"Titanic is one of those movies that stays with you for life. Sure, the romance could be soppy at times, but this doesn't deny the fact that this movie is a masterpiece. Never have I seen a film with so much vigour and passion, entirely devoting itself to the horrors of that one tragic night. The movie is an experience rather than a viewing ; You get so involved with this isolated society at sea, as well as the characters, relationships and barbarity they experience. Firstly, it's worth praising the astounding set production, design and costumes. These all helped give us a beautiful, classic image of people at the time, as well as the splendour of the Titanic. The movie makes full use of its editing and cinematography to help convey the story in a more personal way. Every emotion the characters experience, we experience too, and this is largely thanks to the filmography. For example, the last half of the movie when the Titanic is sinking, utilises effective editing and videography, from its suspenseful action shots to the more sombre and touching scenes. The performances were mostly good. Unfortunately sometimes I did find Kate Winslet's acting slightly annoying and over melodramatic, although the screenplay could be widely to blame. Leo was impeccable with his cheeky demeanour and charming looks. It's to be said that Leo and Kate have captivating chemistry throughout, and I have no distaste in saying this is one of the greatest love stories ever told. The movie had set up Jacks and Rose's romance so well in the first half, and we had become so attached to their story, that by the second half we are completely glued to our seats and praying for the survival of the two main leads. In this sense the movie is very clever in sucking us into the relationship between these two characters. I loved the movies strong focus on the different treatment of the upper and lower classes, whilst exposing the egotistical and narcissistic nature of rich men like Cal, thus commentating on the unfairness of social class. His character was very well written, as he comes across as incredibly intimidating and possessive throughout *shivers*. It amazes me how a movie based on the Titanic has come to create a entirely different story of its own. The last half of the movie is what truly makes this a masterpiece. The sinking is told in great detail from beginning to end, portraying the slow descent into chaos and death. The atmosphere was filled with tragedy and sorrow, and never faltered in keeping us gripped the entire time. The mixture of sadness, despair and loss of life makes this an incredibly powerful yet disastrous look at the sinking of the Titanic. This movie succeeds because of the profound and overwhelming mixture of emotions we experience. We laugh, we despair, we swoon, we cry ; The movie transports us right into the action as if we were there. Overall, although this movie has problems, I can't deny that this is a staple in global cinema and is extremely enjoyable. I will never forget my first time watching it, as it was the first time I had ever felt so strongly about a film. It would be rude for me to rate it lower than a ten. Highly recommend!",Titanic
347,Tommy-92,"Has its flaws, but in my opinion was pretty good",7,15 September 1999,"Yes, it was wildly over-rated, in that respect serving only to inflate Jim cameron's ego.  Yes, it is certainly not the best movie ever made.  Yes, the script was weak, and the acting isn't really too wonderful.  Leonardo DiCaprio has the blandest, most obvious lines I've ever heard, does not act them very well at all, and basically suvrives only on his smile and the fact that everyone knew millions of teenage girls would be swooning.  I didn't understand Billy Zane's character, but he wasn't on very much, so I didn't have to be confused by him a lot.  I do think it's awful that all those girls cried only over ""Leo"" and not over the thousands of people who died, but for those who were watching for another reason, there is still a pretty good movie there, in my opinion.  The scope is amazing, with all the sweeping shots, lavish, mostly accurate details, and spectacular effects. Cameron really orchestartes the mood of every scene wonderfully; though some of it is pretty cheesy, for the most part I really was caught up in it. While the acting isn't spectacular, as I said, some of the people turn in pretty good performances.  Kate Winslet did for the most part, though in the action scenes, where she's given the role of hero, instead of doing something with it she just pants away and screams for Leo and does nothing else.  Otherwise, she handles the acting pretty well.  Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates, the captain, the designer of the ship, and the many third-class passengers were also good.  Even though the movie focused on fictional characters and not on these people, there's enough there to really affect you.  Seeing them being so cruelly and unjustly shut up in steerage and not being allowed to get to the lifeboats is a pretty powerful scene.  And just tell me you weren't in some way moved by the mother singing her kids to sleep, the old couple (who were real) hugging each other in bed, the people getting shot and killed by smokestacks, the captain shutting himself in as the windows break, and the band playing on and on and on.  I mean, come on! This really happened!  It was the most affecting part of the movie for me. I guess it was because I was so affected by it that I felt sad when Leo went under.  All the nay-sayers concentrate on the fiction part, which admittenly isn't up to the standards of these scenes, but also is not the only thing there.  Perhas if people just didn't look at the first part and only at the second part, they'd understand one reason why this movie was so successful. Yes, the teenage girls were a big factor, or so we hear, but plenty of other people went two and three times besides them, and they went because they were so affected by it that they just had to see it again.  Maybe it doesn't deserve to be the most successful movie ever made, but it deserves to be a classic, and undoubtedly will be no matter what anyone says.  Yes, it has flaws, but what movie doesn't?  There's more to this movie besides those flaws, if you just look.",Titanic

Luckily she met Jack. She quickly regained her vigor from powerful Jack. They unavoidably fell in love.However life was unpredictable. Due to huge body, Titanic could not adjust promptly its direction so that it collided with the iceberg. ""Unsinkable"" Titanic was sinking. An unexpected tragedy happened.

349,Chrissie,Diminishing returns,4,10 April 1999,"I forget what prompted me to see Titanic for the first time -- I think it was a comment I read in an article by a Japanese man who said he was moved by the bravery of the men putting wives and children aboard lifeboats and telling gallant lies to comfort the little ones.See it I did, however, and I was so visually stunned I entirely missed how lousy the movie was.I went to see it a second time because my son had been reading about the Titanic and wanted to see how the sinking was depicted. This time I noticed how lame the characters and plot were.I went to see it a third time because a friend of mine who doesn't have a car asked me to bring him and offered to treat me and my kids to popcorn and sodas, and pay for our tickets, if I'd take him. That last time I left the theater absolutely outraged.Titanic is a sorry example of the moral decay of western civilization. Characters we were supposed to sympathize with were elbowing women and children out of their way to save their own miserable skins. Instead of reaching out to help the woman clutching a baby, Kate and Leo reminisce about the night they met. Leonardo hefts the worthless and shallow Kate onto the floating door to save her life, when he could have saved a dozen innocent children instead. Titanic was a monumental ego-trip and monument to selfishness. The only sympathetic characters were the designer, the captain, and the Irish widow with the two small children. I could smack Cameron in frustration -- imagine what a wonderful plot he could have built around this woman and Kate's shallow character! Picture it -- the widow flees Ireland to join her brother in America after the town rich creep offers to save her from poverty at the expense of her virtue. The widow sees Kate on the railing and gives her a picture of what suffering really is. Take it from there -- it can go in any number of directions far more interesting than the cookie-cutter lust story. Pathetic.As I told my kids on the drive home from the theater, ""If you every survive a shipwreck by ignoring the cries of drowning children, don't bother coming home.""",Titanic

No one will ever forget easily to Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater three days romance that ended with tragedy.  Even tough many critics said that `Titanic' was nothing except a piece of shallowly and cliché crab, but James Cameron proves that he could manage a wonderful tale of love and one of the most disastrous event that ever happen became one in a magnificent visualization story telling.

352,CurtMan@LVCM.com,Still Stands The Test of Time,9,21 October 2004,"I am simply amazed that such a popular, beloved, critically and audience acclaimed film favorite as ""Titanic"" could sink so unseemly in the minds of so many who shelled out heavy sums of money and lauded it heavily at the time of its tremendous popularity. While ""Titanic"" is hardly as fresh, riveting, and entertaining as it was when I first viewed it several years ago, it still certainly retains a special distinction in the realm of cinema, at least in my assessment. Perhaps the screenplay is overly blase, full of clichés, and historical blunders, and the spectacle and sheer horror of seeing hundreds plummet to the bottom of the Atlantic is not as harrowing as it seemed in theaters, yet ""Titanic"" is still a fine, worthy, and sensational cinematic triumph. ""Titanic""'s technical aspects: its impeccable mix of sound and visual effects, dramatic and potent musical score (detract the obsolete ""My Heart Will Go On""), ingenious costume design, absorbing cinematography, and of course the gorgeous, stupendous design of the ship, still stand well above many efforts in cinematic history today, and are plenty appreciated and admired. The romance between Rose and Jack is perhaps the most cliché and nauseating aspect of the film, which, despite the film's perception as being ""extremely overrated"" might be ""Titanic""'s primary detractor, and that would be fully understandable- if these same critics weren't the ones who rushed to the cinemas to embrace the romance in the film! Overall, ""Titanic"" is a leviathon of a film: boasting popularity and critical acclaim and some really brilliant cinematic aspects, where it somewhat lacks in the script and the romance. I have probably viewed ""Titanic"" over 100 times, and though its value and enticement has been compromised through numerous viewings, it still retains a laudable, important distinction as providing both rock-solid entertainment and brilliant cinematic quality, and these features are too complimentary for such a film as ""Titanic"" to sink through history. ***1/2 out of ****",Titanic

355,n-mo,"Shame, shame, shame on you, James Cameron",3,21 July 2007,"I will not accuse this of being the most over-rated film I've yet seen, because, first, it has its share of redeeming qualities, and second, that honor has to go to The Illusionist (which in many ways was actually a lame attempt to ape the Titanic formula, but I've already blasted that one into the ground). Neither can I fault it for grossing so much: a film that shamelessly panders to over-emoted teenage girls is bound to produce a good showing at the box-office. But the fact that a sloppy period piece that insults the period it pays tribute to could earn such lavish sycophantic adulation from nearly all reviewers (especially celebrity film writers) is just more evidence that America's thought-élitejournalists, politicians, and academics alikehave got to be the most degenerate, gullible, and monolithic in the Western world.There are two intertwined reasons why Titanic is on balance worth seeing: the historical setting and the special effects. Enough has been written on the latter, and on the former, as well, but as an Atlantic historian I cannot express enough love for anything so exquisitely and meticulously designed floating on the ocean of my heritage, just around the time my family was making its way over from Europe. Older Rose's remark that, ""It was the ship of dreams. And it was. It really was,"" ring so true. I beseech my readers: regard the volume of immigrant ship traffic in the era, admire the interior of the ship and the costumes of the passengers and contrast them to the most luxurious modern cruise liners, in an era where ships are often not a necessity, and consider how much the Western world lost in less than a century. (This sort of aesthetic history lesson is the same reason I love Chariots of Fire.)Regard, admire, compare and consider... if, that is, you can get past a script that hangs together like a soggy potato chip and pays not the least attention to real historical personages.Our two protagonists are at best naïvely laughable and at worst totally unsympathetic, their antagonists little more than cartoon characters. That the former speak like modern teenagers is quite appropriate, because they clearly ARE modern teenagers pitted against the backward old fogies of the era. Jack is a romanticized Bohemian bum with little that could possibly seduce a beautiful young Anglo-American socialite away from her privileged life. Rose wants us to believeand she convinces Jack, somehowthat deep down she's some sort of fiery rebel, yet what I saw was a girl alternating between doing the bidding of her wealthy, domineering cardboard-cutout fiancé Cal and the bidding of her impoverished, sappy, cardboard-looking loverboy Jack. There's so much ham and cheese at work you'll want to take a fork and start eating.And there is something utterly vile about their story, which, again, is clearly aimed at adolescent females, and that fact makes Titanic's moral tone all the more disturbing. This is a film with an agenda: all the authority figures are stupid murderous bigots, the 17-year-old heroine is glorified for rebelling against her mother and fornicating with a wild rover, and don't forget that wicked cabin church excluding third-class passengers from attending the Sunday service on that fateful last day of Titanic's voyage.In reality, the whole ship was completely segregated. I am told church services were excepted, though I have my doubts, but not because of snobbery on anyone's part. Third-class passengers were largely immigrants without medical certificates and in that era of the great migrations, were required to register at Ellis Island; hence U.S. law required complete segregation on all inbound European ships. And, on these grounds, it scarcely needs saying, such a liaison between Jack and Rose, far from stupid and implausible, was quite impossible.Finally, despite the segregation, Doug Phillips has pointed out, ""there is no credible evidence that first-class passengers were given priority seating rights. To the contrary, there are numerous accounts of first-class passengers giving up their seats and assisting third-class passengers into lifeboats.""There are plenty of other factual gaffes, many of them less severe (such as the bad British accents), but by far the most appalling is the libelous depiction of the ship's crew. There is no evidence that William Murdoch accepted bribes from a cowardly aristocrat, nor that he shot two men, nor that he subsequently committed suicide, and so far as I know, such a portrayal was a completely ad hoc invention on the writers' part. (James Cameron's apology to the Murdoch family was too little, too late.) The surviving passengers testified that the crew performed their duties sacrificially and heroically that evening. That is the biggest sin of this film: the real heroes of the Titanic tragedy (with the exception of Thomas Andrews) are washed over or even villanized in favor of capricious brats, only one of whom gets his comeuppance.Even so, towards the ship's final gasp of life, we do get a good sense of the imminent terror not only in Jack and Rose, but in all 1,500 souls who perished that evening. The worst moment had to be the power outage: it's those last, frightening milestones on the road to destruction that remind you where you are headed irreversibly, and the scene of the actual sinking captures this perfectly. The true story of the RMS Titanic, from its building to its sinking, and even its aftermath as grown Belfast men whose labor on that ship had been the pride and joy of their city wept in the streets at the news of her demise, is beautifully tragic and inspirational. Would that this film had captured more than a few minutes of that.",Titanic
356,R_O_U_S,"Near, far, wherever you are...",9,17 February 2004,"OK, the biggest film of all time.  Let us remember that it was good.  It looks astounding, even now.  It takes the already good A Night To Remember and improves upon it.  The much-derided love story works for me, I'm sorry. In fact, the one bad thing anyone had to say about this in 1997 was that the dialogue wasn't up to scratch.  Excuse me?  How many quotable lines? `She's made of iron, sir.  I assure you, she can sink.' `I'm the king of the world!' `We are dressed in our best and prepared to go down as gentlemen. But we would like a brandy.' `You unimaginable bastard!'  This film is a true classic in the old-fashioned sense of the word.",Titanic
357,nzpedals,"Scary, and a realistic semi-documentary",7,6 July 2015,"There are three stories here, all very well written and produced. We all know the basic story of the ship the Titanic, but Cameron's depiction of the actual events is so much better than any written account.We see the captain, we see the doubts as he weighs up the pressures he is under from the ship owners, and the publicity people. Then, later, he has to face the reality that his ship is going to sink and he is probably going to die, probably unpleasantly. And we see the ship's designer and builder. We see the officers and the crew and all the problems they face and how they react. Sometimes well, sometimes not. We see the wealthy first-class passengers and their life of luxury, now they face death and can't do anything about it.The production of all these events is impressive, walls bursting, floods of water, people sliding down the tilted deck, falling off. Then we see the horrible sight of the lifeboats as they search for anyone still living in the freezing water. So graphic, as is the first scenes of the modern attempt to recover items from the wreck, especially the way they explain to Rose what physically happened. Clever.I suppose most viewers will concentrate on the story of Jack (Dicaprio) and Rose (Winslet). But this part, although very well done, is quite ordinary, just another love/lust story. He saves her life, she saves his later. Not many standout scenes or dialogue for either of them.The third part of the story is Rose, 84 years later. The casting by Mali Finn is great. Gloria Stuart is a recognizable older version of Rose and including her joins many of the events throughout the film. Very clever, well done Mr Cameron.",Titanic
358,TheNabOwnzz,Massive in scale but little in actual substance,5,13 July 2018,"It is quite easy to be swept away by Titanic's outstanding cinematography or exceptional musical score, and as a result a lot of its obvious flaws and faults seem to be overlooked. As an objective viewer however it is quite obviously an unfortunate disappointment.As stated before the cinematography in Titanic is fantastic, with a lot of widescreen shots of the ship from high angles. A couple of scenes such as the attempted Rose suicide near its start or when the final part of the ship goes down do look pretty bad and fake though, but for most of the film it looks pretty beautiful. The indoor set design is also amazing, and it basically breathes 1912 to look at its elegant and artistic design. The musical score by James Horner is also ( as to be expected from him ) a beautiful emotional piece that seems to fit extremely well in Titanic. However, while it is a very stylish film this way, it doesn't manage to be impressive on the actual substantial aspects of cinema, such as its acting or its screenplay, which are both very inconsistent to say the least. Billy Zane, Kathy Bates & Bernard Hill are some examples of actors/actress who do show a impressive performance, but Kate Winslet as young Rose has this monotone emotionless look on her face all the time, and i find it hard to see what Jack ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) sees in her because of this. Winslet is not capable of acquiring the emotional intensity that is required for a role such as this, since her acting is so theatrical and not very natural. While DiCaprio is a fantastic actor, he seems to be struggling in every scene in Titanic, primarily because he is simply miscast. He is not the type of actor for a supposed heart tugging romance, and he is thus unable to truly capture the essence of their bond. ( For an actually GOOD young DiCaprio role, watch the Basketball Diaries (1995) )Unfortunately James Cameron not only wanted to direct, but also write a film as grand in scale as this one. This results in a pretty mediocre screenplay and dialogue that a kid could have come up with. Titanic offers little sub text, symbolism or depth since its writing is sub par to say the least. There are a lot of corny moments and cliché dialogue ( The entire scene of Rose discovering Jack's talent for drawings for example ) and all the while it has very little subtlety and it is unable to tell the audience something without blatantly having some character saying it, which in itself is ofcourse an insult to the audience's intelligence, and it results in Titanic being quite a poorly written movie that is not intelligent and most of the time just plain dumb.The first part of the film seems more like a social commentary instead of a film, as Cameron tries his best to show the audience what a bunch of snobbish unlikeable & arrogant folk the rich people are, and how outgoing and free the poor people seem to be. This might not have been so bad, if Cameron actually managed to be subtle in this matter, but this was not the case, as for example Billy Zane's character Cal is such an unsubtle way of telling the audience that the rich are bad. Ofcourse no offense to Billy Zane, who was great as his character, but his entire character is utterly ridiculous and he is unable to perform a single likeable action throughout the entire film, and this never changes. We get it Cameron, the rich guy is the bad guy, no need to shove it down our throats. Cameron's greatest mistake seems to be the decision to write the movie himself instead of bringing in an experienced screenplay writer.The second half of the film is more of a disaster movie, and it isn't so different from your average modern day monster blockbuster, except the monster in this film is the water. Even if there were any hidden meaning behind the first half of Titanic, the second half contains no depth whatsoever, and shows us the demise of a lot of characters nobody knows and nobody cares about. In the end we don't really care that much about Rose and Jack either, since their acting was not up to the challenge and the dialogue provided by Cameron was not fantastic either. It also shows us multiple instances of weird moments of self sacrifice, with people sacrificing themselves for no obvious reason instead of trying to escape. While this might be realistic in a film about the Japanese bushido code, in Titanic it feels out of character and it just doesn't fit, since these are all normal people who should want to simply get on with their lives.Cameron might show some images to impress the audience with his take on this real life tragedy, ( The opening scene with the old footage of Titanic actually setting off with Horner's score is ofcourse fantastic ) but in substance Titanic is severely flawed and the experience of watching it is therefore less immersive which in turn makes it lack the emotional impact it should have had.",Titanic

361,the-gossip-king,Cameron's MASTERPIECE!,10,20 December 2009,"For me personally this film goes down in my top four of all time. No exceptions. James Cameron has proved himself time and time again that he is a master storyteller. Through films such as Aliens, The Abyss and both Terminators it is clear that he was a brilliant and confidant director as far as action and science-fiction goes. He sees a story and adds a strange quality to the film. But Titanic is so much different to his other strokes of brilliance. The film is exceptionally moving and allows room for surprises, plot development and interesting character developments in a story that everyone knows. The story of the famed voyager sinking on her maiden voyage is legend so the challenge was for Cameron to make a truthful, interesting and entertaining film about it. The acting is wonderful as Leonardo DiCaprio who plays Jack and Kate Winslet who plays Rose became superstars overnight with the release of this film and in most films I get annoyed when the supporting characters aren't given a lot to do but in this film it is more purposeful because as an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart) tells her story it is quickly apparent that it is Rose's and Jack's story alone, no one else. Emotionally it is entirely satisfying and can leave no dry eye in a theater or home. The music has become iconic and legendary. It is composer James Horner's finest soundtrack ever and evokes so much from the film and the audience. The song after so long has become annoying but I still appreciate it for the phenomenon it is and this film is. Only one problem, the usual James Cameron problem, is the dialogue which is memorable but in a bad way as in how cheesy it is at points but all that aside. James Cameron has delivered a masterpiece and a romantic epic that sweeps you away on a journey of a lifetime. My heart won't go on from this one.",Titanic

But what I'm sure that audiences didn't expect was a plot as deep as it gets. With an amazing and large cast, Titanic offers more teardrops then a funeral. One thing that stands out over everything else is the fantastic musical score by James Horner and Celine Deon. Possibly the best since Hans Zimmer in the Lion King in 1994. Titanic released in 1997 changed cinema as we know it. Offering a deep, and emotional story with performance you will enjoy with your eyes, and music that you will be humming for years to come. Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, and Kathy Bates are amongst one of the largest cast in film history (up to that point).

If there wasn't some much said about it, I probably would have liked it more. Frankly, the dialogue and much of the plot was silly.

364,StonedMagician,Excellent: 9.5,9,27 July 2019,"So many romance movies come out these days, and so many of them have characters, stories, and relationships that are hopelessly difficult to care about. Who could have guessed that James Cameron, known for highly visual works like Terminator and Aliens, would create what is in my mind unquestionably one of the greatest love stories ever? If I had gone into Titanic blind, I certainly wouldn't have. I will get the few real flaws out of the way first. Leonardo DiCaprio, as great as he is in this film, is forced to yell commands to Rose a bit too much. And the 3D is a gimmick, nothing more. However, to my knowledge, this is the only way to experience this film in IMAX, so for me at least, wearing the glasses was well worth it. Though I'm sure I am overlooking some, that's about it for the bad. On to the good. Firstly, I hope that the rerelease of this acclaimed film will remind directors of romantically-minded movies everywhere of how to do it right. James Cameron starts the film in the present day (or at least, it was when it was released), with an expedition to the titular wreck overseen by an enthusiastic explorer (Bill Paxton). He finds a bunch of papers in a safe on the ship, and restores a drawing of a young woman naked, wearing only a necklace. This sets into motion a series of events leading to a three hour long flashback detailing Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet, played in the ""present"" by Gloria Stuart), and her passionate relationship with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). I could type for hours about how well-acted, emotional, and real this pair seems. I won't, but suffice it to say that all acting awards were well-deserved. For the bare majority of the film, Jack and Rose are in the spotlight. The length of the film actually works to its advantage, because ample time is given to see how their relationship springs, wilts, and ultimately blossoms. Jack is a lower-class man, and even he makes no bones about it. Rose is from the opposite end of the spectrum, and hates it. Jack finds he about to commit suicide over her marriage forced on her by her mother. The moments the two share really sell their relationship, enough so that the audience becomes invested as well. Class differences are an extremely prominent issue, brought up again and again. At one point, Rose reminds a frantic crewman that only half the ship's population can fit on the lifeboats. Her husband-to-be overhears this, and replies ""the better half."" The rich are not painted in a sympathetic light. They are arrogant, selfish, and terrible people that throw others off just to have themselves a little more space. Cameron goes this extra mile to ensure that we are sympathetic with Rose. She is forced to walk among these horrid humans, and finally, stumbles upon someone that treats her as an equal, and in an almost husband-like manner, as opposed to her stuck-up, borderline misogynistic fiancee. After almost two hours of engaging, superb relationship-building, the inevitable iceberg looms. This, of course, is where James Cameron's signature technical brilliance kicks in in full force. Metal is torn asunder, flooding commences everywhere, and there are many grand exterior shots showing the Titanic going down. All of which are done with excellent special effects that look as real as any of the characters in the midst of them. This is also where the movie becomes incredibly, brutally honest about what probably happened once the ship began to sink. Hundreds are shown drowning and falling, including children. The rich shun the poor, literally kicking them off lifeboats. SOS signals are sent, and fireworks are launched. And, in what could be the greatest scene in the film, four string instrument players lament the catastrophe the only way they know how. And through it all, Rose and Jack find each other through the worst of it, and stay alive until the last possible moment. James Cameron's work in this film is truly extraordinary. He is not known for crafting compelling characters or stories. However, in these respects, he succeeds brilliantly here. In modern romance films, characters and their tribulations are about as genuine as cardboard cutouts. Cameron has created a set, populated it with characters that fill it to the last inch, and bound it all together with great attention to artistic and technical detail. I left trying to sort out what I liked most about it. I haven't yet decided, but I knew then and know now that I have seen a beautiful masterpiece from the unlikeliest of sources.",Titanic

366,darin-wissbaum,Not without flaws...,7,6 August 2009,"The special effects of this film are some of the best I have seen in a movie. The great Titanic slipping under the waves, the people staying aboard for as long as they can, the individual stories of the famous people that were really on the ship (Molly Brown for example), The Capitans refusal to slow the ship down due to iceberg warnings and so on. Most of us know the story of the great liner that sank on that cold April night. Taken as that alone James Cameron's film is a masterpiece. You really feel like you are on the real Titanic with the people of the time. The problem I have with this film is Leonardo DiCaprio. Say what you want but I feel he was mis-cast. He does not even try to act in a way you would expect a man of 1912 to act with his squeaky voice, saying things like horse-^*@% and I know how the world works. In other words he acts like he just came from a day at the beach. Kate Winslet is better in her role as Rose Bukater but I would have preferred a different actress. She plays the part mostly as someone who needs to grow up. The love affair between the two main characters is not believable and serves only as a distraction. Granted just showing the history of the famous ship with the people who were really there would have been boring for most young viewers without some modern story they could relate to. In this case a cheesy love story. Aside from that this film pretty much works. I watched it for the story of the Titanic and the actions of the crew that night, and the mistakes that were made that lead up to the disaster. Cameron crafted this part of the film so you felt that you were really there. Jack Dawson and Rose Bukater seemed out of place....",Titanic

Everyone knows about the Titanic and the travesty that transpired, but people often forget about the lives of those involved and the experiences they endured. The story of the Titanic, the infamous ship, and two starstruck lovers, who were merely forgotten, displays vast beauty in an otherwise unfortunate event. From the characters to scenery, this movie captivates the audience with its enthralling imagery and emotional acting. Stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet perform incredibly in their respective roles, and demonstrate that going against the status quo is not necessarily bad. Throughout the film, viewers are taken on a journey. One that begins with Rose happily accepting Jack into her life, and then Jack tirelessly trying to stay in it. To say Titanic is a romance is an understatement. It possesses action, adventure, drama and all the like, and is far from your generic love movie.

I will not be jumping on the trendy 'let's bash Titanic, because chicks like it' bandwagon, because when I went to see the film in the theater I was blown away.  The emotional impact alone of the ship sinking made this film worthwhile.  I was moved and the real tragedy of the event was brought home directly.  Now, on videotape, this is not anywhere near as grand, but it is still quite decent.The love story was not really anywhere near as bad as people say, I think that both Winslet and Dicaprio have done decent films and will continue to do decent films.  In retrospect, I am sure that Titanic will not be remembered as their best film, but it will probably be their most remembered.  I was less touched by the romance than I was by the sense of history (small 'h' history) that the framing of the story provided.  It was a nice love story, not a particularly great one, but a nice one.  However, the scene at the end, when Rose goes back into the ship and meets Jack, still young and handsome, is a nice touch and a moving vignette.While I will not claim Titanic to a brilliant film, or a deep film, it was a beautiful film and I still enjoy watching it.",Titanic

Once you've seen the film the first time, it's opening scene and music immediately drives you to tears and they don't really stop for the next 3 hours and 14 minutes. As clichéd as the story of jack and Rose may be, a name had to be given to the faces that we lost in this preventable tragedy. And what a powerful love story it is. To have loved so deeply and passionately in such short a time and have it stay with you forever is what everyone wishes for themselves. A lot of flack is given to Cameron's script, and while it could be have been better, it certainly wasn't laughable. Winslet and DiCaprio gave incredible performances with what they were given and this film will truly stand the test of time, due to its powerful gritty nature.

371,matlefebvre20,Review of the highest-grossing movie of all time,10,9 October 2006,"So many things have been said and written about the movie ""Titanic"". And well before it premiered in theaters around the globe. After all, it's not everyday that the most-expensive movie of all time is released and it was James Cameron's first theatrical release since ""True Lies"" in 1994, three years before ""Titanic"".Since its release in December 1997, ""Titanic"" still is a talking subject. Not necessarily in family reunions, but in film, it's an unmissable. Not only it was the most expensive movie ever made, it also became the most successful and that title still remains up to that date.The storyline is very simple and doesn't break any serious ground, but every guy who only has a small knowledge in cinema knows that story by heart and even the main characters' names.The story begins in present day, where a group of researchers led by Brock Lovett (played by Bill Paxton) explore the Titanic's wreck and discover the portrait of a nude young woman wearing a huge necklace. When she learns of that discovery by the means of her granddaughter's TV, an old woman named Rose reveals to Mr. Lovett that the lady in the portrait is none other than herself.Old Rose is brought to Lovett's ship and tells the story of what happened in early April 1912. Young Rose (Kate Winslet) is a late teenager from a wealthy family and she is engaged with Cal (Billy Zane), the heir of a big fortune. However, Rose doesn't love neither Cal, nor her very reclusive lifestyle and dreams of freedom.She's planning to suicide until she meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), an American street rat who makes portraits of nude women and sells them for living.This is the typical premise for a romantic story: the two less-likely people who could get together meet themselves. They are in a two-class difference (Rose 1st and Jack 3rd) and, at first, they don't fit much each other. But the more they pass time together, the more they realize that they're made to be together.The first problems for that couple is evidently the fish-out-of-water situations. Jack is a poor guy who temporarily finds himself in the high society of the time and Rose, who voluntarily wants to get out of water, spends time with Jack with the other 3rd class passengers whose lifestyle is very different from the 1st class one.But the biggest problem happens next. Because when you say 'Titanic', the first thing that should go to your mind is 'iceberg'. This is where the special effects wizards enter into action. And it's at that moment that you see why this movie cost more than what a third-world country has for all of its people.The sinking is the best part of the movie. It's more thrilling, more exciting and more visually-dazzling than the best action blockbusters made by Jerry Bruckheimer or the like. The spectacular views of people falling from the top of the ship, the blowing furniture, the water infiltrations, the frozen bodies floating on the ocean... All of that stuff earns my best regards.The movie is also an epic because of its representation of the early 20th century society. During all of the movie, there's one thing that's never in doubt: it IS 1912. The high society is well shown by the 1st class cabins, the costumes, the ballroom, the majordomos and the like. That kind of stuff could easily be grabbed by an history teacher to show how life was in 1912.It's just impossible to hate ""Titanic"". Simply because there's something for everyone. Those who love romantic stories will definitely fall for the Jack-Rose relationship. This is strongly due to the actors' performances. It is not DiCaprio or Winslet's first acting roles, but that kind of hyper-budgeted movie is what was needed to show their talent to the world. And they don't waste their time. DiCaprio is charming (tell that to young girls) and professional, while Winslet delivers the greatest acting performance of all.But one actor that is often forgotten is Billy Zane. His interpretation of Cal is very strong and has unfairly been locked in the closet. He's very aggressive, tyrannic and egotistical. That's exactly what's needed for the third side of the love triangle.Those who prefer spectacle will have to wait until the middle of the movie to see the Titanic's sinking but it's worth waiting. It's time that you don't see passing.Those who like history will definitely be pleased by the movie's sets. It's like a travel in the past. Cameron used to be a science-fiction specialist but he works astonishingly well in any time period.Everybody should approach ""Titanic"" like if they know nothing about it. Because I did and I'm glad I did. I know some people who can't stand such mass publicity made about a guy with an Italian-sounding name and the mass budget allowed for that movie. But if you defer your judgment for a moment, you'll see that ""Titanic"" is one of the finest movies of the decade and the greatest disaster film of all time. Because there's nothing more stupendous that a catastrophe that really happened.",Titanic

I personally find it to be the greatest movie I've seen, the Academy Awards seemed to think it was a pretty damn good movie, the critics when it first came out weren't too harsh and movie-goer's truly expressed how the general population felt about Titanic with the gigantic ticket sales.Now, however, Titanic makes the ""overblown movie"" lists from several critics, endures extreme mockery and the ridicule of anyone who actually admits to liking it. This may have been due to people wanting to be different from the norm in 1997 and maybe this attitude never went away and too many people fell victim to it. Or maybe it was the cheesy scene's people like to imitate over and over which obviously must mean the entire movie is cheesy. However, I recently watched Titanic the other day and I'm going to say why I find it to my favorite movie of all time.The ship Titanic itself expressed a mentality during this time period in which humans felt they could overcome Mother Nature. With the sinking of this ship it made people truly eat the words ""Titanic is an unsinkable ship.""With the character Rose, a first class passenger you are exposed to the arrogance high society had. Rose also opened your eyes to the luxuries high society had and how woman were truly trapped and were seen as second-class citizens. Rose almost committing suicide helps hit home how truly horrible it must have been for woman during this time period. The dynamics between Rose and her mother also show the dynamics between how woman had to behave and in a sense how they survived in this society.With the character Jack, a third class passenger you are exposed to how large the gab between the rich and poor was. How first class dogs went down to be walked on the lower decks, how it was the poor who actually built Titanic and how it was the poor who were treated truly unfair on Titanic just because of social status, which helped express the mentality of the time.Having these two characters meet and expose the viewer and each other to these different lifestyles helped truly put into perspective the mentality of what this time period was like. Sure, it was in a way a clichée love story, two people from different world's falling in love. But regardless of it being typical it still exposed the different classes in a way that truly made you realize how it was for people back then. Also, many things are cliché' for a reason, they most of the time work and have been shown to work time and time again.Without this love story you would have just come away with the basics of this story, the Titanic sinking. But this love story created sympathy in which you felt for Jack and Rose. It made you truly feel how the people on the Titanic were feeling at that exact moment. Families, loved ones and friends were being torn apart. Without the emotion created from the love story you wouldn't have felt nearly as sad or seriously towards what had actually happened to these people.As for it being morally wrong on the part of Rose. Well, she was trapped by her mother and society. The man (Cal) whom she was getting married to proved to be inconsiderate towards others, was very mean, rude and thoughtless (even before he knew of the situation between Rose and Jack). He deserved and was asking for everything he got. What Rose did was what many do in youth and sometimes you have to take what life gives you at that moment. That's exactly what she did and people shouldn't say her actions were immoral. They were done out of love at first sight and out of vengeance towards the arrogant class she was apart of.Titanic was very authentic and very historically accurate. It did include a lot more then just the love story. It had information about the lifeboats, the binoculars, how exactly it sank, the famous people aboard the ship, and numerous other things. Even things such as the first-class band and their situation, what exactly was sung on the last time day light hit the Titanic at the morning church gathering, increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings and many more examples were all little details included in this movie which made it far more then just a ""love story"" if you actually paid attention.One of the major flaws people say this movie had was the acting. I however thought it had amazing acting and I saw nothing wrong with it. Acting is something that is hard to pin-point in terms of being good or bad. I find it an easy way to attack any film. If you say the acting is bad, you cannot really ""prove"" to that person it was good. Acting is something that just goes to personal opinion and you cannot really change someone's mind on it. I personally give an A+ for acting and even the script. But one thing to consider is that many shots could only be done a few times or even once because of what they had to do to the sets, making it sometimes hard to get the perfect take.Overall, one the best movies ever made.",Titanic
373,emfern13,Worst Movie of 1997,1,7 December 2001,This movie is complete rubbish. It is two hours too long and it has terrible acting in it. The ship was the only thing really impressive and Kate winsletts boobs. But Leonardo Dicaprio was totally miscasted for the movie. The love story is pathetic. The sinking of the boat is also quite impressive. But Pearl Harbor has much better effects than this. This movie stole a whole bunch of academy awards.,Titanic
374,eamon-hennedy,SUPREMELY WONDERFUL!,10,27 October 2003,"James Cameron really knows how to put on a show. T-2, The Abyss, True Lies and Aliens, all of his films have been hugely enjoyable, rich in epic scope and emotional flavor. Whether it be science fiction or in this case an historical disaster film, he really knows how to create rich epic entertainment and with Titanic he has probably made his finest film artistically. Sure, there are  many who don't like the film , historians will go 'tut-tut' which they always do anyway at any film based on historical fact, but Cameron makes his interpretation of the Titanic disaster work so well, mainly because he knows how to tell a story really well and he is a master at creating suspense in his action sequences.The first half of Titanic in undeniably moving. The love story between Jack and Rose may have every cliche in the book (the jealous fiance, the evil mother in law, the tug of love between lover and family) but let me tell you Cameron can make these cliches really work here. The epic scale puts it above sheer soap opera and with fantastic performances from Winslet, Zane and even DiCaprio, Cameron really makes the love story work from a story telling point of view and a visual one. The way he presents the first kiss on the bow, to the drawing of a nude rose through to the love scene, Cameron makes his finest film, and if this were just a period love piece it would be enough, but as this is about the sinking of the Titanic he has more aces up his sleeve and he creates the most moving motion picture in many a decade. Not since the days of David Lean has a love story been presented in such a way, and when that iceberg comes, Cameron mixes love story and historical disaster in the most fantastic way which ensured that audiences responded in their droves.Sure this is not great art, it is a Hollywood blockbuster, one, like Gladiator (it too a fantastic film) that takes the audience back to the good old days when big budgeted blockbusters had a great plot as well as superb special effects, and with Cameron at the helm we are getting the best of both worlds. All of this culminates in some of the most moving scenes in a mainstream Hollywood film I have ever seen. They are not manipulative. They are well written.This is a superb film on every level. Well done James, you have done it again.",Titanic
375,hcalderon1,The Ocean Adventure,10,25 February 2005,This movie was awesome. This movie begins as people were hoping to go to America to be U.S. citizens and were boarding on the biggest cruise liner that would take them to America. Titanic was known as the ship that would would never have the problem that developed along the way to America. This starts as Leonardo DeCapro(Jack Dawson) makes his way on the ship by a lucky business. Everything starts off well on the ship but when Jack falls in love with Rose things did not start off right because Rose's parents were favorable about them seeing each other. Rose's fiancé tries to make things very complicated for Jack but Jack keeps trying. A few weeks into the cruise the liner develops that horrible nobody can imagine. While trying to make it safe off the ship Rose's fiancé tries everything to stop them from getting off the ship together. I enjoyed seeing this movie. To see if Jack and Rose make it safety stay tuned.,Titanic
376,fred-houpt,Monumental drama,10,23 March 2007,"Mea Culpa: I had not watched the film till this week. But, I finally sat down and watched it over two nights. I know that Titanic aficionado's will be picking the movie apart for any mistakes and for me that's not important. I don't care enough about the ship and it's history to worry about such matters. I just enjoyed the drama for what it was, even if it was weaving quite a bit of the story out of thin air.The visual impact of the film is very powerful, with the sets giving the viewer the believable impact of watching the real thing, the original ship. The special effects were as good as I've ever seen. Again, the way the ship moved, looked like, flooded, broke apart, all those things looked very real to my eyes.The dramatic love affair is of course the hook that grabs you and it is hard not to be carried away into the sadness without your heart feeling like it has been hurt. It is a very sad story, even if it is made up (I don't know and don't care if it is). There is enough tragedy in the real story of so many people freezing to death in the frigid North Atlantic or drowning for one to feel sad. Just as a drama, I found it very entertaining and emotionally effective. Kate Winslett is gorgeous, sexy and wonderful to watch. I have noticed in almost all the films I've seen with her....that she fills up the screen with a great deal of light. Not only is she beautiful, she exudes youth and energy and in this film she is a delight to behold. Leonardo Di Caprio is wonderful and I have yet to see him in a film that I wasn't captivated. He is, like Johnny Depp, a delight to watch. This is a film with a large cast, especially the many stunt actors, who must have really suffered a lot of hours in cold water. It's a larger than life story and the film delivers. Well worth the 11 Oscars. Excellent and I'm really glad to have finally seen it. A keepsake. This is what blockbusters are supposed to be like.",Titanic
377,jebyvyson,Greatest movie in generations,10,4 May 2019,"I know this is the best (overrated) movie of all, so I watched this film...it earn its place as the best movie of all time. The visual surprising still holds up for a movie that came out 2 decades ago, the music score is the best thing I ever heard, the cinematography is beautifully shot, and the tone of the movie is very lovable and emotional. Watching this for first time is such a blast, but sadly, I won't have that same feeling again if I go watch it again. This movie is very memorable for generations to come.",Titanic
378,mrbluto,One of the best 20 movies of all time,10,20 June 2001,"I kept putting off seeing this movie with my wife because I labeled it a chick movie,I was so very wrong, Titanic has well written characters and a story even though we knew the ending keeps you on the edge of your seat through the entire three hours. There really was a Rose on the Titanic. The critics of this movie only have to look at the fact that is made almost 2 billion dollars world wide when no movie have ever made more than 900 million,this Titanic amount of cannot be just from teenage girls. Titanic is as close to a perfect movie as has ever been made. I give it a 10 and put it in my top 20 with the likes of the Godfather and jaws.",Titanic
379,de_niro_2001,Fabulous!,10,20 January 2007,"I can't understand why this film has come high in polls for the worst ever film. It is very well made and won 11 Oscars. It is far better than the old films about the disaster. The acting is excellent and the effects take your breath away. It wouldn't have been any more realistic if James Cameron had commissioned a shipyard to build a full-scale working replica of the ship. The film is very authentic with just one minor lapse, namely the American locomotive and rolling stock on the dockside railway seen in front of the Titanic in the view from the pub. Unlike previous films about the Titanic there is no sense of impending doom throughout the film. There is a good feeling in the first half of the film, with scenes like Jack and Fabrizio at the bow watching the dolphins while Captain Smith looks on paternalistically and the ceilidh in steerage that Jack takes Rose to. James Cameron conveys the sheer size and stability of the ship very well and the audience is drawn into the very deep security that the passengers felt. Everybody on board is very friendly apart from certain individuals in First Class. Cal Hockley is a violent overgrown spoiled brat monster child. In a lot of scenes, particularly where he shoots at Jack with a handgun, he is reminiscent of the caddish upper class villain in a silent film. Jack has been criticised for being too 1990s but the rest of the cast look and act right for the period. The crew talk authentic sounding Edwardian English. James Cameron has caught the feel of the period very well and he has said that the people in the film are in many ways not that different from us today. It's fair to say that Jack and Fabrizio are like a couple of gap year students hitch-hiking round the world. Kate Winslet, with her full curvy figure which has got her a lot of period roles and the nickname ""Corset Kate"" is spot on as Rose. The scene where Jack sketches her nude is very touching and the piano music that accompanies it is lovely. When they run past the stokers one can feel the scorching heat of the furnaces. After the ship strikes the iceberg the audience has much the same incredulity as the passengers and most of the crew that there is a possibility of the ship sinking. The sinking, as it was in real life, starts very gradually and becomes progressively more terrifying. Although there is no blood or gore shown it still is horrifying. The only blood during the sinking are the scenes where the stewards get punched. There are some really sad scenes during the sinking such as the drowned woman floating in the water and the Irish mother telling her children the old Celtic story of Ossian and Niamh. It is sad when Fabrizio is killed by the collapsing funnel and when Tommy Ryan is shot by First Officer Murdoch in the heat of the moment. Incidentally, 20th Century Fox sent one of their executives over to Scotland to apologise to the people of Dalbeattie, Murdoch's home town, about the way he was portrayed in the film. One really feels the freezing cold when Jack and Rose are in the water and I felt sad when I saw the dead baby in its mother's arms. When I saw the film in the cinema I can remember hearing a couple of girls crying during and after the sinking. James Cameron says he deliberately made the ending ambiguous and his answer to the question of whether Rose dies or is dreaming at the end is ""You decide"". I think she died and went to Heaven and was reunited with all these people she'd known on the ship. It is a beautiful scene where she's reunited in Jack and she's all in white like a bride. Hey! I'm going against my own principles. I'm one of the most unromantic guys in the world! I'm not supposed to like these scenes!",Titanic
380,lopcar1993,The most amazing film I've had the pleasure of seeing!!,10,6 April 2009,"some movies don't live up to their hype, some don't even live up to be movies. But this; this one does that and so much more. James Cameron's Titanic tells the story of Jack Dawson a poor and down on his luck painter who scores tickets for passage on the ""Unsinkable"" Titanic, there he meets Rose Dewitt Bukator. Rose is traveling to Philadelphia to marry her rich snob of a fiancée Caledon ""Cal"" Hockley, and on the way the two become fast friends and soon fall in love. For those of you who have heard the story or haven't heard of it at all this is the movie to watch. All be it it's not a hundred percent accurate but it does well with telling the tragic story of the titanic. The Titanic is a monumental achievement of film making at it's best and also one of the highest grossing film's of all time, It's a beautiful film with great heart and soul; you feel every emotion that's in the film love, joy, angry, sorrow ,fear and anguish. Titanic is a romantic film that no other in the genre can follow or surpass, it's an amazing love story and tear jerker all rolled up into one. James Cameron creates a beautiful and breathtaking scenery and magnificent special effects in a film to end all film's. Titanic is one of the greatest film's ever made and will continue to inspire people to believe in fate, and in love.",Titanic
381,AmyJenson1995,It should be called 'Iconic',10,24 February 2015,"When this picture came out in 1998, I was only a toddler but this movie will always be among my favorites. Each time I'm watching it, I'm always taken by the same array of emotions and it never changed. I'm still as impressed by the CGIs and the impressive work the staff accomplished to make this movie possible.Thanks to them, The Titanic, this gigantic British ship supposed to be unsinkable but did anyway during her ill-fated maiden voyage, came back to life and we can see how beautiful she was. Being able to recreate her to the smallest detail is certainly a great achievement and the result is as amazing as they could have imagined. It must have taken an incredible amount of research hours to reach this level of realism. The success of the picture is also the ones of all the people involved in this project. The sinking scenes are masterfully done but don't fell in the 'too much' view we always see in nowadays Hollywood movies. It's spectacular without being exaggerated and more interesting, James Cameron didn't take freedom with history.But the focus is not on the Titanic which is just the setting for a wonderful romance between Jake (Leo Di Caprio who is just so cute) and Rose (Kate Winslet who was the incarnated grace), two young people who weren't supposed to be together but fall in love and fought for survival together when the ship sinks in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. This romance looked like a fairy tale, It has everything to be a wonderful one: two young lovely people, who met on the ship unexpectedly, fall in love despite their rank differences (Jake is from common people, he is poor and succeeded to get on board thanks to a poker game. Rose is from the high bourgeoisie, a wife to be promised to a rich but jealous industrialist but is boiling inside by all the rules and etiquette). But when the ship collided with the iceberg and start sinking everything change and both Jake and Rose will try to survive together in a freezing Atlantic Ocean waters. What a powerful story.Today, 17 years after its release, Titanic is still a movie we are talking about. Some love and others hate but this movie is still in memories and I'm sure it's not willing to fade away. Leo and Kate are renowned actors and shoots with the greatest. And me, I'm still overwhelmed by the huge emotions this movie brings me. It's one of the kind and will have always a special place in my heart.",Titanic
382,Zycho-3,I Still Can't Stop Thinking About It.,10,30 August 2000,"I am sick of people saying this is a bad film. Get used to it, this was a breathtaking journey, it deserved all its 11 Oscars and all its success. I am extremely surprised that it isn't in the IMDb Top 250.I liked everything about this movie, the performances from Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Frances Fisher, Kathy Bates and Billy Zane were all impressive, but this time, the performances aren't the sparkle in the film. It is really the effort that went into the direction, visual effects, sound and sound editing and musical score that made the film such a sparkling, memorable gem.This is the best film of 1997 no doubt, and after which will soon be 4 years, I still can't stop thinking about this amazing achievement.Rating: 10",Titanic
383,Theraxorterminate,"The most overrated movie of all time? Perhaps yes, but I will always find this beautifully done and well-crafted on it's own good.",8,14 November 2013,"What more could you say about Titanic? Well maybe a 100 million things more about it? When it comes to Titanic you'll always think of the vision and directing of James Cameron. And even though the whole story upon the disaster isn't 100% accurate I still think James was able to give a beautiful and strong directing not only the suffering and fear of the sinking but the love with Leo and Kate too. Basically Titanic is a more adventurous and maybe a little modern look on Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet. And I think it worked good to show the beauty of the ship and the love.The acting is beautiful, I didn't see any actors who felt forced or even ignored the ways how James wanted to do as he visioned. They take it seriously without anything that seems like they didn't wanna do it. Leo gives a very good performance as the unknown boy who tries to help the desperate girl to feel more alive. In my opinion Leo does not look too boyish on this performance, no in fact he really showed to be like a man. I still enjoy his acting to this day, now when he had turned more macho than ever. Kate gives a good performance that shows the feelings from someone who's rich but still there's many things she can do in her life.The special effects are gorgeous, they don't look fake at all and even looking on Blu Ray it still looks realistic with a little improvement on certain scenes. (Don't worry I don't think James Cameron will be the next George Lucas because these changes are very minimal on some material that were unnecessary to have or something that was missing.)Sure Titanic is long and does not exactly have the most original story, but everything else is just perfect for it's ""recreation"" of the ship, the special effects and the acting. And yes it's true that there are still many people who dislikes or even hate this movie. Many people these day's seems to forget that the word ""hate"" is much harsher than ""dislike"". The movie is certainly not the world's greatest film of all time. Is it the worst? No, but certainly very overrated and even though I have heard many of my family recommending it I wanted to take a look on the movie on my personal vision and take a calm moment and concentration if the movie really delivers. And yet it did.But in case for those who are wondering I like or love many other movies than this. I understand that people who had heard from the positives that you really need to see this and the result for them they become flabbergasted or annoyed. But then, why should we always manage to see a movie that won for best picture when there are hundreds of other great movies out there. So don't feel so forced about seeing Titanic, see it when you really have time to see the whole of it but ignore also those who praise it or hate it, that's what I did and it felt better.",Titanic
384,Umar Mansoor Bajwa,Great but Overrated !,8,11 May 2000,"The 1997 version of this great tragedy is a very entertaining and meticulously crafted movie. The whole plot with a romantic story makes it very likable among the youngsters, especially.The detailed depiction of the interior of the liner with so many opulent and richly decorated halls and passage ways is indeed commendable. The tragic accident and events leading to capsizing of the liner with the passengers and crew caught in the iron hands of fate are all picturised with stunning craftiness.However, the cold and cruel ocean is shown too placid and calm against the backdrop of the sinking ship and floating corpses. I wonder if the open seas and oceans resemble the same. This is the only cinematic drawback which has resulted due to the filming of this top grossing movie in a swimming pool.Finally, the story, the whole disaster and tragedy does not cover as wide a scope and magnitude that it be crowned with eleven Oscars. The juvenile love affair between Jack and Rose does not encompass the maturity of character and therefore cannot be very engrossing or appreciative.",Titanic

386,JamesIan2021,An Unforgettable Epic,9,12 May 2015,"Undoubtedly one of the greatest adventures of all time, an already great movie now even more spectacular in 3D. This whopper of a movie spans three hours of beautiful sets, incredible visuals and a stunning cast who deliver performances so strong that you immediately connect with their characters. I'm not one for love stories or romantic dramas but Titanic is simply a must-see, as it's blend of love, adventure and loss is incredible, and James Cameron is a master in suspense building. A few friends of mine say that they skip the first hour and a bit and just go straight to the sinking part, I told them that's ridiculous, and the reason being is that you won't care about who dies or the outcome at the end, you have to watch the whole movie, it's a breathless adventure that will live on and be remembered as a classic. Everybody knows the story, but now it's been re-mastered in 3D and it's even more alive. The moment you see the Titanic the crowds look even bigger as they sprawl alongside the docks, cranes lift boxes which appear to lift off the screen and the sweeping shots that pan over the ship are just incredible. The depth throughout the movie is vast and jaw dropping to look at. All dialogue scenes boast incredible spacing between every little object from cups to candles, and I love the scene where Jack holds Rose over the edge of the Titanic and holds her arms out, you can almost touch them, this is the best 3D conversion to ever grace Blu-Ray. He nailed Avatar in 3D, Sanctum was a stunner in 3D and now James Cameron has done it again. Then there's the climax, probably the most memorable and stunning climax in cinema history: The sinking of the Titanic. The scale here is mind blowing, as thousands of sailors and passengers flee in terror desperately trying to get on board the life boats, fighting for a space. I like how human nature and morals have been shown in this climax, how the crew leave the lower class people behind the shutters to drown which is saddening, and the greed and desperation of the upper class people fighting to get off the ship. The 3D here only heightens the terror, when passengers look over the sides the depth effects enable the viewer to tell just how far down the fall really is! The corridor scene where Rose and Jack try to flee is a marvel in 3D, don't get me wrong the 2D counterpart is spectacular still but the way the water seems to leak our your TV screen is frightening. This whole finale will have you on edge, once the ship itself tips and sinks the depth just goes into overdrive, look at the distance from where Rose hangs dangerously to beneath her. I will highly recommend this movie in 3D, if you are lucky enough to get your hands on the Blu-Ray like me then you are in for one hell of an experience. I don't really cry at movies, it takes an awful to get me weeping, even in real life situations but Titanic is a master tearjerker. For the last hour I honestly balled my eyes out, the soundtrack and score is wonderful as that peaceful vocal echoes in nearly every key scene. The four violin players stay to play their final performance as the ship goes down. The Captain goes back to wheel to go down with his ship. An elderly couple lye in bed as the water floods in. A single mother reads a bedtime story to her kids as their side of the ship goes down. Once the ship goes down more sad sets in. The sound of Rose frantically trying to shout for help, and when she lets go of Jack the tears start flooding in. This climax is hard hitting, lump-in-throat inducing and one heck of an emotional payoff. It gets sweeter when Old Rose drops her necklace into the Ocean, and when young Rose names herself Rose Dawson. This is as best as I can describe the beauty of the end. This classic story has never felt more alive, a fantastic conversion and still one of the epic movies of our time.",Titanic
387,Danimal-7,I loved it. So sue me.,9,8 October 1999,"TITANIC provoked polarized reactions from its first screening.  For many, it was the greatest movie ever made; some patrons were reliably reported to have seen it more than thirty times, and it became by far the highest-grossing production in cinematic history.  But a fairly large minority of people, both in the average film-going public and among the critics, felt that the TITANIC craze was much ado about nothing, and many of them bitterly resented its bloated budget which they felt could have gone to far worthier films.  Two years after its release, the ardency of TITANIC fans is no longer quite so hot, but its detractors seem to grow ever more bitter, and thus a backlash has snapped out against the movie that has driven it from its former place at number one (!) in Internet Movie Database voting to a place completely off the top 250.  It's become passe to like TITANIC, but I still like it.  A whole lot, in fact.  And while I don't think it ever belonged in the #1 spot, ranking it below mediocre stuff like THE PHANTOM MENACE (#199) or FORREST GUMP (#172) just isn't fair.TITANIC is the story of two fictional passengers on the White Star Line's most famous vessel.  Rose Bukater (Kate Winslet) is the child of a family high in social class but deeply in debt; Rose's mother (Frances Fisher) plans to rectify this by betrothing Rose to the rich but odious Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a penniless dock-worker who has won his ticket on the TITANIC in a poker game.  Rose, having gotten a good look at just what her future with Cal Hockley will be like, attempts suicide, but is stopped by Jack, which sparks a brief but memorably passionate romance between them, under the shadow of the disaster we know awaits the ship.If you had told me in 1996 that James Cameron would direct a movie which had no violence or chase scenes for the first two hours, I would have laughed in your face.  I honestly had no idea that Cameron was capable of gentle scenes so rich with humor, affection, and grand spectacle.  The greatest ship ever launched comes to life and we get the grand tour, from the massive, throbbing engines to the graceful swanlike prow.  We get a sense of just how grand this voyage was for all participants, rich or poor.Leonardo DiCaprio shouldn't have been the sole focus of this movie's popularity.  Not that he does a bad job; he always delivers Cameron's sometimes strained lines believably and sincerely, and he does some fine work in a difficult late scene where he has to mix fury and love in the same moment, simultaneously kissing and berating Rose when she stays with him rather than flee in a lifeboat.  But Kate Winslet's performance is the real meat of TITANIC.  Her large liquid eyes can be heart-melting when she wishes.  She perfectly simulates the mixed embarrassment and joy she feels as Jack teaches her to break down the inhibitions that her class and upbringing have placed on her.  And at one point she delivers a kind of ""stuck for words"" expression that is so perfect that she couldn't have done it better if she really had forgotten her lines.Billy Zane has a comparatively easy job as the villainous Cal Hockley, it's a one-note role, and Zane plays it that way.  While he's certainly not the most interesting villain ever to appear on screen, comparisons of him to Snidely Whiplash are unfair.  Hockley is not motiveless; he is merely one of those men who thinks of women as property rather than as human beings. There are millions of Hockleys in the world today, and you can see the wreckage they leave in their wake in any battered women's shelter. Hockley's character is perfectly realistic, just not particularly deep.My favorite supporting actor in this movie was Victor Garber in the quiet and understated role of Thomas Andrews, TITANIC's shipwright.  Of his many fine moments, the best is his reaction to Bruce Ismay's anguished protest, ""This ship can't sink!""  ""She's made of iron, sir.  I assure you, she can."" Almost any other actor handed that line would have delivered it with contempt and sarcasm.  But Garber does it more with a mixture of disbelief and real pity, as he realizes that the man he is facing is emotionally incapable of facing reality.TITANIC certainly has many flaws.  The framing story is sometimes mishandled, making the first half hour drag.  The humorous wisecracks, while funny, are often very poorly timed and undercut the drama of the scenes. Since Cameron has to tell his story during the brief duration of the TITANIC's voyage, Rose's transformation from inhibited prisoner of class expectations to free and independent woman is too hasty.  Cameron also at times seems intent on demonizing the rich just for being rich, a tad hypocritical for a man who risked and made millions on this movie.  And the dialogue has more than its share of melodramatic lines and the odd cliche, though Winslet and DiCaprio deliver it so well that I generally didn't mind.Still, there is great power in Cameron's invitation to become attached to something you know is doomed.  Some refuse to take the risk, but not wisely; everything that you become attached to is doomed, sooner or later.

388,ups-36964,Exceptional and Heartwarming Classic,10,23 November 2018,"Titanic is one of my favourite. Definitely not because of Jack and Rose's boring romance and blah blah blah.But due to the emotional and disastrous effect it made. It could be even better if the romance sequences were cut short.Nevertheless, its one of those classic movies not to be missed.",Titanic
389,joncheskin,Strangely Universal,9,28 March 2020,"Watched this movie for a second time recently with my 17-year-old son. He actually suggested the viewing, he heard about the movie and was curious. Rarely have I had a better entertainment experience with a family member.Titanic is just simply awesome, a movie that you just sit back and marvel at. Photography, special effects, costumes, production are just incredible, with a real feel of authentic time travel back to 1912. Musical score also sweeping and emotional, of course with Celine Dion's favorite song and a wonderful orchestral sweep.A little more controversial is the screenplay and love story, which some commentators have portrayed as trite and even amateurish. What saves this movie, and in fact turns it into an instant classic, is that the characters are much more universal than they appear at first glance, and really have a great chemistry. Leonardo Di Caprio's Jack is an underdog orphan that has suffered great personal hardship, Kate Winslet's Rose is a young woman of great spirit completely stifled by her family and her society. You really can't help but root for them, and the chemistry between the two is absolutely fantastic. Put this story in the midst of one of the great human tragedies of the 20th century, and at the very least you have a very potent formula, even if it is not executed perfectly at every turn. Often my son and I were laughing at some of the cliches in the midst of being completely absorbed in the unfolding drama.If you love movies, you will love Titanic, it is that simple. It is an emotional, gorgeous, romantic, sexy, awesome spectacle of a movie.",Titanic
390,cinemel,The epic tale of Titanic still is grand now on DVD,9,1 September 1999,"James Cameron's record-breaking epic `Titanic' yesterday sailed into stores in the first DVD edition. Paramount has done an outstanding job of bringing the pictorial and auditory splendor of this film to its latest video incarnation. Watching this story unfold after about a year reminds one of what a cinematic masterpiece it is. Cameron has used many of the tried and true movie conventions to great effect.  Slow motion enhances the lovers' flight through the engine rooms, using the glow of the furnaces to foreshadow the romantic scene to come and the ensuing tragic events.  Instead of constantly bombarding the viewer with a blaring soundtrack, in the sequence just before the ship finally sinks, the director uses the spare violins playing  `Near My God to Thee' as the Captain, the architect and other characters near their approaching doom. The sound design also includes some extremely effective use of surround sound as Rose (Kate Winslet) searches the bowels of the ship for Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio). The creaks of the near-collapsing hull of the ship envelop the viewer as does the sometimes soaring and sometimes-quiet musical score of composer, James Newton Howard.Performances are impassioned all around. Kathy Bates is both humorous as she dresses DiCaprio and touching as she observes the foundering ship in its final moments. Francis Fisher portrays Rose's selfish mother in such a way that even though she is selfish and bigoted, you somehow understand her. When she laces up Roses corset and explains her reasons for desiring a marriage for wealth rather than love, she holds a mirror up to the society of class distinctions that would be disappearing with the sinking of the ship. Eric Braeden has too few scenes as John Jacob Astor. However, he is perfect in projecting that image of new American wealth and class. Surely many of his scenes ended up on the cutting room floor. (In the excellent CD-ROM, `James Cameron's Titanic Explorer', Astor searches frantically for his dog as the sea engulfs the ship.) Victor Garber is most sympathetic as Titanic's architect. His final moments setting a clock as he awaits the inevitable is memorable. Bernard Hill is the Titanic's Captain Smith. Hill imbues this oft portrayed character with a subtlety so you sense his frustration as he realizes that his hands are tied as the ship sinks from under him. In a  scene with a steerage class mother who asks him where she must  go to a lifeboat he just barely shrugs and turns away from her. Jonathan Hyde is the steamship line's representative and a major heavy in his insistence that the ship break speed records and his quiet slinking on to a lifeboat to save his own neck. Incidentally, he lived the rest of his life in shame and seclusion. Of course, the tale is carried along by the expert thesping of DiCaprio and Winslet as the star-crossed lovers. Their travels throughout the length and breadth of the magnificent expanse of ocean liner give the viewer a perfect sense of the luxury and size of Titanic. Although their characters are fictional they bring them gloriously to life, so that in the end one really cares whether they live or die.One hopes that Cameron will, in the future, release a Collector's Deluxe edition including deleted scenes and a detailed `making of' feature giving the digital effects crew a chance to show how some of the fantastic special effects made everything seem so real. What made the effects so special is that they were unnoticeable. Cameron has made a film for the ages. It has earned all of the many awards it has won. Its place as a classic will only be realized with the passage of time. However, its records as the most popular American film to date will probably not be broken for many years to come.",Titanic
391,jimmyplm,Highly Over Rated,1,26 February 1999,"The fact that this movie won an Oscar for Best Film is one of the biggest disgraces of all time (it ranks right up there with Madonna not getting nominated for her role in Evita).

392,starlit-sky,"Classic Titanic tale flavored with romance, superbly directed",8,3 September 2010,"We all know the story of Titanic. Telling it through the eyes of ordinary characters would be dull. James Cameron smartly decided to make this a movie about romance between two lovers Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). I think the strong romance actually works and makes the audience care more about what happens to them, and of course, to the ship. This is a very sad story - as you might guess. The scenes after the ship hits the iceberg and everything goes haywire are shot with cinematic excellence. I believe this movie still remains to be the highest grossing films of all time and most number of Oscars earned. The only thing that bothers me every time Kate and Leonardo co-star in a movie, it is always Kate that gets nominated and Leonardo is always passed. I hope his day will come soon.",Titanic
393,Mario64,A very good movie,9,27 March 1999,"As a teenage guy it may seem weird to hear that Titanic was a very good movie from my mouth, but it is. Leonardo DiCaprio was very believable in this movie and to a lesser extent so was Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart. This movie was very well created with excellent art-direction and cenematography. The sinking of the ship in this movie is so good, that when I saw it in the theaters I almost felt that I was in the middle of the Atlantic on a huge sinking ship. This movie wasn't the best movie of 1997, LA Confidential was that. Still Titanic may be the best combination of very good acting and great special effects I've ever seen. **** out of **** for Titanic.",Titanic
394,teejayniles2345,"""Inspired"" by historical events but not constrained",9,30 June 2001,"This blockbuster is a milestone in film making and a career peak for Director/Producer James Cameron.  When this film bowled over the competition (except in acting and writing categories) at the Academy Awards,  it could be the occasion of a gleeful self-coronation (Mr. Cameron as ""King of the World"").  It had set box office records and was probably also record-breaking for multiple ticket purchases by teen fans of such a long epic.  Like its ""older sister"" GONE WITH THE WIND, this Best Picture Oscar-winner exists in a self-enclosed quasi-historical environment where the beautiful survive and thrive despite morally despicable transgressions. It claims to be ""inspired"" by actual events around the sinking and recent re-discovery at ocean's bottom. Those who love TITANIC feel that the mismatched couple outdo ""Romeo & Juliet"" as a most appealing ""eternal"" couple.  Teen fans of Leonardo DiCaprio would gladly throw caution to the wind as did the lead actress who poses nude quite immodestly.  As an unimpressed but still positive-minded fan of this movie overall, however, I have loads of questions to ask those who defend this as ""one of the all-time best movies"" (A.F.I. put it in the category of MOST THRILLING in its 2001 list recently).  For example, shouldn't a more specific disclaimer be attached to the closing credit acknowledgments about the ship's crew and captain who are ""transformed"" unnecessarily and untruthfully into brutish villains? Since real names of actual dead are attached to some ""inspired"" crew and passengers, attentive audience members assume that those historical people who deserve blame (like Bruce Ismay) are those who did kill and threaten others and otherwise act like the most wicked people ever.  Too many names can be exonerated and should be since this script took liberties with depicting the desperate, final actions of the crew.  As a second example, why doesn't Molly Brown get her lifeboat over to help those floating in life-jackets (in regular history, this IS (!) part of her claim to fame)?  Furthermore, what happened to Fabrizio in the film's middle?  How is it that the 100+ year-old is unsupervised at film's end?  Does the special effects wizardry paper over and rationalize the simplistic ""chase"" elements of the film's quite long middle?  I felt a bit confused whether the drowned victims were mostly ""caged in"" by the class-bigots among the fictional crew ""stewards"" or if they were just too slow in figuring out a strategy like the romantic couple had as the Titanic goes down for the third time.  Any help on these issues, Mr. Cameron and defenders of his script?  I didn't expect to know if time ""stood still"" when the ship takes on water but the film takes the ""worst spin"" on how the lifeboats get loaded and away in time to save only 1/3 of those aboard.  Were these numbers strictly correct? The facts could have been a little better adhered to, in my opinion. Again, this is an amazing entertainment product and a Hollywood legend's masterpiece.",Titanic
395,ericjg623,"Not great, but good",7,17 December 2001,"I just finished watching this on TV. It's easy to see why this movie was initially overhyped and overrated, then trashed as nothing more than a pre-teen chick flick. In truth, it's a lot like ""Dances with Wolves"", a big screen three hour plus epic that grabbed a fistful of Oscars, then p***ed everyone off by beating out what many thought was a superior film (for ""Titanic"" it was ""LA Confidential"", for ""Wolves"" it was ""Goodfellas""). I don't know if it was Oscar material, but it was definitely better than the critics now claim. On the plus side, no expense was spared in getting every detail visually perfect. I don't know how he did it, but James Cameron managed to thoroughly convince his audience that it was the real Titanic we were seeing. And the sinking scenes were amazingly real, enough to grab the heart of the most jaded movie goer. On the minus side, far too much time was spent on the fictional romance between Jack and Rose. The story of the Titanic itself contains so much drama that wasting two hours on this love affair was simply not needed. In short, this could have been THE film of the 1990's, instead it ended up as a good, but not great, money-making blockbuster.",Titanic
396,benbrae76,"""Love in a cold climate""?,",4,11 September 2006,"Such a lot of care was taken, so I'm told, with most aspects of the accuracy of this movie. If that is so, I cannot understand why one of the most important facts is glaringly wrong, and that is the name of the ship. It was not the SS Titanic, but the RMS Titanic, i.e. The Royal Mail Ship Titanic.I could be wrong, but I think it must be taken with a pinch of salt that the sketch left in the safe could have really been in such pristine condition after 80 years at the bottom of the Atlantic, protected or no. It was an excellent movie in regard to the computer imagery, and a marvellous treat for those unfortunates who wallow in disaster for their entertainment. I'm not one of them, and only really watched it out of curiosity after all the hype. I couldn't see what all the fuss was about, and for me even the a pitiful sub-plot couldn't save it. It's not a patch on ""A Night to Remember"" and that was in black and white with no computerised aids. One last comment; I can well understand an upper class girl falling for a working class bit of rough, even in the second decade of the 20th century. What puzzles me is how they managed to enjoy love-making in Arctic conditions, and in the back seat of a freezing car. Brrr! It doesn't bear thinking about.",Titanic
397,eddiez61,A Gargantuan Disappointment,6,29 May 2009,"Titanic sinks itself on technical, artistic and ethical reasons. Firstly, the script is horribly corny and tedious. Everyone speaks as though they're one day out of acting school, over-emoting even the simplest, most minor of thoughts. I never felt anything genuinely warm or tender between the two stars. For a 3+ hour movie, there's ridiculously little time spent on character development. And the shallow clichéd narration of the old lady gets extremely tedious.Secondly, the effects do not hold up today, in 2011. You might say that's an unfair criticism, to hold a 14 year old movie up to modern technical standards. The effects, it turns out, are the only part I originally liked back in 1997. At that time I would have given the movie a 6 or 7 just for the visual spectacle. It now looks dated and awkward, and it's just not enough to justify any effort to watch it today. Finally, and most importantly, the story just falls down by not playing up the doubts and fears that many people had at the time of the ship's construction. There were experts in maritime engineering that forewarned of such a possible catastrophe, but neither the owners nor the public were concerned. The notion of being able to safely maneuver such a Leviathan was loudly challenged by nautical men, but the Great Ship is presented as an unquestionably positive, glorious achievement. The film conveys that it was entirely the fault of chance—an act of nature, a freak accident, a stray iceberg—that downed the ship, and not ignorance, pride, hubris. As it is I was waiting eagerly for it's inevitable demise, I almost felt everyone deserved it. James Cameron should have gone down with his tremendous, beautiful beast.And it certainly is beautiful. We are treated to near pornographic views of gleaming stacks, sumptuous accommodations, and throbbing mechanical drives. The best of society are so eager to participate in this obscene orgy of excess, but Mr. Cameron wants me to feel sympathetic with these self important gluttons. OK, so Leonardo and Kate are ""different"", but still they are deluded. Their only crime, perhaps, is their youth, so yes, their story is a tragedy. Their standing on the bow of the mighty ship is an iconic image that's truly impressive, but there's no underlying sense of conscience to give it high contrast. It comes off as just a shallow, slick promotional ad for the cruise line. My point is that I feel it's so sad to see how seemingly convinced people were that technological marvels were proof of man's superiority and divine place on Earth. We now know that such absurdly over-sized endeavors truly only serve a very few at the great expense of very many. And it's happening today right now at an at even more frantic pace. We are doomed if we stay the course, but ""Titanic"" celebrates the choice to not reconsider our way. By intentionally creating such a tremendous sensation in our culture this movie, Mr. Cameron, and every one involved in some way took on a responsibility to reward our attention with something worthwhile and substantial. It does not. It purposely avoids any such responsibility or awareness. It is pure escapist fantasy of the highest order that defies it's viewers to question any of it's splendor. I find this insulting to be expected not to think for myself. That's just so depressing, and so tragic in ways which James Cameron is apparently oblivious. I feel that this film is just too much fluff and glitter, not worthy of it's efforts and costs. We are supposed to be smarter today about not living for such trivial wasteful excess. It's exactly this kind of consumption that is accelerating our ecological decline and inflicting extreme hardships on so many millions of disadvantaged people the world over. That's a very big heavy thought, for sure, but this massive movie is just asking for — demanding — this kind of consideration. Titanic omits the most important compelling bit of the story. The old lady's love may live on, but her planet is sinking...",Titanic

400,Calysta,Did I use to like that movie?,5,19 January 2000,"It was the most amazing movie two years ago, but in 2000, the flawed fiction account of the most famous ship in history seems overstatingly unbelievable. Attempting to be faithful to fact while making Leonardo look overwhelmingly good to drag girls around my target age group to the box office now makes me embarrassed to be once part of the phenomenon that once was. Unfortunately, fact could not combine with romance on that one with a director who seemed more intent of running bills into the millions of dollars to break into the record books.I will not be entirely venomous towards the movie, because it was after all, at one stage, my favourite movie. Kate Winslet's performance was perhaps the best in the whole film, but her lower key and lower profiled Oscar nominated performance in ""Sense and Sensibility"" as Marianne still exceeds this one entirely. She has a knack for costume period drama in a good showy part, but she has done better work elsewhere.What once seemed to be perfection of movie making is quickly becoming evident with its misconceptions of film making. The screenplay at the time, and the musical score seemed completely breathtaking, but now merely looks the complete fluke that had enough star drawing power to get people to hand over their cash to the box office. Celine Dion assaulting the world with a maudlin ballad about a sinking ship of course increased the movie's success to a greater extent than it deserved. Perhaps the art decoration, costume design and cinematography will outlast some of the mediocre elements disguised beneath the surface of the gloss. The ""Titanic"" hype lasted long enough to secure a record equaling amount of Oscars first reached in 1959 with ""Ben-Hur"". During the 1990s, the Academy seemed to be handing the best picture statuette to the wrong pictures, with the exception of ""Schlindler's List"" and ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Without a doubt, it will retain its place in history as a movie epic for all the generations. But it is certainly no ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""Casablanca"", and in sixty years we'll be wondering what we were thinking.

406,gerry-russell-139,A great film but not the film of the '90s,7,8 November 1999,"""Titanic"" is one great film that never falters in length, talent or action but is not ever to be considered THE #1 film of the '90s. It may come as ONLY a close second behind ""Schindler's List"". Kate Winslet is a promising character actress but Leo DiCaprio is destined to play only contemporary parts well. His take on Romeo in ""William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet"" (1996) was very 90s despite the faithfulness to Will's original script and Jack in ""Titanic"" was very much the same. ""The Man in the Iron Mask"" was pretty much of a flop on his part also. Billy Zane, after playing dozens of supporting parts now has a chance of proving himself a good leading man (such as shown in tv's ""Cleopatra"" as Mark Antony last May). Gloria Stewart made a tremendous comeback after 45+ years with her portrayal of Old Rose but millions were shocked when she didn't win the Supporting Actress Oscar. Who did it go to? Miss Kim Basinger! Notorious for playing a prostitute in every movie she's made. Kathy Bates is a perfect choice to play the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown and Frances Fisher is a narrow-minded wretch of a woman as Rose's mother Ruth, one who only cared about herself and her position in society. Now for sheer spectacle and brilliant music, action and tension, ""Titanic"" may qualify as the best ACTION movie of the decade but not on a general ""all-in-all"" scale as a unique drama. ""Ben-Hur"" (1959) finally met it's match as the Oscar-winning champ when ""Titanic"" tied with it as the film with the highest number of Oscars (11 in all for both). And the ever-popular ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion is probably the greatest song written for a film since ""Moon River"" of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"".

407,byrann_gowan,A legendary film,8,11 July 2012,"This film is one of only a select few that has had the privilege of winning 11 Academy Awards, and with good reason. It is clearly one of the best films of all time. I got the privilege of seeing it earlier this year in 3D. I had already seen it before, but my parents said that it was quite the experience seeing it in theatres. They could not be more correct on that.The story is that Rose, an upper-class citizen, is engaged to a wealthy man named Cal. However, she feels trapped in her world, and she is almost pushed over the ledge when she meets Jack, a lower-class citizen. Despite their difference in social status, they take a liking to each other, despite Cal's and her mother's hatred of Jack. Despite their social status and everybody against their pairing, the two fall deeply in love, when suddenly... well, if you know the story of the RMS Titanic, then you know the rest of this story.James Cameron, you are a master filmmaker. You've done it with the Terminator movies, Aliens, True Lies, The Abyss, and you have also done it with Titanic, as well as Avatar, which is my favourite movie of all time. What Cameron is great at doing is creating a story in which the first part tells the story without all the crazy stuff happening, so that when the second part/final action scenes come, we know who to cheer for when something good happens and who to cry for when something bad happens. He did it with this movie, he did it with Avatar; it is a great way of providing the audience with amazing special effects and action sequences without them being too distracting from the movie.I must also applaud the acting. Gloria Stuart is amazing in her supporting role, and she shares much of her screen time with Bill Paxton, who also does great, despite the limitations he gets in this film. Frances Fisher is great as the overbearing mother, who seems to only care about money, and not about her daughters' wishes. Kathy Bates lightens up the screen with her witty dialogue as Molly Brown, while Billy Zane is great as the antagonist, Cal.However, it is our two leads, Leo and Kate, who truly shine here. They would later go on to act in Revolutionary Road, and both films show their chemistry well. If these two became a real-life couple, I would not be surprised, as they seem to have a whole lot of chemistry on screen.Overall, this movie is a triumph. If you have not seen it, stop reading this, turn off your computer, go to the nearest DVD store, and buy it.

I've also seen Winslet do a better job, despite her Oscar nomination. James Cameron is a great special effects director, and I think some day people will look at him as one of the great influences of 1980's and 90's popular film. I enjoyed the film, although I did not LOVE it, but that's ok. The music was appropriate, if a little overdone, but the romance was great.

409,RichardKleiner,"Why it is still hated by some critics, I will never know",9,5 January 2008,"This is probably the best example of a critic's grudge against a terrific film. Yes, the love story is clichéd and unoriginal. So what? Everything else is flawless. The effort James Cameron spent with the historical accuracy is commendable at least. Not so many times we can see a film set in a certain time period with appropriate costumes, set designs, silverware, etc. Even the actors were cast to be almost identical to their real life counterparts. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find the dialog bad at all. There are no lines passing for catch phrases, like in other big budget movies. The visual effects, I'm speechless just to think about them. Even the love story, cheesy as it is, was greatly written, like in the old days. The acting was great, almost obliged to be great. The characters were amazingly portrayed, and Cameron made sure every single death would ache your heart (except for Lovejoy), something nobody really can do nowadays. Of course, there is the nude scene with Kate Winslet, something for all those pre-teens out there, and the little sex scene inside the coach. Aside of building up the romance between Rose and Jack, both scenes prove to be a little pointless. Even though, James Cameron is who actually draws the Rose picture, so that really gives more of an artistic merit. Music, well, it's good, and I don't mean just that song you all know. James Horner's score is actually very good, part of his list of great works.One critic spotted several technical errors in the movie, one of them being the sun's position during the ""I'm flying!"" sequence at the wrong side. But hey! If you want to find the bad stuff, you'll find it. That's not what film-making is about. You don't go to the theater to shred to pieces any single movie you see (we got MST3K for that). Titanic is one of those few movies that is timeless to this day. I can only compare it to Casablanca, or more specially to Gone With the Wind. It's larger than life, it's long as hell, but it's enjoyable every single time you see it (I forgot how many times I've seen it on TV alone).",Titanic

The performances are, by and large, good-to-excellent, except for Leonardo DiCaprio, who did much better in his earlier movies (up to and including The Quick and the Dead), and Billy Zane, who's never been able to do more than look like a movie star.Cameron is a great director of action, and a good visual story teller.  Too bad he's such a control freak, he ought to allow someone to re-write all his dialogue so that it sounds like humans talking, not T-1000's.

The b-story of Jack and Rose's romance is touching and never dull, the historical facts are generally accurate, except for a few minor errors. But a lot of people forget this film is told from the point of view of a 101-year-old woman! I rarely find myself choking up watching a film, but this show did it to me -- the only other movie ever to make me cry is the excellent Hawks (1989). Repeated viewings of Titanic only make the experience better, because you get to see different things each time. By the way, anyone staying away from Titanic because of Celine Dion will be happy to note her song doesn't appear until the closing credits ...  the rest of the time James Horner's exquisite work carries the film.",Titanic
412,xsophietaylorx,my favourite film,10,7 October 2014,"Titanic is my favourite film off all time. I can watch this film night after night and never get bored of it. Every time I watch it I feel like I experience a range off different emotions to the previous time watching it. Titanic is just such a beautiful thing it really does win the heart of the audience, the film makes you cry and laugh it is a tale of history and romance. Leonardo Dicaprio plays Jack Dawson a character you can't help but fall in love with. This is one of James Cameron's brilliant pieces of work. I would recommend this film to anyone, It is beyond me how people can say they don't like this film I mean what is not to like?",Titanic
413,MadReviewer,"Overrated? Slightly, But Not By Much",7,15 May 2001,"`Titanic' has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made, and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but puerile, overrated garbage.  The truth lies somewhere in between - `Titanic' definitely shouldn't have won the Best Picture Oscar in 1997 (), but to dismiss the film as utter crap is very unfair.  `Titanic' tells a complex tale, and, for the most part, tells it very well.  The fact that parts of this tale are either predictable or flawed shouldn't be ignored, but it also isn't enough to turn `Titanic' into a rotten movie. `Titanic' has a slightly predictable story, but most films involving a well-known historical event tend to be predictable.  Before the movie even starts, anybody watching `Titanic' should be able to predict a few things: The Titanic will set sail in glorious fashion, with its owners grandly proclaiming its unsinkable nature; there will be a story about the passengers, some fictional, some real; the Titanic will sink in a slow and horrible fashion; and while the ship sinks, the characters will be forced to deal with their own mortality, and some will be heroes while others will be craven cowards.  See?  Predictable.  It doesn't take a genius to realize that the historical nature of `Titanic' dictates this story structure. After all, it's the structure James Cameron actually uses.  But the execution of that structure . . . well, that takes some talent, if the film has any aspirations of being good.  It means blending action, romance, drama, and historical accuracy.  And James Cameron blends them all splendidly.The main story concerns a young girl named Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), traveling to America in order marry an arrogant millionaire named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane).  The marriage, which has been arranged by her formerly rich and now-destitute mother (Frances Fisher), is abhorrent to Rose, so in a desperate attempt to escape her fate, she attempts to jump off the ship.  Of course, she doesn't jump, but is instead saved by the happy-go-lucky Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), and of course the two begin a brief, if implausible, romance.  This romance, which is perhaps the weakest part of `Titanic' is still vitally important to the story . . . because it gives the audience a very strong reason to care about these characters when the ship hits the iceberg, and about the choices they make. Could it have been better?  Absolutely.  But considering that the romance is a means to an end, rather than the end itself, it's not bad.DiCaprio is superb as the wide-eyed vagabond Jack Dawson - he brings enough earnest enthusiasm to the role to make it totally believable as to why Rose would fall in love so quickly with him.  Winslet's slightly less believable, though; she's good, but not great.  She puts in a nice, quiet, restrained performance, but it's so restrained at times that it borders on comatose. It's actually the minor characters that add some zip to `Titanic' - Billy Zane is outstanding as the villain Hockley, as he gives Hockley enough human nuances to make him seem like a flawed, arrogant person, and not just some standard bad guy ripped straight out of a Flash Gordon serial.  Also worthy of note is the modern-day interaction between deep-sea explorer Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) and the elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), floating on an exploration ship far above the watery grave of the Titanic.  No only does their interaction serve as a brilliant, unobtrusive way of relaying the historical facts about the Titanic's final hours to the audience, but Paxton also manages to become a surrogate for the audience - as the movie unfolds and gets more and more interesting, it's a neat touch to see his character Lovett become more and more fascinated with Rose's stories.It would be remiss not to mention the special effects of `Titanic', which by and large is the film's strength. While the ship (and its sinking) is a product of CGI effects and model works, it's done it such a realistic manner that it never calls attention to itself, or reminds the audience that they're watching a movie. Of more importance is that the film's effects, while spectacular, never ARE the film - they always SUPPORT the film's story.There are many things to nit-pick about `Titanic' (although I find it hard to believe that people really nit-pick the minor historical inaccuracies of the film; Cameron got all the major details right, and the films probably more than 95% accurate, for crying out loud).  But those problems are nit-picks - very tiny but slightly irritating details, nothing more.  They keep the film from being an all-time great, but they certainly don't make it a bad film.  The blend of romance, action, history, and special effects probably explains the film's vast appeal - there's certainly something for everyone in this film - and it also makes `Titanic' an excellent, if not perfect, movie.  Grade: B+",Titanic
414,tracywinters-44332,"Very grand, very entertaining, and very frightening",9,29 November 2017,"I don't understand all the bad reviews here. I'm not given to getting syrupy over romance films, but this one actually was pretty good.A telling of the true story of the sinking of the ship Titanic, but this movie is first and foremost a romance movie. Kate Winslet is beautiful, and though they could have cast a better male lead, Leo DiCaprio is not too bad.The real star of this film is the sinking ship sequence. It is quite realistic and the cold weather and fright of that night back in 1912 is at least partly captured --- it must have been a terrible event for the poor souls on board that vessel. The moment that was most poignant to me was when Captain Smith went back to his bridge and realized the ocean was about to break through his giant windows.Recommended for all who love a good romance film.",Titanic
415,ToldYaSo,The most undeserving of praise in the history of film,1,9 May 1999,"What I think I'll probably like best about the new Star Wars film, ""Phantom Menace"", is that it will likely blow ""Titanic"" out of the water, if you'll pardon the pun, when it comes to sheer devastating box office receipts, and thereby knock it out of the number one spot. Every time I hear someone declare ""Titanic"" is the greatest film they've ever seen, I think to myself, ""You don't see a lot of movies, do you?"" What a travesty. You could make 50 good films that are a lot better than ""Titanic"", and for the same price tag.""Well, it won lots of academy awards, lots of people really loved it,"" as someone might say in its defence. Well, lots of people like the Spice Girls and billions and billions of people eat at McDonald's, but that doesn't mean it's high quality. Yes, millions of Elvis fans CAN be wrong.I'll be the first to admit, that part of the problem for me was the mega-hype over the film. I waited a month or so to see it and ultimately, it didn't live up to the expectations set upon it, which simply called more attention to the appallingly stupid love story. It's true, ""Phantom Menace"" will likely suffer a similar fate. but.James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is. a)  a cheesy action flick thinly disguised as a serious period piece. b)  a three-hour epic that has it's finest moments given away in the trailer. c)  a sappy love story beyond belief or entertainment. d)  something left better to documentarians, which I would've enjoyed much more. e)  a film with arrogance that lives up to the level demonstrated with the real ship. f)  a  robbery of 3 hours that I will never get back, therefore the greatest motivation for a time machine I can think of. When I meet someone who hasn't seen it yet, I say, ""I wish I could trade places with you."" g)  a slap in the face to any genuine victim of hypothermia. How long are we supposed to believe that people can be immersed in freezing cold water and still form intelligible sentences? h)  thankfully a film that wasn't recognized for any acting achievements at the Oscars. i)  a technological achievement in filmmaking, and little else.The only reason I post this as a anonymous comment is I do NOT welcome the rebuttal of 10,000 thirteen year old Leonardo DiCaprio fans who'll no doubt come to his defense, and I am not really interested in hearing a defense of Titanic's story, acting or length.",Titanic
416,ichabod81,Very good film. *minor spoilers*,10,12 May 2003,"Titanic is a beautiful and thoughtful movie. One thing bothers me.. the overly dramatic dialogue between Jack and Rose. It's sooo disgusting at times. Why can't they talk like normal people? Rose: ""Oh Jack, (insert melodramatic line)"". Jack: Oh Rose, (insert melodramatic response)"". Other that that, I have very little bad to say about this. Cameron builds the tension between the characters and the ship beautifully and by the time Titanic's doom is approaching faster and faster, the film turns into a very ""beautiful"" survival story. The part when the ship breaks in two is especially dramatic. One more thing, Cameron is known for his larger that life action movies, and it is obvious that this time around he's tried something else. But let's be honest.. the last hour on the Titanic is just one brilliant action scene. It's just in his nature, why fight it?***** / *****",Titanic
417,MovieDude1893,Only to be Idolized by Starry Eyed Tweens,5,25 July 2007,"Titanic {dir. James Cameron, 1997} (*½/****)Somewhere on its way to becoming the all time box office champion and biggest Oscar winner of all time, James Cameron's Titanic etched out a place in my mind as the one film that can most easily send me into a frenzied rant against the dangers of big- budget, epic film making. Sure, I might not have put it that way when I first saw it (I was seven) but, upon first viewing I knew that this film was nothing special. Four years later, I was able to identify it as simply money thrown onto the screen with little room left for intelligence, emotion or character. Yet even as I professed the evils of this production and its vapid screenplay (penned by director Cameron), there were those who maintained that Titanic was an achievement. Among those people are esteemed film critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert , both of whom included it on their top ten lists of 1997. Those celebratory citations led me to revisit Titanic again recently, for the first time on DVD, a disc which preserves the film's original aspect ratio and presents the clearest available picture and sound. The Verdict: As the old truism goes, ""You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig.""The film isn't all bad; the cast is solid (considering the material..but more on that later), the score is rich, the cinematography is evocative and the production design and visual effects are impeccable. Yet as it turns out, all these elements do not a great film make. Titanic's greatest weakness lies at its very core: the screenplay. It reaches a level so wretched that I will be blunt in my metaphoric criticism. Cameron's script isn't just a turd, it is a floater; it refuses to just be flushed away to haunt us no longer. It insists on having an epic length and employing a framing device that may very well be the cause of a sudden onset of narcolepsy. I'm sorry to resort to such infantile comparison, but I believe that is best to convey the utter insult that is Cameron's screenplay. I consider myself a romantic, yet the so-called romance of this film left me cold, with nothing to do except roll my eyes. The film lacks any new vision or originality, and that can never be commended. I'm fed up at this point; three viewing, each one revealing an un-plundered area of Cameron's incompetence. This film remains an interminable, and wildly popular, mash of tired formula only be idolized by starry eyed tweens.",Titanic

I am not saying this in a negative way because sometimes you just need a sappy movie to take to bed. Not everything has to be Shakespeare to be enjoyable. So get some chocolate ice cream and a glass of red wine and don't think for an evening. Trust me, it will be fun.",Titanic
419,kira02bit,A modern old-fashioned classic,9,29 November 2006,"This film shares a lot of parallels with the legendary Gone With the Wind. It is a romantic spectacle set against the backdrop of historical events and became both a huge Oscar-winning success and the surprise box office behemoth of its era. Another similarity it shares with the former is that following the success it is now considered ""hip"" to be derogatory and dismiss it as a Hollywood film. It is a Hollywood film, but not in the insulting manner that detractors would indicate. It is a sublime demonstration of what can happen when a visionary director puts his reputation on the line and uses the limits of what Hollywood has to offer to bring it to the screen.The film opens in present day with a group of scientific treasure hunters exploring the remains of the sunken Titanic in an effort to locate a priceless necklace. Instead, they find a preserved portrait of a young woman. The elderly woman, Rose (Gloria Stuart), is located and brought to the site to relate her story of the last days of the Titanic and the film unfolds. It is a familiar romantic tale with rich-in-name-only Rose (now played by Kate Winslet) betrothed against her will to a boorish millionaire. In a fit of pique, she contemplates suicide and is talked out of it by charming penniless artist Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). During the remainder of the ill-fated voyage, they fall in love and incur the wrath of her fiancé and her mother, until the fateful iceberg and destiny in the icy waters of the North Atlantic intervene.There are so many ways that the film could have gone wrong, but director James Cameron wisely sidesteps them. Much of the fuel used by the detractors of the film would have turned it into an infinitely weaker production. Evidence of Cameron's sure narrative hand can be found in numerous spots. Starting the film with the treasure hunters provides for a brilliant moment which allows them to recreate on a computer the death throes of the Titanic so that when the final 90 minutes begin the viewer is completely aware of why certain things are occurring as they do. It also offers a wonderful opportunity for 1930s film star Gloria Stuart to show her acting chops as the latter day Rose.Cameron also gives us a strong scope of the immensity of the great ship herself, as well as the class differentiation in the status of the clientele traveling therein. Much has been made of centering the film on the two characters of Jack and Rose, while having the remainder of the cast play support rather than spread the wealth around more. One could and has done that: it is called The Poseidon Adventure. The reason why this film works on so many levels is because it is far more than the standard disaster epic. The fact that the action is basically consolidated through the eyes of young lovers streamlines the film and keeps the action focused, and Cameron comes up with increasingly inventive ways to move them through different parts of the ship to cover as much action as possible. The fact that they are young lovers experiencing their first romance provides a vitality and sense of urgency that may have been missing from older protagonists. Many have sneered over much the ""Jack"" ""Rose"" ""Jack"" dialog interaction in the climactic moments as a lack of good writing, but given that we are talking about teenage lovers in serious peril, one wonders if people expected them to quote intellectual diatribes back and forth. Instead, what comes from their mouths is far more likely and believable, if repetitive. Further, look at how often Cameron takes the narrative high road. When Jack is invited by the rich people to join them for dinner for saving Rose early in the film, he could have punctured the egos of the rich and wowed Rose with his coarseness. Instead, he behaves in a totally mature fashion and ends up charming the majority of those at their table. The film is brimming with memorable sequences, including the highly sensual moment when Rose invites Jack to draw her portrait or the (much parodied) scene of the two lovers embracing at the front of the ship as it skims the water. For detractors that claim that the special effects involving the sinking of the Titanic save the film, it makes their argument untenable when so many audiences have already been won over long before the sinking begins. The climactic moments are intense, heart-breaking and unforgettable.The majority of the film's success (aside from Cameron) must be attributed to the leads. I would never have previously cast them as a couple, but DiCaprio and Winslet have chemistry. Not just any chemistry, but the chemistry of which cinematic legends are made. Winslet provides a warm, sympathetic and resonant presence throughout the film portraying a character that proves much stronger than even she initially believes. She draws you into the action and her final moments rank as some of her best acting. Conversely, although I admit DiCaprio is a good actor, I am not usually much of a fan. Here, I cannot see anyone else in this role. It is a distinct departure from anything else that he has attempted and he has no acting ""hook"" on which to hinge his work. Playing a larger-than-life character that clicks with the audience is one of the trickiest obstacles, but when Rose declares that ""he saved me in every way that a person can be saved"" DiCaprio makes you believe it. The fact that he makes it appear so effortless probably resulted in his Oscar nomination snub, but the truth is that he is definitely the worthy Gable to Winslet's Leigh.",Titanic

Score is just perfect icing of the cake (My heart will go on!). But Rose (who looks like that gorgeous flower, but only superficially) is one of those strong, feisty heroines who are actually spoiled, whiny and unsympathetic, attacking the male servants because, ya know, 1st class female passenger is a victim and the male servant an evil patriarch.

421,bulleetz37235,A huge disaster.,1,1 September 2005,"There is more wrong with this film than anyone could possibly say. I honestly don't know where to begin. Romance is bad. Reasons.1)I am not the most knowledgeable person when it comes to romance, but isn't there more to it than nude portraits and life saving? Also where is the attraction to a guy that looks like a woman? Yes Leonardo DiCrapio acts a little effeminately to be loved as Jack Dawson our so-called hero, or at least I think that is what everyone thought he was, he isn't at all, and you know why? It is simply because that if Rose Dawson (played badly by Kate Winslet, I'll explain later) hadn't known him she would have gone home happily without losing anyone close to her, and she wouldn't have jumped, no way would she, and if she had at least the film would have been over quicker, and also he is totally repulsive, especially to the male half of the audience, I mean really who is this film for?2) Attraction. I don't know how each character was attracted to each other. How can Jack be attracted to Rose when she is spitting over the side of the ship? That's disgusting even for me, never mind an effeminate person like him. Also if it's true love why didn't Rose make more room on the floating door, which she could've done easily. He might have lived if she had, heck even Jim Carrey spotted that in the film Bruce Almighty. Acting? Reasons why it is also crap.1) Winslet acts like a snob for the first part and then like a tramp, would anybody demote themselves like this? When the kid drowned in the corridor, and when she fell off the side of the boat she hardly screamed. Why? Some say she was strong. peh... Almost everyone would have screamed in those situations. I have no idea what her face expression and posture was meant to say when Leo was arrested for possessing the planted diamond, I think she was upset, maybe angry, maybe about ready to laugh? I do not know, she had NO EXPRESSION.2) Leo was the same, NO EXPRESSION. Cameron directed people to act like gormless puppets, one face for every situation. Totally unrealistic. 3) Rose's family of snobs were stereotypical, I don't like the stereotype at all. Snobs are not just money-grabbers, I am not particularly rich, but I'd like to be. With the way that each stereotype acted, it seemed that the poor wanted to stay poor, and the rich wanted to be richer. I don't think people really act like this. The directing is bad. Reasons.1) James Cameron couldn't direct traffic. His style is crap, and revolves around two kind of people a) People who have one prime desire, and nothing else, and this doesn't remotely resemble reality at all - b) The other group are people who have one stereotyped personality. These are mainly Snobs, the poor and the ship staff. James Cameron should have worked to establish more realism within his characters, only Kathy Bates can be praised for achieving this.2) The special effects are too lavish. The boat is too glammed up, and anyone who says the boat looks ""real"" is a total moron. A film needs to be more than special effects. He could have worked a little harder on the acting instead.3) Cameron's camera shots were mediocre to say the least. A few shots that were particularly bad include. The one where he shows us the whole ship from far out, I do not know what he was trying to achieve, my guess is that he was trying to show us how isolated the ship was, but this is pointless as we already knew it was isolated, you can't get more isolated in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Another example of camera shots is to do with the exchange of angles. He too often flickers back from person to person, why can't he keep the camera in one place? He may as well have pointed it at the moon, that's more interesting than a random mess of pictures. Bad plot. Reasons.It is meant to be Rose's story, and I think it should have only included her accounts. But instead it had bits that made no sense. such as.1)The two old people cuddling, getting ready to die. 2)Plates falling from shelves. 3)The captain drowning on the bridge. 4)The dome shatters and everyone inside drowns These events are shown, yet in accordance to where Rose is during the film it doesn't make sense that she should have known about these things. Why add bits? My guess is to add to the sentimentality and drama but the overall realism and straightforwardness is lost thanks to this. Boy I hate this film. Oscars? It Shouldn't have won a single solitary thing, never mind 11. There are flaws. Bigguns. No denying it really, it is totally true that almost every aspect could have been cleaned up considerably.I don't care what anyone says. I find it unbearable to watch this garbage. There is a lot more than this, wrong with this diabolical film, but I have a 1000 word limit. So all I can really say to conclude is that this film for me if not for you - SANK.",Titanic
422,roystephen-81252,All-time Top 10 classic,10,19 February 2016,"Before Titanic, I wasn't really a Cameron-fan. I liked his movies but I never thought of him as a genius (It was only later that I saw his brilliant remake of the French comedy La Totale! – True Lies, that is – which might have made me appreciate his talents more.) To tell the truth, I wasn't really interested in another adaptation of the tragedy of the Titanic, either. The movie was over-hyped and overpriced, so I thought I'd give it a pass, but I finally gave in to peer pressure. I left the theatre raving about the movie myself.It has remained one of my all-time favourites to this day. Titanic is a true masterpiece that combines a great real-life story with an equally heartbreaking imaginary one and has such visual grandeur and emotional depth that very few movies have managed to bring to the screen. It deserved every single Oscar it was given (save for the score, which is, frankly, a shameless and unimaginative rip-off of Enya's music) and it should have been awarded more. It is a shame that Kate Winslet's, Leonardo DiCaprio's and Gloria Stuart's stunning performances were shunned.It is very sad that since then it has become fashionable to dismiss the movie as a 'corny, boring melodrama', because it is anything but. Titanic is an impeccably written and directed, wonderfully acted and (from a technical point of view) superbly realised, timeless masterpiece. And it has one of the most beautiful lines ever written for the screen. 'A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets'.",Titanic

The movie is not very accurate, and their are a lot of historical mistakes, which really bog down the movie. The only reason I can find for watching this film is to see Kate Winslet, who is very pretty.I was upset they made a love type story based around a disaster.

424,cyberknight,The Second Worst Movie Ever,1,7 April 2005,"The first time I commented on this movie, I gave it a really harsh review. Since then, nothing has changed, but I'm going easier this time.Two titles come to mind when reviewing it: ""Natural Born Killers"" (NBK) and ""Gone with The Wind"" (GwTW). Till ""Titanic"", the worst and the second worst movies I've ever seen. NBK is by far the worst. It has an excellent director, a good writer, good to very good actors and, even so, it managed to be completely empty, with some spectacular sequences gone completely to waste in meaningless situations (like the wonderful gray-scale prison sequence). GwTW is another meaningless work, but it never had any chance, with terrible speeches, a director that didn't know what he was doing and a story that would have thrown it into oblivion if it was not settle in the American civil war (it has some ""historical value"", or so I was told).Back to ""Titanic"", the first obvious problem is the plot. At one side, there is this young lady, about to get married to a rich man, an educated pig, but still a pig. On the other side, there is that young man, handsome, good-hearted and a gifted artist. The only problem is that the young artist is poor, but, mind you, the lady is rich already! It was absolutely impossible for her to not fall in love with the artist. The only conflict possible is the jealousy of the rich man against the poor artist. Predictable, to say the least. Then, when everybody have fallen for the new happy couple, the ship sinks. I'm absolutely sure that people wouldn't have cried so much if everybody had died. The whole story is extremely predictable. Worse, it is made predictable.How did ""Titanic"" take the second place from GwTW? Well, it took a lot of cash to do that... Cameron wanted a real sized ship to be able to effectively send it to the bottom. Fine, it's not my money. Then we see the result on the big screen, and now it is our money! Since ""Indiana Jones 3"", I hadn't seen such a lousy chroma-key. When you see the passengers falling into the sea, it looks like they were filmed against a projection, like in the original ""King Solomon's Mines"" movie. That alone, I wouldn't have minded so much. Then you watch Cameron commenting on the box-office success of ""Titanic"" and his claim that it was due to his attention to details... Even if that statement was true, there is one more problem: the big things are all wrong, why care about the details?It was not easy to put the about four hours ""Gone with The Wind"" on third place, but Cameron made it possible in about three hours. He has a talent for blockbusters, it's too bad he cannot also make them good movies.",Titanic
425,lucianomarzo92,One of my all-time Favorites,7,11 September 2010,"Titanic is one of my favorite movies, and it is a timeless classic that did not receive the acclaim and respect it deserved. I know that it got Oscar nominations, and it received the hype, but its not even in the top 250 which is very disappointing, because Titanic is as least as good if not better than many of the movies in the top 250. It is unfortunate that it was unpopular among so many people. During its day it was the highest grossing film of all time. Unfortunately the success and hype of the movie have spawned vicious criticism. A lot of viewers love Titanic, but many more bash the film and dissect it for problems such as its ""lack of originality"", ""weak script"", and ""poor acting"", all of which are overly critical and not true. Maybe the script could have been a little better, but it was good enough for me. It may have been simple, but it was still well-written in my opinion. I don't know why everyone say's the acting is bad, I thought all of the cast did very well in this movie. As for the originality, its not the first love story to be told, but in my opinion it is the most believable, epic, and heart-wrenching love story to ever be depicted in a movie. The love the two characters have for each other is totally convincing.Titanic does use a historical setting to set the foundation for the movie, but so do a lot of other great movies. A lot of people say they don't like Titanic because it was too long, but I don't think the movie's length is a problem because it's so good that it's worth the 3 hour commitment. Sure, it could have been a little shorter, but I don't know that it would have been made that much of an improvement. Titanic is indeed a very lengthy film, but the movie is breath-taking because of its strong plot, gorgeous cinematography, phenomenal special effects, and superb acting. A lot of people don't like Leonardo Di Caprio in this movie. In fact, many of the people who didn't like this movie blame Di Caprio. Leonardo Di Caprio is not really respected as an actor but often dismissed as a ""pretty boy"". Leonardo Di Caprio is not the greatest actor ever, but he did a good job in this movie, and I find the attacks on his acting to be unfair. In my opinion he did his best work in this movie.Kate Winslet is perfect in Titanic. She is a very gifted actress who is part of what makes this movie so good. But she didn't do it alone: The chemistry between her character and Leonardo Di Caprio's character is so natural, that it does not seem like they acting at all. Kate Winslet plays a young woman from a rich family named Rose, and Leonardo Di Caprio plays a poor artist named Jack. The two meet on the voyage of the Titanic and fall in love. But Rose is strongly encouraged to marry a rich man named Cal Hockley. Rose's family and Cal disapprove of Jack. Throughout the movie Rose and Jack's relationship develops, much to Cal's dismay. Cal becomes the enemy of both Rose and Jack. He hires a man to capture Jack.A real ocean liner was built for the production of this movie. It is not quite as big as the real Titanic but it is close to it. The replica of the ship looks very authentic, it looks just like the real ship. Titanic may start off a little slow, but it is still very engrossing, in my opinion. The second half of the movie is unforgettable. It is tense, suspenseful, and compelling. Watching this movie makes you feel like you were really on the ship. The movie does include some characters that really were on the ship, but Jack and Rose's characters are fictitious. I'm not sure how accurate the rest of the movie is, but the reality of it all is impeccable. Titanic is a riveting movie that really draws you in to the disaster and the tragedy of that night.I would certainly recommend Titanic, to all audiences. Do not listen the hype though, and do not listen to the criticism either. Just watch the movie, and make your own opinion.

426,zactac,One of the most beautiful films ever made.,10,24 January 2010,"When you first hear about Titanic you immediately think you know whats going to happen (if haven't seen the movie yet you will) you'll think a sinking ship, a quick romance blooms, and a tragic story, well your right. But something about this is different from what you would usually see in a movie with this story.Just about everything in this movie is beautiful including the story, the music, even the tragic ending. When I first heard of Titanic I didn't really care for it at the time. When I was wondering how could this be the first movie to reach a billion dollars and stay the highest grossing movie of all time I decided to watch it and see why other people love it so much. And now I'm one of those people. For those of you that haven't seen Titanic it is a must-see film. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet make the perfect on screen couple in Titanic.This is a movie about two different class people that fall in love with each other and they are shunned for it. Rose (Kate Winslet) is a upper class woman being forced to marry a man she doesn't love while Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who makes a break getting to go to America again on Titanic. Simple really what happens next he saves her life they fall in love and something tragic happens the end. But how it comes about is really amazing the special effects and the script make such a simple story amazing.This is probably one of the most amazing, beautiful, and purely spectacular films of the 1990's. A must-see for all movie goers.",Titanic

428,tripwires,"I like ""Titanic""",9,7 November 2001,"I like Leonardo DiCaprio, I think he was excellent as Jack Dawson, and I think too that he deserved at least an Oscar nomination for his work. ""Titanic"" deserved to win Best Picture, and I really don't care what sort of flak I'd probably get for saying all that, but I like ""Titanic"". I was 12 when I saw it, and I remember clear as day being touched by it. It may be tacky, sappy, or just plain unbelievable, but ""Titanic"" is one of the more memorable movies I've seen. It's basically mindless entertainment brought to life by a group of actors who can really act (DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, etc). It's mindless entertainment that tells a rather corny but moving tale of two people brought together and torn apart by fate, and it's mindless entertainment that just *happened* to make millions at the box office, and just *happened* to scoop Oscars left and right. What are you going to do about that?What I like about ""Titanic"" is the simplicity of its plot (yes, it has one). I hate to reiterate, but a story about two different individuals falling in love while they're on the legendary Titanic doesn't get anymore complicated than that. Call me a sap if you must, but my attempts at swallowing the huge lump I had in my throat when the film concluded were futile; one cannot help but be touched by Jack's sacrifice for Rose. And it also helps that there's real chemistry between DiCaprio (who's a truly gifted actor) and Winslet, and again, you can't help but want them to be together. I usually stay away from romance films as a lot of them are crap and have retarded plots, but ""Titanic"" is an exception. It's 3 hours long, and throughout those 3 hours, there's not a boring minute.Let me first declare that my admiration for DiCaprio has got nothing to do with looks. I have just recently became a huge fan of his, and if it's got to do with looks, shouldn't I be obsessed (for lack of a better word) with him 3 years ago? Having that said, despite what a lot of people think, DiCaprio is more than a teen idol or a pretty boy with no acting talent. Jack Dawson may not be an awfully hard character to play, but DiCaprio excelled in his role, like he always does. He's one of the most talented actors of his generation (others include Joaquin Phoenix), and his works before ""Titanic"" should more or less prove that.Something to ponder about: If ""Titanic"" was an independent movie with a budget of much less than what it had, would you hate it too?",Titanic

431,Theflyace,A Masterpiece from James Cameron,10,13 February 2014,"Once in every decade since the inception of the motion picture camera, comes a film that seems to transcend criticism and stands the test of time as one of the all time greats. Such is the case with James Cameron's magnum opus, Titanic. This epic recreation of the ocean liner's ill-fated maiden voyage offers everything one can ask for, and more. There is spectacle and dramatic images that sticks with viewers for a very long time.The film begins as a frame story, with a 101 year old survivor, Rose (played by Gloria Stuart), telling a team of treasure hunters and scientists her experience on the Titanic. As a younger woman (now played by Kate Winslet) Rose traveled in first class on the Titanic with her materialistic mother and her haughty fiancée Cal (played by Billy Zane) Rose feels completely suffocated by the stiff and mind numbing activities and chatter that comes with being rich, and wants to break out and just do something exciting. Her life changes when she meets third-class artist Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) As the two talk and hang out more and more, they begin to fall for one another. Of course, her mother and fiancée disapprove mainly because he is poor. Everything comes to head when the ship hits an iceberg and begins to sink to her inevitable doom. Some people have made the joke to death that this film is essentially ""Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic."" I see this as only somewhat true, as there are indeed similar elements, but the real story would detract from a by-the-numbers correlation between the stories. Here the love story really works on many levels. Rose and Jack do not fall in love at first sight. When they start talking with one another, they see that they do have much in common. It takes a few days but they decide that they are best for each other and fall completely in love.Cameron has done something very special with all the characters characters in this film. He has always been noted for putting characters and interactions above the story, and so he does here too. Jack, Rose, Cal, Ruth, and Lovejoy are all fictional characters of course, but they all interact very convincingly with the real-life characters. In this way, when the ship sinks, the audience has built up and emotional connection to both fictional and real characters, allowing for more heartbreaking truth when most of the characters die or are in peril when the ship is sinking.The casting of this movie is phenomenal. I have to credit casting director Mali Finn and Cameron for really finding great actors, and some of the best character actors in the business. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet forever made a splash (no pun intended) as two of Hollywood's best leading actors, and have so far proved that they are two of the best.When production began on this film, Cameron knew partial sets and models simply wouldn't do. So he and his crew went out and actually built a huge version of the ship, carpets and all. He is a perfectionist, therefore everything on the ship had to be artistically and physically correct, to lend a greater sense of verisimilitude when the audience viewed it in 1997. It looks simply breathtaking, and we feel like we have been transported to the actual ship itself. As far as we know, Cameron probably knows the Titanic than anyone, so when its shown here in its glory, we believe it. Of course, Titanic is about the sinking of the ""unsinkable"" ship. The final hour of the film is indeed the most gripping, as we see the ship start slipping beneath the waves. Cameron uses his extensive knowledge of special effects to very convincingly present the sinking in all of its gruesome truth. Its very well paced, finely edited, and of course, spectacular. And what makes it even more moving is we have gotten to know the characters and therefore its very heartbreaking when most of them die. The aftermath is of course, very tragic and cruel, because we all know what happened. But when it came on screen, we were still broken by it. When those who couldn't get into the lifeboat drown, we wish in our hearts that they could have. There is more her that will shock viewers, but I wouldn't dream in a million years of revealing the ending of Jack and Rose's story arc.Just as I claimed for Steven Spielberg directing Schindler's List, here, it initially seems like James Cameron is the wrong man for the job at first glance. He is known for action films, no romances or dramas. Yet somehow, this is the greatest film he has ever done. He directs with a keen vision, and is quite unrelenting in getting his vision across, hence why many people despise working with him. But his passion and dedication to the project shines through all the way through its three hour running time. Such dedication won the film multiple Oscars (11 to be precise) Cameron himself took home 4 in one night, cementing his status as one of the most successful filmmakers of our generation.This is one of the best films to grace the cinema. The sheer might and size of the picture doesn't dwarf the actors, who are given the chance to breath and connect us to one of the most infamous tragedies in history. A sharp criticism of man's hubris, and a stirring tribute to those who lost their lives that night. Such is how I can describe Titanic.",Titanic
432,james_corck3,Ship happens,8,19 January 2006,"When I heard ""Titanic"" and I heard ""DiCaprio"" I thought ""Romeo and Juliet 2"". How wrong I was! James Cameron takes his amazing film making and, with maybe a weaker screenplay than in all his other movies, he makes this impressive and unforgettable exercise of construction, and I mean building the ship and building a rising climax that will go with you after watch the movie. The story jumps from the predictable stuff (you know the ship sinks, that never changes) to the heart and soul of characters that have no idea of their future, for good or bad. All starts with a simple drawing, and from that simplicity we move to jaw-dropping chases in the guts of the ship, hear-breaking love moments and many extras falling. The rhythm is a little bit slow in the first two acts, but from the moment the iceberg and the ice enter in scene, wow, here is Mr Aliens again. Kate Winslet moves from classic first class lady to Lt Ripley's daughter, the ship of dreams turns into the bath of nightmares, the history accuracy fights against Cameron's Machiavellian film making, and at the end, you just cry in joy, sadness and suffering. The best sequence of all this? The ship splitting is awesome, but Nearer my God to thee is a heart-touching, tear-jerking, whimper moment, with that Irish mother cuddling her children before die, the Captain facing his destiny and the band playing to the very end. ""Gentlemen, i's been a privilege being with you tonight"". Maybe that line and not ""I am the king of the world"" Cameron should said in the Oscars.",Titanic
433,srobi280,More garbage... what a surprise!,3,21 April 2006,"Let me start off by saying that there really can't be any spoilers about this movie, as anyone who knows anything about history already knows how this film will end. The Titanic is going to sink! What a surprise! There are three major reasons why I don't like this movie.Reason 1: We know how the film is going to end before we even see it. The ship is going to sink. If filmmakers want to make a movie in which the audience already knows what is going to happen, they need to do a better job than to simply turn it into a sappy love story. Which brings me to the second reason.Reason 2: This is another historical event turned into a sappy love story, blended in which a whole lot of Hollywood inaccuracy. The acting is terrible, and the characters are very uninteresting.Reason 3: Time. This movie is more than three hours long! Is that really necessary? No it isn't. It is a three hours of my life that I could have used way more productively. It is a three hours of my life, gone forever! Wasted! And I can never get it back! I was thankful when DiCaprio died, because I knew the movie was almost over. I can't believe this movie got so much praise. Its right there in the same league as ""Pearl Harbor"".

440,intern-88,Taking Titanic seriously will end in disaster,6,6 June 2012,"The announcement that James Cameron's 1997 blockbuster, Titanic, was to be rereleased to mark the centenary of the ocean liner's disastrous maiden voyage was met with a considerable amount of vitriol from historians and cultural critics.Alongside the somewhat more sober events set to take place on 15 April to commemorate the sinking of the 'unsinkable ship' - including an exhibition in Belfast, where RMS Titanic was built, and a series of seminars in Nova Scotia, close to where it sank - many saw this as Cameron once again cashing in on the tragedy with his fiercely sentimental film. The fact that it has been remastered in 3D has made its release feel all the more in poor taste.I was all of six years old when Titanic first hit our screens. It was, of course, one of the biggest blockbusters of my childhood. So large was its impact, in fact, that on several occasions during my schooling I was subjected to Titanic-themed history and art projects, all of which involved watching the three-and-a-bit-hour behemoth as a primary piece of research. In the years since, it has become the nostalgia movie of choice among my friends. So I've seen it more times than I'd care to count. Seeing it remastered on the big screen, however, made its inadequacy as a historical film more laughably evident than ever.Given the policed divide between the haughty classes of the upper decks and the lowly paupers of steerage, and the shameful priority given to the wealthy when it came to filling the lifeboats, the Titanic tragedy has often been held up as a telling snapshot of the class politics of the time. Through the star-crossed, and completely fictional, love affair between penniless rogue Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and drippy debutante Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), Cameron attempts to explore the inherent tensions which the ship contained. This rendering, however, is reductive to say the least: the gilded dining rooms of first class are populated by sarcastic, brandy-swilling poshos and the steerage is full of arm-wrestling Germanics and Guinness-guzzling Irishmen who are prone to punch one another or break into a fiddle recital at the slightest provocation. Probably the most coherent message about class we are given, as the two lovers move between their respective camps, is that it's much more fun to dance a jig below decks than it is to discuss oil prices over caviar.The stories that survived the ship's demise are a mix of startling inhumanity and incredible heroism. But Cameron's manipulative approach often robs his material of its inherent pathos and breeds drastic historical inaccuracies. In its turbulent second half, poignant moments come thick and fast, but many of them are either wholly fictional or shamelessly skewed for the sake of taking some cheap tugs at the heartstrings. The 'unsinkable' Molly Brown, who in the real tragedy insisted the half-full lifeboats return to collect those still stranded in the ice-cold water, is robbed of her triumphant moment and recast as a much less domineering symbol of feminine subordination. Similarly, as is widely known, the ship's string quartet played on top deck as the Titanic went down, in order to calm the passengers, but even this incredible part of the tale is soured by the schmaltz Cameron lays over the scene. As the quartet finish their rendition of 'Orpheus and Eurydice', one of the violinists turns to his fellow musicians and says, 'Gentleman, it has been a privilege playing with you tonight'. Such candy-coated moments continually deaden the impact of the film's rich source material.Cameron once quipped that he only agreed to make the film because a free deep sea dive to the Titanic wreck came as part of the package, suggesting this was never intended to be his magnum opus. Indeed, given the director's famous meticulousness, the film feels like he has been oddly careless in places. Kate Winslet's accent is allowed to wander between American, Irish and English with little consequence, and despite a rigorous casting process for the part of Rose's malevolent fiancé Cal - which saw innumerable famous actors rejected - the appalling Billy Zane was selected, who ends up playing the role like a camp Count Dracula.Despite all this, the clunking one-liners, the dreadful acting and the cheesy artifice actually gives Titanic its distinctive charm. When watching the released film on the big screen, I was surprised to find that most of my fellow audience members were giggling along at all of the abysmal moments, which also had kept me returning to it over the years. For myself and others it seems, this film is more of a trip down 90s memory lane than it is an historically accurate snapshot of a turn-of-the-century tragedy. As such, criticising Titanic on the grounds of historical infidelity is tantamount to damning Top Gun for giving a rose-tinted portrayal of the lives of fighter pilots - doing so would be to miss the point of what makes these films so memorable.I completely agree with those who feel Titanic has no place in the proceedings for the centenary of the original tragedy. Not because Cameron's tacky blockbuster does a disservice to the 1,517 people who lost their lives, but because this film is so inescapably naff that really it shouldn't be taken that seriously. I urge fans to go and enjoy this guilty pleasure with a clear conscience",Titanic
441,critic-22,Grand adventure on the high seas,8,14 January 1999,"I would like to say I really liked Titanic in terms of suspense and being in the grand mode of other classic long drama movies like 'Gone with the Wind'. The acting was good and other aspects like social class, hierarchy and set design issues/props was excellent.On the other the hand, the sex scene (though brief) was unnecessary and distracted from the romance element, certainly not following the scenes of other classic older movies of a non-explicit nature. Other post-modern features was the types of language used by Kate Winslet as Rose, some profanity and constant use of God's name in vain. Notwithstanding these problems the movie shows quite impressive what can be done with 100's of millions of pounds.I think that movies that cost that much and makes a sizeable profit should have at least a proportion given to charity for the real people who are freezing to death, are ill or of great need for food.

444,Raptorclaw155,"Historically Accurate for its Time, Yet is Hindered by it being Directed by James Cameron",6,3 May 2020,"One of the interesting things about this film is that it's pretty clear how Titanic and Avatar are both cut from, essentially, the same cloth despite being two completely different films on paper.As it is widely understood, a lot of time, effort, and money went into making this film possible and it shows. Aside from a couple moments here and there, Titanic is still a fairly impressive looking film to date. Of course, nowadays there is more information about Titanic's interior design with the aid of 20 more years of research behind us and, thus, there are some inaccuracies in this film in that regard, as well as the way the ship sank, but overall, it is clear that they went to painstaking lengths to make this film look as accurate and authentic as possible and I think they succeeded. Of course when you have James Cameron at the helm, usually films end up turning out looking quite impressive so it's no surprise that this film would be any different.However, James Cameron is also one of the reasons why this film falls very short of what it could have been. This has much to do with the quality of writing and its execution. Cal Hockley is little short of a diet James Bond villain and I have no idea what his motivations for pursuing his obviously aloof fiancee aside from serving as an antagonist for Jack. The guy shows no interest in Rose, yet he says he loves her and it seems like the film, at some point, is trying to frame him as being truthful about it- but who knows at this point? On top of that, there's also the same writing trap that this film fall into as Avatar would years later with the very cartoonish poor people good, rich people bad theme which only ages worse when one looks into the real reasons why ships of that time were organized by class.There's also a lot of blatant misrepresentation when it comes to a myriad of issues including the crew of the Titanic and the ship's lifeboat situation-which are all comments made with the aide of hindsight- which makes for a pretty bad representation of history.One of my biggest criticisms of this kind of love story is that usually the female lead is fairly plain and the male lead is where all the personality and likability is. For Titanic, the reverse is true. Rose is extremely likable and has a lot of personality and Kate Winslet is the star of the show, in my opinion. Jack is quite plain on the other hand. I know DiCaprio is a popular actor but I didn't feel as if he really added anything to this role. It just seemed that they hired him to play himself.Despite my criticisms, this is still a pretty well-made film. It has a lot of issues but it is still worth seeing. The love story is predictable but I don't think people watch romance films for their expectations to be subverted anyway. It's far from a bad film, and despite its 3 hour run time it makes excellent use of it. This is probably the date night film to end all date night films until The Notebook came out at the very least that says something.",Titanic

I didn't think that any film that put fictional characters in a real setting, especially one as dramatic as the Titanic disaster could succeed. I was wrong.""Titanic"" is an excellent film in all respects. Both DiCaprio and Winslet have a realistic and charismatic chemistry with each other. Kathy Bates was born to play the role of Molly Brown, Billy Zane is wonderfully despicable as the intended husband for Winslet, and Bernard Hill lends a great deal of respect to his role as Captain John Smith.But the real star is indeed, the ship itself. It is absolutely phenomenal how the filmmakers recreated the legendary ship for the film. The grand staircase with the carving of hope and glory crowning time, the staterooms, the ballroom, the smoking lounges, all replicated with incredible attention to detail.The details surrounding the sinking were incredible as well. I believe this is the first motion picture to address the fact that the ship split in half as it sank, instead of going down whole. The entire sinking sequence is incredibly chilling and you will not be able to turn your eyes away from it.If you are one of the few that have not yet seen Titanic, watch it soon, and see if it doesn't amaze and move you.And by the way... if you find yourself in Orlando, FL, check out the Titanic exhibition. You won't be disappointed.",Titanic

It filled me with good emotions, refreshed my mind in some way, I absolutely in love with it. And I think, everything about this movie is great, EXCEPT scenes from ""nowadays"" : I can't see any emotions on the face of this old lady, I hate this thing, when she tells something and It feels like I SHOULD feel sorry for this non - acting bag with bones, because I KNOW that she is Rose, this is the point when me and you MOST feel sorry, cheap trick. No hate to this actress, but to the director, I just hate this useless old living.
Nobody ever asked you to invite 87 year old actress, if you can't find any acting one, then cut this scene, use cosmetics, do anything that not harms the movie. I think that all those scenes spoils the great movie and without them it can be called a masterpiece. These people are useless, they take my time, they don't do anything, these scenes not ever look that great like Titanic story itself! All that they do is playing cheap emotional games "" feel sorry for me""; ""look at something you know"" and this is disgusting! I feel really mad about that part, and I feel sad for such a great movie. I would recommend you to skip all of them and enjoy this piece of art.",Titanic

The point is that this movie captures you for like three hours, and never once did I look at the time and see how long it's been or how long it's left. This movie deserved all the Oscars, all the credit and all the good reviews. I love this movie, a classic movie, and I can't imagine how anyone would think it's bad or that it didn't deserve all the credit it got. Watch it and enjoy it and don't think about how long it is.

457,Falcon-51,Film about doomed ocean liner attracts the masses,9,4 April 2002,"What can be said about `Titanic' that hasn't already been said? Seriously who hasn't seen it? Well if your one of the few and you finally decided to take the uhmm. Splash (pun intended) there are a few rules you need to remember. First, give yourself time for an intermission the film is quite long. Second, the film caters to all people. There is a love story for the pre-teen girls and for hopeful romantics (generally women) and for us guys there are some cool special effects in one of the most intense disaster films ever made. The final rule, sit back and enjoy.Working with a `Titanic' budget James Cameron (director) put this gem together and created this intriguing story. Obviously the fate of the doomed ocean liner is true, but the fictitious love story is thrown in to attract more viewers. Warning there is a brief, but tastefully done nude scene and parental guidance is suggested. Also the illustrations of death and dying in the later parts of the film may be a bit too much for younger viewers. Now aside from that, I mean honestly, what more convincing do you need? The film earned over a billion dollars worldwide and scored a number of Oscars including best director and best picture.",Titanic

All they had to do was to tie Rose's life jacket around the board, so that there would be enough buoyancy to keep their bodies above water. James Cameron wanted Jack to freeze and drown, and that was a bad decision on his part. No one wants to watch a long movie and have lovers parted in a flimsy, insensitive and selfish scene. So, the ending ruined the entire movie for me...it just did. James Cameron must enjoy watching people leave a movie feeling betrayed and deceived by Rose. True love by Rose...not in my eyes. Plus, Jack would never have met Rose. The first and second class passenger decks were had gate locks from the third class passenger decks due to immigration and health laws. Total non-fiction. If you are going to make a historical drama, then you have to do your homework because people will believe what you have presented to them.",Titanic

I had heard it was a ""chick-flick"", and that the director had incorporated fictional characters into the real life drama. I was pleasantly surprised when I left the theatre. The movie delivered a compelling and factual account of the disaster, intertwined with the fictional main characters. Jack and Rose were important to the movie. They really told the story of so many of the actual Titanic victims who remain unknown to this day.Close to 1500 souls went down with the ship. The movie helped me to see their struggle to survive, and what were the shocking effects of hitting the iceberg. The tragedy at the World Trade Center certainly correlates with the Titanic disaster for modern times.

In the context of the biggest shipwreck, the sad and beautiful love story is the main line of the movie, which is extremely provocative and tearful. The story starts with the search for ""the heart of the sea"", with the narration of Ruth, an old survivor of the shipwreck, as the introduction, and uses the flashback to introduce the audience into the mood of an involuntary role replacement. It's wonderful to follow the characters.",Titanic

As for the rest: childish screenplay,idiotic intrigue,a good-hearted Robin Hood Picasso--DeCaprio in a relationship with Ms.Rich Bitch (I thought this looked like a lesbian relationship, with Winslet being the dominant partner).As for the depiction of the class issue,it reminded me of some Communist propaganda stories.The whole feel of the movie is second-rate sentimentalism.The other characters are incredibly one-sided (Billy Zane looks like a Bond villain and the rich people are the worst bastards I have ever seen).1 billion dollars wasted in a giant corny video-clip.This movie made me sick.As for Celine Dion and her over-hyped song...no comment,except I had no idea that cheesy and corny are the qualities needed for an Oscar-winning song.Now I know.

The labour of love's only due comparison is to Hollywood's yesteryear classics such as ""Gone With The Wind.""With a commentary on social classes and the trappings of the Victorians, Cameron goes beyond his norm -- and excells!!Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet charge the screen as Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukateer, respectfully.  A strong supporting cast including ""The Invisible Man""s Gloria Stuart, who carries the film in flashback, brillantly.If you're one of the very few people who haven't seen it yet, be aware that you are missing one of Hollywood's finest films.

467,Rueiro,Titanic: the parody,3,11 June 2016,"This film is so full of absurdities and clichés that it is to all the previous Titanic films what ""Airplane"" is to the ""Airport"" saga and ""Blazing Saddles"" is to the Western genre. The unhappy high society girl goes down to third-class deck although it is out of bounds for her. She wants to jump overboard, but she is stopped by a happy-go-lucky nobody with no future and with nothing to his name but the clothes he is wearing on. As a reward he is invited by Hockley to dine fist-class with the jet-set so they can make fun of his lack of education and manners. But he gets along without making too much of a fool of himself, and charms everyone around the table but stiff Hockley and Rose's toff horrid mother. But bored to death from so many starched collars, small talk and no being able to scratch his bum,belch or pick his nose, Jack eventually sneaks away with Rose to a merry party down in third-class where one can swear, spit, get plastered on cheap beer, belch, fart and throw up until they fall flat on their faces. The next day a self-confident and jolly Jack enters the out-of-bounds territory of first class again looking for Rose, greets Mr Andrews like and old mate and trots along without being bothered at all. Although he sticks out like a sore thumb no one seems to notice him. Feel yourself at home, laddie, just don't take a leak in the flower vases, that's all. He is only stopped when he tries to disrupt a solemn religious service. That is the only one thing that cannot be tolerated by any means. Randy Rose asks Jack to draw her naked, and he does so while maintaining his coolness and concentrating seriously on his work as she lies there displaying all her jewels. But instead of banging her in the luxurious comfort of her private chamber they go down to the hull???... Meanwhile Hockley the Wally finally realises that his girl is bending over for that miserable third-class gutter rat, and boy, that drives him bananas. Then the ship bumps into an iceberg because the two idiotic sailors on watch duty are far more interested on the antics of the two horny kids rather than on doing the job they are being paid for in the first place. Here we go then: the unsinkable Titanic commences to sink and the movie finally takes off after 90 minutes of utter boredom. Mr Andrews rushes to the officers' room to deliver his diagnosis, and now there comes the most hilarious scene in the film. As Andrews states that the ship is already dead, company president Ismail almost has an apoplexy. You see his face, with his eyes almost popping out, his choking cry of ""But that is impossible! This ship cannot sink!!"" He is babbling in disbelief, his blood pressure rocketing up to the verge of a coronary, spit flying out of his mouth And Andrews turns to him -you can almost see his eyes rolling ""I built her, sir. She's made of iron. It can sink, and I assure you it will"" And that shuts Ismail up for good. So, now they've got just two hours to get out of there. First-class people go first, of course, since they are the ones who paid more for being here in the first place. Second-class will go after if still there is time. As to third-class well, we just learn now that the lifeboats have a full capacity for only half of the people on board, 700 of which are third-class rubble. Well, officers, you know the procedures: women and children first, and no paupers jumping the queue or you'll be fired. And then, if there is still time and a few empty places left, well just chuck a few ragamuffins into the boats and then save yourselves. And good luck. A third-class ticket for the Titanic did cost the equivalent to 1,500 euros in today's money, and a first-class cost 115,000. So you were treated accordingly to what you paid for, as simple as that. Although time is running out Hockley keeps his hair on, confident that he will buy his way out with a thick wad of notes in the last minute, but meanwhile he is about to play his last villainy: accusing poor old Jack of stealing the mother of all diamonds, and to do that he relies on the faithful assistance of his devoted butler. Nasty Lovejoy frames Jack and has him handcuffed deep below so that he will drown quicker. But stubborn Rose, in an almost superhuman feat that will have feminist radicals raving, sets him free, they get back to deck and try to board a boat. The outraged Hockley, now on the verge of an apoplexy,chases them with a gun in a comical sequence that culminates with another ridiculous line ""I put the diamond in the coat and I put the coat on her!"" The ship finally sinks into history, but the pair of randy doves manage to stay afloat. Now, the water is freezing and no one can survive in it for more than half an hour at the most. Yet Jack seems to last for hours long after everyone else floating around have succumbed to hypothermia. But eventually he dies too, because the story was meant to be a tearjerker in the first place. Miraculously enough, Rose, despite wearing her soaking clothes on all night, survives without even getting a cough (!!!)",Titanic

Although it has been many years since the movie was released, every feeling it brings, every picture is deeply imprinted in my mind. People are small in the face of death. Some of the people in the film are not willing to die and bribe a crew. Some people press others' bodies underwater to prevent them from sinking. In order to protect their own safety, it can be said that all kinds of human ugliness are exposed in people's eyes. It is clear at a glance, but there will also be people like the protagonist.

472,longcooljolie,Pure popcorn entertainment and an astounding achievement,10,12 July 2010,"So far, this is the most heavily user-reviewed movie I have encountered in IMDb. Here is yet another one (sorry)! During the summer of 1997, the studios ran grand coming attractions for ""Titanic,"" which capsulized the entire story and even showed in detail what would happen to Jack and Rose. It was tempting to think ""...why even see the movie? You already know what is going to happen!"" The movie absolutely cleaned up during the holiday season of 1997 and into the first few months of 1998. The theatrical experience of watching it on a big screen with stereo sound was beyond compare (my sister swears that the cinema in Cincinnati where she saw it cranked the air conditioning during the sinking scenes to give viewers an extra dimension to the frigid cold endured by all the passengers).On the surface, the plot lines and basic story seem trite and contrived (poor boy meets rich girl). The fantastic acting by the leads and the direction of the massive cast of extras along with the superhuman attention to detail are what makes Titanic jump from the screen at the viewer.Think about the whole ""king of the world"" sequence with Jack and Fabrizio and the ""flying"" sequence with Jack and Rose. In the hands of a lesser director, both of these would have come across as self-aggrandizing pap, but the way both scenes is shot and Leo DeCaprio/Kate Winslet's uncanny abilities and chemistry sent a shot of ecstasy throughout the whole theater. These scenes, along with several others, works well to capture the fabulous grandeur of the original Titanic.What is most often missed in reviews are the performances of actors in lesser roles, such as Billy Zane's turn as an elegant cad, David Warner's perfect casting as the classy ""thug"" bodyguard, Kathy Bates nailing her gauche, nouveau riche embodiment of the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (she was a last minute casting), and scores of other astounding recreations from the captain to the top hatted billionaire and his eyes popping out when the water floods the stateroom.According to the trivia page, cinemas wore out their copies and needed replacements. People have probably also worn out their VHS, DVD and blue-ray copies. Nothing will wear out the enduring appeal of this classic as pure, full-on entertainment.",Titanic

474,joliefille411,Sinking fast...,2,26 April 2007,"... and yet not nearly fast enough. When this movie first splashed onto the big screen, I was in the middle of the prime target: young, teenaged girls who all too easily swooned over the new ""it"" guy, Leo, and wanted a taste of ""adult"" love. Thank heavens I somehow missed it on that round, only to have one of my friends pull it out nearly a decade (has it really been so long?) later for a girl's night. I was stunned. The hype created by the Oscars and gushing of my peers set this movie on a pinnacle from whence the movie plummeted to the bottom of the ocean to join its namesake. If only they had left the story there. The first TWO HOURS were spent dilly-dallying aimlessly along the ship following Rose,a girl who is deprived a life by her dominating fiancée, her conniving mother, and ultimately her own self. She goes back and forth from suicidal to ""equal rights"" to ""you are not of my element"" with schizophrenic dexterity. I have great admiration for Kate Winslet, but this character was gratingly awful to watch. Mr. DiCaprio was little more than a pretty face during the movie. His lack of drive proves him not a knight in shining armor, but meh, he's just not as bad as the villain. And somehow, they fall madly into doomed love because *gasp* the ship is going to sink! So now, the ship has fiiiiinally begun to sink, but wait! You still have another HOUR to watch the main people get stuck, cut to people drowning, oh wait Rose and Jack are safe, cut to more drowning. Oh wait, the ships still sinking, so Rose and Jack aren't safe again, oh they're safe, wait no..... DIE ALREADY! So after three hours, Rose finally says I'll never let go! upon which she immediately lets go and is magically found unfrozen in a colony of frozen solid bodies. Yes, its amazing how it goes.So why 2 stars? I'll chalk it up to the romantic notion behind the ship, which has managed to still fascinate people a century later. The recreation of detail was admittedly stunning, although I got just as much out of a Titanic mystery computer game. Normally, even if I don't care for a movie, I'd say knock yourself out if you still wanna see it, but at 3 painful hours long, I'd definitely go with a no.",Titanic

Just when the movie becomes (historically) interesting, the other person grabs the remote and switches it to a pedestrian daytime soap opera. Did Kate have to be on hand at every step that led to the sinking? (her and Leo are on the side of the deck where the ice hits, of course, JUST missing them; OH! let's put her next to the Captain when he learns Titanic's fate and lack of life boats). The tragedy was story enough and James Cameron did a brilliant business decision to shove a pre-teen love opera to the foreground so girls could flock to the theater over and over to see Leo alive again and again and again...! Give the channel changer back so we can please continue with the story of the ship. Yes, I heard some crying when Leo sank into the abyss...But no sniveling when the little boy (who Leo tries to rescue before the boy is grabbed away from his panicky father) is swept away by the flooded corridor. So much for crying priorities!!I'm a big Cameron fan! Titanic has left him permanently wealthy. And he's tapped into a genre the same way Lucas tapped with Star Wars in attracting a select category of people that were willing to see this over and over (Titanic's billion dollar revenue was the result of many repeat viewings worldwide combining history with poster boy imagery).Special effects were brilliant! But I'll take the 1958 black and white ""A Night To Remember"" movie instead.Today's lesson: If you're going to use an ax to free someone shackled with chains, don't aim, close your eyes tight, THEN swing hard so you won't see the spraying blood.

And lo !! The beautiful girl turns her face and kisses him deeply on his lips while they are still on the bow of the ship with arms outstretched- --one of the most romantic moments ever filmed on celluloid.....But it doesn't finish there for the lucky Dawson....The girl takes him to her room and poses for a nude portrait while Dawson tries to paint her naked body with trembling hands.....And then the inevitable happens.....the two yearning bodies meet for making sweat soaked love.....Does it really matter that the girls fiancé takes terrible revenge by getting Dawson arrested ??......For the beautiful girl never leaves him even though the Titanic starts sinking after hitting an iceberg.....and she gets him free.....Yes free to meet their fate together as the ship goes to the bottom of the sea....But only one of them is going to make it alive.....The chivalrous Dawson makes sure that his girl is that one.....But he's more than that---He's large hearted too....And how so ? Well , before he dies he makes her promise that she wont let his death deter her ; that she should live life to the full and make babies---babies he knows she will make with other men.....And his reward for that---She goes on to live life like he told her preserving his memory and adding his surname to her name....She becomes Rose Dawson.....And for that fact alone , I wouldn't mind changing my place with Dawson's even though I might go down with the sinking Titanic.....But if I cant do that , at least I don't mind seeing the movie again after 14 years....And I don't mind the fact that the 3D effects are not good and hardly make an impression.....For the photography just like last time , was great , the sets were amazing , the special effects were scintillating , the music was heart stopping and the acting by all actors was just special.....What else do you need.....Oh need.....I still feel the need to change places with Leonardo Di Caprio and make love to Kate Winslet after painting her nude while her fiancé Billy Zane boils in anger.....But thats not gonna happen is it.....So I will satisfy myself with the thought that I got the chance to see the movie again on big screen in the name of seeing it in 3D.....I sincerely hope that one day a 4D version comes so that I can see it on silver screen again.....Verdict---do I even need to say.....",Titanic

It's a very immersive experience as there is so much attention to detail with the incredible set designs, costume designs and makeup giving it a very authentic look. James Horners sweeping music score is heartfelt and intense. James Cameron is a magnificent director who before this made action sci-fi blockbusters like the Terminator films and The Abyss.

The casting was excellent with the possible exception of Leonardo DeCaprio - somehow he just seemed a bit young for the part. Chris O'Donnell or Josh Lucas would've been a bit closer to the mark here. As far as the Rose character, wonderfully portrayed by Kate Winslet, it didn't take a lot of time to see the possible real person she was based on. Her mannerisms and defiance of custom seemed to emulate the late Alice Roosevelt Longworth (1884-1980), daughter of Theodore Roosevelt. As I watched Kate, I began to see Alice, literally! If you don't know much about Alice and her later impact on Washington DC politics and mores, there are several great bios available.

490,wereuat06-1,A Movie People Love to Hate...,10,22 December 2006,"When I first seen this movie I loved it from beginning to end. I mean it was simply beautiful. The effects were amazing, the acting was great, and the story was excellent. So I don't see why so many people hate this movie. It racked up 11 Oscars for a reason. A lot of people do not like the love story put into this tragic event almost a century ago. Hello people without the love story it would just be another documentary in this tragic event. I thought the story played perfect in with a movie of this caliber. It also had comic relief from what it was about to lead up to from Molly Brown(Kathy Bates). Also the great stories by the ever so hated Jack who was played perfectly by Leonardo DiCaprio who has become a icon playing parts such as The Aviator and The Departed. Also we cannot forget about Rose DeWitt Bukater his love played by Kate Winslet. These to had perfect chemistry throughout the entire movie and made it as sad as it was to become. I think the love story and all around them brought this story more into vision to people about how sad that tragic day really was.In this movie there were also great special effects supplied by Robert Legato, Mark A. Lasoff, Thomas L. Fisher Michael Kanfer who won the Academy Awards for best special effects, and did they deserve it. From the beginning where the boat was at the dock under the sun, or when it road freely through the night or even the sad climatic sinking of the ship, it was all put together so great. The cinematography in this movie was also greatly produced by Russell Carpenter who gathered in Academy Award for cinematography. We cant forget about Gloria Stuart who played the older Rose perfectly and told the story as if there were no flaws as if we couldn't help but believe the love between her and Jack that was tragically ended. This movie deserved every Award it won from music which was great to best sound to best art which was extremely excellent in this movie.I think James Cameron deserves every award he won for putting together this masterpiece in a simply magnificent form. He took a tragic event and put it into so many peoples minds for the rest of there lives. He was even able to include a protagonist and antagonist in an event like this. I don't know how you could not like this movie. In the effects and acting column it has Peter Jackson proportions. Every scene is beautiful and amazing. If you have never seen this movie don't judge it and just bye it. I recommend this movie for anyone who is up for an amazing performance and a great love story. I give this movie a 10 out of 10.",Titanic

The audience knew the ship was going to sink, but leading up to the ship sinking made you care about the people and crew. This film was about building on the characters. Kate Winslet stole the film.However, Leonardo with Kate Winslet made this film unbelievable and annoying. It's hard to imagine Kate with the homeless and unattractive Leonardo. Kate definitely deserved to be recognized for her performance and Leonardo should have never been mentioned. In reality Kate's character would have never been with the unattractive and homeless Leonardo over Billy's character of a millionaire. Billy is so much more attractive and successful than Leonardo who is such a boy.Leonardo was a cry baby when he wasn't nominated for an Oscar and Kate was. Kate gave a remarkable performance and nothing stood out with Leonardo.",Titanic
492,Markmainwaring,Dull rubbish...,3,11 March 2006,This film is dull trash and highly overrated. I wonder how it got to be so successful. It is clichéd beyond belief. The story is dull and again clichéd and best bit is at the end when the boat crashes which should of been the whole film (and why I rated it 3 and not 1).Playing on all the old cinema clichés. The film portrays the rich as unhappy fakes who are nasty and vindictive. And the working class as the salts of the Earth. Happy and content. This is just the tip of the iceberg (sorry).Acting is awful as well and I cared little or non for any of the characters. I am still unsure why this was a blockbuster both critically and commercially. And what were all the Oscars for.James Cameron spent 200 Million Dollars on this trash. Maybe no one dared to say it was rubbish at the time.Terrible theme music as well.

I have no doubt that the special effects are very clever and took people an awful lot of hours and megabytes...but where do they take us? A computer generated ship with generated seagulls looks exactly that. The sets are spectacular yet manage to scream out that they are expensive sets rather than that they are the inside of a living working ship. And don't get me started on the levels of my indifference towards the talentless Mr.DiCaprio who bestrides the film in the same way as most children do when stumbling into a grown-ups party. Watch A Night To Remember if you want to feel the real emotion of the Titanic's sinking and watch this if you want to spend three hours seeing Mr.Cameron trying to show us how clever he is...and failing.",Titanic

497,chrisbishop5000,"The most breathtaking love story ever! MUCH better than ""Gone With The Wind""",10,1 December 2006,"This film is underrated and yet so beautiful! In 1997, the world was introduced to a heartbreaking, uplifting film which provides you 3 hours and 20 minutes or so with romance, adventure, danger, the spirit of kindness, offering the person you love your own life (just like Jack Dawson did for Rose). I ask you - what more can a movie give you? Tell me that! Even the scenes like when Rose takes off her clothes and Jack draws her naked, and the moderate/strong bad language which comes in frequently doesn't put me off. I think the certificate should've been 15+. I personally do not think the mature sequences in this movie are suitable for a big kid aged 12. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are the our stars in this outstanding epic. Their characters are far from similar because Rose is rich and she mixes with snobby people and yet she doesn't like them at all and she's also feisty. Jack is poor and likes to hang out with his mates and despite his rough edges, he has a heart of gold! He is such a loving, selfless young man who even took his own life. Anyway, when Rose can't put up with being somebody she doesn't want, she bolts out of Titanic's main restaurant and attempts to commit suicide by jumping off the ship. Jack sees what she's doing and insists that she doesn't drop off the railing. At first she tells him to goaway, but he holds out his hand and she gives him her hand. She slips and nearly falls into the sea. He uses all his strength to lift her back onto the boat. From then, they gradually fall in love with each other. This feature-film makes me cry big tears every time I see it. I sob in the same way a person would do if they were mourning the death of a loved one. I feel as if I may not stop crying for at least an hour after the film finishes. Even some of the scenes that aren't sad make me cry. Like; when Jack feels upset when Rose tries to avoid him because she's engaged to Cal Hockley (a heartless and violent man) just to please him but the evening of the day when she tells him not to keep seeing her she has a sudden change of mind and comes to see him at the front of ""Titanic"". He reaches for her hand and tells her to step up onto the railing, let her arms spread out while he supports her and then she believes she's flying and at that point they kiss. It's shot beautifully against evening pink skies - it's just so tearful, knowing this couple are sharing their final evening together and- (Sniffles). Rose says to Jack ""Jack when the ship docks, I'm getting off with you!"", sadly, what I say is ""you mean IF the ship docks!"" and from there all the tragedy of Titanic's collision into the iceberg will come in in only a short matter of time. When it happens Jack is held prisoner right at the bottom of the ship and they leave him there even when the ship is sinking! Luckily, Rose comes to his rescue and releases him. Then, as Rose is rich and Jack is poor, Rose is forced to board a boat and as it lowers he hand which is holding Jack's is pulled away. Cal Hockley menacingly says to Jack as she leaves, ""I always win, Jack"" - uh, not this time buster! But she leaps off the lifeboat and runs to his arms. He runs to her, too, and that's also too emotional to be true. But there's more tragedy to come. When the entire ship sinks to the bottom, after ""the ship's arse snaps"" as that man said at the beginning, Jack and Rose spot a board afloat but it's too small for them BOTH, so very selflessly, Jack lifts her onto the board and he stays in the freezing water. ""You have got to promise me that you'll survive, that you'll make babies and watch them grow. Promise me, Rose, that you'll die a little old lady warm in her bed. But not here, not this night! That divorce was the best thing that ever happened to me it brought me to you. Please, make me that promise."" He kisses her hand for the last time. Rose later tells Jack there's a boat to save them - but he doesn't answer or even move. He has frozen to death. Rose cannot believe it but bravely lets him sink; now I know I'll cry! WHAT A SAD MOVIE!!! But, despite its trauma, ""Titanic"" is irresistible. Over 15s won't be able to help but succumb to its beauty. Far better than the offensive ""Gone with the Wind"". Rose may be feisty but she's certainly not a self-obsessed harpy like Scarlett O'Hara and Jack Dawson is anything but that arrogant cad Rhett Butler, the womanising scumbag! Titanic is VERY underrated and ""Gone With The Wind"" is VERY overrated - absurd but, cest la vie!Gloria Stuart was 86 when she starred as old Rose and with this film she is most associated. Her final film was ""Lands of Plenty"" in 2004. The following year, she contracted cancer but had always appeared well to the public eye. She also looked frail in her old age. James Cameron attended her 100th birthday. For a moment I thought she'd live forever! I am deeply saddened to report that Gloria Stuart died of cancer last Sunday. She was 100 years old. God love her! I showed my mother a beautiful tribute to her on Youtube and she revealed that she could feel Gloria's energy around me, she felt her there. Apparently she put her arm round me then blew me a kiss goodbye.A divine and inspirational woman...GLORIA STUART4th July 1910-26th September 2010",Titanic
498,Dia Klain,"Will sink some hearts, and bury others.",8,10 October 2001,"I have set it upon myself to write this review to tell the trough about Titanic. To expose its number one weakness so that it no longer be confused with any others. Why do so many hate this movie and are ready to swear that it is one of the worst ever made? Perhaps they should expose their eyes to everyday movies more often if they speak thus. Let us examine the movie. The acting, while not all that brilliant, is sufficient for the parts to come through honestly enough. The dialogue, while not the greatest or deepest is appropriate and, let's face it, in view of what comes out now a days, quite descent. The length of the movie may be long but is, I feel, necessary and the movie does hold attention with ought becoming a bore. The special effects are, no one can dispute, magnificent, and the costumes realistic. So what is so incredibly bad about this movie? It is alright. It is, in fact, better then alright. It is a rather darn good movie about love with a historical background. The biggest weakness of this movie is that rather then being viewed as pretty dang good, it was rather viewed as the best thing ever created by man or god. As history shows when something is overrated a lot of people start to boo it for being unworthy, and thus call it total crap.",Titanic

Winslet played a teenager (she was 17. yes, a teenager) trapped in an arranged betrothal not fitting into the upper class she was born into, to perfection. Dicaprio played the poor underclassmen with a compassion you need several views of this film to understand, to perfection. I've learned many new things every time I've seen this movie. (i would right? i was 12 when it came out) i saw it as such a heartbreaking love story when i first saw it, and it is that, but so much more. commentary on social class, mostly, but many other things. every time i see this film, i have a new favorite part. tonight, when it was on tv, i never paid attention to rose and jack's exchange when rose said 'i know what you must be thinking. poor little rich girl. what does she know about misery?', and jack answers 'no. i was wondering what must have happened to this girl to make her think she has no way out'. we don't have this compassion for rich people in 2020 and we should learn it.this movie is perfection on every level and the academy seemed to mostly agree. one of the few films in history you cant argue with them on.",Titanic

The Film tells the story of the Titanic from a different perspective. Leonardo Plays Jack, as poor young man who just managed to get onto the Titanic, and Kate Winslet plays Rose, a rich young lady, whom with Jack does she fall in love DiCaprios acting is fantastic, same goes for Winslet. A lot of people complain about their acting, saying it's cheesy and cheap. Well I have one thing to say to those people, and that is that the acting is Supposed to be cheesy.

503,Sisiutil,Over-rated and over-blown but worth seeing,7,3 January 2002,"When Michael Bay made Pearl Harbor, he must have been watching this film over and over again. He repeated many of its strengths and all of its weaknesses.Both films are modern retakes on unforgettable historical events. Both feature spectacular special effects and appealing, talented actors. And both films are rendered mediocre by the same weaknesses: a hackneyed, cliche-ridden romance plot and the weak, clunky dialogue that accompanies it. Add in a few two-dimensional stock characters to back up our young lovers and you've got the modern Hollywood version of the historical epic. Kurosawa and Lean must be spinning in their graves.Nonetheless, I have to give Cameron some credit. He may not have made a really great film since The Terminator or maybe Aliens, but he's never made a boring one to my knowledge. Titanic entertains in spite of its weaknesses--it moves along at a good clip and is well-photographed. Cameron certainly captures the look of the era.The bulk of the credit for this film's success, however, must got to the two charismatic leads. DiCaprio and especially Winslet do an admirable job with the limited material they're given. The scene that worked best for me was when Rose has to rescue Jack, who's been left handcuffed in a room that's rapidly sinking below the waterline. After trying (unsuccessfully) to get men to help her--the expected course of action for a young woman of her time--Rose grabs and axe and sets out to rescue her lover, swallowing back tears and her uncertainty. We see her, in that moment, taking the first steps towards becoming the bold, confident older woman charmingly portrayed by Gloria Stuart in the modern-day sequences. Cameron's very good at showing female characters finding previously untapped depths of character and strength, and he successfully goes back to that well in Titanic. If only he'd punched up the dialogue and done justice to some of the secondary characters, Titanic could have been a great film. As it is, it's just okay. 7/10--barely.",Titanic
504,VictorianCushionCat,Hyped or Hated,5,19 January 2012,"Looking at all the reviews before mine, it seems that Titanic either is hated or loved to the extreme either way. My verdict is that it's very entertaining as a mindless special effects fest but as a Titanic enthusisast for some years before it's release can find much fault.Firstly it's historically poor, key to this is the scene where Officer Murdoch shoots a passenger then shoots himself, after taking bribe money. My problem here is that this Officer Murdoch actually existed and is it really fair 85 years on to make out that he got up to such business? Another gripe is the script and acting, it's terrible, not least some of the lines between Winslett and De Caprio. Somehow all the actors seem to be too uncomfortable to deliver their lines naturally. Much as I approve of seeing a 1930s era actress in a late 90s blockbuster (Gloria Stuart) I really can't stand her dialogue delivery, I assume they had called Fay Wray first.There are positives, the sinking is exciting enough, in other words good special effects, which seems to be enough for some people. I even rather like the very final scene, where Rose is reunited with all the people on the ship who died, but to call this the best film ever is perhaps going a wee bit too far.Perhaps having seen both 'Titanic 1952' with a very well throughout family tradigy, and the more documentary style 'Night to Remember 1958' I was never going to fall in love with James Cameron's effort, I reckon Kenneth More would of told him where he could stick the line 'I'll shoot you all like dogs' One more moan, 'De Witt Buckator' Most unintentionally awful movie name ever!",Titanic

It will be almost impossible.The director no doubt had the major impact on the film. A simple disaster film (boring to watch) converted to an unbelievable romance. Yes I'm not the Romance type either, but that should not bother you, because you will never see a romance like this. Guaranteed! Everything to the amazing effects, to the music, to the sublime acting. The movie creates an amazing visual and a wonderful feeling. Everything looks very real and live. The legend herself ""TITANIC"" is shown brilliantly in all classes, too looks, too accommodation. The acting was the real effect. Dicaprio and Winslet are simply the best at playing there roles. No one could have done better. They are partly the reason why the film is so great. I guess it's not too much to talk about. The plot is simple, The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, Probably more then half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to un imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. Well if you haven't seen this film your missing out on something Hesterical, and a film to idolise for Hollywood. Could it get better? No. Not at all. The most moving film of all time, don't listen to people, see for yourself then you will understand. A landmark. (don't be surprised if you cry too)",Titanic
506,medic249a2,A masterpiece in historical accuracy as well as screen writing,10,18 June 2007,"When I saw James Cameron's Titanic on its opening day in 1997, I remember overhearing a woman explaining to her 2 daughters, 'The Titanic was a real ship and real people died on it', so they would not become totally caught up in the love story of Jack & Rose. I had first read about the legendary Titanic when I was about 10 years old, but I had no idea just how horrible the real disaster has been until reading Walter Lord's 'A Night to Remember' and seeing the 1959 B & W movie based on that book. When Dr. Robert Ballard found the Titanic's resting place in 1985 the world's interest was re-opened in the story, and Cameron's massive undertaking to retell the story of that fatal night in April 1912 was a success on any scale.I was mostly interested in the historical aspects of the story, and was not disappointed. Cameron's research into the ship's design, the passenger list (especially 1st-class), the costumes, right down to the last detail on the 1st-class china, is minute. It was SO close to the historical accuracy as detailed by Walter Lord (and later by Robert Ballard) that one could have easily believed they were actually there.Cameron's use of a love story featuring people at opposite ends of the spectrum (Rose, the dignified 1st-class girl and Jack, the impoverished steerage passenger) makes for an interesting element in the story. Though the story focused largely on their own experiences I don't think it detracted from the movie's historical accuracy. We often see Rose & Cal Hockley interacting with such real-life passengers as J.J. Astor, Ben Guggenheim, Molly Brown & the Countess of Rothes. It also focused well on Jack's experiences in steerage which were probably similar to those of many steerage-class passengers, who often found themselves trapped below decks in a ship that was rapidly filling with water.Some of the more interesting historical elements were cut & later released on the deluxe DVD edition; one shows Capt. Smith calling for the boats to standby close to the ship and Q.M. Hitchens (in Molly Brown's boat) ignoring the order. Also missing was the well-known scene of Macy's Department Store owners Isidor & Ida Strauss, which showed Mrs. Strauss insisting on remaining with her husband right until the end. (They are seen while 'Nearer My God to Thee' is playing, in their cabin as water rushes in on the floor.) Another missing scene which was understandably cut showed little Cora Caldwell (Jack's dance partner in steerage) and her family trapped by a locked gate with water rising behind them.Jack's ultimate fate was that of most steerage passengers; he died of hypothermia well before the arrival of the only rescue ship. Rose only survived because she managed to improvise a life raft on a floating piece of the Grand Staircase. She could have become one more of the small number of 1st-class women & children who did not survive (the only others were Mrs. Strauss, Mrs. H.J. Allison and her little daughter, Lorraine).Depending on how one wants to see it, this movie is either a grand love story against a backdrop of imminent doom, or a historically accurate movie with a love story as the background. Either way, Jim Cameron's masterpiece will long stand as one of movie history's greatest achievements. It could have been a colossal flop, but because so much planning had gone into it to make it as historically accurate as well as creating a story people would want to follow, it has succeeded beyond even Cameron's expectations. Well done James!",Titanic
507,ElmStreetsLastBrat,A Guilty Pleasure! How can you not love this film?,8,23 March 2007,"Titanic from 1997 is a wonderful movie. It really is. For me it's such a guilty pleasure because even though it's good, it is definitely clichéd and the love story in it is so ridiculous. But how can you not love this film? This movie has everything. Violence, nudity, sex, a love story, romance, disaster and special effects. The story line is pretty simple. It's about the Titanic, the ""unsinkable"", biggest ship in the world, at the time. On the morning of April 15, 1912, it hits an iceberg in the North Atlantic and sinks to the bottom of the ocean in less than three hours. Over 1,000 of the 2,000 passengers on board are killed. Pretty simple, right? Well, to add to the drama, there's a love story involved. Rose DeWitt Bukater, played by Kate Winslet, is a wealthy young heir who is engaged to the handsome and rich but arrogant and controlling Cal Hockley, played by Billy Zane. One night she decides to try and commit suicide by jumping off the boat. A poor loner named Jack Dawson, played by Leonardo DiCaprio, sees what she's about to do and coerces her into aborting her decision. As she's climbing back over the railing, she slips and nearly falls into the icy ocean. Jack grabs her arm and pulls her to safety. But two of the ship's crewmen hear her screaming and come to her aid. They see Jack on top of Rose and think he has done something awful to her. He is about to be punished until Rose convinces Cal, her fiancé, that Jack was only saving her after she slipped while looking at the propellers. And from then on Jack is infatuated with Rose. She has stolen his heart. Even though Jack has no money and no ambitions, Rose can't help but fall equally in love with him. He is sweet and charming. After a sweaty fling in a car at the bottom of the ship, the couple go up on deck and embrace. It is then that they see the iceberg and the ship hits it.The first hour of the film focuses on the budding romance between Jack and Rose. It is somewhat entertaining but for me the real entertaining part of the film was the second half, which focuses on how the ship sank after hitting the iceberg. There are plenty of breathtaking special effects. And of course you have to have a clichéd, out of place scene mixed in with it, including Rose's fiancé Cal shooting a round of bullets at Jack and Rose after seeing the two kiss and hug. But then again it's kind of exciting to watch these scenes because they make you think, oh my god, these events are happening while the ship is sinking! This movie was very sappy at times, but it is still a great film to watch. This movie will make you cry, laugh, and keep you on the edge of your seat all at once. There are moments where you will get bored with the love story but it's worth sitting through to see the carnage of the ship sinking. I'm glad this film was a hit. It is definitely one of the greatest films ever made and it's so hard not to love it!! All the actors did fine jobs. I'm glad I have this movie in my collection. Thanks for reading my review! :) :) :)",Titanic
508,like_cc,true love,8,21 March 2020,"It's a touching love movie.
The movie spent huge sums of money to create a magnificent effect, and the two protagonists perfectly interpreted a seemingly accidental, but destined, touching, great love.
In the film, the heroine's role in rescuing the heroine deeply infected me, and I felt that this is true love.
At the end of the film, the four performers, I also have a feeling of awe. When life is about to pass away, they are still calm and continue to play, even if life is about to leave, they are playing with life! Play the last song of life.",Titanic
509,Herbest8,Does not hold up well twelve years later,3,5 October 2009,"This is, without question, one of the most overblown movies of the last twenty years. This is a romantic retelling of the infamous sinking and who do we have as stars? Two pretty people (Leo and Kate) who will never be compared to Clark and Vivian but nobody's perfect.This is a real hit and miss film. The cons are just huge: the framing story is completely unnecessary, the story is so stilted, and the whole set-up prior to the climax is just boring. Not really helping matters is that the love story seems recycled from a Lifetime TV movie.The pros are minor but save it from complete disaster. The ship sinking climax is very well done and loaded with tension, some of the cast members do very well (a good example being Victor Garber as the kindly Thomas Andrews) but I think special mention should go to David Warner as the cruel valet, Spicer Lovejoy. Warner steals every scene he's in and his death scene at the ship splitting is simply priceless.Although it doesn't hold up particularly well and is certainly no masterpiece, it's OK overall.",Titanic
510,www-jats,The Best Movie Ever????,10,18 January 2010,"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensely, and still do! I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! Give this movie a break you guys! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"". ha! Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more! Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It's not their best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!",Titanic
511,lleeric,Underrated this movie is best movie ever,10,2 June 2010,this movie is the best movie i seen in years. This movie is about 3 hours long and it felt like the movie was only 1 hour. Leonardo DiCaprio did an awesome job in this movie. So as Kate Winslet. James Cameron is the best director ever. This movie made me cry. The very last part is very sad. A very good movie about a titanic ship and about a women's life. All the people who think this is a f*** sh** think again... Cause' If you hate this movie you have no life. Anyways very sad and good movie. This movie is very underrated. It should be in the top 250 list. I recommend this movie highly. Please go see it now! My Rating:10/10,Titanic

513,sierranevadaentertainment,James Cameron,10,26 April 2015,"I can congratulate to James Cameron for the directing the movie of ""Titanic"", I saw the scene was the iceberg hit the ship on the starboard side. I could ask Jim for some surprise for the book on the ship for the pictures was in it. So, I have a book called ""Lusitania: An Illustrated Biography"" by J. Kent Layton with Artwork by Tom Lear. I can ask him for some scriptwriting with it. I could it the name for the movie with 'Hamlet' on the ship. So, that is how it happened and now, I have work to do for my animation. I guess I'll be working harder as I thought. Don't worry, I will be reading for some books for some biography to do for it. Thank you so much.",Titanic
514,Castor-5,"""blah blah blah fake characters... waste of 200 million... Leo sucks... all special effects"" SHUDDUP",10,18 October 1998,"Would you people give it up already?  Half of you haven't even seen the movie but you just like to criticize for no reason just like some of you probably did to Saving Private Ryan. ""Fake characters""  Ok lets think about this... how do you know they are fake?  Kate Winslet's Rose could have been like any rich person on the ship and Leo's character you don't have any record of just like you didn't have records of some of the real people that got on the ship by mugging passengers before they got on it.  So who cares if they are fake?  How dumb of an excuse is that to criticize this movie? ""Waste of 200 million""  yeah yeah right sure, not one of you could have come even close to making this the film it is.  ""Leo sucks""  now you are just full of jealousy and since Leo is an overrated actor (I admit that he is) that since he's in the movie you have to say it's horrible.  Well for those of you who actually think that he is like the same character he is in The Man in the Iron Mask why don't you actually watch this movie because those of you that have said why it sucks is because of Leo have obviously not seen it.  His acting and many others are great in the film, ok maybe not outstanding but nor were the ones in Gone With The Wind, you just make them out to be.  ""All special effects"" yeah ok here are another group of people that didn't see the movie because the special effects don't really kick in into the last half hour of the film is with all those effects that you would actually notice to criticize.  They are throughout the film but they are so clear you don't realize it.  So why don't most of you just give it a rest because none of you have any idea what you are talking about you just figure since Titanic is the biggest film around you should criticize it.  You aren't Siskel and Ebert so no one really cares about your closed-minded opinions.  Some of you may feel it was overrated but just because of that dosen't make it suck.  I don't know one person or have seen one of your reviews that have gave such a real reason to criticize it.  It's only problem was the script and it wasn't a real problem.  So what if it had a few bad lines?  Not every film is written by Quentin Tarantino so you can't expect a Pulp Fiction in every script written.  So just do us all a favor.... either actually go and really watch the movie or SHUDDUP!!!!!",Titanic

516,sheepmonk2000,This film never sinks.,10,5 June 2011,"This film never sinks. From the opening few shots to the final moments of the film, everything about it is simply wonderful. It's majestic, charming, sweet, thrilling, suspenseful and most of all heart wrenching. The pacing of the film is perfect and the special effects towards the end of the film are also top notch. The story is about two young lovers Jack and Rose. It really is a beautiful love story as we see them overcoming the odds in order to be together. But don't be put off by the love story element, as there's plenty of action and excitement come the second half of the film and the film never sinks for one moment. Like I said, the pacing is perfect and I must say this is probably the greatest story telling ever put to celluloid - James Camerons a genius. All the actors/actresses are great, but for me it's Leonardo DiCaprio's movie as his character Jack, demonstrates his self worth at every turn and goes to extraordinary lengths in order for him and Rose to be together and ultimately stay together i.e survive the catastrophe that may fore-go their destinies. To conclude, phenomenal.",Titanic

518,alexsnower,Good but would give 7.5 if possible,7,12 July 2021,"As someone interested in titanic history, I like to see movies based on the event. However, I can't say this is the best movie in terms of acting, CGI or plot development. Kate Winslet whines her way to an average performance. I'm not sure why she was picked to be the lead female. DiCaprio does a good job but not his best work. Billy Zane is also weird casting choice and he isn't exactly great. The best actor/actress performance in the movie is probably Gloria Stewart. The CGI is not good, I know it was early in the game but some of it looks bad for 90's standards. I do like the movie being a wide stream outlet for knowledge on the titanic. However, the breaking of the ship is very inaccurate in the movie. The stern did not settle that high before the structural failure. Otherwise all the water sinking the ship looked nice. The grand staircase was particularly lovely. That scene alone makes this at least a 5.",Titanic
519,mswatsoninc,"The Film That Launched 1,000 2+ Hour Films",7,31 January 2007,"Remember when a film that ran over two hours was a shiny beacon among film that exemplified greatness?

Where does that brilliance come from? Is it the acting?

As much as I hate the fact that I hate this film as much as I do on an intellectual level, I cannot deny that, no matter how many times I've seen that ship sink, I'm always mesmerized each and every time it does. Jim Cameron has indeed gone out of his way to stupefy us with his ending...and I bought it hook, line, and sinker.Although it took us almost two hours of banal dialogue to get there, the ending is absolutely spectacular in its delivery.

521,Colonel Ted,A wonderfully romantic epic,10,19 February 2000,"Banal, crass, slushy, unoriginal, expensive, only won 11 Oscars as a `thank you' because if it had flopped the entire Hollywood studio system would have collapsed etc etc Yes all of these charges were and still are being laid against James Cameron's hugely expensive, multi Oscar winning epic. Times (and critics for that matter) never change because that is exactly the sort of thing people were saying back in the 50s and 60s with epics like Ben-Hur and look were they are in the cinema cannon. Having said that it is ironic then, Titanic is the sort of film people say they don't make anymore. It is true that some of Cameron's dialogue is not exactly Shakespeare, but everything else in the film more than makes up for it. DiCaprio and Winslet are perfect as the lovers crossing the class divide and bland lines aside Cameron's story is cleverly structured in developing the love story. From the dinner scene as Wisconsin boy DiCaprio holds his own against the snobs he's sitting with, to the detailing of the sinking itself. Cameron as director triumphs totally. At three hours long, the film feels more like 90 minutes, the recreation of the Titanic, both afloat and going under is brilliant, spectacular and thrilling. Cameron coaxes superb performances from his cast, with Zane the stand out among the supporting players as a nicely nasty villain and James Horner's beautiful music score enhances the mood of the film perfectly. Titanic hits all the emotional targets with more inspiration that is common among today's big budget films and the amount of effort that has gone into it, from the acting and not just the production is there for all to see. Even if you hated it, you can't deny that £200 million was up the on the screen.",Titanic

According to records of the sinking, some survivors in the waters lived for up to 15 minutes before freezing to death, not the 3 minutes you claim. And you actually think the dialogue is worthy of a kindergarden movie?? Give me a break. You can honestly say that the script didnt make you laugh or get a watery eye at least once?? You ripped this movie to shreds for no good reason. You based your opinions on nothing but untruths.

523,hitchs,Perfection,10,25 September 2000,"James Cameron had already, through such classics as The Terminator and Aliens, proved himself to be the world's greatest film-maker, but from the first bars of James Horner's beautiful and haunting sound track, I began to realize that this one surpassed even those masterpieces.The movie's biggest problem is its popularity, because so many people try to shoot at something when it gets too big.Almost everything about Titanic is perfect. No one could call DiCaprio and Winslet great actors (witness Leo's appalling performance in The Man in the Iron Mask), but they, like Stuart, Zane, Paxton and a host of minor players, are perfectly suited to their roles. The script, despite failing to get even an Oscar nomination, is brilliant. The direction is sublime. The cinematography, visual and sound effects are unequalled.The attention to detail is mind-boggling, despite the enormous effort exerted by some to find errors. But for me, what makes Titanic shine above every other motion picture I have ever seen is the unforgettable portrayal of the ravages of time.Many people have commented on the famous `poster shot' of Jack and Rose at the bow of the ship, but what makes the scene especially memorable is the end, where the beautifully painted ship dissolves flawlessly into the present-day rusting hulk at the bottom of the Atlantic. This and similar dissolves are, for me, the essence of what film-making can achieve, the one thing movies can do so much better than the written word, the classic demonstration that pictures  especially moving pictures  can achieve more than thousands of words.Finally, the ending clinches everything. Endings have long been Cameron's biggest problem - especially the awful pseudo-Spielberg ending of The Abyss - but here he got it absolutely right. After showing us so convincingly how easily nature and time can crush human vanity and technological achievement, it is the human spirit which finally triumphs over all.",Titanic

It would probably have simply made four or five hundred million dollars, people would have shrugged it off as simply a more than usually expensive mainstream blockbuster, it would still have taken home several technical Oscars, L.A. Confidential would have won Best Picture, and life would have gone on.But it didn't happen like that. Instead, James Cameron made an monumental commercial gamble in putting together a story of love and tragedy across the decades the likes and scale of which audiences had never seen before, and likely never will again. He was rewarded with a mountain of Oscars and the distinction of having made the first movie to a cap one billion dollars in worldwide gross.Naturally, a huge wave of people sprung up swearing up and down that the film was unworthy of this level of success. I'm sure you know the sort; they lay into Titanic, calling it the lowest of dreck and that there's not a single redeeming point in it and that its success came solely from 14-year old girls.

531,Hairy_Lime,Not all that bad....,7,22 January 2004,"This seems to be one of the movies that people either loath or adore.  The first time I saw it, I marveled at the technical display but found the main plot curiously uninvolving.  This is despite a good performance by Kate Winslett and DiCaprio as well - he has been very good in roles before he became a superstar, and he will again.  As good as they were, I just did not believe in their story. But in fact, even though the romance between Jack and Rose feels false and anachronistic to me, I have come to appreciate, if nothing else, the importance of having that type of story to command our attention while the SPOILER ALERT boat sinks.  If you have the chance to watch Night to Remember, you'll see what I mean; the last half of that movie seems to be nothing more than men nobly rfusing to get on lifeboats and women weepingly not wanting to leave them.  Rose and Jack at least give us something to concentrate on while the thing is going down.So, give this a 4 of 5 primarily for the technical aspects, and also for answering the question, whatever happened to the guy who played Jesus in Godspell.  Answer: he's building boats even God cannot sink.",Titanic
532,MovieFanGuyy,James Cameron's 1997 Titanic is easily the most overrated film in history!,1,4 June 2007,"Titanic, which is currently the biggest film of all time, (Why? is the biggest question of them all!) definitely has divided moviegoers in the last decade since it's release. Many women feel it is one of their favorite films of all time with great special effects, and a lead that they can relate to. Most men on the other hand, obviously feel very differently than women do about this film.Many others, like myself, easily feel that James Cameron's Titanic is easily the most overrated film in history with bloated, cheesy and banal dialoge, two dull lead characters, and a storyline which cheapens the tragedy of the sunken ship.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet play the star crossed lovers aboard the doomed ship, while a supporting cast with Billy Zane, Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, and Bernard Hill do their best in trying to keep the screenplay and Cameron's bloated dialoge from falling out of place.The visual effects, which looked decent at the time has not held up well, there is a lot of pixelation of the ship itself, and the crash sequence today looks like something out of a playstation video game.The dialoge also today does not hold up well, and many sequences such as Rose holding up a middle finger does not support believability in the least. Secondly, while the two leads are treading frozen water, both of them would have died from hypothemia long before the ship itself sank to the bottom.Third, Rose's character would have died even quicker floating on top of the piece of wood since the ocean wind is actually much colder than the water itself, not to mention the water on her body would have also caused hypothemia as well. Why her character was one of the few survivors is a puzzlement to credability of this film itself.This film will continue to divide moviegoers for many years, with many of it's fans liking it, and those who despise and hate Titanic, will also continue to do so.James Cameron had a great opportunity to explore the legacy of the famed sunken ship, but instead by focusing on a teenage romance, with banal dialoge, and two wooden leads, it definitely kills not only the storyline, but the credability of this film as well.In my opinion, Titanic does not hold up well to stand the test of time, and that is why it's easily the most overrated film in history in my opinion. His last great film was 1991's T2, as both True Lies and Titanic contained much of Cameron's famously banal dialoge and bloated budgets.",Titanic

When the ship sailed, I felt that I boarded along with it. Jack and Rose shared a genuine love that even though it lasted only a few days, it felt like a lifetime. Until the moment it hits the iceberg, the emotions and the agony is felt. The sadness and sorrow was shown in such a profound way. The ending was very sad; however, as the dream sequence ended the film, Titanic will forever live on and its passengers too. A great and authentic film.",Titanic

I didn't really read any review that said it was awful, but now that is all people say. When it came out in 1997 everyone was talking about this film, it brought them to tears, the end scene shocked them, the love story made them feel warm. Now whenever anyone talks Titanic it is one of the worst films they've seen. Did I watch a completely different film, the acting was good, the computer generated images were amazing, the attention to detail was overwhelming. The script is the only thing that lets it down and there are worse out there. I found the whole thing to be very moving and if it was such a bad script it would make you cringe not cry.The people who call Titanic the worst film, obviously cried and are covering up for the fact it was one of the only films they cried at.I personally really like Titanic I think it's a very watchable experience that does leave you stunned if not tear stained. It is one of the only three hour films I can watch over again.",Titanic
539,johnfos,Much ado about a sinking ship,5,19 June 2005,"As we all know Titanic won Best Picture and Best Director, and 9 other Oscars in 1997, out of 14 nominations -- quite an achievement. This equalled the all-time record total of 11 Academy Awards also held by Ben Hur (1959) and The Return of the King (2003). And yet Titanic has also received a mention on several worst movie lists. In 2003, for example, as part of a BBC listener's poll, one person said: ""My father fell asleep after 20 minutes. He was lucky. It was only his snoring that kept me awake.""Seriously though, I was disappointed with Titanic. In my humble opinion it was too long, with too many special effects, and a story that became fragmented because it was crosscut with another.Having a look at The Academy's Best Picture winners over the years, there are several films which I think could be described as ""epics"" which haven't quite made the grade. These films seem to go on for as long as they possibly can, incorporate the largest cast of extras possible, and usually have several or more special sequences. Unfortunately, I see Titanic as one of these films.Other epics which have won Best Picture, and which have left me rather disappointed, are Gandhi, Amadeus, The Last Emperor, Out of Africa, and Gladiator.",Titanic
540,Movie Hound Video,Exceptional music and movie,10,28 January 2007,"As a married man in his early 40's, I must say I have seen this movie at least 6 times before today. I had the chance to enjoy this movie with my wife and two teen boys (their first time). I am so glad they could appreciate the romance of the movie as well as deal with the length of the movie. Both of my boys have loved the music since it was released, but never watched the film because of the chic flick image. It made me proud that they could appreciate such a film. I agree that Kate Winslet deserved an Oscar for her performance which seems the majority of opinion. James Horner's music is considered one of the greatest soundtrack's of all time and rightfully so. I just saw the deleted/extended scenes from the 2005 DVD and they were great. The commentary is dry at times, but I recommend that you give it a chance if you can.",Titanic
541,Norway1,Beauty with the standard Hollywood flaws:,8,24 June 1999,"This was a brilliantly filmed movie and deserved many of its awards. I was however disappointed by two or three scenes, specifically (1) the ridiculous spitting lessons, (2) the portrait scene, (3) and especially the sex-in-the-car scene. It's sad that so many of Hollywood's producers feel the need to force totally unnecessary scenes such as these (not to mention Rose's ""finger"" scene) into a movie just to try to ""appease"" the public with the sex and worldly innuendos they think we want to see - regardless of whether it distracts us completely from the story at hand.With that said I must add that overall I really enjoyed the film as a whole. It's pluses easily outweigh the minuses.The most notable points I appreciated were (1) the fabulous score! (2) the amazing special effects, (3) the beautiful costumes, (4) the editing, (5) the lighting and colors in general, and finally (6) the casting for the main roles: Leonardo has got incredible charisma, Winslet is just a fantastic actress (loved her in Hamlet) and Billy Zane is always cool!I give it 8½ out of 10.",Titanic

If the story (beautiful-rich-next-to-marry-rich-b****rd-girl meets young-handsome-pure-and-intelligent-guy)is already known, Cameron shows us how cinema can reconstruct the real world. Years of study on the original projects of the ship, a perfect research from the structure of the ship until the resemblance of the actors with the real persons (Bernard Hill and Victor Garber are the clearest examples), all is made by Cameron to take us on the ""Titanic"": we taste the beauty of the ship, the elegance of the rich people and the dreams of the poor ones.

The story in its broadest outline is a sure winner. But where is the genuine feeling for its period? Characters are made to act as a modern audience might think they would have done in the early part of the last century. Without a sense of period this version could never be a truly great film. It also suffers from utilising stereotypes excessively, from a hostility to the Edwardian upper classes from both America and Britain, and also a poor choice of actor in some of the key roles. The relationship between the two principal characters is also highly improbable in that era - and Rose DeWitt Bukater's slutish behaviour highly unlikely not to mention reprehensible, for a supposedly well- brought up girl.",Titanic

For all the awards this trash did win, nobody with any clout gave the actors anything. Leo didn't even get a nomination! The ship sank, and people died because a big company traded lives for profit.

548,forrestwrs,Titanic--Disaster of Dreams,8,29 May 2007,"There is a lot of obvious hype associated with this film. Let's just face it, though, the main reasons why anyone would watch it would be for Leo and Cate, who are not necessarily the best actors in this film. I'm not saying they're not good actors, I'm saying they stunk in this film. The special effects were decent (and I will say the film makers did a good job making the ship eye-pleasing), but IT even has several major flaws. For instance, right before the ship goes under, you can see an unfinished blue-screen image behind your main characters.Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the story of the REAL Titanic, but I find this movie an insult to that story. Editing was atrocious--there's no reason for any film to be over 2 1/2 hours (with the exception of MAYBE a biographical movie), and the writing and screenplay was horribly stilted.I will say that the music was perhaps better than I could have predicted (and not just the ""My Heart Will Go On"" song either). There is one scene that stands out to me when the ship is sinking and pounding bass music is heard. That could very well be the highlight of the film. As for the mood throughout, it was extremely dull. I was more relieved than sad when Jack died, which I know cannot be what the director intended.In a nut shell, I find it horrible that they turned the beautiful story of the Titanic into an over-hyped chick flick.",Titanic
549,Progressive-Element,Impressive enough to make up for flaws,8,25 May 2013,"James Cameron takes budget-busting to a new level for his bold, ambitious attempt to create a film set around the titular ship's doomed voyage.It becomes clear after awhile there's only one 'character' the director is really interested in - the Titanic. And what an impressive job he's done at recreating the sights of what was then the world's largest ship. Truly a loving ode to the tragic White Star liner.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are just likable enough as lovers from different social states, that one can almost stomach the schmaltzy slushy moments of the film, not to mention some pretty weak dialogue. Certainly Kate makes us guys like her a lot more when she doffs her clothes...The rest of the cast are good enough but tend to boil down into one-dimensional stereotypes, including the ones playing real people. Billy Zane on the other hand, while perfectly hissable, is only missing a moustache he could twirl. 'Mwahahaha, you are marrying me pretty, mwahahaha.' When the ship finally hits the damn iceberg after about 90 minutes have passed, we get to the best part of the film. The sinking provides moments as tense as the Terminator stalking Sarah and Kyle in the computer factory, and Ripley making her way through an alien nest in her search for Newt. It is in this segment we see the relentlessness James Cameron often puts into action set-pieces. At first, there's slow-build tension with the ship slowly taking on water, before it drives the film into full-blown panic. The later scene of floating frozen bodies perhaps does more to convey the true horror of the sinking than the actual effects work.All of this is told in flashback by a much older Rose to a treasure-hunter and his team searching for a diamond. These are actually the weakest moments in the film, and often detract from the tone of the 1912 scenes. Gloria Stuart's narration pushes the film further into schmaltz overload, but that's nothing compared to an ending, recently voted as the corniest scene ever put on film.One factor that helps absorb you into the viewing experience, and just stops you from vomiting, is James Horner's sweeping score. Fortunately, we don't hear Celine Dion until the end credits.For all it's flaws, it still works on the level of a grand old-fashioned epic.",Titanic
550,numenorsniper-66396,One of the best,10,12 December 2020,"I have watched Titanic dozens if not hundreds of times since I first got it on VHS as a kid in the 90s. I hadn't watched it for many years until the past few days when I watched it a few times in a row, and really appreciated it on a deeper level I felt, or maybe just remembered how truly great it is.Sure it has its cinematic flaws, such as seeing waves lapping at the shoreline next to the set when it should be the Titanic in the middle of the ocean.
But then again all films have their little quirks and errors scattered throughout. Despite those found in Titanic, the emotion that the film makes me feel is unmatched by any other movie. It is pure magic from start to finish, many times throughout the film my eyes well up with tears, or outright balling.It's one of the few movies that I would pay good money to see again in a massive full theatre.I really don't know why it's not in the IMDb top 250, when many films on the list are trash in comparison to Titanic, in my opinion.Titanic is in my Top 10 of all time, alongside Lord of the Rings, Hero, Kimi No Na Wa, Princess Mononoke, and Lonesome Dove, and others.",Titanic

556,Blinking_Fish,Very good film even if you don't like love stories,10,2 August 1998,"Titanic was great.  I originally saw the previews and thought ""O.k. this movie looks cool when the ship is sinking and the guy is shooting at Kate and Leo.  Aside from that it looks like another soppy love story.  I'll watch it anyways.""  So I sat in the theater and my view changed.  Sure it had a love story but the effects where great.  For the entire movie you get wonderful shots of the Titanic the real one and the movie set one, you get to see Kate topless and half the movie is the ship sinking.  Some of the shots are slightly like previous Cameron films.  For example Shots of the Titanic slowly changing from how it looked like then to how it looks like now.  Sort of like the scene in T2 where the playground in the present time slowly changes into the burning play ground of the future.  Anyways back to Titanic.  The sinking of the ship is done very well.  You get to see people bouncing of the bars and other parts of the ship and jumping for their life as the ship goes down.  Anyways if you want to give this movie a chance on September 1st 1998 Give 3 hours of your life to watching a film and rent Titanic (Try to get in letterbox format).",Titanic
557,PureCinema,The worst film to ever win a best picture Oscar,3,28 January 1999,"Checking out the other comments, one caught my eye... somebody had the gall to make a comparison between this film and Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, ""The Seven Samurai"". To compare this film with ""The Seven Samurai"" is utterly rediculous and an insult to great films. With that said, I'll continue...Let me start off with the absolute horrid screenplay that is filled with cliches. While watching this film, you can pretty much tell what is going to happen next... it's the ""Rich girl forced to marry a rich guy, but she finds a poor boy that she eventually falls in love with"" story you've seen hundereds of times before.... add a big boat, a historical disaster, and bingo, you have yourself a movie. The dialogue is almost laughably bad (""Oh Jack.... Jack!""). And the characters are almost as cliche-ridden as the story they're in. As you watch the film, you feel almost as if you're forced to like the characters.A disaster as huge as the sinking of the Titanic doesn't deserve a film like this. It is an insult to the hundreds that died in that distaster to be represented in a stereotypical film such as this. And it's winning of the best picture oscar is absolute proof that the Oscars are nothing more than a huge popularity contest anymore. To even place this in the same category with films like ""On the Waterfront"", ""Ben-Hur"", ""The African Queen"", ""Rebecca"", ""The Godfather"", etc. is such a shame, and just shows you what direction the film industry is headed.About the only good thing I could say about this film is that it is an enormous technical achievement.

While Gloria Stuart is very touching as old Rose (She was robbed at the Oscars by Kim Basinger...Grrrr!)While the movie is more than 3 hours long, it never feels like it, you experince total awe as James Cameron whisks you back in time allowing you to explore the worlds most famous liner in PERFECT detail.

The ship itself, of course, is gorgeous and the score is excellent. Leonardo DiCaprio, who never had impressed me much before, was quite good, but not nearly as good as Kate Winslet, who I feel deserved the Best Actress Oscar (although I love Helen Hunt dearly). Victor Garber, who played the builder/designer of the Titanic, is excellent, although under-used and under-appreciated. Gloria Stuart is great in her supporting role, but not as good as the incredible Kathy Bates as the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, my favorite character. The direction by James Cameron is incredible, especially during the actual sinking of the Titanic (which is incredibly moving and well done).

I mean I'm a guy and I'm not ashamed to say Titanic moved me to tears and is one of my favourite movies. There is a reason why it won Best Picture at the Oscars as well as many other rewards. It takes the tragic story of Titanic and mixes with a classic love story as well as adventure and some horror and turns it into a film that is so beautiful to look at. Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater make such a wonderful and beautiful couple and act their parts perfectly. The movie is also brilliantly directed by one of my favourite directors, James Cameron and this is up there with his other masterpieces like Avatar, Terminator 2 and Aliens. Not to mention the music matches well with the movie thanks to the work of James Horner's score especially with the love scenes. But even a movie as sad and tragic has a happy ending. Like I know people didn't like how it ending or thought it was confusing but I mean it actually that old Rose died in her sleep and she's with everyone who died on the Titanic, including Jack of course. So in conclusion, if you've never seen Titanic and you like movies, prepare to have a new favourite movie.",Titanic

565,OldRose,Gloria Stuart's role makes the film what it is !,10,8 January 1999,"Director James Cameron reportedly said he wanted a Hollywood veteran to play the role of Old Rose, whose character is aged 102 and a still-living survivor of the Titanic at the time of an undersea search.  And a veteran he found in Gloria Stuart, Hollywood star of the 1930s and 1940s, and 87 years of age when the film was shot.  Old Rose slowly tells her story and spins her way into the hearts of millions on every continent where this film has played.  Eleven Oscars this film took home among fourteen nominations garnered (and most were deserved), but the greatest among the three missing statues on Oscar night was Gloria Stuart's.  Without her this film was an f/x extravaganza with a serious lack of credibility.  Di Caprio and Winslet simply aren't Clark Gable & Vivian Leigh and probably won't grow up to approach anywhere even close to the likes of them, either.  Nevertheless, Cameron wanted a film that the world would remember and he got one -- that ship was as real as anything yet created out of thin air.  Loudest applause for him and the massive crew that made this film possible, and for Gloria Stuart who made the story credible.  Top rating (5 stars of 5) !",Titanic
566,Adam E,One of the best movies ever made!,10,14 January 1999,"All the people who hate ""Titanic"" either must've missed it in the theatres or just hate Leonardo DiCaprio. Sure, he's over-hyped, but people forget how much of an awesome actor he is, see any of his older movies (esp. ""Basketball Diaries"" or ""Gilbert Grape"") to see how amazing of an actor he is. He does an awesome job in this movie, though I more imagined Christian Bale in his part. Gloria Stuart, Kate Winslet and Billy Zane are fantastic as well. Seeing this in theatres was the best theatre experience since ""Star Wars."" I even saw the movie 3 times. On video however, it lacks the oomph that the theatre left you, but it still looks and sounds incredible (get the Widescreen version). Director James Cameron perfectly caught the Titanic wreck and this is one of the most visually stunning and captivating films I've ever seen. Sure, some of the dialogue is weak, but who cares. This film impressed me and I'll never forget it. I still watch this movie from time to time.",Titanic
567,claybo76,Could have been better.,6,31 December 1998,"I have to admit that the sinking of Titanic is done extremely well.  It is terrifying to watch, and probably the closest to the real thing we will ever see.  Amazing special effects as well as realistic direction of all the extras.  You could see that every person aboard was scared.  It was very clever to show us earlier in the film how the Titanic sank, from the computerised sinking shown to old Rose, so you knew it would break in half, and how it would go down, etc.  I felt that added another sense of tension.The love story that underlined the movie was what disappointed me.  This kind of terrible scripting and love-you-till-the-end-of-time encounters is now seeping into other movies, eg: Armageddon.  Does anybody honestly think a 'proper' girl in 1912 would indulge in spitting lessons?  Or pull the finger at Hockley's 'henchman' whilst going down the elevator?  Or make love in the back of a car with someone she has only known since being aboard the Titanic?The sketching scene is the only love scene needed.  It is showing us that Rose is starting to come out of her shell and rebel, although it is a private moment.  There is an unspoken intimacy between Rose and Jack that is beautiful, and expresses their love for each other better than a hand pressing against a steam covered car window.  I'm sure that scene made many a man wish he could draw his girlfriend/fiancee/wife.On the whole, parts of the film make me twinge, that bloody song, f'rinstance.  As well as blatantly obvious computer generated shots and terrible scripting (notice it didn't get a nomination for Best Original Screenplay? - it has been years since a film that won Best Film was nominated for that award). The effects are brilliant, along with the editing and the action sequences.",Titanic
568,Mephisto-24,"Three hours of movie, three minutes of plot.",5,11 July 2001,"A $200m+ budget, 2000+ passengers on the Titanic, 3 hours plus of film, and what do we get for it? Two - count 'em, two! - fictitious stock romantic characters (three if you're feeling generous and count Cal), plus a few walk-ons. Even the Titanic itself isn't much more than an extra; another writer/director could have told the same story on a real ship in half the time at a hundredth of the cost. It's all told as a flash-back, so there are no surprises in the 'plot', and I spent most of the last twenty minutes muttering, ""Just hurry up and die, will you?""I'm not saying it's a bad film; it's merely overlong and overrated. There are some very good moments, especially after the Titanic begins sinking and we get to meet some other characters: good special effects, generally good performances (I particularly liked David Warner), a good musical score, and wonderful sets. I suspect, though, that eventually someone will make a tighter, more interesting film set on the Titanic, and this one will sink without trace.",Titanic

571,wrvisser-leusden-nl,a guaranteed setting,8,11 March 2004,"The setting of this movie against the tragic 1912-disaster cannot possibly go wrong: technological advance meets disaster, caused by human arrogance leading to overconfidence.Given this background, the flashback in Titanic's storyline really is a great choice. It allows us to be taken back from our times to 1912, making it easier to identify with Jack Dawson, Rose de Witt Bukater, and all other characters.I only think the goodbye-scene between Jack and Rose, together in the icy Atlantic after the ship is gone, too much. Overdone and therefore boring. However, this flaw is corrected soon enough by showing us Rose back in 1997. Standing at the stern of the salvage ship, she plunges her invaluable necklace right into the sea. Meant as a tribute to her long-lost lover, and also as a moral correction on the greed of the people surrounding her.So much for Titanic's story. It is supported by truly magnificent pictures, alltogether making this a truly great movie.",Titanic
572,ikizdevran-882-254684,Nothing on Earth Could Come Between Them.,9,1 July 2018,"Titanic, the largest moving object of her time hit an iceberg and sank on her maiden voyage leaving untold stories behind. When she was found on the ocean floor she was still facing west. The china have never been used, the sheets have never been slept in. Titanic was called the ship of dreams. It set sail on 10 April 1912 from Southampton and sank on 14 April 1912 hitting an iceberg. James Cameron took an interest in this story because of his passion for shipwrecks. He calls Titanic as ""Mount Everest of shipwrecks."" In the film, treasure hunter Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton) shares the very same passion for a different reason. He is searching for a priceless diamond called ""Heart of the Ocean"" in the wreck of Titanic. During this search he discovers a drawing of a young woman wearing nothing but that diamond. This woman turns out to be still alive at the age of 101 and has a different story to tell about the ill-fated ship.Back in its time Titanic was the most expensive film that has ever been made. Its budget was estimated $200 million. It grossed worldwide $1.84 billion which made Titanic the first film to hit billion-dollar mark. We all know how the film is going to end and yet again we watch. Even more important, James Cameron convinces the production company to invest $200 Million in a film which is about a ship that is going to sink and a sequel is not even possible. One logical explanation to all this madness is, he really believed in Titanic and his own talents as a director, writer and producer. Of course, I haven't forgotten his high-rated films like The Terminator, The Terminator II, Aliens and The Abyss. All those films were a great reference for Titanic, but I believe with a possible failure, his career would have ended forever. He took the risk and it worked. Faith in Titanic made him the king of the world. He is still one of the most successful directors of all time. Titanic won 11 Oscars out of 14 nominations making it the film with the most Oscars won by a single film.James Cameron used latest cinema technology to make Titanic. He even waited for years for this film to be possible. But the story he is telling is a simple one. It is a love story between two people from different social classes. What makes this classic drama a special one is that it is happening in a ship which is going to sink and a lot of people will die including the boy. He wanted his audience to really feel what it was really like to be on Titanic. He took a turn from the story and showed us some powerful scenes to reflect that tragedy to its limits. This is one of the strongest points of Titanic. In 195 minutes, audience feels every human emotion possible. In the film, James Cameron uses the power of soundtracks, intelligent conversations and non-verbal scenes to bring us where he wants us to be.The love between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) happens within four days but echoes to the eternity. This is why one of the taglines of the film is ""Nothing on Earth Could Come Between Them."" You can still see the love and passion in the eyes of old Rose while telling her story after 84 years like it happened yesterday. In this point of view the transmission of all the emotions through Rose to the audience is another strong point of the film. It makes people believe and show sympathy in her story. This makes sinking the ship even harder but it must happen. Drama is the main genre of Titanic. After drama it comes romance because there is a great love, acting and chemistry between Rose and Jack. These extraordinary performances helped Titanic become one of the greatest films of cinema history. The success of the film opened the way to stardom both for Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio.While knitting his story inch by inch, James Cameron takes a moment to point out how rotten our society is with its gaps between social classes. In the night of the accident 1503 recorded passengers lost their lives. This number could have been much less if the lifeboats would have been filled up to its limits. It is shown that some of the lifeboats sailed with little people because the comfort of first-class people was still a priority.Showing real scenes from the Titanic and combining them with the film was brilliant. I have also enjoyed the shooting of the iconic scene where Jack holds Rose from behind at the edge of the ship opening their hands. We see them from different camera angles. If you pay attention there are quite a few scenes that gave the audience goosebumps and this is only possible with a good cinematography. So here is a special thanks to Russell Carpenter.Casting to the soundtracks, Titanic is a work of passion. It is one of the few films that combines a real story with a work of fiction in an artistic way. Films like this can be made but they can't be made perfect. James Cameron managed to make it perfect.",Titanic

I have seen it, but I saw it at a company preview, and I work at a video store, so free videos. Now, don't get me wrong I enjoyed the movie, but the hype that went on over it and the out pour of praise for Leonardo DiCaprio, from fans that came out of the wood work, who really didn't appreciate Leo's previous and better work, such as This Boy's Life and The Basketball Diaries, now they were good movies.Everyone was urged to see this movie, it was almost uncool not to have seen. If someone had asked you if you had seen it and you answered no, they thought you were crazy. Well I decided to make a stand against it. This movie was pure Hollywood, no real story, it was pretty obvious what was going to happen with the love story, and I can't believe it made so much money, I mean everyone knew the ending............It sank.If you are to watch it, make sure you watch an original copy with surround sound, or better yet see it on DVD.

Even though i am a boy, i balled my eyes out at the end of this movie. It was a wonder to see in the movie theater, and is just as good with it's 3 disc, digitally enhanced DVD collection, which i own. So, if u have not seen this film, i HIGHLY advise you to do so.

I found this film has the most depressing scenes ever: A grand ship sinking forever, many people freezing in the water, Jack giving young Rose a sad pep talk, Rose letting go of Jack, seeing all the floating corpses, Old Rose in bed surrounded by her beloved pictures, and the final meeting with her lover Jack and all the Titanic passengers in the final dream-like sequence.

His fancy new Panther tank, in a Meisterstück of environmentally sound engineering, has come with a two live zebra painfully welded to the rear and, as we know, Germans don't do back wheel drive. Vorsprung Durk Technic.A similar, and no less surreal, problem plagues James Cameron's technical tour de force. It is impressive, groundbreaking and sophisticated but, let's face it, it's going nowhere with a plot like that bolted incongruously to its chassis.Renowned to be one of the most expensive films of all time; it seems preposterous that a few quid couldn't have been siphoned from the ""huge-ship-sinks-dramatically"" budget into the ""story"" budget. But there you go.The actors try their best. Plaudits go Leonardo DiCaprio for successfully rehashing Hollywood's cheesy Iorish stereotypes. Billy Zane is excellent as the ""creepy, violent one"". And, of course, our Kate furthers the plot significantly by putting her famous waps on display (they are very impressive).In fact the plot is so bad, and the dialogue so awful, you can sense the huge directorial sigh of relief when the ship starts to sink. Listen carefully and you can almost hear Cameron mutter over tortured screech of ice on metal, ""Ah! This is the kinda film I understand."" Once the ship goes belly-up things do, indeed, liven up dramatically. Things slide around, people scream, chandeliers crash, vast imponderable drops open beneath peoples' legs and the huge, hulking edifice that is James Cameron's Titanic sinks gracefully and inexorably into the dark waters.At least an hour and forty minutes before all this, Winslet provides one of the more amusing, unintentional ironies of the film, when she declares to the ship's designer ""Mr Freud has some interesting theories about men forever striving to make things bigger"". Biggest ship, biggest movie, biggest budget. Hmmm, save it for Oprah.So impressive, expensive, huge and groundbreaking.

When Rose meets Jack an unlikely romance blossoms as the Titanic embarks on it's ill fated maiden voyage.
Cameron truly put in a lot of hard work to create an absolute masterpiece here. Yes the movie has flaws but what movie doesn't? I love how he made what could of been a dreary and gloomy drag of a movie and turned it into quite an up beat story (up until Titanic strikes the ice berg). This is in my favourites.

I am very interested in what happened that night and so imagine my surprise when I watched this film to see Rose spitting over the side of the ship and being very friendly with someone from Third Class when she was travelling First. What was going through peoples minds as they wrote this? This would never happen at that period!! For those of you who are interested in what happened and not just Leo these books have been bought for me and are a big must: Titanic by Leo Marriott, The Riddle of the Titanic by Robin Gardiner & Dan Van Der Vat & Titanic Survivor The memoirs of Violet Jessop Stewardess introduced, edited & annotated by John Maxtone-Graham. The first have the most amazing pictures, the second lists the survivors (and not just First Class as this film would suggest) and the third are the words of someone who was there that night. Unlike this film it tells you what happened and the courage and bravery of those people, not a person who is a hero in Scotland killing himself and definitely not locking the Third Class up until the last minute.

The story of the fatal April 1912 voyage of the quote-unquote ""unsinkable"" Titanic is told here with mastery and real present time footage. The beginning of the film is narrated by Gloria Stuart (playing the part of old Rose with superb detail and presence). She tells a Titanic recovery team about her experience on the ship on that night. After that is when the movie officially begins.Titanic helped launch the career's of its two main stars: Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) is a poor English boy traveling across to the United States, mostly for the thrill of the ship, but also to be able to earn some money. Rose Bukater (Winslet) is a rich English girl who is only on the Titanic because her mother and father are traveling to America. Dawson and Bukater meet on the bow of the ship and are together throughout the film until the very end.It's hard to write a review for a movie that simply can not be described in words. The movie may just seem like a typical love story with a major trap, but it is so much more. James Cameron is truly the best director around. To be able to tell a simple story with such a masterful presence like this is remarkable. The movie will get you emotionally involved (at least it did for me).

I saw most of it, and couldn't sit through the rest.You see, I have a great interest in the *real* Titanic. And I truly believe that this three-hour 'epic' is the greatest insult to the tragedy ever to be put on film. It has nothing to do with the ship, or what really happened. The story would have been more realistic set in some city! As it is the ship is just pushed into the background of a love story that could never, and I repeat never, have happened in true life. Rose would never even have met Jack, and most likely she would not have wanted to! Steerage passengers on the Titanic, and all other ocean liners of the time, were strictly prohibited from association with the other classes, and first class held themselves so aloof that they did not even look on second class, let alone steerage, as human beings let alone material for lovers. Rose would have been raised with these attitudes; they would have been engraved in her no matter how 'free-spirited' she was! And what are the chances that a noblewoman, who has likely never done a lick of work in her life, could ever swing an axe without chopping off someone's hand? Nil.This movie is nothing but Hollywood capitalising on a tragedy that cost hundreds of lives. The only really fitting tribute to the doomed liner is Titanic the musical, which has done it's research and is a triumphant tribute to the ship and the world she sailed in, in which the characters become secondary and the doomed liner takes on a life of it's own.",Titanic

It's a real treat to be able to watch, the theme of the film is self explanatory; however there is so much to it. Regardless whether the love story is true or not, it doesn't matter because without this it would not be as emotionally galvanising as it is. It's astounding.

But I felt a ""One"" vote was deserved here for the overratedness of this movie by box-office and awards. I think the Oscars should be embarrassed this won all those Oscars, including Best Picture. As another commenter pointed out, it is funny that such a bloated film won ""Best Editing"". Honestly, this winning Best Picture would be like ""Ghost"" winning that award: a popular, sappy movie with pretty leads.. Only this lacks the actually humorous Whoopi...The ""romance"" is laughable. I like Winslet. She has at least tried to steer clear of this type of stuff since. Actually, mostly, so has DeCrapio...Malcolm X and Gandhi's lives: those are worthy of three hours(plus) of film..NOT this ""eternal romance""..Some people are simply impressed by the sinking. I'm sorry, but if there isn't one person on the ship I care about, the sinking does not mean much to me. Spectacle? Try nature. Go watch a volcano...BTW, I will say I think it is hilarious that people refer to Winslet as a ""cow"" in this because she isn't an anorexic actress. I honestly initially was perplexed whom they were even referring to, because Bates isn't even all that fat. Like they wouldn't want Kate as their girlfriend? Come on...I would certainly never want to see this one again...The script fails to portray an ""eternal love"". Rather it gives us a bit of lust.

The script is too long, dialogues a little cheesy, screenplay a tad slow, but the whole package together is so beautiful that you end up falling in love with the movie. Bottom line, I'm no one to talk about this man.Twenty-two year old Kate Winslet looks gorgeous as Rose DeWitt Bukate, and plays her role to perfection. Her performance in the climax is so bloody haunting that I have goosebumps even now thinking about it. Leonardo DiCaprio's portrayal as Jack Dawson is one of his best works to date. The chemistry between them is probably the finest you will ever see on-screen. The rest of the cast, Billy Zane, Bill Paxton, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, and every other actor, is excellent. It's a shame that it didn't win any Oscars for acting!Cinematography by Russell Carpenter is absolutely splendid. The way he captured the romantic moments between Rose and Jack in the first half, and the disastrous sinking in the later half is terrific. It is one of the best work on cinematography I've seen to date. Editing by James Cameron, Conrad Buff IV and Richard A. Harris is perfect. Music by James Horner is absolutely brilliant. Be it the foot tapping Irish music for the real party under-decks, the musicians playing till the last-minute before the sink, or the ever loved ""My Heart Will Go On"", master- pieces!!James Cameron spent over a year with 300 people to digitally remaster the 1997 version into 3D. And the effort pays off, for it was fantastic to watch this masterpiece on big screen again. The 3D effect wasn't so great, but seriously, who cares?? It's TITANIC!! 3D or not, go re-live this magnum opus all over again!For more reviews, please visit sasikanth.me :)",Titanic

594,Oblomov-2,My biggest movie disappointment in over 35 years,1,27 January 2001,"First of all, as a long time student of the Titanic disaster and member of several Titanic clubs, I feel entitled to comment on the film. I don't really care how many awards and accolades the film won, but to me it is still an absolutely awful film. Cameron had the resources to make a 'proper' semi-documentary film of the disaster but unfortunately chose to turn it into a po-faced romantic mush. The fact that so many people around the world fell for it only shows, to my mind, the sad state of taste and common sense that movie critics and audiences have these days. Whoever said that all movies should have a hero and heroine falling in love? In fact most real events are anything but romantic and the Titanic disaster certainly was not one. I feel that it needed a better script and director with a semi-documentary approach and as little artistic license as possible. I almost threw up in the last sequence where the 'dead' lovers meet among the other lost passengers and crew who break out in applause. Is this an intelligent film? Ask yourself.",Titanic
595,saeedahmedsasoli,Titanic for the romance.,10,18 November 2020,"So aside from its sweeping spectacle and moving depiction of real-life tragedy, what does the story of Jack and Rose bring to the table? In spite of how persuasive the film is, one must remember - it's ultimately a work of fiction, not a documentary. Like any period drama, it is an interpretation of how society worked at the time. Jack and Rose, as well as being beautifully played by DiCaprio and Winslet, are incredibly well crafted. They are a window into a much more subtle form of racism, which is still prevalent today. It's called class, and in the latter half of the movie, it becomes a tool with which to decide who lives and who dies.First of all, just look at this film. The resplendent wonder of the film's set design, both interior and exterior, places you right on board. It looks and feels the part. And when the inevitable disaster strikes, Cameron grabs onto you and drags you through each painful moment in striking detail. The sinking of the Titanic is brought to life with exquisite attention to detail and astonishing visual effects. It makes for the greatest disaster scenes in any movie I've seen.Titanic has pretty much anything you can ask for. It's a romance; it's a disaster movie; it's an action film; it's got a sense of humour and wit; it's a period drama; it's a tragedy. Summed up, Titanic is about as perfect a cinematic experience as you're ever likely to get.The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.",Titanic
596,femaleanimefan,Beautiful and moving,2,27 February 2007,"When it comes to pure visual spectacle, Titanic is one of the best movies ever made. But the love story is great as well. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have such wonderful chemistry that it makes the occasionally poor dialogue tolerable. Their scenes together are some of the most memorable moments in romantic movie history.However, the visuals steal the show. The scenes of the Titanic sinking are some of the most beautiful yet terrible scenes ever filmed. Beautiful because it looks so real, and terrible because we know this actually happened. But that's not to say the love story is shoved into the background. The romance takes up most of the film, and their tragic ending is one that is sure to draw tears from the sensitive ones.Overall, the film is well-acted, visually masterful, and unforgettably romantic. By now, it is an absolute classic and, in my opinion, it certainly deserved it's Best Picture win at the Oscars.",Titanic

It was sentimental and it warmed many peoples' hearts.  You actually think that this movie is so funny and fake that you can't bear it and then you get to see his lifeless body frozen in the water.  The only thing that could have made this movie better is if Old Rose had been thrown into the water or killed and eaten.

I felt I was on the ship,in the dining room & struggling to get into the lifeboat.There was not a second I was bored.Kate Winslet & Leonardo DiCaprio were better than I remembered,not over-acting but giving very natural performances.Kudos to James Cameron for giving us this amazing,entertaining &stunning film.

600,angie-27,what was the point of this,1,4 April 1999,"I must admit, as a movie buff, that this was the worst piece of sap-o-rama ever the ""grace"" the screen. I mean, What was the point?  It was about two little spoiled kids running around on some stupid boat saying stuff like ""I'll never let go"". Come on!!  The romantic side of it was so contrived it felt like I was being choked as I watched it.  None of the characters were even half-way decent, and all the actors were just a waste (Leo Dicaprio is a loser) the boat was the main character, and the iceberg was the supporting actor/bad guy.  Towards the end of the movie, I was hoping the boat would just sink already just to put me out of my misery.  When Kate Winslet was threatening to throw herself overboard, I was on the edge of my seat yelling ""Jump! Do it, Jump!""  James Cameron uses the death of a thousand innocent people in an attempt to illicit some emotion out of the audience, since the characters of the movie can't do it.  The only redeeming quality of the whole film was Kathy Bates, but even she couldn't save this boat from sinking.  Let's face it, the only reason there is to watch this movie is if you got a couple of hours to kill and your dentist can't give you a root canal just right now, but you want to prepare yourself for the pain.",Titanic
601,jjh6519,Object of a massive hate campaign,10,2 September 2002,"I am aghast at the comments of others on this site about ""Titanic"".  A sense of outright hatred spews forth.  Finally, one commenter admits it: Leonardo DiCaprio was in it, and therefore the imdb ratings for the movie were doomed.  I have been to a couple of chatrooms where these teenagers go on and on about their hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio. A very personal hatred, as if they know him. Now, go to the imdb vote break-down.  Notice that a very strange thing happens.  The most votes are 10's, then 9's, then 8's, etc.  Except that a very large number -- 10.7% of the voters -- gave it a 1 rating! Really, no matter how much fault anyone may find with the movie, it is by no means a 1! That's ridiculous.  And it is done by the DiCaprio haters, in order to sink the overall rating of the movie (which, at 7.0, still isn't bad, and can you imagine how much higher it would be if the 10.7% voted with their heads and not their hate-filled hearts?). Oh yes, I know that some of you will say that James Cameron's script wasn't that good, or that he got some details wrong, blah, blah, blah. But the 10.7% is all about Leo -- nothing to do with Cameron or reality.Just to let you know:  I am a 60-year-old man, and I found the movie ""Titanic"" to be one of the most touching and spectacular that I have ever seen.  I love it! I have seen it multiple times, and the final scene of the lovers in the ocean makes me tear up every time. As for DiCaprio, he has a bad reputation for his temperment, as does Russell Crowe and many others, but DiCaprio's acting has always been first rate, and ""Titanic"" is no exception.  Just see ""This Boy's Life"" and ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" -- no second rate actor can do what he did in these films. 
In short, let's not count on imdb voters as a guide for the upcoming ""Gangs of New York"".  No doubt, the Leo-haters will be out in force, dragging down its ratings, too.One question to the 10.7%:  What horrible thing did this guy DiCaprio do to you personally?",Titanic
602,jjh6519,This movie is FAR better than the imdb rating!,10,8 October 2002,"Previously, I wrote that I loved ""Titanic"", cried at its ending (many times over), and I'm a guy in his 60's.  I also wondered about why this great movie, which won so many awards and was applauded by so many critics, was given only a 7.0 rating by imdb.com users.Well, I looked at the breakdown of the user ratings.  While 29.0% of all votes gave it a 10 rating, 10.7% gave it a 1 rating.  These 10.7% of these irrational imdb users, in effect, pulled the overall rating down to 7.0.  
In my previous comments, I blamed this very unusual voting pattern (a sudden surge in 1 ratings, with a high 10 rating, dropping only gradually and then suddenly reversing course and jumping at the 1 rating level) on only one thing: hatred for Leonardo DiCaprio.  Believe me, I've tuned into enough chat rooms to see the banter by young people (young men, mostly), who defame him left and right.  They absolutely hate the man, and they will have no part in giving him any credit in ""Titanic"".  (To answer one other user:  I am NOT talking about someone who just really doesn't like the movie that much, and gave it a 5 or a 6, etc.  Everyone has, and is entitled to, his/her own taste.  But no one can convince me that the imdb rating of only 7.0 overall for ""Titanic"", pulled to that level by an inordinate number of ridiculous 1 ratings, is a fair reflection of the overall motion picture.)Let me demonstrate my point by comparing the imdb user voting pattern of ""Titanic"" to 5 randomly chosen box office and critical ""bombs"" (there are many more, but these 5 will prove my point).  ""Heaven's Gate"" (1980) was pulled from the theaters quickly after a very poor box office showing, and imdb voters' ratings were: 23.2% 10 ratings and 9.2% 1 ratings (overall rating of 6.1).  ""Big Top Pee-wee"" (1988) got 4.3% 10 ratings and 9.9% 1 ratings (overall rating of 4.5).  ""Cat People"" (1982) got 6.1% 10 ratings and 2.6% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.8).   ""Blind Date"" (1987) got 3.0% 10 ratings and 2.8% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.3).  ""Jumpin' Jack Flash"" (1986) got 4.4% 10 ratings and 3.7% 1 ratings (overall rating of 5.2).  WHAT DO ALL OF THESE FILMS HAVE IN COMMON WITH ""TITANIC""?  ALL OF THE PERCENTAGES OF THEIR 1 RATINGS ARE LOWER !!!! THAN ""TITANIC"", AND NONE OF THESE STINKERS EVER WAS NOMINATED FOR A SINGLE AWARD.  Again, ""Titanic"" got 10.7% 1 ratings!  Compare that to the other 5 movies I just mentioned.Can there be any explanation other than the hatred of Leo factor?",Titanic
603,Filmcritic624,"Good, History Accurate? Kind of",7,16 May 2005,"I have to say, after watching it several times, this movie is still probably one of the better dramas that aired in the last part of the 1990's. Leonardo DiCapprio is great in this movie (I still would have preferred Matthew McCoughnay), and Kate Winslet is absolutely charming, although some of her scenes are a bit over-dramatic and sappy.The only problem I have with the film is historical accuracy. In most cases, Women and Children were allowed to go on, but men were allowed if there was room, not at all as the movie portrayed. The chaos wasn't as bad as the movie made it sound, in fact, many people were rather calm. Having it told by someone who wasn't even on the ship made it even worse, because giving the part to someone assuming she was 101 was unreal, completely.I could have lived without it the submarine scenes, but still, the effects for that was pretty good, kudos to James Cameron for that (Terminator is still your best work).It's good entertainment for adults, and a nice learning video for kids, although some parts of the movie (the nude scene in the cabin and the love scene in the automobile) aren't meant for children's eyes.7/10.",Titanic
604,Newski_the_Hippie,I cried....... because I paid.....,1,3 October 2005,"This movie is proof that everything Loyd Kaufman said about Major Studios is right. They force their crap down our throats, remove the art from film-making, and award budgets and names instead of ingenuity and talent.This movie is bad from beginning to end. It's not just that I hate movies that are hyped, this movie is just hard to watch. I want romance, not people saying I love you over and over again. And I want a real couple, not a couple of star crossed lovers pulled out of the average crappy teen drama. And I want, maybe this is too much, to feel for the people who died on the Titanic, not cheer when the ship finally goes down.The special effects were phenomenal. But that does not make the movie great. I never liked the characters. Rich girl and poor artist. So? Why am I supposed to like them? Because they belong together even though they come from different worlds? Give me more then that. Neither of the characters was anything more then an empty shell of a being. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio tried their best but could not pump life into the characters.Many films came out that year. Many great ones. This wins the Oscar why? Do people like movies that are driven only by a tragedy that means nothing because we care nothing about the people? We have a real story. One of the most famous disasters of the 21st Century, the struggle of the people on the ship, and those trying to save them. The people who survived, those who met their demise. We don't need a love story that is completely without love.",Titanic
605,imdb-58910,My favorite film,10,25 January 2019,"I absolutely like this movie! It is the best romantic drama, fantastic direct, gripping music, very good actors, beautiful story... great combination that predestines good results. The film stars Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater) and Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson).
The story is about young lover were so different world. Rose is very rich girl. She is engagement with rich man- Caledon Hockley. Rose is unhappy, she must leave to New York to she could get married in NYC. They travel in upper-class with her mother Ruth. Jack and his friend Fabrizio win third-class tickets to the ship in a game. Rose want kill herself. Jack- poore boy and painter save her before jump from ship. Lovers met and love story started...
This story always inspiring me and I often thinking about this film, this story. About lifes a thousand people, about ,,Ship of dream""
My opinion is that life is too short and we must enjoy every moment with people that we loved. Titanic is about this.
You will certainly give me the truth when I write that Titanic is very moving.

606,jason-210,A Night to Remember at the Cinema,6,26 January 2009,"Anyone who saw the old black & white movie ""A Night to Remember"" will appreciate the improved special effects in this one, but miss the more accurate portrayal of the historic event. James Cameron really managed to bring the old ship back to life for the big screen, but at the same time he strayed from history, painting a negative and inaccurate picture of the crew and passengers.I'm not referring to the fictitious love story between the two fictitious characters Kate and Jack. This addition is clearly pure invention, a device to involve the audience's emotions in the tragedy in a way that a documentary style film doesn't. That's fine. What's not fine to twist the historical facts about real people, which Cameron clearly does in this film. Many of the portrayals of the crew members are fictionalized. I suppose it's forgivable to make ordinary people into heroes, but to make heroes into villains, as this film does, is I think, unethical. It's damaging to the memory of those people, and I'm sure it's offensive to their surviving descendants.The biggest misrepresentation is of 1st Officer Murdoch, who is portrayed as losing his mind and shooting passengers and himself during the sinking during the evacuation. In reality Murdoch did not shoot passengers or himself. The writers of the film completely made this up. Captain Smith is portrayed as a weak, ineffectual human being incapable of making decisions. For me, Bernard Hill was wrongly cast in this role - he does not have the charisma and presence of Smith. According to most studies and records, Smith was also active until the very end. A one point he was calling back boats on his megaphone when he saw that they weren't full – a scene that was edited out of the movie for the final release.I've always had mixed feelings about this film. The effects, sets, costumes and technical accuracy are impressive; as are some of the characters. I particularly like the chief engineer, and Murdoch; but there are aforementioned inaccuracies, and also many unnecessarily silly bits like the scene with Cal chasing Jack and Kate down the grand staircase with a gun, firing shots as he went, which cheapen the film.I think that, when you make a film like this, dealing with such a monumental tragedy, with characters representing real people in recent history, it's very shameful to invent bad things about them.But all in all this remains an epic film and was one of the most impressive films I'd ever seen at the cinema back when I first saw it in 1997.",Titanic
607,cathyyoung1,Delighted to find so many fellow Titanic-bashers,5,10 May 2000,"The only good thing about this movie are the special effects (truly incredible!), including the underwater scenes.  What else does it have? Let's see:One of the worst screenplays ever put on film.One-dimensional, dull, trite characters who are either improbably admirable (our lovely Rose can appreciate Picasso, knows all about Dr. Freud, and can figure out that there aren't enough lifeboats for all the passengers!) or ridiculously evil (Cal, the guy played by Billy Zane).  Not to mention tiresome cliches of the noble poor vs the ignoble rich.Leonardo di Caprio, basically modeling instead of acting.  Kate Winslet doing a more decent job, but nowhere near her performance in ""Sense and Sensibility"" where she was given a real character to play.The only emotion generated by this movie came from knowing that more than 1,200 people actually did die on the Titanic.  And even the disaster scenes weren't nearly as affecting as they should have been -- because the lives and deaths of thousands became merely a backdrop to the romance between Kate and Leo (sorry, Rose and Jack) and the question of whether they would survive.  (Personally, I found myself wishing they had both drowned early in the movie when Rose tried to jump and Jack was going to jump after her.)If you want to see a GOOD movie about the Titanic, rent ""A Night to Remember.""  It was made, I think, in 1948 and obviously had very poor special effects by today's standards, but it did an incomparably superior job of telling the story of the ship and its passengers.  (By the way, the only good bits of dialogue in ""Titanic"" -- the conversations between the crew when they realize the ship is going to sink -- are basically lifted from that film.)  Wisely, ""A Night to Remember"" doesn't focus on a couple of central characters and instead shows us many different people, who are much more fully fleshed out in the small vignettes they get than Jack and Rose were in all those unbearable hours of screen time.  In that way, ""A Night to Remember"" truly captures the human tragedy of what happened.The fact that ""Titanic"" won the Best Picture award in a year that saw such superb films as ""LA Confidential"" and (one of my all-time favorites) ""Boogie Nights"" just shows the cowardice of the Academy and the marketing power of 13-year-old girls.",Titanic

That is what kills Titanic.  The movie is visually stunning and the story moves along fairly well, but the acting is just not up to snuff. This surprised me a bit because DiCaprio and Winslet have been good individually in other movies, but here they seem wooden and constrained by sappy dialogue.My other major problem with this movie is the predictability inherent in the story.  I will say that I am prejudiced against movies that don't contain some element of surprise.  Because this is a movie about the Titanic you know the boat sinks (unless you slept through elementary school).  It makes the end rather anti-climactic. So why is this the highest grossing movie of all time?  Because apparently 14 year old girls will pay again and again to watch a tragic love story on the big screen.  It only took me one viewing to realize I don't ever need to watch this movie again.  2/10.",Titanic

Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), a lovely and spirited 17-year-old aristocrat, is forced into an engagement with the haughty and controlling Cal Hockley, heir to steel millions, so as to rescue her family's fortunes. Feeling trapped, she decides to jump into the ocean but is stopped by Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). Although poor, Jack is enterprising and courageous and full of fun, and the two quickly fall in love. But Cal will not let things rest, and pursues them doggedly even as the ship is sinking. I like how the movie began in the future, with 102-year-old Rose telling her story to the salvage crew hunting for the famed blue diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. As alluring as treasure is, the listeners are soon captivated by one of the most beautiful love stories ever told.

615,DhavalVyas,Mixed emotions after seeing it years later.,6,27 August 2004,"Titanic' was quite the phenomenon when it came out. There is no movie that I can think of, at least in my lifetime, that became the cultural event that it did. There were many concerns within the film community that the film was going to be a disaster. James Cameron had spent a long time finishing the film and it was the most costly film ever made. Many people thought it was bring an end to his career. All these concerns and predictions were shattered when 'Titanic' came out; it became the highest grossing movie ever and it won more Academy awards than any other movie. It skyrocketed the careers of both Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio. I went to the theaters to see it with family and friends. It was an incredible experience and several people around me were crying. There were very few movies I had ever seen before that had mesmerized me as much as this movie did.I watched this movie in its entirety for the first time in years. The reaction is much different now and the film seems much less impressive. First of all, the graphics in 'Titanic' have not aged well. When the ship is sinking, the CGIs look really fake and dated. Also, the model ship they used doesn't look very good either. It looks cheap and like it was made out of plastic! This does not surprise me because most films do not age well; a new generation of film lovers will not find certain films as impressive as the last generation. Putting that aside, the story of 'Titanic' is not that bad. I think most people know what the story is about so I do not need to explain it. The acting is slightly above average, but the screenplay is so clichéd and corny, I can understand the acting did not need to be that impressive. The last forty minutes of the film consists of the two main characters shouting, ""Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack! Rose, Rose, Rose, Rose!"" They must love each other so much that they can't think of anything else to say.I don't think 'Titanic' is destined to become a classic. Even though it made so much money and won so many awards, I think most people now see the movie as an embarrassment. Now that I am older and wiser, 'Titanic' just seems like a mediocre film. Pretty disappointing considering how much the movie was loved when it first came out.",Titanic

Probably one day, I don't think enough time has passed to truly call this a classic just yet, but of course it definitely has all the makings of one. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio shot to fame with this film, and I have to say even though they are OK, I don't think either of them struck me with their talent. They are both marvelous actors, but it wasn't until years later that I really believed that. Still, they have wonderful chemistry and make the love story believable and heartfelt. As for the film itself, it is a grand scale film, really something to enjoy on a big screen if possible.

I had heard a lot of s#*t talked about this movie, but on the other hand it won all those Oscars... I didn't really know what to expect. But I gotta say it was pretty good. Nice acting, good plot, pretty good character development... really a pretty enjoyable watch. I'm not beating myself up for taking so long to watch it or anything, but I'm also glad to finally have it watched.7/10, 14 out of 55 movies for 1997, 129th of 1990s, 367th all time",Titanic
619,SnobbyDude,"Contrived, and in many ways, offensive",2,15 January 2003,"Truth is stranger (and more interesting) than fiction, and this movie proves it.  Aspiring comedians that take courses on perfecting their art are always told that their real life is a much more interesting place to start than the imagination when writing material.  Why?  Truth is often more interesting than anything that you can come up with on your own.  I think this is the reason why this movie is so contrived and phony.  Rich girl, poor boy, snobby/evil/shallow rich people, noble/happy poor people...can you get any less original?  The stereotypes are offensive as well.  All the Irish people are drinking, partying, poor people, and the rich are all cold-hearted wasps.  Then there is the dialog.  I was cringing at every line and actually felt bad for the actors because they had such awful lines to work with. When I first saw this movie, I thought the lines sounded so bad, in part, because of some poor acting.  Since then, I have seen other movies with Leo in them and can see that he is a good actor, but just had some awful material to work with in Titanic.I wish that the creators of this film used the real story of the titanic as a source of their inspiration.  Instead, the main focus of the movie isn't the titanic or all the real people that lost their lives in this tragedy. The movie is really mostly about a fake love story that reaches new heights of cheesyness.  I think making a movie about two fake people (two fake annoying people) named Jack and Rose makes light of a very real event where many real people died.  I bet every single one of those real people had a more interesting life than Jack and Rose.The movie does, however, have one good thing going for it.  It does have good special effects.  This saves it from getting the lowest possible score. I gave it 2/10",Titanic
620,nirome,Timeless and epic masterpiece,10,22 March 2019,"On a purely technical level, Titanic was considered at the time the crowning achievement of a filmmaker who's always strived to top his last cinematographic entry with the next. Up until that point and still to this day, he's managed to do just that. He's always made the most of the technological advantages at the time and always come up with a jaw-dropping, mesmerizing visual spectacle. Even at times when budget constraints and uncooperative technical crew, due in part for his apparent lack of experience and fresh off- the- boat from his first serious outing on the directorial chair for The Terminator, like it was the case in Aliens, he's always managed to deliver. It sure does take him a long time to come up with the next one, but everytime he does, he hits the box office's bullseye.
This time around and, with one of the more simplistic storylines ever put to the big screen, he brings us one of the most memorable and fondly remembered movies of the late 90s.
From the very first shot of the movie, those sepia color-corrected images that convey a haunting feeling of remembrance and loss, to the first images of the research vessel subs exploring the entrails of the haunted ship, we plunge right into what it must have felt like walking onto the deck of the Titanic. And we go back to the plot. As I said before, using the simplest of plot devices, a , on the other hand, very well told love story with tinges of social clashing, we are treated to a 3 hour, eye - catching spectacle that moves along at a whip-like pace. With very strong performances all throughout, gorgeous cinematography and production design, state-of-the-art visual and practical effects and a perfect score by the great late James Horner, this is probably one of Cameron's best efforts behind the camera and a movie for the ages. Needless to say, the strongest asset of the movie is its third and final act, with the depiction of the sinking of the titular ship and the resulting mayhem. That, as always, and with the character development groundwork previously laid out by Cameron, is the main reason to watch this movie, and why the audience is so invested in what's happening onscreen. As I said, great movie and larger-than-life characters to go with it.",Titanic

It is truly a gem among films. The cinematography is absolutely breathtaking, easily some of the best that I have ever seen. The performances from both Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are some of the truest and most heartfelt ever. Their chemistry is perfect, totally and utterly believable. James Cameron does an awesome job directing. The suspense remains the entire time, even though you know how it's going to turn out. My only problem with Titanic is the length. Seriously, a good half hour - 45 minutes could have been cut from the end. Do we really need to see all of those people drown? Yes and no. No, because 3 hours and 14 minute is way to long, even for an epic movie. Yes, because it makes the entire thing more believable and all the more heart/gut wrenching. Titanic is an amazing movie, but not one that you can see a ton of times. The 1st time it's amazing, the 2nd time it's okay, the 3rd time you end up checking your watch ever 5 minutes waiting for it to be over. A solid 10/10.",Titanic

A luxury liner, bound for the States, is struck by an iceberg and, with inadequate safeguards, sinks quickly, claiming the lives of 1,500+ souls. This movie, in very delicate ways, brings this point home.By intertwining the lives of a first-class passenger, Rose, and a third-class passenger, Jack, the moviegoer is thrust into both worlds. Slowly, and tragically, we witness how money means everything in the early 1900's, to the point of overlooking security, thus eliminating an adequate number of lifeboats because ""they make the deck look too cluttered.""  I never knew, until seeing this film, that White Star staff literally locked the gates so that third-class passengers could not emerge to board the boats.  Irish genecide.The computer-generated images of the Titantic tearing apart and sinking are breath-taking, so much so that when I first saw this film in the theatre, viewers alternately wept and gasped at the inhumanity of it all.

631,Eightiesjunkie,How low the mighty have fallen!,1,14 May 2014,"To begin with, I liked James Cameron as a director. As a matter of fact, Aliens is my all-time favorite movie. Throughout the 80's and mid 90's James Cameron could do no wrong, then it happened: Christmas 1997 James Cameron released the most overrated, over-hyped piece of garbage that the world has ever known: Titanic! I don't buy for a second, that Cameron cared about the real tragedy, the victims, or the heroes! I firmly believe that Cameron's sole intention for making this movie was to fatten his wallet! Critics praised it as a masterpiece, Teen and preteen girls swooned, and before you knew it, this rancid, vomit inducing, cinematic travesty became the highest grossing movie of all time! Before I begin, let me just clarify one thing: I don't hate this movie because it was a hit, I hate this movie for much more than that! So the film begins with treasure hunters exploring the wreck of the Titanic. They're searching for something, but we don't know what that exactly is yet. They find an old safe, and decide to bring it up to the surface. They cheer, pop champagne bottles, and celebrate that they've found what they've been looking for. However, once the safe is opened, they only find an old drawing of a woman wearing a diamond necklace. Some time later, a local news station does a story on the treasure hunters' expedition. An old woman watching the news story recognizes the drawing, contacts the leader of the expedition, and they bring her to where they are. We find out that they are searching for that lost diamond necklace, and that she is the woman in the drawing. So the film then goes into her story, and to sum it all up, we get the same old cliché-ridden love story, we've all seen before! Two people from two different worlds fall in love, and everything is working against their union. Some of you out there might be thinking that I hate this movie because I'm a guy, and generally, guys hate love stories. but that's not the case. I liked the movie Moulin Rouge, and I loved the movie The Notebook. The difference between those movies and this movie is: They actually did something NEW with that basic plot! Unlike Titanic, in which the only thing ""new"" is that that it happens on the Titanic. In the story, we meet characters that have the names of real people. These people include: Captain E.J. Smith, Designer Thomas Andrews, Builder Bruce Ismay, Crewman William Murdoch, and passengers, John Jacob Astor and ""The Unsinkable"" Molly Brown. Do we learn anything about these people or what happened to them? NO! These Characters are nothing more than plot devices! THIS, is the reason why I hate this movie! It is an insult to these people's family and memory to portray them this way! Specifically, William Murdoch's and Molly Brown's. In reality, these people were heroes! In this film however, Molly Brown is used as a comic relief, and William Murdoch, is made into a villain! James Cameron, How dare you!! In 2001, the movie Pearl Harbor was released, and everyone hated it. People have said that the movie was poorly written, the plot was horribly cliché, and that it makes a cheap mockery of a real life tragedy. What people fail to realize is: This is exactly what Titanic was! Why is Pearl Harbor labeled as cinematic tripe and garbage, while a few years earlier, Titanic did the EXACT same thing and it's labeled a masterpiece! If you're going to hold Michael Bay's feet to the fire for Pearl Harbor, you might as well do the same to James Cameron. I know a lot of people still love this movie, and that's fine, to each their own. In my opinion however, there will never be enough hatred for this film, Even if everyone in the world turned around and suddenly hated it, it still wouldn't be enough!",Titanic

Still, i only partly put that glaring error down to the unfortunate american who wrote it. After seeing Titanic i would have got the impression Southampton is in Ireland too. The ship was built in Belfast which was British then and is British now, so to make up for that and appease the Irish American audience they fill the ship with poor unfortunates from the emerald isle whose only role in the film seems to be getting screwed by the English ""tyrants"" who run the ship. Add a few poor but heroic Americans to the mix and you've got a blockbuster. To be fair, i hate this type of film anyway so it was never going to get a good review from me. 2 / 10",Titanic

I was looking to see if anyone had reviewed yet, more on the film's re release in its 3D glory - sadly they hadn't so I though if i want to know if its worth the price tag I will have to go. Considering myself to be interested in the titanic - not enough to call myself a Titanorack mind - I have learnt a lot about that ship, whether it be on the t.v or in books. Curiosity got the better of me and I decided to don on the 3D glasses required and watch the movie. James Cameron is the king of 3D. 3D to me being pretty much a gimmick which i think only works with made for 3D films on the big screen only. Avatar is the perfect example of this. Although i didn't care for the film much the 3D is sensational. Made for 3D movies such as Avatar and Piranha etc I have enjoyed and found them effective. You can see a lot of effort has gone into the 3D for Titanic. Some of the scenes are magnificent. The lifeboats rowing away being the best 3D scene for me in the film. Was that worth the price of the ticket? I am very undecided. I love this film and have seen it numerous times and I am not sure 3D added anything extra to the film because it wasn't made for 3D it didn't have the same effect for me. I think for me it was a chance again to see the film of the big screen which I enjoyed again very much. One thing I did think about on seeing it in 3D yesterday was why on earth was Billy Zane in this film? He is more hammy than William Shatner in Star Trek and not in a good way. But where this film is concerned my heart will always go on ..so if you want to know if its worth going to see in 3D I would say if you are a massive fan or never seen it before yes, otherwise not..",Titanic

I re-watched Titanic the other day and loved it just as much as ever, the brewing romance between DiCaprio and Winslett, the ill-fated attempt to make the Titanic famous, and the social issues between lower class and upper class people.It's understandable to see why this film was so expensive...but I don't care, because it pulled it off. James Cameron worked a miracle with this film and truly deserves every bit of credit and more... there is almost nothing bad I can say about this film except for the fact that the whole ""chase and shoot whilst boat is sinking"" was a little bit too far fetched...but hey, it's only a film and it was still good entertainment.If you haven't seen the film, please ignore the hate buzz around and watch it, you will enjoy it....9/10",Titanic
639,stephen7272,A simple psychological script,9,11 April 2013,"Titanic is not what you think it is. You think it's a flimsy love story, about a skinny lad and a dumpy girl, set against the background of an historic event in 1912.No, it's an experiment in mega-viewing. It's the Gone With The Wind of it's day. Both of them smashed box office records.This movie is about getting bums on seats, just as GWTW was. So how did they do it? (I won't tell you because it's a global trade secret in human psychology.)Nah, I'll tell you: it's the script! They did it by making every word, every line, of the script fail. At the beginning of the movie when you heard Di Caprio's friend say he was going to America (""L'AMERICA!!!""), you knew he would fail. When the owner of the liner said the ship was unsinkable, you knew those words would fail. When Billy Zane tried to bribe the crew member to get a seat on the lifeboat, you knew his words would fail. Every line of the script (ok, not absolutely every line, but most of the main character lines) resulted in failure. That, ladies and gents, in a nutshell is how you make a blockbuster movie.In GWTW, Scarlet says to Rett Butler, ""Where shall I go? What shall I do?"". He replies ""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn."" Scarlet's words fail. In Titanic, Jacks final words to Rose as he dies of cold are ""Rose, listen to me. Listen. Winning that ticket was the best thing that ever happened to me."" Err...that's nonsense. He's dying.

640,Fire God,Good Movie,7,23 February 1999,"First of all I want to express how impressed I am at how intelligent so many of the comments here have been. It kind of surprised me, because I figured the average person who loved or hated the movie Titanic would be at least a little bit on the dull side. We are talking about people who, in my opinion, got so carried away with the romance that they completely over-rated the film, or people who I thought were going to blast the film for stupid and superficial reasons. I was wrong. The comments here have been fantastic.This was a good movie, but it is not one of my favorites of all time. It is a very beautiful film at first, and obviously becomes ugly when we slowly watch the brutal disaster get worse and worse. We know that the ship sinks, we know that many people died, and we know that it was a long time ago, but Cameron succeeds in bringing new and intense emotions out of us anyway.While Titanic has hard work, precision, and passion, it does lack some real intelligent writing. Much of this movie is like a high quality soap opera filled with chatter and non-verbal language that left me bored several times.Still I thought the romance, special effects, music, and acting were all good enough for me to enjoy the Titanic, and will probably watch it several times.I have seen several people here change their minds about Titanic, when their original opinion was way on one side or the other of the spectrum. That is because when you use your open-mindedness, you will probably find that this is not a near-perfect film, nor is it a piece of crap; but that the Titanic is a pretty damn good movie, plain and simple.",Titanic

 Cameron's pile of garbage known as Titanic is! This film, which should 
 have been about the actual sinking of the great luxary ship Titanic, 
 instead relies on a 90210 idiotic love story to ""carry"" the picture 
 through. IF the two main characters had been interesting, it might have 
 been a better picture, but, alas, the two leads, Jack Dawson, and Rose 
 Bukater are about as interesting as watching paint dry. Rose isn't 
 suffering from oppression, she's suffering from SPOILED BRAT syndrome! 
 Jack comes along like a teenage pretty boy rather than a compelling 
 character that the audience relates to.
 
 The film does have a few assets such as costume design, and some of the 
 special effects are pretty good. However, it's the whole script and 
 it's 90210 meets the Titanic setting that makes this the most OVERRATED 
 film in the history of motion pictures! This film grossed $600 million

 drugs into the prints of the film to hypnotize movie audiences and 
 academy members who gave this stinker Best Picture of 1997 over the

642,Twillhead,Ultra-Hollywood Spin on one of the 20th Century's Most Famous Disasters,8,10 June 1999,"Being of a rather sensitive nature, I steered clear of ""Titanic"", mostly because I did not want to witness the deaths of the 1500+ people who perished in the icy Atlantic waters in 1912. Thus I only recently saw the film on video, months after all the hype, the awards, and subsequent hoopla had played itself out. ""Titanic"" is certainly a lush, beautifully photographed and well-mounted film, although it is almost a bit too ""slick"" for my tastes. I thought Leo and Kate were blandly likable, but I was not very much interested in their characters or their performances. The supporting cast, however, was top-notch, in particular Frances Fisher's remarkably restrained performance as Rose's mother. Ms. Fisher did more acting with a 3-second, tight-lipped glance of disapproval then Leo did with 3 hours worth of stilted dialogue. And Billy Zane managed to twist his classically handsome features into an oily, and sometimes frightening, visage of callow shallowness. The wonderful Kathy Bates always lends a touch of class to whatever role she undertakes, and as Molly Brown she doesn't disappoint. I would have been much more interested in the plot if the story had been told from Molly's perspective rather than Rose's. But the real point of the film is the tragedy itself, which is depicted with harrowing, overwhelming clarity during the sinking sequence. On this level, I think the film is fully realized; however, the fictitious story line is seriously flawed, and I have a difficult time believing Leo as a romantic leading man. In ""Titanic"" he's more like the arrogant kid who should be taken to the woodshed and spanked.",Titanic

Benjamin guggenheim, the world's most famous pipeline tycoon, who marched to his death in the lobby to keep his cool.The only British crewman to return to rescue.A band playing its last song in the face of death.The old couple waiting to die in the cabin...
In 1997, it was amazing to be able to make such realistic effects. Director James Cameron built and destroyed the Titanic for effect with such boldness and seriousness. Success is inevitable.

Yes I did cry to this movie and I have seen many depressing movies including Angela's Ashes (if you have not seen it then I recommend you do not see it b/c you will literally cry to death) and this has been the only movie I've cried to. And I don't care if you say its too depressing to watch. I watched it a second time and I cried just as much as I did as the first time. And you know what, it was great. If you have a girlfriend/wife, and if neither or one of you hasn't seen it, go see it together. She will cry (maybe) but you will get laid. How do I know this; experience. James Cameron, your movies are the best. Do not stop making movies. I really want to see what you will surprise everyone with next.",Titanic
645,TinyDanseur27,So sad. So beautiful. Titanic is a brilliant movie of epic proportions.,10,25 June 2013,"In honor of the 100 year anniversary of the sinking of the Titanic, the movie Titanic was re-released in theaters, digitally remastered and in 3-D. Having seen the movie in theaters in 1998 when it came out, and loving it ever since, I was happy to go see it again in 2012. We owned the VHS when I was growing up so I've probably seen Titanic at least a dozen times. There's nothing quite like seeing it in theaters though. It's a film of epic proportions in both budget and content, and I think seeing it on the big screen does it incredible justice. I thoroughly enjoyed seeing it there for the second time.I think many people criticize Titanic for the ""cheesy love story"". Jack and Rose are the early 1900's version of Romeo and Juliet, complete with a history that spans a mere few days, clashing backgrounds and of course Jack's death at the end of the movie. They even have some corny dialogue here and there (ex: ""I'll never let go Jack. I'll never let go.""). In spite of that however, I thoroughly enjoy their story. I feel that, unlike Romeo and Juliet, Jack and Rose's attraction to each other is genuine. She loves him because he pulls her out of her shell and shows her that there is more to life than money and social status. He loves her because she takes a chance on him despite societal expectations and loves him for who he truly is. I think it's great. Call me a romantic but I'm a sucker for their story. On a side note, it's so surreal to see Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet so young. They've certainly evolved as actors since Titanic.What James Cameron and his crew were able to do with special effects, construction and design in Titanic just floors me. Titanic is just so horrifyingly authentic. Every scream, every person crushed from a torrent of water, every piece of the ship ripped apart just looked so real to me. I think that's why I like it so much. I don't get my kicks from seeing people suffer, but there was something strangely beautiful in how that movie was shot and how the action of the ship sinking unfolds. I really felt like I was there with all those people. I really appreciated just how many different scenes there were. They made it a point to address many different parts of the ship, many different people and many different horrific ends. So sad. So beautiful. I hope that makes some sense.So now you know, I'm a sucker for Titanic. Guilty as charged.",Titanic
646,StoryCharts,Love conquers death,5,14 August 2013,Titanic is about the idea that love conquers death. It demonstrates this idea with a love story between Jack and Rose that has its ups and downs but is sealed with Rose's decision to stay on the sinking ship and risk death rather than escape the Titanic alone. Jack returns her love in kind by saving her from freezing but dying in the process. Rose remembers her love for almost 80 years and returns to the spot Titanic sank to throw a priceless diamond into the ocean in memory of Jack. The main plots of their love and Jack's doomed escape from Titanic are supported by additional plots of Hockley's escape from the ship and the treasure hunters search for the diamond.The story's focus stays true to the main love and escape plots that constitute the idea that love conquers death (love endures despite and because of Jack's death). The side plots provide fuel for the main turning points and add the final clincher of Rose remembering her love for decades by throwing away the diamond in memory of Jack. James Cameron really knew what he was doing with the story and it shows in the Story Chart.My Story Chart of the movie is at storycharts.ca.,Titanic
647,FargoUT,"Why, oh why? A great film is being bashed!",10,30 August 1998,"Jealousy.  It's a powerful thing, wouldn't you say?  In fact, so much that people would ridicule and bash a film that gained so much popularity.  It is all a matter of jealousy.  If you hear anyone tell you otherwise, they are lying.  The people who bash the film are the same people who thought it would flop.  Because it didn't, they are trying to find new things to complain about it.  ""It's too long..."" and all that crap.  Of course, ironically, these are the people who just love Gone With the Wind, which is even longer, running at 4 hours!  Titanic is a great film.  It's a tragic love story... simple, but completely effective.  It's haunting in it's portrayal of Jack and Rose.  The film was supposed to evoke emotions, and a complex story can not do that.  If you watch The English Patient, you don't cry.  You just watch with fascination. Titanic makes you cry.  Simplicity is the key.  We've seen all sorts of films on Titanic, but they all focus on cardboard characters.  By making us care for Jack and Rose, we eventually care for everyone aboard.  Jealousy even takes a part in the film.  This reflexivity is actually rather humorous considering that Cal Hockley was jealous of Jack for getting Rose's love.  Cal Hockley represents all the people that bash Titanic.  Jack represents Titanic.  And Rose is the masses of critics and audiences that do love it.  Did Cameron purposely write a screenplay of this type in order to reflect how people would really feel?  I doubt it, but the similarities are quite striking.  In a period when films are mostly centered around special effects and style, Titanic comes along and heralds back to the old days of making films.  But, when it tries to do this, it gets ridiculed by many.  These people should take heed because if they do this, they are giving themselves bad names... they would rather watch Armageddon than Titanic.  Gone With The Wind is the most obvious comparison here.  When watching it today for the first time, I thought the romance was lame, because it wasn't romantic.  It displayed a moronic lead female who couldn't make up her mind.  Titanic is a postmodernistic tale of love that we should all comprehend.  We would just love to find someone like Jack or Rose.  But alas most of us won't.  Watching it on screen is the closest we will come.  People that bash it are obviously haters of love, and maybe never feel anything at all.  Titanic is a great film.  The best of 1997 and one of the best ever made.  Cameron has done something no one ever expected : he made a successful film based entirely on love.  Now, how ironic is that ?",Titanic
648,Aleona,Good movie but overrated!,6,19 August 1999,"So much has been said about Titanic that it's hard to come up with anything new. Some people claim it's the greatest thing ever directed, others say one is too high of a rating. I fit in the middle. This movie had beautiful setting and scenery, some gorgeous shots of the ocean and the sunset. Three thumbs up to those who shot those scenes. And this movie DID have a plot, it didn't need to be three hours long, but non the less it was present. Titanic was a tragedy and this movie was not a celebration of it, it tried to put a story to it which it did. Although the characters were fictional, perhaps stories of the sort did happen (certainly not as dramatic though).Characters could of been a little more developed because with the exception of Sally Brown they were all black and white. I personally really liked the reactions of different people to what was happening on the ship. Nobility of the captain, mother's prayers, musicians attitude etc. Cameron very well portrayed those people.Something was missing from the plot however, it in a way lacked emotions. As I watching this movie, I realized that what was happening on that ship was awful, but I didn't get a sense of reality from it. I didn't feel the horror to the bones and I certainly didn't feel the pain of those people who were drowning. I mean, I knew it was there, I just didn't experience everything they did emotionally, and a good movie should make a person do that.I don't think this movie deserved an Oscar but it still deserved attention as a good movie with imperfections. After all, very few movies are flawless.",Titanic

650,vangamer,Cameron's History Lesson,1,24 February 2021,"Top 7 Takeaways from Jim Cameron's Titanic:7. In a true maritime disaster story, including a potential rescue ship (let's call it the California) that failed to act with tragic consequences adds no drama at all and must be ignored in the screenplay.
6. Ignoring the California may also be useful if the film has a short running time - say, only 3 hours.
5. People in 1912 spoke and thought exactly like people in the 1990s.
4. Rich people are bad.
3. Poor people are good.
2. Being trapped below decks on a sinking ship lacks drama - ensure a lead character is also chained during the sinking.

651,Iammymothersdaughter2,Not a dry eye in the house (except mine).,4,30 November 2001,"This movie was disappointing.  It lacked genuineness.  Yes, the attention to detail regarding the recreation of the Titanic was excruciatingly correct and that I can't complain about.  But, at the heart of the matter, the cheese ball romance between the main characters ruined this movie for me.
Ms. Winslet and Mr. DiCaprio's characters were too far-fetched and both of their performances seemed overblown and campy.  After watching the Oscar acceptance speech of their illustrious director, I no longer wonder why. Some people may think of Mr. Cameron as a 'mad genius' - my opinion is that he's just a megalomaniacal freak.  To be fair, the crowd I went with to watch this flick all cried at what were supposed to be the touching moments - so perhaps I'm a little too hard boiled. The one bright spot I can think of was Kathy Bates performance as the unsinkable Molly Brown.  She is a fantastic actress, and if her performance was campy and over the top, that's because it was supposed to be & she had it down in spades.  Overall this movie was a dry, disappointing experience.",Titanic

653,Kane20,Review - Titanic,10,2 July 2012,"James Cameron's Titanic is proof that a movie doesn't have to be original to be good. I'm not saying that originality is bad; I like it, it's good, but it's a minor factor in how good a movie/story is. The story doesn't necessarily have to be original, but it has to be compelling to people; has to capture the emotion and interest of the audience and keep them riveted throughout. Titanic does just that. It captures the heart and interest of the viewer and keeps it completely riveted all the way through the end (it did for many people, anyway, including me).Titanic combines fiction with non-fiction, the more important of which is probably the non- fiction aspect: the tragic sinking of the luxury cruiser R. M. S. Titanic in 1912. There have been a few films that portrayed the tragic event (such as Titanic in 1953 and A Night To Remember in 1958). Then, in 1997, along came James Cameron, who, despite some weaknesses with script and dialogue, is good at storytelling, and always pushes the advancement of visual and special effects, and uses them to his advantage. Therefore, a film about the Titanic was a perfect project for him. The recreation of the ship is great, with excellent detail and scope. Except for a few brief moments here and there when something doesn't look quite real, it's it looks spellbindingly realistic, and, while watching it, it felt almost like I was really there. James Cameron really spent his $200 million budget wisely.Some of that money also went into filming some footage of the actual wreck at the bottom of the ocean. This footage is seen in a scene at the beginning of the movie, shot via a remote- controlled underwater camera. As Roger Ebert says, ""These shots strike precisely the right note; the ship calls from its grave for its story to be told."" However, instead of only telling a story of only the real event, he also weaves a fictional story ingeniously into it, specifically an almost Romeo and Juliet-like story of forbidden love. In modern times (actually, during the time the film was made), a fictitious survivor of the Titanic sinking, old Rose DeWitt Bukater (Gloria Stuart), tells the story via flashback, and tells about her brief yet intense forbidden love affair with Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio).Seventeen-year-old Rose (Kate Winslett), from a wealthy upper-class background, is betrothed to a rich snob, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). She hates this, and is extremely miserable. Meanwhile, Jack is basically poor, and he wins a ticket to the Titanic in a lucky win in a card game. He eventually finds Rose, who is about to commit suicide by jumping off the ship, and he saves her life. What follows is the development of their forbidden love story, which is told in such a way that shows off different parts of the magnificent cruise ship. It's a simple, predictable, and clichéd story, but it's still very compelling, especially since we know how that the ship is going to sink eventually and cause heartbreaking results on their romance (predictability is actually good here).Meanwhile, there is the subplot regarding the actual historical events leading up to the sinking - the arrogance of the builders and the people who ran the ship (they thought the ship was unsinkable). At the midpoint of the movie, the ship hits the iceberg, and the second half of the movie begins, and develops into a thrilling yet tense and dramatic race for survival. The entire movie, from start to finish, is handled extremely well in terms of story, and is completely full of heart and soul; it's all very strong in emotion. And yes, it's predictable, but in this case it actually adds to the power of the movie. But it's not completely predictable. There are a lot of things that are not fully given away, like exactly who dies (besides Jack) and who lives (besides Rose), and some other things along the way, too.Some people would definitely argue that the love story between Jack and Rose is completely unnecessary, but it actually helps the movie. It adds more emotion to the story and makes it that much more compelling. It also provides more structure to the story and the showing-off of the ship, and even allows the audience to really connect with the passengers on the ship (innocent people whose lives are ultimately ruined or permanently altered as a result of the builders' arrogance and ignorance – unsinkable, yeah right). And the special effects also made the film work well, too. However, despite having great special effects in his film, James Cameron did not lose sight of what's truly important – story, characters, emotion, etc. The movie does not rely on special effects. It wouldn't have worked nearly as well without them, but they are not the main driving force of the film.If I had to criticize one thing about the film, it would be the length. In my opinion, it's too long, at three hours and fifteen minutes. However, it still works brilliantly as it is. Every moment of the story serves a great and important contribution to the story, the drama, the emotion, and everything else. The performances by the actors were very good, the pacing of the film is great (if a bit lengthy at times), and the tone of the film is great. James Horner's score is fantastic, very memorable, absolutely beautiful, and perfect for the film. And, despite having a good deal of fiction in it, the movie excellently portrays the historical tragic sinking of the Titanic, and captures the horror and tragedy brilliantly. With lots of heart, suspense, drama, and great historical portrayal combined with fiction and stunningly realistic visual and special effects, James Cameron's Titanic is arguably the best film of 1997.My Rating: **** (out of ****)Fore more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com",Titanic

I've found that, on video, it's best watched in several sessions! I was an early fan of James Cameron and am depressed to see the extent that success has led him to excess. As in THE ABYSS, the director's self-importance seems to radiate from the screen.I'm surprised at how few people comment on the music. To me it is the most trite, tacky and clumsy part of the whole thing. Whenever we hear the theme that goes with the horrible song ""The heart will go on"" - which is often! - whatever mood James Cameron has managed to create is destroyed.

Our main characters Jack the poor artist and Rose the rich girl from the first class made us all cry even if we willing too recognize or not.Inn all lines the movie makes us think if we can go further after loosing the the most precious person in our life. We'll we can go on because life must goo on but it will remain in our hearts forever.With no doubt this is the best movie directed by James Cameron, among his other great achievements.

661,wittkecmission,A 7.8? Are you kidding me?,10,2 May 2016,"Titanic is my all-time favorite film. This film breathed life back into the Hollywood epic. Sadly, many people don't see it as an epic. They see it as a romantic chick flick that only focuses on the love story. But contrary to popular belief, the film focuses just as much on the ship as it does on the love story. It blends fact and fiction so well in a way that you rarely ever see on film. Movies like this are very easy to make, but there's very hard to make well and almost impossible to make great. It is also probably the most emotional moving film I've ever seen. It's the only movie that made me genuinely cry. It also has one of the important life morals: only life is priceless and making each day count. Although, I do have to admit that the dialogue is predictable and at times stilted. But that doesn't stop it from being a masterpiece. Because there is nothing in the film that I would improve, I'm giving it a 10/10 RATING.",Titanic
662,EJBaggaley,Iv seen better Titanic films,6,4 December 2004,"When I first saw this film, I absolutely loved it, as I got carried away with the fantastic special effects, good acting and great soundtrack. However, in order to realise what this film is truly about, you have to watch it at least twice in order to understand that this film is a load of ignorant and political nonsense. First of all, the storyline was completely ridiculous and unreal. The fact that a hoodlum vagrant like Jack Dawson(Leonardo Dicaprio) could possibly seduce a highly sophisticated lady such as Kate Winslet(Rose De Witt Bukater) is impossible. Having a fling with him is possible, but to have left her successful rich Fiancé Billy Zane (Caledon Hockley) for Jack Dawson would never happen in real life. Second of all, this film had untrue facts to what really happened at the Titanic tragedy and its main focus was to praise the Irish and to racistly put down the British. The fact that the British boat loader gunned-down the Irish hoodlum, never actually happened in history, as that man was a hero, not a murderer. Also, the fact that the British racistly locked the Irish in the third class section when the Titanic was sinking was untrue to the way it was portrayed. Yes, the third class section was probably locked up in the basement when the Titanic was sinking, however it was a class issue, not a racist issue. There were just as many European and British people in the third class section, as there were Irish and many Irish people in the first and second class section as well. So the fact that the third class people were locked up in the basement because they were Irish was completely nonfactual. Besides which, statistics show that more Irish people survived the Titanic disaster than any other nationality on that boat.Last of all, for James Cameron to write and direct a love story based on the Titanic tragedy is totally insensitive and disrespectful to the victims, family and descendants of the Titanic tragedy. There's nothing wrong with making a film based on the Titanic disaster, but to make a fictional romantic love story on the Titanic disaster is completely wrong. Whats next - James Cameron directing a romantic love story about a couple who fell in love in the New York Twin Towers(9/11) disaster on the day it collapsed, with people jumping out of windows (with heartfelt music in the background) and hitting the ground. Now that would be truly sick. Anyway, if you've never seen this film and would like to see it, I suggest you view it at least twice as that'll be the only way you'll truly understand the real meaning of the film.",Titanic

I think I liked it a lot when I first saw it in 97 (note: I only saw it ONCE at the theater), but now it's coming on HBO, like, every few hours. And when you catch the same parts playing over and over again you can tell how much you wish Cameron would've taken a few more writing classes when he was younger.The very best thing about Titanic was just that: The ship. The ship was the movie, and watching it sink was the real masterpiece of filming. Most of DiCaprio and Winslet's scenes together got tedious and was underwritten on some parts. It seemed like they were 90's people sent back in time to learn the ways of the early 1900's and failed to do so, which was exactly the case.I think Cameron is a great filmmaker, and am glad the movie was a success so that he cam bring us other movies. But, he I had wished he learned to be a better director and find out to make great movies without a colossal budget.

No, it's not worth a ten, but not so bad as to give it a zero.  Anyway, after watching it (on cable, not the big screen), I had to think about my feelings about it before commenting.  The obvious things have all been said: the bad script, etc. But what I was bothered by was the cinematography.  The use of filters and such was too prevalent.  I realize this was to diffuse the light and give everything a soft, antique-y look, but it bothered me nonetheless.I watch movies and ask myself, ""What does this scene add to the overall movie?""  In many cases with this film, the answer was ""Nothing at all.""  I understand the importance of establishing shots, but I don't see the need for them to be that long.  I got up once to go to the bathroom, and when I returned, it was still the long, sweeping, panoramic establishing shot! Ok, by this time I had figured out it was a big ship.I also didn't think the whole ""outside"" story set in the present was necessary, but I guess James Cameron wanted something to differentiate this story from all the other 'true love versus class struggle' stories.I do often get emotional at sad movies (hard for a guy to admit), but I didn't cry for this one, for whatever reason.

But I knew it had to happen, the ship hit that damned iceberg,. Fortunately, the film only got better.This is a fabulous film worthy of each Oscar that it received. The chemistry between the leads will never be matched. Personally I think Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio were made for each other. The supporting cast are excellent. The ship's builder, the captain, Molly Brown and of course Gloria Stuart in a sensational performance. But there is no denying it, this is James Cameron's film. His script has many flaws but his direction is flawless. This man knows every trick in the book and he pulls everything together. As a romance, as an action movie, as a historic drama it's a success. James Cameron is a wizard and he deserved his moment of narcissism at the oscars. Well done James!PS If you didn't see it at the cinema, wait until there is a cinema re-release.

I'll be quick.,8,23 July 2003,"Well I am finally getting a little sick of people bitching non stop about this movie, Why do I feel half of you that rag about it are doing so because for some reason it's become very trendy to bad mouth this movie. Then of course are the sudo-intellectuals that believe that movie + profit Crap. I'm not standing on my soapbox and proclaiming that this is the greatest movie of all time, because it isn't. I don't need for you love this movie or even like it, because everyone has there own opinions (see battlefeild earth, I thought that was REALY bad) However this movie still has merit.

671,krational,Kal,9,2 June 2020,"The night is as deep as the sea. I lie quietly on the bed and look at the Titanic. I don't know how many times I watched it. It seems that this has become a habit when I need to cry.
This time, I was moved by a villain named Karl. It always seems to hit the spotlight on the protagonist, Jack and Rose's love is undoubtedly sullen, every time he hates Karl for disrupting selfishness, wasting the chance of escape again and again on jealousy and conspiracy. From his perspective, I think I saw something new and wrote it out to share with you.
The first time was at the beginning of the film, he walked into Rose's room and saw the paintings she had collected. There is no doubt that he does not understand or care about art. He is a thorough businessman, even at the last moment of the film he is still a businessman. I looked at him and said with a smile, Rose liked these paintings, what Picasso or the like. It seemed to be full of disdain and mockery, but there was a bit of bitterness mixed in that mockery. He couldn't get into her world, he couldn't understand her, or art. He went on to say that she had to bring these paintings every time she went out. For the first time, I felt that maybe he didn't love Rose not only because he needed a glamorous and young wife, but also love. Although this love was also full of a strong merchant atmosphere, it was because he was powerless to change and unconscious. Arrived. If he just asked her to make the vase around him, then he would not care about her preferences, would not labor to bring her paintings with every trip, and would not understand her habits so much, because he cared about her.
Then, looking down, they went into the upper class as usual until he saw Jack, who saved Rose, on the deck. I don't know if it's too much of my heart. After his false thanks, I clearly saw his watchful glance at Jack, then turned around and embraced Rose immediately. The look was complicated and cold. He probably understood what was going on. Out of an instinctive vigilance, he felt that this person was different from Rose, so he didn't care about the gentleman's demeanor and was about to leave Luo ribbon here. When the crew proposed to give Jack some compensation, he invited him to dinner in the first class. Personally, he thought it was a little trick of love. He wanted him to be ugly, and hoped Rose could find him good by comparing with this poor boy, and The essence of the businessman is also the most vivid, he can thank him without paying a penny. I can't compare which of these two reasons is more important. The emotional and monetary factors are complicated. This is Karl.
However, things in the world often go against expectations. The more he wants to attack him, the more he wants to separate them, but instead promotes their inseparable life and death.
Next came the third-class cabin party. I have to say that Rose really did a little over here. Whether it is a man full of possessiveness, he can't bear his fiancee to openly go in pairs with another person on the ship. In full view, she took his hand and turned happily, hugging, like a pair of lovers. He still maintained his gentlemanly style, waiting for her to come at night, thinking that she would explain to him well, but instead of waiting for him, he not only waited for him, but she drank tea casually the next day and said, ""I'm too tired ""At that moment, he couldn't help it, he saw no sign of regret. When I saw him overturn the table, I felt that he was no different from any young man in love, young and impulsive. There is no proper way to save his woman. But this time he didn't touch Rose, he let his anger lie on the table, and silently warned her not to mess up.
And at night, he came to her again and took out the famous heart of the ocean. He was not an apology person, but he seemed to persevere by her side. He put a precious gem on her neck, which was a silent apology and weight. He was a businessman, and his apology was calculated. He gave her the gem in advance, and he just wanted to restore her heart. But he really didn't understand her. He also doesn't understand love.
The next thing got farther and farther away from his expectations. When he saw the painting, he just wanted to tear it off! However, the essence of the businessman made him come up with a conspiracy. He always wanted to get the most profit for the smallest price. As a result, he succeeded and Rose returned to him. He sent her to the lifeboat, but she eventually discovered his conspiracy and chose to go to the poor boy. He was almost mad and asked the servant next to him to find her. He still wanted to take her. He went back and took the necklace and money. Can you say he was selfish? Still smart?
Seeing that she was on the deck again, she was waiting to get on the lifeboat. She was still closely following him, still wearing his clothes. He was really dizzy and immediately forced her to put on his coat, but forgot that Diamonds. She refused to enter the lifeboat because of the poor boy. He was willing to lie and coax her into the boat at this time. I was moved by him at this moment. When he smiled and comforted her that I had arranged it, I promised you to take Jack away too. I think he really loves Rose. The only purpose of his lies is to coax her into the boat. Of course he knows what it means to get on the boat. When the two men in Rose's life looked at her on the railing and smiled goodbye to her, what was the difference between the two men? Their only moment of unification was for her life, and their only common denominator was loving her.
Rose finally chose to jump the ship, and when he died with Jack, Carl's last chance to board the ship was in front of him, but he gave up. We often only see Rose give up the boarding opportunity a few times and choose to be with Jack, but we don't see Carl do the same thing. Rose gave up twice and Carl gave up twice. Rose is for Jack, Carl is for Rose. In the end, he was young and full of emotions. He was finally stunned by jealousy and shot the pair of lovers. If his essence is so selfish and so cruel, how can he be so crazy? He really wished he could die with Jack. The bullets ran out, but none of them hit him. The expression that he was holding a gun but couldn't make a bullet was really desperate, so he gave up. In the end he found that the diamond was still given to her. In such an ironic way, he laughed and laughed at the drama of the matter. Laughing he could not hold either one, his two babies.
I've been thinking about what Karl finally found among the survivors, whether it was Rose or Diamond. Rose had loved him crazily. He had done a lot of impulsive stupid things for her. Diamond was also what he always missed, representing the merchant's breath in his bones. He was right, those were his two babies, two babies that were lost forever.",Titanic

673,shardy958855709,the technical boasting,7,18 October 2006,"watching this film on original release and the extended scenes is a must. To compare the differences. On the extended scenes you learn a lot more. It was commented on another site once about they went through Rose's story and no one said ""yeah this is all great Rose, but where is the diamond?""These should have been left in the film and maybe cut out a bit of the love story.In a documentary about the film, Mr Cameron says that anything to do with the ship is accurate. Fair enough he worked long and hard on it. But I'm sure anyone with basic maths would know that 17 1/2 knots is close to 20MPH (32KMH). Now again the basic maths at 20 Miles per hour, it would take less the Carpathia less than three hours to reach them not the quoted 4. Ill mention this part as well, yeah i should put these in goofs. The Carpathias top speed was only 14 1/2 knots. Numeroues other errors in the film. Mr Cameron, great film, loved it. But please get all the facts right.Also, last part. Why do American script writers writing stuff for English characters always think the English say the word ""bloody"" a lot????????",Titanic
674,KnowOne1988,You're So Stupid Rose,10,16 December 2009,"Titanic is a classic. I was really surprised that this movie didn't have a solid ten, overall in the IMDb user rankings. Maybe, it's just cool to not give Titanic credit nowadays, but when it was first made it was really something. When the movie came out people flocked to the theaters. When it came out on video my sister and i would watch it twice a day for a month. It was safe to say we were obsessed and for good reason. Some of the disaster scenes were hard to forgot, like the frozen baby, or the guy who committed suicide after killing someone in the unruly crowd. Many people died on that ship, and to convey that on film with the immediacy and emotion it needed is a hard challenge that James Cameron stepped up to. And let's not forget the amazing romance between Jack and Rose. Whether or not their relationship was a figment of someone's imagination it was lovely. They barely knew each other, but they would die for each other. They trusted each other. They sure as hell are giving Romeo and Juliet a run for their money. ""I'll never let go, Jack."" Titanic is a great film down to it's very core. It is a powerful story told through brilliant acting, excellent cinematography, beautiful music, and a crew full of hard and dedicated workers. It really blows my mind when someone says they hate this movie.",Titanic
675,roland-sinn,I love Titanic. Absolutely love it!,9,28 July 2003,"I love Titanic. Absolutely love it!It's a film about a magnificent machine; a triumph of human technology over environment that goes horrifically wrong when the masters of the machine become too prideful. Perfect film-making material!In some respects I'm surprised that it's taken so long to make a block buster film about the Titanic (I'm not counting the 1958's 'A Night to Remember' which was a fine film but hardly a big budget production). But with today's digital technology, it's been well worth the wait.
The faithful creation of the Titanic is the most intricately beautiful machine brought to the cinema screen, and James Cameron uses the film's human characters as camera guides to weave the audience through all the grand rooms and all the nooks and crannies of the immense ship. Brilliant, brilliant stuff!!As for the characters in the story  Handsome Jack, Lovely Rose, her brittle mother, her insidious fiancé, I love them all. Yes they are all representatives of class cliche from the era, but every single actor injects considerable life and genuine personality.As my tag line states: I'm a guy and I cried. It's very, very rare for me to cry during a film, but Titanic swept me off my feet. I've seen it twice on the big screen, twice on video, and caught it on TV two nights ago. Even though I had the intention of channel surfing, my heart and full attention were captured yet again by this magnificent, lavish film and I couldn't switch channels even during the ad breaks.Yes Titanic deserved every Oscar it won (and yet I'm as cynical about the Oscars as the next generation X dude). 9/10",Titanic
676,stephen_thanabalan_fans,Not even God himself needed to sink the 'Titanic',7,2 March 2006,"In 1912, humanity cried that ""Not even God himself could sink the Titanic"", the 'ship of dreams'; the indestructible symbol of mankind's modern achievements in maritime and industrialization. In 1998, celebrity cried that ""Not even God himself could sink the Academy awards and hyperbole of fame and recognition that was the film about the events 80 years earlier"".Well, look at it this way: Not even the divine and mighty God himself needed to sink the ship nor the film. Both the ship and its eponymous film representation sank after strong initial hype due to their paying comeuppance for pride and folly and getting found out of their own excesses in the long run. To begin with, the true story remains tragic because of the very fact that mankind overlooked, arrogantly so, the realities- failing to prepare (lifeboats a waste of deck space, class struggles, racism, rich & poor divides). In the end, mankind (regardless of whether the rich or poor caused the problems) paid the price of collective folly.The film, likewise, pays the price regardless of whether the executives who force-sold the distribution and caused the film to gain such unprecedented hype and reviews at first seemed so successful, really cared about more the bottom line. The film may have succeeded financially, but to me it still sank in the longer run. It made for a great emotional journey at first, but really, as we have to critique it at the level given its accolades, is nothing spectacular compared to something Capra-corn -'It's a Wonderful Life', which is emotionally powerful yet never gets cheesy.And, just like the real ship on her maiden voyage, it started off to controversy, followed by fanfare, and then tragedy. The reel version, nearly collapsed in budget controversy and then was bolstered by the biggest PR campaign complete with critics-wooing parties in the hopes of buying it around, thrusting the film as the most overpriced and embellished multi-million Hollywood machine- which turned off many and caused many more around the world to realize it for what it was- commercialism. Granted, that it's also a movie that because of its fame pervasive invasion on pop culture caused and still causes many to have an opinion about it (i.e. herd mentality discrediting/accrediting of the film along the lines of majority sentiment), I'll suggest that these ramifications of the film do not determine the film's genuine buoyancy. By buoyancy, I'm talking about the film's long term standing in the realms of other all time accredited films- the test if it really is a masterpiece.Of course, my entire dialogue here is based on the premise that because it swept awards, it has been rated a 'great film', of which I disagree with. I think the movie is found out upon repeat viewing, and I think even the majority of its fans (again remember to strip away the hype and the Leo Mania) don't really rate it as a great film per se. Plus, even here in the IMDb, why is the movie not recognized as a great film years after the initial awards fever? Because it has been found out over time for what it is- a decent film that stood out for its historical recreation (not facts in its entirety), and weaved alongside a trite love story on board the ship of fools, albeit being panoramic-ally beautiful. There are strong positives of course- special effects as well as sound and editing. But as you can see, they are all technical aspects, not in terms of classical film art.The film is a meticulous recreation and that is why I gave it 7/10, but it is not a GREAT film as say an intellectually challenging Fellini satirical commentary like 'And the Ship sails On'. It was panoramic-ally beautiful and had great costume design but it did not have, say, brilliant mise en scene that gives it nuance. In that sense, it is certainly not deserving of all of its accolades and accreditation.Nonetheless, I do not dispute its garnering gargantuan box office revenue worldwide as that was FOX's ultimate goal (even if Cameron had a personal crusade of sub-marine discovery). Essentially, when you wash away the DiCaprio mania (not to be discounted because it tied in substantial box office receipts), the hullabaloo of Oscar accreditation & aggressive marketing/advertising campaigns (successful from Bangkok to Rio DeJaneiro or HongKong might I add), you're left with a film that got found out as a victim of its own showy hype.Thus, film critics could never call it anymore than it was: popcorn fodder, and once teenagers outgrew their crushes, and people had witnessed the beautiful recreation of the ill-fated voyage that declared its pomp 80 years earlier, there was nothing left of this ship. It lies at the bottom of the sea save for nostalgic divers who yearn to return to their old sentiments, have issues to deal with or are disillusioned by the hype of past tragedy.Not even God himself needed to sink the ship or the film, there wasn't anything in it, unless people take the real message of what we can learn from Titanic: Respect God, be prepared, love and treat your fellow humans as equals, fight oppression, class segregation, battle the rich poor divide, celebrate freedom, and above all, to not get caught up in the excesses and hype of initial success. What we can learn from Titanic is that as pirated copies of the film are sold in Afghanistan or Cambodia by child slaves, the real tragedy in the world today is that we should focus not on the 1700 people who died, but turn our attention to the millions dying annually of inequalities. Marx or Kafka could probably tell us that you don't need God himself to remind us of that by sinking ships, and or, mass marketed popcorn billion dollar films.By Stephen Thanabalan",Titanic

That's just scratching the surface on how disgusted I was with this movie.  Particularly the script.  Why can't Jim Cameron just stick with the technical stuff he's so brilliant at?  Who told that clown he could write?  Moreover, who told him he could write dialogue?

680,jennifer-99,It's as if I was there...,10,21 December 2000,"To watch Titanic is not simply to watch a film about a love story on a sinking boat.....it is to experience the horrific tragedy as if you were on the ill fated voyage in 1912.  I marveled at Titanic's grandeur, I was inspired to dance by the rousing Celtic music at the ""3rd class party"", I felt their terror at the ship's impending demise, I despised the builders for the lack of life boats, I felt the mother's pain as she tucked her children in bed for the last time, I shuddered at the icy cold waters. Short of turning back the clock to 1912, this is the closest any of us are going to get to the ""Unsinkable Ship"".Mr. Cameron has done an impeccable job re-creating the Titanic and it was the effort that went into that alone which earned him the Oscars for Best Director and Best Picture.  The visuals were stunning from beginning to end and when watching the film on the big screen it truly was a sight to behold. As for the fictional part of the story, in spite of what many of the film's detractors had to say, I thought it was beautifully done.  DeCaprio and Winslet turned in brilliant performances and made the characters of Jack and Rose into people that we cared about.  We rooted for these star crossed lovers even though we all knew the fate of the ship.  I am not a fan of long movies and usually lose interest sometime after the second hour, but here the 3 plus hours simply flew by.  The movie draws you in and rivets you to the screen until the credits are rolled.  I can't remember a time where I have cried so earnestly for movie characters...not only for Jack and Rose, but for all the lost souls in the North Atlantic.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio perform well as the main characters of a love story backdropped by the sailing of the doomed vessel.  Kathy Bates is excellent as the ""Unsinkable Molly Brown,"" and Frances Fisher performs well as the arrogant, love-to-hate mother of Winslet's character.The special effects, including a near life-size replica of the ship, are great.

The effect is good but it still doesn't make the audience sit on the edge of their seats. The acting is dry, lacking any charisma and the result is like watching William Shatner for a few hours.

The Titanic is a legend, and it was an interesting idea to make a movie out of the true drama it was.  However, the poignant relationship between Jack and Rose failed to faze me at all; the whole ironic situation at the end affected me little.  I couldn't really empathize with such sappiness; I felt like the characters and even the whole 'tough love' story were unnecessarily cliche. Also, it took WAY too long.  Over an hour could have been cut while still making the point.

689,Delerium,Possibly the WORST movie of the decade.,1,23 May 1999,"Yeah, you heard right. Titanic, for all it's special effects, obscenely high budget, and no less criminal amount of critic acclaim, is nothing more than a big pile of rubbish. The ship sank, and sucked millions of dollars down with it.First of all, take away the special effects. What your left with is a third rate script. It attempts to mix a period piece with trendy, all too modern dialogue. I have doubts that ""The finger"" and the term ""Bum a smoke"" existed in 1912. You also get the most contrived love story in the history of motion pictures. There is no way Jack would have even been allowed near where Rose was. Also, I doubt that a girl like Rose, raised in a life of luxury and set to marry a billionaire, would be interested in a bum like Jack. The customs at the time would not have permitted it. What I also have a problem with is the cliches that this script banks on. It is always the rich people who are the villains, and the poor little popper is the hero who saves the day. The screenwriter must have no mind of his/her own.Second, the acting is horrible. Sorry ladies, it's no mystery why Leo wasn't nominated for an Oscar. But Leo can act, he has proven that in the past. But period pieces are not his strength (do I even need to mention ""The Man in the Iron Mask""?). Kate Winslet is the typical strong willed female character made to appeal to the feminists watching this movie. They might have had their feathers ruffled by the lines ""The real purpose of college is to meet a good man"", though. She is good, but one good performance in a sea of bad ones.James Cameron is not high on my list of favorite directors, and ""Titanic"" stands as the biggest stroke of his ego. Needless to say, I was disgusted by the ""Moment of silence"" he made at the Oscars. The only redeeming quality of ""Titanic"" is watching the ship sink, which fills the second half of this movie's grossly overlong running time. But it is hardly worth it. And the Best Picture Oscar, god! There is only one way I can say this, ""LA Confidential"" got screwed! As did ""Good Will Hunting"".To sum up, I found my 3 hours in the dentist chair last month more enjoyable than this piece of trash.

Come on folks do you really think Winslet would have fallen in love with baby faced DiCaprio in real life?

The dialogue left nothing to the imagination as it was trying so hard to stereotype everyone in this film.  Here's a clue; rich people are not all bad and poor people are not all beer-swilling drunkards.  The other stereotype you had was Jack the typical poor, starving artist.  Then you had Billy Zane the villain, who was I assume was supposed to act and look like Snidely Whiplash (dark hair, dark clothing) from a Dudley Doright cartoon.  I'm surprised they didn't put a moustache on him.  And let's not forget Rose's rich up-tight mother (the rich are all uptight and snobbish you know), who is automatically supposed to allow a gambling, low life, starving artist delve right into the family fortune. The effects were in fact good, but If you need your movie dialogue spoon fed to you, then this is the movie for you.",Titanic
694,Garys1266,Great film if you lack a college degree,4,27 November 2002,"This film must only appeal to a person with the mentality of someone who has gone as far as the 8th grade.  If you want to see real film watch Shawshank Redemption or the Godfather.  The dialogue in this film is an insult to anyone's intelligence who has went past high school education-wise.  The most terrible line in the film?  ""Jack I'm flying!!!""  I felt like saying great keep flying off of the bow of this ship so this movie will end, you obese sow.  This movie was very painful.  By the way, this film was and is not ""awesome"" or ""way cool"" as some have stated.  The approving comments below and their lack of grammatical accuracy, just proves that people who like this film are trailer trash who do not have a good grasp on the king's English.",Titanic

Was the American public asking itself ""Well I love cliched tragic love stories, and I love cliched stories with lots of WATER in them, why can't they combine the cliches of tragic love and water into one bloated, overblown blockbuster?""I myself never pondered this question, and thus I did not enjoy Titanic.",Titanic
696,fwgrhouse,I was Touched,10,9 June 2006,"When I was in the third grade I learned about the Titanic. The moment after I first heard of it, I immediately got interested in it. Then awhile later, I heard of the movie. I wanted to see it, so I rented it and watched it with my parents (they already saw it so I knew how it ended) and when it was done, I was crying. I'm 15 right now and when I see it I still at times hold back tears. I couldn't imagine anyone who wouldn't be touched by this. The plot is excellent, the actors play the roles very well, and the special effects are excellent. It also shows that the disaster could have been less tragic if they put more lifeboats and put more people in them. This is a film which is a defenet must-see film.",Titanic
697,q-85184,Eternal love,8,11 April 2020,"I think that although the film focuses on love, it also reflects the ugliness of class relations
When the Titanic was about to sink, almost all the opportunities for survival were reserved for the aristocratic class. The poor could only pray for the rest of the ship to give their children or face death silently
This is a criticism of the ruling class of that era and a satire that the poor and the rich were treated differently",Titanic
698,Motorskallen,Sure I cried ...,1,14 July 2005,"But NOT because the movie is an oh, so tragic story about two young lovers and a boat sinking in the sea. But because of one person - ONE PERSON ONLY - spent about a billion dollars on this movie (while about a billion human beings can't get food for the day, a house to sleep in or clean clothes) and didn't succeed to make a great movie. Three hours is how long this was. That's at least about two and a half hour too much. One thing if it they spent the money on a documentary on the subject, or at least spent the money on better boats, but not on this awful movie. The silly plot, ridiculous jokes, bad actors, an unoriginal subject ... What more can I say? O yeah - it has great special effects! ""But that's at least something!"" you might say! NO - IT'S - NOT! It's just another problem. Because special effects are not all, and if they had to spend money on special effects, they could at least have made a greater movie. I hope the producers and the director will spend the rest of eternity in hell, watching this movie. Over and over again.",Titanic
699,Aldri7,aging well,8,22 April 2008,"So much has been said about ""Titanic"" , pro and con, I doubt I can add much to the discussion. I am one of those that has seen it numerous times (at least a dozen) and watching it now is a lot like putting on a comfortable old shoe. The nostalgic quality of the film was always a big draw for me anyway, and now, seeing it again brings on a sort of ""double nostalgia"" i.e. a nostalgia both for the movie itself as well as for the time period in which it took place. We all know who Rose was or rather who she represented. She was the ""Miss Liberty"" that appeared on all the coins of the era, and whom also was the inspiration or model for the Statue of Liberty. At the moment she proclaimed her freedom in the movie, in fact, she traded her tight corsets for the same free flowing gown worn by those early feminist icons. I think a lot of people missed that point and instead took to making negative comments about her weight, etc as though an actress with a super model bod would have done a better job of projecting that Miss Liberty persona. Anyway, the more I see the movie now, the more I love both the old Rose and the Kate Winslet Rose. Young Rose wasn't an overly strong person through much of the movie, but that to me was consistent with the types of relationships she was in. I can see some wanting a sexier Rose, while others, a stronger and more assertive one. But to me, the balance was just about right as it had to be for the movie to succeed.Otherwise, there are many other things I still marvel at while replaying this movie over and over again. For example, nine times out of ten, long movies suffer from problems related to pacing and holding the audiences attention. But Titanic's ""take it slow"" approach was in my mind a stroke of genius, not a fault, and the pacing was magnificent in the first half (pre iceberg). Paradoxically for me, the second half of the movie actually contained some of the ""slowest"" scenes, with ""slow"" being a relative term tied to one's expectations. And then there is DiCaprio's Jack, and my only lingering regret with regards to this movie. Maybe I was wanting Matt Damon for the role. I don't know. But Jack's mix of humble roots and Paris sophistication was just too hard for me to swallow. It reminded me of how super sophisticate Hawkeye Pierce of ""M*A*S*H"" was actually from.......Crabapple Cove, Maine? This is Hollywood wanting to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. Jack did have to be an artist, though, because that was central to the plot. But his humble roots was to me just a case of ""balancing the ticket"" politically, so to speak, and was irrelevant otherwise. Anyway, Titanic is still a beautiful and moving film to me. Sure, I might have toned down the cheesy aspects of the romance and cast a more mature and believable Jack, but the real achievement here lies elsewhere. People use terms like ""timeless"" and ""enduring"" when describing movies such as this, and yes they are clichés. But when applied to a historically based film they have real meaning. Implicit is the requirement that such a film span generations and appeal to filmgoers from across the decades. Titanic accomplished this beautifully in a unique and powerful way. As serious historical epics go, I suppose this movie will never be a heavyweight. But yet it still has that power to endure in one's psyche - almost as much as the original disaster may have endured in the memories of those that experienced it first hand.",Titanic
700,Edd-N-Furter,A misjudged masterpiece,10,30 April 2012,"When Titanic was released for the first time back in 1997 it became a cultural phenomenon: for 12 years it was the highest grossing film in history, winner of 11 Academy Awards, turned Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet into huge movie stars and made My heart will go on sung by Celine Dion a romantic anthem.However, with the passing of the years being a fan of Titanic became the equivalent of having bad taste and poor judgment in films. I personally disagree with this highly subjective assessment, since Titanic is the best example of how to make a sweeping epic like those that used to be made in Hollywood's golden age.Thus, James Cameron uses the tragic sinking of the ship that ""not even God could sink"" to tell the already iconic love story between Rose DeWitt Bukater, the American girl betrothed to a steel tycoon whom does not love and Jack Dawson, the aspiring artist who has traveled the world in search of his identity becomes a desperate struggle to survive once the ship hits an iceberg and is destined to sink. This aspect of the movie has always been criticized, as Cameron chooses to tell a fictional story instead of focusing on one of the many true stories of the passengers; this is a risky decision that pays off due to Cameron's ability to associate reality and fiction respecting the historical perspective, the chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet and the unexpected sensitivity with which Cameron tells a love story (something unusual for him, given his previous experience in science fiction movies), it could even be said that without Jack and Rose the film wouldn't have had the same impact and success.This does not diminish at all the impressive historical recreation not only of the Titanic (for which an almost exact replica of the original boat had to build), but the period in general, and this is not limited to costumes and scenery, but also in the notes on the differences between social classes existing in the early twentieth century and decadence disguised as opulence, which unfortunately have not changed much today.The sinking of the Titanic has been told numerous times in film and on TV, but James Cameron's version has become the obligatory reference, not only for the reasons already mentioned, but also for the incredible realism and technical accuracy this is portrayed achieving really shocking moments and scenes of high emotional impact that are not quite successful on other versions and that make us partakers of such tragedy as if we were watching it live. This is due to the use Cameron makes of digital technology without being overwhelmed by it, since he understands that digital effects must serve the story and not vice versa.Special mention to the brief but poignant appearance of Gloria Stuart as old Rose, who serves as the narrator of the story, and gives consistency to the story as well gives it humanity and warmth.Titanic has not only withstood the test of time but also the unflattering trials of those who call themselves connoisseurs of good cinema and remains one of the greatest epic films ever made.",Titanic
701,RJ-21,worst movie ever made,1,26 November 1998,"I've seen some shockers in my time, but this excuse for a film takes the cake.  I had some respect for Cameron and Winslet before this one, but all that was ruined by Titanic.  Easily the Academy's biggest mistake of recent years, and certainly the aforementioned film stars. (I had little respect for DiCaprio, however, so he isn't tainted any more) Billy Zane must have been desperate, as even if he's not the best actor around, he's still a popular choice for me. A script that couldn't have been recycled into toilet paper, combined with bad acting and a bad story make Titanic a disaster, rather than a disaster movie.  For a good romance, check The Princess Bride, and for disaster, see a good war movie - try Gallipoli.",Titanic
702,JCR-4,Much better than I expected,9,25 October 1999,"As usual, I didn't get caught up in the hysteria and watch this film when it came out, instead waiting for the film to arrive on TV.  I must say, I expected trash and instead was profoundly affected by the film.  I thought the acting was very good, a good performance from Di Caprio, and Kate Winslet was positively gorgeous.  I see many commenters say they observed closely Di Caprio's acting and didn't like it, but why watch a film to ""observe"" the acting?  Acting is good when you don't notice it's acting.  A script is good when you don't notice any bad lines.  If you look specifically for things then you'll watch a film in an artificial manner and find all sorts of things.  Titanic is to be enjoyed, for many reasons.  The romance is sublime, the special effects are dazzling, the way classes were treated so differently is shocking, the tragedy of seeing those passengers perish is haunting and stayed with me for a couple of days afterwards.  All in all Titanic is a powerful film, well directed, and for me, deserved many of the oscars it received.  For once the hollywood blockbuster movie was worth the millions spent on it.",Titanic
703,Glaschu,"Inane Script, Unconvincing Characters",1,29 August 1999,"Hmm, I wonder what happened at the end? I must have watched 6/8 of this film before washing the dishes seemed a more appealing chore. Many actors can perform convincingly in period films, but this cast did not convince me at all that they were anything but 1990s actors with 1990s dialog trying to look like people from the 1910s. The script was inane, leaving the viewer with only special effects for interest. In the very-near future, when high-tech special effects no longer dazzle audiences, this moneymaking venture will be re-evaluated. I'll give it a 2/10 in order to be fair to the special effects staff, who clearly labored the hardest on this film and deserve some credit.",Titanic
704,Sheepi,9/10 movie,9,29 November 1999,"I voted a 9/10, partly because the romance DID drag on a bit too long. The ship didn't hit the iceberg until 1 1/2 hours through the movie. After seeing this movie 3 times in the theatre, I was very bored with it, but reluctantly bought it on tape anyways. It CAN be considered a masterpiece, however. The acting was very good. The story could have used several improvements to keep it more interesting.After the ship hit the iceberg, things got exciting. This was the part of the movie I really enjoyed. Those who didn't see it in the theatre can never get the real feel of the movie, when the screams are blasting at you, it was exciting.If you haven't seen this movie yet, I suggest you rent it and sit down, at least through the boring first part, until the ship starts sinking and it gets interesting.",Titanic
705,mules82,good god...,2,8 November 2002,"Warning!!!!  Spoilers!!!!  To an extent, though this movie sucks so I'm doing you a favor.Titanic puts the 'retard' in 'retarded.'  Easily one of the top 5 worst movies of all time.  Anyone who cried at the end of this film should immediately try and start beef with LW, better known as twin glocks. Tasting the cold steel through your medula would be a much better option than continuing with your pathetic existence.  This movie was not funny at all, the lead female was morbidly obese and the hero was the homeless vagrant from Growing Pains, I assume Alan Thicke was too busy hosting episodes of Pictionary to be available for the movie.  Anyway, how this trite piece of garbage made money is beyond me.  The whole movie was pointless so I'll just cut to the end, the only remotely funny part.  The kid from Growing Pains is freezing his nuts off in the water while his fat beast girlfriend is floating on some wooden raft all warm and comfy.  There is easily enough room for the two of them, however, she refuses to let him on.  I bet that kid never saw this coming when he was living in that Janitor's closet on Growing Pains before the Seavers took him in.  Anyway, the Growing Pains guy eventually dies, however, instead of floating on the surface like all the other corpses in the water, the Growing Pains hobo for some reason sinks to the bottom.  While all this is happening the fat girl is crying, I don't know why.  She clearly could have saved him by just moving over a few inches and sharing a bit of the raft.  Perhaps she just misplaced her twinkies.  Anyway she struggles to blow some whistle then some British guy saves her, the end, this movie was atrocious.",Titanic

709,demondrink,James Cameron has lost it big time,3,27 August 2002,"A tragic story. And not in the sense that it made me cry. This film is pathetic. The love story is tedious, the depiction of Irish peasantry panders to the crassest stereotypes and Celine Dion's stinky theme song is just the icing an a horrible anti-cake. Somewhere along the line, around about Terminator 2 and True Lies, director James Cameron went badly astray. He became so obsessed with setting new Special Effects standards that he lost sight of characters, dramatic plausibility and any measure of emotional honesty, which are all far more essential to a film's credibility. The characters in this film are bland and uninspiring. To call them one-dimensional would be an insult to Geometry.It's ironic that a film which cost so much to make in terms of special effects should go for the cheapest possible emotional return - Billy Zane is his usual camp, pantomime-villain self, Leonardo DiCaprio is as wet as the sea he eventually (thankfully) drowns in and even the usually reliable David Warner is flat and listless. This film gets three out of ten. And all those points are for the last hour when the ship sinks - the only good part of the film. The rest of it should be consigned to the bottom of the Atlantic and left there to rot.",Titanic
710,marcusedenellis,Exceptional Film Making,10,15 August 2006,"It is a bit late in the day for me to be offering a critique of Titanic - especially given that there are so many eloquent and knowledgeable reviews already posted here. However, I would like to offer my retrospective view of this film after having just re-watched the piece and the alternative endings on the special DVD release.I was enthralled with Titanic when I saw it at the cinema and I was equally captivated when I watched it again on the video release. What struck me more than anything else was the sheer passion for the project displayed by director James Cameron. I had been a huge fan of Cameron and his body of work leading up to Titanic; he seems to be a filmmaker who truly understands that blockbusting, crowd pleasing cinema is just as vital and has as much integrity as small independent and more cerebral films. An unfashionable view, I guess, but blockbusters with a bit of soul are possible! Clearly Cameron invested a great deal of time, energy and resource investigating the doomed Titanic and the circumstances surrounding her demise. The lengths to which he and his crew went, to re-create events, locations and fittings faithfully can only be applauded. When you read the Goofs section here, it seems almost a shame to pick holes in an otherwise superbly crafted film. Also, let's not forget that Cameron is a truly technically innovative film maker; his early use of CGI lacks some of the seamlessness that we now expect, but back then it was truly jaw dropping.Cameron is a director of huge quality but he is also a man that seems to divide opinion. Some people seem to hate him and cite his egotistical cry of ""King of the World!"" at the Oscars as justification for this (although he was clearly just paraphrasing his Jack Dawson character and letting the world know how he felt, not who he thought he was). He is also, apparently hard work on set; but let's face it, what perfectionist isn't hard work? I am one of those who think that Cameron makes fine, entertaining, spectacular and thoughtful films and he should be thanked for that.Titanic is majestic cinema that delivers a romantic story against the backdrop of probably the most famous and resonant maritime disaster of all time. The plot is admittedly slight, but when you have the drama of the sinking of Titanic  how much plot do you need? One of the nice things about the DVD is that you can see the alternative ending where old Rose shows Bill Paxton the Heart of the Ocean diamond, which is what I really wanted to happen when I first saw the film  because the crew of the salvage vessel had some doubts about her story. I found this incredibly satisfying  so if you haven't seen it, check it out.Overall, looking back over the decade that has passed since its first release, Titanic had stood the test of time. It is an exceptional film executed in style by a singular and forward thinking director. The only downside that I can see it that it probably exhausted Cameron and took him off in other directions  his output has been pretty woeful in the intervening years. Hopefully Avatar will be a marvel! 10/10",Titanic
711,j-jessie-weaver,The Most Wonderful Movie Ever to Grace This Planet... Period,10,31 October 2012,"James Cameron's ""Titanic"" is just one of those movies I can watch all day and never get sick of. When it comes on television, I watch it immediately. There is simply nothing bad about this film that'll make you want to hate it.Every scene from ""Titanic"" from start to finish is fantastic; the love scenes to the final moments. You'll find yourself getting way into the plot, as well as feeling for the characters.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are brilliant as Jack and Rose. Once they enter the picture, you cannot help but love any moment they spend together, and their ""forbidden"" romance is so emotional and powerful.The ship's final moments will keep you on the edge of your seat as well as shock you. James Cameron does an excellent job of recreating the sinking. It's hard to imagine that a horrible incident like this happened 100 years ago. Cameron marvels at bringing the disaster to life.On the whole, ""Titanic"" is a wonderful movie. Nothing can describe the sheer greatness coming out of it. If you haven't seen it, I strongly suggest you give it a try.MY RATING: 10 out of 10.",Titanic
712,Caesarboy5,"Titanic and Avatar: Two Films Hated Because of ""Simple"" Plots",9,24 December 2013,"Titanic and Avatar are very different. One is about a forbidden love aboard a doomed ship. The other is about humans trying to exploit an alien race in order to profit. Yet both have something very similar in common: they are criticized for having unoriginal stories.Titanic is a love story about a doomed couple. People complain that it's been done before (Romeo and Juliet) and that it's boring. They only enjoy the second half which consists of everyone dying. I'm here to say that is an unfair call.THE GOODThere's nothing wrong with an unoriginal story, as long as the execution is good. After all, we're running out of original stories. Even Shakespeare had a tendency to take other people's stories. He just told them really well. So, is Titanic well executed? yes, on the most part. While it does have it's flaws, I think the bulk of the film is amazing. It's well paced, the characters are well-developed, the cinematography is awe-inspiring, and the conflict is one that continues to exist today (people being forced into loveless relationships due to different pressures). Like Romeo and Juliet, this film is a classic.THE BADThis is a nitpick. Cameron decided to make the film as if an older Rose is telling a captain the story via flashback. That's fine and it works well the entire film. But the ending is just rushed and not much of a lesson like ti should have been. The Captain of the submarine crew should have disposed of the Heart of the Ocean, not Rose. That way it would show Rose's lesson got through to someone. Why even introduce the Captain and a conflict if they're just going to be forgotten at the end of the film.Once again, a nitpick, but the movie is three hours. Why is the ending so rushed? I just wished they could have gave the future part of the film a more satisfying ending.VERDICTGreat film, 9/10, see it!

713,snagssharkteeth-23785,A division of morality,10,30 December 2018,"I see little point in being the two thousandth six hundred and nineteenth person in reviewing this movie but why not? I saw this movie on its release, being a ten year old child I was more concerned about seeing a young naked female than watching fifteen thousand five hundred and three people die.Such a movie was shut away in the back of my small silly mind and revived on the odd occasion through out my life. Over all I presumed this movie had little to no impact on my life until I realized it inspired my artistic talent.That mysterious picture of Rose was set in my mind from a very young age and inspires me to this day along with the other pictures in Jacks portfolio. Anyone with an artistic flare would know what I am talking about.Later on in life I presumed this movie was a propaganda piece and took less care to even notice it. Until I took notice.
It became evident that this movie portrayed two peoples exceptionally well, the rich and the poor.
That was the division and a sad one at that.
Its easy to focus on the love life of Jack and Rose but easier to focus on the indignation of the rich and poor and I think the movie might of underplayed that.
Which is acceptable.Its easy to say the movie was a tragic one but its easier to say it represents a heart of darkness and it is that darkness that makes one cry.
Its extremely well filmed. The filmography is brilliant, the music enumerates and over all the entire film compliments itself each second.There was a dispensation in film making of peak performances, this era seemed to last less than twenty years, this film was filmed during it,",Titanic

None of them are on my favourites list, not even this one, but there was a definite style or quality that I just can't put my finger on. It;'s like my fascination with director Jan De Bont(Twister). He doesn't make the best films on Earth, but he could do if he opens up a little more, or if he stops trying to be cool. I believe this is also where Cameron faulters.He said his goal with this film was ""to show the world the Titanic's brief and glorious life as well as the tragic irony"". In my opinion, his goal was to convince people that what he had created was ""the best movie ever made"" and he succeeded. I thought this was a ""good"" film but not ""the best"" film. People have just become zombies when they were led to believe this.I will say this loud and clear: I do not like Leo. I also believe that he, like Cameron, is a fad that people have fallen for and not seen through. No wonder they worked together on this film. Leo too could be a great actor, if he would just let go of his egotistical nature and ""cool boy"" attitude.Yes, all I'm really complaining about in this film are: the director, and the lead actor. The rest, I thought, was phenomenal. The visual effects(I couldn't compare them to anything else that year), the impressive acting, the sets, the costumes, the inspired plot(telling an untold and deliberately fictitious story about the Titanic and what could have happened had it not been for the iceberg), and many more technical and psychological aspects. Cameron obviously wanted several life issues featured in this film(i.e., class and social standing, hope, placing too much confidence in one thing and recieving nothing from it). This I believe he achieved. I thought his cover-up goal of telling the story of what happened before the Titanic sank was achieved, but his other goal, creating the best film ever, was not.This never should have won best picture at the Oscars. It never should have won even half of the awards at the Academy Awards ceremony. I believe it only won those awards because there was nothing better that year(Good Will Hunting, As Good As It Gets, L.A. Confidential, The Full Monty, all were not worthy of the Best Picture role, in my opinion).

It was a very interesting account of the lives of two central people aboard the Titanic, one of the worst disasters in history.  The real excitement hit when the boat hit the iceberg.  The movie kept my attention from then on out.  Many people say that this movie is the best movie ever created.  I beg to differ.  In my opinion, the best movie ever made is Gone With the Wind.  You just can't compare to such an epic.  Titanic doesn't even come close.  When you really boil the movie down, it merely is a dressed up romance with an action/adventure tagged onto it.

I wish I could continue further, but I have to sum up the point: this so-called film is actually a machine whose sole function is to churn out money and more money. Sadly, it succeeded.",Titanic

Now the people thinks about Kate Winslet or Leonardo DiCaprio, some even think about James Cameron. And some just think of the movie itself. But is not the Titanic anymore, is the movie of Titanic. People knows better Titanic than even Gone with the wind. It was just a great social event. Some people loved it! Enjoyed the great direction of James Cameron, with the beautiful soundtrack of Mr Horner, and the great visual effects reconstructing the terrible event of the Titanic. Some other people thought it was another stupid romantic film (the lovers of Van Damme thought so) and some just hated it because of Leo! (jealousy reasons? they will not recognize, they'll just say he is the worst actor they ever seen (not true!)). What is for sure is that nobody got out of the movie theater without an opinion. I have to say that not much directors could do what Mr Cameron did. But we should congratulate them, and we should congratulate each actor.Oh, I just think that if James Cameron can make sink the Titanic again! He should have taken care that Kate Winslet and Mrs Stuart don't have the same color eye. So you can see that one has blue eyes and the other has brown eyes! Well, if you haven't seen it yet. Congratulations! Not much people can say so!",Titanic

And a lot of people don't want to admit that they actually enjoyed it. But, alas, I am certainly not one of those people. I thought the movie was a beautiful testament to the power of true love. And for those of you that thought this love story was corny, fake, or unreal, than you obviously haven't yet experienced the feeling. Leonardo DiCaprio, in the role that made him super-famous, was fantastic, even though it was not the best role in either of the main actors career. Kate and Leo are absolutely my favorite actors. The supporting cast did an excellent job, especially Billy Zane and the fabulous Kathy Bates. Oh, and one more thing...I wish that people would stop with the age-stereotypes on this film. So many people say that only teenage girls would like this ""crappy"" movie. I'm sorry, but that is untrue. When you say that, it is like you are saying that teenage girls are immature and only went to see this because of Leo. I take offense to that. Age is a number, not what determines whether of not you like a film. I am a teenage girl, but if you have read any of my comments, you'd realize that I am most certainly not immature.

728,manalone923,"Why I like this film, as a longtime student of the actual Titanic",10,29 January 2004,"A fellow reviewer wrote earlier that Titanic is among his or her favorite films, and sometimes people laugh. I myself laugh, not at the movie but at that statement. I echo what the reviewer said, which is that at the time, almost everyone loved the movie or at least recognized good stuff about it. It was critically acclaimed, made more money than any movie in history, and received uncountable awards including the most Oscars ever, tied with Ben Hur at 11 wins.Now, I shake my head when I see that Titanic currently has a rating of about 6.7.  Jeez people, view a movie for how it is rather than how oversaturated it got!!!And that's the problem. Titanic WAS a very good movie- and since I was interested in the actual ship a decade before the movie was made, hopefully I can tell you why I support it. The technical achievements alone were grand, the scale of the movie was epic and moving, and to James Cameron's credit, it was almost 100% accurate to the many different details of the Titanic legend. Of course, to accept this one has to ignore the fact that the main characters are fictitious amalgams of real Titanic passengers.Those two characters are Jack Dawson and Rose Buttaker, played of course by the leads Dicaprio and Winslet. Their awkward meeting and subsequent falling in love is played against the oncoming disaster, which, as everyone should know, happened 4 days into the ship's first voyage. At 11:40pm on April 14, 1912, the Titanic hit an iceberg and sank 2 and a half hours later.Now for the movie itself. The acting, although passionate, is goofy at times due to a script that was much maligned as being stereotypical and bland. I don't hate it that much, it doesn't sound too far off from what people are like when they're stupid in love. However, my problem arises here: Rose seems to be witty and independent, yet she becomes a doe-eyed child when she falls for Jack, who seems to know the answer to everything and even needs to heroically command Rose to ""get back"" when the iceberg comes by. More and more their relationship turns from possible to downright one-dimensional, as Jack becomes a grand hero and Rose becomes a helpless damsel. Granted, each character has scenes where they betray that limit (Rose in fact saves Jack's life at one point), but that's an exception to the rule. Another problem is that, quite simply, a relationship between a first class woman and third class male is possible, although entirely improbable. People just weren't that open minded in 1912, although for this movie it doesn't seem too severely hard to swallow.That having been said, I don't have much of a problem with the rest of the movie. This is because it stays admirably close to the facts, and pays insane amounts of detail to each scene. Director Cameron was in fact often joked about due to his fierce, almost anal commitment to the details. The ship looks real, because most of it is. The band played until the very end, which they really did. The ship indeed broke in half at the 2nd funnel, and if you look close, the iceberg scrape actually dots and dents the ship's hull instead of tearing a solid gash, as it actually did in real life. Although the 1958 Titanic film ""A Night to Remember"" had no fictitous characters and sticks religiously close to what really happened, James Cameron's Titanic is technically the most accurate, especially due to the breaking of the ship which wasn't proven until after the former film was made. A couple technical slips do get by, such as a terrible blue screen effect seen when the drunken baker is standing atop the risen stern (just before the final sinking). There's a shot of victims rolling down the upright stern section near the end, and we can see one of them bounce off of the cylindrical capstans, obviously a soft prop. But hey, these are just gaffes in an otherwise very good technical achievement.In closing, I still like this movie, as I did when it first came out (though not nearly as much now, after a dozen viewings). It has a lot of emotional impact, it stays very, very close to the actual facts, and it can even be argued that although fictional, Jack and Rose are just an example of what really happened to many of the couples on the real ship when it went down. I don't think a better movie about the Titanic can be made, although the aforementioned ""Night to Remember"" is also extremely good and in many ways just like James Cameron's film. If you see Titanic, the film, for what it tried to achieve, you can see that it is in fact a well made and successful film. I know it's hard to get past the negativity that its oversaturation caused, but at its heart I think it is an excellent movie.",Titanic
729,jezre_17,"THE BIGGEST SHIP OF ALL TIME, the weakest acting of all time.",10,7 May 2004,"TITANIC is absolutely a terrific mega production. It's visually perfect, the special effects are terrific, the score from James Cameron is by far unforgettable, the costumes are awesome, the sound effects are spectacular, and the acting is just the opposite. It wasn't a surprise that TITANIC got all the OSCARS but the acting ones.
I have to say that this movie is really clever, because is not all about TITANIC the ship, is about the forbidden love story of Rose De Witt Bukater and Jack Dawson, and how they fall in love in this terrible tragedy.
The love plot is very predictable and while you are seeing it is not much like other James Cameron Productions, besides I found annoying at times the acting between the very hot Kate Winslet and the fake Leonardo DiCaprio. It's not a believable relation, for me it looks false, and being 1:30 seeing this relation developing it's kind of boring. However not all is bad, the characters of Molly Brown, Calvert, Captain Smith, Rose's mother, and even Fabrizzio and Tommy are perfectly performed.The sinking sequence is one of the most incredible and realistic scenes I've ever seen in a movie; it's really impressive what James Cameron and all his crew achieved, it's the best dramatic, thrilling, disturbing and realistic sequence that has ever been made.This movie was really daring, and its PG-13 rate was really criticized, and with absolutely right, because contains brief frontal nudity, (YOU CAN SEE KATE'S BOOBIES, MMMMM), one use of strong language (`..and his f***ing hand, sorry his hand'), some sexuality (`You are trembling.hoo haa') and disturbing disaster situations (Lady holding her son and repeating him: `It'll be over soon', or Tommy being shot by Mr. Murdock).I would've give it an R, but who cares, this movie is going to be remembered as the movie that more money $$$$$$ has earned. 9/10",Titanic

In some ways this movie is also a tribute to the power of memory and means so much more than is seen on the surfce. The cast was well picked, I cannot think of any actor or actress who would have played the roles better. James Cameron did an impecible job of being detail oriented when it came to the true events that took place in 1912. Additionally, the movie was so well done that while watching, it feels as though you are transported to the actual event. MASTERPIECE",Titanic
731,Cal-5,An incredibly beautiful film,9,29 July 1998,"In Titanic the story is secondary to the film's fantastic photography and incredible visual effects. Titanic is easily one the most beautifully photographed films ever.

Leonardo DiCaprio delivers the best performance in the film, while Kate Winslet does a good job with the little bit her character is given.",Titanic
732,Laner,"Better than average movie, could have been great.",6,7 December 1998,"Let's get the negative out of the way... DiCaprio and Winselt are akin to a Boston Terrier and a Golden Retriever.  They really needed a more masculine lead for the love story to be convincing (but then that would have cut into ticket sales for the 13-19 female demographic, right?)  Anyway, one other thing that bothered me was unevenness of the dialogue.  Winselt's dialogue seems to jump from Victorian to Gen X somewhere during the halfway point; the merging of 90's attitude with a pre-WWI setting bothered me in general (language, cursing, general attitude of some of the characters, etc.), not to mention the way Cameron manipulates the audience against Billy Zane's character, who really has done nothing wrong until he whips out a gun near the end (wouldn't *you* be mad if your fiance was carousing around with some strange guy days before your wedding?  Me too).  And what was the deal with ""old Rose"" throwing the diamond off the ship?  That made absolutely no sense to me.With all that said, the overriding message of the movie (which was summarized in Jack's speech at dinner) is a good one, the storytelling is well done for the most part, and the special effects are awesome (with the exception of one or two scenes)",Titanic

Winslet has exactly one facial expression, deCaprio is much too '90s to be convincing as a 1912 roustabout, and neither of them made me believe they were passionately in love, which makes most of their actions in the last hour look simply brainless if not suicidal.

I just wish Cameron wouldn't have given in to the studio and have a soap-like story wrapped around the ship, and even worse, have the two main characters in it played by two shallow actors, who were clearly beyond their skills.

I know there are heaps of flaws and some serious narrative ambiguities, but actually I don't really care because I found it 3 hours of absorbing and completely magical storytelling.James Cameron does a fantastic job with Titanic. He makes wonderful use of the film as medium - no other visual art can offer the grandeur and breathtaking sweeps of imagery that film does. The effects are simply riveting, and emotionally wrenching. I loved the story of Rose and Jack. They were alive and had great depth and believability. Kate Winslet was magnificent and so was Gloria Stuart. Leo di Caprio did seem a bit too modern but his Jack was sympathetic and interesting. The supporting cast was excellent.The script does require a fair bit of cooperation from the viewer in terms of believability, but this can be done by people who don't try to put 'historically accurate' and 'film' in the same sentence. They don't go together. Never have and never will. Film is fantasy, escapism and a willingness to suspend one's life in order to live another for a few hours. Titanic does this superbly. It deserved every Oscar it received.And it's simply wonderful storytelling. Like Star Wars (the original not that hideous travesty TPM), it is the best of popcorn genre.

Then you give those actors lines to speak that are so badly written they might have been written by a 13-year-old girl trying to emulate a Harlequin romance.Despite wonderful production values and a serviceable story line, ""Titanic"" may be painful to the ears of anybody who is fully literate. Why did James Cameron spend so many millions to make a film and not spend an extra ten grand to have a competent editor look at his script?

We have two intersecting story, the Titanic and Rose. Titanic sunk by arrogant. Rose, the leading lady, revived through her spirit with the help of Jack, the leading man. The movie started in the present with the explorer digging the Titanic wreckage for treasure. We met the old Rose as she visited the explorers to help identify a drawing. she helped us worked our way into the past with the back story romance between her and Jack.The young Rose who was unhappy with her routine life was an engaged socialite. Her engagement was forced upon by her mother. Jack was a poor wanderer who won his way onto Titanic. They met at the Titanic bow one a night when Rose was considering suicide. Jack and young Rose took up much of the movie. Their story not only serve as the back story, but our tour guide of Titanic, to get our feel for Titanic before its fateful tragedy. Jack and Rose are two very uplifting people. I found their behavior interesting to watch. Jack is kind of representation of an everyday man, the many immigrants who landed in America in the early 1900s. He had a speech during a dinner, which he was invited to first class, covered it all.Rose was tied down by tradition. Titanic, that is the people who own Titanic, was overwhelmed with arrogance. There was a struggle between the two extremes. She was saved by meeting half way with a sacrificial help of Jack. No drastic changes without some kind of sacrifice. The future of shipping is saved by the sinking of Titanic with the sacrifice of the victims.As the story unfolded, the explorer understood that the Titanic is more than a gold mine. The audience understand the value of Titanic. The back story helped us understand the importance of Titanic to her and the symbolism of Titanic for the explorer. Basically, the movie took us to a meeting with the haunting ghost of the past.The movie had many powerful lines about life, particularly from Old Rose and Jack. Old Rose has quotes about the past. Jack has quotes about living a life. The sinking scenes of Titanic was haunting. It was Jack and Rose take us to the moment for those got stranded waiting for the boat to return. After watching the movie, I felt I have gone through the experience of Jack and Rose and many other victims. I can't say that about the other Titanic movies. Of course, even with great idea, the story won't work without the acting, the setting, the cinematography, and the music, which were all superb. Watching this movie was like I was on the Titanic maiden voyage.It was a sad movie in one sense because of the disaster, but it was also a hopeful movie because of what a person can struggle through despite of a traumatic event in the past. James Cameron had triumphantly raised the Titanic for everyone. He brought stardom to Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet who played Jack and Rose respectively. He also revived the classic age actress Gloria Stuart who played the Old Rose. With the success of this movie, he was able to spent time in the next 10+ years doing research in revolutionizing digital 3D.

Then, BOOM!  The ship hit the iceberg, and the technical side of Cameron came out.  I was so impressed with the camera angles, the sound, and the visualization of the sinking.

I remember seeing this movie once with my mom and dad, and then my mom and I loved it so much that we went to go see it for a second time.I just recently saw this movie again last week as it was being re-released in 3D. I never thought I would see this movie in the theaters again, but I'm glad I got the chance to see this movie again on the big screen and better yet, in 3D as well.This is such a tragic love story, I can't help but cry every time I watch it. It's just such a sad story and I'm pretty sure it will always get to me. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were perfectly cast as ""Jack and Rose"". Billy Zane was also an excellent choice for the evil ""Cal"".I'm 21 years old and I know ""Titanic"" is going to be considered a classic in the years to come.I don't know why some people wouldn't like this movie, I think they're insane. This movie introduced me to the true story of a horrific event that I had personally never heard of before seeing the movie. Ever since I've seen the movie, I've become interested in the history of the ""Titanic"", and I love learning as much as I can about this historic event.I'm a huge movie person, but I have to say this is probably my favorite love story.

748,userscreenname,This movie is easily a work of genius.,10,8 August 2004,"Without a doubt in my mind, Titanic is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, if not the best. It is moving each and every time I watch it. It takes this true and tragic story of the Titanic, and adds an amazing love story to it. It is beyond a mere romantic movie, it sets a standard. Winning eleven Academy Awards it is most definitely a masterpiece, and shows the brilliance of the art of filmmaking.James Cameron, the director of the Terminator movies, really shows a soft and compassionate side in this movie. The direction and production of this movie is incredible, it is very craft fully done. The synchronicity and very smooth transition from scene to scene makes every moment of this movie worth while. This movie is over three hours long, but it is the most easily spent three hours. Not at a single moment did I consider this movie to be dragged on or any other such nonsense. The acting in this movie was off the charts, this is the movie that sent Leo's career sky rocketing, it really shows his talent as an actor. The on screen chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is superb, extremely believable. I honestly can not see anyone else filling the shoes of these two, anyone in the movie in fact. What really makes this movie is the story, it is taken from the true story of the Titanic, but there is a fictitious love story the movie is focused around. It adds a Romeo and Juliet scenario, where the rich and poor are separated and can not be together. It is a very romantic and captivating tale. Throughout much of the movie I would be sitting there with a grin on my face in owe of how much chemistry these two have, also the humor, which is not found much in the film, is very classy and elegantly handled.The most memorable factor of this movie is the soundtrack. At any moment in time if the music from the picture were to come on anyone can easily distinguish that it belongs to this movie. Though not heard until the titles, Celine Dion has sung such a beautiful song. The music from this movie really entrances you, and hold you.This movie is easily a work of genius.",Titanic

(I'm still having some difficulty trying to imagine them as lovers) Needless to say, I didn't get goosebumps looking at Leo and Kate pashing or warm fuzzy feelings when they were finally separated forever.Still, I wasn't totally devoid of feeling. I was transfixed by the last hour or so of the film. By the many faces, who realised the inevitable, who accepted their fates quietly and bravely right to the tragic end.That, ladies and gentlemen,  is the real story of the Titanic.",Titanic
754,pjl-7,"5 years on, it still enchants and impresses",9,11 July 2002,"What can I say about Cameron's ""Titanic"" that hasn't already been said?  I watched it originally against my will, to please my wife, and was blown away.  I had been led to expect yet another brit-bashing epic where the wicked aristocrats trample the poor working class - that's how it had been presented to me.  Instead I found a film that portrayed clearly, accurately, and, most importantly, with balance, the world of the early twentieth century with its vast contrasts between haves and have-nots.Many have complained about the score, or about Céline Dion's rendering of the theme song.  Personally, I believe that the score was as near perfect as any movie score can be.  And if you don't happen to like Céline Dion, well, that's your problem.  I was a Céline fan back before she ever learned English, and I still am.  I still find her version of ""The Heart Will Go On"" (minus all the crummy DJ remixes) to be absolutely magical (especially from the top of the Las Vegas Eiffel Tower, looking down on the Bellagio fountain ballet!)And yes, five years later, the film still enchants and impresses.  Every time I watch it, I'm overwhelmed by the incredible attention to detail, the breadth and depth of the screenplay, the amazing special effects.  I could wish that Cameron had eliminated the hokey scene with Jack handcuffed to the pipe, but apart from that, there's nothing I would add to, or take away from this movie.  If time has jaded your tastes to the point where you can no longer appreciate it, I feel sorry for you.  If ""maturity"" has robbed you of the ability to express your appreciation of it, then shame on you.  The ""Mona Lisa"" is a magnificent work of art, no matter how old it gets, or you get.  And so is Cameron's ""Titanic.""",Titanic
755,dmkay,why do so many hate this movie?,9,13 April 2003,"Someone needs to write a dissertation on the audience reaction to this movie.  When it came out, almost everyone loved it and many people saw it multiple times, yet after it won the Oscars, suddenly you weren't cool unless you hated Titanic with a passion.  I don't understand this at all. Maybe it was too successful for its own good, or maybe it was just Cameron's a-hole acceptance speech, but the way the audience has flip-floped on this film is amazing.  Personally, I think it's a great movie.  The dialogue is bad, but otherwise there's nothing terrible about it.  If you don't like it, I can see rating it at 6 or so, but how could over 7,000 people truly believe Titanic deserves a 1 on a scale of 1 to 10?  I mean, COME ON!",Titanic
756,zooeyhall,Ship of Caricatures,1,15 June 2008,"I have always been fascinated by the story of the Titanic, because here is a real story that really happened and was perfect for eventual translation to the big screen. And with today's special effects techniques it was truly possible to recreate a vanished ship and a vanished era.Instead we got: ""Titanic--Ship of Caricatures""There is enough true history in the story of Titanic for some real drama and tension. Instead we get two 1990's Hollywood teens transported back to 1912. We get burlesque chases, a cardboard villain, and every poor-boy-meets-rich-girl cliché' that was ever used in a story. And of course the basic theme of ""Rich People=All Bad---Poor People=All Good"". And all brought to an end by some diva warbling a song that has nothing to do with the story.I appreciate a good love story as much as the next person, and there have been good believable ones in film. However in this one we are asked to believe that a girl in 1912, who has lived a sheltered life and no real knowledge of the world, will in the space of 36 hours or so:1) fall for a third-class pretty-boy 2) pose naked for him 3) have sex with him in a car 4) spit in her fiancé's face 5) tell her mother to shut up 6) jump BACK onto a sinking shipAwwww....c'mon Mr. Cameron!And Cal is such a cardboard villain that about the only thing Cameron didn't do in the movie to make that any clearer to the audience is hang a sign around his neck saying ""VILLAIN"" in big letters and definitely establish that he likes to eat puppies for dinner.DiCaprio is too girlish and prettyboy looking to be a real leading man. And Winslet's acting ability is minimal.If you took the story of Titanic out of Cameron's script, you would have a movie that wouldn't even make it to the teenage hour on Lifetime cable.Not that the movie was a total waste. It was great to see the Titanic as it must have really looked back in 1912, and the sinking was riveting and realistically portrayed.But ""the best movie ever"" as so many on this site proclaim? The best picture Oscar? Maybe for the ""Leonardo is soooo cute!"" types.Just remember it was the Titanic that hit an iceberg...not Beverly Hills 90210.",Titanic
757,Spacetree,The most overrated film ever,3,12 April 2005,"I don't get it. What was spectacular about Titanic? Sure, the special effects were nice for the time, but groundbreaking? Not in my book. The characters were... well likable. Not lovable, nor classic, but likable. The plot? Cookie-cutter. Poor boy meets rich girl, poor boy falls instantly in love with rich girl, rich girl does the same, poor boy dies (Seriously, were you not expecting someone to die. You knew the boat was going to sink). Throw in a historical tragedy, and Wam! Insta-plot. And it gets 11 Oscars. What happened? I mean, Titanic certainly wasn't a make-up Oscar for Cameron for T2.Titanic is one of those films where they intentionally stuff as many things to tug on the heartstrings as possible without actually being engaging or interesting. Pearl Harbor did the EXACT same formula, yet critics panned it.It's OK, yet not sensational in anyway.",Titanic

I didn't go to the movie on my B-Day in March, 1998 to see Leo. I went to see it because I was curious as to what all the hoopla was about. What I saw just took my breath away. It was absolutely incredible how one man can have such an impact on any film. And that man was James Cameron. There was such detail and such accuracy with the sinking of the ship (Including the blinking out of all the lights on board). The post-sinking just went through my bones like a cold chill. I couldn't believe it. People frozen to death, people in lifeboats still calling to see if anyone is still alive, and the final scene with Jack in it. Because of this film, I am studying as much of the Titanic as I can. This movie will remain a classic for years to come.",Titanic
759,jojofla,"A romantic, spectacular epic",10,4 December 1998,"As a Titanic buff since the age of 5, I was very excited and impatient to see this film--the whole of 1997 I was on pins and needles awaiting its release (you can't imagine how crushing it was when it delayed from June to December).  Of course, with that much anticipation, I was worried that I might also be massively disappointed--but not only was I happy with the results, I was ecstatic!  This movie is simply extraordinary.  It magnificently, beautifully brings the Titanic back to life, fulfilling one's dream of actually being able to sail on the mammoth liner.But what really drew me back again and again to see it was the radiant, exquisite performance of Kate Winslet.  She propels this movie with such grace and beauty that it's difficult to take your eyes off her, despite all the chaos going on around her.  If the Oscars were given out based on genuine excellence of a performance, the statuette would've been hers. Unfortunately, politics has to play a part, so she was denied what was justly hers.

I would give it a 10, but it's still not as good as Dawn of the Dead.  Now everybody runs off to the theater to catch a good movie.  Surprisingly, the majority of movies at the box-office are above-average.  They better be if I'm forkin' out a couple bucks and an hour or two of my time.  Three hours in this case. It doesn't seem like that long, though, because it rarely ever gets boring. And about the bad dialogue...this is bad dialogue?  You should check out my Attack of the Bathroom Creature if you think Titanic has terrible lines in it.  They're memorable, and that's what counts.  James Cameron obviously knows how to make a movie, let alone hitting a home run every time his name appears on the silver screen.  Aliens and The Terminator are fine masterpieces, so I expected the same here.  This exceeded my expectations, however, and I'll be waiting for his next.  So just remember, Leo, if it wasn't for Jimmy, this movie would have only made half the money...trust me. Either way, the first and last 15 minutes are going down in cinema history.

Lets look at the facts;A> There were no commercial tie-ins with any other popular businesses, like Walmart or McDonalds, which is standard for a hollywood blockbuster these days. Look at Star Warts: Phantom Menace, I was actually able to get JarJar Binks bum wipe, Literally. Thats Hype, and it all took place before the movie came out. All the Hype for Titanic happened AFTER the film was released and it came from people who had seen it and loved it.B> There was no money left over at the end of production for a huge ad campaign, this is a fact. They almost lost out the first weekend to a James Bond film because of this, James Cameron and some of the other producers had to hit the talk show circuit in hopes of avoiding a total massacre at the box office.C> The stars gave him no help, Leonardo was so sure that the movie was going to bomb that he did no public appearances before the movie came out, he only hit the talk shows in about week 3 or 4 of the films release. No one had faith in this movie, not the stars, not the Studio heads, no one but James Cameron himself and he was willing to put his entire future as a film maker on the line by giving back his salary.All the guys who hate titanic that I have spoken to are just jealous of Leonardo. They say ""the movie just made money cuz girls love him"", well if that were true then ""The Beach"" would be the second biggest film of all time wouldn't it?I don't think Loenardo is a great actor, and I personally believe Titanic will ruin is career because he'll never top it and he is so sure that he is the reason it was a success. But its a great movie overall, and its not stardard hollywood fluff aimed at high school kids like American Pie, or teen-aged sex farce #2263455283 as I like to call it.

You see the hopefulness in every one when boarding, not knowing what awaits ahead. And you see the tragic horrors unfold as the Titanic sunk.

768,andrewtowne-1,Hollywood at its best: should be in the top 100 movies ever made,10,11 February 2009,"I loved this movie. It has everything -- romance, tragedy, comedy, suspense, action, adventure, acute social commentary -- and is extremely well crafted.Many movies try to do everything and fail. This movie tries to do everything and succeeds beautifully. Better than that, it is greater than the sum of its remarkable parts. And it is hard to get better than that.Those who are -- with I admit a lot of justification -- cynical about big Hollywood productions might not ever accept what I am saying. But being closed-minded is not the same as being clever. Not every low-budget ""art"" or independent film is great; neither is every big-budget production from Hollywood bad. ""Titanic"" not only isn't bad, I am confident that it will go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever made.Let's begin with Leonardo DiCaprio. He is in a class by himself as an extraordinarily good looking young man who is not just a pretty boy, but who can really act. He was riveting in ""The Basketball Diaries."" He is no less outstanding in ""Titanic."" I have never seen an actor showing such range -- from drug addicted athlete to romantic lead -- in such a short period of time. Clearly, the only thing that can hold DiCaprio back is a bad script. This leads me to my next key point: ""Titanic"" is very well written. There is not a single false note in the writing, and the plotting is very tight with no holes that I can see. It all fits neatly and plausibly together -- which is rare both in novels and in movies.I could go on, praising the other actors, the direction, the special effects, etc., but I think I've made my overall point. This is not just some over-blown pseudo-romance featuring depth-less and soul-less ""beautiful people."" It makes me proud that Americans can still create great art -- even in Hollywood.",Titanic

Billy Zane has seldom shown restraint, and this film is no exception. Oscar winner Kathy Bates, however is solid as an iceberg...er...rock as the ""unsinkable"" Molly Brown, but she can't save it. Jim Cameron has been responsible for many screen classics, but this isn't one of 'em. The dialogue is extremely funny.

770,Lamprey,Just a good movie,10,12 September 1999,"It takes a decade or so before narrow-minded people see beyond the hype and enjoy a movie for what it is.  Titanic and other mega-hits may have made tons of cash, but this fact should not persuade or dissuade anyone from enjoying the movie.  Just remember, Titanic was not hyped up like The Phantom Menace was.  Titanic's success was due almost entirely to being a good movie, and appealing to a very wide audience range.  If you want to hate a movie for being it's marketing, hate Phantom Menace or Blair Witch. Cameron has been my favorite director since Aliens, and this movie made him a household name, as he deserves.  I can't stress it enough: be objective, judge a movie on the movie, not on it's marketing.  Just remember, other directors sell themselves out and spend more time marketing their movies than making them (Lucas and Spielberg).  Cameron has never done this.  He may be a jerk, but he has integrity and simply loves to make movies, as Titanic shows.  He doesn't care how much money they make.",Titanic
771,Nog,"There are much, much better epics out there...",1,12 August 2003,"Despite Cameron's showboating at the Academy Awards, this is simply a bombastic mess. His first mistake was to take on too many roles, and crucially, that of screenwriter. What flimsy story he concocted to precede the disaster is rife with bad dialog and the most tired stereotypes imaginable. Take a look at the ""Goofs"" page here, too. You would think they could have done much better; sloppy work for one of the most expensive films ever made.I felt like shouting at the screen at times: are you kidding? They spend how many minutes of the film in bone-chilling water and aren't even shivering just a little bit after getting out? (The water temperature would have to be about, what, 30 degrees? After all, there's icebergs floating in it! They would have been hypothermic within minutes, and dead after a few more.) And he gets the Best Director Award for such atrocious work?

772,Aberlass,Words can not convey the depth of this Experience,9,18 March 2000,"This is not really a story about two lovers & a big ship. This is an experience that you can dive into at any stage of life & find a buried treasure. Forget Cameron & his plagirism of previous 'Titanic' films or indeed his own films like the 'Abyss'. He is a true artist, as he learns from previous work & evolves it, nothing is wasted. Like many 19th Century painters & novelists, I doubt he knows or can appreciate the independent life of his creation. If he were to understand the magic (the essence of his directorial inspiration that drives actors performances) it would become formulaic & worthless.Sit close to the screen, with music at maximum & feel the experience. You will find yourself in a metaphorical world that will always be relevant & will always mean something. There is an intangible quality that sucks you in against your will.Consider Kate Winslet's recent comment that she was in the middle of nowhere in a remote country yet an old man approached her & knew she had been in Titanic. This highlights the magic that is interwoven in the actors performances that touches people regardless of the film's context or theme. The appeal is nothing to do with a ship, it is about the essence of human spirit & the motivation to live a full life. Kate should have won an Oscar, because her performance is perfection personified. I hope that in time all the actors will come to value (without needing awards to validate their worth) the quality of the art that they were fundamental in instrumenting.Words can not do justice to the priceless value of emotional & spiritual experience that this film evokes. But be warned, the experience this film offers can be addictive, as you will always be searching for the Holy Grail that is at it's core.",Titanic
773,unigolyn,Inexplicable.,10,14 September 2002,"What's inexplicable? Firstly, the hatred towards this movie. It may not be the greatest movie of all time, but gimme a break, it got 11 oscars for a reason, it made EIGHTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS for a reason. It's a damn good movie. Which brings to the other inexplicable aspect of it. I have no idea whatsoever why this movie left such an impression on me when I saw it in theaters. I've rewatched it on TV and video, and it had none of the impact it had when I saw it on the big screen (twice, or maybe three times, actually). But that might be it, the appeal of it. It's a Movie, yes, capital M there, it's an Epic, it's a spectacle in the order of Gone With the Wind or Ben Hur. Now, Ben Hur and Gone With the Wind seem kinda hokey to me, with the hammy acting and excessive melodrama. Not that Titanic has none of that. Well, the acting was actually very good. The melodrama was quite heavy-handed at times.But the reason Titanic works is that it's such an emotional ride. I usually enjoy movies that stimulate the mind, or give me a visual thrill. This movie isn't exactly dumb, but it's not cerebral at all. The visual thrills are simply means to an end, to fuel the emotions of the audience. I didn't cry when Bambi's mom died, I don't react to tearjerkers. But this is a tearjerker to the power of ten million, an emotional rollercoaster that, if it were a regular one, would make Buzz Aldrin scream like a little girl. And I'm sure that if you see it on video and have decided that you hate it, and have a ready supply of cynicism, then you can thoroughly dislike this movie. But if you let that disbelief suspend just a bit, if you give this epic melodrama the benefit of the doubt, you'll enjoy it completely. And look at the top ten grossing films of all time. Is a single one of them bad? Is a single one of them worth a score of 1 out of 10? No, not even The Phantom Menace. And this movie made 1.8 BILLION DOLLARS worldwide. It can't be bad. Not possible. 10/10.p.s. how can anyone even consider comparing this to spiderman? spiderman was a fun movie, but it was a total 9/11 kneejerk that caused it to gross as much as it did. it simply wasn't anything all that special. no one will remember it in 50 years. but i'm pretty sure Titanic will be remembered.",Titanic

And, it's called Titanic, and it was directed by James Cameron. This film won 11 Oscars in 1997 (including the best film) and had a box office success of titanic grandeur, one of the biggest in history, critically acclaimed, adored by the public and revolutionary for its special effects. Well, despite its undeniable legacy, there are reasons that, obviously, Titanic is not as perfect and wonderful as many people think, and that it does not deserve its Oscars or be selected as one of the best films of all time. The Oscar for best picture should definitely have gone to the fantastic L.A. Confidential, and that movie is way better than this silly melodramatic crap.",Titanic

The film is really a drama with a strong romantic thread. The acting was above average, directing was amazing, and the cinematography showed you how it actually felt when the disaster took place.

But Rose has a decision to make, because she is actually on her way to marrying another man, Cal Hockley, who was Jack locked up in a room when the so called unsinkable ship hits an iceberg, and begins to sink. Rose now must find Jack before the ship sinks and they drown, and they must fight to stay alive on the sinking Titanic.One of the most impressive parts of this film was the fantastic visuals. They were absolutely stunning, and they really needed to be for the film to work. The story was obviously very sad, and probably most people before they even see the film can guess how it will end. The story to the Titanic in general is just one of the most tragic events in history, and James Cameron did a very good job making it into a movie. The direction was actually what I thought to maybe be the best part of the film. It took a lot of skill on the part of James Cameron to make such a realistic, yet good movie.To make a tragic true story such as this, the cast is really a very important part of the film. It could possibly either ruin, or make a movie. Obviously, in the case of Pearl Harbor many believe the cast could have very nearly destroyed the movie. Thank you Michael Bay. However, the Titanic I found the cast to be perfect. Leonardo DiCaprio may not have been even so much as nominated for an Oscar, which if you look at who was nominated he probably did not deserve to be, but his performance was still nothing short of excellent. Kate Winslet though, was easily deserving of her nomination. Her performance was brilliant. The musical score by James Horner was incredible. He will always be remembered by me for the music to this film, and A Beautiful Mind.Overall, the Titanic really was a great film With outstanding visuals, beautiful acting, and unbelievable direction. I think a lot of people think this film is overrated, and I do understand where they are coming from because 11/14 Oscars might be taking it a bit too far. But the film really was good, and it deserved many of the Oscars that it won. Titanic is one of the better movies that I have seen, and will always be considered so by me.",Titanic
781,gaiter88,This film is a bit like Marmite!,3,22 April 2005,"So you either love it or you hate it, I personally fall in to the hate camp. However I do feel that may be hate is perhaps too a strong a word to be using (it really should be reserved for the likes of Michael Schumacher and Roy Keane!).The down fall of Titanic is it success really, because if it hadn't been so big no one would really care about it, and more importantly those of us who didn't like it wouldn't feel so angry and aggrieved that it made soooo much money! If you ignore all the hype and just look at the film a clearer picture emerges. As a piece of history telling it is not all that great, it is much too involved in its lead characters for that, and if you want to know more about the event of the Titanic sinking you'd be far better off watching A Night to Remember. What Titanic really is, is a romantic drama. On this front it is not too bad, slightly too sugary for me (and I expect most serious cinema goers) but for those who just want to be charmed and 'loved up' it is fine, Leo and Winslet do a reasonable job, and the story is reasonable believable and interesting.So why, you may well ask, have I given it a rating of 2? The answer to this is simple. I love films, and I like to think although I have certain tastes and favourites I do appreciated a good film when I see it. Titanic is mediocre to reasonable at best, but when it was released it seemed to manage to brainwash the nation, and in fact whole world, into thinking it was the best thing since sliced bread. I had friends arguing its 'greatness' at me, and at the time (and still now) all I could do was feel sorry for them for having such a bad understanding and knowledge of films to think Titanic was at the top of the tree.On top of this I really felt aggrieved at the amount of money it had commanded in cost and sales. Money which may well have made handfuls of marvellous smaller films, but much more importantly could have gone someway to solving the problems within this world instead of lining the studies pockets! And so help me god if I ever have to hear that awful song again!",Titanic
782,rudimir-bombardinovic,Masterpiece underrated,10,2 September 2007,"I saw this movie few hours ago and I can't help asking myself same question: ""Why is it so poorly rated?""IMDb is the best movie site I ever saw and I noticed when it comes to ratings it's surprisingly how users ratings work good for me. In 95% cases rating over 7 means that the movie is worth watching. For me Titanic is without any doubt classic. It was brilliant film when I saw it 10 years ago and it didn't loose any of its quality when I saw it moments ago. Why is it so I don't intent to write because I thing many reviews here did that already. Shortly, lets just say that it was directed perfectly by visionary James Cameron in the way that 3 hours long epic film doesn't get boring, characters are played excellent by many talented actors (in that moment Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet were relatively unknown), story is also great and connects love story and Titanic's fate beautifully, special effects are impressive even today and Hans Zimmer did amazing job with music. When I saw Titanic was rated 6.9 I was stunned, it should be rated over 8 at least. Why is it so? Well, few years after Titanic's release it became very popular to spit on it without good reason so it probably got even to peoples minds.I guess even peoples opinions can be manipulated. It's just sad it affected this truly wonderful movie.Evergreen 10/10",Titanic
783,elainehowie,The only film to ever make me cry,10,14 June 2018,"Titanic is 3 hours long yet managed to keep me captivated the entire time. You can clearly see the effort put into this masterpiece. Basically everything about the film is amazing: the visuals, the characters and the story in general. I love how the story cut between the past and the present. The actresses of both old and young Rose are amazing. Practically all of the actors put on a dazzling performance, even the extras. The first part of the film for the most part generates positive feelings, even though you know what's going to happen. The part where the ship sinks creates powerful emotions, as the film really involves you and makes you feel like you were a part of it. The film also makes you become attached to the characters. These scenes are deeply upsetting, and this film is the only film that I have cried during due to how realistic it is and that the fact that you know this really happened. Overall, this film is beautifully done and is fully deserving of all the high praise it has gained. It makes you feel all kinds of emotions and is definitely a film of the ages.",Titanic
784,Marcey13,Not very impressive....,8,15 September 1998,"I'd like to say that 'Titanic' only got it's attention because Leonardo DiCaprio was in it and it was the most expensive movie. It was nothing like the real sinking of the Titanic, and they made too many mistakes, which you will notice if you watch carefully. I'm a fan of Camerons work, but this was simply an attention seeker movie, like 'Godzilla'. It shouldn't have gotten all the Oscars because there were better movies, with much better standards. The only Oscars it deserved to win was best song, and best music, which was the only good thing about this movie. If you wanna see a real masterpiece see 'Good Will Hunting' or 'Sliding Doors'. For those who haven't seen it, see it but don't expect the best, expect an average disaster movie.",Titanic
785,zio ugo,"Bad, bad, bad... (did I tell you it's bad?)",1,20 January 1999,"Although it is easy to see how this brainless saga could appeal to an equally brainless segment of the public, it is much harder to understand the honors that have been bestowed on this mediocre (albeit expensive) production. The special effects were pretty good, and the details of reconstruction of some of the inanimate objects was remarkable. The problem was in the animate entities.The main characters are anachronistic: essentially 90's teenagers dressed in funny turn-of-the-century clothes. If you are thrilled by the fact that Rose decided to follow her heart instead of the social conventions of the time, you should consider having your fiancee/wife/daughter run away with a gang member she only met two days ago. It is easy to laugh at the social conventions of 90 years ago. A film aiming at a meaningful social discourse should make us look critically at contemporary mores. It is easy to laugh at the Victorian sexual code. Let us laugh at monogamy if we have the courage!I expect a historic film to help me understand the age it refers to, and to help me relate it to my age. Placing to MTV teenagers in a 1912 as real as Conan the Barbarian's middle ages doesn't help me do either.Some of the scenes are artificially emotionally charged (e.g. the two lovers looking from the bow of the ship to the horizon) but one cannot escape the impression that the number, intensity, and sequencing of these scenes come from some ""How to make a movie"" manual that you can probably buy for $10.95 at the nearest Barnes and Noble. All in all, I would say that the film reveals a decent craftsmanship, but not a single shred of art (a situation not uncommon in Hollywood).I saw this film in a theatre, and I don't feel any need to see it again at home. I have better things to do with my time. But if all you like in a film is to go see some special effects, and saying ""ooooo..."" when the ship sink, and ""aaaaah...."" when the main characters kiss, then this is the film for you.",Titanic
786,Rash,Didn't sink fast enough,6,3 December 1998,"""Look Fabrizio, look dolphins. And one of them has jumped out of the water"".At long last I watched this film with trepidation after hearing so many good things. It started off impressively enough but when I saw the dolphins scene I thought 'oh no, here we go - welcome to cliche world'.However, putting aside a fairly ordinary love story this film had some good acting, impressive periodic detail and superb special effects. Unfortunately, I had to use the fast forward button on my remote after the first third of the film because I knew exactly what was going to happen in the middle (as with any other bog standard 'rich girl meets poor boy' love story). I couldn't wait to see how the ship was going to rest in its eternal bed under the sea.And I wasn't disappointed. I could feel the agony of those poor people trying desperately to cling on to life. I almost cried when those b*****ds in the life boats didn't return to rescue the people in the water. And the special effects rated as the best I've seen in 1998 (remember I've only just seen it).Conclusion: I gave it an eight out of ten for special effects but took away two points for going on a wee bit too long with an uninvolving love story. I don't rate this movie as one of my favourites but wasn't disappointed after watching it (as I usually am with many cliche'd movies). Definitely one to see.",Titanic
787,Morpheus-20,Good... But not great.,8,10 May 2000,"This is a good movie -- there's no doubt about that. However, it is not all it's cracked up to be. I saw it about a week after it opened in Sweden.
There are some magnificent performances, for instance the oft forgotten Billy Zane, playing the jealous would-be husband of Rose, 'Cal' Hockley. I must confess that I have something against Leonardo DiCaprio, but there are a few performances in which he shines! These are: ""Luke"" in the series Growing Pains, ""Arnie"" in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, and ""Jack"" in Titanic. Kate Winslet, however, delivers a very stereotypical ""rich-girl-getting-a-taste-of-the-wild-life"" performance, which I soon put out of my mind. The best female performances are instead Kathy Bates as ""'Unsinkable' Molly Brown and Frances Fisher as ""Ruth DeWitt Butaker"".
A final note: The saddest moment of the movie is not the one people usually thinks about, but rather the fate of ""Tommy Ryan"" (Jason Barry)... watch it again, and see what I mean. I don't usually cry at movies, but during that scene, I was close to tears.",Titanic

The drama is the strongest point of this film from noble band player, sacrifices of other passengers and the inevitable end of the designer of Titanic, Thomas Andrews.Special effect is awesome especially when the dolphins jumped near the massive bow of Titanic and the sinking of course. The wonderful thing is it doesn't looks like a special effects! unlike some CGI generated characters in Mars attack or Jumanji (monkeys). The music is very good and fit nicely on every scene and making the film feels like in 1912.well done for first timer James Cameron, but he needs more learning to reach same level as Steven Speilberg.
My verdict. This is not a thrill ride as Star Wars or Starship troopers or fine tune of Schindler's List, but a good movie. You like it if you don't mind Leonardo DiCaprio, sitting like a bum for 3 hours, or listening to old fashion like music. Ill give it 8 out of 10.",Titanic

Firstly there are no spoilers in this review, so don't worry.I thought the main characters acting was poor, Kate Winslet really shown up in her worst film to date (pity, because Heavenly Creatures was so good) and Leonardo DiCaprio was nothing special compared to his performance in 'Man in the Iron Mask,' which was very good. However, some of the supporting characters did very well, and it was from them that the emotion was created. You really got a sense of terror and helplessness that they felt, without being clouded by very corny dialogue, like the lead characters were.The special effects were magnificant, well done to them. Definately a cinema film with plenty of stunning visuals, long shots and wide pan angles.  The ship looked fantastic and realistic.  The effects had to be good, otherwise I think the film would have sank without trace, and James Camereon would be mourning his lost millions for a long time to come. Neil",Titanic

794,gatsby06,Downright amazingly bad,3,22 June 2007,"(THIS *&%$#! COMMENT MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS.)(Or it may not.At least it may spoil your appetite for this film.)I have to give James Cameron credit for a sort of devious ingenuity: He created a movie so repulsively bad that a reasonably sophisticated viewer would find it unbearable to sit through. Hence, so many glowing reviews.I watched it, once. But it keeps popping up on TV. And even for free it is not worth watching. Five minutes these days is my absolute limit. Each time I stumble across it, this movie just seems to get worse and worse. The acting is so bad I'm surprised Cameron didn't just make this into a sort of Disney cartoon. Disney's Buena Vista does this sort of simplistic bubble gum movie better, such as White Fang; Ethan Hawke as Jack Conroy was more credible than DiCaprio as Dawson. And the aerial computer graphics look way too much like cartoon animation.As to historical accuracy, give me a break!!! I can't say this is any worse than the other nonsense to come out of Hollywood, though. Frankly, anyone who takes any so-called non-fiction or historical movies as more than 1 percent accurate is a fool.Hey, I am willing to suspend a certain amount of disbelief for a good movie, but this one demands way too much. They pull a drawing that has been sitting on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean for 80 years that is in excellent condition and hold it up as proof of why it was worth hundreds of millions of dollars to find the Titanic. And what is this precious work of art? A Rembrandt? A DaVinci? A Van Gogh, at least? No, it is an amateurish pornographic sketch. Excuse me? Maybe some 21st century girl would pose naked at the drop of a hat, but a proper girl in the 1910s?Hey, if you believe this nonsense, then the rest of the movie will seem comparatively plausible, and I can see how you might find this movie ""historically accurate."" I don't mind if you enjoyed this movie; that's what movies are for. Tastes vary. Some people prefer emotional manipulation that is more subtle. I would hope you Titanic fans would explore cinema a little more, and not insist that this is the greatest movie ever made, perfect, etc. What's with all these superlatives? Does Cameron have a claque?Look, before you say Titanic is the best movie EVER, (which implies you have seen every movie every made) at least go see Gone With the Wind. I dare you. Then see if you can even mention Titanic in the same breath.And I think potential viewers should be forewarned that not everybody is going to like this movie. That's what reviews are for. Spoiler ahead: OK, the ship was named ""Titanic"" and it sank. That much they got right. Well, sort of: it was the RMS Titanic, not the SS Titanic.If you want to learn the true story, try going to the BBC page ""Titanic: Sinking the Myths,"" by Paul Louden-Brown.",Titanic
795,du_man,James Cameron's worst-- though that's not too bad.,8,7 June 2003,"Rating: * * 1/2
James Cameron is one of the best film directors out there.  He made ""The Terminator"" in 1984, which is not only Arnold Schwarzenegger's best film, but quite simply the greatest action film ever made.  ""Aliens"" and ""The Abyss"" were excellent sci-fi films and literally invented new technology.  ""Terminator 2"" was a great sequel, and ""True Lies"" was a ton of fun.  He also made T2-3D, a cool theme park attraction.Then he made ""Titanic.""  ""T2"" was the most expensive film of its time at a hundred million dollars.  Titanic more than doubled that.  It went far over budget, in fact.  And it was well spent.  The special effects are absolutely incredible.Cameron's script, however, leaves something to be desired.  It concerns unsatisfied 1st class 16-year-old Rose (Kate Capshaw) and her romance with 3rd class con guy Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio).  His profession: wander around Paris, France drawing girls naked.  Here is problem #1.
(WARNING: minor but predictable spoiler)  In 1912, a 1st class teenaged girl sleeps with a 3rd class teen 24 hours after they meet.  Maybe, *maybe* in the  80s, but in 1912?In fact, that's the main problem.  The film revolves around a romance that is stupid and completely unbelievable.  In other words, the script stinks.The film lasts over three hours.  This is not necessarily a bad thing. All of Sergio Leone's classics last about that long.  But in Titanic, the hours are divided up in different qualities.  The first hour is fine and somewhat spectacular but not great.  The second is really stupid and ruins the film.  The last hour is superb in nearly every way.  As I have already mentioned, the special effects are awesome, and Cameron's directing abilities are at their very best.The cast is fine but not great.  I've never been much of a fan of DiCaprio, but he's okay here.  Capshaw is really good, but is outdone by Billy Zane as her slimy fiancee.This won eleven Academy Awards, which has only been done once before, for 1959's ""Ben Hur.""  Ben Hur was a true classic, and deserved it.Titanic won Best Picture, which should have gone to LA Confidential. Best Director was more or less deserved for helming something on this scale. The special effects, sets, cinematography, costumes, etc. definitely deserved it.  James Horner's score was good, but it did not deserve and Oscar as much as some of his others, like Glory and Star Trek II.  And surely this wasn't the best film song of the year.As I said in the one-line-summary, it is Cameron's worst so far... but that's not really that bad.  Steven Spielburg has made worse than this.It might not be a bad idea to see this film just for the spectacle. I just can't think of any other reason.",Titanic

Tonight I watched the whole thing with my grandmother. I was completely wrong on that. This was the best movie that I've ever seen, and probably ever will see in my entire life. Me and my grandmother were both in tears by the end of it.

If the ship is about to leave port, you feel as though you are actually watching the Titanic leave port in the massive waving crowd. I know this has been said before, but I must say it again.

801,nbutcher-69458,The heroine's journey monomyth made epic,9,16 May 2020,"This film is to teenage girls what the original Star Wars films are to teenage boys. It perfectly encapsulates the female monomyth - or the hero's journey - which is why it is such a classic and why it will always resonate through the ages. Other stories have tried to do a female monomyth, but Titanic nails it.We know what happens to the Titanic, so the romance between Jack and Rose deserves special attention. Jack Dawson is to Rose what Obi-wan Kenobi was to Luke Skywalker: the mentor that taught you to be the hero you didn't think you could be.
What makes Titanic special from many other romance stories is that Jack doesn't rescue Rose from her predicament. Inspired by Jack, Rose begins the story as a damsel in distress but by the end of her story she is no helpless damsel. There are some lessons here for men too - if they're paying attention.The special effects for the Titanic were second to none. The Titanic - like the Death Star in Star Wars, is not only gorgeous but hangs menacingly over the film. The filmography of it's sinking is terrifying and incredibly effective.In many ways, the Titanic itself is a metaphor for our own lives. We all start on a wonderful adventure when we are born - but at one point in our lives we *will* hit that iceberg and sink. What do we do onboard in the days, months, and years leading up to this? Titanic goes out of it's way to clearly suggest that class and wealth mean nothing when we're all going over the edge of that ship - and then, in light of all this, what is truly important? This film gives us that resolution too.For all these reasons - notwithstanding the music - the film is a masterpiece of cinema. Brilliant in sheer spectacle, deep thematically, emotionally moving, and will be forever timeless.I only docked it one point for excessive run-time, some hokey dialogue, and some unnecessary swearing.",Titanic

People, make up one opinion and stick with it. But I say this film is and always was terrible. The most horrid was of 194 minutes in my entire life. The story of the Titanic, first off, is not very interesting to watch for three odd hours. And the artificial love story does not help down this horse pill of a movie. The music is the only thing that I enjoyed, but even that wore out its welcome near the last hour of the film. Cameron should've sunk this film before it came out and robbed people of 1.8 billion hard-earned dollars. I'm sorry to myself for seeing this film because everyone else was, and I'm sorry to everyone else who saw this embracement for this reason. It is not the fan of film, just the fan of stupid dialogue and great big ships sinking with bad graphics and all. Now give the Phantom Menace a break, will ya, and say something about this shipwreck!.5/10 (I can't bring myself to give a movie the same rating I gave to the 1998 version of Psycho, otherwise, I would be most inclined to slap a goose egg on this one.)",Titanic
803,Chronus,The deep waters of Memory will never sink the fascination for Titanic,8,11 August 1999,"Many critics (like the one in NBC, who got to the point of showing a cartoon with a ship sinking into the waters of failure), seemed certain that we would watch a new Titanic tragedy: overbudgeted, late release, etc... James Cameron never seemed to be one those men who dream of doing something no one dares doing and keep that dream alive...He never looked to be a dreamer. That´s the problem with most people, and directors and writers, nowadays. But...wow, was I wrong. He had a dream, he awaited the opportunity...and he did it.This Titanic movie has a greek tragedy dimension to it and also an epic proportion that most Titanic TV movies and Hollywood movies do not.You can´t help but feel very close to the characters, irrespective of their being historical or fictional. The soundtrack and the acting achieve something that, together with camera positioning and ship and costumes details, has put behind every documentary and film ever done on great disasters in History. Maybe someday, someone will try something similar with Pompei, or the Zeppelin...I doubt it.The storyline is too simple, but mr. Cameron had his hands on too much material (the abyss between upper classes and lower classes, the characters' final struggle, the replic of Titanic, the tragedy itself) to pay more attention to the plot. So, it´s predictable. So what?Unless you´re dead or you belong to a particular kind of person that considers feelings and the sense of loss something unimportant and unworthy of movie camera´s focus , you can´t help but go along with the character´s plight and fears... With good acting, good special effects, marvellous soundtrack, historical details...how can´t I put myself in the position of those 1600 people or so who lost their lives? Going through the movie, reaching the finale, I began thinking ""What if it was me, in Jack´s place, or the captain´s place, or the men and women below decks, or the men in the machine rooms?""The final scene of Titanic is a deserved and beautiful homage paid to those who survived those who die. It´s poetic and sweet, and somehow puts the souls of those who saw the movie at peace with History. Sometimes, Nature, the Cosmos, God, puts us to the test, and one of those tests took place in 1912.

Hey, it's great movie making and #1 worldwide box office hit, but a shame neverthelessJames Cameron went for the oldest trick in the book (even the 1953 version had a similar plot line) and it worked wonder. Still, I would appreciate the father/son interaction in the 1953 version to be more genuine and less over the top.",Titanic

It should be noted that this is one of the most expensive movies of all-time and that even though it had a great set, the acting is pathetic. For 200 million dollars they could have got a decent cast. And then there is Gloria Stewart. She made me want to cry because I paid eight bucks to see her on film. This is a one demensional movie that at its very best should have won maybe two awards and pull down a box-office of like 200 million. Three hours plus is painfully long for this kind of film.

812,teutonicknight,What a crap,3,5 November 2002,"I've seen this film recently and without a doubt I can say that these four hours (it was shown in Polish Tv so interrupted by ads) were the biggest waste of time in my life . I can't understand why it was given 12 Oscar Awards ? Was the Academy bribed ? Were they all on dope while watching it? Obviously the ship itself is great , the sinking looks authentic , even the whole idea of the film and romantic plot is not bad . But this is just 20 per cent of every movie , the rest is just awful . First of all bad acting. Di Caprio and Winslett are the most annoying pair in history , this toxic mixture of 'free artist' and spoiled brat made me seasick . Another thing is the dialogue . I haven't heard such a nonsense in my entire life . It was just hilarious . Another problem is that every character is black or white ,either good or bad . Nobody seems to be developing , changing , showing various shades of their personality . And last but not least Cameron lack the judgement of the mood . I mean that in some scenes I was drowning in pathos , and in others when something serious is needed he spoils everything with some pseudo-funny dialogue or situation .The worst in it is the final scene when the old Rose dies and her soul goes back on the ship ,where she's welcomed by the rest of the dead passengers , and after kissing Jack everyone is applauding . I wondered where was Caledon Hockley .If he committed suicide in 1929 he must have been with the others , and if so was he applauding with them ? All in all give me half of Cameron's budget and without a doubt you will be given a masterpiece not a crap like this one .",Titanic
813,colebt33-780-179547,A powerful piece that deserves the recognition,7,14 July 2010,"It's really only half a good film. But then again it's hard to make a romantic film that good anyway. James's Carmon's Titanic has obtained a place for itself in the history of film. Maybe because of it's huge box office success, or possibly it's utter domination at the 1998 Academy Awards, winning 11 categories including Best Picture. The film has been recognized for it's amazing cinematography and equally stunning visual effects, as well as immaculate sound editing, and an empowering musical score. It's quite an achievement and I have to give James Cameron grabs for it. And unlike most chick flicks Cameron actually has something to talk about rather than just a touchy love story. Like for example the concurrence of rich and poor, because in a disaster situation the amount of money you have in your pocket is not going to save you. There are many classical moments in this film to be remembered. There's three specific scenes that I'm not going to spoil for you that have an incredibly romantic yet tolerable essence to it, but mainly because Cameron delivered it in the very best way possible. The bottom line is that Titanic is a film to be remembered, we remember Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCapprio's wonderful on screen chemistry, Celine Dion's uplifting voice, and James Cameron's exceptional take on the most famous shipwreck ever. You can try and forget this chick flick like you would with any other, but you will not succeed.",Titanic
814,mlwitvliet,Mixed emotion,8,21 October 2010,"Titanic is without a doubt a great movie. A lot of the haters are breaking down the movie for the wrong reason. It's not about bad acting or bad special effect. The movie is an absolute masterpiece in that, no question about it.What is it about then??? The script! And i'm totally agreeing on that. The film is based on one of the biggest shipwrecks in history an James Cameron is paying an utterly disrespect to make a romantic movie over a shipwreck that actually happened and it leaves a bit of a bad taste in your mouth. But this is Hollywood! a fictional world and we always have to keep this in mind.yes, Titanic WAS the ship of dreams and had story's enough to tell on it's own accord. That James Cameron didn't use this is a real shame. But again, this is Hollywood, the fictional world!!! In my opinion it should have been the filming of Futility, the book that was written 14 years before Titanic sank and showed a striking resemblance to the events that really happened on Titanic. Then you don't have to worry if the events that really happened are filmed accurate but alas, it isn't. It's a romantic story and a good one. It is a story that could have happened on Titanic and you feel for all the characters and a film should't be utter rubbish just because the script isn't a replica of the real events.Therefore I don't mind it became a blockbuster but it suits that it isn't in the top 250 of best movies in the world which somebody else complained about. When a movie can't pay respect to real events it shouldn't receive respect. And it doesn't.",Titanic
815,davidgoesboating,"Alright film, but over-rated",3,19 March 2005,"This may contain spoilers...... OK just a little bit of background to this review. Firstly, yes I was one of that 0.01% who did not see this movie at the cinemas when it came out. Secondly, when I did see it for the first time on TV last year, I missed the first 45 minutes. However, I saw enough of this movie to see how ridiculously over-rated it was. Firstly, the positives, and there weren't a whole lot. Number one: yes, the special effects were as good as they were supposed to be. The design of the Titanic was amazing. Also the bit at the end where the ship sinks was incredible. Number two: Kate Winslet has a nice body, and you do get to see a lot more of it than I thought you would...... although one could be a bit cynical about that scene, that they only put it in to get more people to watch it. That's about it for the positives. Now for the negatives: Leonardo Di Caprio can't really act. OK, I thought he did well in Romeo and Juliet (which is one of my favorite movies) but his acting and dialog are just really wooden in Titanic. The characters as a whole are just one-dimensional. One of the most laughable points was though how many life-or-death situations there are for Leo and Kate in the last hour (yes, the movie takes forever to finish). First Leonardo gets locked down below deck as the water level slowly rises (ooh will he survive????) and of course gets rescued by Kate Winslet after about 15 minutes. Then Kate's evil fiancée (yes not much room for development in that character) starts shooting at them so they have to run back 5 levels deep before deciding to go back on top. Here they face a literal ""class barrier"" (big metaphor there of course) a big iron gate, which, with help from the other battling workers, Leonardo bravely breaks down. Forgive my sarcasm, but it was hard not to roll my eyes throughout this whole sequence. Then after narrowly surviving half a dozen near-death experiences, Leonardo dies in the lamest way possible. Instead of attempting to find another piece of debris to float on in the water, he rather unnecessarily lets winslet have the whole piece of wood to float on, and lets himself freeze to death. But perhaps the worst part of all was the sequences where we go back to the old 101-year old version of Kate Winslet telling the story, with a bunch of young scientists passing social commentary on it. I've always hated this idea, because it gives away the ending of the film. The viewer knows that she will survive, and Leonardo won't. Which sort of takes away from any of the suspense. Anyhow, I would recommend this movie to anyone (not that you haven't seen it already) but go in with a low expectation and you might find it a decent film. Certainly don't watch it, though, expecting to see a film that deserved 11 Oscars, cos you will be disappointed.",Titanic

817,MiB-6,I'm sick and tired of hearing about this piece of ....,1,3 October 1998,"This is one of the most boring, unexciting, lame, worthless pile of dog heap I have ever seen. I know some overly stimulated people love this film for its emotional romantic story and great acting by 'Leo' and 'Kate' I can't help but feel this is less than rubbish. If this deserved best picture and most successful film of all time, I'm sure The Stupids and Godzilla deserved to be in the AFI Top 100 list. This has no meaning at all, and encourages stupid teens to steal girls from their fiances. I mean, who is the villain here if a poor try-hard gambling artist who seduces rich women and goes into a rich man's car and makes it dirty and makes her think not to marry the man she truly loves and wanted to get married with? That's either a very sick surfer-dude or ONE, DUMB woman. When he dies, he only makes it worse for Kate and basically ruins her life. She has no mother, no husband and no life anymore. It was that S.O.B. who made her live with her daughter in a haystack cabin 80 years later, if DiCrapio wasn't there she would have died happily rich and loved by her family.Yes, James Cameron did a good job wasting his time here, he did probably deserve Responsible for the Biggest Mistake Ever, but he did much better in T2, The Abyss, Aliens and True Lies. Those films actually entertained me. And, Jim, you're NOT the king of the world.The script was wonderful. Glorious is all I can say.""I'll never let go Jack, I'll never let go...""

819,Allan-14,A Milestone Film for the Decade,10,30 November 1998,"I realize that ""Titanic"" is really the kind of movie where you love it or hate it for what it is. And I must say that in all truth I side strongly with the 'love it' category.When I first saw this masterpiece, nearly a year ago, I was in short amazed at the power director James Cameron had achieved. By setting up the actual Titanic disaster with a love story he was able to make me feel like I was right there on the decks of the Titanic as she sank below the Atlantic surface. Seeing 1,500 people freezing to death in the chilling ocean waters in the dark early morning of April the 15th, 1912, I was simply shocked, chilled, mostly because of the realization that this is what happened. Also having known that Cameron had labored so long and hard to get even the most non-essential details correct in his depiction of the ocean liner's disaster helped me feel it too.There is definitely a lesson to be learned from ""Titanic"". Quite a few really. For one thing it is the ultimate reminder that no matter how technologically advanced we are, God will always have the last word on everything. Perhaps Titanic the disaster was a reminder that we need to be careful what ideas we get about our power. ""She is unsinkable. God Himself could not sink this ship,"" said the character Cal.Another lesson, this one related to film: if you are going to spend hundreds of millions on the making and marketing of a film, at least make an honest effort to give the audience a story they can feel, and be involved with. Recent films such as ""Armageddon"" and ""Godzilla"", I think, have been hurt by this overwhelming realization by audiences. The gross of ""Titanic"", which has hit $1.8 billion worldwide, testifies a new hunger for movies that tell their story with really great effects in them, rather than stories written around the idea of effects.I know there are many dissenters out there for this film, but like it or not, twenty years from now there will be a big re-release for this wonderful epic, and again the world will be caught in a Titanic craze, and I will be telling my children about when ""Titanic"" first came out-  just as my dad tells me now about when ""Star Wars"" came out he was floored as well- like ninety percent of the rest of the movie-going nation. ""Titanic"" works so well because it hits so many basic levels of human feeling, because it has such a strong understanding of what the devotion of love is.And for those of you who call off ""Titanic"" and its success to ""Leo-Mania,"" I went to see ""Titanic"" ten times in the theater. I am not a big Leo-fan, and I know he's done better work than this. I am 19 and I'm a guy. Going to see this in the theater, not once in those ten times did the audience consist of at least 75 percent adults.A masterpiece. ""Nuff said.",Titanic
820,Allan-14,"The true ""Gone With the Wind"" of the latter 20th century",10,23 December 1999,"Only a film this popular could have a line divided so sharply between those who love it and those who detest it. I tend to not only discuss a film's technical and artistic merits but it's impact on society as well, and I find ""Titanic"" to be very rich grounds for both. I find it to be a beautiful film in nearly all directions, and though it has some flaws in it, it is for the most part a thoroughly engrossing emotional goldmine of a story. Some find this to be a negative mark.I however see James Cameron's film as perhaps one of the most honest epics of its kind. The affect of the film is amazing in scale if you let it in. Many, especially those who ignored it while it was in theaters and waited for the video, tend to say how banal the dialogue is, how poorly written the script is, or that it's only reason for success was the millions of Leo-fans and FX gurus who lined the blocks to see it.My take on this latter hypothesis is that these people must have sleep-walked through the six months the film was in the top 10, ignoring the fact that something extraordinary was happening in not only America but the world as well: millions wanted to embrace something they felt true to their hearts. Look in the history of box office hits and I can guarantee you'll find a difficult time locating any film people went to see four or five times because their favorite actor was in it, or they loved the special effects and nothing else. And for the Leo-excuse: did anyone ever take into account that no other film starring this magazine-seller even surpassed $60 million in domestic receipts (ten times LESS than ""Titanic"" made)? Johnny Depp and Jonathan Taylor-Thomas are living proof that a handsome actor can sell those teeny-bopper books but their battle to sell tickets is more often where they lose out.Yep, that 13 year old WORLDWIDE female economy is sure booming these days! Granted, those girls made up for a reliable portion. But come on people, $1.8 billion throughout the planet?!?!? That's a lot of dough! The reason a film like this works well not just with teens but with senior citizens who haven't been to the theater in fifteen years is because it resonates with them in a deep, emotional way.""Titanic"" sets up a great historical tragedy with a traditional love story, probably not all that different than something DeMille or Zanuck would've cooked up in the 1930's. It is very easy to see ""Titanic"" as another Zanuck/ Technicolor production, starring a teen Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh. Someone told Shakespeare while he was writing ""Romeo and Juliet"" that a teen love story cannot be written because teenage love/ emotions is not real. Shakespeare did not listen to this garbage, and neither did Cameron. We should be glad that both of them kept their ears plugged.
I won't even begin to go into all the reasons why this is a masterpiece. I will go so far as to say that I am happy it did not start immediately with the iceberg collision. The whole point of the love story which precedes it is to make the disaster of the sinking all the more enormous when it hits, because we care for the lovers Jack and Rose so much. Some say this is the part of the film that suffers, that the set-up is not believable and cliched. I think it works well beause DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are both terrific actors, and while the dialogue is a couple of times hard to bare, the structure of the story is so well filmed and paced that it is hard to care. Some even argue that the love story is pathetic because you cannot really fall in love with somebody over a period of a few days. This is probably the worst reasoning I have heard. Anyone who doesn't believe in this type of love just has not experienced it. It does exist though, and it is a beautiful form of it because the developments of lack of trust were not the first things to enter the relationship. It's called wild romanticism, not lust, and it is something we all need to feel at one time or another.
I cannot convince why ""Titanic"" worked so well with so many millions of people. I can only say for sure why it connected with me. It hit me in the heart and while it felt good to feel for these lovers, it also felt horrible to see where it ended. It's terrible to see 1, 500 people lose their lives on a cruise to New York, and it's more so when you learn of the extreme dedication that was made to accurately portray the sinking. That is something I find difficult not to connect with.",Titanic
821,Casa2000,James Cameron: A Man on a Mission,10,20 February 1999,"It is widely known that the director is the hardest working person on the set.  James Cameron takes this fact to a new level.Cameron took a great interest in the great ship back in 1989 while filming his deep-sea thriller ""The Abyss"".  In 1994, Cameron began principal photography of the wreckage just off the coast of Newfoundland.  As Cameron took his cameras deep into the Atlantic, tears came to his eyes as he looked at the destroyed vessel for the first time.  Cameron was on a mission to re-create the story of the great ship, a mission which could be called the greatest accomplishment in film history.""Titanic"" incorporates the widest variety of genres; it is a romance, a drama, an action/adventure, a suspense/thriller.  It is a tear-jerker, a spirit-lifter, a special effects extravaganza.  It drew in an audience demographic so wide that children, grandparents and all in between love to watch it over and over.  It is one of those few films that you can see ten times and still love it, still notice something else which makes you love it more.  ""Titanic"" took movie-making to a new level, both technically and thematically and in such a way that its achievement may never be surpassed.Cameron poured his heart into this film.  He wanted to produce a tale of the ship which would have a great effect on its viewers; make them feel for the passengers, the tragedy of the ship, the power of Rose and Jack's love.  The symbolism of their relationship mirrors that of the ship itself.  Their love for each other, although short-lived, will last for an eternity.  They came from a different world, different backgrounds, yet the essence of their inner selves is so wholesome, so connected that they could not stand to be apart even if it meant changing everything they know.The film reaches into our hearts, shows us a love so pure, so tragic and destined for destruction yet we all truly care for Rose and Jack, wanting them to survive so their hearts can go on.  Tears came to my eyes on five different occasions while watching this film.  I was pulled into the story, the characters and the sheer presence of the ship.  I wanted everyone I cared about to experience this film, to be able to feel what I felt, to see what I saw.  Cameron showed me a side to the human spirit, human tragedy, and the power of love well beyond anything I knew possible.  I am eternally thankful for Cameron's monumental achievement and I will never forget experiencing ""Titanic"".",Titanic

Among it's many accolades and achievements, ""Titanic"" also holds the unique distinction of being James Cameron's most overrated film to date.

Some time after the Oscars, Titanic became a cool movie to bash and dismiss as just a love story. Everyone started jumping on the bandwagon, hence the number of 1's given by imdb voters.While it's not one of the greatest movies ever made, it's a damn good one and deserves better than it's received. The love story is there to make the disaster more personal to the viewers. And this disaster is not a sudden one; it starts out as the ship just skimming an iceberg, and ends with the ship being torn apart in half and sinking into the sea. It's shot so well that we feel like we're a part of it - as the ship is vertical on the water, it's so tense because you're not sure if it's going to fall backwards or forewards, and if it does, you'll be going along for the ride.I also liked the ending a lot. The assumption is that Rose dies in her sleep (an old woman in her warm bed), and in heaven, returns to the Titanic and to Jack. And it's brilliantly shot in that we see everything through Rose's eyes, the passengers all greeting us, and the Titanic looking so beautiful.It's not a movie I own (it's much too long for repeated viewings), or even love, but I can see it for what it is; powerful, well-made, and epic.",Titanic
826,o_levina,A film to be seen on a large screen only *spoiler!*,2,2 November 2001,"If I had to describe my impression from this film in one word, the word would be `irritation'. James Cameron made a bad-tasted show of one of the greatest tragedies. The plot is simply stupid. The love-story of main characters is absolutely unbelievable and misplaced. It would be better to set such story on a board of some fictitious ship (resembling Titanic if you like). Meanwhile the film about Titanic itself must be as realistic as possible. However, if Cameron failed in presenting the tragedy of the disaster he succeeded in presenting its horror. Visual effects are great. I gave the film two stars for the sake of the only one scene  that one where the ship breaks into two pieces. It's really impressive on a large screen. Titanic becomes worth seeing only after the ship crashes into iceberg. And even then it is spoiled by absurd behaviour of main characters. Furthermore the casting is bad. I liked only Billy Zane as villainous Cal and Victor Carber as unhappy constructor Mr. Andrews (and also some insignificant passengers and members of crew).  DiCaprio can't act at all, Winslet is not very bad but the role is not for her.

Winslet and de Capriolook out of place in such a grand design, and the sub-plot of apsychopathic Zane intent on dastardly revenge seem to pour wateron what could have been a triumph (no pun intended).

I am sure every girl wants a guy like Jack who has it all. Kate Winslet is just out-of-the-world as character Rose. She gave an Oscar winning performances in Titanic. Billy Zane plays his character Cal very well. Kathy Bates plays her character Molly Brown (Who is a real character) very, very, very well. She was the right actress for the role.

830,antidonnie,A Failure of Epic Proportion,3,10 November 2005,"""Collide With Destiny""Story: Two fictional characters put in place of one of the most memorable stories. Cameroon failed to combine the Titanic's true story with the fairy tale relation of two characters. The actual ship was more of a back up character during the entire film, replaced by a sloppy love story that did not interest Cameroon. His passion was the ship, only, but he wasn't totally dumb. He had the smarts to know what would draw an audience.Characters: Jack and Rose. Left in the mist of real character building to focus more toward the ship. Ironically, the main characters seemed to be placed in front when it came to the actual screening, instead of the focus on the ship itself. Creating a ugly mix/mash of fiction to reality.Romance: Not a single true romantic moment went on during the course of their 24 hour relationship, aside from when they meet. All there was to it is a poor example of what we call true love. Jack and Rose go dancing under-deck, fine but not true romance. Jack gives Rose spitting lessons, gross and not romantic. Pose nude in front of one another, erotic and childish, so not romantic. The final hours of their short wasted relationship is spent by running around the ship and having sex, immature, childish, certainly not romantic. Finally after all they've been through he gives his life to save her. After all that there was not one memorable moment of their puppy love.All in all this was a dumb film that took two poorly, separate stories and fit them into place with pieces in the wrong place and some missing from the entire picture.Dicaprio and Winslet I can hardly blame, their performances were well acted.

831,GreyJug,Fabulous movie,9,23 July 2020,"This is a very good film, and the special effects in this film are done well. This film focuses on the tragedy of the sinking of the titanic but it still shows a lot of happiness like times when Jack and Rose spend time together before the titanic sinks so this film doesn't entirely give a sad feeling. Rose is pretty in this film and her romance with Jack is very nice in this film. I think that it is the right decision that Jack dies at the end of this film because it helps to show just how tragic the sinking of the titanic was. There has been good choices of music picked to be played in this film and the acting in this movie is good. Also Rose looks, talks and behaves in a way when she is 101 years old which is similar enough to when she is 17 years old for it to be believable that she is indeed the same person and this is an interesting idea. The tension as the titanic sinks is shown well in this film and it feels like the time it takes for the titanic to sink lasts longer than it does, which is a good idea because it makes it even more dramatic that way and when terrible things happen they often feel like they last for longer than they actually do.This film makes it clear just how awful the sinking of the titanic was, and shows it in a lot of detail. In the part of this film where Jack is chained to a room, the fear that he will drown is very evident and the build up of how the sinking of the titanic keeps getting worse is a good idea for this film; at first the titanic is not filled with much water but this keeps getting worse though. I like how as this ship sinks, people other than Jack and Rose are shown. There is a lot of detail in this film which all looks very real and the titanic in this film looks very big. Occasionally Kate Winslet's acting and Billy Zane's acting in this film could be better than it is and I don't think that Kate Winslet's American accent sounds very convincing. Also I think that what this film shows of what happens on the titanic before it sinks should show a bit more than it does of people other than Jack, Rose, Ruth and Cal because in real life there were a lot of passengers on the titanic so I think that this film should focus on more characters than it does at this point. Also I think that the part of this film where Cal tries to show people while on a sinking ship is not realistic enough. But I have much more good than bad to say about this movie which is why I have given it 9 out of 10.",Titanic
832,dandare4479,Filmmaking on the Grandest Scale,10,13 April 2017,"James Cameron does not do small films, even his breakout film The Terminator was hitting way above its budget. This is down to Cameron himself and his extreme work ethic to get the money right up there on the screen. This film often gets poor reviews from people, mainly due to its immense commercial success. However this success is truly deserving. There is no other film maker out there who can produce a film on this kind of scale and still pull it off. I was lucky enough to see it at the cinema in 1997. Straight off to even consider diving to the Titanic wreck itself to film it for the movie would be considered insane, Cameron did it 12 times. The film was pitched as Romeo and Juliet on Titanic and Cameron immediately got funded. The film ran massively over budget and there was huge concern at the time that the whole project would implode. However Cameron knew he was onto something special, creating a stunning replica of the Titanic itself, along with exact decor and furniture, props, clothing, even tableware. Cameron cast Romeo himself from the 1996 film Romeo and Juliet, Leonardo Di Caprio. This was a masterstroke as Di Caprio was gaining unrivalled stardom after the 1996 film. Kate Winslet is fantastic as Rose, as a young actress to have that level of scale all resting on your performance to make it all come to life, she pulled it off amazingly and often does not get the credit she deserves. The real star of the show though is the ship itself and its master film director James Cameron. When the ship starts sinking and Cameron moves into his action mode, there is no-one better in the world at pacing action them Cameron, he is a master of suspense at the exact right moments. He is an exceptional story teller and fully deserved all the accolades he has acquired. I highly recommend Titanic and encourage you to watch it on the largest screen possible, films like this do not come along often. The 3d Blu ray is also exceptional and shows what can be done when a 2d film is converted in the right hands into 3d.",Titanic
833,DannMarshall,Titantic,1,31 January 2008,"I find it so hard to believe that this film has done so well. The film shattered the box office within a week, and only Spiderman thus far has even been able to come close. The film Forrest Gump had brought in the most with over 300 million until this film came out. When you look at the list for highest grossing films now, Titanic shattered the numbers of Gump! This film is about a sinking ship and how there was only a few soul survivors. I mean come on!! There have been many great movies in this span of time but when you look at the numbers it kind of surprises you a little bit. The film was made by a brilliant director, and a wonderful cast, and won many awards. Within the first couple of weeks reached over 300 million which really is amazing. Still I wonder why own earth that this film did so well! Now in my opinion I do not really like Winslet or DiCaprio (aside from films like Departed) I will say that they worked very well, in this film. Another thing is the length of this film. The film is very long and winding. Did you really sit through this whole film when it was in the theaters? Again this is my opinion but personally I really had no interest when this film came out and had no interest in seeing it. I thought the original film is better, not what you see today. All of the special effects, graphics, etc. etc. I just find it so hard to believe that this film did so well, and no other film has been able to surpass it. Now when you look at other lists for movie production companies you will see that movies such as Star Wars, Pirates, Shrek 3, come to mind. This film really brought in a lot of money and in todays standards when so many films are losing their shirts this one must have its own special touch. Give me feedback. Thanks!",Titanic

Now about that big scene, I seem to not be able to stop thinking about it, yet it's not like I'm going to repeatedly picture her like that okay, it's only this film and only this film that this happens oh, and only during that particular scene. Titanic is a fantastic film, both Leo Decaprio and Kate Winslet make a great pair here, and do a terrific job too. I think Kat Winslet deserves another award for bravest actor, she was strong in this film, and I would assume she was also very comfortable doing that big scene. She had to be, I mean she was totally clothes less, and by the camera angles a lot her was seen while she was ""that way"". Anyway, Kate was great, Leo was great, this movie was great.

836,DanielStephens1988,Powerful Film About Finding The Will To Live,10,3 August 2020,"The true reason that Jack has to die doesn't lie in the physics of surviving in very cold water, but in the inner logic of the story. Jack has to die because he exists in order to empower Rose and give her the will to live. And once that story purpose is fulfilled, he's gone.I think we tend to fixate on the insanely iconic romance scenes and the sinking of the ship. But a big focus of the actual movie is on the theme of finding the will to live. From Roses perspective, it's as if Jack conveniently springs into existence precisely when she needs him to stop her from ending her life and reveal to her a better way out of her misery. The moment that Jack dies is also the moment when Rose finally commits wholeheartedly to not dying. Jack teaches Rose to keep the fire going within her to rekindle in her the desire to live.Before the Titanic hits the iceberg, money, expressed as the classes onboard, seems all-important, especially to the people in first class. But when we're facing down death, all the riches in the world are suddenly revelled to be worthless. The move illustrates this perfectly when Cal tries to bride First officer Murdoch for a seat on the lifeboat. But Murdoch is about to die; so what use is money to him? Therefore if your ship is going down what does it matter what class you're going to die in? Near the end of the movie, we're told Cal commits suicide after losing much of his money in the Crash of 29. So because Cal cant understand that money really isn't everything, it's as if he never actually learns what the value of life is. When the older rose throws the heart of the ocean into the water at the end, she's again rejecting Cal's value system and the idea that wealth matters anywhere near as much as those inner, spiritual things that drive us. So Rose is giving the heart of the ocean back to Jack and recognizing the way that he resorted her heart to her - helping her find the fire within that she needed to live this long, full life.Rose appears at the start to be the ""damsel in distress' type. But it quickly becomes clear that Rose is our real hero - she's the one who undergoes a complete transformation, and this is her story. Jack exists to service Rose's story. Jack purpose in Titanic is to enable Rose's character growth. Jack has given her all the tools necessary for her survival, so his role in the story is complete. And that, essentially is why he has to die at the end. Not because he can't fit on the door but because the story has no more use for him. In the later story, the crew searching for the diamond tell us they didn't find anything on Jack and there's no record of him. The story gives us an excuse for this - Jack won his ticket last minute in a poker game. But it seems intentional that the movie plants the tiniest seed of doubt as to whether Jack was really on the ship after all. At the end of Rose's life. Jacks memory is completely erased from the world, except for the indelible impact he's left on her - so he's alive only in her heart. It's a bit of a stretch to read Titanic as Rose's romance with a guy who's totally imaginary - of course, many others interact with Jack. But the point is that jack has a subtle air of unreality about him... he feels like some fantasy of a sexy life-coach that every girl needs from time to time to help her reorient her heart in the right direction.Jack is the piece of her that's missing. A woman getting in touch with her animus (Masculine Side) often involves finding strength of will and determination to act. These are things that historically, society hasn't really encouraged in women (espeically in 1912). But as soon as Rose merges with Jack, her animus, she becomes daring and holds, her own woman. In an incredibly accelerated timeline, she ditches her fiance and turns her back on her family and social class. Rose shows sexual agency, too, actively pursuing Jack in their romance. And after she has sex with Jack, Rose is assertive, holding and comforting him. When she arrives on the other shore, she assumes a new name in a new country. Taking his last name is a symbolic commitment to Jack, representing the idea that in her secret mind, she is forever married to him. But if we say that he's her animus her ""marriage' to this piece of herself would symbolize a promise that she'll never abandon her own agency and will again. Jacks death can be read as the moment when her animus ceases to be something sperate from her - and the result is Rose Dawson.So as much as our culture remembers Titanic for the romance, fittingly the deepest theme of this movie about so many tragic deaths is finding the will to live. In order for Rose to recapture her will to live, she needs to honestly face what's wrong in her life and cut that out. Committing to being alive means committing to living authentically as oneself.Great movie that sill holds up all these years. RIP James Horner & Bill Paxton",Titanic

When I remember those scenes when Kate takes the ax and enters the water to the head to reach the room where Leonardo is bound, an angry pass me. The complete set is enchanting. This is a movie that fully justified the funds invested and who for the reason earned a lot more money. Although the film was made in the late nineties, I can say that he is a classic for all time.

Let's face it, if DiCaprio isn't in the cast, this movie doesn't break the records. The performances were all half-way decent at best (I could have played Jack, it was that difficult of a part). But the special effects were nice. The plot was textbook romance and there was nothing surprising, even when Jack died. All in all, this movie was ok. I give it a 6 out of 10. If you want to see a real Cameron movie see ""True Lies"". That's a movie that has got it all. Fun, action, comedy, and a surprise here and there. Finally the main reason this movie could have been better is if the screenplay was better. ""Good Will Hunting"" won for best screenplay in '97 and they deserved it a lot more.

842,jmcsween90,"Boy meets Girl, Ship meets Iceberg",9,15 May 2001,"The most expensive movie of all time and the most successful of all time is a marvel of spectacle yet minimal on substance. Cameron's magnum opus has every element you'd expect from a Hollywood epic  romance, tragedy, historical grandeur, lavish sets and costumes, eye popping set pieces, and of course sexy actors  but somehow manages to achieve great results with the smallest amount of subtlety. The film begins in modern day Nova Scotia where a marine archaeologist (Paxton) stumbles across some tattered drawings whilst exploring the wreck of the famous ship for a priceless diamond. The drawing is that of a naked young woman who appears to be wearing the proverbial diamond of great price, and when Paxton's find is broadcast on TV it sparks off some memories in 101 year old Rose Calvert (Stewart). It transpires that Rose Calvert was in fact the socialite Rose DeWitt-Bukater who was supposed to have gone down with the ship some 84 years earlier. Of course that was not the case, and Cameron's film gives her the opportunity to set the record straight. In 1912 she was going to America to wed her thuggish fiancé Caloden Hockley (Zane), when in mid Atlantic she decides to throw off the shackles of her upper class oppressors and jump ship in a manner of speaking. Then she meets her knight in shining armour Jack Dawson (DiCaprio), a down on his luck travelling artist who saves her in every way a person can be saved (cue nauseating plot line). So they meet, he shows her the ways of the world by taking her to a party in steerage class, she leaves her fiancé, he teaches her to fly, paints her in the nude, they have sex, the ship sinks, he dies and her heart goes on  and on and on and on. So essentially it is just your classic tale of boy meets girl, ship meets iceberg. Despite all the hype and hoopla, Titanic' is quite a mesmerising piece of work that delivers an endless series of thumps to the heart while provide little if any food for thought. Although the characters are essentially black and white morally unambiguous personages, and the actor's thespian talents are not really challenged by the roles, and the dialogue has patches is purely prosaic (note when DiCaprio overhears the that the ship will sink he comments `This is bad'  very observant), the film has a great deal to compliment it. The opening underwater sequences are as eye catching as anything ever committed to celluloid, the vast shots of the ship in motion are breathtaking, and the attention to detail of the ship's interiors are flawless. However hackneyed the script may be, DiCaprio and Winslet inject their limited characters with endless charm, and the romantic romp is a shamelessly enjoyable roller coaster of fun and frolics. Yet it is only when the ship collides with the berg that the film kicks into first gear. The panic, terror and heartbreak of the sinking is viscerally recreated in all its gory horror, proving once and for all that James Cameron is the world's foremost director of action sequences. The aftermath is equally appalling, having to be seen to be believed.With a running time in excess of three hours this film could do with being a little shorter, and some of the sequences featuring the two leads trapped in the bowels of the sinking ship are excessive. Against its predecessor the highly commendable A Night To Remember', Titanic' can hold its own, primarily for its brutal depiction of the ship's final hours, however it has neither the historical accuracy nor the emotional depth of the former. Criticisms aside, Titanic' is the movie that will reinvent blockbusters for the 21st century, and while it is about a subtle as a hole in the head  or the hull if you must   you will not be likely to see a bigger film for many years to come.",Titanic

The plot is a poorly written, romantic piece of rubbish and the performances by DeCaprio and Winslet are mediocre. However, Billy Zane and Kathy Bates bring some some hope to the non-existent story line. Putting the plot and acting aside, Titanic is a technical milestone. The sequences where the Titanic sinks are nothing short of mind-blowing and you would think you are on the ship. It is lucky that the sinking of the ship is so brilliant, because after the length of time the viewer has to wait, it is much deserved.

852,achraj,Couldn't be any better than this.....,10,14 May 2012,"I saw this movie again and again & noticed more and more dedication and love for this movie..Titanic's central aspect is the love story between Jack and Rose, and the crush it has on Cal. The romantic story isn't original, but this is not a bad thing. Cameron re-invents the story to fit the time period and its characters. Everything fits perfectly, with nothing ever seeming contrived or awkward. Jack's immediate interest in Rose, and Rose likewise, is completely understandable. She is suffering emotionally, and Jack is there to support her. Themes from Romeo and Juliet are included, such as Rose being an upper-classman, and Jack being lower class. But the emotional connection between Rose and Jack is almost palpable, and this fuels the film's first two hours. We watch the trials of Jack and Rose, and as they overcome them, the ship comes closer to destiny. With a ship as large as the Titanic was, it was destined to crash. And of course, the ship isn't stocked with enough lifeboats to accommodate the 2,200 passengers. In the end, over 700 people survive, while the rest drown, freeze, or commit suicide. The resolution of the film, after the ship's gone under, is just as powerful as anything else in the movie. It ends rather surprisingly, with a touching symbolic conclusion. Most films end predictably, or inappropriately, but Titanic ends just on the right note. In fact, the symbolism of the final scene is so perfect, that many people will contemplate over the meaning for months. The film does end rather depressingly, and unexpectedly, but when you think about it, it couldn't have ended any other way. All the questions are answered, and we are left with a weak smile due to the intense situation we were just put through. The Titanic sinking is an emotional roller coaster, with many more realistic deaths than any Independence Day. The death scenes are so realistic, that you find yourself caring for every single passenger. Cameron never compromises the integrity of his film, and the deaths of the passengers is never overemphasized. He doesn't linger on each death, but takes it as it comes to show us the realism without trying to force emotions out of the audience. But emotions do show, and almost anyone will find themselves wiping away a few tears. Hats off for this masterpiece..!",Titanic
853,blackwolf14016,What else can I say?,10,13 May 2003,"This movie is excellent. That's all I can really say.I'm not even going to go into the plot - There are thousands of reviews online, you can see it there.My Review:When this movie came out in 1997, I was 13 years old, maybe a year into pueberty. At that time, I had just discovered my passion for free-weights (Bench Press was, and still is, my fav). My hormones were in full swing, producing more testosterone then I knew what to do with.My buds and I, like everyone else in the bloody world, had heard of the ""Epic Romance"" and laughed that it was a complete chick flick. We 'boycotted' the movie, saying we would never go see it in a million years.
Well, after it had been out for about 4 months, I went and saw it with my little sister and her friend (who were 9 and begged to see it, but my dad had been reluctant due to the PG-13 rating). I sat in the back row, while they sat in the front. There were still a fair ammount of people there, 4 months after release.I sat through the 3 hours, without even going to the bathroom. I would never admit it to my buds, but I cried at the end. Not weeping or anything, just tears. I quickly wiped them away before walking my sister and her friend out.When I told my friends about it, I told them ""Yeah, it was so fu$!ing funny when that idiot Jack died! I laughed my a@@ off!"" Of course it was complete BS, but I couldn't tell them the truth. But I bet that the first time they saw the movie, they cried as well.And THAT is the kind of movie this was. It was that touching.
I don't like Romance flicks at all, but I did this one. I can't put into words why, I just did.A lot of people bash this movie (even my friends and I now think of it as a great movie, just as a great 'chick flick' movie) but I have no idea why. Some people bash the special effects (please, they were superb), the plot (it was GREAT damnit!) or the historical relevancy (it was very accurate, except of course for Jack and Rose). I say let em' bash it. Why bother to try to change their opinions? Some people find fault with everything.My favorite aspect of the movie would have to be the cinemetography. The shots were just so damn good.My 2nd favorite would be the soundtrack (and let me tell you, I'm normally a hard rap/hip-hop fan). I don't like Celine Deon, but the theme song was excellent.The acting was A+, nothing much to say. I loved Bernard Hill as Captain Smith especially, tho probably because of his role in LOTR :)I urge all of you to watch this movie. It may be the best of our lifetimes.

No, its not the best film I've seen, but it certainly comes close to being. James Cameron is a true genius and he's the person to thank.Titanic is a wholesome tragedy adapted from the historic event when more 1000 people lost their lives. This film is pure art and will never be forgotten. It is filled with extravaganza effects, worthy performances, and a simply adorable soundtrack.Leonardo DiCaprio gives one of his best performances in his career. He is simply perfect as Jack; simple, yet humanized. Kate Winslet is even better, playing Rose with Gratitude, courage, and efficiency. This is also, simply her best performance in her career.Effects are simply breathtaking. James Cameron provides with stuff that you would have never seen in the 90s. As for his direction, also benefits because of his stretchy camera angles and glorious sights. This is seriously Cameron at his BEST and there's nothing more wonderful than that.Small things like soundtracks don't usually matter in films, but this film has the best I have heard in my life! Racy, touching, and emotional; there isn't anything like it.Overall, I have no words for Titanic. Almost everything is near-perfect in this timeless classic.

But when I finished watching this movie I just wanted to watch it all over again. I have seriously never seen such an entertaining and good quality movie. I had watched parts of this movie a few years ago. Today I watched the whole thing for the first time in my life (I'm 15) and I cannot believe that someone could of produced a movie this good. The acting was so good I almost forgot that I was watching a movie. I cannot believe that someone had actually tried to make a second one because there is no way in hell it could beat this.Lets also face it, Leonardo was extremely enjoyable to look at. I highly recommend this movie to anyone. It doesn't matter what type of movies you like, I'm pretty sure Titanic covers all types of movies and you simply can't beat it.

I always loved learning about the titanic as a kid and I'll never forget when my aunt gave me this movie and I watched it. Obviously a lot went over my head as a kid and rewatching it as an adult it has a lot of really funny scenes if I'm being totally honest. Like the fact Rose did marry after Jack and just never told anyone her ""last name"" is actually her dead ex boyfriends name and she has kids even grandkids with this new dude but when she dies she's with Jack and not the guy she had a family with is really funny. I mean just imagine being her husband and waiting for her to join you in the after life only to find out she was hoeing it up on the titanic again with her ex haha. All the jokes aside though, phenomenal film. Gorgeous cinematography, great cast. Extremely great story and very suspenseful. If you haven't seen it... why're you reading a review marked with spoilers? Shame on you, your mother and I are very disappointed with you. Go watch it now.",Titanic

A fictionalized account of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, it stars Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.I love the film very much. Every time I am moved to tears. I am filled with heartrending sorrow. However the heroine live strongly after the parson who she loves, so I am encouraged. The music of the film is also good. I love the song, My Heat Will Go on, sung by Celine Dion. The film contains love story element and panic element, so we never lost interest in the film.

859,albertsmith-32785,A great adventure film that will make you obsessed with the Titanic.,9,1 August 2018,"Titanic was a massive success upon release and still continues to be immensely popular. It is easy to see why: Jim Cameron is a master filmmaker and the set for the film- the ship itself is so awe inspiring you'd be fooled into thinking this was the real ship. The film is incredibly well paced- despite being quite long and the casting is top notch. Titanic made stars out of Kate Winslet and Leonardo Di Caprio and they are quite good here. One can see why Leo became a heartthrob after this film came out- he is very good. Jim Cameron has a passion for the Ocean and he seems right at home directing Titanic. Its funny to think that Titanic's box office record was eventually broken by his own Avatar, which is a testament to his talent as a storyteller and filmmaker.",Titanic
860,redeagle717,Awful,4,16 January 2006,"It is insulting to think that this film was well-received. I guess it would be tragic if a film this well shot and expensive was turned down. Think about it, for one, Leonardo DiCaprio, as usual, delivers a crappy performance that is almost laughable, and so does Kate Winslet and the other people in the cast. Secondly, there is no great story- it is just a love story in the midst of an event that everyone knows about. Thirdly, the only reason it won Best Picture at the Oscars was because of the ending which is often mocked in commercials and the main song which is recognizable to anyone. The only reason it was a Box Office success was because it's the Titanic! It is a major event- no one was looking for a love story! Nothing goes for this movie except special effects and a nice song- PATHETIC!",Titanic

It will surely have its place as a classic for years to come. For the monumental budget and phenomenal cast, it lives up to its hype. James Cameron did a superfluous recreation of the tragic ill-fated voyage. The personal drama and romance only further pull us in and connect us with the past. We ""feel"" the pleasure, the pain, the loss with the characters, vicariously though the vivid sets, dynamic characters and heartwrenching plot.Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet were truly cheated at the awards; but their performance in TITANIC will be well-remembered for years to come.It is truly a masterpiece in its own time.

(true lies is one of my favorite movies!)  i gave this movie a three.  the script was horrible.  i was dying of laughter right there in the theater in front of all the teary eyed girls, i mean the girl next to me was actually crying (her-""oh not leo!"" me-""excuse me, i am trying to nap here!"")  it took like a whole day the watch the borefest. 5 hours of crap before the iceberg hit.  then when the boat crunched and cracked that was pretty good.  the best part of the movie takes about a nanosecond.  that is when some guy falls and like hits his head on a boat propeller and starts twirling around.  i was rolling with laughter.  other than that....zzzzz.  and the crap with that old chick was played out!  who cares about these uninteresting people?  i wanted them to crash into the iceberg and then have polar bears leap out onto the deck and start mauling people.  then arnold would show up (because this is james camaron) and like take no prisoners or something.  i don't know...anything to end my suffering.",Titanic

I went in pessimistic, but was impressed with how accurate it was.  This movie deserves 7/10 stars simply based upon its historical accuracy.  It earns the rest for cinematograpy.The problem Cameron had to face is that the story of a sinking ship itself is not enough to give a movie a plot to follow.  Jack and Rose and Cal were placed on Cameron's Titanic merely to give Cameron an excuse to show you the ship end to end, top to bottom, without boring you completely.  Sure, the acting could have been better from the principles, but they were not the point of this movie...merely a subplot, as I see it.  (By the way, I felt the supporting cast was wonderful...they played their real-life counterparts with accuracy.)If you didn't like this movie, try reading about Titanic a little bit, and then watch it again...PS-I AM a Star Wars fan, and I liked this movie...go figure.",Titanic
866,gsprods,It changed my life.,10,4 January 2000,"There is a backlash brewing, especially amongst imdb fans who suddenly brought Titanic down from the #1 ranking to out of the top 250. Fine, you win. The film will just have to settle for the all time box office record and tied for the most Academy Awards. It is interesting that most of these Titanic haters did not see the film when it first came out, and didn't even see it in theatres at all. The longer you waited to see the film, the more difficult it would be to watch it objectively. Many of these Titanic haters never wanted to see the film to begin with and went out of their way to tear it down when given the opportunity to finally see it. Those of us like myself who saw the film in theatres during the early weeks were able to watch it more objectively. I expected it to be well directed and technically impressive. James Cameron directed The Terminator, the most intense and relentless thriller I have ever seen. Aliens redefined the sci fi/horror film. What I was not expecting was that I would be crying at the end of Titanic, the first film to make me cry since Ghost. As a man, one who loves Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, L.A. Confidential, etc., I was caught completely off guard and became very emotional during the last half hour of the film. I cannot explain it and don't want to explain it, but I will never forget this film because it somehow got these feelings outside of my otherwise stoic self. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart broke my heart, and James Horner's score perfectly set the mood for me. I paid to see the film several times (and sneaked in to see the ending many more times.)  The total amount of time and money I put into watching this film is a bargain compared to the many hours of therapy sessions I otherwise could have had. The feelings the film inspired in me (normally well hidden) has since enabled me to become a more open, emotional, giving, well rounded person. That is the highest praise I can say of this film. It changed my life.",Titanic

872,ryanaustinf,WAAY Underrated!,7,5 June 2009,"I think James Cameron might be becoming my favorite director because this is my second review of his movies. Anyway, everyone remembers the RMS Titanic. It was big, fast, and ""unsinkable""... until April 1912. It was all over the news and one of the biggest tragedies ever. Well James Cameron decided to make a movie out of it but star two fictional characters to be in the spotlight instead of the ship. Well, onto the main review but let me remind you that this is all opinion and zero fact and the only fact that will be present is an event from the film.So our two main characters are Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslet). They're not annoying too much but watch this and you'll find out why they could become annoying ( http://tinyurl.com/ojhoyn ). The main villain I guess is bad luck, fate, hand of God (no blasphemy intended), or just plain Caledon Hockley (Billy Zane). Combine all of the above and what do you get?! Oh yes! We get a love story on a sinking boat. The supporting characters are the following: My personal favorite, Mr. Andrews (Victor Garber)(idk he was so nice), Lovejoy(David Warner), Murdoch(Ewan Stewart), Lightoller (Jonathan Phillips), Captain Smith(Bernard Hill), Molly Brown(Kathy Bates), and many more. We also got the present day treasure hunter, Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton). They add something to the story, something good. The action in here is awesome, especially in the second half, the drama as also good. In the end you can have your eyes dropping rainstorms or silent tears. The story is simple and it works. A treasure hunter seeks the Heart of the Ocean and instead finds a drawing of a woman wearing the said diamond. She calls and tells her tale on the RMS Titanic. Two lovers separated by social class and ultimately, the fate of the ship. Everything about the story works and there are very few flaws. I give Titanic, an 86% awesome",Titanic

Many of the scenes in the movie stay with you after you've watched it. Not just the tragedy or romance, but the vast gap presented amongst the 'rich' and 'poor', who are treated in proportion with their money. I absolutely love this movie.",Titanic
874,filmsbythefire,Deserves a higher rating,10,15 April 2010,"I have to say, when it comes to romantic flicks, people seem to go to extremes (and I admit, I've done it too, giving Titanic a ten). It seems you either love it with a vengeance and woe betide anyone who doesn't agree, or you hate it so passionately you would happily murder the poor actors and actresses simply for appearing in it.This is ridiculous. While I do enjoy the film, I have no problems with people who didn't, and if they dislike the romance then that's their opinion, which they're entitled to. Seriously, why turn it into something? Personally speaking, this is still one of my favourite films, and I saw it years after it came out (as always) so the success had ebbed away. But unlike so many, I didn't go with expectations. All those people who went for a documentary on the disaster, or endless shots of old Leo... I saw it without expecting anything. I didn't give a monkeys about DiCaprio, I knew next to nothing about the actual disaster, and I was simply hoping it deserved its record-breaking 11 Academy Awards. And I thought it did, frankly.The acting was top-notch, the music was wonderful, the visuals were stunning. While the romance was indeed stereotypical and contrived (and I gave this a ten), it was still pulled off excellently, and I really did feel for the character, which is a mark of a good film. I don't think that the ending spoilt the film, which many people think it did. I am not saying that they are wrong, or that I am right, because that's not true. It's about opinions. I just thought it was a nice touch - a sort of backhanded happy ending to round off an otherwise rather depressing Now-they'll-never-see-each-other-again scenario. I thought the film had many, many memorable moments, and the disaster itself was not downplayed - it fitted smoothly around the romance, which incidentally helped to give a sense of perspective to the whole thing. Many couples really will have been torn apart that night, albeit probably not from different classes. The sheer drama unfolding on-screen cannot really be questioned. It can be disliked, of course. But it is good acting nevertheless.",Titanic
875,tristandetwiler,Nothing on Earth Could come Between them. What kind of stupid Promotional Tagline is that?,10,21 December 2013,"Short one this time... might happen with movies that aren't on my Top 30 Favorite Movies of all Time List.Plot:If you want a historical representation of the Titanic story, just go watch A Night to Remember. The whole movie centers around a fictitious love story used to give the movie it's core appeal. It's whats used to connect the audience to the historical event. However, the story has gone beyond that. It's amazing to hear how modern teenagers and stupid children didn't know the Titanic was a real ship.Characters:Card-board cut out representations of real people on the Titanic and 2-D Personality characters (Fictional) thrown in for drama. I think Jack is the most bland character ever written in a motion picture. Cal Hockley is the star of the movie. Yes, he's the hero of the film. I was rooting for him, not the bizarre couple who acted like a#%holes.Visuals:Where the film shines easily. James Cameron labored to make the movie as historically accurate as possible. It's actually mind-blowing how complex and faithful the sets are to the real ship. The dresses, suits, attire, and objects used in the movie are key perfect for a period piece. The effects of the ship sinking are also very nice. The fact he used a real set and not Computer Generated Images is a good enough reason, but it looks great in the final picture.Sound:The score by James Horner is also very nice. It's a great mix of triumph, sadness, happiness, tragedy, and hope. The different tracks sound right for the situation. Some musical tracks that are used, for example, in the beginning of the movie, are interjected later into the movie to give the score a mix of, again, happiness and tragedy.Enjoyment:The movie had sell-out crowds for a year... it made over one billion dollars and was, at the time, the most successful film ever made.

Apparently Titanic is already a very big success around the world and has won 11 Oscars! Quite a lot! I saw the Titanic movie three times already. The actors played brilliantly and Titanic has one of the best pictures I've ever seen. It was very succeeded! Titanic has a very good music, best costumes, best decoration, best story... It is one of the best film I've seen in my life!!! It was very emotional like film and very beautiful, charming and sad at the same time. The end made me cry in my head. It was so well done! I can't believe that Titanic is such a popular movie! The only thing I didn't like was that the film was TOO LONG!!! Actually, I didn't really mind. It is a very dramatic story. The music was so soft and relaxing and make us dream a lot! The music described very well what was happening in the film and the character's feelings!!! Really enjoyable!!! James Cameron is a true genius. I haven't seen Titanic in 3D but I hope that the 3D was excellent. It was a very good story of love! I could recommend it to little and great children to see it! They might love it! The ship was pretty and wonderfully made!!! Pictures are really amazing. Titanic isn't really the ""kind"" of film that I prefer the most but now I realized how good it was!

877,MoviesAreLife93,A shining gemstone among American films,10,30 December 2013,"This film is a masterpiece. Every aspect of its production weaves together in a beautiful tale of tragedy, peril, and romance. The tremendous amount of effort that James Cameron and the entire cast put into this production is the essential reason that Titanic should never be forgotten, and should always be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. This movie is a true work of art - and the acting, the production value, directing, visuals,and music score all contribute. I doubt very much that there will ever be a film that portrays the fate of Titanic with such elegance as this one. Although this film runs well over three hours, there is not one wasted scene. This deserved every Oscar it received, and I consider its rating of a 7.7/10 to be a borderline travesty; it should easily be in the top 250 if not an 8.5/10 or greater. I love this movie!",Titanic
878,lbabe29,One of the greatest films of all time- A dazzling romantic epic,10,6 June 2010,"Its been 13 years since James Cameron award winning epic hit the theatres and took the world by storm. Even after all these years Titanic is just as impressive, this is truly a film that will never lose its power, easily on par with the classic epic ""Gone With The Wind"" and in my personal opinion it may even be better.The romance between the beautiful upper class Rose (winslet) and the poor,charming Jack (dicaprio) is truly one of the most beautiful and touching ever put to screen. Theirs is a romance so passionate, trusting and ultimately tragic is hard not to be moved. Rose and Jack also happen to be one of the greatest and most memorable couples in cinema history.A massive part of making this couple so memorable its the wonderful performances from Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Winslet is captivating as the spirited Rose, you really feel her inner torment at her restricted life, her overbearing mother and controlling husband-to-be Cal. Dicaprio lights up the screen with his charm, easily one of the best actors of his generation he gives another strong, highly natural performance as the free spirited jack. As a character Jack is also incredibly likable, the ideal man in all respects, its very easy to see why Rose could fall so head over heels for this handsome artist. Winslet and Dicaprio also have extraordinary chemistry making their performances even better as they play perfectly off one another. Supporting cast also do a great job, Kathy Bates gives a great warmth and sense of humour to Molly Brown, Billy Zane is brilliant as Cal, providing just enough to make him the perfect villain but there is a sense of humanity there to. Frances Fisher playing Rose's cold and snobbish mother Ruth is perfect in everyway. Simply put James Cameron knows how to direct, he has a knack for creating these thrilling, visual masterpieces that rival anything we have ever seen (Titanic,Avatar). Titanic is an epic through and through, the sets are incredible and the cgi is still highly impressive (in fact it is miles better than 99% of todays cgi). You actually feel you are on the Titanic yourself such is the care and attention to detail within this film. The last act which involves the sinking of the ship is possibly some of the most thrilling pieces of cinema ever captured. This is Hollywood at its best.Camerons writing skills are less impressive, this is far from a perfect, mind blowing script but it is a good one nonetheless. There are some wonderful exchanges between Jack and Rose as they begin their love affair and thanks to a mixture of talented actors and sweet dialogue it all works wonderfully. My only, very minor issue with the dialogue would be the overuse of ""jack"" and ""rose""...for example i believe Rose utters the word ""jack"" 78 times, Cameron seems to forget that we don't actually use peoples names 24/7....however this is just a very minor fault and really does nothing to spoil the film what-so-ever. There are some cheesy lines (as would be expected in a romance) but they work thanks to the actors delivering them, they are uttered with such passion,heartbreak,joy that they end up sounding natural and in fact totally in place.The score by James Horner is breaktaking, a soundtrack of epic proportions to say the least. Horner succeeds in creating a score that is larger than life and at the same time highly unconventional. He knows when to be soft and subtle which is hard to find in most soundtracks today. Arguably some of his best work this score only furthers this films breaktaking execution. Despite minor script flaws and some small historical inaccuracies Titanic is still in my mind a perfect film. Such is the level of care put into this film, such is the level of talent from everyone to the stunt men, actors,set designers etc that any flaw is soon forgotten or even better not even noticed. This film is a touching,beautiful romance, its an epic thriller, its a period piece and its an action film....this film has everything any audience member could ever want and it strikes a perfect balance between them. One of the greatest films of the 20th Century Titanic is an epic like no other.",Titanic

To say the least I was very disappointed.The acting was very laughable, Winslet's, and DiCaprio's characters displayed no chemistry whatsoever, Gloria Stuart's character displayed almost no emotion, and no one else in this film put forth a great effort for their character.I think that the thing that really set me off was the relentless hype that followed this film around everywhere. If a film is going to be constantly hyped about, it had better be excellent, otherwise, it will suck.Titanic is probably the worst ""Best Picture"" of the 1990's, and it seemed to have won by default. 1997 was a bad year for films, and Titanic just goes to show you that.

885,DB-55,Big budget depiction of Titanic sinking,8,30 September 1999,"Whoever makes a movie about the most famous shipwreck of all time will inevitably run the gauntlet of criticism for this part or that part being correct/not correct. In general Cameron's version is a reasonably correct version of the known facts ( not including the two fictional lead roles ). Some points about the crews behaviour ( particularly Lightoller ), as shown in the movie are open to debate, however the whole truth will never be fully known. One fact that never seems to have been mentioned in any movie to date (that I know of) is that the White Star line was part of the American I.M.M shipping combine owned by American tycoon John Pierpont Morgan. The vessel was crewed by British officers to give the impression of a British operation. Therefore Morgan ( who was extremely proud of Titanic  and devastated by her loss ) would have taken a great interest in her specifications. Of course ultimately Captain Smith and those on board issuing orders must shoulder any blame for Titanic's sinking. Apart from disputes over historical facts the film is magnificent. Few directors would be able to control such a huge production as Cameron has. The set's are stunning and the computer graphics top of the line. The movie's 3 hours seem to pass very quickly. The love sub-plot is well constructed and ably acted ( although Leonardo Di Caprio seems a touch lightweight in places ). Billy Zane and David Warner both stand out as villains and of course there is the lovely Kate Winslet in fine acting form. A must for any video library.",Titanic
886,svswinger-2,A Joke,1,24 November 1999,"I can't begin to express how bored I was with this movie. It's not that it was a poorly made movie. I understand the movies appeal to the romantics at heart, but that still does not validate it as the best movie of all time. It was boring, far too long, and completely uninteresting. I've always thought the movie could have stood on it's own as a much more fascinating film if the first half had never been made. Cameron did a tremendous job of showing the horror and hopelessness the members of the ship felt while the ship was sinking. But it took so long to finally arrive at this point in the movie, it was almost impossible to get back into it by that time.  This movie was thoroughly uninteresting, and the only redeeming factor that comforts me is that there will never be a sequel. 1/10",Titanic

We all knew it would sink, thats the whole reason why i saw the movie.(NOTE: im a bloke and did NOT see it Leo whatshisface).the story revolves around two classes, the third class where Jack (Leo) and his mate (a terific Danny Nucci, puting on an accent), win 2 tickets to America, on the new 'Unsinkable' ship TITANIC.the other people are Rose (Winslet) her fiancee' Cal (Zane, another splendid role) and her mother Ruth (Fischer). Also travelling in the first class are Bruce Ismay (Hyde), the ships designer Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber). when jack saves rose from an attempt at suicide, their romance blossoms into a passiontate affair aboard the doomed vessel.the story is told in 1996, when a picture of a nude winslet is found, a woman claiming to be her shows up (Stewart), to tell her tale to Paxton. He is looking for a rare diamond (why is it blue i ask? should that be a sapphire?) which she was wearing in the picture.A brilliant cast in a brilliant film, written and directed by a very tallented man. but the best performance comes from Kathy Bates as ""The Unsinkable Molly Brown"".Dont miss it 9/10",Titanic

The dialogue is beyond cheesy, and the scene where Kate Winslet spit on Billy Zane is like something out of a grade-Z soap opera.  I didn't believe a second of this film - it is extraordinarily fake in every respect.

This film represents the fall of Great Britain in the years ahead, Titanic was a British ship and had everything going for it, until it hit an iceberg after being manipulated by people only interested in money and power. The same thing is happening to Britain now and it won't be long until Britain hits that iceberg. I'm sorry I couldn't serve the country I love and every time this film is on I play the violin and weep tears of sorrow because I failed my beautiful country. The acting in the film was top notch, as were the special effects and the dialogue. However the sheer sadness of the film, all those lives lost and also the way it kinda predicts the future deeply saddens me and makes me suicidal every time I see it and for that reason I can't give it more than 8 stars. I would've given it 9 stars before the referendum but now it's 8 stars. May those that died on the Titanic rest in peace.",Titanic

If you watched it when you were young, please watch it again because it is the defenition of a masterpiece. Altough Di Caprio and Winslet were on their early ages, they were fantastic. Chemistry was as good as it can be. Exquisite writing. When the movie is based on a real story it is harder to be creative. James Cameron did a spectacular job in writing and his world-class directing, because of him we are able to call this movie a classic. Amazing visual effects especially for 1997.

Aside from the presence of the genuinely talented DiCaprio and some admittedly visually striking scenes of the boat's sinking, the film (as any film is) is absolutely mortally impaired by Cameron's Jack and Jill simple script of poor but good boy loves rich but trapped in evil high society girl who are then tragically parted by cruel fate while their love is still young, sweet and fresh. If only genuine real life were actually like this perhaps films like this could be enjoyable, but any sensitive, perceptive mature adult knows that (perhaps unfortunately) that it just ain't so. Cameron is certainly, though, an extremely talented action director with the directing credits of Aliens and Terminator 2 to his name, he just shouldn't write his own scripts as in this department his insight and understanding of the depth and complexity of the genuine human experience is seriously lacking. I'll just keep rewatching Aliens and T2 and hoping that Cameron hires Frank Darabont (who wrote The Shawshank Redemption) to write his scripts, or stays firmly in the director's chair.",Titanic
892,dostan-85075,Zarina,10,15 October 2019,"I saw this film long ago but remember that it took my breath away and we are still talking about this movie.
The fictional story of two main actors was absolutely beautiful. Kate Winslet was gorgeous as Rose and i couldn't imagine anyone else playing this role. And Leonardo DiCaprio was really good as Jack. The acting is first-rate. Leonardo Di Caprio's and Kate Winslet's performance is so brilliant that I cried during the whole movie.
This movie has it all; drama, action, romance and it makes the viewer fall in love with each and every scene. Also it is very close to the real tragedy. It shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending.It's emotionally so powerful that it breaks the viewer into tears.
If you want to cry and melt down to a glamurous love story, I strongly recommend that you watch this movie. Titanic is well worth seeing.AizereTitanic is very tough movie to watch and this film is directed by James Cameron.The film is not new, but does not go out of fashion, does not leave indifferent even a person who is used to constantly hide emotions. Shown fear and love. It is instructive and even interesting to look at the behavior of people from the side, as if with the actors of the film you are experiencing what is happening in the film. Sometimes it seems that this is reality, but pincing yourself by the arm you understand that this is only a film. There is no pretense in the game of actors, it pleases me.I really liked the film, I can't even say exactly what, just EVERYTHING with which it was made. Watching it, I feel myself there on the Titanic, after the film I immediately begin to have a value in life, I would never want to die like these people who were on board. I would even like to see the Titanic myself with my own eyes at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean.The film has touched my soul so much that I don't think there is a film that will surpass the Titanic in its drama. This is my favorite movie from melodramas, and one of my favorite films in general. I really advice to watch this masterpiece.",Titanic

They ruin a tragic moment in history by making a tragic movie. The movie focuses way to much on a cheesy love story that is extremely pointless, I mean, if the dude dies, why the flip would they make a freaking 3 hour movie about making sexual pictures and extremely slow story, and then... he drowns after she says, ""I'll never let go, Jack, so here, I'll just let your body go into the cold depths,"" DOES THAT REALLY FREAKING MAKE SINCE AT ALL?! The only good part in the movie was when he died, I was so happy because he wouldn't shut up. And right now, my cousin is trying to murder me with an iPod cord while Im badly commenting her all time favorite movie. I think if I was this age right now and I saw it in theaters, I would laugh because of the extreme slowness. But I did like the visual effects, they were pretty good, the special effects weren't that good though.

It's a great performance by Leonardo and it's a shame he didn't get a nomination because that's the one this film truly deserved. Sure, the special effects were impressive but so were the effects in Predator. AND, James Cameron once wrote a letter to the L.A.

The current trend being that people are already bored with computer animations that plagued us since the ""Lion King"" means there is still hope to get a discerning public. The problem with Titanic is that the storyline is too ""linear"", too much, too fast, and not enough time is given to get a good picture of the characters. Don't get me wrong, it is an entertaining movie, with fantastic pictures and a lot of action. However, the only attempt at showing characters as they should be is in the (near) final post-disaster scene between Di Caprio and Winslet.

Don't get fooled into thinking this movie is bad by these other idiots. It's just because all the teeny boppers liked it which means they can't like or they will be viewed as *****S.Let's just say if this movie wasn't overhyped and didn't make as much money, nothing bad would have been said. It's also not on the IMDB 250 list because all the hoi polloi don't own computers (or don't come to this site) and can't voice their opinions like the Fight Club crowd here (me included).I thought Leo and Kate were awsome and I thought the script was great. It is very easy in life to bash something people put a lot of work into. Why don't you go try acting or writing a script or hell -even getting a job.People here bashed the dialogue. Why? Well, because like I said -they are idiots. Listen to people in day to day talk, listen to yourself as you talk to your girlfriend, wife or whoever, no one talks in poetry or in artsy dialogue. The dialogue in this movie is accurate. That IS how everyday people talk!I think James Cameron did a brilliant job and had a lot of balls for making such a costly picture. I am so glad Pearl Harbor was a failure because while Cameron WAS really trying to make a film, the Pearl Harbor Team & Disney were just out for money.You can't say J Cameron was out for money, nothing this big had every been done and he was at risk of losing a lot of money.

900,loopmyworld,Movie which touched the core of my heart !!!!!!!,10,29 May 2012,"The movie opens as researchers try to find out diamonds inside the wreck of the real titanic, which gives us the first full look of the wreck of the unsinkable ship which was a bit emotional. Bill Paxton finds 85 years old diary which hold the drawing of the naked women & then later on it's been telecast on TV. The movie goes into flashback & here comes the glimpse of the beautiful ship titanic. The bunch of characters appear in the movie at the port of Belfast, which also includes the male leading start Leonardo winning the ticket of titanic on the lucky hand of poker. The movie literally gives you the feeling of viewer being inside of the ship & according to the facts everything in the movie is been re-designed from the furniture to the decks, lamps, the door way, life boats, & along with the engine room.The real movie beings after Rose decides to suicide jumping from the rear end of the ship & Jack take her mind off the track & saves her. As the movie continues Jack & Rose starts to meet up regularly at the different parts of the ship, while on the other hand Rose mother & her fiancé Cal doesn't like Rose spending time with lower class standard jack, but still young hearts were attracted to each other. The best scene in the movie according to me is the flying scene of Jack & Rose, which makes rose realize that she is in love with Jack too. The movie takes sudden turns when on the same night titanic hits the iceberg, which in short left my eyes wide open, as it has been directed & executed very well, & then the final chapter of the maiden voyage beings the sinking of the unsinkable titanic. The final hour of the movie filled with reality & the disaster which people till now hasn't forgotten. People struggling to survive & the real history how traveler's were saved into the life boats are the key scenes of the movie. Some true scenes like the Creator of titanic Thomas Andrews died while standing near the dining clock & was last seen, the steamer falling on the jacks brother, third class traveler's were treated during the sinking scenes. The breaking apart of ship are the most shattering scenes in the movie. There is no doubt even today in 2012 still I wonder what James Cameron has achieved in the special effects put into this movie, the year 1997 the worked on their best special effects effort to keep this movie alive even for the upcoming generation to watch on. The soul of the movie is the background score of this motion picture which is composed by James Horner every piece of music is been composed specially to suit the scenes of this movie itself, from the opening sequence to de-porting of titanic to Rose theme & the sinking sequence. James Cameron specially recorded the score of the movie with real orchestra the team of James Horner. In one the interviews of the making of Avatar one of the viewer asked him "" what if you get a chance to direct Titanic again, what would be your experience in making it "" ?? and he answer if I would have been given a change to direct titanic again, I will finish titanic within a month very easily cause of hugely availability of special effects team, cause for titanic I had to wait for some shot for days. For example the shot of Rose & Jack on the front end of the ship kissing each other, he had to wait for days to get proper sunset in the camera as special effects that time weren't that advanced like how they are today. In one word you're a legend Cameron. The wreck shot of ship were taken in the year 1995 2 years before the releasing the movie into theaters. Till now whenever I watch this movie I still feel I'm watching it for the first time & somewhere there are tears in my eyes specially in the scene where rose steps into the life boats & Jacks watches her going away, oh geez that particular scene gets tears in my eyes every time. I am now waiting for the special edition of this movie to be released in 3d blu-ray. True facts about TITANIC Titanic was constructed to be unsinkable ship of that time, but the creator of the ship Thomas made 3 biggest mistakes in constructing the ship. The propeller of the ship were taken directly from the design of the 18's century cruise liner, the water tight compartments had one the major flaws which over flowed the water from the upper decks, the propellers turning radius was not designed to turn ship quickly as the ship size was way bigger than the propellers could bear it during the full stern. On the night of sinking titanic received 5 iceberg warning, but still they ignored the warning & continue sailing. The final decision by the Mr Murdoch to reverse the engines & turning the ship to evade iceberg. The decision not to carry enough life boats cause it ruins the overall look of the top deck & it was initially decided to carry just 8 life boats, but later on more 12 boats were added. The distress call from titanic was actually received by the local streamer waiting for the morning to sail again couldn't reach for help as the streamer couldn't see the titanic as the sky was full of twinkling stars which interrupted the them to see through binoculars.The crew lost their binoculars on the night ship hitted the iceberg.My rating – 10/10 !!!!!!!",Titanic
901,dockbennett,Bad and Good - no other film like it,6,7 April 2012,"I first saw ""Titanic"" in fairly early 1998, I think, here in Australia. I went with a girl I had recently got to know on the Internet. She had already seen it, and spoke in raptures about it after we left the cinema, while I was hesitating somewhat, as I was not sure about what I had just witnessed. Since then, I have seen the film at least twice more, including just now, and I stick by my opinion that I have never seen a movie that is so bad and so good at the same time. The bad, as so many people have said, is the script. Well, the characters too. The main romance is so embarrassingly contrived as to be juvenile, and this is not helped by the character of Rose. Quite frankly, I can't stand her, and can only wonder why Jack did not push the little brat off the ship when he had the chance. Speaking of Jack, I liked him. He and Molly Brown were, by far, the two best characters shown. I'm not bagging the acting of Winslett. I think she did well. I just thought her character was loathsome. Not much better is Cal. I couldn't stand him either, and yes, I know you're not meant to like him, but I didn't like the way I didn't like him! Talk about a corny villain. Snobby, cowardly... by the time he picked up the child to get his way off the ship, I was thinking, ""Alright, we get the idea. He's a creep."" Really, I thought the whole ""first class and the rest"" concept was overdone. Yes, I know it was an issue, but it's so clumsy and obvious as to be cringe worthy. But probably the worst and most disappointing character was the captain. Here was someone I would have loved to got to know. Ultimately, the sinking was all his fault. Yet there was no depth to him, instead just coming off as a feeble human being who did and said little, and who looked (understandably) more and more desolate as he saw what was happening. But then there is the good. The sinking. Absolutely incredible. I am always fascinated by the fact that the ship started to sink but, as is the nature of such events, everything looks normal for a while. People moved around as usual, the ship just kept motoring along. And yet we knew it would be under water in a couple of hours. The gradual submersion is enthralling, and technically brilliant. This is why I like to come back to the film, and no it's not because I'm a disaster fan (which I am) who just wants to see people die and not care about things like romance. Not at all. Really, no. A key to such films is depth of character and their relationships with each other. No real people means no emotional charge when said disaster happens. The effects are breathtaking, and the model work stunning. I can't enthuse enough about this part of the film.But the bad comes close to killing it all, and my view does not change after each time I see it. ""Titanic"" polarises me like no other film I've ever seen. It is awful. It is tremendous. Ultimately, the mixture makes it a middling film at best, which is a great shame. How it won Best Picture at the Oscars remains one of the biggest jokes in cinema history. But maybe, if we can forget about the bad, we can revel in the good, and appreciate some of the most stunning moments ever filmed in Hollywood.",Titanic
902,Mizz-Helena,Fantastic and excellent movie oded to the huge disaster..,10,11 December 2007,"I've have seen Titanic many times, and it is one of my favorite movies.

Amazingly directed by James Cameron, who must be the greatest director out there next to Peter Jackson.Now it is 10th anniversary since it has been released in 1998 in February. But it still looks like it has been made like yesterday to me, because of the amazing directing and the picture. I don't think anyone could make a great performance than Leonardo and Kate. They were the best couple ever.The real story didn't include Rose and Jack, but it was great idea to make a great story before the sinking, and it was the sadest love story also. When Rose just found the greatest love of her life, she loosed him when the ship was sinking. Think about the great time they could have if both of them survived Titanic. And it was weird when the old Rose didn't tell anyone about Jack after 80 years. I wonder who she went to when the survivors came to land in New York. We know she didn't went to her fiancé, Cal. Did she really went to her weird mum? Did she go back to her dad? thats a mystery.i would love anyway to go to a Titanic museum. I find the sinking story very touching and sad.

903,theauntsavant,Titanic Even More Impactful as 3D Re-release on Centennial,7,12 September 2012,"The 3D re-release of James Cameron's 1997 big screen epic based on the R.M.S Titanic's 1912 sinking, starring a young Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet—to-date, has received the most acclaim of any of the other nearly 30 film, documentary and made-for-television productions. His initial 2D version of the modern classic Titanic saga snagged a record 11 of its 14 Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director for Cameron, whose cinematic achievement ignited renewed interest in the most infamous maritime disaster in history for another generation of ardent viewers. The very fact that the strategic timing of the digitally enhanced movie coincided with the 15th anniversary of the original picture and the 100th year commemoration of the incident that occurred at approximately 2:20 am on April 15, 1912, set the stage for local and international observances. Reports cited 25 million people visited centennial exhibits worldwide. Although the exact numbers are slightly skewed, over 1500 of the more than 2,200 passengers and crew on board were tragically lost at sea after the luxury ocean liner struck an iceberg in the icy waters of the North Atlantic. Billed at the time as ""unsinkable,"" the ship, built at a cost of $7,500, 000 was bound for New York harbor when it sank on its maiden voyage from England, four days into the estimated 137-hour trip. The sinking garnered huge headlines around the world largely due to widely publicized advance launch announcements by the White Star Line.Numerous depictions of the colossal tragedy quickly followed with two produced the same year. The first completed just 29 days later: Saved from the Titanic, was written by a survivor who also starred in the silent film destroyed in a studio fire. Similar titled features included a 1943 Titanic that emphasized the president of White Star urging the ship's captain 'to make the fastest possible crossing to NY,' a second in 1953 and A Night to Remember in 1958, which depicted the facts from the standpoint of the most senior officer to survive the ill-fated shipwreck. The addition of special effects to the heart-tugging, romantic blockbuster delivered even more impact to put you right there amid the action and drama. While it may not have been as effective in early scenes, it improved the quality of the sequences leading up to the fateful night. Given the new discoveries, as well as discrepancies uncovered in ""Titanic: The Final Word with James Cameron"" during the 30 plus dives he's made to the wreckage since serving as screenwriter, producer and editor of Titanic, this upgrade didn't lengthen the minute runtime—much.",Titanic
904,achsaphillippi8,"Most Overrated Movie of All Time, as well as the Biggest Waste of Time",1,26 March 2012,"To this day, I have been unable to figure out why people like this movie so much. It infuriates me how people are seduced by big-budget special effects and cheesy romance, and how they can't see past the eye candy to see that this movie had almost no true substance. James Cameron's good movies are The Terminator, Terminator 2, Aliens, and The Abyss. Titanic is not included in the list.The one good thing I will say about the movie is the special effects. The big turning machinery in the bottom of the ship, and the ship sinking and people falling all over the place was fun to watch, but got old very fast. Basically, the special effects were the only thing that made the movie. Another positive thing that I have to say about the movie is that Leonardo Dicaprio was the only character in the movie that I liked.Now on to the negatives of this movie, and bear with me because there are A LOT of them.I will start with the Romance. The romance aspect of the movie is probably what most people like about this movie, but believe me when I say it is one of the corniest, shallowest love stories I have ever suffered through (although it is not nearly as bad as Twilight). Jack, or Leonardo Dicaprio, is completely infatuated with Rose, or Kate Winslet. I mean, I can tell that she is pretty, but come on dude, you couldn't have picked a more selfish, emotionally imbalanced girl.Which brings me to the thing I probably will rave about the most: Kate Winslet's character Rose. I hated her. ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY HATED HER. She is a selfish, spoiled little brat, who in the beginning of the movie, decides to jump off the ship to kill herself simply because things are not going her way. As soon as she is out on the ledge outside the railing of the ship where she can't get back by herself (especially since she was smart enough to wear high-heels), she decides that she is too scared to go through with it, and has to have Jack save her sorry butt. So after a while, the movie drags on, and finally Jack declares his love for her. And all she does in response is that she tells him that she ""has to go, now."" Are you kidding me? If an amazingly cute boy declared his love for me, I'd at least thank him for his compliments! A lot later, Rose finally decides to fall in love with him, too. Alright, okay. But what about her fruitcake of a fiancée (who looked like he was wearing eye-liner)? Well, something else happens that infuriated me. The fiancée tries to make it look like Jack stole a diamond. This is at the point where Rose pretty much loves Jack, and trusts him with her life; so why didn't she defend him when the fiancée says he stole the diamond, and Jack asserts that he didn't do it, and brings up the fact that Rose knew him well enough to know that he didn't steal it? I don't know. She is an all-around moronic little skank. Also, I got irritated when she asks Jack to draw her naked. They've known each other for... two days? And she is already offering herself to him?! What is wrong with her??!! She was only seventeen!!! Ugh, the movie drags on and on and I get more and more annoyed until the end, (SPOLIER) when Jack dies (END OF SPOILER). It was horrifyingly disappointing to see the only good character in the movie die, and the most infuriating character live to tell the stupid tale! All in all, I would have given the movie two more stars if Rose had died, preferably by falling off the ship and into the propeller.All the other characters, except for Jack, I hated, though not as much as I hated Rose. Her mother was a straight-up b-word. Her fiancée was a total fruitcake, and a mean fruitcake at that. Every other background character was flat, and unmemorable. The acting was so cheap, and I really couldn't feel any sympathy for any of the characters, even when they drowned and froze to death, which is indeed terrible, but I don't care. When I don't like the characters or the movie in general, I always wish for the movie to end with all of them dying.Besides being an overblown Hollywood special effects showcase, some smaller details of the movie seemed a little far-fetched. First of all, The elderly woman in the beginning was there at the Titanic when she was 17. That was in 1912. It is now 1997 in the movie. That would make her 102 years old. One hundred and two, and still living on her own and taking care of herself? Is that even possible? Also, how did the drawing of her naked survive all those years underwater? One last thing: the treasure hunters in the beginning of this three-hour movie ask the old lady where the Diamond is, and she tells this long stupid story, only to pull out the necklace from her drawer at the end of the movie. Why didn't the stupid hag give it to them in the very beginning?? What was the point of that three-hour, cheesy, infuriating, boring, stupid story??!!When I heard this movie was being re-released in 3D, I felt the rage at this movie coming up again.

This is mostly because I'm older and more mature; I found that I could read the characters' emotions better, and guess what they were thinking and feeling, even when they didn't say it or show it in an obvious way. I have to also give the actors credit for performances that gave me subtext to read.In a movie, acting choices are filtered through the director and editor, and I liked what they chose. It would have been so easy to show characters strutting around in fine clothes, or running wildly around in life-jackets, but the film goes beyond that. For example, one strutting gentleman provides third-class passenger Jack with a convenient model of how to carry himself like a gentleman. Some of the most poignant shots in the chaos of the sinking ship focus on crying children. Many of these shots are only seconds long, but carry an enormous weight of emotion and story-telling.I generally prefer linear stories without distracting literary devices like ""stories within stories."" (""The Notebook""'s use of this device was almost too much.) ""Titanic"" is an exception. Its clever integration of a modern-day story with the main story of the Titanic's sinking impresses on us that *this really happened.* In the opening scenes, the modern story smoothly feeds us the necessary technical and historical data to give us a context into which we can place the drama that follows. As the movie ends, two stories blend together; the modern story is really a continuation of Rose's story that begins when she boards Titanic.Another common device in movies (although this one is born out of necessity) is to have the same character, at different ages, played by different actors. In many instances, I'm not convinced that these two very different-looking people could be the same person. Titanic's Rose (at age 17 and age 101) is utterly convincing. In a modern, big-budget movie (in case you were sleeping in 1997, Titanic was, at that time, the most expensive movie ever made) I take for granted that the hair and make-up will be styled to emphasize the similarities between the two actors. As far as casting look-alikes, that also shouldn't be too hard, considering all the aspiring actors there are out there. Where this movie really goes the extra mile is in the acting. Old and young Rose share so many facial expressions, vocal inflections, gestures and movements that I never once thought of them as different people.With all these fine actors, and the obvious ability to capture stellar moments, I'm surprised at how much screen time director James Cameron allows for shots of inanimate objects. As the Titanic's front end begins to sink in earnest, tilting the ship up on end, there is a famous shot of dinner plates falling off a shelf and smashing on the floor. This shot is famous because people (like me) who were obsessed with the movie when it came out know that these plates were exact replicas of the plates on the actual Titanic, made by the same company that supplied the Ship of Dreams with its tableware. I admit that one could hardly make a movie set aboard the sinking Titanic without somehow showing the ships dramatic death throes, but there were just a few too many shots of furniture floating around, or wood splintering that distracted me from the incredibly intense *human* story being played out.""Titanic"" may not be a perfect film, but it certainly was a....um....watershed. ""Jurassic Park"" showed the world that computer animation could do amazing things. ""Titanic"" quietly and (for that time period) innocuously used this tool to create shots on a scale as grand as the ship had been. Cameron pulled out all the stops when it came to getting the details right. While the average film viewer might not have noticed this, had it not been so hyped, it impressed people on an intellectual level and helped set standards of realism and integrity in Hollywood. ""Titanic"" won 11 Academy Awards, and it deserved every one of them.",Titanic
906,gsceldridge,Beautiful film let down by a god-awful plot,1,6 October 2012,"I have given this film 1 because, for its time, the special-effects were truly excellent, and also because the costumes were and still are breath-takingly beautiful. I watched this film back-to-back as a teenager out of adoration for Leo, and now I am an adult I went to watch it again in 3D, expecting to be wowed like before. Oh dear. Themes of the film - ""Rich people are evil, all of them. Only poor people have feelings."" ""Cheating on your fiancé is fine, and he is not allowed to have any kind of reaction to this."" ""If we don't both fit on this wardrobe door, one of us will surely die...but let's only half-heartedly try once to fit us both...""Also, Kate Winslet is supposed to be 18!? REALLY!?!?!?!

907,titanrd1,Utterly Perfect,10,13 November 2005,"Why do I love this movie? ...where to begin?? To start out with, I'm a male and couldn't care less for DiCaprio. I went to see the film because I thought the sinking scenes looked cool. I still remember sitting in the theater watching the opening scenes and wondering what the hell I was watching. It wasn't what I expected. I sat watching with slight interest, a beautiful love story but I was always anticipating the iceberg's appearance. By the time the ship did begin sinking the love story had worked it's magic, I cared for Rose and Jack, I cared for the passengers and crew and Somehow I found myself hoping against logic that the ship wouldn't sink. When Jack died and Rose begins ""1500 people went into the sea..."" I was crying harder than I'd ever cried and I've never cried at a film before or since. It just hit me like a ton of bricks that 1500 people died the same way jack did, and while jack may have never existed, those other 1500 did. Some people bash this film for the love story, but it helps the audience relate on an emotional level and offers an unforgettable experience if you open your heart to it. For the last 15 minutes or so I kept hoping it wouldn't end because I doubted any ending would be satisfactory. I was pleasantly surprised though for I consider the final scene in this film to be one of the most satisfying cinematic endings ever. When the lights came on I looked around and I can honestly say that I wasn't the only person sobbing - not by a long shot. I left the theater (at nearly midnight not the least bit tired) feeling like I had just seen the best film ever made and that I would never again see something like it. Thus far, I stand by that. I tend to find that a lot of people who don't like it, did not see it at the theater and I'm not surprised. It doesn't pack the same punch in a lit room, full of distractions and on a smaller screen. To add to that, these first time watchers are expecting to find out what all the hype was about. Bits and pieces shine through on television but the full experience is in a dark theater. Now-a-days it's cool to bash this movie. As with anything popular, there's always a backlash (look at the macarena if you want proof). This is the most successful film of all time. It is absolutely amazing how far this film reached, transcending all demographics. It was a phenomenon still unequaled and i look forward to watching it age, for it is truly a timeless classic. I doubt any of this changed anybody's opinion at all, but I hope it shed some light on mine.",Titanic

909,sundaresh-a,Water water everywhere ....,2,5 December 2020,"There is a lot of intrigue surrounding this incident and a lot of enigma behind this ship. As to whether there indeed was a sinister and cruel conspiracy and a plot hatched to scuttle and to sink this vessel, along with the hopes and the dreams of its crew and its passengers on its maiden voyage to the promised land or the new world or the land of liberty as it was then called, I can only conjecture but all pointers and indicators would seem to suggest so, although I am in no position to say with any degree of certainty. Everyone of its survivors claims or rather claimed an explosion. And the ship snapped in two right down its middle which would suggest that is where the explosion occurred, in the exact mid section, where the engine room and the boilers were probably located. So clearly it could have been prearranged sabotage. Even a head-on collision of a much larger and a much faster vessel with a much larger iceberg will not create an explosive sound. It will result only in a thud and possibly the sound of ice tearing through the metal. Unless a piece of floating ice is incredibly large even a small amount of force would be sufficient to push it and nudge it away from the ships path . It does not take too much force at all to twirl ice cubes in a glass of water. So this lie and this myth about the sinking of the titanic is certainly greater than both the titanic and the iceberg. This could indeed be the first ocean-liner version of the Trojan horse, a massive floating death trap which would turn into a mammoth underwater coffin.As to this setting serving as the basis and the backdrop of a human drama and a tale of what seems like unrequited love with it's own intrigue is just as if not even more tragic, and just as heart-exploding, heart-rending,heart-wrenching , heart breaking, heart sinking and heart drowning as the scenes of the ship-exploding, ship-rending, ship-wrenching , ship-breaking , ship-sinking and the ship-drowning are.",Titanic
910,WinstonNoCGI,Marvellous Movie - Excellent 3D Conversion,10,2 May 2012,"I just went into the movie theatre to see my all time favourite movie, Titanic by James Cameron, in all its brilliance.It's just like those 15 years have never happened. It's so utterly sweeping to watch this huge vessel rising up in the screen. Cameron outstandingly managed to shoot his sequences comparing sizes against each other which - by their contrast - brings so much emotion to something we only perceive in real life: size.After watching the movie, I can't believe this is a 2D to 3D conversion. This is not just a diorama kind of 3D conversion; watching the movie it's hard to believe it was not shot in 3D originally. Even in real life action scenes Cameron stems the task of creating realistic 3D perspective throughout the movie. It must have been hell to mesh all the fringes in each and every of the frames. Well, as I learned now, it took 60 weeks and 18 Million dollars to work on this. That gamble payed off very well.Not to mention all the emotion that comes with the story. Cameron is a wizard of timing. One moment the audience is just deeply moved by romance, when it gets torn out right the next moment by fear, anger or laugh.This is a very emotional film. There are so many different fates one can as easily think his/her way into. In 1997 I have been crying about what I saw in a movie - I was baffled, because this happened for the first time in my life... Now in 2012 I was crying, laughing, fearing so much all the way again, together with my girl friend.We personally feel so much like Rose and Jack. There are so many details in the movie that match our situation, up to tiny things like dancing barefoot or the butterfly as a symbol for freedom at heart and escape from family's restrictions.To all those who don't like the movie, here's my advice: NEVER watch this film on TV! You can only appreciate this precious work of art in a movie theatre. - I never saw this movie on TV and I never will. But when it'll come back to the theatre's in a couple of years, I'll be right back to watch it there.",Titanic

The true story was infinitely more interesting than that portrayed in the film, and included in the actual account were love stories worth telling. There was no need to invent anything, much less one in which the couple make love in the back seat of a car. The scene in which the hero is chained to a pipe, freed by a single axe blow, and then swims through the frigid water was preposterous.

How should a person spend his or her life, no matter how short or long, this may be the main theme that the film director is always thinking about. It is not difficult to see that the hidden clue running through the back is the discussion on the value of life and the meditation on the way to choose life.",Titanic
919,raimi3,"James Cameron's ""Titanic""",9,27 November 2005,"I have waited several years to attempt to review this film for several reasons. I wanted to have my thoughts completely in order. I didn't want to join either side of the debate here. One side feels as though this film is the greatest of all time, the other comes with a force of backlash the size of the tidal wave in ""The Abyss."" Well now, nearly a decade later, I write my thoughts. I, like many males my age, am a huge James Cameron fan. I absolutely love Aliens, The Abyss, and the Terminator films. I feel as though he has an amazing eye for how the action in the scene needs to be conveyed on the screen. He has a very unique and complete imagination. And an unbelievable work ethic to boot. Nothing, in regards to these points, changes in Titanic. He is on his game. And he deserved everything he got back. This film is truly one of the greatest risks in all of film. Just take The Postman for example. The Postman was released this same year and went down in history as one of the biggest box office flops of all time and is regarded by a harsh majority as one of the worst movies of all time as well. Yet Kevin Costner worked hard and a lot of money was spent in order to create the film. So why did Cameron's film fare so much better?James Cameron involved more viewers with this source material than his other projects had. He still integrated amazing visuals and top notch effects into his film to please the male 18 to 30 crowd, yet the inclusion of a grand and harrowing love story caught the interest of female and older viewers as well. This is not a sell out. If you listen to James Cameron speak about this film, his interest was completely emotional from the beginning. I can't imagine how he must've felt observing the remains of the great ship laying silently at the bottom of the sea, knowing how many died and how many lives were changed when it sank. I feel as though he achieved his ultimate goal when he made Titanic. The action scenes here were a necessary tool in order to tell his human story to maximum effect, not the human story being necessary in order to tell his action story as is usually the case with his films. I feel as though he did a very good job with this change.As for any clichés. Honestly, I don't see any. There of course is the usual story devices used to get characters into conflict, but let's be honest people, this film has no more a Hollywood cliché as say a movie like...Good Will Hunting. So let's put that backlash theory to rest. Also, I've heard quite a bit of talk about historical inaccuracies in this film. I'm sure that there are quite a few, so I won't even attempt to argue. I will however point out that other historic epics have made great films with this same problem, and haven't seen nearly half the backlash that Titanic did. Take Gladiator, Braveheart, or even a more intimate movie like Cinderella Man. All great, all historical, all inaccurate. So who really cares. Is it a well made movie? That's all that really matters. Titanic is a well made movie.Titanic is by no means perfect. It is not the greatest film of all time in my opinion. But no one can argue that this film will go down in history as a great achievement. A very rare diamond in the rough that achieves box office glory, critic applause, and a large trophy cabinet. For new viewers of this film, watch only on the merits that are presented to you on the screen. Forget what the pro and con people have to say, forget how much it made, how many awards it won, and how historically accurate it is. Just let it in. My guess is that you will enjoy yourself. Afterall, this is nearly required viewing anyway. P.S. After almost ten years, I still feel as though the music in this movie is as good as it can get. James Horner does an amazing job creating a timeless back drop of music that will help carry this film through the ages.9/10",Titanic

The film can be viewed on three different levels.  There is the the (commercial) love story and the (formula) epic disaster.  Most viewers tend to deal with Cameron's masterwork from these perspectives.  But, there is a third, deeper level that is actually responsible for the film's wide appeal (it is a cynical myth that Titanic communicates only to teenage girls).

In my opinion Kate Winslet was far from her best when it came to acting in this movie. She said Jack's name ( Leonardo Dicaprio) way to much like everyone watching would forget it or something it was really annoying. I also found later on when there running from that guy who was like Billy Zanes Characters assistant or w.e and after they loose him later on they go back up and he plants the heart of the sea diamond on Jack and the fact Rose believed he stole it after willing to leave her life for him just really bother me because if it was true love she would of trusted her so called love of her life!! That made me real annoyed also. Then when the ship is sinking and she finds out its a lie and goes after him, Rose and Jack go all the way back up from the basement of the ship and find a life boat but they wouldn't let Jack on and he tells her he will find away which he probably would since his character is pretty savvy but instead she jumps back on to the sinking boat, Like what the heck! Now that made me mad...Finally the last thing that no movie has made me feel such anger and disgust was the scene when there in the water and Rose is on that door and poor Jack is in the water shivery his butt off after all he did for her and instead of switching or taking turns she just hogs the whole door till he's dead. She's all sad about his death and talks about how much she loved him but in my opinion she's the reason he died! Overall it wasn't a bad movie and if it wasn't for Kate Winslet's acting in this movie I would also agree it deserved an Oscar. I just think she was a huge flaw to the film and I also think James Cameron could of found a way better actress to play Rose because in my opinion Kate Winslet ruined this movie for me.",Titanic

""Titanic"" has great special effects but the story itself is very predictible and the characters are very vague and undefined and they don't develop at all during the film.

We of course all have heard the story of the Grand Ship that was at the time the Technological marvel of it's day. It's tragic sinking at the hands of an Iceberg in the North Atlantic was a huge blow to Man's quest to conquer nature. Cameron could have easily written a cheesy screenplay and turned it into a 70's Disaster movie, but he has created characters you care about. I've always found that films that have a huge box-office are easy targets for people to criticize, in general most blockbusters don't garner the acclaim that Titanic did. The Box office in America and around the World was unlike any before it, and I suspect it will be a long while before a film will come along to achieve what it has.

It was a profoundly impressive film, but only in certain respects. The plot was thin and predictable (well, I suppose in a film named 'Titanic', the plot pretty well *has* to be predictable), and the acting was fairly mediocre. I guess what I found so impressive was just the overwhelmingly good job that was done on making you feel like you were right there. Everything from the simulated aerial shots of the ship at the beginning of the film, right through to the close ups of events during the disaster itself is done so well that you can immerse yourself (if you'll pardon the joke) in the experience.It is just a pity that the acting from most of the performers didn't rise to the occasion. It is easy to see why none of the film's 11 Oscars was for acting. I suppose I'm a bit biased because I personally cannot stand DiCaprio, who can't act to save his soul, but I found the other performances to be less than the film really needed.Overall, though, the impressive technical achievement in bringing Titanic to the screen outweighs the human shortcomings, giving the film a rating of 7/10.",Titanic

The scenes of all those people running and screaming extending their lives by mere minutes by going to the highest part of the ship rather than giving in to their destiny really exemplifies the instinct of survival for as long as possible.  It was a very educational movie for young people who did not learn of the tragedy yet and was also a marvelous film for people who knew about the Titanic already.  You could really put yourself in their shoes and feel what it would have been like. It makes you ask yourself many important questions including: 1.  Why must we segregate people according to class, etc.? 2.  If you were a man, could you have behaved like a ""gentleman"" and stayed behind? 3  If you were a wife, could you have left your husband on that ship and gotten into the life boat without him? 4.  If you were in a lifeboat and people were screaming for you to help, could you have just rowed away to protect yourself? 5.

Also, the Gallagher character and his stooge were too predictable in their badness. Nevertheless, Titanic delivers a visual and conceptual whallop that lingers on in the memory and imagination.",Titanic
934,Eddie C.,"Terrific film, with an underrated screenplay.",10,2 January 1999,"I read ""A Night To Remember"" when I was in high school,and remember seeing the 1953 film on television (it looks hokie today  but it seemed gripping when I first saw it) so I looked forward eagerly to seeing James Cameron's movie--especially when early reviews suggested it was pretty good. I expected to see a meticulous depiction of the ship itself as well as a harrowing re-enactment of the sinking. What I did not expect was to be as moved by the human story. Several people have asked why Cameron felt he had to include a fictional love story in a story about a real-life tragedy. First, the Jack-Rose love story gave the moviegoer a chance to see most of this great ship while exploring the different worlds of first-class and steerage. Secondly, and most important of all, Cameron felt that if he made you care about the fate of two fictional people,it would make the fate of the 1500 real people who died on the Titanic seem more tangible and concrete.I can understand if a lot of people resent Leonardo DiCaprio. (In my opinion, he got too much of the credit that should have gone to Kate Winslet.) But I don't understand why people think this movie is badly written. Some of the lines do have a contemporary ring to them, but the characters are vividly drawn, and the screenplay is much better than is given credit. A beautiful example of good writing by Cameron occurs in the scene where Rose almost jumps off the stern of the ship. Jack tells Rose what it feels like to fall through thin ice and get immersed in freezing water. Not only does this serve the practical purpose of getting Rose to want to come back aboard the ship, it prepares the audience for what Titanic's victims will feel when the ship sinks. Other versions of this tragedy watch the ship from a distance and makes the audience feel they are safe in the lifeboats. In contrast, James Cameron makes the audience identify with the unlucky ones left on the ship and dying in the water. And as in Seven Samurai, because the audience recognizes and comes to know several of the passengers and crew, their deaths have all the greater impact when the ship finally sinks.",Titanic
935,Eddie C.,"Congratulations, Titanic bashers!",10,21 March 1999,"You managed to push this film off the IMDb top #250 list and push its rating down to 7.5. Now I would not say this is the greatest film ever made (that honor should go to ""Seven Samurai"" or even the best American film ever made (that honor should go to ""Casablanca""), but you can't tell me that there are more than 250 films better than this one. Certainly not ""The Three Colours"" trilogy, the most overrated set of foreign films to come out in recent years!I just have one request for the more than 18,000 people who felt compelled to vote for this movie--please rent ""The Quiet Man.""! Only 900 people have bothered to vote for this masterpiece which is far greater than ""Titanic""--and I'm a ""Titanic"" fan! If nearly 20,000 watch this film and vote their honest opinion, there is no doubt that ""The Quiet Man"" would vault to the top 10 in the top #250 list. Thank you very much.",Titanic
936,ecomcon-2,"Stop it, just stop it, or I'll scream!",6,14 June 1999,"Has the world gone utterly mad? ""Titanic"" is the best/greatest/most wonderfullest movie of all time? Nooooooooooo!Come on, people, let's get a few things straight.First the good news: (1) ""Titanic"" had lovely (and seemingly accurate) costuming, (2) beautiful sets, (3) first-rate special effects (okay, let's call the F/X spectacular), and (4) a gorgeous musical score. Overall, I was so touched at the end of the movie that my eyes were filled with tears (for some strange reason my wife finds my sentimentality amusing).Now the bad news: (1) the scripting was awful (some of the dialogue that came out of the characters' mouths made me winch with pain), (2) the characterizations were weak and predictable (there was no doubt as to who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. All the good guys were totally good, all the bad guys were totally bad. If you ever want to see a person who has both good AND evil qualities all you need to do is look in the mirror: it's called human nature), (3) some scenes can only be described as vulgar Disneyesque (who can forget that romantic ""I'll jump your bones you in the back of the car number?"" Oh, and let's not forget the hand running down the window, now that was touching), (4) blame the script all you want, but the acting was weak, and finally, (5) one of the worst scenes in a motion picture: the infamous ""I'll teach you how to spit"" scene. That was in such bad taste. With the possible exception of really uncouth adolescents, who could watch that scene and not be repelled?Okay, now that I've gotten that off my chest I feel so much better.To conclude, no, ""Titanic"" was NOT the best movie of all time, nor was it the worst. It's a must-see movie, no doubt about it. It is a great movie if you like black-and-white characters with a color-by-numbers story line. Unfortunately if you demand complex characters, solid acting, and credible plots you will be sorely disappointed.",Titanic
937,bahai62,A striking piece of romance,10,18 February 2000,"I was impressed very much by this movie, not for its pictures or its director's talents, but I liked it just for the sake of the extraordinary romance happening between well chosen Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet.

938,Walter Gamble,a little too much made over a little too little,7,5 November 2000,"I enjoyed Titanic a hell of alot, it had enormous and terrific production design, wonderful acting, a beautiful score and well just alot of fun. Did I think it was the best film of the year?, do I think it is any competition for such movie classics as Good Will Hunting, As Good As It Gets or L.A. Confidential?, do I think this deserved to topple Jurassic Park out as the highest grossing film of all time?. NO, NO and NO. What is just 3 hours of good entertainment has gotten blown way out of proportion, I enjoyed this film in the same way and as much as other Cameron hits and I'm sure no-one is going to give True Lies or The Terminator best picture. I suggest those 2 or 3 people in the world who haven't seen Titanic do so, but just not to expect a piece of film history.",Titanic

For what it's worth, it's decent entertainment, moves along at a fairly good pace - impressive, considering this is a three hour flick - and Kate and Leo were okay (though both can do much better). I expected worse, knowing it had been horribly over-hyped and that James Cameron was evil (one can argue about how evil). Also, the sets and Kate's dresses were very pretty. That's about it for the positives. The story is shallow and full of holes, most of the dialog is plain silly, and the whole movie is, basically, spectacular kitsch. I honestly think Titanic is probably one of the least deserving Academy Award winners ever - and in the same year as LA Confidential, Good Will Hunting, and even The Full Monty.

To me, this movie is pure eye-candy.  It's beautiful, simply amazing to look at, and if you're deaf--it might be a good film.  Everyone in the cast is a fantastic actor/actress.  But Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet turn in the WORST performances of their careers.  I watched them in embarassment. A bad car accident on film (actually a boat disaster).That's not to say the film lacks any emotion.  I felt for everyone on the ship except Jack and Rose.  What really makes my stomach turn is the entire cast and crew not minding that this is a fictional story set in historic facts.  It's rearranging history and I do hope future generations don't see it this way.  If you liked Disney's Pocahontas or any other film playing off historic events, then you might enjoy this.  I'm not saying this couldn't have happened, but I would have preferred that they would have said up front, on the cover or box or poster that this movie is 95% fiction: Yes there was a boat named Titanic, and it did in fact sink.I wonder if the survivors thought the movie was good or accurate (or if any of  them saw it at all).  Were their feelings hurt that such a horrific event was made into a blockbuster love-story film and capitalized on relentlessly?  I honestly cringe thinking about the future real-life disaster films--will 9/11 be turned into a love story?  Maybe...only when we're dead or too old to even see it.Hollywood, start writing original material.  No remakes, no copying, no historical 'what if' scenarios, and no predictable endings.

941,zorn24601,Titanically overrated,6,18 June 2002,"Teenage girls spent an entire summer watching this movie; people flocked to it in unprecedented numbers; the Academy of Motion Pictures completely lost its head and awarded it Best Picture. All for a film that was little more than a poorly-written Harlequin Romance set on the greatest ship to never finish one voyage.This film could have been improved in so many ways:1) Punt the insipid fictional love story and focus on the real-life characters. The supporting cast playing the actual people on board the Titanic was, on the whole, a much better group of actors than the ones in the fictional love story. 2) Have somebody (anybody!) else play the role of Jack. Matt Damon would have been good, Joaquin Phoenix would have been better, but DiCaprio was a huge mistake.3) If DiCaprio is really a must, have him and Billy Zane switch roles. Zane is much better suited to the romantic lead role, and DiCaprio would have been perfect as an unlikeable, self-absorbed fop.4) The Captain should have been portrayed more as he was in real life, not as the confused, incompetent geezer the movie makes him out to be. Witness reports say that Captain Smith acted heroically and with honor; it is a disservice to his memory to portray him as this film does.After all this, I must admit that I did kind of like this movie. I just don't understand all the fuss over it, and I REALLY don't understand why it won the Best Picture Oscar. This is a good film, but it is far from being a great film.",Titanic

There is nothing new to the moviegoer: Here we have a disaster happening. Almost everybody will die at the end of the movie - and hey, we know all about it even before going to the movie.

943,AshCaton,Ordinary,6,27 March 2009,"This is not a groundbreaking film. This is not even an informative film. Instead it is an ordinary, clichéd, love story set on a boat. It looks gorgeous, it's very well acted, it's only failing is in it's false premise. This is not a film about the Titanic. This I found incredibly irritating as I was desperate for more focus on what was going on anywhere else but with Jack and Rose. What is most ridiculous is that the film even makes point of introducing the Captain and other historically accurate characters, only to ignore them until the climax. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are both very capable actors and I think they tackle Rose and Jack admirably, in other hands they could have been very cringe-worthy indeed. For me, the most interesting part of this film is Bill Paxton and his mates going to examine the ship in present day. The rest of the story descends into a bloated, overly sentimental blur of over dramatic emotions as Billy Zane suddenly goes loony and Celine Dion's heart goes on and on and on... Literary critics said in 1912 that it took a vast amount of human vanity to create the Titanic, and now it took another huge dollop to make this movie. I didn't cry. Neither will you.",Titanic

945,richardclarke13,A film that never fails to tell a difficult story in an interesting and tragic way,10,29 January 2006,"The critics had the knives out for James Cameron's masterpiece long before its release. They were going to criticise its for being too long, too boring, badly acted, Badly directed etc. But when Cameron released this film (about a subject that has been a lifelong fascination of mine and his) the critics were silenced and the film did all the talking.And boy did it talk! It become the first film in history to make 1 billion dollars and no other film has quite caught the publics imagination like it. It tells a simple story set against the backdrop of the biggest maritime disaster yet. Rose Dewitt Bukater (kate winslet) is unhappily boarding the titanic with her overtly snobby partner Cal (Billy Zane) and her family and while attempting suicide meets Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and straightaway falls in love with him as though he is from a different class he shows her a different more enjoyable life than the one she is having with Cal.Titanic shows you triumph over disaster in all its shapes and forms. Titanic is also a story about the great class divide which used to exist (some people say it still does) and though you know the outcome watching this film for the 1st time or the hundredth time doesn't fail to intrigue. Although factually incorrect in parts (especially in the case of officer William Murdoch who despite his portrayal in the film as a bad guy who shot himself actually was a good guy who went down with the ship) this is the most true adaptation of this story. It won 11 Oscars in 1998 (equalling the haul of all about eve and Ben hur!) including the biggie, best picture and has won universal praise from cinema-goers but not so from some of those critics who have largely lambasted it (showing once and for all that there is a world of difference between critic and cinema goer) the acting (particularly from DiCaprio, Winslet and Zane) is exemplary and earns titanic the film as much a place in history as the event itself.

The first part of the film is unrealistic, because she would not have been so reckless with showing her love for him while being on that ship, where there is no way to escape her fiancé - she would have found a way to wait till she could escape in NY.Now, the physics - he could not have pulled her back up when she was hanging off the rail of the ship in the beginning of the ship, she would have pulled him overboard with her or, more likely, his hand would have slipped and she would have fallen.She ship in several simulations looks too small....more to add later, getting bored even writing about this.

It definitely showed the tragedy of the Titanic because the whole sinking of the Titanic in the movie was done in such detail that you really learned and could feel how tragic it was! For most men to come on here and write bad reviews about this movie, just don't, because the romance between Jack and Rose was for girls and to make the movie a romantic tragedy. Making it a romantic tragedy made the movie more sad so we could feel even more how much of a tragedy it was! Men obviously don't like romance like that, but the way the did the sinking scene was fabulous! I am a girl so I loved the romance between Jack and Rose, and I think that it truly added more to the movie, because you have to have a story line for a movie that you don't want to make a documentary. The story line was amazing because back then everything was about if you are 1st class, 2nd class, or 3rd class, and you could really see how the 3rd class people were treated compared to the 1st class people because Jack was a very, very poor 3rd class man, and Rose was a 1st class woman engaged to such a wealthy man. If you are a guy you won't really like the romance story line, but that doesn't make it a bad movie. If you are a girl I would definitely recommend watching this movie! I did cry, A LOT!

Thatis an insult, and I'm quite sure willey is rolling in his grave.Titanic only redeeming factor is timing and,our morbid pre-occupation with disasters. This story has been told in many movies,which were better directed,with much lower budgets.

950,wiseman-4,"big, expensive and banal",1,18 June 2004,"I saw 'Titanic' twice as it was released in 1997. My first impression was ""wow"", it felt really stunning and visually impressive, big and simply the ""best"". However the impression was lost soon. One thing I realized - 'good movie' is not equal to 'expensive movie'. After this I saw hundreds of films and I started to evaluate them from a different point of view and 'Titanic' sank to the ocean of Hollywood production, not leaving a footstep after it.This was a very expensive film, but as I now remember the whole story, the way it was shown, the grandiose hype of it... it feels completely banal, plain and... cheap. Cheap not in terms of money spent on it but in terms of plot, acting and general style of the movie. Yes I have to pay my respect to the director for such a grandiose work and all those Oscars he received (even though they're not that valuable anywhere but in Hollywood), but to my opinion this film is an expensive and unsuccessful attempt to make a good film. Yes, the views were nice and realistic, but that's all. There's nothing more I could rate positively in this film except the technical special effects. How many more criterion's despite special effects are there while rating a movie?I congratulate the makers of 'Titanic', they did a good business and after spending $ hundreds of millions they profited even more but that doesn't make 'Titanic' a good film. It's just another 'stunning' piece of Hollyywood production in the bad meaning of it. Sorry if I sound too harsh but I really mean it. For nice effects - 4/10",Titanic
951,dxia,What a strange world,8,14 March 2004,"'Titanic' is one of those movies that I have a strange relationship with. When it was released, no one had ever seen anything like it. I marveled at the technical brilliance, the superb attention to detail, and the incredible amount of work that went into its production. I liked the movie very much, but apparently so did many, many other people. My friends and classmates went to see the movie again and again, week after week. Children and teenagers gasped and said it was the greatest movie ever made. The infamous theme song to the movie was played everywhere, on radios, at funerals, and at every conceivable public arena. And to make it worse, it managed to sweep almost every award it was nominated for, even though it was the year of 'L.A. Confidential,' 'Gattaca,' 'As Good As It Gets,' 'Donnie Brasco,' and P.T. Anderson's superb 'Boogie Nights.' It's true that many of these movies were recognized for their achievements, but it was difficult to hear about anything that wasn't related to 'Titanic.' And I was very tired of it.I spoke out as often as possible, ridiculing people for loving the movie and for falling for its rather insipid romance story. I tried to spread it around that 'Titanic' is a movie that should be hated, not loved, for its huge production value and mainstream appeal. Unfortunately, I wasn't the only man that did this, and apparently the message has gotten around too well.It has become so popular to hate 'Titanic' that I think people are disliking it for the wrong reasons. The teenagers that once loved the movie have grown up and began joining the crowds in ridiculing it. In college, I remember wanting to review a scene in 'Titanic' to help me write a paper about the use of light shading and colors in tragedies. While I was watching the movie in the communal lounge, I received no less that a dozen scoffs and insults from passersby. The same people that once loved the movie that I had despised were now turning on me for watching it.What a strange world. The truth is that 'Titanic' is a wonderfully made movie and worthy of admiration. I reviewed the rewards that it won, and I realized that almost all of them are technical awards, which it deserves. It has been a victim of mainstream shallowness that not only clouded its original appeal but now has lost its fan base simply because it's ""uncool"" to like the movie. I am a heterosexual man, and I like 'Titanic.' But now it seems that I have to try to undo the damage that myself and other men have done to what is otherwise an excellent movie.",Titanic
952,Thomasdinnegan75,Titantic- the unsinkable movie !,9,19 June 2012,"Titanic, simply, is a masterpiece, a movie that in my lifetime, i have no doubt in saying, will never be surpassed. As soon as you hear the word ""Titanic"", in truth, you don't think of the ship, you think of the movie! sad fact but a true one none the less. Cameron, no doubt, has cemented his name in Movie history for many years to come thanks to this epic, amazing, tragic, heart felt , emotion jerking movie!I've ticked the box that states "" MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS"" but I'm sure it comes as no spoiler to anyone that in the end the ship actually sinks, and if it does, buy a brain! As we all know, the Titanic was re-released this year in 3D for its anniversary, and also money making purposes, none the less, as I watched it in the Cinema, I realized , it takes ages for the movie to get to the point, which if you've seen the movie like 100 times, makes it even more difficult to watch in an uncomfortable seat in a cinema, however, its defiantly worth the wait! The beginning was extended in the 3D version this year, I hated that, because even in the 2D version I always thought that the beginning was a bit pointless and it annoyed me, not the showing of the ocean, i love that, basically because of the superb music! Hymn To The Sea is a magnificent piece of music, that draws on every piece of emotion one has, and i just love it. However, the boat scene, where they spent like 20 minutes of the film taking rubbish at the beginning annoys me, and i felt it didn't need to be extended. I must stress although, apart from the opening scene on the boat, I find every other scene that includes the boat and an elderly Rose (Gloria Stuart), Brock (Bill Paxton) and his crew vital to the development of the story!Above all else in this movie, the acting etc, I love the plot adaption, the fact that, yes Titanic was a tragedy, and without the love story of Jack and Rose, the sinking would have still been a horrific and sad moment in the film, but the fact that Jack dies, adds to tragedy, because we followed their relationship through the whole film, just as married couples who lived together for years, were separated and thanks to the amazing love story of Jack and Rose, we as the audience, really feel the pain of everyone who lost someone on the titanic, and personally I feel that this was a genius move by Cameron, as it filled us with more emotion, which is exactly what the sinking of the titanic deserves, emotion! The acting was also good in this film, I think that Jack and Rose are just as famous as Romeo and Juliet at this stage and I think that it will remain the same for many many years, the script was brilliant, the introduction, development and ending of their relationship was superb, and the fact that it was a rich woman falling in love with a poor man even makes it more enjoyable, as she risked so much for him and sacrificed so much, that in the end, when he dies, we feel her pain. Also the scene of the old couple in bed hugging preparing to die, hits me like a ton of bricks every time, or the mother telling her kids the story of Tir na Nog, where the youth live forever,both are for me, easily the saddest scene in the movie, and probably in movie history ! because it arouses every emotion in me, it makes me feel saddened that an old couple, who spent their life together will die, yes its nice they go together and holding hands,but it is such a sad scene,and then in contrast it shows how young innocent kids died, who never got a chance to live, the fact that each scene comes after each other is clever from Cameron, as it shows us an elderly couple who lived life, too 2 kids, who never got the chance! i have to admit, i cry like a baby every time i see these scenes and hear that wonderful piece of music in the background, Hymn to the sea.Overall, it is so obvious that this film will always be a classic, the type of movie that in 20 years, us teens, will watch with our kids. Titanic is the best film ever made! that i have no doubt in saying, the acting, storyline, music, use of emotion, use of the love story between Jack and Rose and the contrasting scenes, make it an amazing, epic, every word in the dictionary for pure class movie! As I said at the beginning, the Titanic truly is the unsinkable movie.",Titanic
953,Peaceful224,I feel kind of bad for this movie....,5,9 January 2018,"It is true that this movie was over rated when it first came out. It made a billion dollars at the box office and it was on the IMDB top 250 with a rating of 9.6! It was all the rave. But the rating slowly started to sink (no pun intended) and it got low as a 6.9. The movie received extreme backlash. The past few years the rating has been increasing. Titanic has been going through what I like to call ""the rating roller coaster."" It's ratings are constantly changing since everyone has so many different opinions on this movie. I feel kinda bad for it...I understand why so many people don't like this movie. The love story really isn't anything new or different, and the main character Rose can be annoying at times. And of course, like many other people, I am really annoyed about the whole Jack could have survived thing. Like seriously, they both could have fit on the giant floating door! Rose acted like she loved Jack so much, but she barely even tried to get him to fit on the door. All she had to do was move over a little. They wouldn't have even been in the situation if Rose hadn't jumped back on the ship. She should have stayed put in that lifeboat and waited for Jack. He would have had a better chance of surviving, cause then he just has to worry about himself. I feel like their love story may have been a bit exaggerated. I mean, it's good that they wanted to be together forever, but they had only known each other for like four days! Most people don't fall in love that easily or that fast.I have only watched this movie when it comes on TV, and I haven't seen the whole thing because it's SO long. It's like 3 hours. I love the last hour of the movie, which is the boat sinking. I love how it's done and how it's handled. It fills me with suspense every time I watch it. I don't really like anything else about this movie, just the boat sinking. And no, not because people die. It's because it's so suspenseful.

Just like in Romeo and Juliet, you know what the end is going to be, and you can't help but hope the end is going to be different than you know it to be and you just can't help watching it.  Mixing the fictional story of Rose and Jack, with the true life people who really sailed on the Titanic was done quite well.  I can tell you, watching the very detailed sinking of the ship probably only gave the viewers a 20% feeling of horror that the actual passengers had, especially third class. How they put people in the ships by class really irritated me, a sad fact but true.  Putting only 12 people in a boat that could have held 60-70 when they were already short of lifeboats was incomprehensible.  It seems to me, that even after 80 years, generations of people have never gotten over the sinking of this ship, and they probably never will.

But suspense there is, not least because we don't know whether her lover will make it. There is also action, social (class) comment, drama, historical notes - not least several comments on the cause of the initial impact and why it was so disastrous - and good old fashioned romance.Rarely has a three hour film seemed so short.

The romance at the centre of the plot develops quickly and my attention was held not only by developments in this story but the events that, taken together, spelt disaster for the 'unsinkable' ship, and then the aftermath of the ship's collision with that famous iceberg.Kate Winslet was simply gorgeous and put in a fine performance, as did Leonardo di Caprio as Jack Dawson. The make-up of the older Rose (Gloria Stuart) was one of the less convincing aspects of the movie, but it seems churlish to draw attention to such a detail; in any case, it's to be expected that an 87 year old will need a fair amount of facial recontouring and war-paint to play a woman of 101.",Titanic
957,Ryuji-2,Cookie-cutter plot kills a work of art.,6,29 April 1999,"""Titanic"" has all the elements of a smashing movie.  Unusually high level of detail (comparable to ""Star Wars""), a respectful tribute to Titanic's researchers, and plenty of money.  The cast is skilled, the soundtrack beautiful, and the cinematography masterful.  Now all we need is a plot. After all, because history betrays the ending, the ship's fate alone will not draw audiences.  Something needs to turn the beautiful documentary into a gripping movie.  A love story does the job nicely; it was a good idea. But then, Cameron takes over.Good Lord, what a nauseating soap opera.  The farm-boy hero, spunky maiden and evil villain trio, all but used up in ""Star Wars"", is disgustingly uncreative.  Some of the lines (""And he saved me, in every way a woman could be saved"") are so cheesy even the masterful thespians DiCaprio, Winslet and Stuart can't save their characters from being reduced to cardboard cutouts. What was Cameron thinking??  Anyone sharp enough to appreciate the detail would vomit from the recycled storyline, and anyone naïve (or stupid) enough to fall for the fairy-tale romance wouldn't acknowledge the historical faithfulness.In any case, everybody ought to see this movie at least once; it's not bad for a brainless love story and beautifully crafted.  But if you're an educated movie connoisseur, bring a barf bag.",Titanic

Yes, the visual effects are good, but the true story behind Titanic is the astonishment and shock of the worlds most luxurious ocean liner sinking on its maiden voyage. The fact that it was labeled unsinkable, yet sank! All the unfortunate victims of its doomed first and final voyage. Not about two kids who boink in the back seat of some jalopy! It needed to show more realism, the truth, and have a much better, stronger story. The movie was simply filled with too much cheesy acting, and not enough facts. I'm not saying this cause I'm a guy, I'm saying this because it is what was evidently clear in my eyes when i saw this film, and is congenial with the eyes of many others.",Titanic

960,Jeff M.-3,One of the Best Ever,10,11 April 2001,"**Standard covering spoiler warning, just in case.** Like many other films I have seen and then read the IMDb comments for, many seem to either love it or hate it, although in this film the extremes are not as vivid.  I happen to, for this movie, fit in the former category.  I saw it five times in theaters, most with excellent theater sound and picture quality, but if you want to really see it, you have to have seen it in all its glory on an IMAX screen with the surround sound (Branson, MO, Aug. 1998).  THAT was a cinematic experience.I have been interested in the Titanic story since 1994, and I never tire of learning or talking about it.  I more or less fell over myself (and my parents) to get to it in its first ten days.  On December 27, 1997, I was not disappointed.The CG work with the ship is spectacular, especially the flyby with the water and the smoke.  That takes a lot of work, and it was pulled off nicely.  Not to be outdone by that, the CG work in the sinking phase of the movie was great too.  Give the hand to Digital Domain.  Especially that guy that hits the propeller.  Another big hand goes to the art and set departments.  Can other historical movies claim to order the same carpet and lifeboat davits as those of the original?  Lots of little things add up, although there were as many equally little things that were missed.  This movie certainly has the biggest goofs page I've seen, but more on that later.As a male, I certainly am not one of those who went to see it for Leo and/or any part of a love story.  However, it does provide an effective vehicle (however flawed you wish to claim it) for connecting the present to the past and showing all aspects of the ship.  The love story is not the central issue.  The story of the ship and the hope, glory, and tragedy in it is what you're looking for.  The story serves to get you from first class to third, from the forepeak (although passengers didn't go there) to the stern, and the boiler rooms to the bridge.  As far as DiCaprio and Winslet themselves, well, I don't have enough acting 'experience' to be declarative on that.The interplay with the historical figures is done well, for the most part. Some of us more than others may know exactly who is being discussed or referred to with their historical context, e.g. Colonel Gracie with the women he was helping when Rose and Jack come out of the Second Class stairs. Getting to know Mr. Andrews was a good thing to put in.  Of course, you have to realize that the cast of characters during the dinner scene, although all real people except for Rose, Ruth, Jack, and Cal, would most likely never have dined together.  However, it does serve the purpose of putting the fictional characters in with history.This film is not without its errors.  I mean, check out the goofs page. Many are your run-of-the-mill continuity errors, but others are legitimate factual errors that, despite the best efforts of Cameron and crew, happen. A film based on a true story with photographic and witness records, not to mention a couple volumes of Senate testimony, will do that. Those who are not at least moderate scholars won't catch most of them.Goofs particularly grating to this buff are Astor at the Grand Staircase at 2:15 (he was crushed by the funnel), Molly Brown being called Molly before the sinking, the inordinate amount of women on Collapsible A (there was one, Rosa Abbott), and the Brown/Hitchens standoff, which Brown actually won and did get the women to row.  On a side note to that, though, you will notice in Boat 6 both Frederick Fleet and only one first-class man, who was ordered into it because he was a yachtsman and they only had one seaman on board. That's a historical detail not lost on me.The soundtrack is worth every note played on it.  I think the movie as a whole earned every Oscar it got, and/but was rightfully denied the ones it did not.  The fifteen minutes that begin when the band finishes playing are, in my opinion, one of the (if not THE) best fifteen-minute sequences in movie history.  (But some may not say that doesn't mean much because there are a lot better five-minute sequences out there.  To each his or her own.) Anyone wondering why this movie didn't hit the AFI 100, by the way, it's because voting was cut off at movies made in 1996 and earlier.  Obviously a December 1997 release doesn't make the cut.If you want to see some of the more-known deleted scenes and some of the not-known deleted scenes, and would like to know more about the ship in general, I recommend James Cameron's Titanic Explorer CD.  If you are interested in the ship's story as a whole, this is a valuable addition, and movie clips interspersed throughout make it that much more real.Looking at the rankings, you can see that it's tops (10-35%), it's great or good (8/9-25%), or it's not worth the 3:10 of celluloid it's printed on (1-11%).  AS I said earlier, to each his own.  I loved it, and it earns its ten.  For the naysayers, well, I also love The Matrix, and according to some of the reviews I read I'm a mindless hack for that too.",Titanic
961,BadRon,"Jaded, All Of You! :(",10,23 June 2000,"Every time a film becomes such a huge participant of pop culture in this country, the backlash will surly soon follow. People can trash it all they want - this film was successful on all levels. AND THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS GOING TO CHANGE THAT! Cameron has smartly avoided the spotlight the last few years, not involving himself in any major feature film. Have the feeling he knows his critics can't wait to tear him down? And by the way, I agree the love story is relatively weak. But the film DOES justly honor the memories of those who died in this tragedy.

The talented cast turns in solid performances and the direction from James Cameron is top notch. I can't really say much more about this film that hasn't already been said so sit back and enjoy.",Titanic
963,Chessack,"Pathetic, high-budget, glorified version of Love Boat",1,11 October 2000,"As normal, I break with most people I know, since they generally loved this movie. I didn't like it at all, for a large number of reasons.First of all, it was too long. They showed detail in scenes that did not need detail, and even within the movie, they re-hashed scenes multiple times. In fact, it almost felt like the second half of the movie was a poorly-done sequel to the first half of the movie. In the first half, we saw way too much detail about the 'daily life' on the ship, most of which I found boring and not worthy of my time to watch.  In the second half, we saw a 90 minute pseudo-documentary of the sinking of the Titanic, an event which even in real life only took 2 hours. So basically, James Cameron showed us almost every single minute of the sinking. This is poor from a technical dramatic standpoint. Good drama glosses over the boring, nitty-gritty details, to focus on the important stuff. Cameron decided to show the nitty-gritty details with as much care and attention as the important sequences. Some interpret this as ""great attention to detail."" I don't see it that way. I see it as boring depiction of events that are neither relevant to the plot nor worthy of my time to witness.This brings us to my second complaint about this movie: the plot. Basically, this was a glorified, very expensive version of the old TV show ""The Love Boat."" Indeed, most episodes of ""Love Boat"" that I can recall were of a higher caliber, plot-wise and dialog-wise, than this movie was. I thought the dialog was forced, and stale, and did not ""ring true"" at all. Cameron was too ""present"" in the movie -- that is, I felt that he was forcing the characters to do exactly what he wanted, rather than having events take their ""natural"" course. Probably, this is because he was depicting something based in truth (the sinking of the Titanic), and so he had no choice about where the overall story would end up (the ship sinks -- I assume this is not a spoiler for anyone, heh heh). Thus, he had to force the part of the story that leads up to the sinking in a certain direction, and he did this in a poor manner that was too blatant, and made the whole thing seem artificial.I also thought both the principle actors (Kate Winslett, Leo DiCaprio) turned in terrible performances. I didn't really believe in either of them. Worse yet, they annoyed me, and their characters really irritated me. This is a terrible flaw in a disaster movie: if you dislike the characters to which the disaster (in this case, the sinking of the ship) is going to happen, then you really don't care whether they live or die. In fact, I was actually rooting for BOTH of them to die, because by the end of the film, they had irritated me enough that it was the only way I thought I'd get any satisfaction.I will admit that the film had excellent special effects. Normally, I like special effects movies. I even don't mind ones that openly, honestly have no interest in plot, characters, or story. However, Titanic had none of those things except special effects, but tried to pretend like it did. It's that presumptuousness that really irritated me. The movie so blatantly lavish, scenes were so clearly done ""just to show they could do it,"" that I could sense the arrogance of Cameron and the entire cast and crew in every scene.
This movie was a big waste of more than 3 hours of my time. My rating: 1/10.",Titanic

I don't care about the old, boring people looking for the jewels, I just want to see the boat sink, just like everyone else. It is directed very badly, and how James Cameron won best director is a mystery to me, and many other people too. Kate Winslet did a lack-luster job, and that is hard for me to say, seeing as I adore her in everything else she is in. I think that it was a bad film and that it shouldn't have won any of the awards it did, because it was not good at all. Big budget doesn't necessarily mean big hit.

I first saw this movie when I was about eleven. I watched it because I became fascinated with the titanic. That was almost four years ago. Since then I have grown from loving flashy and violent movies to more well crafted (even though sometimes still violent, like the original Star Wars of Lord of the Rings) movies. Each shot is well done. I like how anything not having to do with roses family or jacks friends actually happened. They had more that you can see in their numerous deleted scenes. All the actors were brilliant. I was surprised when I heard Kate Winslet in her British accent. The music was flawless.

The love story leading us all through it is hokey and it's far too long, but it is captivating. Winslet was decent, Leo was marginal, and Zane was way over the top - could any real person actually be that annoying? The effects were mostly good and occasionally stunning. Overall, it wasn't a bad flick. Had Cameron put half the effort into the romance story and the characters that he put into the effects it might have earned it's 11 Oscars. On the other hand, you have to hand it to him for being smart enough to know that there are millions of women out there that'll drag their boyfriends and husbands out over and over to see the charming and handsome DiCaprio drown for the love of a woman (and husbands and boyfriends that are secretly not complaining about having another look at Winslet or the cool FX).",Titanic

Never has a film inspired such emotion in me, such a feeling of belonging to the thrills and struggles of the characters on the screen. The music, a rich blend of instrumental and vocal, is far from archaic. It inspires emotional power that would have otherwise been lost. The story is obviously well-researched, the images are heartbreaking and breathtaking, and, unlike many epics, Titanic is not arrogant, and it does not drag on. In fact, despite its being one of the longest movies I have ever seen, it felt rushed. It was over too soon. It was that good. I did not even think that the love story was that distracting from the grandeur. It was just another human aspect masterfully explored by the film: greed, hate, panic, and, above all, love, a love so profound, so passionate, that it should inspire viewers with envy, not laughter. No, Titanic is as close to flawless as anything can get. With characters that should rightfully be hated and loved, characters to whom we can all relate, a recapture of the world of the past and the ship itself synonymous to a time machine, and a story replete with comedy, tragedy, and thrill, Titanic is a classic that time can never erode, and that shall always inspire laughter and tears.",Titanic

Would I have to go and see the movie at a theatre it was simply impossible. Theatres were full at each session even if the movie was on heavy rotation all over Paris (France). One day I just thought to myself that it couldn't be THAT bad if so many people after so many months were still going to watch it if not re-watch it or even re-re-re-watch it! I gave in one day and I can assure you that the theatre was still full. I must say I really liked it the first time. Like in the old times, big fat sumptuous cinema! Now having seen it several times on a format that should be excommunicated (TV), I found a lot of annoying if not irritating things in it. I still like the film globally but there are real spoilers. First once someone made you aware that some parts of the movie have been made using a computer, you can't help spotting them and thinking that navy crew in the background at the beginning of the film have a funny way of walking a bit like playdoh men. Other stuff bothered me a lot eg Rose doing a 'finger' when they take the lift to go to a lower level of the boat. Was it necessary? Is it plausible at such a time in the history? It kinda makes you think 'oh man they can't be serious!'.",Titanic
978,zdh952,"Holds up, but has problems",8,21 May 2014,"I just watched this for the first time in about 15 years last night. I saw it when it came out, and i was entirely too young to appreciate it (i was about 9 when it came out). The movie over all holds up and it good but there are few things i don't care for. Visually, even 17 years later, the movie is a masterpiece. Sets, costume, cgi, all of it is a impressive as it was when it first came out. The first half of the movie is slow and plodding, which everyone complains about, but this is a love story, not a disaster movie, so I personally think those people need to readjust their expectations and watch this again. My big problem is the 2 leads. DiCaprio and Winslet are OK. But thats honestly about it. Lines are delivered (I feel) either flatly or are over acted. I see them falling in love and honestly it doesn't grab me. And that's not because I'm a guy, I love a good romance. Something about their chemistry just doesn't seem as genuine as i was expecting. Some of the lines at the end are painfully corny, especially DiCaprio's telling Winslet that she is going to ""make lots of babies"".... Seriously? That could have been beautiful, it's the gut wrenching end to a Romeo and Juliet love story, but I feel like that whole scene was written by an 8 year old. Kathy Bates, as always, I liked, and Billy Zane gets my vote for ""Best Scumbag in a Movie Ever"". I do like that Cameron make Winslet ""Transform"" as so many of his characters do (Sarah Connor and Ripley start out powerless and end up tearing the movie apart, and in much the same way Winslet starts as a trapped helpless woman, and ends the movie by taking an ax to doors and saving the lead male). That is done VERY well. I'm still giving this 8 stars because even though this may have snags that I don/t care for, the over all story and the setting are very very strong. The pathos of the passengers drowning or trying to save their children had a knot in my stomach and most of the characters are great, even if the 2 leads are only good.",Titanic
979,BlueGreen,PAINFUL...,4,16 August 2004,"Painful is the word that comes to my mind when I think of Cameron's ""Titanic"". Why? Because such a budget, such magnificent special effects - so much of everything! - was shamelessly wasted on a fifth-rate plot that mocks the magnificent true stories of the ""Titanic"". It could have been THE film of the century; instead, it's a colossal monument to Hollywood's dementia.Someone on this forum asked how could anyone hate this film. All those who have read the true accounts of what happened on the ""Titanic"" cannot BUT hate it. The sinking ""Titanic"" provided a stage for acts of incredible heroism (and cowardice); it became the catalyst and a showcase for all the highs and lows of human nature. An example for those who absolutely need a love story: there were 9 newly wed couples aboard the ship; only four or five of the new husbands survived. Why not base the main story line on one or two of those true tragedies? Would they be perhaps too boring for Hollywood's target audience (whatever and wherever it is)...? I think not. But even as a work of fiction (which it is), this film leaves a lot to be desired. In real life - even in 1912 - not all the ""poor"" are a priori merry and good-natured; and not all the ""rich"" are narrow-minded and snobby, as they are portrayed in this film. As far as the characters are concerned, this is very much a black & white movie. And the dead - the REAL dead - of the ""Titanic"" are merely a backdrop for the director's see-through shallow, unimaginative ego.

He is an amazing director and writer that this movie would not have worked without him.Kate Winslet was astonishing as Rose and this movie certainly did great because of her as you couldn't picture anyone else performing this character. Leonardo DiCaprio was also truly good as 'Jack'. He should have got the Oscar nomination for this character. Their connection appeared to contain all the features that every Hollywood romantic movie has. The two teenage lovers are breaching the social rules to be considering each other.

It truly mentally hurts me when I don't see this movie in top 200 in IMDb's list. It upsets me when people say that they didn't like the movie. It might not be a stunning success but it really was a good cinematic success. Cameron did reveal way too much of enthusiasm to presume what the people on the ship resembled. But it was in fact after the collision that the movie finally got interesting. This is the ingredient of the story which the director wanted to convey.

Amazing set pieces and camera-work which genuinely immerse you and take you to another time and place, top notch special effects, a brilliant cast,and to me to this day, a still very important reflection on our priorities in life; decency vs ""winning one way or the other"", appeasing and preserving privilege or freeing yourself from a golden cage, security or real love without any material guarantees. And for the love of god, Jack died in the water, let's save DiCaprio and ourselves from actual flooding! And no I don't agree, saving our planet isn't a political statement, it's absolute insanity to not see that as at least ""kinda important"". So I am not going into any arguments about technical inaccuracies however valid they might be. It's a damn movie, Hobbits aren't realistic either, your argument is invalid. If you can't enjoy this movie, honestly, you are probably spoiling many movies for yourself.",Titanic

986,tennis_ace102,brilliant,9,23 November 2007,This movie is brilliant i only understood this movie when i was 9 but from then on it has remained one of my favourites.Great acting threw the whole movie. Leornado and Kate were brilliant as Jack and Rose.The love story of jack and rose is simply beautiful It was a dream love story that you could only wish for until the Titanic hit the ice berg and then while the chaos was going on there love for each other shined threw Any guy who cares for a girl so much that he helps her to surive yet puts himself at risk of death is beautiful What made this movie special is the love story The Love story made the movie not so predictable because you didn't expect there to be this different side of it we all know what happened to the ship but we didn't know about this romance whether it was non fictional or fictional by the end i was in tears because of how sad it was but also because of how beautiful it was from the plot to the acting to the writing the movie was just Beautiful.,Titanic
987,Mike-299,Can this be any more overrated?,1,11 April 1999,"There are movies that you don't care for the first time you see them, but when you think back it grows on you. So you see it again, and realize that it is, in fact, a great film. Then there is this overrated piece of drek. Now, I will admit it was beautifully filmed. But it was so overblown, so drawn out, that the more I think of it the more I hated it. It was unrealistic to the point of just being impossible for me to enjoy. The characters- with the exception of Jack, Molly Brown, and Thomas Andrews- were impossible for me to like, and therefore, care about. I know that Rose was supposed to be the heroine, but she was just a spoiled little rich girl. It's a shame this tripe won an Oscar for best picture.",Titanic
988,sexyrebl,A masterpiece!!,10,30 December 1998,"I saw James Cameron's Oscar winning epic Titanic and I saw a mesmerizing piece of art unfold before my eyes.  I couldn't believe how this movie just came together.  The visual effects were outstanding, the costumes were brilliant, the cinematography was wonderful, and (yes believe it or not!!) excellent acting.In my opinion Kate Winslet made this movie and deserved her Oscar nomination for wonderful performance as Rose.  Kate Winslet is truly one of the actresses for the future she has already had two Oscar nominations and she is only 23!!  She was brilliant but it wasn't her absolute best (her best is Jude see it for all you Kate watchers she is wonderful in this movie).  If it wasn't for Kate Winslet this story probably wouldn't have worked!! Leonardo Dicaprio was wonderful and he should've had more award praise for his performance but it wasn't his best also (What's Eating Gilbert Grape and he was nominated for that!!).  Now Gloria Stuart was good but I thought Kathy Bates should've gotten in instead because her character stayed real!!All those people who sat such bad things about Titanic are crazy because what's not to love.  I know everybody is tired of the song ""My Heart Will Go On"" is a wonderful song and it fits the movie perfectly.  This is a gem of a movie and when Rose looke up and saw Jack up there while she was going down with everybody was so pivotal because she them jumped onto the deck and saw that her life whole would be everything she is with Jack not with an arranged marriage with a controlling jerk (played brilliantly by Billy Zane!!) remember when Molly Brown (Kathy Bates) asked him at the dinner table are gonna cut her meat for her!!This was such a materpiece and the only drawback was why did the older Rose just throw the gem into the sea it was puzzling but that still doesn't mean that this movie  gets a 10!!!",Titanic
989,Rioter,"Three hours, and it shows...",2,21 January 1999,"Right off the bat, I'd like to say that in general, I think that three hour long movies have a tendency to repeat certain parts of its plot over and over to reach its intended length( See, The Thin Red Line) However, Titanic's producer and director James Cameron managed to do a noteworthy job of avoiding this snag. Unfortunately he made a bad movie in the process. Kate Winslet did a formidable job, excuse the phrase, of trying to keep Titanic afloat. Her efforts were hampered by her thoroughly unbelievable lover Jack Dawson (DiCaprio). His ""poor boy"" image was hampered by his less-than-rugged good looks. For a troubled kid who is supposed to lead a rough life, he hardly looks the part. Hollywood's traditional technique of making a male look more 'rough around the edges' (smearing a little mud on their cheeks and tussling the hair) fails miserably on DiCaprio, mainly due to his flawless face and hair. After two minutes of standing in the mist of the bow of the Titanic, he looks frustratingly like the Leo we see walking around town. The film tends to drag on when it could have been accomplished in little over two hours. By the time the film is over, the fact that the movie is longer than it took the actual boat to sink seems much more believable.",Titanic
990,Jamey - http://Welcome.to/MovieViews,Still a great movie,9,13 April 2003,"I saw ""Titanic"" a number of times upon its initial release. I loved it. These days, I must say that I have become fed up with all the whining and moaning that seems to arise whenever it is mentioned. Having not seen it in about four years, I decided to sit down and watch it again.It's still a great movie.I can probably understand the backlash. Some of Cameron's dialogue is cringe-worthy and James Horner's choirboy chorus soundtrack can get a bit annoying. And I'm sure that, after hearing that infernal Celine Dion song so many times, watching Cameron's ego-inflating Oscar acceptance speech and never hearing the end of its bajillion dollar blockbuster success, people got sick of hearing about this movie.But, it's still a great movie.DiCaprio and Winslet are both wonderful, and despite some of the wooden dialogue, the romance is enchanting. While the first half may be slow and somewhat padded, the final 90 minutes are anything but. The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most spectacular and terrifying things I have ever seen in a movie. I will never forget it.Anyone who can't admit at least that much is lying. So call me sentimental, but this is still a powerful, stirring film experience. 9/10",Titanic
991,Byers,Surprise Twist Ending That You'll Never See Coming,6,28 January 2000,"""Titanic"", a movie based on an obscure footnote of maritime history, is a mixed bag of a movie.  On the one hand there's the amazing visuals, the intense attention to historical detail, commendable performances and to top it all off, a nude scene with Kate Winslet.  On the other hand this movie has a sub-par script and a cliche of a plot, coupled with stereotypical, one-dimensional characters and a three-hour running time.  Even when you factor in the surprise ending (hint: it involves an iceberg) this film is far from ""the greatest ever""; in fact, I wouldn't put it in my top thirty. However, despite the fact that it is overrated, ""Titanic"" is still an entertaining piece of cinema and an enjoyable, if predictable, journey through history.",Titanic
992,Hamlet23,Greatest ever? Tell me another one.,1,2 August 1999,"This movie might well be the most over-rated film of all time.  It had a few good points -- foremost among which was the cinematography -- but these were overshadowed by the shortcomings of the movie and the ludicrous hype that surrounded it.  The film is full of stock characters, with the stereotypical and cliched Jack and Rose being the most prominent examples.  The entire movie was as predictable as the boat sinking at the end.  The dialogue is sub-par, to say the least.  The movie drags on and on forever.  The scenes in the present, for example, were totally superfluous.  I remember watching the boat leave dock and staring at my watch, not believing that I'd only been there for half an hour.  And then the movie, like the boat, just kept going.  After the ship hits the iceberg, the movie improves -- it doesn't have time to waste, so it can't waste it.  Even here, though, there were just a few too many last-minute rescues for my taste. This movie tries to attain the epic quality of ""Gone with the Wind,"" but it simply can't do it.  It has very little substance, and lacks the art of that film -- an actual classic.  If ""Gone with the Wind"" is a bit soap-operatic -- a fair criticism, I think -- then sitting through ""Titanic"" is like sitting through all 20 years of ""As the World Turns"" in one sitting.  It is not an epic, it is simply long -- too long, and pretentious.  This is the ultimate Hollywood movie in that it has so little too offer, and yet somehow it cleaned up at the Oscars, wins all kinds of undue praise, and heap money on it until it becomes the highest-grossing movie ever.  I hope that, box-office records aside, this movie does not remain famous, or keep this silly reputation of being a classic.  It does not have the quality of any of the great films it is often compared to.  It is big-budget fluff. One final point: on the voting scale, I gave this movie a ""1.""  And I will be honest: it is not quite that bad.  It could be ""2"" or even ""3"" material. But the way some people talk about this movie absolutely drives me crazy. It is not a great love story, it simply imitates a lot of other ones.  It is a product.  It is a huge studio production without very much heart or brains behind it.  I find it very sad the way this movie (and its male star, who at this very moment is trying to trademark his name) have been made into such golden calves.  ""Titanic"" exemplifies the era of big-budget fluff that present-day movie-fans have to deal with.  Once people stop buying into movies like this, actual quality may return to film.  I only hope that that day comes soon.",Titanic

994,whiteraven-4,This is a hit? (spoiler - if you are blind and deaf),4,3 March 2000,"After rave reviews and incredible marketing I still could've cared less to see this film.  Then a friend brought it over to watch.  So I did.  It was just what I expected. The big wigs pumped this balloon full of hot air.  The basic storyline reminds me of Shakespeare's classic ""Romeo and Juliet"" - a story of two incredibly stupid and starry-eyed kids which could only end in disaster. Unfortunately it isn't as well written. Money, timing and power fed this puppy through the mainstream American gut. However I couldn't stomach the silly writing and over-the-top special effects.  And then there's always the question of why they gave it a PG13 rating with the slow camera paneling across the naked female anatomy. The character's backgrounds seem highly contrived (a gambler who just happened to win a ticket to sail across the ocean and a young well-to-do girl trapped in engagement for money?) Then there's the matter of the ""suicide"" meeting where Jack tries to talk her out of jumping ship with tactics which would impress even Freud . . . if such tactics would ever actually work.  Well Rose and Jack make a lovely couple of crazy kids with their wild days of drinking below decks, standing on tiptoes, nude art sessions and making out in the backseat of a car - honestly, who put this stuff in a script?  I didn't know whether to laugh or walk away and find better use of my afternoon. As if this weren't enough bull to swallow, they add the whole search for the jewel.  Then, at the end, the old Rose drops it in the water.  She could have done that years before.  Was it some obvious imagery that totally missed me or did anyone else think she was whacked? Now we come to the best part - ""special"" effects.  And this cookie was loaded with them.  The water slosh was great.  But seeing the ship sink was a big disappointment.  Rather than using a tasteful display of the ocean liner in the murky black of night, Titanic brightens up the entire ocean better than the stadium lighting.  In fact it's brilliant enough for us to see the passengers fall like ping-pongs off the deck.  I think they should've used less CG wizardry and more brain power to sink the boat. Not all of Titanic was bad though.  In fact I loved it when Billy Zane's character slaps the silly girl around - it was one of his best performances. And during my favorite scene Rose drops Jack into the drink - the blue monochromatic coloring and the music are perfect.  [sigh] And then Rose is rescued.  What a disappointment.  We could have saved the jewel if she hadn't lived so long.  What a twist - I really thought the jewel would be recovered as the climax, or was the sinking ship supposed to be at the bottom of all of this?  Did this movie have some real purpose?  because I missed it.",Titanic
995,belannatorres,What a movie!!,10,17 July 2000,"What a movie!!  It's amazing what you can do with a couple hundred actors, a doomed ship and a director.  I find it very un-fair that Kate Winslet didn't win that Best Actress and Gloria Stuart didn't get the Best Supporting Actress.  I always cry when it gets to the part when...(WARNING!!  SPOILER AHEAD!!!)...Rose and Jack come to where the ship's builder is looking at a clock, his life jacket at his side.  And then when he tells Rose he's sorry he couldn't build a stronger ship, I totally burst into tears.  If you rent this flick, have your box of tissues",Titanic
996,kaleidoscope_eyess,horrible attempt to combine romance and disaster,6,9 July 2019,"While Cameron, the director, felt ""a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential to convey the emotional impact of the disaster,"" both the romance and the disaster failed. I loved the first part of the film, but my interest quickly lost after the second part began.
The power of the first part of the film lies in its exploration of social class -- my heart melted upon seeing how Jack attempts to behave like an upperclassman and how Rose enjoys Jack's company and his surrounding. I agree this kind of story sounds cliché and the encounter between Rose and Jack is unlikely, but this love story realizes the fairy tale that everyone of us deeply relates and dreams to become true.
However, the second part of the film immediately feels fake, kitsch, superficial and classist. It is lengthy and even melodramatic. For one thing, the most dangerous moment happens probably where Cal goes after Rose and Jack. The film abstains from any realistic and profound depiction of deplorable living condition in light of a disaster. Focusing on Rose, her family and her love interests, the film stages other common people as mere backdrop of the love story of an aristocrat. In the end, it becomes evident that Rose would survive and live a happy life anyway, which promptly overshadows the very existence and sacrifice of Jack.",Titanic

The artwork and the storyline really keeps you wanting more and more from this film. The acting was pretty good and the love couple of Jack and Rose definitely didn't make this movie boring because i wanted to see what would have happened in the end when the ship would have sank. Some very minors things with the movie was that the acting was a bit corny in a couple of areas, and the fact that they didn't go a bit more into detail with the characters but doesn't make it bad in anyway what so ever. Another impressive is that after 10 years people are still talking about how great this movie is, and for some reason you haven't seen it yet, GO WATCH IT NOW!!!",Titanic

However, now it seems that people are embarrassed to admit how great Titanic really is, for the simple reason really, that people made it famous. Many people now wish to disclaim the performances (particually that of Leonardo DiCaprio) just because after the film came out they became world-wide heartthrobs, and the fact that they delivered truly memorable performances is thrown aside.

The teacher said he saw it ten times, each time the feeling is different, I think, the next time, I will be what kind of feeling.
When the reality and dream conflict, when the desire and conscience on a log bridge, where to go? On the edge of life and death, the fear of the heart like drops of ink-stained gradually dispersed. What used to be called breeding, what is called integrity, may not be remembered at all at this time. The money, which had been so lordly in the past, was thrown roughly from a man's hand into the air like waste paper. The image of the aristocrat would not have any expression at this moment, only the flustered movements and hysterical crying.",Titanic
1001,krational-66550,Classic,9,18 May 2020,"Children are actually very similar to philosophers. When I was a child, the big issues such as the fate of life and death were intertwined almost every night. I often felt that I would die for a long time until the end of the world, when I fell down into the deep space with the cracked earth.The Atlantic ocean is as deep as the sea, can not see the edge of the sea and stars, floating people are insignificant, it is really desperate to desolate.I'm afraid of the sliver of silence when life sinks.I fear the eternal defeat of nature.What can we do? Then the earth rose, the volcano erupted, the lava became unyielding, and the ancient city was swallowed up. Mountains crumble. Villages and cities crumble. When the ocean roars, the hurricane is raging, the waves are high, and the island sinks?I looked into that little screen, and there was fear. That piece of water, so far dare not touch.Ten years later, this film has become the background color of time for me and most people.I know every piece by heart, every line of dialogue, every movement, every fluctuation.I use it as an example for many compositions and even English reading exercises.Ten years. Any movie can not stand the time and the population such a rush, the plot has become allusions, the truth has become common sense.Ten years. I went from primary school to college, and the hero and heroine went from their youth to their midlife crisis.However, even if it is known to all, even if time has sifted it into a leak, no longer able to block any mystery, it is still a myth.It is a myth that whenever we face it, we cannot help but shudder.Because no matter how hard the heart is, it will bow in the face of extinguished life and melt in the face of eternal love.I was holding the computer crying all over trembling, can not help but imagine that the cinema line, girls holding the boy's hand, a dialing you nong nong into the ground, hysterical to come out, the spectacular scene.Yes, we are looking for masochism, to use the greatness and disaster of the screen to confirm their mediocrity and happiness.Those couples don't know if they're going to end up together or if they're going to end up together. Ross and jack are going to be together forever. However, who in the beginning of love, did not like the pair of young people as desperate?Sometimes life just doesn't think about the future.What would have happened to rose and jack if they had both been saved in that disaster?To tell you the truth, I thought about all the possibilities to keep them both alive, and even thought that if they hadn't met, maybe rose would have been on the lifeboat and jack would have been fucking sleeping on the board. But what happens when I survive, I really don't doubt.There are more poor people answer: as in the revolutionary road, the marriage crisis ah, trivial life ah, buried passion ah, quiet old ah; Or because of class position did not combine at all (MAO probably read more). -- where to learn to see through the world of mortals.Isn't it annoying to come up here and preach? I just don't understand why two people who died together can't live together. Once so fit, why will separate.Don't tell me that it's easier to keep your job than to start one. There's nothing new under the sun. I just know how life goes on, and it goes on and on.Have you ever loved it? Have you ever cried and laughed, no matter what? Ever gone off the deep end? You have not subverted life, life to subvert you.And they, they loved so much. So close. So live and die together.Perhaps sometimes life is a naked subversion, dream and passion will be old -- but, is old, not dead. Passion grows old, love never dies; Dream will be old, ideal die; Man grows old, but his heart never dies.The scariest thing is, have not experienced old, began to fear death, have not loved, began to spit.I still believe in the amazing beauty of life, even if I can't see it after a while.To put it bluntly, I believe rose and jack will stay together for years, decades, and centuries to come. Just because old rose looks back, so beautiful.Welcome you to say that I am naive absurd, also welcome you to continue to mature desolate.Speaking of which, Titanic is the most wonderful romantic movie I have ever felt. It is like drinking honey wine, which is not to speak of.This is a gorgeous to the extreme, making the human difficult to do the background, but also delusion breakthrough time and life and death to the eternal love.Rose jumped up from the lifeboat and jumped to the window, the most beautiful for her bravery and greed.I have spent all my luck to meet you in the moment of my life.

He should stick with what he made famous, and that is the sci-fi/action genre. Titanic is such a sugar-coated load of crap...not only is it painful on the eyes, it is painful on the ears with that godawful song by Celine Dione. At over 3 hours, it is simply gruelling to watch. Leo DiCaprio is a terrible actor who looked about 5 or 6 years younger than he actuall is. Kate Winslet is talented, but this talent is wasted. The movie doesnt know whether it wants to be a teenie-bopper chick flick or an action movie, and the bizarre transition from one to another is even worse. I have watched many movies that top the 3 hour mark that I have thoroughly enjoyed (Gladiator, Black Hawk Down, Terminator 2) but these movies use the length to benefit the story, while Titanic simply uses it as an excuse for more explosions, more soggy dialog and an excuse for Winslet to get naked.

The ending was sad, not just for the couple, but for all the people who were separated from each other or died during the tragedy of the Titanic. This film portrayed it well. I hated Rose's mom and fiancé so much. I'm glad she didn't return to them and pursued her dreams and experience the life she wanted to live in the end. My favorite part was the process of the sinking of the Titanic, it was really interesting and educational, but also suspenseful and sad. Tbh, the Titanic should've had many test runs by the captain and crew before setting off, so it could avoid such tragedies. Then there could be a happy ending for everyone, Rose could still run away, but then the movie would lose purpose, so yea.

That is exactly how this movie made it's money. Crazed teenage girls. Don't even argue with anyone that says otherwise, this is the reason. This film was absolutely terrible. Sure, it's great for historical reference. NOT! Try renting the original Titanic film, it has a much more entertaining and informative story. This film, rediculous teen movie crap. During the time period that this movie came out, I must have asked all the girls I could find at one point or another what they would do after school. Simple answer. ""Go see Titanic!"" These are people dishing out 8 dollars a day to see a film!Not to mention all the boyfriends that were dragged into theaters kicking and screaming by their girlfriends (I know, I was one of them), the adults tricked into thinking this was an Oscar worthy film (which it wasn't) and the terrible story line. How and why did they spend so much money on this film?! How would they know it would gross 600 million rediculous dollars, buying all the people involved new houses and cars??? People must have been paid to see this movie, or say anything positive about it. And then there's the Oscars. Fortunately, the Oscar that Good Will Hunting deserved the most, it got, and that was that of best screenplay.

I'm just as clueless as you are, sorry. Wanna know my guess? They were being threatened by their obnoxious 9 year old nieces, or there were mobs of 14 year old girls outside of their houses threatening to give their lawns an uneven mow if they didn't put as many Oscar votes for Titanic as possible. Bottom line, spare yourself the 3 hours of your life you could use for something else. Go watch tomatos grow in a garden.

""titanic"" has a good story though, in spite of what several people have said in their comments. it's not a masterful screenplay, but it can stand up well next to most of the great epics in film history. i don't think that james cameron was trying to duplicate orson welles here. this is a very entertaining film and it is really sad to see that so many people have rated it so lowly. more than 5000 people have given ""titanic"" a rating of ""1"" on this website. i refuse to beleive that most of those people actually think this film is that bad. a vote of ""1"" would mean that you can find absolutely no redeeming qualities in this movie whatsoever. if ""titanic is ""complete garbage"" as some folks have said.... i'd be curious to see what other movies you have given the lowest rating to. as for myself, i didn't give ""titanic"" the highest rating of ""10."" i gave it a ""9."" it is a throw back to the kind of films that we rarely see come out of hollywood anymore. also... la confidential was not robbed at the oscars. i liked la confidential. i thought it was a real good movie. alot of people though, who have never seen a movie before 1990 might be overrating it a bit. there are several film noirs from the past that are more cleverly written than la confidential. besides, the people who are voting for the oscars are not some genius film students. they're no more intelligent than the average joe. so if you're gonna say that la confidential got robbed by losing to titanic, then you should realize that about 700 other pictures and actors over the last 75 years have probably been robbed as well.it's nothing new. prefering one film over another is a matter of personal opinion, and more academy members voted for titanic. this is not the world's greatest injustice, you guys. anyway.... anyone with half a brain knows that it was ""the ice storm"" in 1997 that got robbed, not ""la confidential.""",Titanic

But that is all it is and when you compare it to other Best Picture winners then it is nothing special and is for example inferior to Braveheart or Platoon. The only bad parts of Titanic are the flying scene and the Jack dying scene. Those scenes just make you embarassed in pain. Excluding those scenes the film is for the most part great. For example the opening or closing scenes are pure cinema perfection with emotional musical score that send emotions through your whole body. In fact even though there were a couple better movies since Titanic none had better single moments than a couple moments of absolute perfection in Titanic. However this is not a perfect movie and is in fact the most flawed James Cameron movie. How could Cameron go so over the top with the love story and keep a cheesy ""flying"" scene.

Every thing else was great. The best scene was the dock scene at South Hampton. That just shows that James Cameron is great at over the top set designs. The whole pretty much proves that but that scene emphasizes it. Another great part of it is the uniqueness of it compared to other Cameron films. His other movies are just run-of-the-mill action movies (okay T.2 and Aliens were much better then his others but his other movies are cursed by this).

We were taught about the Titanic in school, so when the movie came out, I thought it was pointless, we all knew the ship hit an iceberg and sank.Well after it came out on VHS, I happened to see it one day and it did not disappoint. I don't like the genre of romance so much, but this movie made me appreciate a good love story.Yes it was the classic Romeo and Juliet scenario, or rather rich girl poor boy. But it was so much more. The acting was superb, I didn't like Leo before this film, and Kate took the cake, especially when she was posing nude...This movie put a face (although fictional) to the thousand or so people that died that night in icy water off of the coast of Newfoundland. You almost felt the thousand knives stabbing you as Leo and Kate were plunged into the water. You kinda felt like the King of the World when Leo was flying high.The Movie was very well acted, the set was amazing, down to every last detail...even the plates said Titanic on them, you really felt you were in the opulent world of the early 20th century high society. The story telling was also beautiful. You also got a taste of what it might be like to party with the ""2nd class"" immigrants that were coming for a new life in America...I really felt the sense of adventure all the actors tried to portray.I highly recommend this movie.Not sure why it's not in the top 250 on IMDb, also anyone that would give this film 1 star doesn't know much about movies.",Titanic

Titanic came out in 1997 amid big buzz about whether it would be good or not.  And every early review was immensly positive.  Titanic was made to be large entertainment and a piece of historical evidence on which you could learn from.  And it was all that and much more. 
James Cameron created the Best Film Ever Made by the Hand of Man in All History.  He took some very good actors (mainly DiCaprio, Winslet, Bates, and Hill) to make this film which he wanted to appeal to everyone and it did.  This film won 11 Oscars for it's amazing achievment in the technical areas and in the acting, and production of this monumental achievment in film. With star-making turns from its two leads DiCaprio and Winslet.  Its Best Picture win was well deserved (if you ask me L.A. Confidential is a little over-rated and over-hyped about) its direction from Cameron is timeless and it IS better than The Godfather.  So if your asked at a party, ""Which film is the best film ever?"" Simply reply, ""Titanic."" Tata.thereturnoftheking's score/10 starsthereturnoftheking-",Titanic

It was a great movie & I ended up watching the drowning scenes over & over again And now, after 14 years & after graduation & employment, it is enjoyable & still keeping it's magic from acting & dramatic tragedy to the special effects & direction which also happens to be James Cameron the director of the box-office hit ""Avatar"" the highest grossing movie of all time Finally, I strongly recommend this movie for all future generations as our generation did by watching the Godfather & Casablanca",Titanic
1014,pingshar,The very greatest best movie in the whole wide universe every made by James Cameron,10,30 April 2012,"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time!! I loved how Cameron put a fictional story to have a tie-in with the real-life tragedy of the RMS Titanic sinking. .The acting from all those in it is superb. Billy Zane plays Cal brilliantly, Leo Di Caprio is one of the greatest actors in the world, and who better to play rose than Kate Winslet!? All in all this film is a must see, again and again and again!! I watch Titanic at least once a week, and twice on Sunday. Titanic never ceases to amaaaaze!!!You say there are other good movies out there!? I don't think so!!! Some people like Lawrence of Arabia, but I think it is far too dry. Who wants to watch a movie set in a desert!? It would have been much better if they had attacked Damascus from the sea!! Pass the beer!I liked the burning of Atlanta in Gone With the Wind, and the score was pretty good, but there were no words. What this film needs is a theme song. And a HOT love scene!! This is a romance, Margaret!!!Now Casablanca is a film with a good theme song. But there's not much of a plot. Can anyone remember the point of this movie!? It just meanders along like no one knew what the ending was going to be.What's with that long bus ride in It Happened One Night? And then all we get to see is Clark Gable taking off his shirt? Boring!!All The President's Men has some strong performances by Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman, but the guy who plays Richard Nixon doesn't look anything like him. The President was kind, the President was understanding, and the President was smart, too smart to get caught up bugging the Democrat Headquarters. Totally unbelievable storyline!! The Wizard of Oz has some nice singing by Judy Garland, but the CGI is pretty weak. Those muchkins don't look realistic, at all!! My Fair Lady has some good music, but the sets and costumes are pretty pathetic. Didn't look like London, at all. Looked more like Disneyland.Rebecca has a pretty good plot and a nice fire. But they seemed to have left out one little tiny detail. What was the name of his second wife?! Sloppy writing, Daphne!!North Buy Northwest has some amusing chase scenes and some clever dialog, but it is soooo predictable. Totally lacking in suspense.OK, Psycho has some suspense, even if it is short on dialog, but it is so flat. Now this is a film that needs to be redone in 3D!! Das Boot is long and boring. Sure, it is realistic, and life aboard a submarine IS boring. But it needs some excitement. Maybe they could steal an Enigma machine back from the British, or discover an underwater Atlantis or hit an iceberg or something, anything, to relieve the monotony. I know! Maybe they could dive through a wormhole and accidentally shoot a torpedo into the Titanic, or better yet, the Californian!! So there you have it. Titanic is without doubt the greatest masterpiece of cinema ever made. Period!!!!",Titanic
1015,lasse-uk,probably the worst film James Cameron has ever made,1,21 October 2004,"I don't even know where to begin, there are so many flaws mistakes and general errors. Hey I know how about starting by saying that the script is absolutely dreadful. Nothing happens for three whole hours. After an hour you just sit there and wait for the ship to sink already. I couldn't help cheering when the ship finally sunk. OK I admit there are a few good scenes in the film. For an example at the end of the film someone falls down and hits one of the propellers and makes a kind of dull ""bong"" sound when he does it and then starts spinning rapidly in the air. Most of the effects are alright but the general acting as well as the weak and boring story makes this the worst big budget film ever made perhaps aside from the Harry Potter series.

like in its hay-day. Amazing detail in this film. The only characters that weren't real in real life were Jack and Rose. But what James Cameron did with there story was something to see.

1017,gus81,A sterile example of post-modernism......,1,15 January 2005,"Well, this certainly put bums on seats. Great special effects, great cinematography, nudity, steamy sex scene, spitting competitions, shoot-outs, and a tragic ending to a beautiful love story - all aboard the S.S Titanic! This makes for, I'd say, the worse of the well-known Titanic movies. It had a much bigger budget and such better special effects, but for extreme lack of sincerity and authenticity it is by far the worse. The producers actually seemed to make an effort - in some parts at least - to include 1990s attitudes into a 1912 setting: note the rude finger Kate Winslet gave to the antagonist while escaping down the lift.Kudos to James Cameron for putting so much effort into building the actual ship from original blueprints and for focusing so much attention on realistic FX, and making the film, in parts, so profoundly historically accurate. But in those parts in which the film was not profoundly accurate, it was profoundly the opposite and disgustingly so. Shame on Cameron for making the focus of the film a soppy, clichéd love story; the kind of which we have seen dozens of times. And shame for making those scenes which were historically and poignantly accurate mere backdrops to this standard and fictionalised love story.But in our times, this kind of lowest-common-denominator love story puts bums on seats and millions forked out to see Winslet and DiCaprio fall in love, ride on the bow, and finally say a tearful, inopportune, goodbye.This is the failure of the movie. It is anachronistic, and the film voids itself off. On one hand, spending millions on accuracy - sets, research, costumes and special effects - will attract many people looking forward to good quality film-making and a solid telling of what happened that night - people who will then be alienated by the no-brainer love story. On the other hand, the assumed target audience of the film who are primarily excited by the love story are those who could not care less about the millions spent on historical accuracy. It is a totally anachronistic situation.James Cameron totally wasted a fantastic opportunity to make a brilliant film on the subject, a film that could have surpassed all previous efforts. Instead he devised a storyline totally entrenched in Hollywood love-story stereotype, of the type that anyone could see anywhere else, and simply set this aboard a historically accurate rendition of the Titanic. He did not understand that the real events alone of April 14-15 1912 were enough to fuel a heart-breaking story of tragedy and bitter irony, and instead he used well-worn cinematic tools to pitch the film at the lowest-common-denominator who can't be bothered thinking outside their own experience. 'Titanic' is just an example of the cultural sterility of our times. The 1958 film 'A Night to Remember' told a more genuine, authentic, touching and historically accurate version of the disaster with half the budget and half the special effects technology, and I think this is testament to the suburban teenage wasteland which is Cameron's film.Still, the film offers good old-fashioned movie-going thrills and spills. It has a classic format against-the-odds love story all. It also has great special effects, and employs intelligent cinematography. So as a form of entertainment, it is a jolly good romp to accompany a bag of popcorn. As a film about the Titanic - which it purports to be - well, this kind of story could have been set anywhere and at anytime. The Titanic merely made a good and exciting setting for the fictional characters involved.This is a bad Titanic film, and as James Cameron was aspiring to make a Titanic film, hence the title, he has failed. As time, the harshest critic of all, marches on the film will be seen more and more as a marketing vehicle of the late 1990s. Other, better, Titanic productions will remain holding their own as honest, accurate and sincere renditions of what really happened that night.Finally, the above-mentioned remarks about the anachronistic nature of the film make it difficult to rate, and hence the love-it-or-hate-it experience of this film. 'Titanic' straddles the ridge between well researched triumph and Hollywood farce with the dexterity of a three-legged elephant....Which ever direction the elephant falls is up to each individual viewer.",Titanic

It's been almost 20 years since I last saw Titanic, and after seeing it for the first time as an adult; wow, what a ride. I'm not sure even with today's visual effects and so forth if a remake would be able to do any better in resenting the liner, and capture the feel that James Cameron did. I really enjoyed Titanic, and happy to give it a 9/10. The dialogue in some places is a little unconvincing, along with some of the choices made ha-ha. Some things seemed ambit rushed, but with such a small time scale to work with, rushed in probably a unavoidable aspect. (Bar making Titanic a 4+ hour long film) Very cleaver writing to make Titanic a love story upon such a tragic event, no doubt just a story about the event would have been ""tragically boring"" so I enjoyed having something to keep me distracted (Heros and villains) while the Titanic ... did its thing. I recommend this film today and for the next 20+ years, and would be very interested if anyone would like to try and top it with a Titanic remake.",Titanic
1020,moviedoors,Very good once you get passed all the hoopla,8,18 November 2005,"I watched Titanic all the way through today for the first time in roughly 7 years today. I very vividly recall seeing this at the age of 14. I was a huge Cameron fan and it took a few weeks before I could even get tickets to it. I loved it. I was extremely pleased to see it win best picture. Then things started to get a little crazy. The backlash on that this film received was to be expected no doubt after such saturation. I was a slight victim of the over exposure myself. I never really had the urge to watch it when it would come on TV. I was overloaded on it and that Celine Dion song still annoys me to this day.But the hoopla has long since died out, at least for the most part. I watched the film with a clear head today, and you know, this is a damn good movie. It's not perfect or great by any means but I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been moved by it. Now more than ever, I cherished the loved story. The class warfare bit and Billy Zane's character (despite showing bits of compassion later in the film) were a bit stock, but the story of Jack and Rose was just plain wonderful. The nude drawing scene was stunningly beautiful and not in a ""she's naked!"" kind of way. It was simply a moment so tender I was almost moved to tears and the love scene, if you want to call it that, was almost as moving. No doubt, the way the love story affected me probably has quite a bit to do with the way my life has been going recently. I'm at a point in my life were I can truly recognize the feelings those characters were experiencing, but is it a ""bad"" thing that my life experiences can color a movie? I'd say the answer is obvious.The second half of the film is quite stunning as well. Despite knowing the ship was going to sink and having already seen the movie, I did not want to see the ship hit that iceberg. Watching the ship sink was exhilarating, but not in an action movie kind of way. It was heartbreaking to watch. From a technical standpoint, the special effects hold up remarkably well. I don't see how anyone couldn't at the very least give this movie the respect it deserves for it's technical achievements.Which brings us back to that backlash and the legions of haters. I wouldn't dare say everyone should like this movie, but at the same there's no doubt in my mind that many, many of this film's detractors wanted to hate it. For some strange cynical reason they refused to even give it a chance. It boggles my mind that there are still people that refer to DiCaprio as ""DiCrapio"". Please. Grow up.I really hope Cameron one day returns to character based movies, perhaps even a love story like in this film or like the one in The Abyss(easily Cameron's best). That's what always made his movies so remarkable and why they'll be remembered for years to come. No one's going to be talking about Aliens vs. Predator in 10 years but everyone will remember Aliens, and that wasn't because of any special effects, it was because of characters we cared about. Because of films made with heart. Films like, Titanic.",Titanic

The visual effects are amazing, but some of the acting is awful (Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet, and especially Billy Zane). The last 1 1/2 hours of it are an emotional powerhouse, but a LOT of the dialogue is cheesy. Also, it made me angry that Leo, Kate, and Gloria Stuart (she was good, but not great) got all the acting spotlight shined on them, when it was Kathy Bates' finely tuned performance that stole every scene and showed that she can truly do everything an actress can do and more. The Billy Zane character was poorly written, poorly acted, and poorly conceived. All he was missing was a pencil-thin mustache and an evil laugh. There was a lot of talk about how bad the script was. The script was great. Sure, the dialogue sucked, but dialogue is about 10% of a screenplay. And storytelling is the other 90%. James Cameron's storytelling abilities are, today, only matched by Spielberg's.Something I really hated about it was when everyone compared it to Gone With the Wind. What is up with that?!?!?!?! Sure, there are some similarities in the plot, but Gone with the Wind is regarded by many as the best movie ever and a classic. There is no awful dialogue. There are no awful , one-dimensional characters. There are no bad performances. It's just full of good old-fashioned Hollywood storytelling at its best. It is more entertaining than Titanic, too. It is a half an hour longer, but holds your attention even better than Titanic ever could. Plus, if you take into account inflation, Gone With the Wind made twice as much as Titanic in America alone. That is a true epic. Titanic is only a pretender to the throne. But it is a great movie.8 out of 10, ***1/2 out of ****",Titanic

Aside from all that, the computer graphics were ok, given the 200+ million dollar budget.I just don't get it. John Carpenter can make a cult classic like Assault on Precinct 13, or Halloween for a mere 100 thousand dollar budget. If you care to make the argument that ""well, that was in the 1970's,"" well you're wrong. Take for instance, Richard Rodriguez'  1993 hit El Mariachi. He made the movie for a mere 25 thousand dollars, and went on to earn more than 20 million. What I am afraid of is the sort of dismembering of the real creativity of writing, story, script, plot, acting, directing, that really make watching movies enjoyable. If you wish to add to the overblown hype to this mediocre trillion dollar production, shell out your hard earned dollars and buy the video, buy the soundtrack, buy the laserdisc, DVD, and rent it.",Titanic

Did the film make you actually care about 1500 passengers who died in the crash? Very unlikely. We're supposed to mourn the girl's lost lover instead. 1958's ""A Night to Remember"" offered both the more historically accurate account of the event and the human drama behind it. Along with ""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Titanic"" is a sad example of how the actual history is being replaced by Hollywood's fictionalized versions of it.

Its script was mediocre at best though some good acting did break through. However, in my opinion it had one major fault -IT WAS ANTI-BRITISH.Nowadays people don't seem to care about Hollywood insults to their country but signs of this prejudice appear in the film. For instance all of the British are portrayed as upper-class twits, cowards, etc who bumbled into this in the first place. The Irish appear as being oppressed and the Americans and Irish are all the heroes.

The direction was marvelous, the costumes, the music...everything was great. Except the acting.  I found all of the characters, except Molly Brown(Kathy Bates) and the Billy Zane rich-boy, totally fake.  Leonardo DiCaprio, on one hand, is an excellent actor.  If you watch him in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""-which scored him a nomination for Supporting Actor-you can see his passion for acting...in Titanic, you can see his passion for the paycheck. Another former actor is Kate Winslet, who was nominated for her role as Rose...C'mon, please!!!  I could have played a rich girl better than she did...and I am neither rich nor female.  The fact that she fell in love with the Jack Dawson character not only upset me personally, but it also disturbed me-in a very weird way.  I never expected to not like Jack Dawson...I just liked the Billy Zane character so much, I couldn't stand to see him lose-even if he did deserve it. I think the real problem I have with the movie is that I saw at least three better movies, and didn't think Titanic was anything great.

I went with my girlfriend (she is not a DiCaprio-lovelorn girl, she actually thinks he's gay) to the theatre to see this movie. I thought it would be a good movie to watch with her, since its basically a chick flick, and she would be happy after the movie, and really happy with me for wanting to go with her, I just wanted to make her happy. But those three hours in that theatre seemed to go longer than any In School Suspension that I have ever served in school. And believe you me, ISS is the most boringest part of school. I mean, at least in class you got your friends and chicks to check out, but ISS is like a prison. But anyway, before I get completely off the subject, Titanic is way way way stretched out. 3 HOURS! 3 HOURS is what they make you wait to see the ship sink. And thats it! In between those 3 HOURS all there is is two people that fall in love, one being a poor boy, and the other, a rich, easy girl. I mean, they just met, and she already took of her clothes and even had sex with the guy, aint that an easy girl?! So, all that happens is the movie wastes 3 HOURS of our lives, which I couldve used in other things, and show us a really cool sequence of how the ship looks and how it sank. You can see all that in the Discovery Channel, or even in the internet. The only reason why I dont give this movie a 1 but gave it a 6, is because it made my girlfriend happy, who which in turn later made me happy :) DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS MOVIE, UNLESS YOU WANNA MAKE YOUR GIRL HAPPY, WHO IF YOUR LUCKY, WILL MAKE U HAPPY",Titanic

Can be watched from start to finish once with only a dozen or so moments of cringing.However, what did sink right along with that ship was the prestige of the Oscar Award itself. Now the Oscars have given out silly ""Best Pictures"" in the past, and there has always been a creeping element of the Grammies' ""popularity contest"" about them that kept them from ever getting too ""high brow""; but with the choosing of ""Titanic"" as the Best Picture for 1997, I honestly believe that the Academy did serious damage to its reputation for many years to come. Previously, serious film lovers knew that while the Oscars certainly weren't a foolproof measure of quality; in retrospect, they have produced a list of the greatest films that, on the whole, stands the test of time just as well as any list created by the Cannes, Venice, Berlin or Toronto film festivals. But this year (1997) changed everything. Not only did they overlook one of the best films of the decade (""L.A. Confidential""), but they made an obvious bow to box office as a ratings ploy and lowest-common-denominator crowd pleaser. With time, the decision to crown an overgrown adolescent throwaway flick the best movie of the year will haunt them mercilessly-- if it doesn't already.",Titanic
1035,BoJangles-3,Even Cheesy Dialogue Can't Sink This Ship,10,3 January 2001,"James Cameron's Oscar winning Titanic was a great film that could be even better if given some better dialogue and some more mature acting.  Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do well in their roles, but a lot of the dialogue from Cameron is weak at best.  Winslet succeeds in her role much better than DiCaprio, although both have their good moments and their weak spots.  The supporting cast helps to bring the real life people of the Titanic to life, most notably by Kathy Bates.  What Cameron lacks in dialogue writing, he more than makes up for in the accuracy of the re-created ship and it's icy plunge into the frigid North Atlantic.  The film is worth viewing for the scenes of the ship's sinking alone.  James Horner's musical score is also terrific.  Cameron and crew have succeeded in making a grand epic as in days of old.  Get past the cheesy lines of the 2 stars and you will be in for one great ride.",Titanic
1036,hadar-20,"What, are you nuts?",10,24 May 2002,"A 7? This masterpiece gets a 7 on imdb? It's sad that 'Titanic' is lambasted by some people only because it was such a huge success on all aspects. This heart warming and heart wrenching love story, set against one of the biggest disasters of modern times, is acted and directed flawlessly, with sweeping score, fantastic cinematography, and its three hours pass so fast, it's amazing. Such emotional and cinematical power is rarely seen in mainstream holywood movies, and this movie deserves its Oscars and huge box office success. Kate Winslet and Leonardi De Caprio are especially good. Rose and Jack are unforgettable characters. James Cameron is truly a gifted filmmaker.",Titanic
1037,edwarddfrankenstein,The embodiment of everything wrong with cinema,1,8 July 2019,"There are few films that elicit in me such passionate loathing as this piece of utter rubbish. This is lacking in practically everything that ought to be in a movie. No aliens, no graphic scenes of cannibalism, no serial killers, monsters spawned by nuclear power, special effects obviously made from random objects found in the director's office, or surrealistic body horror. Also, no werewolves. I suppose the title should have given me a warning, it doesn't contain the phrases ""blood"", ""invasion of the"", ""cannibal"", ""walks among us"", ""massacre"", "" meets Frankenstein"", or ""from outer space""; all of which are generally good indicators of quality cinema. It's also filmed in this weird artificial style, which I hate. Mainstream cinema fans might like this style, I prefer my films to look like they were made in someone's garage back in the 70s. And then there's that awful theme song. If you want a good movie theme song, listen to Surfing Dead by The Cramps, the theme from Return Of The Living Dead; by one of the finest bands in history. There is absolutely no reason to watch this, it essentially summarizes why I only watch B-movies. You could probably make 100 B-movies with this budget, and all of them would be more interesting. Just watch The Astro-zombies instead; now that's a good movie. Cameron has sunk far from his days doing special effects on Galaxy Of Terror (his best work by far. Who could forget the infamous worm scene?). Also, does anyone else think that Decaprio looks like a giant hairless squirrel?",Titanic
1038,lilbuch22,This Film Brought Me To Tears,10,12 September 2019,"I am still crying as I am writing this review as of right now. I don't even know where to begin. I can now see why this film was one of the highest grossing movies of all time. The blending of genres was masterfully done through the style of a Historical Romance/Drama, and a Disaster/Action film. The writing was absolutely superb, for a 3 hour movie I found myself completely engaged not even blinking my eye. The costumes, music, performances, characters, cinematography, dialogue was so magical I can't even put words here to describe the beauty of everything put into this movie. The performances just take your breathe away. Jack and Rose's love story is so full of life and heart and what true love should be even if it's a battle or your not the same class and can't be together ounce you find your soulmate that's what love is about. Their characters felt so human and that really is what puts this movie at a whole new level. The camerawork is some of the best I have ever seen in any film. I don't even want to spoil how thrilling, chilling, beautifully well done the Titanic sinking part of the film is because it is something you just have to see for yourself and experience the devastating heartbreaking tragedy that occurred. James Cameron you are and will always be one of the best filmmakers to ever live and this is your ultimate masterpiece.",Titanic

1046,michael_hope,Simply amazing,10,9 April 2012,"I am, I think, one of the few people in the world who has never seen this film in the full before today.My sister and I went to go and see the film in 3D today. I have to admit, I was looking forward as well as a bit nervous about this film. There has been so much hype, the most expensive film ever (at the time), the 11 Oscar's, THE song, etc. I just hoped to god that I wouldn't be disappointed.To those of you who haven't seen it, you MUST go and see it! From start to finish the film is amazing. At the beginning when you see the- now- famous footage of the Titanic in it's watery grave to the very end when Rose dies (?), ever single moment of the film is timeless, classic and truly amazing.I'm sure the film looked absolutely amazing when it first came out but James Cameron's painstaking remastering into HD and then the 3D added just make everything look amazing. From the start where you see the Titanic in all it's spender as the hopeful passengers wave their loved ones goodbye, to the splendid 1st class suites and til the very bitter end where you see the Titanic crash under the waves to her watery depth's. Every single scene and every single image was so crystal clear it felt like you were there. Even after 15 years, the directing of James Cameron is just superb. Yes some scenes are amazingly cheesy, but you soon forget these moments and replace them with the true emotion of the final half hour. The old couple who hug each other tightly as the water slowly rises toward them, the mother tucking their children into bed and giving them their last bedtime story and of the course the moment Rose lets Jack go whispering ""I'll never let you go""Throughout the whole first half of the film you are swept up with the happiness and pure delight on Rose and Jack's faces, you watch them from good friends to falling in love, a warm feeling surges through your body. However you always have that small, tiny niggle in your head, knowing that it wont last, the moment we see Jack, eyes closed and at peace, slips down into the darkness of the ocean is constantly in your head.This story isn't just about love found and love lost. It's about relationships, throughout the film you see different relationships. fiancé, best friends, mother/daughter, father/son, parent/children, rich toff/servant. Each one, unique in it's own way, each one is precious to the two people involved. This film tugs at the heart strings because of the transformation of the happy times, all the way to the saddest and most terrible times imaginable. Combine that with James Cameron's amazing directing and the timeless score that creates goosebumps and sticks in the mind for hours after, and you have a truly remarkable film.",Titanic
1047,mjurado,"Great effects, but not enough to save Titanic from mediocrity.",1,25 June 2002,"By now everyone has seen this film, so there's no need to give details. You've heard all the pre-teen girls and middle-aged housewives rave about it. Now, here are thoughts on this film from a male. I don't have a vendetta against this film. Except being dragged to it twice and being forced to see it again on video. Oh, the humanity. OK, maybe I do have a small vendetta.Titanic is visually impressive. SFX are impressive as well. It's really sort of neat to see the whole incident re-created on film. As for the story, Titanic is at the same time a self-important and impossibly simplistic film. Characterization in Titanic seems to be done with a very large club; the dialogue in the same fashion. Don't expect any subtleties here. What you hear from the characters is exactly what is going on. It's pretty much a paint-by-number love/tragedy, and unless you're especially sappy, the dialogue is likely to range from flat and predictable to downright appalling. It reminded me of watching a couple at a junior high dance call each other ""pooky"" or something.The old woman at the start and finish of the film is a bunch of boring nonsense. Why waste the viewers' time seeing the heroine as an elderly invalid? No one came to the theatre to see that. They could have at least made her accent match Winslet's.You know the drill, the princess falls in love with the pauper. I'm not totally opposed to the romance picture if it's done well, but this one simply is not. They call each other by name in every sentence. Very annoying. A romance film is only as good as the dialogue and the scenes where you see it all come together. Sorry, but teaching a girl to spit before having her pose nude for pictures isn't really my idea of romance.It's also very clear what Cameron wants you to think. Except for Jack and Rose, every poor person has a heart of gold, and every rich person on the boat is evil and deserves to be, well, drowned like a rat. The passengers are stereotyped so badly the ""rich people being snobs"" scenes will likely leave you rolling your eyes. OK, they are bad rich people, and poor people are basically good. We GET it already.I find it puzzling that so much time was obviously spent on the effects, (which were, to be fair, excellent) and yet we get such a basic script that this basically becomes a thinly-disguised, well-targeted effects movie. Effects are great, but can't salvage a poor, eccentric script and below-average performances from its actors.Not much was made about the length of this picture, but I found it to be excruciating. It boggles the mind how Cameron could write the most simplistic script ever, and stretch it out to be so long that you start hoping the !@* damn !@(&$& boat would just sink already!Ahem.Cameron is great - at directing a visual picture. But don't expect him to write a masterpiece. Effects are great, but this film is far, far too long for a script with all the complexity of a coloring book. Visually stunning, Titanic is; no doubt about that. But when it comes to substance, Titanic is all wet.",Titanic
1048,Rockin_Joe_87,Drowning in a Sea of Love,10,15 March 2010,"If there's any movie that will make you fall in love, this would be it. The setting is beautiful and the performances from the cast compliment the film nicely, particularly the leading roles portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio and the deservedly Oscar-winning Kate Winslet. The romance shown is one that will have you in tears and will make you fall in love yourself. You do engage with all the characters nicely, particularly couples watching who are in love themselves, the story really draws you in, and also the ending is almost guaranteed to have you reaching for the tissues as you dry your tears. There is no wonder that this is considered possibly the most romantic movie ever shown on screen and the ultimate tear-jerker!",Titanic
1049,NL-Proud,I Really enjoyed it,10,21 January 2003,"And this coming from a thirty something heterosexual married male. Figure that one out will ya.I just read a number of the posts and I find it amazing the hatred for this movie. IT WAS A MOVIE. Throughout the history of movie making there have been mediocre plots and mediocre acting. Unbelievable sequences and inaccurate historical portrayals. I believe this movie rates average to above average in all these.This movie is typical Hollywood in every sense. Cameron wanted to do a movie that encompasses the non-fiction events of one of the most well known human tragedies with a fictional story. Fantasy meets non-fiction. So what if he didn't get all the historical events exactly right, but he did give an accurate sequence of events that lead to the tragedy. for example, The fact that Astor is on the stairwell as opposed to beneath the stack is irrelavent (even though his whereabouts cannot be truelly confirmed either way, the fact is he went down with the boat). The class stereotypes are very accurate. Todays society doesn't reflect such class division as it did at the turn of the century. Not all rich people in the movie were evil, just.....rich. The middle and third class just knew how to have a good time with what they had.The story does leave something to be desired, but it is a love story that has to fit inside 3 days. It was ok.What impressed me the most about the movie was the non-fiction that encompassed the story. A truely accurate dipiction of society of the turn of the century and the human errors that caused a horrible tragedy that should never have happened. 1500 people did perish with a very high percentage of them middle and 3 class. It still stirs something in me when I'm reminded of that stat.I say hats off to James Cameron for having the courage to even attempt this extremely expensive film. I guess someone believed it could a success. Both at the box-office and in theatres.1.8 billion.  Someone liked it.",Titanic
1050,BovieMuff-91,Powerful storytelling,9,15 November 2010,"I watched this movie when I was 7 yrs old, in a theater here in Bangalore, and - you guessed it - nothing went into my head. I remember even asking my dad what the round thing was during the ""nude"" scene! The only thing I remember was seeing my dad in tears when it ended.I watched it again just yesterday and I was moved to tears by the end. Everything just seemed to fit with this movie: the score, the visuals, the performances and the dialogue, all seemed to fit smoothly like a glove. OK, some of the dialogue was cheesy and made you go ""oh come on!"" but others were memorable even to the point of quoting.This movie was divided into two halves which differed so much that you'd be surprised they were parts of the same movie. But I have to say the second half showed a side of directing and storytelling I haven't felt in the fifteen years since this movie came out: it showed strength.James Cameron, I know now, kept Avatar on the back-burner, completed Titanic and then continued work on Avatar. I mean, what can I say. You gotta hand it over to him for making two of the most popular movies till date, and that too back-to-back. Titanic went on to sweep the Oscars with 11, and although Avatar managed just the 3, visually it was as stunning and marvelous as this one was.Fittingly the movie ends with Celine Dion's ""My heart will go on"". By then I was shivering and this song at the end brought all those bottled-up tears out! Titanic will be in my Top 10 movies of all-time for years to come. Nothing can beat its sheer storytelling power. Must watch. 9/10",Titanic

Then there is a bear, and it's after the stepfather, but the dog comes to save him. Then it gets rabies and the boy freezes to death. How did that happen? I though this was about a boat? There was only one in the beginning. My friend later explained to me that I fell asleep and had a dream that was more interesting than this movie.

Well they seem to forget that for six months this movie was all anyone could talk about. It was a phenomenon that took the world by storm. I remember I saw it with my parents and there was not a dry eye in the theater not one by the end of the movie. The first hour and half is slow but works it is a good love story which is obviously half the reason why the film succeeded because women loved it. I mean it is a very tragic story. By the second half however we see some of the best scenes in movie history. The audience literally feels what it was like to be on that ship while it was sinking. It is a terrifying hour as we watch people drown, die, we see kids being separated from their fathers. We see the sheer ruthless ness of the officers as they try to keep order on the ship. We see the third class get locked down below the ship like animanls not even given a chance to survive. The effects were excellent. The scenes that were effect shots were so perfect that you could not tell they were effect shots.To bash this film and say it is horrible is flat wrong.

The two of the strongest performances ever given by DiCaprio and Winslet, that it still remains unforgettable almost 25 years later.

So the love story actually goes like this, poor class man wins ticket for the titanic in a game of poker (I think its a game of poker) and rushes to get on the boat that is about to leave. So when he is on the a couple of nights goes by and he sees a higher class woman trying to attempt to commit suicide by standing threating to jump of the ship into the deadly ice water. So after he intervenes and stops her from doing this they then get to know each other and fall in love.But as this is just another higher class meets lower class love story the thing that got me was just the amount of innocent deaths that was caused some guy not spotting a bloody gigantic ice berg in front of him which then leads to ship sinking and drowning thousands of innocent people.I personally loved this movie it is a real tear jerker, You will be joining in with rose and telling jack not to let go at end of the movie.

The special effects of Star Wars Episode I or Starship Troopers are much better.I think the reason why I find this movie boring is not that it is badly done or the average quality of the special effects.

However, this is one movie that I find so disgustingly revolting that I cannot resist adding my unwelcomed two-cents.If you're one of the three people on earth who hasn't seen the film, PLEASE take my advice and find something more constructive to do with your time.Director/writer James Cameron has reduced a TRULY horrific event into a ludicrously trite love story that makes Days of Our Lives seem like a Shakespearean tragedy by comparison.  Instead of focusing the story on actual people and events,  Cameron took the easy way out and created a cast of dull, sterotypical characters who spout inane dialogue seemingly lifted from a tv-movie-of-the-week.  Rampant historical inaccuracies, cliched directing, uninspired acting, and ridiculously cheap sentimentality all add up to one over-hyped, overrated spectacle.The only thing more nauseating than the film itself was James Cameron's ""moment of silence"" at the Oscars for the real victims of the disaster. The ""movie"" Titanic has about as much to do with the actual disaster as the Police Academy movies do with law enforcement.  This film isn't a testament to human tragedy...it's a disgusting marketing ploy aimed at bilking moviegoers out of money,  while making a mockery out of those people who experienced an event that no one should ever face.",Titanic

The level of detail and accuracy this film possessed (minus the love story) is why it won so many oscars.  And yes, none of the actors or actresses won because of the cheesy dialogue.  Nonetheless, the producer and director definitely deserve credit.",Titanic

It's terriable, the story is boring and has been done about 1,000,000,000 times before! The story has been fashioned to suit the Directors vision of what happened, history goes straight out the door!! This film makes ""Bill and Teds Bogus Journey"" look lika a film of epic proportion which is probably the greatst film ever made(which of course it's not)If you want a classic may I suggest ""the Usual Suspects"" or ""Pulp Fiction"".

1071,Jax0524,A classic epic drama!,8,11 May 2008,"This movie may be the cheesiest film on the planet but I loved it!!! I don't know if I can express in words how great this movie is. All I can really say is this is a film that you will want to share with your grandchildren. I will admit there was a corny line or two especially on Leo Dicaprio's character and in my opinion I honestly thought Kate Winslet out shined Dicaprio even though Dicaprio did have his share of great moments in the movie. I really loved Jack Dawson but I just felt that his character was almost too one dimensional. When I first saw the movie I thought it would be a load of crap... boy was I wrong I was so entranced into the love story that I totally forgot that this was TITANIC so when the iceberg showed up I found myself sort of praying against all logic that somehow titanic would miss the iceberg, I even remember leaning to one side of my seat thinking if I did this the ship would miss lol. and of course when tragedy struck and the ship was sinking I was really caring for Jack,Rose and all the other passengers and even then I kept thinking maybe it will stop sinking and these poor people wont have to die. Throughout the rest of the film I was in complete utter shock I don't even think I blinked. even when Jack died I was in disbelief and in my head I was screaming along with rose for jack to wake up. The only time I cried in the film was at the very end of the movie when you see the titanic morphing into a new and pristine state and you see all the passengers inside greeting rose as she comes in then Jack extends his hand to her and they share a passionate kiss and everyones clapping, I was uncontrollable and the tears just kept coming. I thought it was perfect to end the film on such a bittersweet note and that music playing in the background just made my heart flutter. This is a movie you must see before you die!",Titanic
1072,Freebird314,Great Watch.,9,25 July 2009,"This movie is great but it's not perfect. I think all directors are good at their certain thing. Cameron is good for big sets, camera angles, story development and cinematography. But he lacks in character development and dialogue.This move was all around a great watch and it sparks interests in history. I just got through watching a few hours ago and still feel mesmerized but it. Sounds weird coming from a guy but Cameron knows how to strike a nerve. I can see why a lot of people think it's a 10/10. I myself feel like giving it that just for the feeling I have right now but I know it's far from deserved.The movie starts out with a team of explorers searching the sunken ship of Titanic. They find a safe and think they hit the jackpot. Their search was for a necklace but all they found were old drawings. But after cleaning them, they realize that the lady in the drawings is wearing the necklace they've been searching for. So, they show the drawing on the news and the lady in the drawing comes forward.Now, this is where the story actually starts. Rose (the lady in the drawing) is from a rich family. Well, you find out later that they're broke and using their good name to get by. But anyways, Rose feels empty inside. I guess I can understand how she feels. Her mother is pressuring her to marry some guy just for his money. She basically has to convince herself that she loves him but she really doesn't. Now, Jack (the guy who Rose ends up falling for) is a poor guy who only got tickets to Titanic on a ""lucky hand at poker"".So, we all know the story. Rose feeling empty, tries to kill herself but Jack convinces her not to. This is where the movie turned into a clichéd. The plot was executed very well but we've all seen the story before. Jack gets invited to a dinner party with Rose and her rich friends, where he acts like a fool. So, her fiancé and mom forbid her from seeing Jack. But you can't stop true love can you? I also said the dialogue wasn't good. Well, other than the clichéd love mumbo jumbo, the lines didn't fit the times. Yes, I know it's a fictional story fit into a real event but it's still a real event and you have to treat it like that. I would think people wouldn't be saying, ""Yee Haw"" in the 1900's. There's a lot of dialogue that just doesn't fit the times.But does that make it a bad movie? Not at all. This movie makes you forget about all the Hollywood clichés and concentrate on the subject at hand. Titanic is a great all around film and for being three hours long, it didn't feel that long. It actually needed three hours to get the full story out. But the movie makes you feel sad and scared. It makes you feel happy for Rose and Jack, (why can't someone love me like that) and it puts you at the edge of your seat. The transitions are great to, no choppy directing work. James Cameron always delivers.So, overall, I give this movie an 8/10. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it's a great flick for anyone to watch.",Titanic

I will admit the love story was a little annoying and a waste of time (they had to waste the first 2 days some way) but i dont think anyone can disagree that the sinking of the ship was a amazing and horrifying thing to watch.

1077,outadisworld,Excellant,7,3 January 2002,"I recently saw this great film after avoiding it for nearly three years, and am sorry I did. The work they put into this movie is incredible, just about all details concearning the ""unskinkable"" ship herself was flawless. Only this year have they matched the Special Effects. The Directing was awesome, couldn't of been better, But what really stands out in my mind was the Score. The music fit the movie so well, It caused the viewer to really expierence the feelings of tragedy, love, excitment, suspence, grace and pain all in one. It wasn't just threw into the movie, it described the essence of the film, and made the movie seem that much more real. The Ending was very tragic, and yet very exciting at the same time. The entire moive was just incredibly moving. Even Leonardo DeCaprio, who i've never been impressed by, pulled of a surprisinly well done acting ability. Kate winslet really made the movie though. I would recomend this movie to anyone who appreciates great detail and tragical drama, even those action lovers (like myself). But this movie isn't to be taking lightly, It's a journey to the past, a chance to expierience history as it was, and does an incredible job at it. I feel real sorry for those who do not see it like that. A very captivating Film, I am not surprised at all it's the biggest money maker of all time.But this movie isn't to be taking lightly, It's a journey to the past, a chance to expierience history as it was, and does an incredible job at it.

1078,bainslie,almost like a time travel movie,4,10 February 2002,"This movie,""Titanic"", has great moments in it such as the dramatic sinking of the ship with all the intense desperation that event brought about in the crew and passengers as they struggled to live. There is no denying that movie has appealed to audiences around the world. Titanic fever has once again hit young and old and I'm sure books produced about this tragedy would have sold well. My frustration with the movie was not the special effects which were brilliant but rather the way in which the two main characters, Jack and Rose, acted in the movie. It was almost as if the two characters had hopped into a time machine and magically appeared on the deck of the Titanic behaving just as they would have done in our era. Who really would have tolerated the activities of Jack and Rose as they moved about the ship in such a free and easy way? The strict manners of 1912 were not the easy manners of our era. I for one did not shed a tear when Jack went under the water in 1912 as I would have done if he had drowned today (because today he would have been at least a real person of our time). The Jack in this movie is so out of place and time (and Rose is too liberated in her behaviour for that era - really the love scene in the car is a laugh a minute). The real heroes of the Titanic were the crew who sacrificed their lives for the safety of the passengers, the poorer passengers who lost their lives because of the preference given to the rich in allotting spaces on the lifeboats and those men who bravely remained behind to let their wives and children get onto the few lifeboats available. Fictional characters such as Jack and Rose simply created to appeal to a late 20th century audience do these real heroes of 1912 a great disservice. ""Titanic"" is a movie to see because of its special effects but it is hardly memorable in its presentation of its lead characters.",Titanic
1079,CazMcGovernMcKinnon,setting this movie straight,10,4 January 2008,"Okay, once and for all- this is the ultimate truth of Titanic. First of all, the same people who watch arty, quirky B budget films that are often viewed once a year in French in some obscure small cinema who are always complaining about under appreciation and narrow mindedness also need to be aware of the fact that often they are the ones being prejudice towards the 'hollywood' films. This movie is not insanely clever. It is not particularly intellectual. It certainly is not modest and yes it is embarrassingly commercial and almost prides itself for being 'Hollywood junk'. Now, it is extremely difficult for me not to judge this movie on those terms but on the other hand, there are elements of it that are wonderful and sensitive. 1. It is emotionally evocative and truly emphatic 2. The acting is incredible on Leonardo Dicaprio's side. (She was horribly miscast and Winslet is one of my favourite actresses but this part is not meant for her) Everyone with exception of her does a superb job though except for that horrific actor who plays her fiancé who i have yet to see again so obviously I'm not the only one who thinks so.3. the special effects are TERRIFIC 4. The script is wonderful and brilliantly delivered 5. At the end of the day a wonderful love story and truly heartbreaking 6. It manages to grab the audience and show them exactly what it would have been like to have been apart of this complete tragedy. For these reasons, I truly believe Titanic is a good movie. If you have any brains, of course you will not try and convince yourself that it is not a movie that didn't set out for the blockbuster cash because yes it is a sell out But who says that a sell out cant be terrific?It is not a perfect movie, but I am giving it 10/10 because I honestly believe that the love story is beautifully portrayed, the direction is amazing (and I loathe James Cameron) and the cinematography and score are incredible.

Well I watched this on video and was stunned' take a historical disaster and turn it into a romance novel' lol james Cameron has arrived. Its a real shame because I really liked the terminator' but that was when he was broke and visual effects were in its infancy the irony is the more money he makes the worse the movie and its not like this was a one off' it spawned other historical disasters like pearl harbour which was a titanic rip off. But the main problem for me was the whole movie surrounds the three main characters and everyone else on the ship was just window dressing and I like a lot of other guys couldn't wait until the ship sank. The only good thing I have to say is it made a big star out of dicaprio, and he has went on to bigger and better things. So this movie was a real bummer for me and a lot of others i'm sure.",Titanic

It was pure genius to entwine history's most well known ship-sinking with a raw love story. Despite knowing it isn't completely true, you cannot help but think that it could've been one of many catastrophic stories within a catastrophic disaster. I believe the mere plot line kept faults in acting skills, etc so implicit that it is very hard to pick out any sort of fault. Acting skills overall were exceptional and cinematography leaves you awe-struck.This combination has only made this film what it is today - top of the all time box-office around the globe, and it deserves it: a perfect masterpiece.",Titanic

However i did come out feeling like i was mourning a loved one.

1083,d-l-polonsky,"The Blandest, Stupidest Account Possible of One of the Biggest Disasters in History",1,12 May 2012,"The producers and writers of Titanic obviously believed they'd bore and alienate the targeted teen and twenty-something audience to the point of losing them if the characters had the attitudes, mannerisms and style of speech that was appropriate for the time, so they had Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) and Rose (Kate Winslett) speaking contemporary dialogue in a contemporary style, or at least contemporary for '97. A young man in 1912 would not say, ""You seem more like an indoor girl."" Aside from a certain hostile type of mental patient or the most outrageous and anti-social bohemian agitator, young adults in 1912 did not repeatedly tell their elders to shut up. The creators of the film are counting on what they perceive to be the teen and young adult's lack of knowledge or interest in the values and social customs of the very early 20th century. Since they want the audience to get swept away by the drama and romance of Jack and Rose they want them to relate to everything about them. I remember that this was billed as somewhat of a a fantasy re-imagining of a real event, but this type of historical revisionism, I think, in which human behavior is simply made more familiar, is an insult to any viewer with a 3-digit I.Q. One continuity problem that really gets me is how, when the ship is sinking and Jack and Rose are still inside, the water level is lower and the water becomes calmer around them every time they have a conversation. Again, the makers of the film don't want the reality of the disaster to encroach on, or distract us from, the passionate young romance they're trying to draw us into. Clearly the creators of the film think that the romance is a bigger draw for a major segment of the audience than the story of an enormous disaster that killed over 1,500 people and I'm sure they're right, but often when true and fictional stories exist in the same movie, one weakens the impact of the other, and it's certainly true in this case. I haven't seen the new 3D version but I assume the only change is the 3D effect. This is a bland, pandering, intelligence-insulting and epically overrated epic.",Titanic

1085,ElizabethCoral,Wonderful...,10,15 April 2006,"Well, I think it is about time that I commented on ""Titanic"", one of my all-time favourite films. I have wanted to express my appreciation for this film for a long time, and I think that today, the 94th anniversary of the tragedy, is an appropriate time to do it...I first saw this film on April 22nd 1998. I wasn't expecting very much...after all, you know how it ends...the ship sinks. But wow...I was absolutely blown away by ""Titanic"". I literally could not think of anything else for weeks on end, such was the effect it had on me. In short, ""Titanic"" awakened my interest in cinema.The film is presented as a love story between Jack (DiCaprio) and Rose (Winslet). Jack is a poor, steerage passenger, and his character represents the least likely group of people to survive the disaster. Rose is a wealthy first-class passenger, and she represents those most likely to survive the disaster. They fall in love against the odds. And although some people find their story corny, I found it incredibly touching.The acting is excellent throughout. Kate Winslet is a revelation as the feisty heroine. And Leo DiCaprio is perfect as Jack, the winsome ray of sunshine. The real stand-out performance for me was that of Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews the shipbuilder...his final scenes are truly heartbreaking. Also worth noting is the wonderful cinematography, the beautiful, historically-accurate costumes and James Horner's fantastic soundtrack. And, of course, Celine Dion and ""My Heart Will Go On"".I will admit that this is not a film for the cynical. It is not your typical noisy disaster movie...the over-riding message of ""Titanic"" is that self-sacrifice is noble, and that true love can conquer all, even death. I cannot describe how emotional the ending is...Rose makes a promise to Jack, and she keeps it...the ending at the top of the stairs is...gulp...I'm going to start crying now! A fine tribute to all those who died aboard the great ship on April 15, 1912. Thank you James Cameron!",Titanic

Many considered it one of the best films in history, I have no idea why. Titanic is in no way a bad movie. The scale of destruction of the title ship is gorgeous and the cinematographer is fantastic. Yet nothing else about the movie is all the great in my opinion. The acting is not bad, they just don't stand out. The dialogue was most cheesy and not all that powerful. None of the performances keep me that invested which is bad considered the two and half hours that Titanic milks its romance. The film feels like its five hours long and I constantly looked at the time to see when it was over. Personally I don't think romances are the type of movies that need to be three hours long, but that's just my opinion. Overall the last 30 minutes or so of titanic are fantastic, but it takes a while to get there with nothing really keeping you invested. If you like romance movies you will most likely love this movie, but as for me it felt a drag of a romance that didn't need to be that long.",Titanic

1092,Admiral-3,Sinking Feeling,10,10 September 1998,"Depending on what crowd you're a part of, it may be cool to your friends to like *everything* that is popular without forming your own opinion.  Or, conversely, it might be cool to *hate* everything popular without thinking about it.  This seems to be the basis of most amateur reviews of Titanic I 've read.  The truth is that this is a terrific film which emotionally chronicles the death of 1500 people on a doomed luxury liner.  Every movie needs a plot, though, or the fantastic last third of the film would have no meaning.  I am not a particular fan or detractor of either Leo, Kate, or James, but all three work their professions to perfection.  Jim writes and directs the film with real feeling and intelligence, and only in the movies is dialogue also perfect.  There is never any confusion as to what is going on at any moment, and Leo and Kate both give outstanding performances as the doomed lovers.  The historical characters are cast with uncanny resemblance (especially E. J. Smith), and the effects are so perfect that you hardly realize that what you're looking at is not real, and probably wouldn't know if you hadn't been told.  Horner's soundtrack is at first wondrous, and becomes haunting as Titanic's fate is sealed.  My only bone is that Cameron doesn't know port from starboard.  The bottom line is that this is one of few films I've seen where the fate of the characters is of utmost importance to the viewer.  You know Kate survives the wreck, and Kathy Bates as well, but what about the rest.  These characters have the feeling of being real, breathing, men and women, and for good reason:  many of them *were*.  This is not a tragedy that belongs in a pop culture tug of war.  I've seen the film only twice, and have been moved both times.  And perhaps the best thing about historical dramas like this is best summed up in Hitchcock's own view on suspense.  When the viewer knows the potential outcome, but the characters don't (Hitchcock explained it as two men at a table discussing baseball, while only the viewer is privy to the fact of a bomb ticking beneath the table). Titanic is a marvelous film, and the budget, politics, etc, involved in the Hollywood aspect of this memorable masterpiece are moot.

The characters in this movie were there only to look good and smile broadly whenever the camera focused on them. And as for the award winning effects, they didn't look remotely realistic.

Leonardo DiCaprio gives the performance of his career as an enthusiastic, unselfish bum who saves a young woman(Kate Winslet) from leading a shallow, predictable life.  I am sick and tired of people ripping DiCaprio's performance because he was simply perfect for the role.  I am hardpressed to find another actor that could exhibit the freshness and excitement of DiCaprio.

The screenplay and the acting are the most important aspects of any film, and since Titanic was deficient in both areas it should not have received the honour of best film. Granted, the special effects are wonderous and should be honoured, but as a whole the film was not a masterpiece, it did not inspire, and they took far too long to die.

In fact, it's one I kept watching over and over and had virtually nothing to do with Kate Winslet (who is clearly older than 17) being in there. I wish I had seen it on the big screen.Leonardo plays a very amiable young man in this one and Fabrizzio is a good companion. One qualm is that, once Rose appears on the scene, Fabrizzio pretty-much disappears. But it's true that the central interest lies with Jack and Rose. The other characters are portrayed well in their various roles, totally believeable. You develop real feelings for them, even the two unfortunate lookouts who see the iceberg just a few seconds too late.The special effects of this film are excellent. There was nothing anywhere to suggest during the sinking that this wasn't really happening as you saw it. And the music and instrumentation is well-suited to an ocean voyage.True, they've rewritten history in many places, but it enhances the drama. Some of the dialogue isn't life-like; again one must remember that it isn't meant to be totally believeable. The final scene (watch it if you haven't) could have been skipped. The fairy-tale romance between Jack and Rose could be thought of as too contrived, but it is nonetheless striking. For these reasons, some people will not like it. Also, three hours is extremely long for a movie. But in my case, having read some of the scenes they cut, I wish it could have been four hours long!9/10",Titanic
1101,Beeracuda,IMDB Users got it right,8,26 March 2003,"Sometimes, when I look up certain movies, I simply can't believe my eyes. Some of the worst movies I've ever seen have been given generally high ratings, and vice versa.  However, when it comes to ""Titanic"", the users here got it right on the mark.  At the time of this writing, the users have given the movie an average of 7.0.  Not a bad film, but certainly not great.I won't get into the movie much here, as most people have probably seen it already anyway.  However, I will point out that the area of the movie that I hate the most is the desperate attempt at a love story.  It truly was not necessary in a movie like this.  Well, at least not a long drawn out love story anyway.  I really got SOOOO sick of hearing the two main characters yell out each others' names during the last hour of the movie - ""Jack!!"" ""Rose!!!""  ""Jack!!!!"" ""Rose!!!!"" UGH!!!  What a dialogue!If you haven't seen this movie (what rock have you been under the past 6 years?), I would recommend viewing it.  It does have it's good moments. Just beware of forced-down-your-throat dialogue and love stories.",Titanic

I also like the positive outlook this film has on betting which makes me more comfortable with my gambling and Kate Winslet also looks a lot like my sister so that made Kate all the more sexy for my sausage and love balls.",Titanic
1103,Albicastro,Unjustly Reviled,9,16 October 2002,"While I am sure that many of the negative reviews this movie has received are sincerely meant, I can't resist adding that I think Titanic has suffered, more or less unfairly, from its tremendous box-office success.  It is always hard to like a winner, and this makes it  difficult to give this film, both over-rated by some and under-rated by others, a fair assessment. I can only say that I feel that for all its obvious shortcomings, Titanic is an exceptional film.  At roughly three-hours of running time, the movie never feels long and is never dull.  It is both funny and genuinely moving by turns.  Whether intentionally or not, James Cameron has endowed the characters and situations in this film with a simplicity and a monumental resonance worthy of a great Nineteenth-century melodrama.  While it is not one of the greatest films of all time, Titanic is nevertheless an magnificent production well worth repeated viewings.",Titanic

1106,fcurry,Passing (or Sinking) Fad,1,10 August 2001,How on Earth did James Cameron sign on to make this! Fortunately at least 1/3 of the film is spent on a not-so-bad sinking scene...but still that's no excuse for a twisted overrated love affair that desperately wants to be Gone With The Wind or Spartacus but falls victim to its plain stupidity. No one talks about this movie nowadays or even whimpers at the soundtrack anymore which REALLY ticks me off because these are the same people who saw this film 178 times. Hollywood should stick with budget-busting action films like Die Hard that have stayed popular for nearly two decades.,Titanic

For some reason the nomination board have agreed that Titanic is one of the most revolutionary films ever made...Little seems to be asked of when watching this film, never really challenging the viewer, and ensuring that there is a distance kept between the film and the audience at all times. Whilst there are strong acting performances in it, Titanic seems to drag on with a short period of concentrated action and meaning.Could this be the most overrated film in history? It certainly seems that although winning 11 Oscars (only second my Lord of the Rings: Return of the King) Titanic doesn't appear to earn more than about 3 of these, with a vast amount of money poured into a film that nominators seem obliged to award Oscars to.

1112,rainbowpoet,"Beautiful, Lyrical, Spiritual...A Wonder to Experience!!!",10,28 May 2008,"Titanic, what has been called by some ""the best movie of all time"" and by others ""the worst movie of all time,"" is absolutely incredible! Not only is it a movie; it is an experience! Let me say, to begin, that I am a teenage boy, and practically every one of my friends laughs and scoffs at this movie, especially when they learn that I like it! I just can't believe my ears whenever I hear them say things like ""I've never been so bored in a movie in my life!"" or ""Dude, that ain't cool!"" or ""You can't like that movie!"" or ""What a disgrace to history!"" or ""I want my three hours back, along with my sanity!"" Each one of these quotes is direct and an accurate depiction of their feelings toward this magnificent work of art. There are so many things to be remarked upon in this film! First, let me say, that Leonardo DiCaprio is even more beautiful than Kate Winslet, which is definitely saying something! I completely understand and sympathize with all of the teenage girls who used to kiss their TV screens whenever he would appear. You ladies have wonderful taste! Furthermore, his performance was exactly what it should've been. It was dramatic when needed, subtle when required, sarcastic and glib when appropriate... There was absolutely nothing wrong with his portrayal of Jack Dawson. There were so many charming moments, like when Jack is teaching Rose how to spit, and he gets ready to spit a giant spit ball, and Rose's mother and mother's friends suddenly appear out of nowhere, or when he starts drawing his glowing portrait of the angel that is Rose DeWitt Bukater, and the beautiful, wordless piano lyric sweeps the viewer off their feet. It's the moments like that, so well-thought-out and well-put-together, that make this film stand among the greatest of all time.The next thing to remark upon is Kate Winslet's performance, which was even better than Leo's! She captured the melancholic poetry, romanticism, intelligence, poise, lyricism, and beauty of her character Rose. The moments just before Rose meets Jack, when she's running to the back of the ship to commit suicide after having escaped dinner with her perilously wealthy, sycophantic, judgmental, hypocritical crowd, are thrilling and devastating. They represent the worst of the darkness in her character, and I happen to find them fascinating. In contrast, nearly every moment she experiences with Jack before the ship crashes, is romantic and real. Sure, their story is not historically accurate. It isn't supposed to be. The movie is meant to be a work of historical ""fiction!"" With historical fiction, there will inevitably be facts that have been twisted around to fit the more dramatic and recent interpretations. That goes with the definition of the genre.Lastly, the music in the movie is by the illustrious and unparalleled composer James Horner (my personal favorite.) Titanic is his best score to date, and I have every single one! Titanic's score is an explosion of diversity, lyricism, simplicity and complexity. It unites so many different styles of music, each of which represents a class and type of passenger on the ship. Hats off to Mr. Horner! He is a genius! Not even the overrated but brilliant John Williams can match his creativity and talent! He should be worshiped, as should this movie.",Titanic
1113,kbgnphillips,Amazing,9,20 May 2008,"'Titanic' is an excellent film by director James Cameron, and is a timeless classic. Titanic is very historically-accurate, yet the movie itself is also amazing. Kate Winslet stars as Rose, a spoiled rich 17-year-old girl who rides on the Titanic with her first class mother. Rose fall in love with a boy named Jack (Leonardo DiCapprio), to her mother's (and her fiancée's) great disapproval. The end is tragic and heartbrEaking, yet beautiful.

The whole film seems so realistic and you really feel for Rose (Kate Winslet), who I thought looked gorgeous throughout the whole movie, and has a fiery personality and vast intelligence. I also loved Leo DiCaprio's character of Jack as the traveling starving artist and helps Rose realize her dreams that she thinks she'll never be able to achieve. I love how realistic everything was, including the beautifully done vintage costumes, hairstyles and sets, which make you feel like you're really there. The production team got the sinking of the ship quite accurately according to history, and that was fantastic that they did research so diligently. This movie is fantastic and deserves all the recognition that it has received over the years.",Titanic

Jack, portrayed by Leonardo DiCaprio is the perfect character. Leo played the character so well that I could almost believe the story was real.

1116,cinemaniac_x,"An epic, a classic, and one of the greatest love stories of all time",10,28 December 2010,"What movie comes to mind when you think of compelling, memorable characters, spectacular visual effects, a fantastic score, and a beautiful, tragic plot? What movie has captured the hearts and imagination of people of all ages around the world? What movie has retained its charm and ­appeal for over a decade, and has earned a rightful place in cinematic history? The answer is Titanic, the 1997 film that opened with low expectations and then astounded the public with its massive success. As the highest-grossing film of all time and winner of 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, Titanic raises hopes for moviegoers and does not disappoint.First, consider an undertaking so daunting that many would deem it impossible: recreating the RMS Titanic and its fateful sinking. This task undoubtedly required much time, skill, and effort, not to mention a huge budget – at the time, Titanic was the most expensive film ever made. The ship's splendor shines throughout the movie and adds an atmosphere of magic that film sets rarely manage.Another element of the film's success is the superb, talented cast. Most notably, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet give commanding performances as Jack and Rose, the young star-crossed lovers separated by ­social class on the maiden voyage of the doomed vessel. They are cast perfectly; a better choice could not have been made. Along with the rest of the cast, including Billy Zane as Rose's wicked fiancé and Gloria Stuart as Rose at age 101, they allow the audience to join their journey and share in their emotions and experiences. By the conclusion, viewers feel very close to the characters and truly care about them, which is why the movie is so poignant and tragic.So many years after its theatrical release, Titanic still has not lost what made it such a success. This moving, simply beautiful story about fate, disaster, and the power of love has proved to be a timeless classic and an epic masterpiece.",Titanic
1117,2004RedSox,A Great Film - Even With A Flawed Love Story,8,24 July 2005,"Lot of men truly hate this movie. I don't blame them. An ultra-silly love story that is basically unrealistic as well as naive; it's a purest example of puppy love.However, I really do think this is an excellent film. You take away the love story, and you will see a very accurate portrayal of an very tragic event.There are some scenes that will break everyone's heart. One is the old couple waiting to die in their bed as their room is being consumed by water. Another is the string quartet playing music while death and destruction surround them. The scene that really wrenches my gut is when the captain commits suicide. I find these scenes very emotional mainly because they probably actually happened.Is the love story really corny? You bet. But many films such as ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", ""The English Patient"", and even ""Lord of the Rings"" have lot of silly sentimental corny love story lines but they are much more acclaimed than Titanic. I have a feeling the reason why this film got so much bad rap is that much of the audience are very young females and that their being head-over-heels over DiCaprio annoyed lot of men. (I think DiCaprio DID do a mediocre performance in this movie.) But the silly love story in my mind didn't affect the emotionally devastating impact I had watching the powerful sequences of death and dying. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the only other film that affected me more than ""Titanic"" in showing the horror of human beings struggling to survive.",Titanic

A lot of people dismiss this film, saying it's got rubbish acting, uninspired directing, overlong, whatever. I can guarantee that none of these things are true. Titanic truly is a masterpiece, a landmark in the history of film. I first saw this film last year. I'd heard about how good it was, but thought it might be a little disappointing. But honestly it was breathtaking. I won't say anymore, just go watch it. Watch. It. It is one of the best movies you will ever see. Maybe even the best.

Plain characters, banal plot, idiotic mistakes about historical facts (Picassos famous cubist painting ""Maids of Avignon"" sank in Titanic, as you you know from the movie now!!!), huge model of the ship and big big money for brainwashing -- thats all. Artistically the movie was more a TV series cut together than movie for cinemas. And don't forget the harm the movie made for movie industry.

Why does this movie have such a relatively low rating on the IMDb? The record for most Academy Awards (OScars) won by a single movie is eleven. This was only won by three movies, ever: Ben-Hur, The Lord Of the Rings: Return of the King, and Titanic. Out of those Titanic was also nominated for the most (fourteen including its wins.) LOTR:ROTK is in the top ten on the Top 250, and i know Ben-Hur is on there somewhere. If the overwhelming number of Oscar wins and nominations don't tell you enough, here' what I think: Titanic is one of the best movies i've seen. The sub-plots all tie together perfectly, the chemistry between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio is amazing. The acting is brilliant, and the special effects are very well-done. Forgive the expression, but i laughed, i cried, and i died a little inside along with Jack. To see this movie is to see greatness. James Cameron proves that he can do non-action movies and still be a great director. 10/10.",Titanic

But why did Rose pick Jack ? That is a question that I have asked a LOT of people and nobody can tell me what I am looking for so could someone tell me ?

There is a reason why Titanic has nearly double the takings of the other movies. It isn't SFX, it isn't Leo: there are other movies with Leo and other movies with SFX. For years until 1997, any movie taking the box office all-time crown pushed out a little bit. Titanic blasted the other movies apart. The reason Titanic is no 1 is because it is a great film. Of course it has flaws, like any other movie, but when you take $1.8 billion you must have got almost everything right.Everyone thought that Harry Potter would knock Titanic off no 1. It didn't even get close. HP had a huge established following and great special effects... but the film was rubbish. It will take a truly great film with mass appeal and visually beautiful to ever dethrone Titanic: either that, or wait until inflation does the job.So go and put your Leo-jealousy away (after all, his career has hardly been that good since Titanic: only Catch me if you Can has had been any good)and watch this film again.

First of all, Leonardo Can't act to save his life.  What was the official word at the casting call?  ""Must be able to stand in front of the camera and bring in teenage women""?  And Kate Winslet, who I have respected in the past, completely lost her abilities as well.  You wait two hours for anything to happen, and when it does, it happens so slowly that I hardly even noticed.  As for the special Effects, I've seen better Special Effects in movies with MUCH smaller budgets.  Want to know what the best part of the movie was?  When I went to go see it, right before the end credits, the film melted and the projector caught on fire.  I was quite happy to realise that a copy had been partially destroyed.  This is a terrible excuse for a film.  How can you not agree when the machinery showing it commits suicide??",Titanic

I did not care about any of the passengers James Cameron took the time to introduce us to.  In fact, we know none of the true heart-breaking tales of the R.M.S. Titanic - only the fanciful romantic tale of a spoiled brat and the only American in steerage. It is frightening to me that America embraced this movie without ever learning one bit of true history about the disaster of the Titanic.  5 will get you 10 that most of America believes there was such a jewel as the Heart of the Ocean.  We already know many fools clamored around the graves of anyone known as Jack Dawson.  Most offensive, however, are Mr. Cameron's comments at the Oscars without any regard for the 1523 lives actually lost on the R.M.S. Titanic.  Life is not a movie, and love does not conquer all.",Titanic
1130,Giac-3,"This, in itself, is a reason never to trust the Oscars.",1,16 October 1999,"It is appalling that James Cameron hitched his disaster movie to the late-1990s fascination with the R.M.S. Titanic.  He can now lump himself with other filmmakers such as Oliver Stone who distort history in an effort to make a film about something other than the historical event they end up teaching the American public about.  But, even setting aside my disdain for his gross inaccuracies in Titanic history, and going with my deepest feelings that films are for enjoyment and escapism, this movie lacked the most important part of any film developing characters: I didn't care about Rose or Jack.  Rose was spoiled.  Jack was a foolish brat.  This film also contained the fatal flaw in triangle love stories: I liked the bad guy. Billy Zane, beauty aside, was still the only character who probably was on the Titanic, and the only one I hoped made it off the ship alive.  It is better to see the film that should have won the Oscar that year (LA CONFIDENTIAL) rather than waste anymore time even reading more comments about the movie that did win the Oscar.",Titanic
1131,goregod,You probably like Scream too,1,26 February 1999,"The Greatest film of all time? HMMM.I vowed to never watch the film, but I did. What a waste of time and 2 video cassettes. I did give the film a chance. I am a James Cameron fan, I own all of his other films on cassette. What can I say. The film was boring, the acting was horrible. DiCaprio was laughingly bad, and he actually thought he deserved an Oscar nod. Billy Zane played the best character in the film, honestly. His character was the most entertaining character.Too bad so many people were blinded by DiCaprio's looks and did see the bad acting flowing from him. The special effects were poor. C'mon, long black bars representing the night sky. Mushy looking computer generated faces put over stunt peoples faces to make them look like DiCaprio and Winslet. There is no way that DiCaprio could swim up to the surface of the water after being pulled in by such a huge undertow. The special effects guys forgot to add frozen breath in many of the sequences that take place in the frigid water. Also during that scene you can here soundstage echos. DiCaprio sure spent a lot of time talking about places he had been to, which is fine, considering they did not exsist back then. Oh yea, It was sure nice of DiCaprio to turn his back on his apparent life long best bud for Winslet. What a nice guy. Look closely as Leo enters, the dining hall, you can see the reflection of a big camera and some crew guys carrying it. And if you adjust ticket prices for inflation, Titanic is not even close to being the highest-grossing film of all time. Gone With The Wind, E.T., and even The Star Wars Trilogy would have earned more. Too many Titanic fans brag about that. Kate Winslet did not need to be naked in that film. Also, her older version in the 90's could not have remembered all those facts about the ship. Bill Paxton was wasted in this film. This is not even close to being the greatest film of all time, It is not even a good movie.Check out Reservoir Dogs, The Star Wars Trilogy, Predator, even This Boys Life (A good DiCaprio film).",Titanic
1132,entity-4,why?,1,12 May 1999,"The same old love story, with mediocre acting and a bad script. Not even the bit of special affects or the detail Cameron gave can save it. I think that there is about 10 minutes that are worth watching.  Save your time for a better film",Titanic
1133,JJHH,Very dissapointing movie,3,23 September 1999,"This movie had it's themes backwards: the part about the Titanic itself was incredibly well done, and very suspenseful.  However, the love story was more predictable than the story of the ship.  It was the stock love story, which has been beaten to death over the years.  Leonardo Di Caprio gave an un-convincing performance which destroyed the movie even further.",Titanic
1134,wuharami,"Anti-DiCaprionism, anyone?",9,3 July 2000,"I think this was a great film. Truly an achievement in filmmaking. Superb technically, and in the story department it was above average. I think part of the fun of hating it is that people are annoyed by DiCaprio.  Okay, understandable, but come on, even he can't ruin an otherwise great movie that much!I know, I know, all those detractors say that the plot was simplistic and predictable, but, hey, simple stories are the best. It's not how convoluted the plot is, but how you tell the story. All stories basically boil down to boy meets girl, loses girl, gets girl, boy versus bad guy, and boy versus nature and various combinations of those. This story has all these elements, and though the characters weren't terribly deep, they were consistent. I really can't stand all these hip, modern movies that have these ""truly original characters"" that have nonsensical quirks, and get involved in contrived plot twists for no good reason. (think ""Swingers"". Plus, the visual aspects of the film were just masterful. I mean, did you notice the dissolves between the present and the past?
And let's not forget all the little details that Cameron put in, showing all the scenes with the minor characters, they really made you care for the at the end when the ship sank. you gotta admit, the sinking was intense.
**SPOILER**Lastly, the very end was the most emotional part, for me.  No, not when Jack dies.  I'm talking about when the old Rose goes to sleep, and the camera pans over all her photographs on the bureau. Seeing that really gave you a sense on how rich a life she led, and made the events on the Titanic that much more poignant.  It tied the past and the present together nicely, and you cried for her not because you're sad that she went through such a horrible disaster or that her lover died, but you kinda cry for joy because she survived and you know she lived life to the fullest, the way we all should. Not to sound cheesy or anything, but that is the most touching part of the movie to me. Anyway, I gave it a 9/10.One big peeve, though. I wished they stuck with an all-orchestral soundtrack didn't have that skinny bitch Celine sing on it.  But hey, that's capitalism, right?",Titanic

Dicaprio wasn't at his best either (watch Romeo and Juliet, Gilbert Grape or This boys life) and the biggest laugh of the movie was the dialogue, wich is rediculous in some scenes, hilarious in others. Looking back it was ok but not brilliant.",Titanic
1139,c.huddle-lamb,6 critical reasons why this was an excellent film,10,19 December 2001,"Less mystifying than the success of this film is the negative response it received from most critics. It has been labelled a spectacle of death, adolescent, banal, and (most damning of all) Hollywood. (Hollywood's become an adjective now, apparently.) At least five of my friends would not see it because Leonardo diCaprio is a teen idol, and they feel above associating with that kind of thing. The dialogue is pitched at a very general level - the last thing you'd call it is poetic. I think part of what rubbed so many critics the wrong way, is that this is a completely new approach to the Victorian romance. (I know, 1912 isn't precisely Victorian, but it's close, and as the 'Edwardian romance' isn't really a genre, that's what people will be comparing this with.) Room With A View this ain't. It is, however, reminiscent in many respects with Thomas Hardy's novels. Here are some of it's features:
Technically, Titanic is really cutting edge. High quality special FX (though a few problems rendering the CGI passengers). It's good enough to double as a documentary. The characters are fictional, but really, is anyone dumb enough not to realise that? There's real footage of the real Titanic at the bottom of the ocean, really tricky stuff involving shooting underwater, and a strong knowledge and portrayal of the mechanical workings of the ship. It won the Special FX Oscar for good reason.It's the first special FX romance. Sure there have been FX movies with romances in them, but only as an accompaniment to the testosterone pumping hero. Titanic makes the statement (perhaps inadvertently) that technology can be relevant to a woman's story as well. (More recently, we've seen Charlie's Angels, and I think we'll see more in the future - but Titanic was the first, as well as the only one that's really a 'chick-flick'). This doesn't necessarily make Titanic a good film, but it is a point of interest.It's complex, yet logically consistent. When a plot works as smoothly as in Titanic, it's easy to overlook how clever it is. There are a lot of characters, but we never get confused. Every character is logically consistent. Every scene, every visual, every word moves the story forward. This film not only uses the classic 'Hero's Journey', it uses it for four subjects simultaneously: Rose (the heroine, played by Kate Winslet), the ship, the archaeologist, and the diamond. Each of these subjects has a story that stands alone. Rose and the ship are inextricably linked, and their stories parallel almost exactly. A lot of Rose's internal dialogue could be applied to the ship without changing a word, and their social roles are very similar. It's a clever technique that makes us relate to the ship's fate by identifying with Rose, and vice versa. Likewise, the archaeologist allows us to bridge the gap from our 20th century cynicism into Rose's story. The film doesn't expect us to care about this ship straight away, it works to persuade us, and the audience's 'journey' is mirrored in that of the archaeologist. (By the way, if you think this doesn't sound very hard, go ahead and try it, sucker.)I mentioned Thomas Hardy earlier. James Cameron has Hardy's eye for real-world detail, and a way of realising its significance. More particularly, they both have a lot to say about women, the industrial revolution, British Imperialism, and class - and they seem to arrive at the same conclusions. The dialogue concentrates on being true-to-life rather than poetic - right down to accents, turn-of-phrase, and foreign words being subtitled (where necessary, which isn't often). This is also true of gestures, costumes, technology, music, art, and other cultural particularities. A great deal of thought and research has been expended. All this to give us a film that creates more than characters and a story, it's a film that recreates a world.Awesome recognition of theme, metaphor, and myth. Personally, this is the aspect of Titanic that really blows me away. James Cameron not only recognised a good story here, but he figures out why it's important, and translates that onto the screen. The first, and most obvious point, is that the ship becomes a microcosm of British society. Graphically and spatially people are divided according to telling social conventions - cf first and third class accomodation. Cf the position and costumes of women and men. And because he's working from a true story, Cameron makes his point without being tokenistic. It embodies a Christian tri-partite world, with the hellish boiler chambers below, and the almost heavenly freedom on the decks above. The Captain and crew sit on high and order how everything will be run. The machinery (representing the industrial revolution) is awesome, remarkable, but ultimately fails when it becomes an end in and of itself. It is a classic tragedy that tells of human ambition, power, and pride. It is a Romeo & Juliet tale of the love that crosses all boundaries. It incorporates Icarus and metaphorical fairy godmothers. It's the ship of fools, the journey from the Old World to the New, and Man against Nature (and the gendered nature of the concept is explored). But it does all this with a particularity of circumstance that takes these themes/myths/ideas, and reinvents them. Then it turns up the pressure - first by bottling these people onto a large (but still conspicuously finite ship); then, as the ship sinks, taking that room and making it smaller and smaller. People are forced to make choices. Push comes to shove. And the good, the bad, and very ugly side of human nature is disturbingly brought to life.Finally, Titanic has an emphasis on communication. It takes a vast amount of complex information and communicates it clearly and succinctly. It is the kind of layered film that anyone can watch and understand, but the more you look into it, the more you find. It's very visual - in such a way that you could turn the sound down and you'd get all the important details. It shows, it doesn't tell. Despite the technical wizardry producing it required, and the huge numbers of people to co-ordinate, the film looks unified and never falters in its pacing, themes, or story. It remains masterfully under the director's control, and it lives and breathes his enthusiasm.",Titanic
1140,fmorrison,Was Cameron possessed by David O. Selznick?,7,3 July 2002,"""Titanic"" and ""Gone With the Wind"" have much in common:  both were enormous, sprawling, troubled productions, and both dealt with actual historical events. But their place in history is based more on their pop-culture influence than on their presentation of these events. They both have some extraordinarily beautiful sequences, yet both are hampered by clunky dialogue and some painfully inept performances. (Billy Zane would have looked right at home in a dinner theater production with all of his histrionics). And it has been well documented that their creators (in the case of ""GWTW"", that would be producer Selznick, not any of the five or more directors) were obssessed with their respective creations. And certainly, each consumed tremendous amounts of money, though their earnings seemed to justify the expenditures. But it begs the question-what is the morality of spending so much (""Titanic""-$200M) when there is so much actual need in the world? Oh well, at least ""Titanic"" didn't have those god-awful ""southern"" accents like ""GWTW"". News flash to Hollywood-nobody in the known universe talks that way.",Titanic

Anyone who doesn't think this film is great, then lock your selves in a dark room, and watch Titanic on your own, and without interuptions. IT IS THE BEST FILM EVER MADE.

It is a great film to watch alone, or with friends/loved ones etc. SEEING THIS FILM FOR THE FIRST TIME IS THE BEST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.

I don;t want to be rude or anything, but it was just so horribly written that I couldn't anything in it seriously. Including the sinking, and I might have bin laughing. Don't take me for a nasty person, it's James Cameron's fault. One part that really annoyed me was the fact that Cameron tried to makes us cry and be dramatic by sticking a dead baby in the water. It made me say, ""What are you trying to do James?"". I mean, he was purposely trying to be dramatic and when you do that, it fails. It failed for me. It was just a dumb thing to do and I really thought it was a horrible movie. If you think the screenplay in this movie was good, then you really need a doctor.",Titanic
1159,john-hitchcock,An Incredible Cinematic Masterpiece,10,7 September 2010,"Ever since I saw Avatar, I began to develop a strong respect for James Cameron, so when I found out he was the genius behind the cinematic legend that is ""Titanic"", I got excited.The film is really well written. I love the way it is told in flashback.It begins with a group of present-day treasure hunters exploring the wreckage of the Titanic (which results in some brilliant underwater footage). They find an old safe that's completely empty save for a drawing of a woman. An elderly woman suddenly phones them and says she's the woman in the picture. She then tells the divers and her granddaughter the main plot of the film.One thing that I really like as well about the flashback format is the editing. Each time the film always shifts between the past or present via a match cut, such as a video of the wreckage of the Titanic in the present day changing into the Titanic before it left in 1912 or a close-up shot of ýoung Rose's eye to the eye of the elderly Rose in the present.The characters are all really well developed. I love how the film manages to blend some of the real historical figures (I.E. the crew of the Titanic) with fictional characters (I.E. Rose, Jack) and yet it is still incredibly believable, as if this really was a true story. The story is largely focused on the relationship between Rose and Jack, but the film constantly manages to develop other characters. Even the present-day characters are really well developed.The story is very well written, and I love the way how it changes in tone throughout. The film starts off exciting, with many people excited, yet still manages to portray Rose in a somewhat sympathetic role. A large portion of it is the romance between Jack and Rose, but the film manages to have some dramatic scenes, with a large sub-plot of the story being the conflict between Rose and the rest of her upper-class family. The film even manages to include a bit of humour here and there, but doesn't take it too far. However everything changes near the end, when we have the iceberg, and all of a sudden the film becomes very dark and tragic.The climax is very impressive. It takes place once the Titanic hits the iceberg. At this point, the film manages to successfully shift focus between different people. It manages to focus on the protagonists, but also manages to focus on the chaos and tension as the ship sinks and the crew struggle to keep order and get the passengers off safely. It brilliantly manages to capture the tragedy and horror of the disaster.Overall this movie is a cinematic masterpiece and one that you definitely should see if you haven't already.",Titanic

The opening framing device was totally unnecessary and felt sooooo long, while adding nothing to our understanding, nor even piqueing our interest (wasn't that supposed to be the intention?).Then the cast of stereotypes! Awful, and all saddled with flat, uninspired dialogue or worse still, retrospective smart-alec bits (""Picasso? He won't amount to much"", ""Freud? Who is he? Is he one of the passengers?"" .....groan). The fatal casting of Leonardo di Caprio, still in his baby face mode as a well travelled man of the arts (???), while Kate Winslett, mature and a little blowsy (nothing wrong with that) appears almost old enough to be his mother, is a serious misjudgement. Her fiancé (a luckless Billy Zane) lacked only a moustache that he could fiendishly twist in his most unctuous moments. A total pantomime creation (the villain in Avatar was a similar one dimensional character). I saw the beginning on TV recently and watched again up until Kate is rescued from leaping off the stern. I hoped that I might be able to reassess it. No chance. It got me just as annoyed as the first time, the improbabilities just as ludicrous (would the crew REALLY have allowed Leo and chum to the bow to yell ""King of the world""?). The only reason this got two stars was for the technical sequences during the sinking, but as for the fate of the protagonists, by that stage I was past caring.

The fact that James Cameron was willing to create a huge ship all because he was that committed to this film and he exceeded with fireworks. Jack and Rose, they are the epiphany of what we call true love. No couple from any movie has shown us such love, passion, and will to risk anything, just to see their faces one more time. Rose, played the Kate Winslet who is basically a woman who doesn't approve of her mother's choice to marry because her husband died and no money is around, so Rose is forced to marry Kal. Kal a conceited man who thinks nothing of the poor and or third class. He's the type where he thinks he's God's gift to the world. What a lousy gift!Jack, Leonardo DiCaprio, is the person who fly's at the seat of life. His life completely changes all in a card shuffle. But he never thought of meeting a woman like Rose. As the film moves on, Rose and Jack meet at a very weird situation and soon trying to be torn apart by Kal, Rose's Mother, and Kal's man servant. Even as the ship sinks into the cold Atlantic, their love is still binded through the will to live. No matter what happens, their love will always be one.

These are the two best characters in the film.Two reasons to pour scorn on this film:1) The two main characters are so boring that I didn't care whether they lived or died. I had the same feeling watching An Affair To Remember. I don't know whether it was poor acting or poor characterisation, but if you are going to base an entire film on the relationship between two people, at least give them a little charisma and personality.2) Pretty much every character conforms to an exaggerated stereotype. From the rich, arrogant English to the poor, care-free, happy-go-lucky Americans, and the down-to-earth, fun-loving Irish (they always know how to have a good time don't they?) The stereotyping of every character was painful, right down to the brash, straight-talking American woman who sides with Di Caprio and is considered crass by the stuffy Brits. It is awful and unimaginative characterisation and story telling.All in all, Titanic is watchable but wouldn't get in my top 200 films.",Titanic
1165,boonhanlau,Flawless 10 out of 10,10,25 May 2013,"I gave it a 10 out of 10 because it deserves it. This legendary title came out when I was 1 year old. I didn't get to watch its premiere in the cinema, sad case. My parents have told me several times how good it was and my mom had watched it 3 times.When the 3D version came out, my family and I watched it together and it's really awesome. I could hardly believe they could make such a good film in 1990's. The special effects, the technology are just unbelievably good.On the other hand, the actors are real awesome. Leonardo Dicaprio, one of my favorite male actors. He did a marvelous job in the movie. He has such good acting at his age. He's the best actor in the film, imo.No matter how good the film is, don't watch it twice in a week... I went to watch it again with my friends and it's just too boring...seriously. I could clearly remember the whole story and what would happen next.So, overall. It's a must-watch film. I can't really understand why it's not in the IMDb top 250. It's unacceptable, seriously. It's a legend, man. I understand when there are lovers, there will be haters.This movie has a overall rating of 7.6 (at this moment), which is too low for a legendary film like this. Even some pure action film can get 8+ ratings nowadays.Watch it and you'll know what a 10/10 movie should be. One of the legendary movies.",Titanic
1166,little_miss_dolphin8,Inspiring,10,18 August 2006,"This movie is amazing. I love History and I love love stories so this movie makes for my favorite movie of all time. The suspense in the film is amazing, the detail incredible and the story-line is outstanding. I connect so well with Rose, I can understand everything about her and why she does everything. I can imagine me being Rose. I don't connect so well with Jack as a character, though that is probably because 1) Rose is the one telling the story and 2) Jack is a male and I am female. Kate Winslet is an awesome actress in this movie. She shows Rose so well and I can see the hopeful but clouded and misled young girl who is trapped into being a graceful, perfect woman so well. The depth of love between Jack and Rose is inspiring. This film reminds me a bit of Romeo and Juliet, where the two meet and quickly fall in love. I also love the way that James Cameron weaved so many facts about the event into the film. It would of been easy to turn this into a big, over-dramatic story where Jack becomes a hero and saves everyone on board by swimming the ship on his shoulders, or the ship explodes into a thousand pieces because of a wiring problem and everyone has to live on the ice-bergs or well, you get my drift. The point is that it doesn't. It sticks to the facts so well and I can imagine this story happening on Titanic. I can see this being a real story. And don't even get me started on the special effects. The attention to detail everywhere is enchanting. The way that the ship crumbles next to the ice-berg and how the water bursts into the compartment suddenly leaves you gasping.",Titanic
1167,Kyle007,Heart-touching experience,10,7 March 2005,"First of all i can't understand why this movie is rated with only a 6.9, it deserves much more, it is a superb movie and really underrated here.It is a movie that makes me cry every time i see it (and i've seen it lots of times) but i found it never wears out with the time.What can i say about the plot that could be new, absolutely nothing, i think everybody has seen this movie and everybody knows the plot. It really deeps into the times of the Titanic and shows us all the social classes, the unworried life of the low classes and the shallow and repetitive life of the high ones.Everything Rose wanted was to scape from that life that keeps people chained to the protocol. And it shows us how was the mentality of that times, it was all about the division of classes, aristocrat people only cared about having a luxurious life, not to be happy, only to show off and all that shallow stuff.It is quite impossible to say that story could happen in reality, because a high class lady would have never looked at a poor guy, but as for the movie it was something that you can really feel related to, and that's why you cry when Rose or Jack cries, or laugh, when they laugh.Well, and what can we say about the music? Simply wonderful, really sad in moments and that really helps the movie, Celine Dion did a great job singing ""My heart will go on"", and James Horner producing the music, one of the greatest of all time i have to say.And the special effects? Wow, if you didn't know that the ship was computer-generated you would think that the Titanic was rebuilt for this movie, i found no flaw in this.And wait, i'm forgetting something really important, the performances of Leonardo DiCaprio And Kate Winslet, they were nominated for the Academy Award and they should have won it, it was a job wonderfully done from them, and with total justice they became superstars.If i must resume this, i would say that nobody with a heart could say that movie didn't really touch them, it was really tender and sad and a masterpiece which has well-deserved the 11 Oscars it won. And if you live in some other place of the universe and you didn't watch it yet, go to your closest video store and rent it (or buy it) you won't be disappointed, despite all these cold-hearted who say it isn't a worthy movie of what has achieved, DON¨T LISTEN TO THEM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",Titanic

1169,BSideleau,Tepid and generic,3,2 May 2005,"OK, this is easily the most overrated film in history. Beyond the fancy CGI and epic scale is a generic love story, with poor charisma between the lead characters. Now, I'm not gonna Leonardo bash, he's actually a great actor and it's a shame this shitty movie put him in lame ""teen heartthrob"" status....cause he's got talent (just watch ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape""). But this film is typical James Cameron, as in it takes no risks and plays out with little to no surprises. I'm not saying he's a bad filmmaker, his kind of directing can have great results (Aliens, The Abyss, The Terminator) and not so great results (this film). I think he's better suited for action films than serious dramas, since he was basically the only person that could make a decent film starring the ridiculous ""Ahnuld"".",Titanic
1170,IndiePhlem,Mindless Whine Drivel.....,1,22 June 2005,"This movie has ABSOULUTLY nothing to do with the real Titanic. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and it made me cry thinking that I would never get my three hours back. I feel bad for wasting my time on this complete BORE of a film. It has too much romantic involvement,and the acting is awful. Compared to The Loin King (which was one of the BEST films I have had the pleasure of viewing) it would have kicked its sappy butt. Everyone likes that stupid love story? But what about those people who are SICK of hearing everyone yell, ""I'm king of the world!"" when really, you're just an idiot who got overpaid to die at the end. While so-and-so and whatshisface are running around making out with each other and drawing pictures in the nude, we wait and wait for a disaster to happen and finish off these two PATHEDIC excuses for characters. Then Celine Dion breaks through with the worst song ever, which makes you want to gouge your own eyes out and eat them. I danced around my living room after seeing whatshisface drown, which is the highlight of the entire crap-fest. In reality, this movie is for losers who have crap love lives who wish they could get on a ship and meet some guy who looks like Leonardo Dicaprio and enjoy bubble baths with Harliquin romance novels. If this movie was made today, it would bomb. Loin King (again, the best movie ever, I say this after watching them both-one after another) would've won the Oscar, and this would be what it is: A billion dollar waste. The members of the Academy must all be single mothers (who are on Prozac) and thirteen-year old girls, for this to win. All I can say is: America is a bunch of morons. This is the worst movie ever. DO NOT watch it, DO NOT waste your time and be like these people who love this movie. Pre-pubescent idiots. James Cameron ripped me off. Only because I liked Jerry McGuire. YOU RIPPED ME OFF, JAMES! I'M COMING FOR YOUR HIDE! Twenty burnt popcorns out of ten good ones.Notes: -""I'll never let go Jack."" Opsie Daisy. I let go.-I like that part where Rose is trying to kill herself. I wish Jack would've minded his own business.....-The sex scene sucks.-In reality, the upper class and the poverty stricken youth would not have ever met, much less have a love story.-Aw. She changed her name at the end. THAT'S THE BEST YOU CAN DO!?! -I remember being seven and hating this.-Any movie that has two video cassettes will suck.

1172,montysmith-slp,"Definition of hubris: ""King of the world!""",4,7 November 2005,"The sinking of the Titanic is an enduring story of 20th-century man's arrogance in an age of speed and comfort. The maiden voyage of the world's largest, most luxurious ship had a grim date with destiny on the night of April 14th 1912. There have been many more catastrophic disasters since but few with the haunting resonance of the Titanic's tragic fate. For complex social and political reasons, the story of the Titanic is a shared experience of human folly and heroism. James Cameron's hyped up extravaganza chooses to ignore the significance of the event, opting simply to tell a trite love story that ends in the water. It is in no way a fitting memorial to the 1537 souls lost at sea in the early hours of April 15th. Worse, it is a travesty. The American ship Californian was less than 10 miles away yet ignored the Titanic's distress flares. This integral component in the unfolding disaster is not merely skimped by Cameron, it is totally ignored. Why? By focusing solely on the insipid Romeo and Juliet romance between Leonardi DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, Cameron diminishes the tragedy's devastating scale. ""Size matters,"" claims Cameron, missing the point  he merely replicates the hubris of Edwardian thinking on the 'unsinkable' ship. His sense of size relates only to his huge sets and the amount of screen time allotted to his twittering lovebirds. Cameron has made a Titanic for the dumbed-down MTV generation. His bloated romance lacks the humility and simple grace of the moving British film on the same subject, A Night To Remember. Titanic is more like another 1958 film, An Affair To Remember  soggy, ponderous and clichéd to the core: the steerage passengers are salt-of-the-earth types happily dancing drunkenly to Irish reels; the aristocrats are pompous, stuffed-shirt repressives; the crew is a collection of doughty Brit caricatures. Even so, most of them are more interesting than the limpid lovers sketched by DiCaprio and Winslet. He quotes Bob Dylan lyrics. She flips the finger to David Warner. In 1912. But the film's failure as drama rests not with them. The director falters from the outset, airlifting an improbably sprightly 102-year-old survivor on to an Atlantic salvage ship. And history isn't big enough for Cameron  in a laughably melodramatic lapse he has Billy Zane chasing the loving couple through the flooding ship, firing off shots. As for the heralded special effects, they are not always convincing and, in one awful crane shot swooping from bow to stern, clearly the work of computer imagery. James Cameron, the writer-director behind such soulless Hollywood product as Terminator 2 and True Lies, was never going to be the right man to tell the great story of the Titanic.",Titanic
1173,pauldaguirre,Definitely not A NIGHT TO REMEMBER,1,15 March 2019,"The most egregious aspect of this overblown cinematic vessel is not the cloying Dick and Jane script, the vulgar modern-day prologue, the primitive CGI effects (painfully obvious on the big screen even in 1997), the fact that DiCaprio looks like a thirteen year old who hasn't yet reached puberty, or the unfathomable eleven Oscars it snared.No. The true crime here is that the perfect movie about the sinking of the Titanic had been fashioned four decades earlier in A NIGHT TO REMEMBER, which managed to break your heart with the genuine passenger list in its genuine predicament. The tragedy of the sinking, and the core of the 1958 film, is the arrogance of the masters of industry who propelled the Industrial Revolution. This was history. There was no need for a fictional plot, no blue diamond, no Celine Dion, no cartoon villains with twirling mustaches, no Frances Fisher spinning the same holier-than-thou act she's still doing on the Hallmark Channel, and no $250 million budget.Watch A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.

1174,broaded,James Cameron is a HACK and aTitanic is easily the most OVERRATED film of all time and that's a FACT!,1,5 April 2018,"Titanic is definitely by far the most OVERRATED motion picture of all time, filled with two idiotic and selfish lead characters that overlooks to true tragedy of the sinking of the great ocean liner.While the sinking of the Titanic is somewhat impressive, it's filled with James Cameron and his usual bad screenwriting. Cameron has often said he hates screenwriting and his awful scripts for True Lies, Titanic and Avatar all prove it, his dialogue is atrocious, I mean if I hear ""I'm the king of the world"" again I want to vomit and using his same line at the Oscars is a new low for how selfish Cameron is with his inflated ego.Jack and Rose are two of the most annoying characters to ever be seen on the big screen, when the boat finally sinks (after watching over two hours of endless boredom) the film finally has a pulse, but suffering with the two lead characters and their immaturity and selfishness really brings the film down to mediocre,, even awful levels.James Cameron is a HACK, he has no original ideas, he steals ideas from others (such as Terminator was really based on an episode of The Outer Limits, Aliens was a sequel to a far superior original film, True Lies was originally a French action spy comedy, Titanic was really Romeo and Juliet aboard the doomed ocean liner, and Avatar was nothing more than a science fiction version of Dances With Wolves, mixed with the 1'992 animated feature FernGully.All in all Cameron is an egotistical maniac, who often clashes with his actors and crews and makes mediocre films at best, and that is a solid FACT!",Titanic

Second thing is its not romantic, it is over any limits and really not touching at all. Another thing is the music I hate, awful really, I believe Canadians have many better things... We watched it with a friend and the only moment we liked was really when Leonardo dived never to appear again. If you watch only this movie you will hate him, but I give him the credit for other movies. As one here said I love to hate it, yes and most of the people I know hate it.

DeCaprio, from a purely unbiased mans view I can see the appeal to the more uncritical female section of the audience, however he was totally acted off the screen by the glorious Kate Winslet. This is not the first time consistently he is given parts that most actors would kill for only to find himself completely upstaged by much better actors, remember Mercutio in Romeo and Juliet, Daniel Day Lewis in that abomination Gangs of New York. I rest my case. The soundtrack by Celine Dion left me with the urge to scream with tedium, good voice shame about the material! The film is over long and I can not see the necessity for the length the plot certainly didn't present any challenges or surprises. The Titanic disaster in reality was about people and peoples responses differed to the in relation to it, it was not only the rich who were cowardly and oppressive in reality there was a lot of bravery shown as well, in other words HUMANITY at its best and worst. I found the Hollywood gross oversimplification at best insulting at worst the stereotype portrayed about the Irish deeply insulting and approaching racist. In summation I would say that the experience was something similar to visiting a slightly dementing older relative and being left alone in their company for a day. The relationship between DiCaprio and The glorious Winslet (OK I'm Biased) could not carry the entire film especially given its length. I ended up praying for the iceberg and virtually cheering when DiCaprio sank without a trace. Somewhere there is a more over rated film but for the moment it escapes me.",Titanic

James Cameron is a superb director with focus and determination that no one can match. Leonardo Dicaprio brings Hollywood glamour without taking any focus from Kate Winslet who shines through. The chemistry between the two is powerful and as a viewer you are sucked in to their world and you really feel for them as a couple and as individuals. the movie is packed full of special effects and credit must also be given to the supporting actors such as Billy Zane as Cal and the wonderful Kathy Bates as Molly Brown. The action scenes are extremely powerful and the love scenes are so moving they reduce a grown man to tears.The whole movie is captivating, Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio bring a sense of class to the movie, while James Cameron brings experience. You can tell James Cameron has done his homework on the Titanics history as every little detail has been inserted in to the film. Probably the most detail was put in to the dining room in the upper class suites.This movie is a most have for any movie goer and has to be in everybody's collection.

The people in Titanic were portrayed so realistically, unlike other movies.  In Titanic, you could actually feel what was going on inside the people's minds and hearts.

1188,Raptor24,Even George Lucas says Titanic would still stay at number one!,10,23 May 1999,"Titanic was one of those films that people as a whole, embraced and took it to their hearts.  Though there may be inaccuracies in this film, (and which films out there really do not), that's besides the point.  Titanic was created by this great storyteller named James Cameron, who incorporated a fictional love story and wove it in the actual moments of the Titanic from its initial departure to its inevitable sinking. Knowing a good story when they see one, people literally came in droves to see such a masterpiece as this film was.  If you are one of the few people in the world that missed this film, either try to catch it a local 2nd-run movie theatre (the choice of medium), or rent the Widescreen version of it.Note:  Early in 1999, there was talk that that prequel to Star Wars: Episode 4, A New Hope, would destroy box office numbers, and dethrone Titanic to be the all-time champion of all films.  Personally, I dismissed these claims that this would happen.Titanic was a movie phenomenon, while Star Wars: Episode One, will stay a marketing phenomenon, with its true success in merchandise sales.  Titanic will be remembered as the film of the 1990's, not the first Star Wars prequel.  I say to the naysayers who said Titanic would be toppled in the box office by Star Wars I, that you all will turn out to be saddened to find out that this will never come to happen.  While George Lucas himself says that the Phantom Menace would be fourth on the list of films with the highest box-office receipts, I say that this Star Wars film will end up in fifth or sixth place.Where Titanic would be on my top ten favourites list:1.(tie) Braveheart, Glory, & Titanic  4.

What's next, LOVE OVER LOCKERBIE SCOTLAND or perhaps HINDENBURG, THE LOVE STORY. The screenplay reads like a Sidney Sheldon novel, alternating between syrup and sap- while, oh by the way, lots of people are dying. TITANIC is the most overappreciated bunch of schlocky dreck to hit the screen since GONE WITH THE WIND. It's an all-out attack on the emotions by a hack director (albeit a big-budget hack director). It could have been so much more, maybe even a study of the horror that must have been that fateful night. A true talent could have given us multi-dimensional characters and- if the love story angle must persist- could have actually made the love triangle interesting or, God forbid, UNIQUE! Instead, we have the tired film cliche of the nice girl engaged (against her will) to an unspeakably unscrupulous, wealthy and unbearable man when along comes- aawww- a kind hearted, but down on his luck artist. Was anything original about this tribute to movie special effects and technical innovation? NO! It's more of the same James Cameron junk we've seen time and time and time again- explosions one-dimensional characters spewing forth ridiculously saccharine dialogue while the music tells us how to feel.

Beginning: good, established the ""characters"" nicely, set a decent pace.  It's all downhill from there, folks!  Leonardo DiCaprio's performance could only be described as a poor imitation of a twelve year old doing a poor imitation of Clark Gable (he should at least be happy that I said they're names in the same sentence), and Kate Winslet was either too subdued or, well, way too subdued.  Don't get me wrong, the beautiful costumes and lavvish sets were awe-inspiring. I do admire James Cameron's attention to detail.  I also admire James Cameron's ability to direct an exciting action/adventure film, and therein lies the heart of the problem: this is not an action /adventure film. When the boat was sinking it played more like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Hypothermia than a tragedy of epic proportions, and the fact that the two leads didn't seem scared during the whole ordeal didn't help matters much.

The characters in general were shallow and one-dimensional;  none of the main characters were in the slightest bit likeable, and the film's potential was ruined by the extremely silly and totally fabricated central story of the ""upstairs/downstairs"" romance between Di Caprio and Winslett.  This totally implausible bit of the plot succeeds in turning this tale of a terrible human tragedy into just another trite Hollywoodisation in which only beautiful people and thwarted love count for much.  Such a shame - given the dreadful, tragic setting (which, let's face it, really did happen), it could have been a good film.......",Titanic

I sat through the whole movie wondering if I'd have been better off staying home and doing laundry, and I've come to the conclusion, that yes, I probably would have been.This movie is recycled cr*p.  They took the classic ""Rich girl loves poor boy"" story, tagged on one of the world's largest tragic events, stuck in a pretty face or two (forget about acting ability -- Kate dear, you were better in Sense and Sensibility), ten bazillion dollars for a budget and bingo, you've got yourself a blockbuster that attracts hoards of lip glossed, hip huggered, chunky heeled, Britney Spears listening, glitter wearing teenaged girls.  All for the sake of a pre-pubescent Leonardo DiCaprio (c'mon! He looks like he's twelve). It saddens me that something as shallow as a teen heart throb can elevate a piece of junk like Titanic to what some call the best movie of all time. Argh!The only part of this movie that actually made me stop and look were the beautiful CGI effects. However prettiness and expensive effects doth not a good movie make.  Other than that, spitting off a ship and contrived chases with guns do not appeal to me much as good cinema.  I'd recommend everyone to see it at least once, but not for the sake of seeing a good movie, but to remind society that we're too used to being served 2 for $1 cans of tuna that were prepared for the cost of caviar.

1196,jessx2001,Imperfect Yet Truly Emotional Epic,9,16 October 2000,"I can see how a lot of guys would not want to watch this movie. I took my stepmother(who does not understand english)to watch Godzilla and she fell asleep through the movie. I took her to see TITANIC and she stayed awake throughout the three hours and twenty minutes. That says a lot to me.After watching this movie, I realize how imperfect it is. Some of the dialogue is unrealistic. Did they really say ""damn!!"" and ""cop"" back in those days??? It is almost a shame to see Cameron pay attention to so many details in this movie and miss that.However, that mistake is a small price to pay for what he really accomplished with this movie: the realistic sinking of the ship and the devastating human loss as a result. For people who went to see this movie JUST to see the ship sinking, you missed the point just as Brock Lovett missed the point: ""I never got it; I never let it in."" Innocent human lives were lost because of human arrogance and dependence on man-made machines.Let me stray just a bit. I recently saw a 20/20 show on people buying their way down into the ocean to visit the titanic. I could only shake my head and remember something I heard James Cameron say: Isn't it ironic how people are willing to pay to go into a tiny submarine two and half miles down into the ocean in total darkness-- to have to depend on a man-made machine to withstand all that pressure down there- to keep them alive--- JUST so they could visit the very exact symbol of technological disaster??!!!! How ironic. LEAVE THOSE PEOPLE IN PEACE!!! and go back home and appreciate your loved ones.As ""boring"" as Jack and Rose might have been to very many people     , they served a very important purpose. They served as our emotional template. It is because of them that we are able to identify hope, despair and finally lost. It is not only their struggle we sympathize with but everyone else on the ship as well, especially the innocent victims.Every movie can be very different depending on the director. Cameron does a great job because he filmed this as an epic. We have old Rose as our narrator so that we are on solid ground in present time. She takes us to the past so that we can feel as much as is possible how those people must have felt facing the last couple of hours of their lives. The transitions between the different times are effortless and moving.

To those who accuse people who rate Titanic low of not rating this movie ""honestly"" I question whether you have rated this movie honestly.

I said it was ""The Notebook,"" and they all said, ""No, it's Titanic!"" I'd never seen Titanic, I never had gotten around to it and it seemed slightly boring. So I sat down and watched it with my sister when it was on the TV. There were laughs in it, but I'm not such a fan for tearjerkers such as this one.The score was very good, there were beautiful pieces of music throughout. I normally love tearjerkers, but this one was just too much for me. *spoilers* of course I knew what was going to happen, it's practically general knowledge! When Jack died in the water, I was too overwhelmed and I became stressed. Later on, the same scene running through my mind, I threw up and had a brief panic attack. I wasn't over reacting, but it was much too overwhelming for me, even though I'm not that much of a sensitive person.I still respect everyone else's opinions, such as 'It's an epic movie of our millennium,' etc. But it was an extremely emotional film and I'll never be able to watch it again, because it did affect me too much, seeing as one of my much older relatives, died on the Titanic. To watch it again, for some people, it can even be upsettingly painful. But you do like epic, tragic love stories, this is definitely the one to see.",Titanic

If you strip all the attention surrounding this movie away, you're left with a big-budget film that is just that - big-budget.  The film overwhelms itself with a ridiculous amount of foreshadowing.  The acting is nothing to be accoladed.  I wasn't even impressed with the magnificent Kathy Bates' performance.  The costumes, special effects, and soundtrack were all good points in the film, however I do not like the fact that the Academy awarded this film so heavily.  It was simply an overhyped epic, not a film worthy of 11 of Hollywood's most prestigious award.  James Cameron's ego-driven direction really spoils this movie.  I would recommend seeing this movie just because it IS the tragedy of the century, but don't fall into the trap of thinking this is a quality piece of filmmaking.  I voted 5/10.",Titanic
1204,dominodancing,"""Smell ice can ya... bleeding Christ!""",8,27 August 2001,"'Titanic' is OK. It is the sort of film that really satisfies when it is first seen, especially in the cinemas. However when you watch it again, or think about it, the flaws are all too clear.The script is the main problem. Some of the lines are absolute stinkers (for British viewers, the two 'cockneys' in the crows nest are dreadful... to all Americans out there, no-one in Britain says ""bleeding Christ"") and the acting could have been a bit better. There was not much chemistry between Di Caprio and Winslet and this makes the love story a bit on the unreal side.
However, the film is a winner on the technical front. Hard to believe that a director would be so keen to get a full size replica of the Titanic, but Cameron does and it looks impressive on screen. The effects are superb as well - except the iceberg which looks like a great big blancmange. So no argument about the technical oscars but come on, best picture! I don't think so. And Kathy Bates was awful. Still, 5/10. But Winslet, Di Caprio and Cameron will all do better than this.",Titanic
1205,Shay17,"A beautiful, horrifying masterpiece",9,23 August 2020,"I have watched Titanic a number of times. The first being in the cinema in 1997, and the most recent last night (2020).It just never fails to move me in many ways. The disgust you feel at the egotistim and treatment of lower classes as well as the deeply engaging stories of those who were destined to be a part of history (in more ways than they ever bargained for), and the final abject terror watching the boat's demise makes this film a true rollercoaster of emotion.While the love story between Jack and Rose is fictional, and does take some 'Hollywood' artistic license, it adds a depth a richness to the story to allow you to empathise with many of the passengers on board. Watching it now, as a mother of young children, the Irish mother telling a fairytale to her two children as the ship is going down is infinitely heartbreaking in a way I didn't fully relate to the first time (I was 14). I think that is what makes this a timeless classic.The absolutely stunning cinematography of the ship's pride and beauty, intertwined with a great storyline full of interesting characters and a hauntingly beautiful soundtrack culminating in the ship's final dramatic and horrific hours still stands up 23 years later and always leaves me emotional and breathless. If you didn't know Titanic's true story, you'd be forgiven for thinking this was a far-fetched, over-egged Hollywood action film! For me, knowing it's a pretty close re-enactment of how the ship actually sank makes it all the more horrific to watch.I feel it would be easy for the next generations (particularly since the last survivor has passed on) to view the Titanic disaster as just another event in history, but I will encourage my children to watch this film not only because it's an enjoyable story, but to give them a true sense of empathy and compassion for the fellow humans that were part of the real version.",Titanic

I am not really a big James Cameron fan, I only like three of his works. But, ""Titanic"" is his masterpiece. He takes the tragedy of the ship and puts a love story spin on it. I like this aspect of it, especially when you know what the outcome of Titanic is. The viewer gets the happy feeling of Jack and Rose falling in love and the entire time you are wondering how things are going to turn out for these two. The way this movie is shot is nothing short of perfect. The destruction of the ship, the chaos that ensued and how the people felt both on and off the ship. It makes the viewer feel like they are there and can feel how the passengers felt. ""Titanic"" invokes every human emotion and that is really rare in movies today. James Cameron was able to do the impossible with this project and carried away 11 Oscars. Simply extraordinary. ""Titanic"" has been loved and enjoyed for nearly 15 years and will continue to be loved and enjoyed for many more.",Titanic

This has to be one of Kate Winslet's best films. When I first saw the movie I was grossed out by the love-making and stuff but it was really cute. The effects are so real. It's like going back in time. They are so authentic and I always wondered how they did it. The facts are actually accurate as I can say for some biographical movies I saw. When the Titanic sank it was so fascinating. I felt like I was actually on the boat screaming with all the other people. I was just in shock. The cast rocked and they did a great job. I will always watch this movie. It's romance mixed with drama and I love movies like this. This is by far the best movie I've seen. It's just outstanding and fascinating.,Titanic

It could have had at least an hour taken out of it with creative editing.2) The boat sinking. That scene did not need to be dragged out for so long. 3) The Celine Dion song.

I still LOVE the ""magical"" feeling I get when I watch this film.  I really felt like I was back in the early 1900's about to take a voyage on that infamous ship.  Very few movies can actually MAKE you feel like you're there...but Titanic did.  I still love the performances from DiCaprion, Winslet, Zane, and Bates.  I think they did amazing jobs given the sub-par script they had to work with.  EVen the ""lousy dialogue"" as people say didn't ruin this movie for me.  It MORE than made up for itself with costume, set design, historical accuracy and detail, and special fx.I think the MAIN reason why people bash this movie is because it WAS so good and LOVED by many people.  It didn't become the highest grossing movie of all time by people hating this movie! LOL*Also, the orchestra playing music on the deck is NOT a copy from Monty Python.  There's actual HISTORICAL truth to that.  It's a  FACT that the orchestra played that night on deck to ""calm"" the nerves of the rich upper crusty people.  One of the MAIN reasons why I love this movie is because Cameron really made you think about society and class EVEN in our days today.  The same thing goes on.  The people with $money$ make the rules and own the land so to speak.Also, I'm not so SURE Cameron WANTED the audience to INITIALLY feel sorry for the ""Rich"" upper class snobs.  I felt sadder for the lower class people. However, in the end, when ALL of of bodies are swimming and struggling to stay alive in the ocean...it didn't matter WHAT class ticket you held in your hand....you were most likely going to die if you drowned or froze to death in that water.  Now, it's true, MORE of the rich people survived, but hey...that's life.  It was still a tragic tragic event in history, and I don't know why people love to bash this movie.  Because it was so successful??   Most likely..Such a  good moral...",Titanic
1212,crystalc1020,"So what if it was ""cheesy""??",10,23 April 2003,"Hey, I'll take a cheesy but WELL done romance story anytime!  You see, that's what is so good about Hollywood.  Hollywood TRIES to make movies for everyone.  If Hollywood only made the same historical/factual/documentary type movies, that could get boring.  So, hollywood likes to spice things up a bit.  Sure the romance between Jack and Rose MAY have been unrealistic, but that doesn't mean it could NEVER have happened!  I've seen stranger things believe it or not.  Plus, we have to remember, that NO historical movie (not even the ""good ones"") are 100% factually accurate.  Sure, some are more accurate than others, but that's not necessarily the case in MOST movies.  Most movies add more drama or romantic stories in them to make things more interesting. How ""interesting"" would the 1997 version of ""Titanic"" had been if all you saw was the ship take off and then sink?? I LIKE to know the background stories of the people in the movie, even if it IS a ""sappy cheesy love story"".  Otherwise, it might be a bit boring. Who would even CARE about the characters if we didn't know at least a LITTLE about them?  And a tragic love story is the best formula.  Lovely!  James Cameron was smart...VERY smart to add this in this film. He has something for the men (action, special fx), and stuff for the ladies (some good-looking guys, and a love story).  There's nothing wrong with that. Sure, the dialogue wasn't ""OScar-caliber""...haha...yet it won 11 oscars out of 14!  A new record? Go figure!  Besides, it seems like MOST of the general public enjoyed the movie...so, who cares what the dialogue was like?I didn't see much wrong with Pearl Harbor except for the fact that the dialogue was VERY weak (10 times worse than Titanic ever was!), and it seemed to me like the main goal was to sort of RE-create another ""Titanicesque"" film to garner the same success Titanic had.  Not many movies can touch a WIDE ranging audience like Titanic did.  It might be some time before another movie does.  It's the highest grossing movie to date. Another one of Pearl Harbor's weaknesses (aside from the elementary plot and lines) was that I feel like perhaps maybe this historic event hit home to many Americans, and perhaps it was a little too ""close-to-home"" to make a shody job of a movie about Pearl Harbor.  Maybe in 30 years people wouldn't care if this movie had come out then, but there are still veterans still alive from the war, and although I'm not sure what MOST of them felt about the movie, from what I heard, a lot of them enjoyed it.",Titanic

Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it.  I personally enjoyed this film immensly, and still do!  I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many. As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol*  You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public.  PEOPLE make the film a huge success.  With Titanic, everyone was in awe.  Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before.  At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched!  Give this movie a break you guys!  The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time!  When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more!  So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"".  ha!  Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film.  However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more!  Personally, I LOVE this film.  However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though!  THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it!  The story was sweet.  The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship!

Well, I hate to break it to you, but I am a film lover who does like touching, beautiful dramas. I'm not some guy who sits around criticizing movies. But this is just disturbing. The message of this film is basically ""Americans can fall for soap-opera material that looks like a movie, and it can become the most overrated piece of trash of all time"". I mean seriously, it's just a really shallow and overly-touchy love story with really obnoxious tendencies to take itself waaayy to seriously. Honestly, James Cameron directed Terminator 2, which I thought was really fun and enjoyable because though it had a coherent story, it was purposely far-fetched and seemed to understand that. Titanic is three-and-a-half hours of pain-inducing mediocrity (except for the previously mentioned design), with completely over-the-top sappiness and the cheapest tricks in the book as far as getting a simple-minded audience to feel really tingly inside. And this won 11 Academy Awards? I've got a review for the only other movie to achieve this feat, Return of the King, which I didn't like either, but I've got to say it was better than this. My only question is, why, America? Why does crap like this become so acclaimed? I think the reason this won all those Oscars was its popularity. And why is it so popular? In conclusion, Titanic is a bad episode of Days of Our Lives with a little spicing-up of the visuals and a little more emotional manipulation. But it amounts to what should have been a little blip on the radar that everyone understood as mediocrity. Instead people consider this ""art"" and ""beautiful, powerful, compelling"". So the only productive thing this movie has really done is to show us that America has pretty low tastes in entertainment, and seems to think that it's somehow artistic.",Titanic
1217,xbabe82517,not entirely accurate but very moving,9,17 January 2003,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I know a lot of people see this movie as a joke but I absolutely loved it. Although it was my favourite movie for a long time but isn't anymore, it is still the only movie I've ever seen that has the ability to reduce me to tears every time. The music is beautiful and haunting - and possibly one of the best things about the movie - but the acting and romance is equally good. OK, so not ALL the acting is good but I definitely think Leonardo was the best actor. Kate was just as good - if you can set aside her dodgy American accent! Maybe the plot is predictable and cliched but there is just something special about this movie - and I'm sure many others will agree as well. There is a great chemistry between the two main leads and they are lovely to watch as their characters fall in love with each other. Billy Zane plays a convincing villain (though I'm not sure about his scary hairline!), and Frances Fisher is quite good as Rose's mother. However, one of my favourite characters was Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber) and I found it very sad when **SPOILER!!!** he says goodbye to Rose and you realise he's going to stay and go down with the ship. I found the ending heartbreaking and it took me a few days to stop thinking about it! I know there are many mistakes and historical inaccuracies but at the end of the day it was intended to be a romance first and foremost, and then a drama and an action movie. I have nothing against those who prefer A Night To Remember - and I know it's a lot more accurate - but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives in this movie. And as far as the mistakes go, any epic containing special effects is bound to have mistakes, and if you can move past the odd continuity shot and sun setting on the wrong side of the ship, you can appreciate the movie for what it is - a touching love story that does what it's supposed to do. 8/10",Titanic

The idea that Kate Winslett would have ever have met (let alone fallen in love with) DeCaprio aboard an Edwardian ship such as the Titanic is absurd. The fact that she then makes out with him in the back of a car aboard the ship just adds to the feeling that somebody at the studio has finally given up all hope of making a realistic story. It's overly long hollywood twaddle of the highest order, hopefully it will hit an iceberg and sink without trace soon!",Titanic
1220,habib_khodadad,Romance and tragedy conveyed masterfully,10,29 June 2018,"James Cameron's masterpiece, Titanic, is incontrovertibly the greatest anecdotal tale ever to grace the film industry. This movie has to be Cameron's masterpiece that has never been rivalled in its grandeur. This movie has a phenomenon ability to connect the audience on an emotional level, taking them on an emotional rollercoaster as the characters form bonds and face adversity from all flanks of life. This story juxtaposes the idea of love and power in different shades and angles. Leo and Kate have a relationship that is based on human emotions and desires for bonding, while Zane challenges that connection of human connection by flaunting his wealth and attempting to allure Kate with his affluence. This creates tension between the characters, and the story is very effective at controlling the crescendo so that the audience has an opportunity to connect emotionally with the characters that face this adversity. With Zane always prowling about throughout the movie, trying to win over Kate's heart with his money, there seems to always be a sombre feeling looming in the background as the events unfold between the main characters. This ominous sense of dread that is always suspended in the atmosphere seems to tie in well with the fact that the entire Titanic, the biggest commercial ship in the world, is also portend to face an unknown tragedy in the future. The director effectively seems to symbolize that human love between Kate and Leo as the impervious Titanic ship itself, and reveals the vulnerable side of it. This poetic depiction is demonstrated with so much gusto and romance, that one cannot help but fall in love as the inevitable tragedy dismantles that colossal giant known as love present in all human beings.",Titanic
1221,Tuck_Frump,Waste of time,3,3 January 2007,"I thought this movie was tremendously overrated. Considering the talent involved, it should have been a lot better. First of all, the movie went on way too long and although both great actors, DiCaprio and Winslett didn't match well together. In the kissing scenes I felt like I was watching a boy make out with his mother. I read somewhere that the Kate Winslett role was originally offered to Renee Zellweger, but that wouldn't have mattered because the entire movie was one big yawn. There were a few good scenes, but this movie should have only been an hour and a half to an hour and three quarters, not nearly three hours long. I also thought the lighting was really bad and the ship looked really fake in the water scenes. I am sure I am in the minority on this, but I would rather watch paint dry and listen to music than sit thought this entire movie again.",Titanic
1222,stephaniewuk,Excellent But In A Typically Hollywood Way,9,3 June 2006,"...the script is dire, the storyline obvious and the special effects not entirely convincing but there is something about this film that means I simply have to give it a good grade - I owe it to the 17-year-old girl I was when it was released who saw it four times at the cinema. I was addicted to it, as was my most cynical of friends. The combination of an already compelling story about one of the worst disasters in maritime history, attractive leads in Winslet and Di Caprio and a ashamedly gushy script means it assaults the emotions, captures the imagination and made it one of - if not the - biggest films in the history of cinema. A part of me does wonder if it was right to make a film about this, especially given James Cameron's egocentric obsession with it; my grandfather won't even watch it as he grew up in Ireland in the years following the catastrophe and it was very much mourned there. But the thing is that it was made and did its job very, very well. I bet you you know exactly what I mean!",Titanic

1224,Gladtobesaved6,Not bad but could've been better,6,20 March 2005,"On a metal table in the Virginian Pilot (a newspaper) distribution wharehouse at 3:30 AM, I saw my my first glimpse of what would become the best remembered film of 1997. The paper was running an article that April morning on what it's like to die by hypothermia and had a pic. from the film on the cover. Whether ""L.A. Confidential"" should've won best picture is a good question... All I knew was, I'd never seen any film that got so much hype in the months that followed.You all know the plot. You know the ship sinks. But this movie isn't as bad as some say, because while it does contain the most silly and overused love story imaginable, traces of sincerity can be found everywhere. James Cameron really DID care about the Titanic sinking. It shows because the film does decently give the viewer a sense of whats going on. That's incredibly important because the subject matter is so terribly serious (1 THOUSAND 5 HUNDRED Peoples' lives ending). I'd have liked it better if the film had been solely on the sinking and not even but mentioned Jack and Rose, but I'll take what I can get. Finally a year later a film came out that's sole purpose was to be historically accurate. It wasn't perfect, but at least ""Saving Private Ryan"" didn't ask me to cry for anyone's death's there was no celine dion song playing through the credits and James Ryan didn't end the film by leaving a medal or something at the grave site. It (SPR) put out there what it wanted to say and let me come up with the rest. Had Titanic been that same kind of film, I might own a copy of it now. Instead I rent it every other year or so. The really sad thing though is that after this film was made, no laws to prevent future spinoffs were passed. The result was ""Pearl Harbor"". SAD. TERRIBLY SAD.",Titanic

The first step to your recovery from watching this terrible film is to stop denying that it was a bad film. Now that we are done there, I can get to what was wrong with this pile of cinematic puke. The acting was bad, the dialog was bad, the plot was bad, the special effects were bad. So I ask you, what did James Cameron do right. His ""Amazing"" special effects were trumped by movies that came out ten years before hand. Come on, how good can a movie be when your headline actor is Leonardo DiCaprio? Honestly, just tell me what this guy did right. Here comes the spoiler that will save you rental money, and about three hours of agony, THE BOAT SINKS.

But there's zero chemistry - nudity and (God, how tacky!) fogged-up windows.Consequently, all the poor people are good!Thank you, Titanic, for simplifying the goodness or badness of any given individual simply by their financial statuses!I wanted everyone to die. It's the only way to justify the lost hours of my life that went into viewing this pathetic work of pseudo-art? Lifetimey ""based on true incidents"" crap.Really, don't bother. It's not a timeless classic; it's dumbed-down faux romance in the midst of tragedy drivel. Spend money on the script, not the special effects, for God's sake!

1227,nattylap2,lavishly mediocre,5,25 December 2005,"The story of the Titanic has been told many times on television documentaries, and almost all of them - especially Thomas Lord's 'A Night to Remember' - were better than this film.There must have been a sale on stereotypes in Hollywood, because the producers of 'Titanic' bought them all up by the bushel full. The people up in first class, with the exception of the one real life character portrayed in the movie, Molly Brown, were all fully stuffed shirts. They were so starched it is hard to believe they were able to bend over. On the other hand, those poor folks down in steerage - sailing to their doom - were just the salt of the earth. Happy-go-lucky, fun loving, free spirited. Some $200 million was supposedly spent on this movie. The special effects were indeed impressive. If they had only spent a little of that money on the screenplay, even including some intelligent dialog, think what a movie they could have had.",Titanic
1228,calmly_insane,It's The King of The World,10,15 May 2005,"This movie is the king of the world, and it is, it really is. People who bash this movie have no idea what they're doing. To start, yes there are a **FEW** bad parts, but even few may be a harsh word. In some parts, my attentions wanders, when the dialogue falls flat, but besides that...This movie deserves 12 stars out of 10. James Cameron is one of the best directors in the entire world. For doing Ghost of The Abyss, T 1 & 2, and many many more, New Line decided to give Cameron the budget of dreams. $200 million?! I mean, what is that? That's more then a lot of movies make for gross in North America! The effects in the movie are more then great. They're epic. When someones says the effects are bad, you want to slap them. You cannot get any more real then building the actual ship almost full size. One of the most haunting images of the movie is when the ship is about to break, and it's stern is right up in the air, and then the lights go out... the screams start.. and you here the groans. That gives me the chills just thinking about it.The music! The scoring in this movie is absolutely perfect. Before I get to The Song, I will say it's is very smart to have all classical music in this movie. The part at the end where the band plays, and the slow-mo starts, like the couple lying in bed, and the woman reading to her children. I cry every time. Celine Dion's song, My Heart Will Go On is a terrific song. Oh sure, you may bash it now, but you weren't doing that when we first heard it over 6 years ago. One major factor of why Titanic grossed over 1.8 billion worldwide is because of the song. Did y'all know the song was played around the world... 500 BILLION times? Yeah, so you can't exactly call it a terrible song can you? Acting. The talent that is very very tough to find these days. Choosing people like Kate Winslet and DiCaprio was probably extremely smart. They're wonderful in this movie. And yes, Kate's odd, and albeit fake accent may sound well, FAKE.. but that doesn't matter.Rarely has a 3 hour movie seen so short. It doesn't just sail, it steams ahead at 40 knots, with all the boilers lit, and with no iceberg in the way. I love this movie, and always will.",Titanic
1229,stdaganov,"And then she was dreaming, in the twilight of her life",10,3 October 2005,"""Titanic"", the second greatest movie of all times, is watched by nearly all the humans around the world (recently even by the Afghani people, as there was a premiere in Kabul after the fall of the Taliban), and is strongly loved or hated by enormous amounts of people. If you look at the comments and the vote rating on the IMDb, you will figure out that. Obviously there are a lot of people who think it is some kind of a banal romantic story, and as they are tough guys, they have voted negatively, bringing it from the second place that it deserves, to some regrettably low position, so it is not even in the first 250 TOP MOVIES on the IMDb.For the fact that it has earned more money than any other movie I will not speak - ""Star Wars"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"", and ""Harry Potter"", and ""Spiderman"" also earned comparable sums, and they are IDIOTIC. But on the ""romantic"" issue I have to speak a lot. And here I begin. No, you infinite idiots! It is not a movie about love! Love is a great thing, one of the greatest things humans have (tragically not all of them, not even half of them), but love is 10% of what the movie is about. Love is only a contributing factor here.This is a movie about the irreversibly lost things in life. It is a movie about memories and old age, and lost happiness. Not only it is about these things, but with all its contributing factors - the plot, the script, the music, the greatest director of all times - it turned into an exceptionally strong movie. So strong, that if your heart is not made of stone, and your brain - of interstellar vacuum, this film will make something horrible with you: it will break your heart, and it will burn your brain. And you will suffer from it. And if you are too emotional, or if you are alone in this moment, I tell you with a good intention: don't watch it!SPOILERSYou have to watch three hours, till you get to the point. All of it was made for the last minute, and whoever has slept through it, will not get it. Happiness had passed, tragedy had passed and suffering had passed. And then... Oh, dear god, this broke me. Oh, how she threw it! It cut me through my heart, through my brain, through my soul... My whole face started to ache, like if it has been put in a hydraulic press.A lot of time after I watched it, after many months had passed, after many hours of thinking, I understood what made my face ache. She didn't throw just a valuable diamond, searched by so many people, in the bottomless waters of the cold ocean. She didn't throw just a memory (although it was a kind of a memory, that was reminding her dear moments, lived so many years ago - moments that she had passed so many times through her head). What she threw were hundreds of trillions of dollars, and all the computers in the world, and the combined natural resources of Asia, and 150 million square kilometers of inhabitable land, and the whole Earth, and solar systems, and galaxies, and universes... Cause none of these things could return what she had lost - as time is OMNIPOTENT and IRREVERSIBLE.But she didn't look suffering, when she threw it. And I know why. She was old. She was at the end of her journey. She longed for oblivion. When she threw it, she smiled, as if she threw a burden. At this moment she was saying ""Goodbye"" to the life. For her it was a relief. For me it was painfully sad. I saw the whole tragedy of mortality, of transience, of evanescence, of forgetfulness. I saw how the old memories dwell only in the minds of the old people, how they fade and how they disappear with them, like falling yellow leaves in the autumn. I saw her story, I realized that there were billions more stories like that, of billions old people - stories better or worse, shorter or longer, more or less interesting and intriguing - which eventually would fade together with the old, and would turn into rotting leaves on the ground, and people would step on them, and nobody would neither know, nor imagine what treasure they were.I think now: at least I saw her story. She redeemed the people from ""Titanic"" to life again and now they are here, in front of me, though for a while. Living, with reddish faces from the wine, straightly brought from the dark, cold ocean bottom - not that it makes me feel better. They laugh, they drink from the glasses and stare at me, and laugh even higher; and then, in an instant, their faces turn pale, turn grey, and their smiles disappear. And they begin looking cold and sad, and serious. And they say to me, with a frozen cup in their hands: ""LIVE! Live now, fully! Take everything and remember everything, cause one day you will have only memories! We are dead and cannot live, but you live as much as you can. And please, remember us! We were not bad people, were we?"" And all this - from her memory...And then - she was dreaming. She was RETURNING IMAGES, she was REFRESHING MEMORIES, as this was the only thing she could do to beat the time; to fight with it, before it defeats her too. She was dreaming about the so insultingly short moments of true happiness she had in her life. She was dreaming of what she never had, and never would have. She was dreaming in frightful tranquility, in her last years, in the twilight of her life...Achingly sad.",Titanic

1231,akhanna-28238,The greatest film of all time.,10,30 May 2017,"3000 men worked for two years to build the most gigantic ship of all time,The Titanic,the ship which couldn't sink. 2208 bid farewell to southampton in april 1912.Little did they know that this unsinkable ship was going to sink on its maiden voyage itself. Tragedy struck,1503 people died leaving the whole world shell- shocked. Good story for a movie,right? So James Cameron decided to do it.Years of obsession,research,plotting and 200 million USD went into making this film making it the costliest and the riskiest film of all time. The result? Titanic became the highest grossing movie ever and is still the 2nd highest grosssing film of all time,only 2nd to james cameron's own avatar. What makes the film so special? Its the way it unfolds,the way it is engineered by cameron. The writing,special effects are beyond brilliant,the fictional part of the film has become iconic,everything clicks. When the movie starts,during 1st few seconds,the background music plays and right there you know that this film is going to be special,it goes on for more than 3 hours and in those 3 hours,we are told the great story of the titanic. We get to experience the splendour of the ship,know the perspective of ALL the characters and that in my opinion is where the film wins. Cameron lets us to see the things from every character's perspective,be it jack,fabrizio,rose,her mother,her fiancé,her fiance's right hand,the captain,the passengers,EVERYONE. We see how they see things and it is amazing. The tragedy is shown in perhaps the best possible way.The thrill,the tension,the fascination,the grandeur,the love,the tragedy,in these 200 minutes,we experience it all. Kudos to Cameron for making this unforgettable and immortal piece of cinema which will be watched and loved by generations to come. From a guy who has seen the whole film in excess of 130 times and is still in awe of this magical story,here's a piece of advise- watch this film now if u haven't.

1234,matthew-scrutton,"great ship, bad love story.....",8,16 December 2005,"OK, so Titanic may not be everyones idea of a great film. And I agree with them. Despite his good intentions, Cameron has apparently used the tragic disaster that was Titanic as the backdrop for a forbidden romance. Now I am an enthusiast of the Titanic, and know quite a bit about it. And because of this, I raised a few questions in my head. What about the Californian, the ship whose captain was blamed for standing by and doing nothing (which was proved wrong 60 years after the sinking)? If you look carefully as the ship leaves port, the stacks are red! Now this is potentially historically accurate. Had the ship lived, she would have these colours put on when Cunard took over the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company (or White Star Line). But for the film it is wrong. There was too much emphasis on the love story, but seeing the two lovebirds run around the huge interior of the ship did give a nice tour! However, it did start to get annoying after a while, because I only watched it for the ship! The underwater scenes were credible, well executed, and looked very good. It was a very good and dramatic way that the ship was portrayed sinking, and when the stern is in the air, and the lights go out and the ship breaks her back, it really brought a few shivers as the windmill sized screws slammed back into the water, crushing a few people on the way. In conclusion, the story of the sinking was very well played out, the love story was good to a point, after which it got a bit tedious, and the whole essence of ""panic"" as the ships complement realise the great liner is irreversibly sinking beneath their feet is excellent. I especially enjoyed watching the engine room scenes. However, if Cameron ever makes another film about a luxury liner going down (Lusitania HINT HINT) then would he be so kind as to not put a love story into it, because really, the film only succeeded because girls went to see the ""pretty boy"" actor make his debut, and ended up sobbing because he had to ""die"".Watch it if you love the RMS Titanic, if you don't, then don't watch it at all, because 3 hours of Leo D Capro professing his love to Winslet will bore you, as he really doesn't look like he's seen the action in this film!",Titanic

In the first half of the movie, you can enjoy a pure love story.However, in the second half, it changes to a panic story with life and death.

1238,bottledgoose,You bunch of Party Poopers.,10,12 January 1999,"Okay, I've been on both sides of the fence. I saw the movie. I loved the movie. Are you kidding?? I was sobbing from the moment the orchestra started playing ""Nearer my God to thee."" (Of course, my friend should not have taken me to see it in an attempt to cheer me up...) Then I got caught up in the trend of dogging the movie. ""Oh it has an awful screenplay."" ""Oh, Kate Winslet and DiCaprio can't act."" ""Oh, the story is so contrived."" ""Oh, the movie is too long."" ""Oh, gawd, if I have to listen to Celine Dion sing 'My Heart Will Go On' one more time I'm going to bash my radio against the wall.""And then I saw it again and got my head on straight. Okay, so the love story is cheesy. ALL LOVE STORIES ARE CHEESY. Otherwise they wouldn't be so goddamned interesting. Next time you fall in love see how intellectual you behave. Yes Celine Dion is awful, but the song is gorgeous when orchestrated (and probably would be if Celine Dion weren't singing it). My only problem with the special effects is that they cost too damned much but let's be realistic - if the people doing them were doing it for the love of computer animation instead of for sucking millions out of Hollywood, it wouldn't have. All the roles are fine for the purposes they served. The Asshole, the mean mother, the lost lover . . . Trust me, it's no cheesier than another great love story I can think of. Do you recognize this one? Boy meets girl at Party. Boy has to marry girl the next day or else, despite the fact that she is from the family of a sworn enemy. Girl agrees. Boy kills girl's Cousin. Oops, he just violated the local ruler's decree, he must now be exiled. Girl feigns death to avoid distasteful marriage. Boy hears girl is dead, kills himself. Girl hears boy is dead, kills herself. Families reconcile. All in the space of four days. And yet everyone loves this story. Yes I'm talking about Romeo and Juliet. I repeat, ALL LOVE STORIES ARE CHEESY. So why does everyone mind that this one is too?Get real, rent the video or order it on Pay-per-View, see it without the gaggle of heckling friends you went to see it with before. Or if you haven't seen it, goodness me, how can you expect the rest of us to respect your position on the movie IF YOU HAVEN""T EVEN SEEN IT? Come on! Don't believe the hype either way.

1241,Luke_P,I don't get the joke.,3,7 April 1999,"I went in to the film with low expectations. I thought the acting wouldn't be brilliant, nor would the script, but the special effects would make up for it - much like Godzilla.But I thought, yes - I'll put 4 hours of my life into this effort. 4 hours that I will never get back, no matter what I do.My summary: 1. Lame script and dialogue 2. Weak acting from all and sundry (except perhaps Billy Zane and definitely his bodyguard - who rocked in Twin Peaks) 3. Romantic moments, cliched and signalled from on far by the use of the theme 4. For the first 3 hours of the film, pretty weak special effects. The ship and the sky were both clearly computer generated for most of the film.The sky looked incredibly fake: it was more star-studded than Mars Attacks.Secondly, when people can't act (or rather, don't act: both leads gave superb performances in other movies, eg. DiCaprio in 'Gilbert Grape' and Winslet in 'Heavenly Creatures'), one would expect them to be pleasurable eye-candy. Here, DiCaprio really keeps up his end of the bargain. He's too good looking. Grrr. But Kate Winslet seems peculiarly miscast. Her english accent breaks through, and she is not particularly attractive. Subjective sexism aside, though, I cannot understand how the academy felt her performance was of Nominee standard.Once the ship starts sinking, the special effects do improve some, but very little else does: the ridiculously cliched script continues unfazed, making the characters implausible. Anyone as evil as Zane's character would wear an eye-patch, and Leonardo DiCaprio would have been shot by someone.A film, I feel, completely outclassed by all of it's conominees for Best Picture. LA Confidential and As Good As It Gets both shine out as excellent movies, time and time again. The academy needs to get a grip.Also, what was the Gloria Stuart nomination about?",Titanic

This proves that special effects and realism are not one and the same thing in historical drama.The fictional characters (and some non-fictional ones) were nicely cliched, the romantic subplot having no bearing on any historical accuracy in relation to the period depicted, let alone the specific events. For example, any woman running through a boiler room of a ship of the period would be probably regarded as insane, and apprehended. She would also come out of it rather black. The fictional suicide of Officer Murdoch is in bad taste, considering he survived the sinking and rendered valuable assistance to survivors - this is, after all,  a movie which purported to be strong on historical accuracy.The lead characters are wooden; perhaps if the subplot had been real, they would have made excellent life rafts? The characters which say least are probably the most memorable. Examples would be Captain Smith (Bernard Hill) and Thomas Andrews (Victor Garber), not to mention the ship itself (or the iceberg).So, for all the millions spent on special effects, you still have a ""made for TV"" disaster movie which, in my personal view, is of lesser status than the Poseidon Adventure.My advice would be to watch ""A Night to Remember"" rather than this - that IS a valid account of an awful event.",Titanic

1244,nighthwk,the epic that isn't,6,15 October 1998,"Probably the most over-rated film of the last few years, Titanic is not the great epic that every teenage girl has made it out to be.  In many ways it is like Gone With the Wind - beautiful to look at, with some fine acting (mostly by Winslet), but with a horribly contrived, trite plot and horrendous dialogue.  The characters are paper thin and are ridiculous. What a waste of 200 million dollars.",Titanic
1245,zettel-2,Splashy final spoils a great movie,6,25 January 2001,"This could have been a really good film  clever script, brilliant set, mostly convincing actors. If I can nevertheless only award an average assessment, it's because of the last half hour or so that drowns the real drama in a lot of splash and spludder.  Doesn't a ship sinking with 2000 people on board not provide enough tension, emotions and tragedy?So what's the point of adding all this chasing around of the main characters in pointless pursuits? Had Cameron cut out ca. 15 Minutes at the end he would really have created one of the great films",Titanic
1246,Xenomorph,Titanic: The best film ever made,10,29 November 1998,"In no doubt, Titanic from 1997 is the best film I've ever seen, and will probably remain so for a long while. James Cameron has always been one of my favourite directors, and this time, he's made his finest work so far. Hopefully, there's more to come of these top class Cameron films. One day in the end of April 1998 I went into the cinema to see Titanic, and I had waited for months to see it. I thought it would be a really great film, I had great expectations because almost everyone who had seen it said I was so good, and it was a thousand times better than I thought. It's an amazing story about the rich first-class girl Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) who falls in love with the third-class passenger Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), who won his ticket with a lucky hand of poker, and together they experience the kind of love we all want to have, but seldom find. I've never actually appreciated love stories on film, but this film changed my opinion about what really makes a good movie. It's not just cool action scenes, but also romantic love stories. And Titanic has both of them, the best parts of two totally different worlds of filmmaking, combining the best special effects ever and a great love story. This movie has everything, great script, direction, acting, music (James Horner is the best music composer of all time) and a lot of other things. The movie is so perfect, there's almost nothing I've noticed which is wrong. Of course there are things that don't match the real happenings, such as the flashlights from the lifeboat, which never were there in reality. But it's not a documentary, it is a film, and everything does not have to be absolutely correct to make it a good film. James Cameron is the best!",Titanic
1247,Xenomorph,"The best I've seen, deserved all it got.",10,11 November 1999,"Titanic is absolutely the best film I've ever seen. It has great direction (James Cameron is one of the very finest of his kind), a great script (again, thanks to Jim), but there were a few flaws of course, although less then in any other film I've seen. The acting is superb, from the main characters to the smallest supporting roles. And thanks to James Horner's music it's an even more wonderful experience. One of the best soundtracks I've heard, among the one for Schindler's List and a few others. And techically it was also a true masterpiece. THe effects are stunning, it really deserved all the technical awards it received, and all other awards too by the way. A great film with very few flaws. A 10 out of 10 from me, actually.",Titanic
1248,Annalene,Absolutely a masterwork!,10,8 February 1999,"This movie portrays how a society based on money = power really function in sticky situation. It gives a fair picture of how unfair this system can work. Along with being a realistic and believable movie, James Cameron manages to hold the audience's attention by evolving the movie and the historic happenings around the beautiful love story that occurs between Rose and Jack. Although the ending might seem unfair (I think I cried my heart out), the moral is that unless you are willing to let go of ""the safe solution"" in life you will never be able to gain something better. She did.  A wonderful movie that will make you laugh, boil with anger, cry, shake your head - you name it. It is absolutely a ""must-see"" movie, that surely will make you think. 10/10 stars! Enjoy!!! (make sure you are in a situation where you can cry, and don't have to worry about your mascara running - that will just spoil part of the joy of seeing it!)",Titanic
1249,Bob-393,It was wonderful!,10,19 February 1999,"I love romances.  ""Lovie dovie"" movies are my favorite and although this movie was not perfect by far, it showed true romance.  It does seem to me though that there should have been perhaps a little more emphasis on the sinking of the ship rather than the romance of Jack and Rose.  As much as I like the romance part, I am also interested in historical events too.",Titanic
1250,Kane-C,A common love story with a misguiding title,8,28 June 1999,"The story of the love between two people from entirely different worlds. Why is this movie called ""Titanic""? This is a love story, and the plot has just about nothing to do with the ship itself, Titanic is just the set. The plot is not that bad, but there's nothing special about it, the same story has been seen a million times. Some of the actor/actress performances are very good, and director James Cameron does an exceptional job. But good acting and direction do not make a great movie without a great script. Why this movie was such a grand hit, I can't tell. Maybe it's the effects, maybe the acting, maybe even the music, who knows. Titanic is a pretty good movie, and watching it is not a waste of time, but the fact remains, that the movie is a thirteen-a-dozen-type of love story.",Titanic
1251,bramasto,iI is a masterpiece......,1,28 August 1999,"..... for a blind man who can't see the different between good movie and the bad one. actually, i admit that titanic is a very good movie. but the good part from this movie just the technics, e.g. visual effect, sound effect, editing, art direction, etc. i think the most important part from a movie is story and the performance of all cast. and titanic had sucessfully failed on that part. what a mess movie. it has an excellent technic, but weak in the story. it's like a human being without soul. it had prooven by the result of 1997 academy award that refuse to give the award for best original screenplay, best actress, and the supporting one, best actor (especially this one. leo is playing very, very bad.). i think i'll just stand next to the other film criticisian who believe that the 1997 best movie is not titanic. say congratulation to.... : ""L.

1252,Rich-197,Populism par excellence,1,12 July 1999,"Oh, I do have to bow my head to ""Titanic"".But not to Cameron for creating a visual feast. Not to the actors for such inspiring, and creative characterisation (sic), but instead, I bow my head to mourn for the loss of respect for the millions of people who returned to see this twaddle more than once.A nauseatingly dreadful, utterly manipulative, saccharine dusted gob of tedious pap.Doubtless it will be hailed as the greatest film ever by those who think ""Aliens"" is better than ""Alien"", and who think that film history started with ""Jaws"".",Titanic
1253,Rich-197,"Transcending boundaries of race, class, and sex",1,14 August 1999,"Titanic is possibly the film of the decade - it manages to show that one thing transcends barriers between all the people of the world - ignorance. The incredible storytelling ability of Cameron, his audacity with special effects, and his casting prowess (who would have thought that by casting an ugly girl against a attractive guy, he would create the romance of the decade?) It's incredible hokum. What so many of the Anti-Titanic camp fail to realise is that bad acting, duff script, and glossy special effects don't necessarily mean a bad film (Star Wars as an example). The key point here is that Cameron's huge ability to target the world's biggest niche audience (the dumb middle class) is something that should be celebrated. He should be a role-model for all film makers out to make a financial success - exploitation is the key. I can sum this up in one sentence: The brains behind this picture deserve to have the $1.8billion success - the film itself doesn't",Titanic
1254,BigDWS,Not exactly a great movie...,5,27 December 1999,"Unlike the majority of the population, I did not see ""Titanic"" in a theatre. My sisters (who love Leonardo DiCaprio) bought the video and I saw it at home. I must say that I was disappointed. With all of the hype and accolades, I expected a masterpiece from director James Cameron. Instead, I watched a boring drama with poor acting. First of all, in my opinion, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet cannot act. Perhaps with different lead actors I would have liked the film, but with those two actors playing Jack and Rose the movie began to sink -- like the Titanic. Secondly, perhaps it was just my eyes, but everything seemed brand new on the set. I realize that the Titanic was a new ship, but even at the beginning of the movie, the place where Jack was playing cards, his clothes, etc. all seemed impeccably clean. That feature didn't really make the movie bad at all, but was a detail that stood out for me. Then, of course, there is the length of the movie itself -- about 3 hours. After the first hour I could (and almost did) fall asleep, wake up an hour later and not have missed anything. The movie drags on forever...in the end, I was left wondering how the movie could be so popular. I honestly didn't find it emotionally-moving at all. It's not a bad movie, but not exactly a great movie either. I'm glad I didn't spend money to see it in the theatre.",Titanic
1255,destiny_starr18,DUMB!!!,1,4 February 2000,The only thing I got from this movie was a frightful headache...They could've made it one tape and it would've been good but they had to drag the stupid story(Which wasn't much of one)out! Watch the first tape..but forget the last one!It's really not worth the headache You'll more than likely get! The stupid flashing lights really get to you after the first time you see them..But after the second You want to scream... And then they have to drag the sinking ship out for one whole tape..really a dumb movie and I don't know why everyone raved about it unless they liked staring at Kate's boobs...Thats the only thing I can figure...And the old women was really stupid... Leo's acting really stunk...And it seems to me they couldn't make up their mind on the millionares role in the whole dumb movie....If he so cared about himself he would've forgot about the slut and left... Really a stupid movie...One word describes it well...DUMB!!!,Titanic
1256,Threepwood,"Good movie, but full of itself. ""Does the boat sink?""",7,17 February 2000,"This was a great film in most respects, but I didn't like the choice of lead actor. They could have found ANYONE more masculine than DiCaprio to play the supposedly rugged, virile All-American boy. Some of the lines are just plain bad. ""I'm the king of the world!""The special effects are indeed spectacular, but I found myself growing bored waiting for the iceberg to come. I have to admit that the fantastic sinking sequence is a good reward for being dragged to see the movie by your date and sitting through hours of love story.7 out of 10, just because I don't like DiCaprio",Titanic
1257,MattMan79,Special effects weren't enough,5,19 September 2000,"I think the reason I was so disappointed in this movie was because I didn't go to see a ship sink, or to awe at the ""spectacular"" special effects. I went to see it based on terrific earlier performances by Leonardo DiCaprio in ""The Basketball Diaries"", ""This Boy's Life"", and ""William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet"", ""Marvin's Room"", etc...; as well as Kate Winslet's roles  in ""Hamlet"", ""Jude"", and ""Sense and Sensibility"". She's also since done great work in ""Hideous Kinky"" and ""Holy Smoke"". In hindsight, though, that may have been a bit credulous.I knew going in that the main pith of the movie was the state-of-the-art effects showing the preeminent Titanic sinking. I had hoped that that was going to be an added bonus, not the only thing worth mentioning. I found the whole storyline of Kate Winslet, the rich, upper class socialite, ""Rose"", falling in love with DiCaprio's rag-tag, wrong-side-of-the-tracks, ""Jack"", very cliched. As the formula goes, he repulses her at first, then they grow to love each other, then they realize they can't have each other because of their class differences, but love perseveres. And, naturally, there has to be the evil boyfriend, played here by Billy Zane as ""Cal"", who seems charming and elegant on the surface, but has a mean and jealous fervor in him. There are a lot of other ingredients to be interpolated into the formula, but this is the gist of it, and the material never strays too far off the beaten path.Now, I have been to movies where all I expected to see is great action & special effects, and conceded that the acting and story weren't exactly on the front burner. ""Mission: Impossible II"" comes to mind. However, I was so disappointed that this movie, which I don't think you could classify as ""action"", and with all of its potential, turned out to be so mediocre. The story and plot were very hackneyed and trite, and the actors really had no room to move in such a formulaic offering. If you want some good titles to look at from 1997, try ""Good Will Hunting"", ""L.A. Confidential"", or ""As Good As It Gets"".In the end, for me, the special effects weren't enough.",Titanic
1258,Heather Sayas,Exquisite Movie,8,1 March 2000,"This is cerartanly a movie to remember, a tragical love story with wonderful cinematography, good dialogues and exquisite performances from Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio and Gloria Stuart.Cameron is fateful to the original facts that happened aboard the TITANIC, that cold night of 1912, it's almost like if the story grabs you and pulls you inside the celuloid, it makes you feel the fear and desperation that all the people felt during the sinking.Kate Winslet is wonderful as an old-fashined lady, even when Leo DiCaprio's fame leaves her behind they both are excelent and they fit perfectly into their roles. I am a little mad because everybody treats Kate bad because she was a little overweighted, but she is healthier than all those skinny models out there, Imagine Kate Moss as Rose!Leo is awsome, I am actually mad at the ACADEMY because he never got a nomination, he was great, and he deserved at least a nomination!If you call yourself a ""Movie Fan"" you must see this movie.9 stars and it worths it",Titanic

There are so many plot holes in this film that even an amateur cinematographer could critique it. The historical continuity was horrid. The only bright spots in the cast were Cate Blanchett and Bernard Fox.

1262,Sub-atomic,Same Old Story,3,18 November 2000,"Folks, I'd just like to point a couple of thing out to you.  There is an art to movie-making.  Part of that art involves developing a story-line. Unless it is a satire, or otherwise involves a comment on an existing story-line, a good movie will have an original story line.  Titanic was a romance with a story that has been told before, too many times to count.  The inaccessible girl, the boy who must overcome the odds, including a better-placed suitor, to get the girl.  Such a lack of imagination makes for a bad movie. Titanic was an unimaginative story with a very large budget.There is an art to marketing.  To market something, you appeal to people's emotional centres.  One of the best way to do this is to apply the tried and tested formula of the human courtship ritual.  Gets 'em every time (if you spend enough money).Titanic was an extremely good marketing exercise.  However, many people who don't know better, got good marketing confused with good movie making.  Let me make this clearer for you.  Titanic was a good marketing exercise. Titanic was also a bad movie.",Titanic
1263,ramteen89,"Outstanding, excellent and entertaining movie, but not without flaws.",8,7 August 2008,"Basically, I liked this movie, because I like those kinds of fairy tale-like stories where two people from a completely different social class meet and fall in love (Aladdin and Pretty Woman, for instance). There is also the bit where each lover's friends try to persuade them to forget one another, and this is the bit where I think came the MAJOR flaw of the movie: the amount of bribery made it quite unreal.I mean, imagine a powerful business tycoon like Cal Hockley bribes every single steward on the ship to keep Jack and Rose apart, and then tries to kill them out of spite when he learns he won't win Rose. That was the one thing I absolutely hated and found very unreal about the movie (until Murdoch threw the bribe in Cal's face: I loved that bit). The rest of the characters were very well done as well, and I am VERY surprised Billy Zane did not receive an Oscar nomination for his performance.All in all, this movie was and will always be one of the best, but I don't think it really deserved the Best Picture Oscar over ""As Good as It Gets"" and ""The Full Monty"". It most probably won all those Oscars because of the special effects, because Kate Winslet's performance was CERTAINLY Oscar-worthy, and she didn't win (ironically, it went to Helen Hunt for ""As Good as It Gets"", ""laugh"").In the end, everyone knew the story of the Titanic and how it sunk, so to me, the only special part was the side story (Jack, Rose and Cal). I expected nothing more. In my opinion, ""The Full Monty"" had a much better and realistic storyline to it, but then again, since when do comedies (even black ones) have a chance at the Oscars? Astounding, but not flawless. 8/10 stars.",Titanic

This movie is comparable to Pearl Harbor, in where we have a historic event get skewed by some sappy, bogus love story about a misunderstood painter. I was surprised and jubilant to find that this movie is out of the top 250 on IMDb as voted by it's users.

This film just about changed my mind.You see.... what scares me is that IF there is indeed a heaven and hell then at this time in my life I'm not quite sure which one I'll be going to....That doesn't sound so scary you say. Let me elaborate..I believe that if there is indeed a hell, then for me it would consist of watching an endless loop of a grown woman standing on the bow of a ship proclaiming ""I can fly!"" and a big thank you from myself goes out to the makers of this film for providing just the source of that punishment for me when I do eventually end up in the afterlife.Ahhh thats off my chest now. So what can I say about Titanic?James Cameron. I am actually  what you'd call a fan of his work. Terminator, Aliens, Strange Days, The Abyss. Much of the work he has had a hand in I rate as some of my favourite movies ever. So what possessed him to do this?????Kate Winslet and Billy Zane. These are two of my favoured actors..What possessed them to do this??? If you want to see Kate Winslet in a GOOD film try to find ""Heavenly Creatures"" which is indeed an excellent film. Likewise for Billy Zane get a hold of ""Dead Calm"".In essence this film is 2 + hours of cliched, Low IQ, utterly awful, Mills & Boon romance that is so sugarcoated it's likely to send any diabetic person watching it into a fit. The ONLY saving grace of this film is the final hour after the Titanic has struck the iceberg and then proceeds to sink which is when we are treated to the James Cameron we know and love. It's just a damn shame that to get to this part I had to sit through 2 hours+ of a film that made my eyes bleed.The sheer amount of money this film has made at the box office as well as the quite high rating it receives here on IMDB is truly a testament to the old adage that there's no accounting for (bad) taste.OverallThe prospect of hammering rusty nails through my manhood is infinitely more appealing than that of watching the first 2 hours of this film ever again.3 stars out of 10 (solely for the last hour but having to sit through the first 2 hours of this atrocity to get to this stage is simply unforgiveable).",Titanic

Even if you don't care much for the love story, you'll be blown away by the sets and the actual sinking. There's not many movies like this where they rebuild a ship and then sink it over and over to get the perfect shot. It was very much worth it in the end because you feel like you're actually witnessing the tragedy unfold in front of you. While the sinking isn't 100% accurate today, it was as close as they could manage to get it back then. There are a couple of things that are controversial with the families of the survivors and victims, though, such as William Murdoch's death, and the director did later admit he should've done things slightly differently in that regard.

Now not everyone will love these movies - I know that they're not all my favourites, but they will never be forgotten.For every movie, I can see reasons why people might not like that movie, but in this movie I can see no reason why someone would dislike this movie. It really annoys me when people say that they don't like this movie, because it is a superb movie with no weak points and the only reason why people say they don't like it is to try and be different, as when this movie was released ten years ago, everyone loved it, but when people keep on singing its praises, people want to not like it, so they watch it and try to not like it.The acting is superb, the director is superb and I don't think that it's possible for anyone to watch it without crying. It is the perfect love story combined with one of the greatest disasters of all times and they combine brilliantly to give one of the greatest movies of all time.The story moves at the perfect pace for this movie and shows times back then and the excitement at this brand new top class ship, which makes you even more upset when the corridoors are being filled with water.Of course there is that classic scene when Leo and Kate (who give flawless performances) are holding their hands outstretched at the end of the ship, which will be remembered forever as a classic scene in movie history.Summing up, this is an unbelievably good film, which is perfect in all places.",Titanic
1275,Carl Halling,Star-making blockbuster,4,26 December 2001,"Until ""Titanic"", Kate Winslet and Leo DiCapprio had been the most gifted young actors of their generation, both capable of quite extraordinarily profound insights into the human soul, given their tender years. In James Cameron's Oscar-winning film, they constitute one of the most attractive couples in movie history. And so they became world superstars. But as I see it, they deserve their fame. It is a tragic thing to see acting greatness remain more or less unsung, or underrated. And in ""Titanic"" Kate Winslet supplies a magnetic and powerful performance. Moreover, The scenes depicting the sinking of the ship are thrilling to behold. ""Titanic"" is in short a fine film, which made megastars out of two magnificent young artists, a compromise between artistic integrity and commercial clout.",Titanic

Your ego has truly created a film of such mind-numbing tedium that can't even be taken seriously.This might have been a nicely entertaining film if it wasn't so self-aware in it's epic scope. It has far too many villains... ALL of whom get there Hollywood styled come-uppance in the final act. This makes the film muddled and instead of showing the tragedy of the Titanic incident it just shows a complete disregard for human life that is sickening.Also, I was offended by the way the romance completely overshadowed the loss of command and anarchy. That's what this film SHOULD have been... let it not be said that there isn't an intriguing sub-plot hidden away in here, which is unfortunately just made ridiculous here by the fact that everyone seems to be out to keep De Caprio (in a very mundane performance) and Winslet apart.Cameron has the biggest ego in Hollywood and he has proven that with this film. Ironically, this is also the largest grossing film of all time. Basically this means that Cameron's ego is now so big... that any script that comes near him will be devoured. All that I ask of him is that he doesn't go near Alien 5.This is proof that Hollywood can't produce anything of worthwhile substance. The fact that the ""general public"" (as I call them) lapped this up like hoards of mindless puppies almost destroys my faith in the world and hence the potential audiences of true genius film-makers.Shame really.",Titanic
1277,Racina,Outstanding Achievement - But I understand why many don't like it.,10,12 July 2009,"Titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. It has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable.When I stumble across someone who asks me why I like Titanic, I suppose my first reaction is ""wait a minute, you don't?"" I know so many people who don't like this movie, and I'm not saying I don't see why. ""The love story is too cheesy"" well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? All right, the love story between Jack and Rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. But this is a movie, doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? The next complaint, DiCaprio and Winslet are terrible actors. Well, OK, in this movie, I agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. However I think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors. I personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. But the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but I agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.And finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then I'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. It's like people who complain The Dark Knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. Simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this IS a good movie.Well deserving of its Oscars, in particular, Best Cinematography, which I find to be the best I've ever seen in a movie save maybe the Lord of the Rings trilogy.I know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. The flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the Titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.I understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.I can tell you that I have read more than five books about the Titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. The only main ones I can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.I give this movie 10/10, not because I like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.",Titanic

All for sensationalism and turned into a mega-soap opera. Focusing on the plight of two 1990's teenagers decked out in costumes as if they inhabited 1912 but nobody was fooled. The whole thing was ludicrous as they slogged their way for hours in freezing ocean water in soaked clothing, ending up in the ocean of course -- but only she was saved.

Simply the kind of movie, which you can't describe in words, you have to watch it, at least once! , to see what we, the people who appreciate this movie, are talking about. After watching it for 3 times already in my life, i still can't believe i've seen a gigantic ship sinking in a film, with such an incredible realism. I heard there were used some test puppets to make it look like people were falling off the ship, well i haven't noticed any, everything looked so real, all the people that were falling and screaming for help. The fictional story about the 2 main characters, falling in love, is genially directed, some of the scenes are very touching, very well filmed. And the casting was great, i don't want to hear any stupid replies that DiCaprio is a bad actor, hell no ! Him and Kate Winslet both did a great job, there's no doubt about their acting skills whatsoever. Those who are calling this a bad movie, i hope you people never watch a movie ever again, cause i assume all you know is teenage comedies and horror movies. Also, please stop calling us ""pathetic titanic fan boys"", this is not twilight where 15 year old girls claim it to be the best movie because Robert Pattinson is part of the cast. I am a man, i watched this movie 3 times already, and i didn't cry, i just know how to appreciate a well made movie, WE, all of us that do, millions of people, much more then those of you that hate it, claim this to be a superb masterpiece. And the few of you that didn't enjoy it, i am glad, i am glad that you aren't capable of appreciating good movies, and i hope you stick with the genres i stated above, you didn't even deserve to watch it actually. I recommend this film to everybody, no matter the age, and if you didn't like it (unlikely), keep your opinions for you, they are not welcomed here, as you definitely don't have any idea how a good film looks like.",Titanic

The script is solid, the acting is great, the visual effects are excellent and the score is perfect. Movies like this are rare, and we haven't seen films like this since the likes of Gone with the Wind.

The set design and costuming - all the period details, really - were fantastic, and the plot, albeit formulaic, at least held to Hollywood's general standard of mediocrity, and no worse than that. But where is it written that the length of a movie has to be relatively commeasurate to the vessel on which it is set? What this movie needed was a good editing - preferably by an editor armed with a chainsaw. Instead of settling for a passable 5-star, yea, even enjoyable 6-star historical romance, they shot for the moon - and produced an exercise in tedium and self-indulgence. I find it most noteworthy for the fact that it is the only movie in film history that ever managed to make me root for an iceberg. An unusual sensation, and no mean feat.",Titanic

1286,escapoholic,You wouldn't hate it so much if you didn't like it in spite of yourself,7,9 September 2006,"My son was born the year this was made, and he's had a life-long interest in the Titanic; as a result, I've seen the '53 and '58 movies as well as this one several times.Yes, all the supporting characters are one-dimensional, the screenplay has holes you could drive a truck through, and the dialogue is poor to god-awful. ""I really like the way he uses color,"" says Jack of a Monet on board.Rose and Jack's second scene will make you cringe on so many levels the more times you see it. The 17-year-old Rose, spoiled, depressed, and well-schooled in Freud, takes a gratuitous interest in Jack's sketchbook, then unexpectedly decides in the course of a few seconds that he's really some artist. You'd think in a 200+ minute move they could take a little more time with this bit, which is a turning point in their relationship. It's too bad that Cameron doesn't seem to think it matters whether anything that happens with the characters makes sense.But in the end, the characters aren't really what matters in terms of whether the movie works, at least for me. Silly as Jack and Rose's story is, it does move the action along. Neither DiCaprio nor Winslett look right for their parts (no getting around her looking at least 5 years older than him), but the actors provide enough spark to distract you from the movie's many flaws, at least for the first viewing or two.And the fact is, I didn't mind the the 200+ minutes at all when I saw it in the theater. (Contrast this with the vastly overpraised Return of the Kings, the last 20-30 minutes of which might have been the most excruciating experience of my movie-going life.) I'm sure there are flaws in the cinematography I didn't notice, but that combined with the score drew me into the experience and feel of being on the great ship at that point in history. I generally don't care for special effects, but there's no denying that those in Titanic '97 are integral to the action.As a three-year-old my son sat through the whole thing. Could be that makes the point for the people who hate Cameron's Titanic, but I sat through it too. I think Gloria Stewart deserved her Oscar. In the end, I think Cameron is over-criticized for not trying to make the movie many people wanted.Probably many of the ""haters"" had already seen the '53 and '58 movies. The former has the acting, screenplay, and dialogue that Cameron lacks, even though it obviously provided much of Cameron's inspiration, while the latter is serious in ways that Cameron apparently didn't appreciate.Still, Cameron's movie triggered a massive revival of interest in the Titanic, which it could only have done if it effectively communicated the awesome scale of the event in history. There's no getting around that even with his limitations, Cameron does care about the story of the Titanic, and the story, if not the characters, is well served by Cameron's strengths.",Titanic

But stick a robot and a giant llama in and hey, you've got a decent film. It's good when the main character dies at the end, but the other one doesn't because she gets to experience the same kind of trauma i went through by sticking with watching it. The plot is absolutely awful, the scriptwriters evidently have no imagination, and at 3 hours, i would literally rather watch my cat sleeping. the actual best part is the theme song at the credits, no only joking, that's as bad as the film is. anyway, if you have 3 hours to kill, do something else, this is absolute tripe.",Titanic
1288,Engage_With_Zorp,Why is this considered good?,4,11 October 2008,"I've never understood why this film garnered such critical and financial success. I've heard it said that it made so much money because teen girls kept going to see it over and over again due to Leo DiCaprio, but I don't think that's the case; I think some people just really liked this film.Which of course mystifies me. The plot is the stockiest of stock plots; high-society girl falls in love with lower-class, but fun-loving rogue. Cue sappy music. But oh, conflict! She's already engaged to someone else, but he's kind of a jerk and she doesn't really love him (I know, it surprised me, too). At the end, the boat sinks, of course, and Leo DiCaprio dies, apparently having realized that the movie he's in is no good.Do you see the problem here? Every aspect of this film is utterly predictable, every single character is a character we've seen countless time in other, better films, and yet the stupid thing is almost three-and-a-half hours long. It spends so much time ""developing"" these characters and situations that we've all seen before, one has to wonder if writer-director Cameron actually thinks he's done anything original here. Indeed, I found myself predicting scenes before they happened, and I was almost always right on the money - with the exception of the fact that the dialogue I had in my head was less cheesy and hackneyed than what was displayed on screen. The only mildly interesting part of the entire affair is the sinking of the ship, and even then I want everyone to hurry up and die so the movie can just END already.Unfortunately, the actors aren't even at their best here. DiCaprio is downright dreadful, which wouldn't be so unfortunate if he hadn't displayed far greater acting talent than he did here in just about every other movie he's ever been in. Winslet doesn't fare much better, but she does what she can with what's given her. What's worse, great actors and actresses are severely underused, as in the case of Kathy Bates, who is given a criminally small amount of screen time.In short - uninteresting characters, a predictable plot, cringe-inducing writing, and decent-to-dreadful acting make viewing this film a rather unpleasant business. The ending is good, but that's only by virtue of the phenomenal special effects - and special effects do not a good movie make (see: the Star Wars prequels).So, with all that in mind, again I ask ... why is this considered good?",Titanic

Kate Winslet gives an unforgettably performance and i suggest she dyes her hair that colour again because its so gorgeous. i loved what she wore and i bet every girl wishes they had her wardrobe (before the sinking obviously).

1291,farishthas,The Best Movie that I have ever seen,10,9 February 2014,"I am 24, I watched Titanic for the first time with my mother at the tender age of 7 years old... no cause for alarm, we were taught to close our eyes in age restricted scenes, which I did (technically).Titanic is the best movie that I have ever seen, I have probably seen it about 500 times since it was first released and I aim to see it once a year at least till I die. The glorious tale of tragic love upon the maiden voyage of a doomed luxury liner. Every time I see Titanic, I see it in a new light, I notice something different that I never noticed before and I cry all over again.The beauty of a movie like this is that it has the ability to cripple the strongest of men with emotion. Being a skeptic on love myself, I have to say that I am slightly glad at Jack's demise not because he's a bad character (in fact he's my favorite character) but because there is some realism to that aspect of the story. Up until the doom of Titanic sets in, it's all very Romeo and Juliet, the obsessed illusion of true love after barely days of knowing each other, at least Rose is hesitant of it at first, whereas Jack is smitten beyond comprehension... Alas, their supposed true love does not overcome the wrath of a very angry looking iceberg and of course Ismay's blatant challenge to God and all elements of an unsinkable ship. That being said we all know the fate of Titanic but this is not what makes this movie so wonderful... it is actually the integration of all characters, both little and large, whether it be the distraught Murdock, the grief stricken captain EJ or the delightfully despicable Hockley... they all merge together in a beautiful picture.. while the main characters and those closest to them were made up and given a slightly mediocre presence, it all fits in so well, tragedy, love, jealousy, arrogance, greed, honor, dedication and lust all get together to dance upon the ship of dreams.Whether you're male or female I'm pretty sure the ""I want you to draw me like one of your french girls"" scene was a tasty reminder at how erotic cinema can be without actual sex. sensuality at it's tender best but not my favorite scene in the movie... the most notable scene for me in Titanic was when the poorer passengers accepted their fate of death, the Irish mother and her kids, the old couple that embrace as water floods around their bed... those were scenes dripping with emotion... My favorite scene however, is when Rose joins Jack below decks to party with the third class folk... just goes to show that money does not make-th the man, a good heart does.The marvel of the ship in all it's grandeur made me realize that Mister James Cameron is a visionary, the attention to detail of a simple thing like cutlery was admirable. Shining performances did not come from Dicaprio and Winslet as some foolish viewers believe the shining performers were Kathy Bates, Billy Zane,Frances Fisher and Gloria Stuart.I can go on about what a brilliant movie this is but I should not.End note, excellent movie that every person should see at least once before they die.",Titanic

A three-hour-plus period piece that couldn't make its original release date (July 1997) and still ranks as the most expensive film of all time, ""Titanic"" seemed certain to sink when it was finally released in December of 1997. Its opening weekend was unremarkable- it barely reached the top of the box office and made just 10% of its budget back in that first 3 days... but then something amazing happened. Word-of-mouth has never been more explosive than in the case of ""Titanic"". For four straight months, the film dominated the world's box office, as audiences everywhere, young and old, male and female, were swept up by a perfect juxtaposition of adventure and romance. By breaking every box office record and sweeping the Academy Awards, ""Titanic"" was bound to garner a backlash- which may explain why many people seem to write this film off.

This boat caused the death of more than 1506 people.The film is a global success and received 11 awards and elected Best film.The film tells the story of two passengers in love on the Titanic.

People don't understand why Rose left down Jack . They think Rose should have let Jack get on board the raft,they think she is selfish.

The unending love for the story told in a way it was told. For another eight years, I was ignorant to it.
I recently saw a clip of Titanic which got me pumped to watch it again. I started watching with my brother who never liked Titanic for reasons I couldn't understand.
This time, not only did I remember what I missed, I felt the love with which it was made. Such magnificence. The story, style, chemistry of the actors and the characters being played, direction, score. Everything blended together to show why Titanic was ever popular! By the end of it, I was almost in tears with even the one watching with me praising it. And I finally witnessed what I was missing... Titanic.

Sure, the script might have been polished a bit more to make it less modern, but it was still very well done. The cinematography and the score are simply outstanding. A lot of people criticize Titanic because it didn't follow the real characters on the ship. Well, guess what. This was not meant to be a documentary. It was meant to be a fictional story set against the historically accurate background of the Titanic. Some people have tried to say that the movie was not accurate like Walter Lord's book. I have read the book, and Cameron must have memorized it to match the details so well. Besides, Lord wasn't even entirely accurate. His first book had the ship going down in one piece. Well, to all the critics of Titanic, I have this to say: If you want to go raise $200 million and make your own version of Titanic, you can do it however you want to. Cameron got the bucks for this, and it is his vision of the story. I happen to think it was money well spent.

As a film it is rightly to be considered a classic, both for the storyline (as seen from the perspective of the young lovers) and for the special effects.Kate and Leonardo perform well in their roles, but it's the character played by Billy Zane which gives the story that extra bite.

1305,Animal-3,Can't believe they wasted a good movie with such a poor script,4,5 April 1999,The special effects are of course ground breaking and the main redeeming feature of this overblown epic.  Unfortunately the plot and the dialogue are immensely disappointing and cause one to twitch and turn away.  Motion sickness bags should have been provided.  Would it not have been so much better if the protagonists had been a little less black and white.  Then a masterpiece could have been built on that wonderful background of one of the most compelling tragedies of the 20th century.,Titanic
1306,Dicekid,"Terrible, shame on Cameron",2,6 November 1998,"Probably the worst movie I've ever seen... after Death Stalker and Beyond The Door-2... and all the world goes bonkers about it?! Spielberg's Titanic is a very good movie for it has both the remarkable plot and superb actor's performance (due to limited space I won't go into comparison of these two movies further although I'd love to). I can't say the same about Cameron's so-called ""masterpiece"". Firstly, it's foundation, the raising of the safe and restoration of the drawing, is pretty shaky for pronounced absence of credibility. Any expert would confirm that a piece of paper (not even a photograph) exposed to sea water for 84 (?!) years can not remain undamaged (after the seaweeds were cleaned off its surface).Secondly, it is my understanding that each shot has to make sense. Here the camera fixes on captain's cup with a lemon slice in it and... nothing happens. Let alone floating plates (when the water floods the kitchen); everyone knows that porcelain sinks. It appears that after spending 300 mln to build the true-size model of Titanic Cameron didn't have any money left to buy expensive crockery, that's why stacks of cheap thick plates fall from shelves and break.Besides above technical blunders which went unnoticed by rapturous audience, the plot leaves much to be desired, let alone striking age (and weight) difference between Winslet and DiCaprio. Apparently, Cameron lacked dramatic material; his characters talk and behave as if they lived nowadays. I really doubt that at the beginning of the century anyone expressed his agitation and excitement the way DiCaprio's character, Jack did aboard Titanic. It's also unclear from where DiCaprio's character got a tuxedo. I didn't see him borrowing it from the laundry.Naturally, neither DiCaprio no Winslet received Oscar for their apology for actor's art. It's beyond my understanding how with all this Titanic received more Oscars than Gone With The Wind, as if unmatched performance of Lee-Gable duet can be bracketed with Winslet-DiCaprio's feeble attempts to act. Faces of actors playing lovers are lit up, their voices and gestures express their feelings. Here we see spiritless and non-expressive mugs. So where is Romeo and Juliet aboard Titanic, what should apprise the audience of their love? That they copulate on the back seat of the car? It's worthy of note that they do it quickly and without long verbal preludes, just like in modern America. This must be the explanation why Titanic became box-office hit of all times; the characters don't perform any epics of heroism or demonstrate superhuman physical or moral traits. Girls come to the movies with their boyfriends, watch Winslet and DiCaprio and think: ""Just like you and me!"" (I'm talking about the back seat of the car). Phenomenal success of Titanic might be of interest for psychiatrists as another mass hysteria. Or indication of love is that the characters spit overboard? Incidentally this episode is the only one where Winslet and DiCaprio succeeded, for it didn't require any actor's art.It should be also mentioned that in the scenes shot at the main hall with a staircase, while the main characters rush about in panic, extras in life-vests playing passengers just stand and chat peacefully; this is a crying nonsense under given circumstances. Rose's action when all of a sudden she runs out like mad and jumps overboard looks absolutely unmotivated. I'm also curious as to how Jack and Rose can run up to neck in freezing water and even dive, although it's known that a human can't last in a +2o C water longer than 10 minutes. Much later, as if he just remembered that he's an ordinary mortal, Jack suddenly froze and drowned, yet he had time for a sentimental goodbye to squeeze tears out of the sensitive audience.When a real natural calamity takes place people don't have time for melodramatic speeches and oaths; once they lost each other in panic-stricken crowd, they only find dead bodies of their beloved ones at the end. Only cancerous have enough time to bid farewell to their relatives.I must be a bad spectator for despite hundreds of millions of dollars invested in Titanic not a single teardrop welled up in my eyes. Feelings, emotions, and sympathy can not be purchased. You can't force yourself to worry when the plot is transparent, actor's art is none, the dialogues are banal and not a single phrase is remarkable. By no means I'm insensible, I worried about Thelma and Louise and cried at the end when their car flies off the precipice. Even Terminator lowering himself in melted metal or Rambo sobbing on Colonel's shoulder provoke more sympathy than all the characters in Titanic.Obviously, this year's Academy Awards ceremony's motto was ""To catch up with and pass Ben-Gur"". In its aspiration to give all the possible awards to Titanic the Academy came to an amusing incident: ""extracted from naphthalene"" Gloria Stuart, who only takes 10 minutes of screen time, was nominated for Oscar and, what is the most ludicrous, seriously hoped to receive the cherished statuette!As was to be expected, Titanic received all the awards except for the main parts. It is incomprehensible how can Titanic be a best movie of the year if none of the actors received Oscar? Actor's art is the very component that makes a movie. Then what's so good about Titanic? The question hangs in mid-air. The Academy judges, all together singing a laudatory ode to Titanic and extolling the director, James Cameron, didn't give attention to other, not less worthy of note, movies. Remarkably melodious song ""How do I live without you"" from Con Air was undeservedly offended. At least this award the Academy could have given to someone else, especially as this soundtrack was way better than doleful howls of Scottish dawdling coupled with Celine Dion.The only Oscar deserved by Titanic is the one for special effects. Being of no value in terms of artistry, this movie can be a visual aid for studying filming techniques. I find it hard to believe that such distinguished director as James Cameron, who did Terminator and True Lies, really thought that Titanic deserved all the awards it received. At least absurdly sounds his boastful allegation, borrowed from DiCaprio's character: ""I'm a king of the world!"". The phrase from well-known tale is on tip of my tongue: ""The king is naked!""",Titanic
1307,Michelle-15,Pretty Good,8,16 November 1998,"I thought that Titanic was a pretty good movie. I don't see why it was as big as it was but oh well. I think that Billy Zane (Cal) put in a very good performance. His was a very intense role and I think he did better than Kate or Leo. Another thing, not all women rave about Leonardo, those who do are mostly teenagers like myself, however I like men, (no offense Leo). I think that the graphics in this movie were very good except when they were zooming out on the Titanic at sunset where the whole thing and the people looked very unrealistic. Sorry, don't mean to bash anyone's work because I know that this movie took a LOT of it! All in all, very entertaining, I enjoyed this film.    (8/10)",Titanic
1308,billr-3,Well made bad movie.,6,23 November 1998,"Tragedy as action movie entertainment. Bill Paxton's lines at the end about not getting it could not have been more ironic. There wasn't a genuine emotion in the entire film. Winslet's performance was heroic, but not even the Wizard of Oz could have breathed life into these straw figures. Not since Around the World in Eighty Days has such a bad movie been so acclaimed.",Titanic
1309,Logic1,5/10 (just to get that out of the way),5,13 January 1999,"Sorry to add to the clutter, but isn't this just one of those films you *have* to comment on?Contrary (perhaps) to my rating of 5/10 I will say now that I actually enjoyed this movie quite a bit. However, 45 mins of enjoyment out of three something hours ain't a lot. Really.I feel this movie was an odd joining of two completely separate films. One half was a good disaster movie, the other was one of the worst romantic movies I have ever seen.My dad (and another IMDB commenter) has called this 'Romeo and Juliet on the sea'. What an insult! William Shakespeare wrote some of the greatest dialogue ever in that play, and it is probably the best romantic storyline ever. On the other hand, Titanic has some of the most awful dialogue this side of Power Rangers and is so absolutely and utterly cliched I could easily have written it myself. In fact, I'd be willing to bet Jim Cameron had a friend's 5 year old son write the first half of the script. It's that bad.The acting. Hmmmmm. Most of the supporting cast are wonderful (Kathie Bates, Billy Zane, et al) but Kate and Leo have no idea how to handle the romantic leads. Not that they were given much to work with, mind you, so perhaps they're not to be blamed. I doubt even Robert deNiro or Al Pacino (or any other great actor) could really make that trash sound realistic.On the other hand, I enjoyed much of the second half (though not all). It was suspenseful and very moving. The quartet was a wonderful touch, playing as the ship sinks, and there are many other nice moments. But for this bit of nice filmwork to be lumped onto an extraordinarily long piece of crap is a very odd dramatic choice.By the way, I enjoy long movies if they're good. I love things like 'Wyatt Earp', 'The Postman', 'Dances With Wolves'... um, any Costner movie that's long actually. But Titanic was two movies sandwiched together, and that just makes it feel clumsy and drawn out.Finally, the score is very nice, and I do like the tune for 'My Heart Will Go On' which is used in the score, but I hate Celine Dion. That doesn't affect my enjoyment of the score overall though.To conclude the way I began: 5/10",Titanic
1310,edmund-7,great movie,10,23 December 1998,"Many might disagree with me. But I can compare Titanic with Gone with the Wind in terms of their being great movies. Both are love story movies, and both are fractions of two of the most popular historical events.  Gone with the Wind depicts the horror of war, Titanic the horror of a sea disaster, all caused by human lapses. Titanic  is technically flawless, so with Gone with the Wind.Gone with the Wind has already endured the test of time. a classical movie, Titanic will still prove its worth, but surely it will.My point, we should encourage and promote movies like these.",Titanic
1311,Freddy-12,Great Special Effects Do Not A Good Movie Make,2,23 March 1999,"Titanic features one of the worst screenplays ever perpetrated on the moviegoing public.  Unbelievable one-dimensional characters (is the Billy Zane character a joke or what?), banal dialogue, and not an ounce of believable romance in the love scenes.  I found myself bored and waiting for people to die.  Titanic plays like a dark version of the Love Boat.  How can the Academy award it ""Best Picture"" when it didn't even receive a best screenplay award?  And when Kenneth Turan of the L.A. Times pointed out how poor the screenplay was, James Cameron threw an infantile tantrum and tried to get Turan fired.   Decades from now, Hollywood will be embarrassed that they ever honored this live-action cartoon.  But hey, until then, the special effects were nice.",Titanic

1313,LazarusL,A post-pubescent comment,3,26 March 1999,"Dear GOD, this movie amazed me. What amazed me more were the sheep that bought into it, and the little lambs that were allowed in. This is a movie with nudity, sex, violence and some very disturbing images that are not appropriate for young children.Ok, now on to the review. My friend dragged me to this over the march break last year, and I am only now getting past my disappointment to discuss it reasonably. To all those who think it is the greatest movie of all time I would love to know what your criteria is. Do you go by acting? Outside of Kathy Bates and some minor players, there is none. I got about as much emotion out of Leo as I did out of my hampster in her final days. Winslet was bareable, although I cannot comprehend her bearing all, unless James felt that the teen-age male was an important demographic.Now you cannot completely fault the actors, because the script was hardly anything to shout about (unless you are the ranting and raving type.) ""I have seen the iceberg and now I see it in your eyes,"" could not be any more sappy. It was full of little bits of dialogue that were laughably out of historical context, and the characters could not be more cliched... which brings me to the story itself.It was as if someone took all the period pieces about class disparity and jammed them through a meat grinder. All the juice (ie. plot and intrigue) leaked out of the bottom, and a squishy,  messy, mixed up movie was the result. The kind, young, talented pauper falls in love with the rich, testy, unhappy girl who is betroethed to the evil industrialist. Joan Collins would be impressed...Basically, if you want loud noise, and don't mind a few tits, plus you can survive 2 hours of boredom interspersed, this movie is worth it. Otherwise, you haven't hit puberty yet, or you really need to watch some real movies, like Citizen Kane or On the Waterfront.",Titanic
1314,LazarusL,Sit right back and tell you a tale about a terrible film...,3,14 August 1999,"Blech. This movie cheapens both Hollywood and the audience. In fact all it needed was the Backstreet Boys (or one of their equally talentless clones) to make it the perfect piece of pre-adolescent garbage.Qualities: 1. The sets and costumes 2. Kathy Bates, although she is wastedFlaws: 1. The single worst script ever written for a period film. The dialogue seems akward for the 1990s let alone the 1910s. 2. The para-acting. I say para-acting because in some places I am fairly sure that in some seens somebody just picked up a cardboard cut-out of Leo and shook it around. 3. Special effects. The boat was great, but was not simulated. Watch it again and you will see how poorly the blue screening is done. You can actually see that people's faces have been pasted onto dummies in spots. Almost as poorly done as that awful Micheal Keaton snow-man movie. 4. Story. How cliched can a movie get? Charming poor boy rescues rich disillusioned young rich lady betrothed to obnoxious rich man. Gee, how original. I also found it amusing that the Cpt. chose to remain on in the movie when last I heard he got into a lifeboat in real life. 5. That miserable old lady. Why does everyone applaud old ladies who show emotions in movies? They can't help, they are covered with wrinkles. She couldn't act her way out of her own walker. 6.

1315,The Dave-3,"A ""Titanic"" disappointment",1,1 April 1999,"Only once in a great while, does a film of dynamic magnitude and power, grace the silver screen.  Unfortunatly, this is not one of those.  I can sum up the entire film with just ONE word: PRETENTIOUS.  The special effects are among the best I've seen, along with the cinematography and technical poise. This COULD of been a film of immense glory and scope, whisking us away on a beautiful journey, showing us humanity's undying spirit in the face of ultimate disaster.  Instead, James Cameron tries to replay ""Gone With The Wind"" on a ship.  His efforts could have turned it all into a success if the characters weren't about as interesting as cardboard, and if the story was written by someone who didn't flunk 7th grade english.  The on-screen chemistry between DiCaprio and Winslet was laughable at best.  I didn't believe for one second that they even LIKED each other, much less LOVE each other (they were both victims of an over-powering score by James Horner). They just didn't even look right for each other.  Maybe they should have ""beefed-up"" DiCaprio so that he actually weighed over 100 pounds, or just found a different actor all together.  I just want to know what happened to the Leonardo DiCaprio from ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", or ""Basketball Diaries"".  While watching this film, I was wondering if Cameron was holding up cue cards behind the camera by the way he acted.  Kate Winslet was carried by her looks throughout the entire film; she IS gorgeous, but she could have put a little honest energy into the role, instead of it feeling forced out.You have to give it to Cameron, though.  He is a hell of a talented technical director (see ""Aliens"", ""The Abyss"", or the ""Termanitor"" movies), and when it came time to sink the ship, he gave us one hell of a show. All in all, the 45 mintue climax couldn't float this sinking vessel.  How a film like this can win 11 Oscar's, and films of a much higher caliber (like ""Saving Private Ryan"", and ""L.A. Confidential""), get snubbed? Sniff-Sniff...  ...I smell politics.",Titanic
1316,fidget-2,Fantastic!,10,6 April 1999,"I admit, I only wanted to see the ship when I first heard that this movie was coming out. When I actually went and saw it, I was so impressed with absolutely everything. I've been fascinated with the Titanic for years and often wondered what it would have been like to be there. Not for the sinking but to be on the ship. This movie brought me as close to that feeling as I think I'll ever get. Now I know what it would have been like.I'm also impressed at the historical accuracy of the film. It's definitely a tribute to those who perished and the survivors.For anyone who is passing judgement on the film before they see it because Leonardo DiCaprio is in it should get over it and see the film. If you like the Titanic, it's worth it.",Titanic
1317,ben-152,Icebergs aren't the only disaster in this Blockbuster piece of Cinematic Crap,1,19 August 2006,"When I was around 5, Titanic came out and my parents had seen it in theaters and hated it. I, however found a big love for the movie, my friends played Titanic on the playground, my friend owned the video and I eventually saw it, well half of it since I wasn't ready for the distress and peril. As I grew, I learned how cheesy, formulaic and just plain god awful this movie was.To start off, I think that the scenery, costumes and sets are magnificent, and some of the characters give life in their roles (The man who played the Captain, Victor Garber and Kathy Bates) the rest, however are just irritating and trying too hard to make their performance stand out. And they do, just not in a good way. Kate Winslet is just a snobby girl who obviously is misunderstood and wishes her mother would listen to her, Leonardo Dicaprio is just a vile, poor boy who seems an awful lot like a rude and bratty version of Tramp(Who is from a rich girl meets poor boy story that works, ""Lady and the Tramp."") Billy Zane plays Rose's Fiancé, Cal and uses an accent that mocks the British as do most of the other supporting actors. Plus, Cal is convinced that the ship is unsinkable, as is everyone, except Rose who is ""educated"" (apparently knowing who Freud is makes her a smart scholar.) But she's a girl! Why listen to her?! This Ship is Unsinakble! It is she who notices that they're aren't enough lifeboats, but is reassured once again by another man that the ship can't and won't sink. Enoguh on that, let us talk about the main plot.Titanic was a ship that was to sail from Ireland to New York, we all know that. But, it seems that the Director, James Cameron (Who is usually a good director and who redeemed himself with Ghosts of the Abyss.) does not know anything but that small fact, and that many Irish people were in third class. The many wonderful stories about the ship, not that the death of many people is a good thing, but that the tales survivors have passed down about their voyage on the Titanic. If James contacted the few still alive or read a book, he would maybe make this film get two stars for researching the stories of the ships passengers. Anyway, Rose is on the ship with her mother and fiancé, but she is not happy. Jack is a poor boy who wins tickets to the Titanic in a game of poker and lives his life to its fullest. They meat while suicidal Rose is about to jump and Jack won't let her. If this were the real world, any chance that these two would meet, or that she would even come near the third class deck would be very slim. So long story short, he saves her from falling. While doing so, the police hear screams coming from her and when they arrive, it appears that he is raping her. They arrest Jack, but Rose says that he saved her and he goes scotch free. Then, their bond begins.Already, within the first forty five minutes am I bored, waiting for the ship to sink and not center around these two bratty kids who never even existed, but the story makes them as big as the ship itself. So these two become friends and Jack teaches Rose how to live a little, which means he gets her to hock spit and dance at a drunken third class party and escape the upper prestigious class. Soon Rose begins to realize, Do I even love Cal? Is Jack the one for me? He understands her and she understands him, unfortunately her mother disapproves of their romance because he's poor and she's engaged. Rose then tries to end her romance with Jack, but like every other romance movie she goes with the man she just met and apparently the choice was right. They stand on the edge of the ship and ""fly,"" he draws her nude only wearing her necklace Cal gave to her as an engagement present. If you have been living in a cave or hopefully haven't heard of Titanic, these scenes are none as its most memorable, as is their sex scene in the back of a car. Luckily, the iceberg hits and all hell breaks loose. After Cal insisting it won't sink it does! And nobody listen to Rose! Cal wants her, but she says, ""I'd rather be a whore then your wife."" Soon enough, Jack and Rose are together in the water all cold and near death, but they can still churn out cinematic waste. While watching it, I found their love being broken not as important as the many people dying right next to them. And before you know it, Jack dies. It would be pretty obvious because when a disaster occurs, one of the lovers is bound to die. Eventually, selfish Rose is rescued and calls herself Rose Dawson, which makes me laugh. She knows him for two days and then considers their little unimportant romance like marriage, Please. The end is when the diamond the explorers are searching for isn't found, Rose has it, she dumps it over the edge and then meets Jack in heaven. There, I saved you three hours of your life.Adding on to the boring love story, the music sounds like Enya half the time and the rest like music you hear in a Nordstrom's store at the mall(the theme is sung by sea wench Celene Dion another disaster for the film). The script sounds like a dreary English paper using vocabulary words I learned in seventh grade. At least it is when the two lovebirds aren't screaming ""Jack! Jack!"" or ""Rose!!"" The star goes to scenery, and it stays that way.",Titanic

As far as I can see it has no redeeming features at all.  Titanic is too long, boring and the special effects aren't really very special.There is no attempt to develop the characters and the narrative, far from being a great love story, is just silly.  If the script cost more than £1 it was robbery.I saw this with a friend who commented, as the credits revealed ""Written and Directed by James Cameron"", .. and he should be thoroughly ashamed of himself.This is the sort of film that makes Europeans despise Hollywood.

1320,Lil Alex,Why do people hate this film?,10,8 October 1999,"I think people hate this film because they are letting the hype about the film interfere with how they see the film.  Don't judge a film based on outside influences.  Don't hate it because Cameron is an egomaniac.  Don't hate it because 14 year old girls went 20 times just to see Leo.  Don't hate it because they played that song 10 times a day for a year.  Hate it because you hate the movie itself, what was on the screen and that alone. If you but all the hype aside I think you will see a truly great film.  A film that succeeds on many levels.  Special effects, acting, music, action, humor, historical, moral, philosophical.  Did I miss one? I'll admit I love Cameron films.  I don't however typically like ""chick"" flicks, and this is partially a chick flick.  But it is also an ""action"" flick. Does it go on to long.

But all the hype about the real Titanic during that time sure helped it. But looking behind the hype and the historical reference, what do we have, really? Just another fictional love story between two characters that nobody could identify with. C'mon, if it were a story of my real life, I wouldn't want DiCapprio to star in it. He is a one dimensional actor with no real talent, just a ""pretty face"" which only a teenage girl or a confused homo would fall in love with. The other actors were too transparent and unreal. James Cameron was smart using such a clever background and special effects. I've seen it only once in video to see what was all about and fell asleep thru the first 21/2 hours of it. The only good scenes were the sinking of the ship. Why such a crappy movie made so much money? I ill never know but it tells me a lot of the 'American way of life' here. An Oscar for that?

1323,kevmaster2000,The most overrated film ever made,6,19 February 2001,"I went to see this movie after hearing only rave reviews and good things about it.  I thought it must be an unbelievable movie.  I was in for a surprise...Many people still believe that Titanic is the best film ever made.  It's not a particularly bad film...the acting is good and it's arguably well directed. The first half of the movie, the set up of the love triangle, is semi-interesting, but then the second half is different.  They try to make you really care about Jack and Rose and want them to live through the inevitable sinking of the ship.  (That's one thing that bothers me about true stories: you already know what's going to happen...)  The acting was decent, but the characters were not written deeply enough for me to really care whether or not they die.  The second half of the movie is the ship sinking.  Amazing effects on this half.  I guess it did a good job of showing how horrible it must have been to be there, and it was meant to be suspenseful and maybe even scary, but I actually got bored.  The audience was already aware that a lot of people were going to die, but the movie spends about an hour showing the many different ways the sinking of the Titanic could have killed someone.  I remember watching the Academy Awards and thinking, ""Well, Titanic is going to win,"" and everyone else already knew this, but almost everyone agrees with the Academy's choice.  There were many great movies that year: L.A. Confidential and Good Will Hunting were both better movies than this was, in my opinion.  Titanic just didn't hold my interest the way many, many other movies have.  So if you are easily impressed and not a big movie watcher, then you'll probably enjoy this movie.  But to me, it was the most disappointing movie ever.",Titanic

Firstly the undertaking of the moviemaking is ""titanic"" in its own right: the use of submersibles to photograph the wreck thousands of feet down, the massive set that involved building a virtual replica of the great ship.
Secondly I believe it is one of the greats because of the seamless use of movie making technology to bring this great ship to life.
The movie's popularity is found it Cameron's putting a human face on the sinking of this great ship ... the courageous, the cowards ... the wealthy, the paupers.Its only fault is that it is a bit long. Could have used an intermission! I rank it a ""10"".Jim Peet",Titanic
1326,fwillie14,"A commercial success, dishonor to cinema",7,22 August 2000,"Titanic is a comercial movie, who couldn't be worst in a film making. All what James Cameron searches is showing Leonardo Di Caprio in all the ways possible to make a Calendar. Titanic is a too simple story for such a good theme and such a good budget. I hate simple words and simple stories.",Titanic
1327,amira_berzi,"nice sinking, bad love story",6,29 August 2000,"After reading the other comments, I was glad there is such a common consent and unanimity on the fact that the part about the ship was good while the plot, particularly the love story, was naive and boring.   Even the dialogue is interesting and relatively witty in the parts about the ship and the characters other than Jack and Rose, while all conversation between the two lovers is boring and naive.  I am surprised there wasn't much effort in creating a more mature and deeper love story, especially with the effort put in the movie as a whole.  James Cameron  did a very good job directing the ship and her sinking, characters like Moly Brown were amusing but there was nothing special about the main characters.  I wonder what was behind the choice of Leonardo DiCaprio for that role, given his young look (One expected a more mature looking man). I would advise people to watch it and appreciate the technical effects but with low expectations of the plot.",Titanic
1328,Sister Moon-2,"Incredible Story of Love, Death, and Immortality...",10,18 December 2000,"I saw this movie during its original 1997 release and I vowed never to see it again- not because it was a bad movie, but because it was the most incredibly moving film I had ever seen.  I couldn't bring myself to cry at the theater for fear that I wouldn't stop.  So, I went home and cried for two hours- after the late show.  I found this film riveting, not just for the story itself, but for the brutally honest imagery James Cameron used to depict the tragedy and torture of death and dying.  Granted, most of it was special effects- AMAZING special effects!- but I couldn't say that the trauma of the sinking could have stayed with me had they spent less money and used a cheaper outlet of film making.  In the end, I wasn't thinking about the money, the commercialization, or the pretty face of Leonardo...I was aching inside for the 1500 needless deaths, cast out to freeze in the icy water of the Atlantic.One last thing.  About a year after I saw this film, I attended the Titanic Exhibit in Minneapolis, and my eye happened to catch something on open display in what appeared to be a large sand box.  I walked over to it and there was a sign on the front which said, ""Please Touch.""  So, I reached out and put my hand on the large, spatula shaped object, rusted from years of decay.  It was then that I realized I was touching a boat davit recovered from the wreckage of the Titanic, and, in unison with this realization, a man came over to the display and put his hand on the davit next to mine. Then, he looked at me, and in a very small voice, said, ""May God have been with them.""  I burst into tears.",Titanic
1329,chegevera,"Simple, predictable,and awful",1,8 March 2001,"Titanic is probably one of the worst films of the 90's. Cameron must've sold his soul to the devil for it to get an academy award. To be thought of as a better movie over than As Good As It Gets or Good Will Hunting. THIS WILL GIVE AWAY THE ENDING! One of the things I hated most about this film is the predictability. From the first time she met Jack, I knew he was going to Die. It was so easy to forsee. I also hate how much of a copy this was of almost every simple romance story, Girl about to marry snob, meets slightly poor, funny guy, falls in love, something prevents, then at end they are together. It was probably as simple as it gets. I also hate how farfetched the plot was. If Cameron had done ANY research prior to writing it, he would have realized how a romance like that would have NEVER happened. During 1910's American & England people married and dated within their economic class. I also hate this film because it was so shallow, unlike past Academy Award Best Picture Winners, Titanic had NO societal meaning, No symbolism, and No Metaphors. Usually after watching films bestowed with that honor, you feel changed, different, with Titanic I was just disappointed.Lastly the acting was poor, at best, except for that of Billy Zane's, which was phenomenal. They picked actors singularly for looks rather than acting ability. Winslet showed little to no emotion, and Decaprio could never pull off any of the sad scenes. I truly hated this film, second to STRANGERS IN GOOD COMPANY, this is one of the worst films ever. No One should see this film.",Titanic
1330,guster-1,Titanic must be turning in it's grave,5,28 April 2006,"For the life of me I still don't get why people like this film. It's got nearly every type of film cliché(rich girl falls in love with boom town rat, hmmm, original!), and THAT song. Near far, wherever you are, Celine Dion's song irritates the hell out of me. I think if you're going to make a film about Titanic, make a film about Titanic, not some annoying couple. I like romantic movies, don't get me wrong, but this is too cheesy and simple, which love invariably isn't. In it's defence though, I would like to comment on the fact that the special effects department did a splendid job, but unfortunately I like my films to have a good and varied plot which this film totally lacks. The Titanic was a great ship, ahead of it's time and was a icon of it's time, which makes this film an absolute travesty as it doesn't do Titanic's memory any justice.",Titanic

1332,W_L,A modern-day classic,8,17 March 2001,"Getting past the fact that Leo is way too young looking for Kate, this really was a great modern film.  Every time I see it, I find something new to like about it.  Knowing the ending before going in (from a historical perspective) does not dampen the excitement that leads up to the inevitable. Costumes are divine, and although Kate overacts (kinda sounds like a breathless Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz occasionally), the acting is believable.  The recreation of the Titanic is amazing.  Considering this is not the typical film I would enjoy (I tend to avoid over-blown Hollywood ""blockbusters""), it was extremely enjoyable.",Titanic
1333,Pinklady10,A tragic love story set on the famous Titanic ship,10,27 October 2006,"I first saw this movie while living out in Cyprus, and I loved it. Everything about it was fantastic, I didn't want it to end. The cast was great, I thought Kathy Bates was perfect as Molly Brown, but Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet were terrific as Jack Dawson and Rose Dewitt Bukater, they had me on the edge of my seat, I was almost crying by the end of it, and I sure i'm not the only one, thanks to Leonardo's magnificent performance. The grand staircase was my favourite part of the ship, it was beautiful, every tiny detail just took my breath away. I have watched this film so many times now, but I still can't get enough of it. From the incredible sets, to the amazing costumes, this film is truly magical,",Titanic
1334,FlickJunkie,An epic in every sense of the word.,10,2 August 2001,"""Titanic"" has a large number of fans that will cheerfully proclaim that it is the best movie ever made, and a large number of detractors who will cheerfully proclaim that is nothing but overrated garbage. I just feel it is a great film. ""Titanic"" definitely deserved the Best Picture Oscar in 1997 and to describe ""Titanic"" as overrated garbage and the worst movie ever made says something about that person, that they are ignorant about films or just ignorant and only hate it because it's the highest grossing movie of all time. I admit that when it was becoming that I hated it before even seeing it because I didn't want it to be. Now I have seen it three times (not once in theaters) since it was released, and it still manages to keep me glued to the screen for all three hours.James Cameron's recreation of the 1912 sinking of the ""unsinkable"" liner is one of the most magnificent pieces of serious popular entertainment ever to emanate from Hollywood. The gargantuan production cost--estimated at about $200 million--has been spent on sumptuous, stunningly believable sets and visual effects, giving the viewer the feeling of being a passenger on the ill-fated voyage. But the three-hours-plus ""Titanic"" ultimately succeeds so powerfully in retelling this familiar story because it is an intimate epic with a moving and resonant love story at its core. The performances by all the cast are outstanding, even the hundreds, possibly thousands of extras. Once again Kate Winslet proves that she is one of the most talented actress of her generation. Her small steps from repressed, snobbish rich girl, to passionate, joyful and full of life, are very subtle, yet we always know that she is changing -- we can feel what she feels. Any actor or actress who can do that is very special indeed. She also manages to pull off a mostly convincing American accent. Leonardo DiCaprio is very good as well, as Jack, the steerage passenger-artist who wins tickets for Titanic at a poker game. His character is always alive, and is the catalyst for Rose's transformation. The chemistry between the two of them is great; their scenes together are special to watch. This all coming from someone who really can't stand Leonardo DiCaprio.The film does a remarkable job of contrasting the stiff haughtiness of the upper class with the joyful energy of the steerage class. One scene in particular stands out, as Cameron cuts between 1st-class men talking politics in the dining room and 3rd-class passengers having the time of their lives below decks, dancing up a storm. The film's technical aspects are amazing. The sets and costumes look so much like the real thing that the viewer gets a sense of deja-vu (at least those who study the Titanic). The special effects are totally believable. The effects are so good that people might think they are seeing reality, and not effects. They're that good.
The music by James Horner is perfect in all the right places. The script by Cameron is very good, haunting and quite witty. There are dozens of details written into the script, either about the characters or about the ship. All of them point to something down the line. Cameron's script is filled with the most subtle foreshadowing. The only thing that I caught which struck a false note was the fact that Jack always seemed to be on the 1st-class deck, when in fact steerage was not allowed to mingle with the 1st-class. However that is a minor complaint, for the rest of the film is very accurate. Even though the film is three hours long, it seems much shorter; I didn't look at the clock even once during all three viewings. The last hour is a dazzler, both visually and emotionally. I felt myself clinging to the seat hoping the ship would miss that iceberg and choking up about once or twice during the film. And finally, what surprises me about the user ratings is that compared to any other film in the IMDb top 250 this film compares in the number of twos through tens, it just has so many unfair ones (almost as many as the number of nines) that it is kept from being in the IMDb top 250 and really makes you wonder.Rating: 10/10",Titanic

The party is ruined and there's not enough boats.I'm not going to spoil the end, but i'll leave you with a question...Will the titanic sink?

1340,freezephyr,A good film in spite of itself,10,3 June 2002,"John H. FreemanThe only reason I am writing a commentary on this film is to provide a note at the top of the heap that this film is, with all due respect to its box office record and glorious showing at the Oscars, a rip-off of one of the earliest, and indeed one of the finest of all disaster films. I am not referring to the 1953 film of the same title but to ""A Night to Remember"". Camron's ""Titanic"" is and most likely will remain a film steeped in critical controversy. It certainly will survive in spite of itself. This is primarily due to having some particularly good characteristics of successful film-making. The right formula for the right audience, delivered at the right time. However, if you truly want to see a stunning film on the Titanic tragedy, and are not hung up about the special effects needed to make a successful movie as are many movie goers these days, see ""A Night to Remember"". It is in every aspect a superior film. Totally unpretentious and never over the top. If you have seen ""Titanic"", you will gasp at every ripped off scene and wonder how the producers of ""Titanic"" ever got away with not giving credit where credit is due.",Titanic

It went down with the boat, with numerous places where the fiction over road the fact and the history of the event, as well as the design of the boat, were forgotten. I've spoken with many history buffs about this movie and they were all appalled, siting instances when the movie was incorrect. One case, the director chose to leave out one of the smoke stacks for aesthetic appeal. Leonardo was charming and Kate was beautiful, but they were perhaps the only redeeming qualities of this movie. A tragic event to make a profit from, I think.",Titanic
1342,justinsubscribe,A movie for the ages,10,16 May 2003,"When I watched the movie,  I had very limited knowledge of what went on on that ill-fated voyage. Therefore, I was definitely moved when James Cameron showed in remarkable detail the tragedy which occured. DiCaprio and Winslet gave wonderful performances. No other actors during that time would probably have had the charisma and talent to pull it off like they did. The film was impressive in the way it captures the look of old Titanic film and its overall epic quality.If you like love and romance, and enjoy excellent filmmaking, like the countless  people who made this the biggest selling movie of all time, this is the movie for the ages. On the other hand, if you don't like romance and/or the type who likes nit-picking every flaw in a movie (as some of my friends and some of the reviewers who gave this film a one), you probably won't.10 out of 10",Titanic

At this point in time, it is unrealistic to portray a woman to not to the 'right' thing -- marry for money, status and protect her own family -- for love of Leonardo di Caprio of all people.

1345,nouseforaname,a movie you're not allowed to dislike...,5,14 September 2004,"Apparently, I think this is the movie with the most ""people only dislike it because its cool to"" reviews I've ever seen, unbelievable, is this the way grown people are supposed to act when faced with differencing opinions? I don't bash people who like it and excuse their opinions as meaningless.I was 12 when this movie came out and of course, although I don't like to admit it, had a small crush on Leo DiCaprio. This was a international(intergalactic maybe even) phenomenon in 97, it was on every mans lips and everyone seemed .to .love .it . I even remember a particular episode of the Oprah Winfrey show around this time where she had the actors and such from the movie and actually condemned people who hadnt seen it yet, calling them crazy, this was funny to me because I hadnt yet seen it. When I finally went to see it, people were bawling their eyes out all over the place, with the occasional odd comment from the younger audience(one small child said it sounded like DiCaprio had the hiccups as he was laying in the freezing water, dying).Even then, I didn't see what all the hype was about, of course I didn't say this to anyone, fearing for my life, this movie was, as someone said, bigger than god. Although in my innocent opinion it was a solid flick, the main theme, the love story, on the other hand, hated it, I would have much rather watched anyone else on the ship than those two. And yes this despite my little crush, it was just very nonsensical and uninteresting in my pre-teen mind. I just didn't believe that these two could evolve a relationship like that in what, 2 days?Seeing it again a few years later, I've come to see how terribly flawed the writing is above all else, and plot wise, especially that which involves the two love birds(like there's much of anything else).This movie isn't a masterpiece in my opinion, nor is it the worst movie ever made.",Titanic

Not only will it stand the test of time, but it will remain in the hearts of many people throughout the world.This movie is so touching and moving that it makes you want to start balling right in front of everyone. Not only that, but it takes you on a thrill ride which will be unforgettable. The acting in this film is absolutely superb and could not have been any better. The casting was selected so perfectly and carefully that it could not have gone wrong. And of course the director, James Cameron, is without a doubt one of the most amazing directors I've ever seen. He manages to make you cry, but at the same time is able to keep your heart racing. Not many directors can pull this off.Another factor in this film which makes it so outstanding is the music. The music is very diverse in different parts of the movie. James Horner did an amazing job with the overall score. It can be either very suspenseful, or very soft and enlightening. And I don't know about you but when Celine Dion starts singing, there is no way that you can keep tears from staying in your eyes.Okay sure this film can make you cry, we know this. But this is one of the only love stories to date to absolutely horrify people. Some of the scenes where the ship is sinking are horrendous. The visual effects are exceptional for a 1990's film. They really do look real and create effects which are shocking to watch.Many people disagree that this is a remarkable movie just because it is not completely factual. Well guess what? Get over it. It was not made to be 100% accurate alright. It was meant to show the deep passion between two lovers and there willingness to save each others lives. For all you haters out there, we all know that you force your horrible opinions about a movie just so that you feel special. I mean who are you trying to kid? I know, you know, and America knows that this is one of the most mesmerizing and astonishing films ever made. This is an honorable movie and deserved each and every award that it got.I cannot tell you how much a cherish this film and all of its glory. It is an absolute necessity for any movie collection and is a landmark and role model for any good film to come. Not very many films will ever top it. If this film does not get your heart racing then you don't have one at all. And if this film does not move you as much as it moved me, then you don't know what a good movie is. It will go down in history as one of those epic movies. One that will never be forgotten. And all the haters, don't worry you'll come to your senses one day. Overall, a complete 10 out of 10.

1348,benfield-larry09,A Titan of film making,8,8 April 2013,"James Cameron re-invents the epic big cast disaster films of the 70's with grand style. To begin with as a Titanic buff since my early childhood I was astonished the first time I saw this film. The extreme accuracy and detail of the ship is extraordinary. The original shipbuilding firm Harland and Wolff participated in the construction of the sets and models used in the film. When you see this film you are seeing the Titanic as it was on sailing day.As for the story, both Dicaprio and Winslet provide excellent performances as Jack and Rose. Their star crossed story is deeply interwoven in the Titanic mythology that is both fact and legend. Through their experiences we are allowed to explore the Titanic in ways never presented on film. Many of the ship's iconic locations are seen in the film and the recent Blu-ray edition brings the film into glorious high definition 1080hd format.Cameron's excellent use of lighting, camera angles and visual effects allow us to feel almost there both visually and emotionally during the final phases of the film that come close in timing to the actual sinking. The film leaves us both sad and hopeful at the same time and few films provide us with such dual emotions.If you like love stories, this film is for you, if you have any interest in the Titanic or disaster movies then the film will appeal to those audiences as well. Most importantly it is a entertaining ride by one of the best film makers of this generation and I recommend anyone to give the film a try and judge for yourself.",Titanic

The emotional and mental growth of the characters so splendidly predictable. And most of the lower-class folk were the healthiest and best looking I'd ever seen.It's a nostalgic return to the old days of Hollywood, when it was clear who the goodies were and who the baddies were, and when everyone had perfect teeth.Bit like a modern Casablanca...except it's in colour...and takes 90 minutes longer, and...er... is considerably less witty...but still, I have a great value for it.Yes, yes, it's true that I dozed off and on, off and on, watching it the first time at the cinema. But I must point out that I was feeling particularly tired that day, and it had nothing whatsoever to do with the fact that sleeping through it in ten-minute blocks made no difference to my ability to work out what was going on.

1350,jmm61850,Lacks Substance!,6,19 March 2005,"This 1997 movie, ""Titanic"", does a wonderful job at recreating the maritime disaster that struck this mighty passenger ship on its maiden voyage. However, the fictional story of the kindling, but doomed romance of a very unlikely couple is totally unbelievable. Decaprio delivers an adequate performance, but he is unfortunately miscast. Never once did I believe, the sophisticated and mature beauty played by Winslet would ever be romantically interested in someone who looked like a common and mischievous high school boy. This budding romance never rang true; thus, I found it exceedingly difficult to become emotionally involved when their inevitable demise was at hand. The only redeeming value of this movie was its special effects and the long drawn out sinking scenes. And of course, that's what this movie was supposed to be about anyway.",Titanic

On the other hand, it is also a love story, which feels like Romeo and Juliet on a boat, but with social class struggles instead of family feuding. As a history movie, Titanic is a top-20 film, but as a love story it falls flat for me. Call me heartless, but this movie did not affect me. I enjoyed DiCaprio and Winslet in the film, but I felt their roles weren't fully developed, because the film had two focuses.

1353,beuchertk,Cornpone and really bad history,1,1 July 2014,"The sinking of the Titantic is actually quite interesting, as anyone who has read a well-written book about the event can tell you. This film tosses away that story and replaces it with a cornball teeny bop-per love story that makes one want to puke, all the while slandering historical figures (like J Bruce Ismay, whom James Cameron has falsely portrayed as a prototypical heartless and cowardly businessman) and some others unfortunate enough to be a target of Cameron's biases. In the end, Cameron's film so far removed from reality that it's unlikely anything it contains would ever be taken seriously by anyone looking for the historical facts. I mean, when was the last time Hollywood presented real history? Probably 1964 when they filmed The Longest Day, whose script was religiously close to Cornelius Ryan's book. Since then, not much. The fact that Cameron had to make up a subplot wouldn't have been so bad, had it remained a subplot to the story of the sinking, and had it been realistic rather than such a trite piece of romantic nonsense. Cameron had the opportunity to make a definitive account of this well-known event and totally blew it. To tell history you need someone who is dedicated to historical truth, not someone determined to make the audience reach for their collective handkerchiefs. Shame on you, Mr. Cameron. What a colossal waste.",Titanic
1354,mattreviews,Kate Winslet is a goddess of the screen,7,22 January 2005,"Being such a popular film at the time of its release, I was skeptical whether Titanic was going to be of any worth. Over 8 years after it hit the big screen, I finally sat down and find out what all the hype was about. Titanic is a romance of epic proportions, and although we all kind of know what happens in the end, the three hours plus seemed to fly by.The opening scenes of exploration of the Titanic at the bottom of the ocean, 84 years after it sank, is intriguing footage, and Bill Paxton does well in the part of the main researcher, even though anyone really could have done the role with ease. It is when we get to main story, with a 101 year old Rose DeWitt Bukater reminiscing of her time on the Titanic, that the film really begins.Essentially a story of love, Titanic also deals with the class system and politics of the early 1900s, with Leonardo DiCaprio being the drifting artist who comes to met the well-to-do Kate Winslet on board the ship. From there on, it's business as usual: Winslet's character Rose is smitten by DiCaprio's Jack Dawson, but is to marry another, a well-off man named Caledon Hockley, played exceptionally well by Billy Zane. Rose and Jack fall in love, Zane finds out and seeks vengeance  it's all been done before. What makes this film unique is the setting of the story: the Titanic on its first  and last  voyage from England to America. Lives are lost but love is not, and it this eternal love that is depicted in the film that resonates with the audience. The true highlight of the film is Kate Winslet, with a traditional beauty, ideal for the role of Rose. She is stunning to watch, engages you in a trance with those round eyes, full lips and perfect body, straight out of a Renoir painting. I couldn't take my eyes off her! Titanic does not falter, with a great mix of drama and romance, along with insight into the way of thought back in those days. The film is dramatized for effect  it looked like a lot more that 1200 odd people in the water  but that's expected for a big blockbuster of a flick, and so I didn't hold it against James Cameron, who fulfilled his need to tell the story of an amazing adventure that did, in fact, happen not so long ago, and history always helps to captivate viewers.",Titanic
1355,hashem1983,A Timeless masterpiece,10,13 September 2021,"I got to say I was so obsessed with the movie the moment I saw it the first time in the cinema in June 1998 until I had the chance to watch it again in March 1999 on VHS and since then I kept watching it again and again up until this moment.I wasn't only fascinated about the film but with the subject as well, up until this day I keep learning new information about the vessel and the White Star Line company. It was the portal or the main reason to learn more about Titanic besides being entertained by the story of Jack and Rose.The film itself is magical, up to date, in every scene. The mixture of the cinematography with the score, art direction, costume design, visual and sound effects in almost every scene makes it so wonderful.I am always amazed the moment when Old Rose starts her story and then the ship comes back to life in Southampton port, to the moment when she leaves port, when being at sea and then crossing the Atlantic Ocean. Giving the feeling how grand Titanic was until reaching the night before hitting the iceberg you would start to feel something wrong is about to happen. Although I have reached the point where I have memorized the movie by heart, when it's about to collide with the iceberg I keep wondering would they ever pass it? As I mentioned, the music has a major role in every scene of this spectacular motion picture.The sinking part has also its moments, and even though it's been over 100 years on its sinking but I couldn't help myself feeling bad about it, not just the ship, but the people that was carrying them with their dreams to start a new life in another country just to die in the freezing water of the North Atlantic.",Titanic
1356,bgsfrk,A Movie of Titanic proportions,10,19 February 2005,"When I first saw this movie way back in 1997, I was in awe at the ground breaking special effects. This was the most expensive movie done up to its time. I'm not sure if it is anymore(Lord of the Rings)but it definitely stands the test of time. There are scenes in this movie that are timeless and unforgettable. Who can forget Leo's ""King of the world!"" scene, or Kate Winslets ""Never let go.."" scene. No one, at least no one who has seen the film. The acting in the film is spectacular and Kate and Leo are the perfect pair. There are certain things in the film that movie buffs like myself might find a little displeasing. The dialog has been dumbed down so that people of this day and age could understand what the characters were saying, secondly the title Titanic may be a little misleading. This movie, though based highly on the ship, can't help but steer away from the point of the movie. No one can disagree that Titanic is in most part a love story and stories about people sailing on the Titanic. But even with these minor follies, it never stopped me from buying the tape and watching it countless times, to buying the DVD and watching it countless times. This movie hit me into a four year obsession with the Titanic. All I read were Titanic books, and watch Titanic movies. I know anything and everything about the Ship and this movie surpasses my expectations. It is a must see. Filled with action, romance, comedy, and awesome special effects; Titanic is a must see.",Titanic
1357,mathewazaria,Great film!,10,5 September 2018,Great emotional impact held by a sweep-you-off-your-feet epic romance and disaster movie. You can not get any better than this. What really made this movie matter was one thing: it launched the A-list acting careers of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. DiCaprio saw the role's potential when offered it and has had an impressive career since due to his stellar performance here. Winslet campaigned heavily for the role she got it and the same thing happened to her where her stellar performance brought about an impressive career. Give this one a try and see if you like it. I hope you do. Also I hope you can get past the displays of artistic license taken with some of the historical facts. Hope you have fun watching any movie you choose to watch because that's what movies are for. It's the art of entertainment.,Titanic
1358,Pas2leo53,"Terrible, overrated, tired",1,12 April 2005,"This movie began the sad trend of turning tragedies into love stories. After Titanic came Pearl Harbor. It really is getting sad. The only good part of this movie is the sinking of the ship. The CG in that part is really good, but really, was this that great of a movie? No. To prove this, one must only look at its theme song. Tired already? After hearing ""You'll be in my heart"" for the 1,496th time (yes, I really did count. I was really bored one month), i got really tired of it, to say the least. It is unbearably long, and undeservedly so. Unlike LOTR: ROTK, which was a truly epic movie, this movie just seemed to drag on. And what was with the dropping of the necklace into the ocean? Yes, it was symbolic, but really, that thing was worth millions!Anyways, if you are considering watching this movie, just forget it and go rent something meaningful, like the Godfather, or any of the LOTR movies, some truly GREAT movies. Or if you are looking for a laugh, get Thumbtanic. That was pretty funny, and it will basically give you a shorter, more intelligent overview of the Titanic than this movie did.",Titanic

I suggest you check the trivia of the movie to understand that this movie deserves all the Oscars it got and more. It is a timeless movie, with strong acting. I've heard people complain bout the acting of the main actors, but without strong acting the movie would have never succeeded as much as it did. Leonardo DiCaprio was born for the role of Jack Dawson, he makes the audience fall in love with him rapidly, and not just because of his looks. Kate Winslet represents well the role of a young girl in need of freedom. Everything about the movie was outstanding. The setting is a very similar replica too the actual RMS Titanic. It is very realistic since several characters did in fact exist. The special effect are great, seeing in 3D must be quite the experience. The music, My Heart Will Go On, also one of my favorite songs. I don't believe there is anything bad to say other than ""Why did Jack have to die? couldn't they write a happy ending? why make people sad when you have the power to make them cry of joy instead? I love you Jack! Rose don't let go of Jack!"" Once you overcome the extreme feeling of sadness and anger because Jack was too nice and died, you realize that the movie is amazing. PERFECT in every sense of the word.",Titanic
1361,devon_bolen,James Cameron at his best!,9,1 September 2021,"The cultural impact of this film cannot be denied. It became the highest grossing movie of all time (a record it held for 12 years), swept the Oscars with 11 Academy Award wins and was universally praised by critics and audiences alike. Yet somehow over time, like all things popular, it has become ""cool"" to hate on this film. But those people are only doing themselves a serious disservice.The pacing is perfect for its length, the performances are Oscar worthy and it features some of the most impressive and breakthrough special effects of the Era. You can put Titanic toe to toe with any modern day blockbuster and it will give it a run for its money. The perfect blending of state of the art cgi and breathtaking practical effects are executed so seamlessly you forget it's almost 25 years old. This was James Cameron's love child and you can feel his passion for it bursting from the screen.Spectacle aside, none of this would matter if the central characters weren't believable. But Jack and Rose's Romeo and Juliet romance is the glue that keeps the film on course. Played to perfection by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslett, it brilliantly encapsulates how the people you meet, even for however brief a time, can shape you into the person you become. To dismiss this movie as simply a melo dramatic romance is a serious discredit to one of the greatest film makers of all time at the top of his game. Its a careful examination of two vastly different social classes and the hypocrisy that exists between the two.It paints a vivid display of how mans hubris lead to the death of over 1500 people. And the last hour is still some of the most powerful and gut wrenching ever put to film. With imagery that stays in your mind decades later. It's a poignant snapshot of American history that adds gravitas to the events that transpired on that fateful night of April 15, 1912. And unabashedly displays how many lives could've been saved if those in positions of power didn't abuse it. No matter how many times I watch it it will never lose its impact. Titanic was and is a cinematic masterpiece for the ages and a film everyone should experience.",Titanic
1362,Georgeprknight,Not the Titanic film your expecting!,9,19 June 2014,"When they announced this for a film being released. I thought, oh crap! Any average Titanic film, would be very seriously overrated and very cheesy. But when this film came out, I watched it and I loved it! It was so good, that it was worth going to watch it again! This film is definitely worth watching!! The romance scenes are filmed and acted out very well, because when Rose and Jack kiss, it really brings out the emotion. It will express what your feeling, and will make you want to cry! When they're escaping from the flooding of the ship because the Titanic is sinking, words which Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet said in that scene which really isn't necessary. Like the fact that they kept on using the word sh*t! The word is well overused in the entire film, and that is what lets me down. It could have been even better! But the script writing lacked like it was rushed! The CGI is really effective in the studio, actually making it look like that it is sinking. Especially for a 90s film! Some scenes were just not necessary, like the scenes which the old gran was telling the story. Why can't it all be set back in 1912?Overall it is a fantastic film, and definitely worth seeing!My score is a 9.3/10",Titanic

Once again, Hollywood does its best at taking a terrible tragedy and turning it around to be a love story. You either liked this movie for its effects and love story or you hated because of its depiction. Fist Titanic, then pearl harbor. Next, it will be on 9/11. I would like to see how America responds to a 9/11 love story. Trust me, they will do it within a few years.

My BD played all the way through, from beginning to end without any issues OTHER THAN one small freeze up between a particular chapter change. I don't think I lost more than a second or two. It could have had something to do with the issues people were talking about or just dust on the disk or a smudge. Either way I'm not complaining. It did not interrupt my movie experience and I continue to love this movie. So glad that I can own it in such high definition. It looks and sounds great. You see every detail of every scene like never before. They really went out of their way to make this as clean as possible, and we're talking about a movie that came out in the late 90's. Oh! And the commentaries and special features are great, STILL haven't gotten through all of them. Maybe I'll do that now...enjoy.",Titanic
1365,loafer2,Titanic Disaster!,5,3 August 2005,"This is one of those films that was so over-rated when it was first released it is not even funny. It is very interesting to note that even though this film garnered so many Academy Awards, you don't see it on any critic's top ten list and it's not even in this site's top 250! How could this be, you ask? The answer is that this is a classic example of people over reacting to the greatness of a film before really looking deeply into it. This is not even a remotely accurate portrayal of events that occurred during the Titanic's tragic maiden voyage. Instead, it is just a bunch of tripe put together by an action director. You can tell, there are many out of place witty moments that simply do not belong in a film such as this. The characters were annoying and two dimensional and you felt no compassion at all when these people were sinking out at sea. Actually, these people were a bunch of arrogant jerks that deserved to die! The film simply did not show enough of the poor people in the under decks to even give a damn about them, they just showed far too much of Jack and Rose in all their silly Blue Lagooniness.This film really did have potential, it really did, and it's not even all bad. The second half of the film with the boat sinking is some of the best action ever to be put on film. But this was not enough to save this film from sinking into mediocrity. I have to give James Cameron props for trying his skillful hand at drama, but man, go back to making action films--that is definitely your strong suit.",Titanic
1366,wowlover-80667,Amazing movie!!!,10,5 April 2015,"Being seen as one of the greatest movies in Hollywood, this film deserves well over ten stars. The cast members perfectly match their historical/fictional characters; Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson, Kate Winslet as Rose DeWitt Bukater, Billy Zane as Caledon Hockley and many more. The storyline is epic and romantic at the same time, and the script is very well written. James Cameron has done a great job bringing the disastrous story of Titanic back to life and giving it a romance between the two main characters. I must say, Leo DiCaprio has perfected his deaths.

Great, I could have done a 30 second skit of this movie on Facebook for Christ Sake. Why is this movie so popular, please someone explain to me? If you want to see true love destroyed right in front of your eyes, I can help you find that. Just hit up a 4am bar and watch the Titanics sink right in front of your eyes!I feel bad for Leo as this flick really destroys his legacy. He is a much better actor than he shows in this flick. He has no one to blame but his agent, why would his agent set him up to play in this TrashCan of a movie!? Leo you are better than this, if I was your agent I would never have set this up for you. I am sorry on behalf of your agent.Timeout.... Did these two just meet on the ship for the first time!? They fell in love on this ship after a short amount of time. Stop it. I thought these two knew each other since they were like 3 or something. I had this movie rated a 4, but once I confirmed this major detail it was very easy for me to bump down to a 2.

1368,snakeguy76,The four stars is a gift,4,5 January 2006,"OK this movie was out for two months when I saw this so maybe my expectations was a little high, but with all the hype and money spent making it, it should have been high. This movie would have been better if it was just about the sinking. I like love stories but sticking in corny old love story - rich girl doesn't want to marry rich jerk but instead falls in love with the bohemian artist - boy how original. It took away form the great sinking. I got tired of them running though the water. Cameron does not have a knack for writing good dialog.Some other parts made no sense - why would billy Zanes character go through this whole thing about stealing the diamond? the boat is sinking and they locking him up in a room? What is wrong here? And the worst plot twist that will forever make me hate this movie is the diamond. She keeps the diamond all these years and decides that tossing it into the ocean 70 years later was the right course of action? What the ""beep""! First of all it was given to her by her fiancé. He was a jerk but if she didn't love him she should have given it back. INstead she hides form everyone and pretends she dies and hold onto the diamond. Why throw it in? That diamond had a long history long before she ever got it and she just got the thing. Now it will forever be trapped at the bottom of the sea. It might have made sense if it was Dicaprio who gave it to her, but it was Billy Zane.Oh man I can go on and one about what annoyed me about this movie.But this is just my opinion. I know there are many who loved it. But tossing the diamond is not an opinion its just plain WrONG",Titanic
1369,tambourine33,Could have been better,5,12 November 2005,"I think this film is one of those, that you are afraid to criticise because fans will lynch you. On the other hand saying you like it is not the coolest thing to say, especially for a twenty-something male, like myself. So here goes.The film's strengths are the scale of the film, the romance element and Kate Winslet. The sheer size of this film is breathtaking and the attention to detail, which could have so easily been overlooked, eases the path of the audience into the decadence of the era. Trapped in amongst the whirlwind is the story of two star crossed teenagers (tm) falling in love and one sacrificing himself for the love of his life. Kate Winslet is impressive a feisty, red-haired, buxom, rich girl who is trapped by a domineering boyfriend (Zane) but her leading actor, to me at least, fails to match up.Leonardo di Caprio is a good actor but looks like a little boy playing with grown ups and does not come across as a leading man, especially for a movie of this size. Billy Zane puts in a decent show as the caddish bad guy but lacks a foil of equal stature. After all Di Caprio is after his girl and to be quite honest it reminded me of the time I had a crush on a friend's older sister.Another fault in the film came from the dialogue. It's clunky, over the top and made most of the actors look uncomfortable. The ""salt of the earth"" steerage passengers looked hammed up and during the sinking it all got a bit 'wishy washy' all over.It does OK for something to watch with your love-interest but all the time you'll be left sitting there waiting for a)the boat to sink b)Di Caprio to die and c)the end credits.",Titanic

It immidiently made my 100 favorite movies of all time list, and I could see why it remained the top movie at the box office for a record 15 consecutive weeks, and even more so why it became the top grossing movie of all time by early 1998. And though I did not see the March, 1998 Oscars, I knew it was going to win the record 11 it did, and could see why it had been nominated for a record 14 (especially Best Picture, Director, and all the technical awards it did then win). It gave a very good account of the real life tragedy of the Titanic, as well as integrating the real life people on board, but its highlight was wrapping this around the fictional love story, and relationship triangle, which was at the center of its plot. Its pace and direction continues seamlessly from the opening modern day scene until the end, and I could never once tell it was over three hours long (and its climax is very exciting, realistic, and brings everything together).

Well, apparently James Cameron has, he recycled the entire movie and decorated it with a few pretty faces and called it Titanic.  Or how about that wonderful score by James Horner? Didn't we hear the same stuff for BRAVEHEART.  Don't get me wrong I like Horner but, he's only written three soundtracks in his life, he just recycles them to fit other movies. Winslet and DiCaprio got away with sleepwalking through this film, both are capable of a whole lot more but I won't deny them their moment in the sun. Don't get me wrong, I liked Titanic, it's an enjoyable movie but I think the praise is a little over the top.  Cameron is not fit to lace Steven Spielberg's boots when it comes to directing and it's tragic that in a world with Morgan Freeman that anyone with a brain can mention Leo as the best actor in the world.  .  .I'm talking to all you teenage girls out there!

The special effects were the best we can do at this time (Wait 'till you see Star Wars though!) and the acting was OK, but the story was a disgrace. Portraying the ship's first officer as a murderous villain is a travesty! He was actually one of the few crew members who knew what was going on after the captain went barmy.

The effects were good (Not Star Wars good, but good) and I like Kate Winslet (as long as she remains fully clothed) but the story was sorely lacking.  My thirteen-year old sister could have come up with that plot.  In addition, it was approximately 17 hours long.

Yeah,it won special effects adwards.NO acting or screenwriting.And it won best picture because adolescent teens would boycott them if it didn't.Do you REALLY want to see a movie adored by TEENAGERS!? Face it,only a few people have good taste,so popular things stink to high heaven. Don't see it,because if you do you'll be labeled as a sheep in my school(You hear that? School. We Lamar people hate this movie.)I AM NOT A SHEEP!",Titanic
1386,panzerss,Once More Into Movie Legend,10,15 February 2001,"Yes, Titanic is a rather simple film in terms of storyline and character depth.  It is cliched and predictable.  But even with this, Titanic is simply one of the most entertaining and engrossing fairy tales of all time. It is truly one of Hollywood's greatest guilty pleasures.  Those who negatively criticize it do so simply because the film is popular.   A lot of wannabe  movie experts tend to look down upon it because it is their sophomoric opinion that anything popular or mainstream is simply not as good as the less popular art house or independent films.  As much as I love these small independent films, I still believe that Titanic has a special quality to it which gives it an almost magical essence.  It's hard not to like this film, assuming you can put all your jaded and cynical views aside.   A film like this comes along once every blue moon, and millions of movie goers around the world did well to make it into one of the most popular films of all time.",Titanic
1387,Aimee-8,Don't wait any longer to see this film if you haven't!,10,7 November 1999,"We just saw the movie now and after two years of hype I was ready for disappointment. But I wasn't a bit. I was spellbound from start to finish. When Jack and Rose hit the water I took a deep breath. We've actually watched it through twice in the same week. That never happens. Titanic was well done in every aspect: acting, music, effects, realism. We never noticed a model or a computer-enhancement (not that we looked too hard) while we were wrapped up in this story. Even though I knew how it ended I couldn't wait to see what happens next.",Titanic
1388,moviebuf-39,Another classic hit,9,28 April 2000,I liked this movie.  I thought the reproduced ship was remarkable.  To reenact that night was tough to do and they did it. It's one of those movies in which you laugh and cry.  The only other thing was Leo looks about 15 and Kate Winslet looks about 25.  Wonderful movie though!,Titanic
1389,D-Gen-X,The best love story ever.,10,1 August 1999,"I didn't know what to expect from ""Titanic"" when it first came out other than being the most expensive movie ever made and the ship sinking at the end.  But when I saw the film a few weeks after theatrical release, all I can say is that it was the best (until Star Wars: Episode 1).The story wasn't just about the ship sailing away with passengers, each of the survivors with their own stories to tell.  It was a love story between two young people (one rich [Kate Winslet] and one poor [Leonardo DiCaprio]) who just had to stick together while trying to survive disaster (""You jump, I jump.  Right?"" quotes Leo).Before the disaster, DiCaprio, who plays Jack Dawson, had all the spiritual tools on loving a girl like Rose Bukater, played by Kate Winslet,  who was only rich and didn't enjoy her way of life until she met him.  Then their love blossoms in the air that touches the audience and myself based on the WAY it was displayed: the spitting, the conversation, the dancing, the kiss, the portrait, and the sinking.The one particular element of the film that nearly reduced me into tears was the score (background music), which added to the drama of the film.  It sounded like an angel singing from heaven above (no wonder the soundtrack went platinum and won an Oscar). That's perhaps on why the movie was deemed ""sad"", and why it became so popular.This movie is definitely one of my favorite films, but it is the best romantic movie I've ever seen.  You won't hear nor see a guy like me comment a romance film like that, but I bet this film touched a lot of guys' hearts as much as the girls'(you know how most guys are: they don't want to admit it).",Titanic
1390,LouisFriendWA,Spoiler alert!!!!!!!,2,23 December 1999,"Okay, here it is...THE BOAT SINKS!!!  Yeah, I know, you all knew that...oops, you didn't?  Where were you during History class all through your schooling?  Anyway... I must admit that even though I never actually sat down and watched the thing from beginning to end, but I work at a video store and I was forced to watch the second tape of the movie for well over 28 days in a row. (The 1st tape was not viewed so as not to offend any customers during the scene where we were all forced to see Kate Winslet's endowments.)  Needless to say, when we finally were allowed to remove the now wasted tape from the VCR, I took the tape outside and promptly ran over it with my car.  It felt so good. With that one action I hoped to rid myself of this terrible viral infection brought on by watching this movie too many times. I hated the film although I had never really ""seen"" it.  I had bought a copy of the film before the 28-day onslaught but hadn't opened it yet, so I decidedly took it back to work with me and traded it for a DVD copy of another movie.  I felt no remorse, I questioned not my actions.  In fact, I felt good to know that the movie was no longer in my house. Earlier in the year (1998) I had to listen to everyone tell me how great it was and how much they loved it, and this was okay.  I am one of those people that many times don't like a movie just because ""EVERYONE"" loved it.  My favorites are not the box-office hits, they are the box-office flops, movies over-looked because of their lack of appeal to more than one group of people.  Those are the films that speak the loudest.  I had people tell me that they saw ""Titanic"" EIGHT times!!!  I pointed out that they had spent no less than $60 on admission not including the outrageous prices of popcorn, soda, and Sour Patch Kids.  All they could say was, ""It was worth it, man."" I view myself as a video nut and a video hound, and I say NO movie is worth paying well over $100 at a movie theatre to see the same movie over and over and over again. You all may disagree with me, and that is your personal right, but you all need to know that there are many of us that don't see what you see in this movie...and the only reason I gave it a rating of 2 was for the very well-done special effects...I have to give it at least that much. Moving along...",Titanic
1391,ted puff,"Flawed, but with a touch of the sublime.",7,26 September 1999,"An extraordinary interest still exists in Cameron's film, still argument rages over just how good it is. The timing of its release was significant, the obsession with the film might be explained as a form of pre millennial tension at the close of the most murderous century the human race has known, a century which began with such hope and optimism, and in which the Titanic was ironically such a proud symbol. 'A Night to remember' was released amid worries about the Bomb and the feeling that science was again out of control. 'Titanic' amid millennial jitters. The most discussed aspect is the script, there are lines in the film that are moronic, irritating, senseless and just plain dumb. Others were quoted from the U.S.Senate Enquiry, which proves how people then had a better command of language than we do. Why do Jack and Rose board at Southampton when they've come from Paris? Why doesn't the diamond fall out of Rose's pocket going down with a sinking ship? Why doesn't she find it in her pocket on the Carpathia before reaching New York? Why is it that you can be rude to the ship's owner, assault and abuse the staff, 'fly' from an offlimits bow, run through boiler rooms and cargo holds, cause two stewards looking for you to drown, distract the lookouts, climb in and out of lifeboats, damage property, and NEVER get into trouble? Why do the steerage accept rich snooty first class gatecrashing their party? Why, why, why?Too much time is spent on the wrapping footage, though the unseen sunken interiors are breathtaking. The taste of showing the Titanic sinking like a computer game in front of a survivor isn't questioned. The dissolve of the wreck into the pristine ship packs an emotional wallop every time. Winslet isn't a great actress, she plays the same in every film. On Leo, when Titanic leaves port in a classic series of images, we feel his joy. But it's downhill from here.The engine room montage is another classic, but it's looking artificial. Murdoch's feet are all over the deck. The ship looks like it's populated by the Thunderbirds.Relief, Victor Garber arrives as Thomas Andrews and gives the dialogue meaning, conviction, dignity and charm, quite a feat since thanks to Cameron's warped priorities he only speaks two lines. A thing apparent in Rose is how lacking in charm she is, lighting up at table, and indelicate. No Edwardian. And as this film isn't subtle, but whacks you on the head and biffs you in the stomach we must have the class speech straight away. Tommy Ryan is the most irritating character I've seen on screen and completely unlike any Irish I've met. The next situation isn't credible. Isn't there a better way of introducing these two than the unbelievable jumping off the stern. There is one good line in the dull walk and talk that a first class wench would have said 'This is MY part of the ship' huffs Rose. But with the spit scene any hopes of a romantic wallow are dead.The cheek of the dinner party is how Jack Dawson, somebody who if Rose had chopped his hand off with the axe, would have been pushed to earn a living, has the temerity to lecture a brilliant engineer, a captain with 40 years experience and captains of industry on how to live life, when he hasn't started shaving himself. We need a unmaterialistic message in films, even if it would come better from a director who hadn't overspent his budget by $100million. But the portrayal of rich and poor is straight out of a propaganda film for the gulag.It's a pity, there is such a brilliant Irish band on board, and there aren't equally brilliant dancers.Whether the film has a Christian message at the core or if it's proclaiming that doing your own thing is more important, it's hard to say. The divine service was open to all classes so Jack being turned away is misleading and pointless. A stunning scene on the bow but there hasn't been a romantic exchange yet between this couple that convinces us. Such models of taste and discernment and the brightest thing they say about Monet is that his use of colour is extraordinary. The funniest line in film history: 'This is a ship, only so many places she could be'. The next shot: Titanic bowling merrily along. A thousand rooms!The iceberg finally turns up, the collision is breathtaking, the acting top notch and inseparable from the historical event even if Titanic hits the only iceberg in the whole Atlantic. The surreal party with music and lifejackets shows Cameron can write. Sometimes. But Jack manacled up is tedious and the crew wouldn't have done that on a sinking ship. The real story is lost in Rose running around. The lifeboats when we see them are done far better than any other version, and the timeline makes perfect sense.Titanic alone and helpless, a tiny ship with a futile rocket in an empty ocean is inspired. The film takes on a different dimension and has a touch of the sublime. The images that accompany the hymn are elegiac and perfect. The choreography around the last two boats can't be surpassed. Now we do feel a sense of the panic and despair. The water through the dome, a baptism of fire. No one can fail to be moved by the 20 minutes of terrible destruction. The lifeboat scenes couldn't have been done better, and the Carpathia is a painting brought to life. How exactly Rose retains her incognito through the years when she's a publicized actress, an aviator and everything else in the known universe isn't explained. The ending is a straight pinch from 'Somewhere in time' which did a better job of a love story set in 1912. The frustrating thing is how many things ARE done well. There are gems of writing and acting. It looks terrific. But it proves that you can recreate the cutlery, carpets, staterooms, clothes, but it's so much harder to recreate history. It isn't 1912. And half the film isn't Titanic.",Titanic

1393,jreyes-2,"""Titanic"" can't remain afloat.",2,1 May 2000,"Much has been made of director James Cameron's attention to detail. Ironically, Leonardo Dicaprio seems incredibly 90's in his demeanor and appearance.  Additionally, his hand is perfectly manicured and ages some 20 years when he sketches Kate Winslet later in the film.  The story line is borrowed from ""For Whom the Bell Tolls""; and, the effects are only okay. Low budget genius like John Carpenter and Able Ferera could have made this film much better with a fraction of the budget.  I can't believe this film was showered in awards; perhaps, some of the titanic budget was used as bribe money.",Titanic
1394,silvourbolt,so close to being great,5,2 September 2000,"Titanic was a goldmine. It's potential had not been tapped into since ""A NIGHT TO REMEMBER"" and Cameron saw the perfect way to milk the audience emotion by creating characters we felt for on a ship headed for disaster. And boy, does Cameron know how to convey disaster, and the horror of sinking to an icy death.Cameron decided to go with a flashback account. Sounds good. The added perspective would help tremendously. Cameron decided to throw in a very interesting modern-day search for a priceless gem. Oooo interesting, great, keep going. Cameron decides to use the ""rich-girl captivated by poor-boy"" theme. Wonderful. It hasn't been done properly in 4 decades. Cameron decides to make the focus VERY SPECIFICALLY centered on the couple. Hmm... well, ok, as long as it is done right, and done very carefully with respect to the ploy of the ship. Cameron decides to cast Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet as the lead characters and drops almost all other character interaction INCLUDING that of the charcters in 1999 who are listening to the story. ARRRGH! NOOO! Bad! Bad! DiCaprio is completely wrong for this role, and so is Winslett. The lack of acting and emotion in DiCaprio's performance sinks the movie faster than any glacier could ever hope for. The movie is more centered on CiCaprio than the sinking of the ship, and DiCaprio falls flat on his face. It was a poor decision in the first place, putting DiCaprio, whose only impressive effort was in WHAT'S EATING GILBERT GRAPE?, is so completely and utterly wrong for this film it's mind-boggling. I found myself screaming ""Act! Act you fool!"" DiCaprio could easily have been replaced with a bag of sugar with a magic-marker created starry-eyed face and goofy grin. However, the people who made this film so much money (all wearing their scrunchies and Dr.Pepper lip gloss) love him, so what can you say. As for Ms. Winslett, I just did not like her. I think she gave a poor performance to a character that couldn't afford to have a poor performance. She came off as an annoying brat, and unsympathetic. She also helps to sink this movie, almost as much as DiCaprio. That being said, everything else in the movie is gold. It seems that every moment when Leo and Kate are offscreen is a breath of fresh air, and is excellent in execution. Unfortunately, these moments are few and far-between. Sorry Cameron, your fundamental concept didn't work, and ruined what could have been the greatest movie of all time. I give you a10 for your story about the sinking of the TITANIC, but I take away five for your story about Jack and Rose. 5/10********************",Titanic
1395,Fletch F. Fletch,What happened to Good Will Hunting?,3,1 June 2000,"I'll admit it if I want to or not... Titanic was a decent movie overall, and on the surface its worthy of a five rating. However, once you calculate for bad acting performances, the worst script/lines from a 1998 Oscar nominated movie, and the shadowy feeling of the overbearing, heavy hand of Cameron and his action film special effects- you get a three. Furthermore, because of the media-hype, because of young girls, and because the Academy is a sucker for epic, classic movies, the real Best Picture of 1998, Good Will Hunting, was lost in the swell. I mean come on... you're going to tell me that there is a scene between Leonardo and Kate that is half as powerful as any between Matt and Driver? Let me just remind you of a scene between Robin and Matt- Robin confronts Matt's character with pictures of his body badly bruised by the abuse he suffered from his father. Matt says something like 'this is B.S.- this is not important,' to which Robin keeps repeating ""Its ok, its ok..."" Eventually Matt falls weeping into Robin's arms- now that scene was powerful, moving, and let's not forget cheap. Basically, Titanic won movie of the year because it was pretty-looking, nice and shiny, and was terribly expensive. What a waste when compared to Good Will Hunting...",Titanic

It did deserve an Oscar for the effects but that is all.  I remember Mr. Dicaprio whining about not being nominated for a best actor Oscar.  Well, with due respect to the young thespian, I didn't think he deserved to be nominated either.  And the THEME SONG BY CELINE DION!  I like Ms. Dion but that song! Here was the twist to that song.  When it was played dance music style, I loved it!  The original version though, I wanted to hang myself the more it kept playing.  Well I just had to tolerate it while it was on.However, many people liked it as the movie & song of 1997 and I have to respect that.  My pick was L.A. Confidential as far as best movie was concern and I thought their sound track was better.  I can look on the bright side though, Kevin Spacey won the Oscar for Best Actor for ""L.A."".

It's unbelievable that such a bad tearjerker can be doing so well at the box office!!Where is the plot? Well, the movie does have ... sort of a plot, but it's very very very weak. The love between Jack and Rose is so superficial.Where are the characters? I can't find any real character! Everywhere I look, I find cliches and stereotypes. The rich must be arrogant, ignorant, evil, etc, while the poor must be the exact opposite.Can the actors act? Sure, every single one can but not in this movie. The acting is somewhere between so-so and bad! I've seen better performance from Cathy Bates, Leonardo DiCarpio, Bill Paxton.. in other movies.The visual effects is the only saving grace! The sinking of the ship is just magnificent!! It's just a shame they could have spent so much money to recreate the ship but they couldn't create a good story that has characters with substance!For teenagers who are flooded with hormones and a not-so-well-developed brain, it's understandable that they love the movie.

I wasn't particularly sorry when the sinking part is over but sort of glad that I didn't have to remain in my seat any longer.  The love story is too saccharine to to have any substance. Although I agree with some of the reviews that the movie has its merits, some of the supporting roles and scenes are touching and the cinematography is pretty good, with a multi-billion dollar budget and three hour run time, a movie better be magnificent both in cinematography and story development. James Cameron spent way too much money, time and focus on making a grand picture and neglected characters and story development.  For the very reason, Titanic will not collect the kind of fame a multi-billion dollar film is supposed to bring.  So on the whole I think the money could've been well spent elsewhere both for the movie-goers and James Cameron.Two great movies in this category are worth seeing, Gone with the Wind and Gladiator.",Titanic

So if I remember Rose and Jack the main characters are super in love even though they have only known eachother for 2-3 days. Even one of those cringy mafia love stories are more believable than this and they are hardly believable. Anyways it's a super cliche trope which is usually never done well. Also Jack really did not have place on that floating piano beside Rose? Based on what I remeber he did have place and the whole Jack dies and Rose survives could have been that they both survived. If the creators wanted Jack to die they should have made his death ineviteble. But they didn't they made it dumb.If the creators of this movie wanted to make a story about the titanic but not a documentary then they should not have made this a romance story.How they could have done a movie about the titanic but that is not a documentary:1. Talk to real survivors
2. Make it a series
3. The main cast should consist of people who have known eachother for
a long time, like family
4. Kill of a part of the main cast and show how the survivors were afected
by the loss.Aparantly a bunch of people cry when watching this movie yet me and my bff can not wrap our heads around why they cry.Side Note:

1415,RagDolly,A classic. Just incredible...,10,17 July 2010,"'Titanic' is a film so revered and praised that it can become tiresome and many choose to bash it just to spite its popularity but the truth is that 'Titanic' is a classic and is worthy of any praise it gets.Everybody knows how epic this film is. Everybody knows the extraordinary lengths that were gone to to make this such a memorable piece and everybody knows of the excellent performances given by Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio and the supporting cast. The incredible feat that this film achieves is, despite its huge scale, you can get entangled and wrapped up in each character. The simple love story of Jack and Rose is played out so intensely, it's beautiful and engaging to watch no matter how many times you've seen it before.What I love about this film is the fact that I can pick out plenty of cheesy moments and lines and many instances where Cameron has tried to over-dramatise an already tragic and epic story, as well as one ill-timed cut to the 'modern' day subplot, but I don't mind. I can get carried away in the story and love those moments as well.The truth is, this film is beautiful. The one-liners and funny moments early on that highlight the tragedy of the end, still touching and shocking despite the action and panic in them, are beaten only by the simplicity and beauty of the relationship between Jack and Rose. It sounds cheesy and cliché but it is still as beautiful and romantic as ever and this film will always rate highly with me.",Titanic

Like video games or something amusing? Fast forward to the last 45 minutes & enjoy. The icing on the cake is the scrouny nerd gets it. Ha!",Titanic
1417,dramawatcher,Not the best of films,3,16 August 2010,"That film appears to be not so much about the Titanic but a made up story set on the Titanic. I find these scenes of Rose, Jack and Rose's posh family a bit disturbing in places. The best thing about this I'd say is that Rose decided at the end to start a new life away from her posh parents and this villain she was engaged to. I understand though there are other films that show less of what's happening with individual passengers and more about how the ship hit the iceberg and the damage that occurred.I wouldn't say that film is as bad as the more recent film the same two actors starred in. Revolutionary Road I found quite painful and thought it was much worse than Titanic.",Titanic

1419,aandmbird,Three cheers for the iceberg,1,24 November 2010,"This may contain spoilers, although nothing I say could spoil any further this utterly shoddy and offensive piece of junk anymore than many of the comments already on this site. This films stinks from bow to stern. The banal and predictable dialogue and plot are only matched by its crass stupidity in the ludicrous national stereotyping. Jolly ""Oirish"" down in steerage begorrah, moustache twirling English villains and heroic Yanks (yawn). So far so predictable and in itself would make for a comedically bad film. However I found the persistent national stereotyping became more offensive as the film went on and came to head as the boat(and the film) finally sank. I'm sure I wasn't the only one hoping an albatross would drop something unpleasant on Kate Winslet as she stood on the front of the ship in that buttock clenchingly corny scene. The only thing I found moving was the bile in my stomach. Unfortunately some gullible people will take this as a historical document. It is not. Go and see ""A night to Remember"" instead.",Titanic
1420,CSH9337,The most over-rated film ever!,6,24 March 2003,"I don't know how this film possibly won best picture for 1997.  This story was extremely historically inaccurate by the way the characters talked and acted toward each other and the computer animation was pretty fake at times. James Cameron's other films such as Terminator, Aliens, and The Abyss were much better.  He should stick to sci-fi!",Titanic
1421,hyper777,"Beautiful, fascinating and positively iconic",10,12 March 2010,"This is an INCREDIBLE movie. Every bit of it was beautifully shot, and the accuracies to the look of the actual Titanic were miraculously on point. This movie is, in one word, iconic. Everyone knew the Titanic, and now everyone knows this movie. It is arguably one of the most famous love stories of all time, and although the concept is tired: rich girl meets poor boy, they can't be together, etc., the fact that they are aboard the infamous RMS Titanic is reason enough to consider it different. Every scene is gorgeously picturesque, and makes for some of the most memorable movie moments ever. The actors are also great, and the characters really make this story. Although Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet aren't quite yet at their prime in their most famous movie, they play these characters convincingly and with a lot of heart. You feel for them every step of the way, and DiCaprio and Winslet have a chemistry that simply can't be matched. You can tell how much they care about each other as people, and that translates into a fiercely protective, emotionally powerful romance on screen. Overall, this movie is one of the best out there. Its length (around three hours) may bother some people, but it never feels tedious to watch. James Cameron is an impeccable director that looks to make every detail perfect, and some of the small, seemingly insignificant scenes he added were a few of the most moving of the entire film. Titanic is a passionate, beautiful story of a doomed love that will keep your heart racing and your tears flowing until the very end.",Titanic

Director James Cameron proves in this film just why theres only ONE James Cameron. This film is so good that I hesitate to call it a movie....Its an experience.....a VERY emotional experience...Anyone who wasnt emotionally moved by this movie must really be emotionless. Hearing Celine Dion humming the song towards the end of the movie just added to the emotion. To describe the people who hate this movie I can say this...You could give these people a brand new BMW M3 and they will find faults with it...That is what happens with a film as brilliant as this...Kate Winslet and Leonard DeCaprio are in TOP form and deliver a performace straight from heaven. I dont know how they did it but,wow this film is just something else.

1423,TheRothOfKhan,Incredible Movie Making,10,7 December 2019,"An absolutely spellbinding film that still holds up over 20 years later. I first saw this as a 12-year-old in 1997 and recall being utterly captivated by the story, the imagery, the characters, the score and the sheer spectacle of it all. 'Titanic' was an event, not just a film. There was nothing like it before, and there has been nothing like it since.
Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both relatively unknown actors at the time of the film's original release, shine as Jack and Rose, two young people from opposite ends of the social spectrum who are brought together by fate against the backdrop of one of history's greatest tragedies. Winslet steals every scene with her portrayal of a deeply unhappy woman thrust into an engagement of convenience at the behest of her domineering mother, only finding happiness and her true self when she crosses paths with di Caprio's Jack Dawson. Tragedy inevitably strikes however, and it becomes a fight for survival as the great ship Titanic founders. For all of the special effects, it is the chemistry between Winslet and di Caprio that drives the film. If you have ever become infatuated with someone in a very short space of time, then it is very easy to relate to the relationship between Jack and Rose. They perfectly capture the intensity of infatuation and the recklessness of youth. Other excellent characters include Billy Zane's charming but abrasive Cal Hockley, Frances Fisher's sneering Ruth Dewitt Bukater and Kathy Bates' bolshy Molly Brown. Finally, the great Gloria Stewart portrays 'old' Rose with such sincerity and heart that it is difficult to believe she didn't live through all of this in real life.",Titanic

Nicely shot, not too bad for acting, but predictable, over-the-top sentimentality kills what could still have been a great plot with suspense and surprise. Instead it's so predictable as to be boring. The effects are good at the end, but they're hardly worth sitting through the rest of it to get there.

1427,kaw1990,Love can't get any purer,10,23 August 2003,"The target of complaints against this magnificent film is centered between the beautiful relationship of Jack and Rose, two starry-eyed lovers who find the other and their inner selves when they meet in a straineous situation. It's almost hard to believe the critism thrown at this wonderful movie. Jack and Rose's love is one of a kind, pure, dangerous, thrilling, and innocent.  They are the tool Cameron uses to bring us to the past.  To Titanic. This love leaves you aching with longing for something at least half as beautiful.  The barriers between them, Cal, Ruth, Society, reputations, money...they are all huge stamped reminders of a world once lived.  The feeling in your heart that you get when Rose finally comes to the open-armed Jack and they unchain their desires and meet lips at last is indescribable. So, in conclusion, I guess I am saying that the love itself is half of what makes this awesome movie amazing, and I beg you to watch it without prejudice, to hear the ghostly music and feel an overflowing joy and sadness.",Titanic

I just watched the movie.  Even though I have seen it maybe sixty times (no kidding) it still took my breath away.  Amazing, that's what it is.  I was torn to tears when Jack slipped beneath the icy black surface of the sea. Rose and Jack shared a kind of pure love we all hope to experience.  The very end was like a little taste of heaven itself, leaving me with a longing feeling to see what was next.  It was wonderful.  The love story, the tragedy, the true facts - all perfectly shown.  If you think that this movie is a flop, read some of Robert Ballard's books about his expedition to the Titanic's gravesite.  See the pictures of the debris, of the shoes where bodies once lay.  Then watch Titanic again.  I swear you will never have felt so moved in your life.",Titanic

My sister, who could not drive at the time, and her friend wanted to go and offered to pay my way in.  I figured what the heck, a free movie.Within the first 10 minutes of the movie, I was hooked.  The scenes between Rose and Jack were very well written and everything about the movie was great.  Jim Cameron truly showed what life was like on the Titanic with the steerage people (3rd class) being the low men on the totem pole.  The tear jerking scenes between the Irish woman and her 2 children and the elderly couple in bed towards the end were probably some of the best scenes I've viewed in a long time.Great movie!",Titanic
1432,snoozejon,"A tragic historical incident, dumbed down in order to empty pockets of the MTV generation in the name of popular culture.(Spoilers)",1,6 September 2004,"Once upon a time there was a director by the name of James. He brought us wonderfully, thrilling science-fiction such as Terminator and Aliens. These movies were the stuff blockbusters were made of and he looked to have a fantastic future ahead of him as the dawn of computer generated special effects landed upon the film industry. Terminator 2 showed gave us glimpses of what was possible in this new era........and then it happened...................1997........countless awards..........obscene amounts of money............outlandish barrage of advertising............maximum profit margin........Titanic was here!I have never (ever) been one to jump on the bandwagon and be overly critical for the sake of it, in fact I have often taken the opposite stance from the majority just to get an argument going. Titanic however was a film I only took one single positive out of - that of Kate Winslett being absolutely gorgeous throughout!Quickly - the dialogue was like something out of Beverly Hills 90210, the acting was more wooden than my nephew's tree house, images meant to terrify were actually comical (man falling from ship and hitting propeller), historically false (don't even get me started because there's too much), it had dire theme music (up there with the bodyguard for cheese) and the pointless love story was so tedious, self absorbing and pathetic that it disrespected the plight of everyone else involved (I was glad when he died and disappointed when she did not).It was plainly obvious from the word go that this picture was designed to appeal to MTV watching, bubblegum chewing, boy-with-car chasing, teenage girls (DeCaprio himself resembled something less heroic than the weedy member of a boy band) who would drag their sex-starved boyfriends out for a three and a half hour chick-flick hoping to get lucky later! The worst aspect was that it did not stop at that point. Millions of dumbed down, culture vultures went to see this expensive waste of celluloid because ""it cost so much to produce it must be great"" and ""Steve and Barbara said it was good and they know their movies"". The crowning glory arrived when Titanic swept the boards at the Academy Awards. King James of Hollywood had a serious moment of silence for the victims of the fatal evening on which his three and a half hour farce was based. It looked to me as if he was praying for forgiveness after making a fortune off inaccurately portraying the circumstances that lead to the death of a lot of people. However, if people are stupid and sentimental enough to buy into this kind of rubbish they deserve to get ripped off. Good luck to Hollywood if that is how they want to make money, I'd do it if I had those kind of chances in life!It is right up there on my all time worst movies list with other silly, historically false/human interest tripe like ""The Patriot"" and ""Pearl Harbor"".",Titanic

I thought the movie was fairly entertaining with outstanding special effects, but had a large problem with the lack of realism, especially ironic as Cameron 'got' most of the details correctly.The 'love story' was patently ludicrous, but probably the thing that drove the numbers at the box office, the treatment of historical figures like 'Molly' Brown-for example-was appalling, dripping with misogyny.With a little more even handed treatment the movie could have been outstanding and compelling to the degree that it actually deserved the Oscars it won that year, and still included a plausible romantic plot.",Titanic
1434,Hojangs,A true cinematic epic.,9,13 September 2012,"A film of such incredible proportions is a rarity in cinema. 'Titanic,' was recently re-released on Blu-Ray, and I took the opportunity to watch the film for the first time in over a decade. I was 8 years old when I last saw this film, something which probably contributed to my opinion that the film was over-long, soppy and incredibly dull. How wrong I was.'Titanic,' is epic cinema at its finest. So many aspects of the film are truly wonderful, the scale, the performances and the design to name a few. James Cameron has repeatedly cemented himself as one of the most talented directors in Hollywood, managing to craft gargantuan products with colossal budgets and still maintain a wonderful human emotion to his works. Though the sinking of the Titanic in 1912 serves as the basis for this film, the true meat of it is a love story between two young people from polar opposite ends of society; Jack Dawson, played by a boyish Leonardo DiCaprio, a lower class drifter with a gift for art, and Rose, a higher class young woman trapped in the confines of a loveless engagement, portrayed by a fresh-faced Kate Winslet. Over the course of 3 hours and 14 minutes their love story plays out among the hundreds of stories of that fateful voyage that tragically killed so many.The true wonder of 'Titanic,' is its sheer scale. The film was originally released in 1997, yet the production dwarfs that of most large scale films of today's Hollywood. The costume design and set production is absolutely staggering, truly worthy of the Oscars the design and production won. The special effects are also worth praising, especially considering that the film is now 15 years old. However, with the transition to Blu-Ray, and the clarity that the image receives because of the transfer, some of the effects are unfortunately rather obvious, though this does nothing to detract from the overall experience. The sound design is also excellent, particular praise reserved for the score. There is an almost Enya-like quality to the score, gentle and mellow yet rousing in all the correct places.The performances are all excellent. DiCaprio and Winslet both carry the production on their young shoulders, and do so with aplomb. Their chemistry is impressive, and both actors are pleasant and likable. Billy Zane, as Rose's arrogant fiancé, is suitably horrid and despicable, and Zane gives probably the best performance of his career. All roles are performed well, including Kathy Bates as a 'new-money,' socialite and Bernard Hill as the captain of the doomed voyage. There are so many moments from this film that are frequently quoted and fondly remembered, and there's a reason. 'Titanic,' is an incredible experience, and well worth picking up on Blu-Ray. I'm certainly glad I did.",Titanic

The level of detail Cameron achieved is truly amazing: the opening sequence is footage of the actual wreck, and the ship was recreated true to the original plans (tho' scaled down, of course). Interiors are exactly how the real rooms looked in 1912.The sinking sequence have the best special effects I've ever seen; so seamless that you unaware of them, you're just watching the ship break apart and go down.There are only two historical mistakes in the script, minor things really. Have you spotted them? These days, it's considered ""cool"" to be cynical about this movie, but I consider it ""cooler"" to make up your own mind. Perhaps watching it again will convince you that Cameron did an amazing job not only for lovers of romance, but for anyone fascinated with the historical event itself.",Titanic

Here you have perhaps the worst single tragedy of the 20th century, and, what do we get? -- A phony, forced, class struggle ""love"" story so poorly written that no one with half a brain cares one whit about the characters. Obviously, the producers of this shipwreck of a film assume that the public is too dull to let the sheer drama of the event itself sustain the story, so we're assaulted by perhaps the worst script ever written. Not only is there not one once of truthful human emotion in the screenplay, it's insulting as well. The Poseidon Adventure, as trite as it was, had more veracity than this muddle.Titanic will lower your IQ, guaranteed, and probably cause warts too. If you need to see a film about this fateful night that actually treats its audience like an adult, rent A Night to Remember, a vastly superior film.Two stars for technical achievement only.",Titanic

I cannot fathom why this film received any Oscars apart from anything for special effects (in that department, it excels). Yes, the actual cracking apart and sinking of the legendary ocean liner was extremely well done. But as for the rest, just one word: disappointment.First, there's Leo--not a terrible actor, but pretty limited here. And Kate? About the same goes for her. Then, there is the story. It would have been more interesting if it had focused on the lives of others who were actually on the ship--including the crew. It's also painfully over-long, AND it has a Celine Dion song to boot. How much more wrong can it possibly get? An overrated piece of dross indeed.",Titanic

Kate Winslet lit up the screen when she played Rose Dewitt Bukater, a young rich girl with a very strong passion. And Leanardo Dicaprio, although not a very big fan of him, showed magnifinacly in the movie playing Jack, a poor young boy, with a great artistic talent. He seek-ed adventure and challenges and one of those challenges was to have Rose for him. The movie showed surprises one after another, keeping the three and a half hours entertaining. The most memorable scenes were when Dicaprio and Winslet were standing at the edge of the ship, as if to fly away together. Whenb the 'Titanic sank it gave me shrivels up my spine. Never before had I ever seen anything so Dramatic and Horrific, but of course, it would not be 'Titanic' without the sinking. The special effects were unbelievable. The movie let you see out of the peoples eyes as the ship sank. YOu can almost hear the hearts pounding of the crew when the 'Titanic' hit the ice berg. The love story makes this movie what it is. The music gave the movie extra sadness as Celine Dion sings 'My heart will Go On'.

I first viewed this movie when I was a child of 9 years old. As you may have guessed I hated it. Now I know what you're thinking, what does a nine year old kid know about romance ? Funny that you ask that because I didn't know a thing about it. I was a child who still believed in cooties. Then at the end of November this film came on TNT, I viewed it and still hated it. I'm 17 years old now. The thing that I hate the most about this is it's crappy dialog, it's as if it was written by a 6 year old kid. ""A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets"", This is one of the worst quotes in any movie I have ever watched. ""I'm the king of the world"", um, who still says that ? The other thing I had a problem with the actual story itself. To me, they James Cameron just took a true event, stuck a soap opera into it filled with mediocre acting and one dimensional characters, and said ""hey let's see how much we can rob from the public with this"". They accomplished their mission, they robbed 600 million from the public. I don't even want to go into the times where Rose broke her accent. All the characters in the film can be described in a couple of words.Jack: Poor Artist. Rose: Spoiled brat. Cal: Snob. Ruth: Snob.etc.See what I mean ? The only thing good about this movie is the visuals, they were surprisingly good. The ice berg looked cool and the ships sinking was over par as well. This movie could've been excellent if they just upped the acting alittle, made some deep characters. Alast this film was made the way it is. Every time I see it, I hate it alittle more...",Titanic
1443,slewfoot-97853,Definitely not for historians or Titanic fans,4,3 March 2018,"Given Cameron's apparent interest in the actual tragic event and the money that was spent this film borders on being a travesty as it was an opportunity lost to tell one of the great stories of our recent history.
I watched Titanic from start to finish the other night and came away completely disappointed that most of the very interesting elements of the real saga were either glossed over or omitted completely and replaced by a schmaltzy implausible drawn out love story.
Given the budget and the state of the art effects used this movie could have been great. Had it properly examined the tragedy from the point of view of the real characters involved and their reactions and behaviour instead of some hokey fabricated Romeo and Juliet theme complete with ludicrous villainy and gun-play, it could have been a true classic simply by portraying the multitude of real and totally compelling stories that occurred.
Where was the re-telling of the infamous role the Californian played as it was anchored 10 miles away during the whole terrible ordeal, oblivious and indifferent to the horror being played out within arms reach? Where was the heroics of the Carpathia turning off all heating in order to make more speed as she rushed through the dangerous ice field to rescue over seven hundred souls?
Where was Captain Smith's refusal to believe the ship could not stay afloat after the collision and the unforgettable moment of grim realisation that the Titanic would surely sink? And what about all of the heart rending decisions being made as the men hastily and gallantly chose to put the lives of their women and children before their own? Surely these tragic separations between fathers and their wives and children carried 100 times more feeling and emotion than a pair of smitten teenagers who had only known each other for a couple of days.
And no matter how much sentiment one might feel about losing their one true love 70 years ago in tragic circumstances, no one is going to toss a 300 million dollar diamond into the drink.",Titanic

We see it in the opening shots of ""Titanic,"" encrusted with the silt of 85 years; a remote-controlled TV camera snakes its way inside, down corridors and through doorways, showing us staterooms built for millionaires and inherited by crustaceans.Movies like this are not merely difficult to make at all, but almost impossible to make well. The technical difficulties are so daunting that it's a wonder when the filmmakers are also able to bring the drama and history into proportion. I found myself convinced by both the story and the saga. The setup of the love story is fairly routine, but the payoff--how everyone behaves as the ship is sinking--is wonderfully written, as passengers are forced to make impossible choices. Even the villain, played by Zane, reveals a human element at a crucial moment (despite everything, damn it all, he does love the girl).The image from the Titanic that has haunted me, ever since I first read the story of the great ship, involves the moments right after it sank. The night sea was quiet enough so that cries for help carried easily across the water to the lifeboats, which drew prudently away. Still dressed up in the latest fashions, hundreds froze and drowned.

When it came out about ten years ago, I thought it sucked. Most would attribute this to the fact that I was just a small child with little taste in anything. Which is true. When I was young, if there wasn't plenty of violence and cool things in a movie, I hated it.However, watching this again as a supposed adult, I find that young me was quite right. Titanic was a borefest. It was one lame line after the other. It was just a fictional princess-falls-in-love-with-a-peasant story set during a historical event. What garbage. It didn't even stand out as a love story. It was bland and uneventful. I don't see why it got so much praise. It was such a mediocre piece of work, yet it's supposedly one of the best films of all time. This piece of mediocrity receives such praise while well thought out action, horror, and thriller films get tossed aside and labeled as distasteful exploitation films.Really, I'm not all about action and violence, but lets give credit and money where they're due. And neither are due here. This was easily the most bland movie ever made. I'd relate watching this to getting jabbed in the eyeballs with butcher knives repetitively for three hours. However, that would actually be more exciting than watching Titanic.",Titanic

Something so horrific like the Titanic disaster is ripe for modern story telling but James ""I made Avatar so that means im a good writer"" Cameron makes it about a boring, cliche ridden snooze fest. Even for 1997 it looks dated.Awful overrated trash.",Titanic
1449,Joeyy,7/10 ? this should be at least 9/10,9,10 January 2006,"First of all how could you people give this movie such a low score, i have seen a lot of sad movies and this is the first to ""almost"" make me cry. I'm shocked that you gave this masterpiece a 7/10 and think just because this is a ""chick flick"" about a forbidden romance on a big ship that sinks, is that its going to bomb. I think that some people who haven't even seen this movie have voted for it, and i strongly suggest you don't do that to be accepted by others. The acting in this movie was excellent, Kate Winslet, and Leo's chemistry was obviously visible. The writing for this film was extraordinary. The effects for the sinking of this ship was just incredible, and this movie let you bond with everyone, even people you didn't know. When the ship sinks and everyone dies you feel sorry for them. My opinion watch this movie it is very enjoyable and i liked it.",Titanic
1450,pheluda,A Cinematic Ode to Human Memory....,9,27 April 2008,"The first time I happened to watch Titanic (the movie), I was barely into my teenage years and barely out of primary school. Naturally, what I found to be most appealing (apart from the delights of a naked Kate Winslet) was the brilliant way in which this true human tragedy had been brought on screen  the grand sets, the accurate reproduction, the seamless special effects (in case you're wondering, I grew up to be an engineer). It left quite a mark on me  I confess to have seen hundreds of documentaries on how and why 'The Unsinkable Ship' dropped to the bottom of the ocean on its maiden voyage, so much so that I had become a self-professed guru on any and every Titanic factoid Many repeat viewings later, I've developed a slightly different perspective towards this piece of cinema that still never ceases to amaze me. I'm in my twenties now, and have had my fair share of experiences  crush, heartbreak, love, et al (all the necessary experiences that are a pre-requisite for one to truly appreciate the world's favourite 'chick-flick'). I've realized that with time, my favourite portions from the movie have changed. Whereas earlier, I would happily skip the first half but never fail to catch the second, now I find myself to be fonder of the first hour, and even fonder of the last half. A part of the reason would be the advancement in digital effects since that time, which have given me the ability to grudgingly spot sections where the seamless computer effects don't seem to be so, well, seamless any more.The main reason, however, is that I've developed something akin to an emotional bond with this film. Its brilliance lies in the way it manages to tell the story of a very personal tragedy while always focusing on, and never diluting, the epic tragedy that was the Titanic. And the moment where it never fails to touch a chord (relax, it's not the moment of Jack's death  I'm not even that clichéd) is when the now rather old and spotty Rose tells her listeners, 'I don't even have a picture of him; he exists now, only in my memory' A simple, yet beautiful and poignant moment, one that we can all relate with, especially for those among us who particularly cherish their memories, whatever they be. Memories always leave a mark (and sometimes they leave behind scars), such that, ever so often, a single instance can stay with us for an entire lifetime. Memories shape us, mould us, and are an integral part in the development and continued growth of what is known as an emotionally intelligent being. They truly are the human part within us animals.Titanic then, is really quite a reflection of the true power of Human Memory.",Titanic

But, as the Celine Dion song implies (""My heart will go on and on""), there was a VERY REAL TRAGEDY of these ""poor"" people trapped in the middle of a dark, freezing ocean, with no ""high tech"" to help save them. The terrifying last half of the movie, with terrified people running back and forth trying to escape the inevitable REALLY GETS TO ME the more I see this movie. Tragedies happen every day in the world, but this was 1912.Don't know what else to say - except that I DO GET TEARY-EYED at the ending.

1452,maura-miller,Titanic,8,17 April 2006,"If you have ever considered Gone With The Wind to be less than a masterpiece, you'll have to admit that this one is no less either! Titanic is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells the story of love and hope. The two lovers both think the world is there for them and classes cannot influence their deep love for eachtother.Although the movie is long it is never boring. A reason for that are the performances. DiCaprio is very good, charming and sometimes funny, Winslet is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Cameron. To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do, but he makes it seem so easy. It is one of the strongest directing I have ever seen.Besides the story and the acting we have the music, the sets, the costumes, and the cinematography. It is all great. It will be a classic from now on, right up there with GWTW!",Titanic

The story is predictable and boring, the soundtrack is equivalent to a million fingernails on a million chalkboards. The only redeeming thing about this film is the amazing performance by the master, Billy Zane. Once again Mr. Zane shows off his prodigious acting abilities and turns a rather bland movie into a master piece. Leonardo DiCaprio should have paid closer attention to him and maybe he would have learned something. This movie is only worth watching if you fast forward to Billy Zane's parts and the part where the guy who use to play guitar at the bar by my old house tries to give the Captain a life jacket.

Then why, oh why did this movie glue me to my seat for 3 hours - in the year 2018? It's absolutely thrilling! My rewatch was a complete surprise: Fantastic action, great directing, even the visuals didn't age as ugly as they could have. And the acting performances! I remember everyone being very sceptic about Leonardo diCaprio and Kate Winslet back in the Nineties. But why? I don't get it. Also: What a joy to see Bernard Hill again, since I had a LotR-rewatch soon before. Noone can look as doomed as he can, be it in the battle of Helm's Deep or on the sinking Titanic.But maybe it's the time that's changed. They don't make movies like that anymore, because they can't. If they try, something like ""Avatar"" comes out: Something predictable. A cliché. Maybe the time of the great Hollywood blockbuster is just over. Thank God we can always rewatch Titanic.",Titanic

A real insult for the viewer's intelligence and for the victims of this tragedy. One of those cases, like Gone with the Wind, in which masses of people are taken for inexplicable reasons in the absent vision of a narcissistic director. Two hour and a half of absolute boredom, rescued by the wonderful sinking. The script seems to be done by a 12 year old kid: maybe that's the reason why kids loved it that much. Besides, Kate Winslet is too old looking for plausibly falling in love with a spoiled brat like Di Caprio appears to be, no matter how he's dressed (he never, ever ever seems like the charming artist vagrant he declares to be). Mr. Cameron, you're a damned lucky guy, but I preferred you when you did Terminator!",Titanic

If so, I recommend finding a bargain theater still showing it.  I feel this movie will lose a lot in the translation to the small screen.PARENTS:  Nudity, one sex scene, some violence.  Remember, many people died aboard Titanic, and the vivid images of frozen people floating in the ocean may be enough to give smaller kids nightmares.  After much consideration, I did take my 10-year-old daugher to see this and do not regret it.  The much -ballyhooed nude scene is actually quite beautiful and sensitive. Truthfully, it's my favorite part of the film and just thinking about it can bring tears to my eyes.Why so beloved?  Some are touched deeply by the tragic true events, some by the fictional love story.  In a good theater, the movie makes you feel as if you are right there:  I found myself moving my arms as if to swim and shivering with cold while sitting in my seat.  There are some beautiful seagues between Titanic past at full steam and Titanic present at the bottom of the ocean.  It's true, there are some legitimate criticisms of the rather lame, anachronistic dialogue, but, as a whole, this movie still rates very high.",Titanic

The two most hyped parts of this film, Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio were the two worst actors in the movies.  Billy Zane and Bill Paxton were surperb, but they didn't get nearly enough screen time.  Anyway, if you see this movie, expect to both hate and love the bad guy, which is what a makes a good movie great.  The rest of the acting (excluding Victor Garber and Bernard Hill) was weak.

1461,wahoo,This movie is the greatest of all time for one reason...,10,20 September 1998,"I know everyone is sick of reading about how the simple plot is wonderful and Kate and DiCaprio did a nice job with their roles.  Of course these are all true. However, no one has ventured to ask why this movie is the greatest of all time.  The key?  The haunting musical score of James Horner.  It takes all the effects and images and gives them meaning and emotion. Without his score (even John Williams probably could not have done it better), the movie would have lost a serious amount of the magic it held for me and the majority of the American public.  From the trademark flashback scene in the beginning to the life boats at the end, Horner's music captivated the emotions of the people and the tragedy of the shattering of a supposedly ""unsinkable era.""  Consequently, DONT buy the video unless you plan on buying a surround sound system.  You will not only be insulting Horner's phenomenal score but you will lose a lot of the emotional drive the film had in the theaters.",Titanic

I have to report that while watching ""Titanic"" I found myself being totally bored by the stereotypical charecters, i.e Snobbish English, Battleaxe American. Cameron has also reeled out loads of cliches and made them 10 times more boring. There is also an undertone of class struggle which is direly executed. As for ""Titanic"" being called a love story, that could never be said as there was no chemistry between the two leads and to me no feelings of love came across (James try watching other Oscar nominee As Good As It Gets for a decent love story). As for the tragedy that was Titanic in the film I did not feel as though the tragedy was fully put across and I left actually feeling numb from this glamourised dross. How this truly terrible film managed to get the Best Film Oscar is beyond me (As Good As It Gets a much better and beautiful film) and how Cameron got the Best Director award is unbelievable although is unsurprising when people like Martin Scorsese do not get an Oscar for films such as Raging Bull, Goodfellas and Mean Streets.",Titanic

But I never thought I'd see such terrible acting, such terrible scriptwriting, and such terribly developed characters in this highly praised winner of several Academy Awards.  Hollywood has turned to sensationalism, which isn't in itself bad, but it has turned its back on creativity.  What really was great about this movie?  Did it NEED to exist?  Movies like Citizen Kane, or Ran, or Amadeus are movies that rejoice in the possibilities of human creativity.  James Cameron made a movie that was filmed superbly with excellent special effects, but it is the product of money, not spirit.

Mr. Cameron and his crew has done a great job with the special effects.Some of the actors were good, but I'm not talking about Leo or Kate. They did an OK job, not bad but not great either. Captain Smith and the officers were made for their roles.What I dont understand, is why they had to bring in Leo and Kate? There were so many other true stories that happened onboard, but I suppose Hollywood must include ""the ultimate love story"" and a bit of sex in all their movies.Historically, I found it very good. I didn't find a single goof when I saw it, but theres always some.

1465,Sakuraa,Truly a must-see.,8,15 August 1999,"I have been fascinated by the RMS Titanic since I was 8 years old, so I had very high expectations for ""Titanic"".  I was not disappointed.  Although the script did drag its feet at times, and it was came a slight bit close to being on the trite side, Cameron has done a remarkable job of recreating what remains one of the most tragic events of the century. Despite a few historical and social inaccuracies, ""Titanic"" is fantastic--I have often (morbidly) wondered what it would have been like to be on this ship on her voyage.  Cameron's film gives one a good feel for what it must have been like, from two perspectives.Aside from the Titanic herself (the first shot of the ship in all the glory of her youth will take your breath away--literally), Kate Winslet turns in a truly wonderful performance.   Winslet breathes life and beauty into the character of Rose, and is pleasing (and easily believable) to watch. Billy Zane also does a fine job here, as do the very talented Frances Fischer and Kathy Bates.  Fisher is particularly (and frighteningly) convincing as Rose's domineering, societally-obsessed mother.Ignore all of the little-girl squeals about Leo (men, read this! LOL). ""Titanic"" is successful because it runs the viewer through the gamut of human emotion, from a joyous high to a wrenching, piteous low--and everything in between.  If anything, the special effects make ""Titanic"" truly worthwhile.",Titanic

Bad Acting- Especially Winslet and DeCaprio in their conversations on deck...insipid dialogue with acting to match.3. Cheap plot device--The tragedy was truly cheapened by the fictional romance at its center. We know enough about the real people on board for a truly fine drama, yet were stuck with these two self-absorbed losers.4. Celine Dion- 'Nuff said.",Titanic

This will surely send the signal to Hollywood that we want more big budget movies that focus more on effects than story (Godzilla, Armageddon, Lost In Space, Sphere).

Well ladies, I can tell you why - he stunk!  That year, people like Jack Nicholson and Matt Damon were nominated and for good reason, they know how to act.The rest of the cast in Titanic was brilliant.  They portrayed people from early this century.  In contrast, DiCaprio came acted like some ""aw shucks"" kid from 1997.  He didn't blend at all making his performance the weakest part of this film.

How many times is Hollywood going to make us watch that ship sink, we've seen it enough. All four movies that Titanic competed with for best picture at the Oscars were superior, espescially As Good As It Gets and the Full Monty.  Only the cries of pre-pubecent girls for the small amount of man that is Leonardo DiCaprio shot this movie to the number one money making spot of all time. I get so sick of hearing about how it is the greatest movie ever, as it boasts an unoriginal plot, weak charactor development, and a title track that could drive one to suicide.  For those of you who think it's the greatest ever, I have a few alternates, and more reasonable choices...Casablanca, The Godfather, Braveheart, Apocalypse Now, Schindler's List, The Shawshank Redemption, Star Wars, Gone With the Wind, Saving Private Ryan, etc.  I could make a list from California to New York of films that are more original and superior in everyway to the overrated Titanic.

He had absolutely no redeeming qualities which leads me to question why a girl supposedly as smart and emancipated as Rose would have anything at all to do with him. I just completely fail to understand the appeal of this movie.  Stock characters, stock situation--2200 people on board the ship and this was the best story Cameron could come up with??

When James Cameron self-proclaimed himself as the king of cinema, he effectively tied the noose around his neck. When people look upon this movie in ten years or so, they will realize with shame and embarrassment what complete fools the general public were to ever think this movie was anything besides big money.Some of the numerous bad points about this movie are as follows: special effects - made me think I was watching a computer game, therefore, not good (for a movie); acting - laughable, DiCaprio shows what a whining brat he can be; script - melodrama over a subject hardly reinvented, love between the lowly squire and rich princess?; directing - nothing extraordinary, actually, nothing UNordinary.But I suppose the masses have the final say with their wallets.

Although I wish I had Rose's wardrobe hanging in my closet, and I thought the detail was exquisite, I have to firmly disagree.  The script of this film is one of the dullest, sappiest, and most uninspired I have seen. While Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are both talented thespians, these cardboard characters leave them few options.  The patter between Jack and Rose (""Do you trust me?"" ""I trust you!"" ""You have to trust me, Rose!"" etc.) and the melodrama made the length of the film unbearable.  I have heard this film referred to as ""epic.""

The story of the Titanic tragedy might have been told in a better way ( A Night to Remember ) but it has never been and never will be told in a bigger way. A huge amount of money was spent and unlike some other films ( Waterworld ) it showed. Leonardo and Kathy Bates are excellent while the others give pretty good performances. The climax is probably the best in Hollywood history and the sets are also fantastic. Having said that , the movie is certainly not the best of all times and I doubt that it deserved the 11 Oscars. Kate certainly didn't deserve to be nominated. The movie swept away the whole world and probably the academy members also got a little carried away.

1478,jdreedatmit,Two ways to look at it,1,21 April 2003,"Titanic (1997) appears to be one of those movies that you can either love or hate.  Personally, I'm in the latter crowd.  But I have my reasons.There's no doubt that James Cameron spared no expense with sets, models and the like.  Unfortunately, it was ruined by the two ""stars"" (Winslet and DiCaprio) and their Forbidden Romance.  First of all, it's just plain not realistic.  My family worked on White Star Liners (and later Cunard) for years, on both sides of 1912, and the romance just plain wouldn't have happened.  Nor would it have been allowed to continue.  And they certainly wouldn't have allowed DiCaprio to get on the ship.Whether you like the romance, the emotion, the love, whatever, this is basically another example of Hollywood exploiting a tragedy to make a glitzy, sugary, appeals-to-the-masses movie out of it.   This could have been an excellent remake of A Night To Remember (1958) (not that it needed remaking) what with all the great sets and special effects, but instead the failed.  It's just like what they did with Pearl Harbor (2001), which was poor version of Tora Tora Tora (1970).  I think Hollywood has learned their lesson by now.  But if you want cheesy, not terribly believeable romance set against the backdrop of some of our century's worst tragedies, go see Titanic (1997) and Pearl Harbor (2001).  If you want to see well-executed movies about these tragic events, see Night To Remember, A (1958) and Tora! Tora! Tora! (1970)",Titanic

1482,Salieri-3,The greatest thing made by the hands of man,8,19 August 1999,"Not only is ""Titanic"" the greatest film ever made, it is truly the greatest thing made by the hands of man. This comment is limited to 1,000 words - I would need a limitless page to explain why. But I will say this. The Titanic represented everything that the people of 1912 hoped that this century would be like. It represented the illusion that we had finally conquered nature. But we were wrong. When Billy Zane says, 'It is unsinkable - God himself could not sink this ship' - you can almost see, high above the clouds, God saying 'Oh yeah? We'll see about that!' ""Titanic"" - the movie - is not only a mesmerising, beautifully made, heart-wrenching, uncompromisingly realistic film, but it is a true meditation on not only mankind's progress through this century (which began at the end of the gilded age and is now finishing at the dawn of the digital age), and on the human condition itself. James Cameron, having established himself as the action maestro with ""Aliens"" and ""T2"", finally proved not only that he was willing to totally defy and redefine the auteur theory, to ignore the cynics and the unfathomable opinions of people who think that ""A Night to Remember"" is the definitive account of the disaster (calling planet earth, do you think that on a sinking ship without enough lifeboats for everyone, everything would be done in a smooth, cool, calm, orderly fashion? Eh?), and forget about codes, conventions and 'film theory', in order to make the film the way he saw fit, but that he is a human being. When Steven Spielberg made ""Schindler's List"" (in my opinion the #2 film of all time), it was a big break, considering among other things the fact that he had just finished ""Jurassic Park"", but he had made real human dramas before - ""The Color Purple"" and ""Empire of the Sun"". Cameron had shown that action movies could have real production values, but a true human drama was a totally new thing. The film HAD to be made before this century was out. I was only two when Cameron's big break - ""The Terminator"" was released, but I can imagine a lot of people thinking that this man would be the one to make THE Titanic movie (technology versus mankind, anyone?). As well as the powerful messages (more than you're likely to find in a state-of-the-art digital communication system), the film has unchallengably breathtaking grandeur, awe-inspiring beauty, an excellent cast, a moving storyline, and totally absorbing AND thought-provoking entertainment. When Cameron and fellow producer Jon Landau received the Best Picture Academy Award last year, the final moment was the moment Cameron had been building up to throughout his career. He summarised what the film meant to him, and spoke as human being, not as a Hollywood director, when he called for a moment's silence in honour of the 1,500 men, women and children who went down with the ship. By faithfully recreating the disaster and giving it mass appeal in uncountable ways, Cameron has made a document of the human condition, the 20th century and what it brought about, and social, moral and technological progress that will surely stand the test of time, and, maybe, one day, when those snobbish critics have a 'live life to the full, you never know when it could end' experience, will make them realise that ""Citizen Kane"" (excellent but overrated) is NOT the greatest film ever made. But then, we are all human beings, and we are all different, and the right to freedom of expression is a right we all should have - one of the film's many messages. Perfect freedom does not exist, but we can be free from oppression if we let other people and exterior forces work with us. In ""Titanic"", the ship in question represents Rose's gilded cage, and the limitations of her society, but, ultimately, it (she, sorry) becomes her means of salvation - both in that it/she brings her to Jack, and in that it/she sinks, therefore changing the lives of all the survivors. Dramatic license works its wonders in the scene when Jack and Rose go up on deck having just been 'doing it' in the car, Rose decides that she is going to forsake her money and her family and get off at New York with Jack, she kisses him, the lookouts look down and see them - but when they look ahead, what do they see? The rest is history. Although many critics were critical of this film, the fact that it is both the most popular AND the most honoured film of all time is a testimony to the value we place upon our freedom, and upon life itself. Not a day goes by when I don't think about the awesome wonder of that film, neither will I ever forget how it changed my life. Every time I watch it I notice something new. James Cameron is the greatest artist in the history of mankind. Dedication, passion and commitment were taken to new levels with ""Titanic"". I could go on forever, you know!",Titanic
1483,moop96,"Wretched ""love"" story inflicts 300 foot gash",5,19 March 2004,"I really did not want to see another version of the ""Titanic"" story on film, because there already were two superb versions, both made in the fifties. I went anyway, as this one was hard to avoid, you might say. I found the story on the ship quite annoying, tailored with shallowness, and aimed smack-dab at the Blockbuster potential: Teenagers.I was disappointed by the depiction of a ""romance"" that would have NEVER happened in 1912. A young woman masquerading as a socialite? Becoming interested in (and getting naked for) a steerage passenger? Sleeping with him on the ship? Flipping the bird and spitting? Really? in 1912 ??? Wow, James, you have quite an imagination.Technically, the film is hard to fault, but it just seems to lack in suspense. There are some fake looking computer generated moments. The most serious flaw - how anyone could spend 3 minutes (never mind 30 minutes in the film) - in freezing seawater in the bowels of the ship, and somehow make it all the way to the stern to jump off? COME ON! I would encourage those who share my views to check out these two classics instead:A Night to Remember (1958) A definitive British minute-by-minute docudrama that has rightly stood the test of time. Titanic (1953) A great Hollywood version (the OLD Hollywood) which I could not even find a mention in these reviews. It did a superb job of depicting a troubled and ultimately doomed romance on the great ship. I can actually say this version ""puts you on the ship"" more than the 1997 version. It featured a great story, believable characters (unlike this version) played to perfection by some of Hollywood's best. Not to mention an unforgettably sad Father-Son moment at the end. It featured special effects way ahead of their time, which still look pretty impressive today. But it is literally forgotten, save for a 'Studio Classics' DVD release. It certainly makes me wonder why Cameron needed to spend a gazillion dollars on SFX, put in such a LAME unbelievable story, and get more awards than the 1953 version. Those who get anal about some of the technical details on the earlier films (such as for instance the ship not breaking in half) seem to miss the point. This Titanic must have caught the Academy sleeping.",Titanic

It contains boaring scenes, bad acting on the part of Leo, and unbelivable romances. I don't understand why this movie was so loved. Young girls may enjoy Leo, but I feel that he is totally over rated and a horrible actor. When I first saw him in What's Eating Gilbert Grape, he was remarkable. What happened?

1487,sfbigguy43,Dead in the water,2,9 April 2001,"An interviewer recently asked Woody Allen why he doesn't attend the Academy Awards presentation. ""Those people give Oscars to films like Titanic,"" he replied.Other than The Biggest Show on Earth, Titanic is probably the worst film ever to receive a best picture Oscar. Sure, a godzillion people went to see it and took in more money than do most small nations, but that doesn't mean it's good or even watchable. Independence Day and Wild, Wild West both made scads of money and both stunk to high heaven.The damn boat does not start to sink until an hour and a half into the movie and when it does, the film shifts to level of awfulness that is eclipsed only by the stunningly unbelievable slop that comprises its first half. What can you say about a picture that focuses obsessively on capturing the look of the ship's interior, the clothing of the passengers, even the dinnerware off of which the passengers eat, yet completely flubs the actual story of the sinking? James Cameron obviously did not believe that the loss at sea of the most famous ship of the 20th century presented an interesting enough story to modern (American), so he proceeded to distort the historical record with his own purely fictional dramatic flourishes. As huge water cannon hose down those expensive sets, he gooses up the drama by staging a gunfight in the first class lounge. This occurs after 1) Kate saves Leo from  certain drowning by applying an ax to the handcuffs that chain him to a water pipe (ironic, huh?) 2) the two jointly rescue an abandoned waif inexplicably separated from its momma 3) Kate tells her upper class snob boyfriend to stuff it because she'd prefer drowning with Leo to a seat next to him in a lifeboat.Very climatic.The film does provide some great camp moments, for example when Kate presents to her insensitive beast fiance a little bauble she's picked up in Montmartre, Picasso's The Desmoiselles d'Avignon (hey, didn't this go down with the ship?). And when the big vessel is about to slide into the freezing North Atlantic, Kate gets weepy and nostalgic as she hangs for dear life off the stern, ""Jack, this is where we first met!""The ending is ludicrous and not only because there are survivorsIf you want to view a GOOD movie about the Titanic, try A Night to Remember or even the Barbara Stanwyck version, both from the 1950's. Both made for less than 150 million bucks each, even adjusted for inflation. Imagine.

1488,fambright,"Very Good, But Not Great",8,29 March 2000,"Titanic is one of the few movies in recent times on which the film academy and the public seemed to agree.  It won more Oscars than any other movie but Ben Hur, and had a box office take that topped even the first Star Wars movie.  So you'd expect it to be the greatest movie of all time.Unfortunately, it isn't.  It's certainly a very good movie.  It has great special effects (though, if that's what you're looking for, the Star Wars movies and Jurassic Park are better).  And it brought home the magnitude of the Titanic disaster (when in recent times have we had a single disaster that killed 1500 people?).  And it has a haunting theme song.  But it fell short of what it could have been.The situation of the movie was an immensely interesting one:  You have a ship that's going down in icy waters.  There's no rescue in sight.  There aren't nearly enough life boats.  So it's inevitable that a lot of people are going to die in a rather unpleasant way, and they know this for over an hour before it happens.  How would people react in a situation like that?This is the sort of thing that fiction could never tell you.  You can probably figure out that some people would be heroic while others would be cowardly, that some would be selfless while others would be selfish.  But most interesting of all are the reactions you'd never expect.  And, to the extent that the movie told those real life stories, it was excellent.Unfortunately, the real life stories were obscured by a fictional plot which bore an uncomfortable similarity to ""Romeo and Juliet"" and which employed so many stereotypes that it was hard to take it seriously.  (Virtually ALL of lower class passengers, e.g., are portrayed as coarse but good-hearted people, while nearly all of the upper class passengers are portrayed as selfish snobs.)Even with its flaws, I'd still recommend seeing this movie, if you haven't already.  But, with all of its Oscars and with its record setting box office take, I feel compelled to add a caution:  It's NOT the best movie of all time, as you might expect it to be from the hype!",Titanic

Why James would turn it into one is beyond.he missed the point totally on what Titanic was. A story of Disaster that could have been prevented.

1495,ssoracoe,Triumph in Tradgedy: Titanic,9,23 February 2001,"Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic.  The plot is simple, noncomplicated, or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense. The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film, but the love story is an interesting one, however.  Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose, an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal (Billy Zane). Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game.  If he wants something, he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries.  The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyes.The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures, that sunk with the Titanic, which has recently occurred.  One of the survivors of the Titanic, Rose DeWitt Bukater, who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search.  She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic.  With this, the scene shifts to Southhampton, Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10, 1912 as all the passengers are boarding.  After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York. Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful, but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger, Jack Dawson. Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned.  Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirty-two years of experience to stretch the Titanic's legs out to full speed.  The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs, but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie.  On April 15, 1912 at 11:39, an iceberg was sighted.  They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film.  The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate.  The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 2:18 when the lights finally failed.  The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanic's many pleas for help.  The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own.  The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship.  Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too. The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking.  Also, the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold, which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle.  Overall, the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanic.Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship.  The core group of Rose, Jack, Cal, and Rose's mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time.  Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown; Captain Edward Smith; the ship designer, Thomas Andrew; the White Star Line Representative, Bruce Ismay; and all of the Titanic's officers were real.  The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smith's last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards.  He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaire's Captain when the Titanic sunk.  The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol.  He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officer's former Canadian hometown. As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lower-class passengers from non-English speaking nations.  In addition, Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted.  The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss'.  Not wanting to leave her husband's side Mrs. Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic.  Furthermore, Mr. Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best.  The richest man on the ship, John Jacob Astor, who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well, but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat. In addition, Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water.  Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over four-thousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke.  All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware. The gymnasium, which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs.  The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent re-creation of the Post-Victorian era of 1912.  The rich at this time practically ruled everything, as the women's suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet.  Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do.  The rich did not take well to `new money' such as Molly Brown as depicted.  Everything of the time was very formal.  Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes. Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes, which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie.  Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes. Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society. Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent cross-referencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken.  The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtaking.A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise.  The director, James Cameron, shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in people's lives.  Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night.  In addition, this film is a reflection of the 1990's when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic.  Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored.  This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed.  However, the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed.  There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed.  As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matter.
Technically the film is very well done.  To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie.  In addition, a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean.  Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship.  Furthermore, throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage.  This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner.  At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the film.Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art, a true epic.  Like most history novels, we know the ending, but it doesn't take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture. Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming, sound, cintematography, and editing.  If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900's and how they face disaster, then this movie definitely is for you.",Titanic

It doesn't work. The movie was not art in anyway.

To this junk get all those Oscars is a crime. How could something like this win over Gandhi and The Last Emperor. Those are art films that didnt need a huge budget.

Mainly in dialogue (occasionally) but this film is wildly entertaining and thus being a 3 hour movie it doesn't really stagger. You feel the true journey of the ship and not just it's final moments above water. Leo and Kate are great in this. King Kathy bates is also perfect. The set, costumes, make up, music, visuals/cinematography, directing all wonderful. It's a great classic film that presents itself as powerful as the ship appeared to be. Even though the ending isn't what a Leo fan girl wants it does allow you to feel more of what the survivors feel wondering if their loved ones survived or if they knew they hadn't. James Cameron is always ambitious with his films but this one is distinguishing. Not the best love story ever but defiantly an iconic one. Knowing how much time and love James Cameron put into making this film and researching it makes you appreciate the film so much more.",Titanic
1512,frankmackey16,An unsinkable ship goes down and kills a young love story,6,5 December 2001,"Well, here we are four years later looking back at the phenomenon thatwas Titanic. I was in sixth grade when it was released, and I wassurrounded by hundreds of young girls seeing it seven times in a rowjust to get a long look at Leo. And this movie won best picture. Thetruth is that Leonardo DiCaprio is not a very good actor. He's no betterthan the other teenybopper actors out there like Freddie Prinze Jr. orRyan Phillipe. I mean look at the movie he made right after this, TheBeach.Back to the film itself. It's simply a love story that we've seencountless times, attached to a horrible tragedy. That's all. Why so manycritics and audiences fell for this is something I'll never understand.It was simply a one-hit wonder. Just about every single person I knowwho liked that movie back when it was in theaters barely even thinkabout it anymore. As for James Cameron, he's one of the most egotisticalpeople in Hollywood. When the guy shouted that he was the ""king of theworld"" at the Oscars, that's when I knew that he doesn't care a jotabout anything other than cash. Not to mention his appearance onSaturday Night Live when he lit his cigar with a burning hundred dollarbill. He takes a horrible tragedy, a film that could've lasted about twohours or so, and pastes in a formulaic, cliched love story to boost itup to 3:14.If you're one of the few people out there who still hasn't seen thisfilm, I say just skip the middle section and just go to the sinking ofthe ship. That is the only place where you will get any of the intensityand suspense that this film deserves. I think that half of thepassengers who died on the Titanic would've been embarres",Titanic
1513,Grammykins,pu!,1,18 May 2006,"What a stinker! I know that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is a private club and only members can vote for Oscars. We, the viewing public, buy our tickets and have our opinions. I have watched the Oscars show on TV since they first let us in on their big night. It is fun to watch the show and hope for our favorites, but it is not a peoples' choice award show. I have been disappointed many times and happy many times with the winners of the coveted prize. But never so disappointed and shocked at the the winning of 11 Oscars for ""Titanic"" One Oscar for special effects, maybe, but the other 10, ridiculous. The blue heart.. Yikes!

1514,Movie_Finder,A sensational movie,10,6 February 2005,"I have heard many negative comments about this movie. ""the acting was terrible"" or ""the movie lacks suspense."" While the movie is considerably long and may seem boring to some, there is no denying that ""Titanic"" is a masterpiece. The acting is very decent and those who claim that Leonardo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet ""can't act"" must have some sort of personal vendetta against them because they do a very convincing job in the movie; especially in their very precious scenes together.The special/sound effects used are very good and give the film a great sense of context and realism - like you are actually there in the Titanic. The score is very fitting and really does elicit feelings of sorrow, joy and excitement for the characters of the film. Although I am not a fan of her other work, Celin Dion's Grammy award winning ""My Heart Will Go On"" must be one of the saddest, most touching songs ever produced.The ending of ""Titanic"" might have you feeling quite sad, but you will likely also have feelings of triumph and inspiration for certain characters. Despite the fact that nobody can understand the true pain experienced by those of the actual events, after watching the movie one will feel a deeper connection with the whole Titanic tragedy.To all those people who have made a habit of putting this movie down by stating immature and unreasonable comments, I have this to say: 11 Academy Awards AND $1.8b made at the worldwide box office! 10/10.",Titanic

I've seen that movie many times, and I always watch the last few minutes with tears in my eyes and a lump in my throat.",Titanic
1517,dr_shallowgrave,Decent Drama with brilliant Sets,9,30 October 2004,"Titanic is a fair work from director James Cameron. Sometimes being called on the carpet for it's naive plot and dialogue, this movie had the rare merit of reuniting the public and the critics in an unanimous way: James Cameron's Titanic is an effective work to be remembered. This does not happen so often. For several weeks, this movie had the privilege to score brilliantly on the top charts, as well as conquering major movie awards around the world. Is it fair? Was it overrated? That does not matter, if we accept it for what it stands. It worked perfectly. The artwork is ostentatious and the acting if not perfect is adequate and balanced with the strength of the script written by Cameron himself. Leonardo DiCaprio gives the necessary honesty to the role, while Kate Winslet grants the wit, elegance and grace that a romantic and troubled heroin should have. Miss Winslet was without any doubt the finest actress for the role. Apart from the supremacy of the visual effects, which are the main core of this movie for most of its viewers, Titanic dazzles for the truth and sensibility present in every single detail in every scene. More than a parade of mere flash-backs from an old lady who once was ""a dish"", this movie is a fine drama made with a solid sense of loyalty and respect for the viewer. You know what happens before you pay for your ticket. You know it is a love story set on a transatlatic and you know people will die. What matters, most of all, is the possibility Cameron gives you to imagine what might have been if you had the chance to find true love under the most ungrateful circumstances. 8 out of 10 for Cameron's sensibility and courage to write a story without having any previous experience as a screen-writer; 10/10 for a brilliant Kate Winslet, a beautiful and talented British actress who proved that acting skills do not have nationality nor beauty patterns. I had fun watching it. It made me feel like I was sharing the inner conflicts felt by the main characters. For its truth and audacity to tell a story already told a thousand times, I bow with respect.9/10",Titanic

That being said.I believe this film is as close as you can get to a perfect film. I wish people would appreciate the craft of this film even if it's not your story.

But then, when I saw it on the night of my birthday I just LOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOVED it!!! I cried for about half the film! (I love films that give emotions, that make me cry or... feel anxious or anything to keep me concentrated to the story in an even paranoiac kind of way) And I just loved it... This is the film that changed my life!!! And when I saw the vote that the users put on this website I nearly fainted!!! Absolutely NOT right! This is the first film with Kate Winslet in it that I saw... And I haven't stopped yet! I think both her and Leonardo DiCaprio are wonderful actors and it seemed like a very fun film to do! LOVED IT!!!!!",Titanic
1520,jehan21,"Epitome of badly written, overbudgeted trash",3,13 March 2008,"This movie, despite the inordinate quantity of rewards it received, combines clichés and stilted dialogue to produce a passable effort. However, the length makes it excessively tedious. The script was badly written to the extent that the high points of the movie were the mammeries of Kate Winslet and the death of Leonardo's character, which provides some elation as the movie is, at that point, bound to roll the credits and leave you in piece. The special effects were an achievement, but the nauseating level of self-conscious sentimentalism that underpinned the movie burdened these scenes and leave you wondering why you should be compelled to care. The overall message is the same ""love conquers all"" message with a very familiar method. Highly recommended for those who suffer insomnia.",Titanic

1522,famous_a_2000,It Saddens Me that This Story.....Not Jack & Rose.....Was True!!,9,3 January 2021,"This movie is without questioned great!! I find myself looking at it more than once; looking at the highlights; intrigued with the story as if I were there (thank GOD that I wasn't!!) I also rooted for Jack and Rose. Rose didn't love Cal. Rose was being pressured to marry him. A big message was being sent when we see Rose ready to kill herself because of how trapped she was. Her mom was pressuring her for one. Like Jack, ""I know how the world works"" when a man has nothing to offer a woman.....especially when he's compared to a man who can give her the world. But, just like the movie with a similar storyline, The Notebook, a woman like Rose has to ask herself ""what do you want?"" Like so many others I was glad to see Jack win Rose over. But unlike so many others, Jack's death didn't sadden me the most. Normally after living through and watching a big drama like this his death would have saddened me the most. But unlike so many I haven't forgotten that this is so true of a story!! Jack and Rose didn't exist. But Capt. Smith, the band, Isador & Ida Krauss, Thomas Andrews, and other characters who died on screen in the sinking did.....and so did 1500 plus people back in 1912. That so saddens me more; especially since it seems like the poorer passengers weren't able to get on a life boat. Molly Brown also existed. And researching real life coverage, Molly Brown really did want to go back and see if she could rescue more. I honor all of those who perished. The love story that should have been told should be that of the Krauss': Isador and Ida. Ida could have boarded a life boat be she didn't want to live with out her true love of many many years. I write this review because I was surprised to see, on YouTube, the high number of people who acted like they were more sad about Jack's death than anything! Still an awesome movie about a serious piece of history.",Titanic

The end of this film is the only thing worth watching and the only part I would watch if I ever got round to this film again. 3 for the beginning and 8 for the end would be my votes if I could split. This film would fall into the same category for me as Pearl Harbor, which has some of the best special effects I have seen during the attack scene but again the film is less than a masterpiece when all elements are combined.",Titanic
1524,HelloNeighbour,Undisputably beautiful reflected in it's popularity and the awards received.,9,19 August 2008,"Where do you start with this film? Possibly one of the only films I have watched regularly since it was released. A fairly simple but dramatic plot that coincides with the story of a sinking of the biggest ship of its time that has made such a huge impact on history.Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are absolutely perfect for these amazingly-crafted roles. Kate Winslet's role once again proves her versatility from film to film and it has to be said this is one of her best movies. A young Leonardo DiCaprio also brings such a charm to Jack that every woman watching the film cannot help but fall in love with him themselves! The fictional storyline based around a non-fictional historical event is truly heart-warming for a short time before it quickly becomes heart-wrenching. The first half of the film is calmly amusing for the audience as Jack and Rose discover their love despite their profoundly different backgrounds. The second half however is dramatically darker as circumstances threaten their love and their struggle to keep a grasp on each other and their new found connection brings a lump to the throat. It is not a airy-fairy happy ending - quite the opposite. Instead the majority of the audience are crying with the injustice that the pair suffer but there is also an element of acceptance.What I find personally pleasing is that the engaging storyline does not detract from the horrors of the night the Titanic sunk in 1912. This film not only does the sinking and the traumatic loss of lives justice, but also has included enthralling acting of the fictional storyline.There will always be many who find this film 'boring' and 'cheesy' as with all films - but the astounding amount of awards and fame it has achieved truly portrays the feelings of every person who has fallen in love with this film.",Titanic
1525,gregjudy-1,High Expectations Dashed By Bad Acting And Writing,8,4 May 2012,"The movie ""Titanic"", written, directed, and produced by James Cameron centers on the sinking of the RMS Titanic, while also focusing on a fictitious love story between two forbidden loves. Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) is a 17 year-old first class passenger who is engaged to be married to Pittsburgh steel magnate Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Although she says she loves Cal, Rose feels pressured by her mother (Frances Fisher) into marrying him. Rose's mother acknowledges the fact that the marriage is a way to solve the family's secret financial problems. Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a poor artist who wins a ticket aboard the Titanic in a poker match. Rose first meets Jack when he saves her from throwing herself overboard in an act of suicide. This rapidly starts a love affair between the two. A common theme in this movie is the contrasting differences between the first and third class passengers. The first class passengers are made to appear ignorant, arrogant, and self-centered, while the third class passengers are kind, charitable, and altruistic. While this may have been true of some first class passengers, others were very generous, giving up their seat on the lifeboat for those who needed it. I feel that the story played too much into the greed of the upper-class.This movie is a good movie in many ways. The direction, music, production, camera-work, and set creation are especially good, as is the acting by Kate Winslet. However, I was not very pleased with the work of the other actors/actresses, especially that of Gloria Stuart, who received an Academy Award nomination for her role as an elderly Rose. Her acting was cheesy and mediocre, yet she earned a nomination due to the hype surrounding the film at the time of its release. The screenplay was also lacking. Although the dialogue is pretty good, the lines are unbelievably predictable and corny. I expected better from a James Cameron film.Overall, I guess I had extremely high expectations going into this movie (wouldn't anyone?), and my hopes were dashed by bad acting and writing.",Titanic
1526,otr91,Titanic masterpiece: an emotional and visual thrill ride,10,31 August 2015,"Titanic is one of my all time favourite films. I'm a 24 year old guy who has probably not cried in front of anyone since I was a kid, but this movie plays on my emotions more than almost any other. We all know the ship will sink (does that even qualify as a spoiler?) but the build-up to this event - the smugness and over- confidence, assurances of it being ""unsinkable"" - tease the audience, almost to the point where you're like 'is it really going to sink?'I thought the performances of everyone were magnificent: I cared about the characters and their lives on and beyond the ship. Taking the time to introduce everyone and weave their stories together was masterful, even beyond the main characters, like Fabrizio and Murdoch the First Officer and countless more. It was heartbreaking towards the end when you see the panic gradually set in, and it slowly descends into total chaos. You remember Jack telling Rose all the places he's going to take her to and you imagine their love- filled lives together. The Irish mother telling her children the fairytale, resigned to their fate. The violinists trying to maintain a spirit of composure amidst the carnage. And the music! Wow. I cried for all of this. And especially right at the end when you see the photos of Rose's life, knowing she's fulfilled her promise and survived, living a full life, probably never having met anyone she loved as much as Jack all those years ago.Visually pleasing in every way, dramatic, musically astounding, great acting and above all a fantastic story make this an undeniably iconic, enduring film. A romantic-drama unlike any other. It deserves higher than 7.7.",Titanic
1527,genstarzz,"Not a masterpiece, but still a very enjoyable film",8,3 October 2013,"Titanic was a big departure from the previous films director James Cameron had created. Films like The Terminator, Terminator 2, and Aliens are all sci-fi action CLASSICS and are some of my favorite movies. He had also directed True Lies, a solid action film, but not quite as intriguing, creative or original as the other films I mentioned. He also made The Abyss, which was enjoyable yet forgettable in my opinion. Overall, Cameron really shines and delivers when it comes to making Sci- fi action films that take themselves seriously.Then Titanic came along. It was his first major film that was not science fiction nor action related. In a sense, Titanic tries to be to Cameron what Schindler's list was to Spielberg. This was Cameron's opportunity to show he had matured and can make a sophisticated film. A film based on a historical event without any elements of fantasy with great performances and emotional depth. Unfortunately, Titanic does not quite reach the levels of greatness that Schindler's list had.Sad to say, after seeing this movie it is clear that Cameron isn't as versatile as Spielberg and should stick to a specific genre for best results. Not to say Titanic is awful. It is by no means a bad film, however it's not quite a classic because it suffers from being generic at times. Everything relating to the special effects, the sets, the costumes, etc. are not generic. They are all incredibly done and clearly overseen by a great director. What makes the movie generic are the things that separate it from Cameron's previous films: The love story.If you took away all the thing mentioned above: the great sets, the great visual effects and so on and took everything away from the movie that had to do with the titanic, you would have nothing left but very cliché, by the book characters, plot and dialogue. Jack and Rose's relationship had nothing particularly new or innovative about it at all. Two people in love separated by social class is a story that's been told over and over again ever since Romeo and Juliet.We've seen this story many times. This would be forgivable, if it wasn't for the fact that it's the core of the movie! Star Wars, in a way does something similar: it takes a story that everybody is familiar with and puts it in a bigger, larger than life setting. However, what gave Star Wars more of a punch than Titanic was that the characters were far more unique and memorable. Take Darth Vader for example and compare him to Caledon Hockley from Titanic. Cal is a character that we've seen in many silly high school comedies: the douche bag with a broom up his ass that we all want to see get his comeuppance at the end.Darth Vader on the other hand, was nothing like any villain we've seen before and became a cultural icon. I'm not saying every character has to become a part of pop culture for the movie to be good, I'm just saying that that's what's keeping Titanic from being a masterpiece in my opinion. I will say, however, that the film is still really shines during certain parts. The sinking of the Titanic was emotional, yet jaw dropping to watch. The sets were also great, and although I think Jack and Rose might be a bit generic and even a little boring, they are still likable overall and it's sad when Jack dies at the end.Overall, the movie is over rated, however I still consider it worth watching and entertaining. It's just destined to be compared with other films that reach a higher level of originality and storytelling because well, it's the second highest grossing film of all time. As far as Avatar is concerned, that film even suffers from generic storytelling even more than this one, and I feel that it's a bit of a shame that Cameron had clung to closely to cliché characters and plot lines",Titanic

That really annoys me, but other than that, everything is brilliant. The first half of the movie is well acted by everybody, the cinematography is beautiful throughout, it's all great. The second half of the movie is utter brilliance beyond belief. I was almost crying watching that ship sink. James Cameron is a genius.

James Cameron showed us that the heart can go on after losing someone we love.Jack and Rose(DiCaprio,Winslet)Are two great film characters that will go down in movie history. THIS FILM IS UP THERE WITH ""GONE WITH THE WIND"".IT WAS TRULY A MOVING EXPERIENCE!!!!!! 10/10",Titanic
1532,nkanalley,"I'm sorry I didn't build 'ya a better ship, young Rose. . .",8,29 July 2012,"Okay, so let's start with the bad. The script is mostly atrocious. Key characters are cardboard, one dimensional cartoons that are little more than plot devices. The score can be incredibly overwrought and overdone. James Cameron, while a skilled director, is also one of the most ego maniacal people in the industry, as his infamous Oscar acceptance speech testifies. The final shots of the film should have been left on the cutting room floor, and don't even get me started on Celine Dion. Blech.And yet, for all it's predictability, triteness and recurrent sickly-sweetness, Titanic works, and works well.Why? I can't really answer that question except to say that this particular love story, which spans an unbridgeable class divide and nearly nine decades, is, for all it's flaws, immensely satisfying. 17 year old Rose (Kate Winslet), of an aristocratic but recently impoverished Philadelphia society family, is heading home to America after taking in the ""Grand Tour"" of Europe with her fiancée, a Pennsylvania steel tycoon (Billy Zane). Trapped in a (soon to be) arranged marriage and deeply depressed, she attempts suicide by jumping off the bow of Titanic, but not before being talked out of such drastic action by a young drifter from third class named Jack Dawson (Leo Dicaprio, in the part which rocketed him to super stardom overnight). The story that follows is predictable, but never boring. It speaks to our deepest desires and most poignant longings. The love affair between Jack and Rose is the kind of love that, by it's very definition, cannot end happily, and at the same time you completely believe that the experience of those 48 hours with Jack have transformed Rose forever and for good. There's a fairy tale quality to the romance, sure. But what's wrong with that? The story of Jack and Rose is perfectly integrated into the dramatization of the most famous night of the 20th century, the last two hours in the life of the ""unsinkable"" R.M.S Titanic. A marvel of engineering in it's own time, and still so today, the White Star Line's Titanic (and her sisters Olympic and Brittanic) stood at the forefront of the technological revolution of the 20th century, well before humanity developed the means to annihilate itself with the atom bomb. Titanic and her sister ships belong to an era which imagined a world of endless, benign possibility, where Man might eradicate all nature's obstacles and reign supreme over the earth. Man would become, in short, a kind of God. And then came April 14th, 1912, and a meeting with destiny given form in an iceberg.James Cameron is fascinated by this night in the frigid North Atlantic, and it shows. The last hour and a half of the film is a close as we'll ever get to a time machine sent back a century to the horrific early morning hours that saw the leviathan plunge over two miles to the ocean floor, and 1502 souls expire in the subzero waters of the Atlantic ocean. While Jack and Rose are fictional, they allow Cameron to remind us, without delving into the ""historically correct"" trap that would have hindered him if he'd followed the story of one of the historical characters, to experience the desolation of those who survived, while those they loved froze and fell into the void below. The horrible beauty of that frigid, clear Atlantic night is vividly evoked. The most beautiful scenes in the film, in my opinion, are in the last 15 minutes, as Cameron allows his tragic story to play out in that eternally cold, unforgiving icy water (in reality a five foot deep swimming pool, but such is the effects budget that you'd never know), the stars blazing like torches in the sky. This is one of the few films that bring me to ""that place"", where, no matter how hard I try, I can't help but tear up. Sissel's vocals in this part of the film are Oscar worthy The bookends of the film, involving a subplot about salvager's looking for a rare diamond believed to have gone down with the ship, allow us to see the end of Rose's story, and provide us with an immensely satisfying sense of closure.In the end, I think the film succeeded so well because it provided two apparently contradictory things to it's audiences. Firstly, it allows us to feel the pathos of this heartrending event, and it so doing, encourages empathy with all human tragedy. Secondly, it allows us to dream of experiencing whatever it is that Jack and Rose had for those brief 48 hours . Most of us will never know what that ""thing"" is like. But we all hope to experience it, whether we'll ever admit to it it or not.",Titanic

I know, bummer, right? :-( I think maybe James Cameron was up against a deadline and ran out of time to write and film a more believable ending. So he took the easy way out and just sank the ship. ( Oh, please. Hits an iceberg? Like THAT could really happen. Sheesh, give us a break! ) All in all an OK film, ... up until then. But the ending is a real downer (or is that 'drowner'?) Maybe the ""Titanic 2"" sequel will be better; or at least Cameron could release a ""Director's Cut Edition"" without the total buzz-kill ending. It's a wonder that any movie studio considered this film 'commercial', given the near absence of explosions and car crashes? There are only a couple of explosions in the whole movie ( ship's boilers, yawn ...), and there are no car crashes at all. In fact, the closest thing to a car crash is an antique car in the ship's hold, with the two lead actors in a little steam-up-the-windows backseat action. Seriously, I'm not kidding! ( palm to forehead, shake head and groan ""CLICHE' ALERT!"" ) ... They LITERALLY ""steam-up the windows"". Good grief! Fortunately there is some gratuitous nudity; although the actress exposing her 'lady-bits' clearly weighs-in at well over 100 pounds, ... and I think we all would agree that's just wrong!!! In the ""Director's Cut Edition"" Cameron should Photoshop a few pounds off the actress, and redo that scene in 3-D ( and maybe the 'nekkid' actress could be painted blue, and sport pointy ears and a tail! ) And it would be great if Cameron could add a parallel storyline that the lead character, ""Jack"", is actually the great-grandfather of John Connor, and at the last possible moment great-grandson Connor, hotly pursued by a homicidal cyborg Terminator, travels back in time through a wormhole, lands on the foredeck of Titanic and fires a couple of missiles and blows up the iceberg. Small pieces of iceberg rain down all over the deck, and it's celebratory on-the-rocks cocktails for everyone! Cue the music, ... fade to black. Now THAT would make for a 'commercial' Hollywood film. :-)",Titanic

1540,batterypark123,Over-hyped?,9,30 January 2012,"I find it so amazing that even after all these years, we are STILL talking about this movie! Obviously this movie wasn't THAT bad or else people wouldn't even BOTHER to talk about it. I personally enjoyed this film immensely, and still do! I guess this film isn't for everyone, but it certainly did touch the hearts of many.As for those that think that this film is ""overrated"" or ""over-hyped""...well, we only have the movie-going public to thank for that! lol* You see, it's not CRITICS/article writers that make a film ""HUGE"" or a ""HIT"" with the general movie-going public. PEOPLE make the film a huge success. With Titanic, everyone was in awe. Let's face it, a film like this had never been made before. At least not with the type of special effects needed to really capture the essence of the ship actually sinking. This film is so accurate that even James Cameron timed the actual sinking of the ship in the film with the REAL sinking that fateful day in April 1912. Even the silverware for goodness sakes matched! Give this movie a break you guys! The critics thought this movie would sink BIG time! When this movie actually came out and people started hearing by WORD OF MOUTH (which is the BEST form of advertisement mind you) that this was a good/decent/movie worth seeing, then everyone started flocking to the theaters in droves to see this movie...not once, not twice, but maybe 3 times and more! So, I really wouldn't say that this movie was ""overhyped""...at least not like the buildup for the MATRIX reloaded or the HULK is being ""overhyped"". ha! Critics didn't even think that Titanic would make enough money to cover Cameron's gigantic film budget that it took to make this mammoth of a film. However, the films money took care of that 200 million budget and MUCH more! Personally, I LOVE this film. However, this film might not be for everyone. DOn't say that this film sucks just because of romance though! THat is the most sexist thing I've ever heard! Disliking a movie just because it has romance in it! The story was sweet. The dialogue could have been better, but let's face it...the REAL star of the movie wasn't Leo or Kate...it was that GIGANTIC Ship! I think all of the actors including DiCaprio and Winslet did a fine job. It's not their best work (I've seen much BETTER work from both of them) but it wasn't the WORST I've seen on screen before. Give them a break!",Titanic

IF you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. The rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. I am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. It was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. It is the most amazing love story ever attempted. I know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. Someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! How lame is that? It made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. I will gladly side with the majority this time around. Okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, I am done.",Titanic
1542,o-fosnes,Titanic,10,24 October 2015,I really love this movie. Leo and Kate is great in this movie. I've watched this movie with commentaries and i like the way James Cameron tells about what really happened in 1912 and what life was like at that time. I love all the rooms in the boat that they have made exactly as in the real Titanic. I love the scenes when all the rooms come underwater and the deleted scene when leo and lovejoy fight in the dining room. Its the longest scene ever taken out of a movie. I also like the simulation of the boat when its underwater.It's my favorite movie with Leonardo dicapro and Kate winslet.,Titanic

Not sure how this film has got such a low rating. Leo and Kate in star making turns, and Billy Zane still makes me laugh with his ridiculous caricature of a villain. Rose is displeased...what to do?'",Titanic
1545,kazzam,"titanic: visuals rock,script lacks",7,21 July 2004,"Titanic is a romantic tear-jerker set in 1912, based on, of course, the ill fated voyage. Leo Dicaprio and Katen Winslet play two young lovers(leo, a little too young looking)aboard the unsinkable ship.The relationship between Leo and Kate felt a little rushed at times, but I suppose they had to skip to the most predictable part of the movie, when the ship sank.James Cameron spent 200mil. making this flick, so yes the visuals of the sinking ship are spectacular. You go back and forth between the suspencefull scenes, seeing leo and kate trying to escape the ship from the inside(cameron at his best). And the eye candy moments of seeing helpless passengers falling off the ship that's suspended in mid air.Sure the end of the movie is sad, but it wouldn't have been at all without the brilliant music by james horner. Cameron's script is quite empty and flat, actually. the movie soundtrack is more worth your money than the movie is. I give it a 6.9 out of 10",Titanic
1546,stonehorn,"Oh, my god... How is it possible to make this crap?",1,23 November 2004,"That's it; Titanic is (next to House of 1000 Corpses) officially the worst movie ever made.. How is it possible to make a movie about a ship sinking and focus so little on the actual sinking of the ship.. Jesus, the only important thing seems to be the relationship between the extremely gay Leonardo Di Caprio and the chubby Kate Winslet.. I mean; come on! There were other people there as well!!! They actually died and didn't get to tell their so-called ""moving story"" to others.. A bit of focus on that would be nice!Only women in the age 8-15 years old can seriously enjoy Titanic because of the rubbish acting, the unfathomably bad story and the ridiculously dull ending... However, I haven't actually seen Titanic, because I'd rather be forced to watch a brick wall for a good two hours instead, but these things I've said in this comment I can tell anyway.. And those of you who disagree with me only do because you're in love with Di Caprio... Fact.",Titanic
1547,nirmalsuki,I disagree with IMDb voters who think this is worth more than one star,1,21 December 2006,"I watched Titanic when they had a screening of it at our school. It was the worst experience of my life (not just the worst movie experience), and I live in a country with a war on and economic strife, and double digit inflation. I have sat through tough examinations, have undergone painful surgery and been robbed at gunpoint, but this is still my worst experience ever.(Ok, the gunpoint thing is a bit exaggerated. I was held at gunpoint, not robbed) I personally think that Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are two of the most talented actors of their generation, and I wish them all the very best of luck for the rest of their acting careers (they don't need it, they are good) The plot of this particular movie does not amount to more than pulp fiction (Not the 1994 movie, the genre of fiction). It could have been written by a starry eyed teen-aged girl with no real measure of what love really means. (I have nothing against teenagers. I have against this story) Any more comments would just make me a bit more tired.",Titanic
1548,lizzie-50,"Love it or hate it, it's a story that will stick with you for a long time.",5,31 July 2005,"Titanic is one of those films that you have to see. It's one of those films that can reduce almost anybody to tears, if not for one storyline then for the other.Unless you've had your head in the sand ever since this film was released then you'll know the two stories this film revolves around. The first is the obvious one, the true story of the 'unsinkable ship'. The tragic tale of an unimaginable catastrophe. The second is the fictional love story, the collision of lives that could only have happened aboard the ship. The love story starts off pretty simple, the classic example of a romantic film plot. Boy meets girl and they fall in love, love is forbidden but they fight for their love and this is normally where they'd all live happily ever after. Now that's where the first storyline confuses things because as well all know on this ship, most of the passengers didn't survive the journey.Like I said this is a film that can reduce almost anybody to tears. Whether the reason is the tragic reality of the disaster that was the Titanic or the love story that touched the world. Leonardo DiCaprio is perfect for the role of Jack Dawson, likewise Kate Winslet, Rose and Gloria Stuart tells the story beautifully as the future Rose.The film itself is very poorly made by today's standards, especially considering it cost more to make than the original ship did. The computer graphics are spectacularly bad, but all that seems insignificant.This film is a big deal and you can never fully join in film discussions until you've seen it. Love it or hate it, it's a story that will stick with you for a long time.The unfortunate thing is that now, think of the Titanic and you think of the tragic love story, you think of Jack and Rose. Nobody ever thinks of the tragedy that was the 'ship of dreams'.",Titanic
1549,Foot_Freakin_Master,Mediocre at Best,5,4 January 2005,"I was so excited at the prospect of seeing Titanic. I anxiously waited for the film to begin. By the end, I knew that I never wanted to see it again. What a disappointment.I suppose the special effects and set design were great. Perhaps some of the scenes were enjoyable. But the acting was only so so. The story was lame, the romance banal. The Billy Zane character was a true joke. Plus, so much of the movie lacked credibility. Wouldn't the character played by Kate surely have drowned before being able to be rescued? An overlong study in mediocrity at best. James Cameron gave us a dud.I admit some of my disdain is in response to the great marketing rush. I feel as though the movie was being jammed down my throat. Nevertheless I stand by my criticisms and have found many people who agree with me. Skip this and watch A Night to Remember.",Titanic
1550,misterchrissir,Very good.,10,12 June 2005,"I enjoyed this movie, and thought it was real good for the price of the movie ticket and DVD. A treasure hunter is looking for a diamond. He finds a drawing of a girl with the diamond. It is shown on the news, and an old lady calls up claiming to be the woman in the drawing. She is asked to come to the ship to help with the search. However, she tells her side of the story of what really happened. She was Rose, a young girl that felt trapped inside her own world because she is being forced to marry a rich guy. She meets a third class guy named Jack Dawson. They fall in love, while being separated by Rose's mother and Cal. (Sounds like a cow to me). While all the chaos happens, the ship hits the iceberg.

Yes the movie is long, yes is commercial, yes is an ""oscar movie"" and so what?? Is a movie done with a lot of spirit, with energy, a magnificent movie, Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were amazing and look where they are now, they are two of the best performers of our generation and all the supporting members of the cast (Kathy Bates, Frances Fisher, Billy Zane... ) are respected actors that have given the world great performances. James Cameron had the vision and knew exactly who was right for the roles and in that same way he did the hole movie. The songs, the score, the make up, everything is where it belongs, is a great movie that only future generation are going to appreciate the way it should be.

1552,whyohwhy1896,I still love it,10,18 January 2006,"I will always remember the first time I saw ""Titanic."" The year was 1998--late February, to be precise. I was ten years old, in the fifth grade, and had been hearing for weeks about how good this movie was and how it was like nothing anyone had ever seen. I was desperate to see it. However the forbidden fruit had been rated PG-13, so I was afraid I would never see it, being too young. Then, as luck would have it, one of my friends invited me to go see it for her birthday. I thought it would be the classic formulaic love story with some good, fun thrills. I was wrong.I had never had such a thrilling experience in a movie theater in my life! I was quite literally on the edge of my seat. Especially during the last half...there were many memorable scenes, including Rose searching for Jack below decks, the evil fiancé pulling out a shotgun, and of course, the sinking...""Titanic"" didn't end the way I expected it or wanted it to; I had imagined both of the lovers would be rescued and live happily ever after. At ten, I was deeply upset by the early death of Jack, but I understand today that it was necessary for him to die, otherwise the full extent of the tragedy couldn't be grasped. Someone I know said that this movie is the closest you can get to the real tragedy without experiencing it firsthand, and I'm inclined to agree. (Though I did visit a Titanic exhibit--from the actual ship--last summer and saw the shoes of Eino Panula, the ""unknown child of the Titanic,"" and it was bloody awful, to say the least.) Now I understand in some years it's become trendy to hate ""Titanic."" Perhaps it's because Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't seem as cute anymore. Perhaps the special effects seem old. Perhaps it was some of the (at times) rather weak dialog. Who knows? But I still like it, really like it in fact, and occasionally I pull out my old VHS copy and watch it. It still hasn't lost its power to move and disturb me.",Titanic

It uses the best special effects and technology of it's time and even though those aspects are outdated now, I still find myself drawn in. I'm drawn in after so many years because of the great talent of Kate Winslet and Leo Dicaprio and their great chemistry together. Those two, combined with the fantastic music, artistic direction, storyline, along with the technological aspects I've already mentioned creates an incomparable cinematic experience. I have never been so captivated by a single piece of media, before or since. I think it's the best...bottom line.",Titanic
1554,gberns,Kate Winslett's nude scene is the only reason to watch this.....,3,5 April 2005,"Mildly entertaining at best. At least a 6-pack is needed to enjoy this film. If you take a drink every time Leo DiCraprio screams ""Rose!"", you'll be drunk in no time. The only conceivable reason to watch this film a second time is to check out Kate Winslett's delightful headlights in full bloom. But she can be seen in all her birthday suit glory in Holy Smoke now, so it's really not necessary at all....Other then that, it's pure Hollywood Big Budget Rubbish. James Cameron is in the same class as Jerry Bruckheimer & Micheal Bay, who annually churn out the most redundant & unbelievably unbelievable crap which caters mostly to the masses of brain-dead followers who would eat a poop sandwich if they heard it was cool....",Titanic

As well as typecast him as a 'heart throb' for the past 8 years.This is the film that made over a billion dollars....and sent Director James Cameron into a self imposed underwater exile...mainly because after 'Aliens' and 'The Terminator' I'm sure all he was asked for by the Studios was 'Titanic II' for the past 8 years.This is the film that gave us the Celene Dion Song that makes us groan inwardly every time we hear it.And this is the film that has give us a whole new batch of clichés -- from the pair of lovers at the 'bow' of the ship to the love story over a necklace (lampooned perfectly on a episode of Futurama) -- this film hasn't stood the test of time, and frankly, never will.Is it entertaining? Maybe, if you can get past the sappy romance and the annoying acting.The 'true' story of Titanic -- characters like Kathy Bates as the 'unsinkable' Molly Brown -- aren't covered enough in this film, they are just there to frame a 'love' story between the irish boy in steerage and the high class girl he woo's with his talent. aw how sweet.No, this film was the embodiment of every 'chick flick' cliché wrapped up with a bow and a celene dion song, and sent to us the film audience.

1557,philmcardl,Elephantine disaster,1,1 July 2005,"What is it about James Cameron and women characters in his movies? I've come to the conclusion that they are really all men in skirts. Look at the female characters in Terminator or Aliens they are so butch and testosterone fuelled they aught to have beards and scratch their hairy testicles while chewing tobacco. I mean look what he did to our lovely English rose Kate Winslit in this ship wreck of a movie. He has this alleged Edwardian Lady stick her middle finger up at David Warner at one point and then slugs unconscious some burly crewman who was getting in her way. To top it all she has sex with a total stranger from steerage. Please!! With his tin ear for dialogue he should have stuck to doing thick ear action movies rather than this overly ripe disaster movie. There's an amateurish attempt to demonstrate the stupidity of Ruth's mother having her dismiss some sketches of Picasso (How did they get on board) with the words that he would never amount to anything. Subtle this is not. It looks far better than it sounds which is a great pity as some of the visuals are rather good. One unexpected laugh happened when Cameron picked up his Oscar he screams a line from the film ""I'm the king of the world"". Of course it fell completely flat on the assembled audience, who had never seen this dire movie or had forgotten the execrable script. The poor man must have thought his doggerel was memorable in some way, If this wasn't all bad enough we had to endure Celine Dion terrible song going ""on and on"".

I cannot stand Billy Zane's character. He is such a stereotypical rich guy, it makes me sick. No this is not a bad movie, but it is not great and did not deserve the academy award over LA Confidential, but that is not why I am giving it 6 out of 10. I think this movie lost a point just by making it seem like it was Rose/Jacks fault that the Titanic sunk, remember when the watch guards are not doing their job and watching Jack and Rose make out instead of looking for icebergs, they make it seem like they were partially responsible for it.

My favorite part is when Jack and Rose got together. I don't like the park when Jack is stuck handcuffed, but it adds suspense.I also think that it's funny when he goes to diner with Rose and her friends as he doesn't know what to do. The saddest part for me is when Jack dies at the end of it, I think that he and Rose would have made a really good couple-they could of got married.

1564,xxzerowildfirexx,The new Romeo and Juliet,9,2 February 2006,"Yeah, admitted, I love this movie. Which is nothing to be ashamed of; great movie, great directing, great set, great scale, great canvas, great story. Being a rookie filmmaker myself, I have many inspirations; but among my core favorites are Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Batman (Joel Schumacher aside), and Titanic. Its the quintessential love story, and I don't think there is any particular scene, or even a single shot, that lacks superb creative insight.Given that, I can't bring myself to name a scene that wasn't powerful. True each scene was more powerful than the one before it, but it didn't lessen the awe factor. Visual effects were done as they should be, done so well that its difficult to tell where the line is - digital/real.The score is phenomenal, James Horner provides a compelling score to finally go with a compelling movie. (I mean, lets face it, his work for Jumanji and Troy was good, but the movies lacked). For me, the musical score is one of the four key components to a good movie - good script, good acting, good directing, and good musical score. Thats just my personal analysis. True Celine Dion doesn't do the love theme justice, but the love theme is just the icing on the cake. the opening montages of the ship in all its grandeur made it truly feel like reality. Magnificent, beautiful, with some Irish humor! (admit it, you loved the Irish!!!) Whats not to like about this movie? It takes everything likable about Romeo and Juliet and gives it the backdrop of one of the greatest and most tragic moments in history. That, ladies and gentlemen, makes a timeless epic.",Titanic

One of Kate Winslets and Leonardo DiCaprios best by far. The ending made me cry a lot. They were both really good together. My favorite scene of the whole movie is after they go to the dinner and go to the party with the lower class people. LOVE IT!!! Their was some mess ups through the movie though. Like when DiCaprio passes Kate the note to come to the other party first it is yellow but when she opens it it is white. There is another when they are at the party and he asks her to dance and his hair is slicked back but when they are together and about to dance it is more down. It is and will ever be a classic.,Titanic
1566,rominaki1,"Although a representing piece of pure Hollywood cinema, a timeless epic...",10,24 February 2006,"I watched the movie in 1997 after it was released in VHS. I hadn't been able to watch it while being on the ""big screen"" and as a result my curiousness was explicitly bigger than it was at the beginning. I dare say I have watched it over 10 times ever since and still haven't got bored with it. Although it is a characteristic piece of pure Hollywood cinema, nobody can deny it's breathtaking and above-average moving. First of all, although the plot was simple, non-complicated and (shouldn't deny it)rather predictable, it still is a beautiful fictional love story which in fact has a logical base: we shouldn't forget that most marriages in the 1920s were a result of parents' personal ambitions and financial motivations, so they happened mainly for interest. But as soon as Rose met Jack, who above all saved her in every way a person can be saved, it is natural to fall in love at once, as near him she imagined the live she would have died to live. Then. as far as the technical merit is concerned....what can I say?The work made is just magnificent!!!No other comments. And finally it's worth mentioning the strongest element of the movie which rises her above all: the music, which is widely concerned as a classic!..... 9.8/10",Titanic

So let me just pop off the first few things that come to mind... 1)Hardly ""Best Picture"" caliber. As has already been noted, the dialog is ridiculous; the leads have no romantic chemistry; and - most shocking of all - the fx really aren't worthy of the hype. The sinking is impressively staged, but scenes of the Titanic underway don't seem much more credible than a lot of back-projected stuff coming out of Hollywood six decades ago. The computer-generated pans of the ship and the ocean are staggeringly obvious. 2)Billy Zane must give one of the most unbearable performances in film history. Granted, Cameron's script gives him nothing to work with; the viewer who noted he seems to be playing Satan has it just right. The scenes where he shoots (!) repeatedly at Jack on the Grand Staircase (wouldn't the list on the ship make it pretty damn hard to navigate the staircase by this point?) and uses a child to ensure his place on a lifeboat are just idiotic. I found myself grimacing every time I looked at Zane's sallow face and slanted eyes; this brand of villainy went out in pictures - I don't know - about the time of the real Titanic sank. 3)The leads are pretty hapless; and the fact they are able to spend so much time submerged in freezing water while unlocking doors, wielding axes, etc. beggars credibility. 4)A lot of the supporting roles are well-played. David Warner doesn't fall into the trap of over-acting like Zane does, and comes off quite well as the villainous valet. He seems to be having fun, which is pretty much all an actor can do in a flick like this. Gloria Stuart is extremely effective as Old Rose; she more-or-less singlehandedly endows the film with all its human pathos. I also enjoyed Bill Paxton's performance. He etched pretty effectively the character of a jaded adventurer. If only he had some decent dialog to work with. Victor Garber - a very fine actor - is wasted as Thomas Andrews. He is invariably excellent in all his scenes. 5)Folks who take umbrage to the fictional characters would do well to remember a similar framework was used with Clifton Webb and Barbra Stanwyck as an estranged fictional couple in Negulesco's 1953 Titanic. 6)WHERE WAS THE CALIFORNIAN? If you're looking for a movie villain, this ship fits the bill. The decision to cut scenes set on the derelict vessel is really regrettable. 7)On the whole, a decent, passable picture, with many striking images and a great last hour. But it pales in comparison with the 1958 ""A Night to Remember,"" which better captured the human drama of the ship's final moments. On the other hand, far better than the Stanwyck-Webb opus.",Titanic
1570,ScarJT,"One of the best films of 1997, and all time.",10,29 July 1998,"Many people complain about the problems regarding this film. A flimsy script, flat characters, over-hype, etc. . . But it's still a good film. In comparison to the cinematic garbage that is being churned out of Hollywood today, Titanic is a landmark production. The two making the film as excellent as it is are both James Cameron and James Horner. The scenes are well done, the music fitted excellently to them, and the acting is done finely. Titanic is a *good* movie.",Titanic
1571,Dutchy-15,I put Titanic in my Top 10 favourite movies of all time,10,18 April 1999,"This movie got a hold on me from start to finish. It's very rare for a movie to do that to me. From the opening scene with the beautiful music I was hooked. Everything looks so beautiful: the set decoration, the costumes, the boat itself, everything. The cinematography is brilliant. Pure eye candy. Cameron's Oscar for Best Directing is so well deserved. How he manages to show people falling and walking across the entire boat is amazing. There's this shot where the camera moves from the very head of the boat to the very back and literally everywhere something is happening. Brilliant piece of directing.The acting was good as well. Especially Kate Winslet en Billy Zane. The latter plays very convincing a real bastard. Very unpleasant person, but perfectly acted.Then the music. The soundtrack is one of the most wonderful ever made. The central theme of the woman humming is beautiful. Just like many other songs. Like for instance 'Nearer My God To Thee'. Very moving together with the accompaning scene.Of course people who've never experienced the sinking of a ship themselves, can't really image how that feels. But with this movie I had a feeling that we were able to experience from minute to minute what they must have went through. I thought the panic of the disaster was very realistically shown.The special effects. The sinking of the ship was the highlight of the movie. Seeing how the ship breaks, falls down again and people falling down when the ship stands straight up is truly breathtaking. Without a doubt one of the most impressive special effects I ever witnessed.Add that to what I said about the music, the set decoration, the cinematography, the directing, the realistic showing of the disaster and you get one of the best movies ever made. I put Titanic in my Top 10 favourite movies of all time.",Titanic
1572,mr.blond,Whats the big deal,1,14 August 1998,"I dont see why people are saw this film over, and over and over....again.  It added nothing new to the disaster genre (its just an overblown Poseidon Adventure), it is nowhere near as romantic as other epics, like Casablanca , Gone with the Wind or Dr.Zhivago.  To me, this was just another over-hyped romance, like ""The English Patient"".  And can someone tell me whats so romantic about a woman dumping her fiance, for some fly-by-night hustler, who can dance.  Maybe its my artifical heart talking, but thats not romantic.",Titanic
1573,wolters,What was all of the hype about?,2,20 September 1998,"I was one of the ""few"" who didn't see Titanic in the theaters. I am not sure why. I am a big fan of James Cameron movies. Having enjoyed Aliens, The Abyss and The Terminator movies, I really thought I would enjoy Titanic. First of all, I really admired the set design and the special effects. Those alone really made the movie for me. I felt the acting was sub-par compared to most Cameron movies and the dialogue was very dull at times. The sub plots didn't interest me at all. Also, why was the movie given a PG-13 rating? One of the sub plots was about nude drawings and showing someone nude while they are being drawn? Couldn't they have come up with something more family oriented than a nude drawing recovered? Call me old fashioned, but I can't understand why this movie made so much money and it contained nude scenes? I wanted to see a movie that dealt with the events leading up to the wreck and didn't expect those scenes plus pre-marital sex! I am not sure how much of the film was the truth and what was embellished? I know it seems like I am hung up on this, but it took me off guard. To continue, I felt that the sinking scenes were well done and it continues to show how much ""disaster"" realism that James Cameron likes to include in his movies. Make your own mind up, but I felt that Titanic could have been a little better than it was!",Titanic
1574,Hayley-2,*sigh*,5,11 December 1998,"I am just going to pretend that this didn't win the Oscar for best picture. And while we are in my fantasy world where people actually realise that spending the entire economy of a small country on a visual game of pretend is a terrible thing, lets also pretend that helen hunt wasn't even nominated. I feel better. The sheer anger I feel when I see the massive amounts of money squandered in an ode to capitalism (I'm sorry, mr. steinbeck. Some people just didnt get your grape-related novel) overrides any positive points to this movie... Acting? I would be more convincing as Jack (and I'm female....not that leo isnt) and dialogue? I'm laughing....actually I'm crying now. I would fomally like to apologise to the cast and crew of LA Confidential and explain to them that the judges had all too much fun glueing those envelopes together. (Helen Hunt???? How COULD they???) But like to remind them that they failed to nominate Pacino for the Godfather or award Brando for Streetcar (two of the most pivotal performances ever). Hopefully the recognition of these two colossal whoop-sies will ease the pain in that neither Guy Pearce nor Russel Crowe were nominated.I just hope people don't put this movie in the same 'masterpiece' bracket as Star Wars. Then I'll be really pi-...annoyed",Titanic
1575,wolfy-2,More Praise for Titanic,10,30 July 1998,"Yes I know people all over the world have praised Titanic since it was released, so i'm just going to add my own 2 cents worth !Of course the characters of Rose and Jack were two dimensional but thats the amazing thing about this film you just don't care about that at all! You are able to look past that and see the scope of the film and the tragedy surrounding this the sinking of the worlds greatest ship. By looking at it through the eyes of two fictional characters Cameron has achieved the virtually impossible giving us characters we can care about without alienating the fact that the tragedy is only moments away.Many people have seen it more than once myself included, and a lot of people ask why?, it's simple, yes you know whats going to happen and when it's going to happen but you are able to look well past that and marvel in the awesome film skills of James Cameron and his crew, but it's not just that by a long way, the more you see it the more you seem to appreciate the whole saga of human tragedy that was apparent throughout the whole film! James Cameron has achieved what most people thought that he could not, a movie with fantastic special fx that did not sacrifice the scope of the tragedy.My personal rating *****",Titanic
1576,snakens,another great piece of art,10,17 March 1999,"I find it interesting that so many people take the time to trash this movie. They can't understand why so many people have taken this film to heart. Well, it is after all, just another piece of artistic work.  And like all such endeavors--beauty is in the eyes of the beholder!  Not everyone thinks the Mona Lisa, or the Eiffel Tower,  or even the Viet Nam Memorial Wall are worthy of praise.I've seen ""Titanic"" many, many times.  And in my opinion, it will stand the test of time as one the greatest films of ever made.  I realize not everyone agrees,  and I wouldn't expect that,  but please don't infer that I'm stupid for loving this movie.",Titanic
1577,snakens,an almost perfect movie,10,26 August 1998,"yes, Titanic is almost a perfect movie.  It has made a big impact in my life at a particularly difficult time.  I want to thank Jim, Leo, Kate, and the entire cast and crew for bringing me the hours of enjoyment this film has brought me.",Titanic
1578,snakens,Myths and complaints about the movie,10,5 August 1999,"As a big fan of the movie I'd like to clear up some misconceptions.  First of all, as someone who has seen this film many times at the theaters, the notion that teenage girls were responsible for making Titanic the huge success it was because of their obsession with Leonardo is completely wrong. In fact, they were probably in the minority in the audience.  What I saw was an older group of people coming to see this movie--probably at the urging of one of their grown children. In addition, I witnessed substantial representation of our city's  oriental community at most the showings. Obviously, this movie transcended age and ethic barriers; that's what made it the success it was! Was the dialog corny in some places?  Of course it was, just like in real life romances! Could they have developed the characters more?  Yes, but the movie is already over 3 hrs long, how much development do you want? Finally, this movie was very costly to make, and some say it was a waste of resources.  Well, the proof is in the pudding as they say--it'll remain the top grossing film for many, many years.",Titanic
1579,Flounder-12,The rise of mediocrity,1,13 August 1998,"One word to describe how I feel about this movie: AAAAAAUUUUUUGGGGHHHHH!!!!  I apologize for being so verbose.Let's not confuse the difference between ""good"" movies and ""entertaining"" movies.  I'll admit that when I went to see this movie, for that last hour when ship sank, I was ""entertained.""  I'm also entertained by that paddle with the ball on a rubber band, but that doesn't mean I think it's worth over a billion dollars or eleven ""Pointless Toy Awards.""  In addition, I wouldn't play with it for three hours, or even go back and play with it again four or five times.  ""Titanic"" isn't a ""good"" movie.  As far as the Academy Awards is concerned, I'm sure there are many, many little people who deserved recognition for working hard on this film, and they no doubt received that recognition.  I don't have a problem with that.  As for that arrogant pig of a man, James Cameron, there were at least two other directors far more deserving of an Oscar.  In fact, there were at least two other movies deserving of ""Best Picture.""  Here's a little suggestion for September when ""Titanic"" is released on video : save your money.  The ship still sinks, and I know that my heart will go on aching because we're rewarding a mediocre film for being exceptionally mediocre.  Use your money to see some of the good movies you missed when you went back to ""Titanic"" for the fifth time.",Titanic
1580,Flounder-12,"Okay, enough...",1,18 September 1998,"Let's sink this ship right now.  It's over, baby, there's nothing left! This is a BAD movie.  I'm not saying there's any harm in enjoying a bad movie, but some of you people have taken it too far.  Epic?  Greatest movie of all time?  Deserving of 11 Oscars?  I SPIT on the ground all of you people who have seen it five, six, seven times walk on.  Bad script + ridiculous acting + egotistical chucklehead director = PIECE OF FILTH MOVIE. I love watching piece of filth movies as much as the next guy, but all of you people with your Leo posters and your Titanic t-shirts and your Greatest Movie of All Time attitudes have driven me and others with even half a bit of common sense to HATE and LOATHE this ""movie.""  I no longer hold this little travesty in any higher regard than I hold ""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers,"" no offense to the ""Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers"" people.",Titanic
1581,BGutting,Vapid waste of celluloid and $250 million.,1,19 August 1998,"After watching Titanic, I'd be willing to bet that most of you could take $250 million and make a better picture.  James Cameron is a talentless director who made Titanic only as a pathetic ploy to garner attention and win an Oscar.  His immaturity shows not only by his vicious insults towards Kate Winslet, who's a terrible actress anyway, but also in his sub-literate script.  The movie sort of works like a coloring book, except that it wasn't that inventive -- I found it more like a color-by -number foray into film making.  This rancid piece of garbage plays out like a low-rent made for TV movie.Titanic represents the triumph of money and bad writing, something that everyone in Hollywood should abhore.  Oh, and it won 11 Oscars for ONE reason: it was made by two of the larget studios in Hollywood and all the employees voted out of loyalty.  I've never seen anything so formulaic in my life.If you want a quality picture from the modern day, watch L.A. Confidential. If you want something that will touch you emotionally, watch Saving Private Ryan.",Titanic
1582,pschorsc,Went for the effects and fell in love,10,20 September 1998,"I was one of the hold outs that only saw this on video.  Decided to buy the widescreen even though it wasn't a director's cut.  I loved it.  The first time I saw it I was stunned by the portrayal of all those people dying.  The love story left me a little cold.  The second time I started getting over Leo looking 16 (forget Leo - what about Jonathan Phillips -- 2nd officer Lightoller?) and Kate looking 22 and started watching the love story.  It is a beautiful love story/triangle.  I was touched by the scene where Rose could have ""opened her heart"" but chose the path to stay closed.  (A portrayal of a critical juncture in many relationships.)After I read a lot on the Titanic I realized that many of the situations and lines (probably that others say are cheesy) are exact quotes or similar situations that happened on the real Titanic - albeit to other people.  Such as a steward telling someone who broke a door that he would have to pay for that. And many, many others.  I was also impressed on how accurate Cameron portrayed what we know about the shipwreck.  Although I  am disappointed on a few glaring errors - i.e. Murdock closing the watertight doors after the ship struck instead of before, Andrews being aware of the ship hitting something.  Or don't agree with a few of the portrayals - Bruce Ismay was too evil and there is a lot of dispute on which, if any, officer shot himself.Overall, this film has been one of the best I have seen.  A joy to watch and one I will probably watch over and over.  I hope a director's cut is released with more of ""A Night to Remember"" details.  Cameron is one of my favorite directors - Aliens, The Abyss, Terminator and he didn't let me down here.Although, I tried to talk my father into seeing it and he said, ""why would I want to see a bunch of people drown?""  I should have said, ""they don't drown, mostly they freeze to death.""  But that probably wouldn't have swayed him.",Titanic
1583,SonofMan,"Lack of historical accuracy, etc.",6,16 October 1998,"After watching Titanic ONCE, many things went through my mind.  People see this as a masterpiece while I see this movie as another above-average movie. I felt like going to the restroom after staying in my seat for more than three and a half hours (counting trailers). One glaring aspect I personally do not like is Cameron's portrayal of the third class passengers being locked in their area.  This did not really happen in the true story of the Titanic.  Many famous people died on the ship and Cameron does not refer to this.  Instead, he plays on people's emotions to make them feel sorry for the third class passengers' misfortunes. Another setback I saw in the movie was DiCaprio's less than average acting performance.  He was not nominated for Best Actor for a reason and Kate Winslet was a poor match to put with him.  She looked a lot older than DiCaprio and her better acting ability made DiCaprio's acting look even more disparaging. Even with the movie hoopla, the teenage girl infatuations of DiCaprio, and the great box-office records it broke, Titanic is not one of the best movies of all time, but good enough for a night with a loved one.",Titanic
1584,jerome_w,What hell must be like,1,28 September 1998,"My job requires me to travel every week to some other part of the country and I usually come home on the weekends. This summer I traveled from Washington to California every week. So twice a week I was on a 5 hour flight. I will not mention the airline, but they decided to capitalize on Titanic's popularity and show it as many times as they could. Well, guess what. I ended up having to sit through Titanic a total of 6 times!!! This must be what hell is like. I had to sit through a movie 6 times more than I wanted to see it. I saw it at the movies (friends payed for the ticket because I wouldn't see it otherwise) and I thought to myself what a crappy movie. But after being subjected to a whole month of Cameron and Leo I hate this movie more than anything else in existence. You see, the flights I'm on either have One big screen for the whole cabin or strategicaly placed monitors. So even if you don't ""RENT"" the headset you still have to be subjected to the visual ""majesty"" of Titanic. Those of you who don't like this movie don't need me to tell you what's wrong with it, and those who love it probably won't get past a review that doesn't start with ""THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM EVER!!"" So I just wanted to share my experience and offer to you this little question.What if you were trapped in a room where where your eyes were taped open and you had to ""experience"" Titanic over and over and over and over and over....",Titanic
1585,ben-68,What a terrible Film,1,21 October 1998,"Not only was the plot dodgy at best, but the actors was wooden, the effects shoody to say they cost millions, and the background looked like it was painted on. How on earth would Kate Winslet's character ever have fallen for that excuse for an actor DiCaprio",Titanic
1586,Slademan,"Mindless tripe, garbage",1,17 October 1998,"This film is an insult to the intelligence of the common garden slug. The romance between DiCaprio and Winslet is completely unbelievable, with no real chemistry between the two. The script is complete garbage, crafted solely in the believe that the public is as idiotic as the creator of this film. Though the sinking of the ship is well crafted and visually stunning, there is no pity to be felt for the cardboard characters that inhabit this film. The 3 hours or so spent watching this horrible film could be more constructively used watching paint dry. The plot is slipshod and centered not on the tremendous agony and suffering of those soul's lost on the Titanic, but on the self-centered interests of a girl leaving behind her obligation to her family for a 3-day fling with an artist, which is consumated in the back of a car. My hope is that this film is somehow exposed to the people as the massive dung heap that it is. I suggest people who liked this inane, insulting piece of garbage view a film of real emotional power that was also crafted from historical events from the 1910's, ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. I also recommend those who liked this film view the reviews it got from Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times, who exposes the film's huge weak spots and lack of heart.",Titanic
1587,Slademan,"Wow, I found this film highly unenjoyable",1,29 November 1998,"I held off on viewing Titanic until it was let out on tape. I had heard horror stories from friends and colleagues. They spoke of oceans of tearfilled faces and groups of 12 year old girls singing along with that god-awful Celine Dion song. So I dodged the theaters until a friend bought the tape. Out of morbid curiosity to see this ""epic"" film, I borrowed the tape, and sat down to watch it with her. My lord, it was the LONGEST freakin' piece of schlock I have ever seen. As my friend began to sob after the death of Leonardo, I got about as emotional as I do when I watch those AT&T long-distance commercials. You know, the ones where a little boy in L.A. talks to his daddy who is on a business trip in New York. And the boy always tells his father, ""I love you, daddy."", then the music cues to pictures of the teary-eyed father. Well, I saw a parallel between the commerical and movie Titanic. Both are contrived, blatantly staged, and chocked full of cardboard characters. The film was a filthy attempt to contort and force the emotions of the lowest common denominator. An striking example of this film's attempt to grab people and literally wrench the tears out of them come with the scene where the frozen, dead mother cradles her frozen child in her arms. Had this scene been in any fillm where the emotions were not completely artificial, I would have cried. But the fact is that this film was devoid of any real, heart-felt emotion. So when I saw this scene, I felt nauseous and grew full of spite. I now loathe Cameron for his utterly plastic,  inhumane protrayal of the Titanic disaster. Yet it appears he tapped a class of people bountiful enough to garner Titanic in excess of 600 million dollars in the states alone. I never knew America was so replete with people of such bad taste, people who would not only like, but view repeatedly this sad excuse for cinema. I weeped after seeing Titanic, but not do to its shoddy screenplay or horrifically unrealistic acting and emotions. I weeped for America, and the death of American filmmaking. I weeped knowing that such a film could garner accolades and billions of dollars, and that this bounty would push studios to make bigger films with smaller characters, crappy scripts and pretty faces devoid of ability that would pack seats no matter the quality of the film. (Here comes the TITANIC melodrama.) I could see a future where Coppola, Kubrick, and Malick stood on the gallows, pleading to the masses, now anesthetised and made prostrate by Springer and the numerous Titanic sequels. The directors voiced there thoughts on the death of intellect in America, then the masses let them hang as they chanted ""Jerry! Jerry! Jerry!""Cue ""My Heart Will Go On"" and the sobbing girls.",Titanic
1588,Froggie-4,An alright movie spoiled by rampant unoriginality,2,21 October 1998,"I saw this film at a friend's house, expecting a nice flick. But I was wrong. Titanic, in my opinion, didn't deserve all the acclaim it's been given. It would have made an okay movie, but the cliche's were heavy enough to sink the ship even if it hadn't hit the iceberg. Chances are, the reason this film was so successful is because it crudely slams together all the various concepts that other successful films have used. They include #1: Romance between rich and poor, #2: Stuffy rich folk, happy, free poor folk. #3: An adventurer, world-travelling lead male character. #4: A husband-to-be for the main male character's romance, with a tendency to be abusive. #5: A historical setting. #6: The romance genre done very sappily. #7: Attempts at making the audience cry by showing scenes of various tragedy in case the sappy romance plot fails to make one cry, so that people will call it touching. The list goes on and on, but unlike so many others, I'm afraid I'll have to chuck this entire film and all it's content in the ""It's been done."" area. If you LIKE seeing concepts all mashed together with little subtlety, however, this film's your ticket to enjoyment. A foul movie.",Titanic
1589,geiiga42,Why?,1,1 June 1999,"Perhaps this was a good movie, as so many seem to think. I would tend to disagree. James Cameron, for whatever good qualities he may have, is not an Oscar-caliber director. The script was shoddy (Proper girl runs away from her betrothed and gets dirty with a street urchin. Street urchin is properly glorified and the betrothed vilified), and the acting was subpar (the only character I actually liked was the ship's designer). That leaves this movie with what every other James Cameron flick has: special effects. Unfortunately, they're not great enough to redeem the three hours plus this movie takes to endure.  I was looking at my watch more than the screen when I first saw it, and I'd point anyone who wants to see this movie to films that deserved an Oscar but didn't receive one due to the Academy's buying the hype.",Titanic
1590,antbabe,The worst movie ever,1,13 November 1998,I can't believe that people actually enjoyed this movie. It is a terrible movie with horrible actors and a horrific script. It feels like a 3rd rate tv-movie. I went to see this with some of my friends and about 5 of us cried and the rest of us were laughing hysterically at stupidity of the dialogue. I would only see it again if you paid me all of its profits.,Titanic
1591,Celes,Not as wonderful as everyone thinks...,4,9 November 1998,"The first time I saw Titanic I was swept away (no pun intended) by the emotion of it.  I cried many tears.  I claimed it was one of the best movies I'd seen.  Then I saw it a second time.  Let me set the scene:  About 5 months after I saw Titanic the first time I'm in an airplane on a 5 hour flight.  Bing! the intercom goes on annoucing that the inflight movie will be Titanic and that our captain is Bob!  ""Titanic"" I think, ""that was a really good movie"".  So I buy a pair of headphones and settle down ready to watch a really good movie and get even more out of it that I had the first time.   I'm watching and I start doing something I didn't do the first time... I actually listened to the dialouge and paid attention to the acting.  What a disappointment!  This was just a stupid movie that had  some really sad parts towards the end.  The acting is so phony, and anyone that actually thinks that the ""I feel like I'm flying"" scene was the least bit well written or acted should be taken out and shot. First of all you're telling me that even though this ship is in the middle of the North Atlantic where there are icebergs that somehow Jack and Rose could wear little shortsleeved outfits, Come on.  Secondly you aren't allowed at the front of the boat, you are in big trouble if you are caught.  I could do this for every scene.Look I'm a TEENAGER and a girl I think this. So don't think that I'm some old guy.  If you need a tearjerker watch ""Terms of Endearment"" instead it has better acting and dialouge. ""Titanic"" gets a 5 out of 10.",Titanic
1592,Idaho-2,"The movie is like the boat, they both sink",3,10 November 1998,"First let's talk about the actors. Kate and the old woman were in nomination for an Oscar. I don't think Kate is a bad actress, she's ok, but her acting in this movie is not at the level of an Oscar. Maybe I'm wrong ( for the Titanic's fans ) but the actors of the movie don't seem to feel theirs roles. Acting is at the level of a B-series movie.F-X The specials effect are more at the level of a 60 millions budget movies than a 200 millions movie class. When the camera is away from the boat, computered people looks more like a matches man than real people. When I look at Starwars New Edition, Georges Lucas have make a really good job. I have to give one point to James Cameron, I like when some dude fall down and hurt the propeller of the Titanic.Human Tragedies Many have said that Titanic is one of the greatest disasters ever. It is true but the way it is shown looks more like a joke than reality. If you wanna see a movie of this kind, see Saving Private Ryan or even Deep Impact. We are not talking about 2000 deads but millions.The best point of Titanic is costumes, they are really nice.",Titanic

A love story between a rich girl and a poor boy - seen it a thousand times, and it always had a happy end. Not so in Cameron's film! The Titanic hits the iceberg - it could have been like watching a 50's sci-fi today. Again Cameron's Digital Domain (with Hollywoods most famous special-effects-factories on their side) created one of the most spectacular movies ever. Some movies get all these things right but still do a very messy job - eg. use plates with a ""made in Hong Kong"" sign on them. However, Cameron paid attention to the details. All in all, the actors were really good (and not only Leo and Kate, but Billy Zane and Co. as well!) and the breathtaking cinematography and music combined with Cameron's monumental style (T2, True Lies, The Abyss) gave a wonderful mix.",Titanic

But this is really cinema at its best.I can't believe that there are people who disliked this movie. How can one ignore the magic in this story?

This movie is just another computer generated image with people, who aren't even very good actors, stuck in to give it life. It's no different than Cameron's ""T2"".

I could have taken a nap during any part of it and when I woke up, I still would have understood what was going on. And Leo really didn't give that great of performance.

During the time when the characters could have been developed, (pre-iceburg), they weren't.  I didn't like/dislike any of the characters to care if they sunk or not.  The young romance just seemed ""young"" without much chemistry between the two.  Sticking up the middle finger (sophisticated humor there) was ridiculous.  They didn't do that back then.  It was just thrown in for the guarantee of a laugh from the immature.  The movie seemed contrived.  It would have been better off as some sort of documentary, minus the lame storyline.",Titanic

But, believe me, the two friends I went with were bawling their eyes off.  I have to admit I had to swallow my throat a number of times.  This movie is moving and it takes you there.  Literally. Exactly what movies are supposed to do, create an escape from reality. Cameron has done an excellent job, and the acting was IMHO great too.

The only part of the movie I could really get into was the actually sinking of the ship, but even that is not good enough to make me want to see the movie (or any part of it) again.  I think this is a perfect example of how hype can sell.  Everyone was so amazed at the little touches and details and special effects that they never stopped to realize they were wasting nearly 3 hours of their lives for a 1 to 1 1/2 hours of special effects.  I have argued this point with people who swear it is one of the best films, and all I have to do to shut them up is ask one question; ""will you ever watch it again?""  The answer is always ""no.""",Titanic

1609,BJW-2,Sinking feelings,6,16 June 1999,"This unconvincing love-story wrapped around a human disaster made a fairly average Hollywood Blockbuster.  The characters were 1 dimensional stereotypes and utterly unrealistic, perhaps best summarised by the moment in which Billy Zane crumbles beneath the weight of traditional Hollywood narrative conventions and pulls a gun on the young lovers.  Did people really believe that?  The action is average, the acting okay, the drama tedious, the special effects a dime a dozen these days, and the ending PREDICTABLE.  Steven Spielberg would have done it so much better.  Come on, face up to the HYPE!",Titanic
1610,A Caggs,Definitely Overrated,4,17 April 2001,"Let me start by saying that this is a good film, and I enjoyed it the first time I saw it, in the theater.  Whew! Okay, with that out of the way, let me just say that this is quite possibly the MOST overrated flick in history of film!  It's good, and that's it!  It's not great, it's definitely not re-watchable, and most importantly, it is NO best picture!  I don't mean to sound angry, but if you can honestly say that this film is better than either ""Good Will Hunting"" or ""As Good as it Gets"" then you'd be the first I've come across.  The only thing that saves this movie is that the horribly predictable and cliche story line doesn't get in the way of the barely-above-average special effects.  And boy does it drag on!  When I saw it the second time, I kept looking at my watch, thinking that the flim was really dragging, and then it occurred to me -- the Titanic hasn't even begun sinking yet!!  It's such a huge relief when the film ends that it's hard to be moved or amazed by it. 
Leonardo di Caprio could not have played his role more flatly if he tried. Kate Winslet barely pulls her part off as well; and her perfomance reminded me more of a soap opera rather than a best picture.I have no idea how this movie made so much money at the box office. If you didn't catch it in the theater, then don't even bother renting it.  Whatever little charm it has is entirely lost on a small screen. Maybe if you rented it, and muted the sound, you could enjoy a few parts of it at least.And to conclude, I just want to say how dirty it was for the films' creators to sneak in Bill Paxton.  Bill Paxton is notorious for sneaking himself into film roles, and promptly ruining the movie.  You'll never see his name or his part in any of the commercials or trailers, but sure enough, WHAM, suddenly he appears, all fired up to ruin the movie.  Lucky for him, Titanic was already ""sunk"" before he had the chance to put another hole in the ship. Nice work, Bill.All in all, it's an okay film that's easily forgettable because something better comes along all the time.  I feel for the producers / directors / writers of ""As Good as it Gets"" because they were robbed by this movie. 
I bet you can't sit through it twice!",Titanic

The real star is the ship, but Kate Winslet and Billy Zane give great performances. Many of the smaller roles are excellent, particularly crew members. The Irish band are brilliant,the costumes are gorgeous and the attention to detail is top class. Leonardo di Caprio makes a good fist of his role but really any half way competent actor could have done the job. Overall though,the only main reservation is the script!",Titanic

1613,Bobdav,Good family entertainment.,9,12 October 1999,"What do Titanic and 'Independence Day' have in common? They have both been roundly derided for their technical/acting/story line when both films can stand alone for sheer entertainment. What is it about this film that makes three hours in a cinema pass so quickly? It's not the suspense of not knowing what will happen next, after all history tells us in graphic detail the fate of Titanic. Neither is it What happens to Rose, I mean the mere fact that Rose tells the story as a hundred and one year old woman tells us that she survives. So what is it about this film that makes it so enjoyable? Well it's five things really: (1) The romance between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio). (2) Does Jack survive? (3) The gradual realisation of the fate of Titanic and how it takes place (told with historical accuracy). (4) The remarkably accurate detail of the ships whole interior. (5) the special effects used during the sinking. All in all forget about the films supposed lack of technical excellence, poor storyline and trite dialogue and concentrate instead on the splendid entertainment on offer thanks to James Cameron's splendid direction, the superb cinematography and the excellence of the two leads.",Titanic

Nevertheless, I always thought about it as a typical love story as we have seen it a hundred times with the difference of the ...Titanic.Special Effects were good, the sinking was very well done. Even the more than three hours didn't bother me a lot. A few months later, I watched it again, this time on video. Since I'm not a di Caprio fan, I concentrated on the plot of on him. It was bad. This second time the movie bored the hell out of me. It is one of those movies you can get a complete awersion to. The plot is bad, dialogues are even worse and visual efects didn't look all too impresive either, just compare it with other, cheaper, movies.All in all after seeing the movie the first time I would have given it a rating of 9, now it gets a 1 (only because I can't rate below zero).",Titanic

Billy Zane HOW COULD YOU!",Titanic
1616,erich_hugo,Truly disappointing,1,9 January 2003,"I am disgusted with this movie. Firstly I admit that the special effects are extra ordinary but what would you expect of James Cameron. Terminator and Aliens speak for themselves and when it comes to movie making Mr. Cameron certainly ranks in the top 10 of current film directors. Thus, being based on historical events the special effects cannot save this movie because how more earth shattering can a sinking ship be than.. well a sinking ship. What really made my mouth bitter was the vacuous script. I got the idea that Mr. Cameron enlisted the help of all the daytime TV-soap writers to write the most vapid script ever. It would have been appropriate if the movie was released with Written boards which states: At 30 minutes cry et al.  The thing is, this is a JUST ADD WATER SCRIPT. (Literally) It is so innocuous that one can place it on any setting (even Sabrina the teenage witch) Unfortunately I disagree with the fact that this movie had 'broad appeal' If you take into account the general sample of viewers on this board have seen the movie in excess of 5 times in the cinema, it whittles down the number of actual viewers considerably. Furthermore, with the current crop of cinematic wonders being released it is obvious that Directors do not need to under-estimate their audience as they are more intelligent than they get credit for (case in point the name change of Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone to Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's stone so that American audiences would know what it is about.) Instead of dumbing down audiences, directors should inspire audiences to understand the world better.  I truly believe that Titanic will over the next 5 years be push down the list of greatest movies to the bottom 50 as the E-Generation likes more mental challenges (WRITTEN SIGN: CLAP HERE)",Titanic

1621,nicolemickolick,Fantastic,10,8 June 2000,"Titanic is an extremely well acted, well written movie.  All of the characters are so believable that you might think that the love story of Rose and Jack actually happened on the Titanic.  James Cameron's depiction of the Titanic sinking was thoroughly researched so that he could come as close as possible to recreating the actual event.  Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio played the parts of Rose and Jack beautifully.  Kathy Bates was extraordinary as Molly Brown.All of the detail that was taken to recreate Titanic is amazing.  The spiral staircase was perfectly detailed.  The actors were in authentic 1912 costume.  The cutlery was stamped with the White Star Line logo.  The carpets were even woven by the same company that wove the carpets for the actual Titanic.The scenes of the sinking were superior to any of the other movies about the Titanic.  There was more emphasis on what all of the people actually went through to try to save themselves and their families.Titanic is a wonderful movie and I would recommend it to anyone.",Titanic
1622,Timbo-34,Waste of time (A lot of time),1,14 June 2000,"I don't see what all the hype is about this movie.

It takes 3 and a half hours to tell that story? Come on, get serious.  I've got better things to do.  Like rinse out my eyes with paint thinner.Ever wonder why Titanic made so much money?  Four words... Thirteen Year Old Girls.  That's all.  Who else is shallow enough to see this movie more than once?  My little sister, in fact, saw it eight times... EIGHT!  That's almost 26 hours wasted, watching that pansy DiCaprio whine about love.Do you realize that at $10.00 a ticket, 183,530,000 tickets were sold. Each ticket wasting 3.25 hours of the viewers lives, 596,472,500 hours have been wasted on this show, and that if each person lived an average of 70 years, 69,811 years, or 997 lives have been wasted watching the Titanic.

1623,CSM101,One of the greatest movies of all time.,10,7 August 2000,"James Camerons' masterpiece ""Titanic"" is without a doubt one of the greatest movies of all time. It is the ultimate human story. Action, suspense, romance, drama and historical accuracy.The characters of Jack and Rose break the social boundaries to be with one another creating an emotional love story. By appreciating these two characters, feeling their passion, love, and desire they create a gateway for the audience to feel what it was really like to be on the Titanic. The presence of historical characters such as Captain Smith, Mr Ismay, and Thomas Andrews produce a greater sense of realism and allow us  appreciate the true tragedy of what happened to the luxury liner.The film had incredible music creating a sense of awe and respect for the great ship and all of its doomed passengers. The sound and ground-breaking special effects brought the ship back to life. We see the contrast between the huge pistons, the hundreds of stokers below, and the guts of of the ship with the beautiful, majestic swooping shots of the ship out at sea so we appreciate it on a much higher level.The action was brilliant. As the ship keeps going down the action gets more intense and more lethal. Obstacles keep coming up, harder and more difficult keeping us intensely involved. The passengers get desperate, trapped on what was once a beautiful ship, but now a crippled mass of metal pulling them into the freezing ocean.The sinking of the Titanic was a great tragedy. This Film represents it truthfully and emotionally. It is a classic and should never be forgotten.",Titanic

I still can´t believe with what an unbelievable expenditure he let the Titanic sink, and in all this there´s always  the love Story with Jack and Rose, simply fantastic.

1641,jmzkeenan,"Looks great, horribly clichéd plot",5,19 March 2009,"It's interesting to see the extreme opinions (pro or con) expressed here about Titanic, ranging from those who feel it's the greatest story ever told to those who feel it's the worst travesty ever produced in Hollywood. I don't agree with either – I feel that Titanic is a somewhat run-of-the-mill movie that wasn't worthy of the vast amount of hype it generated, but can still provide an evenings entertainment (albeit with some employment of the fast forward button). I can supplement my review with contemporary impressions from first seeing the movie in 1998, taken from an email cum movie review written to a friend of mine in a distant corner of the world who hadn't seen the movie yet. (Extracts from this email are in quotes).First, the good stuff. I loved the efforts that Cameron made (either through sets, or through CGI) to reproduce the look of the RMS Titanic, as well as re-enacting the sinking:""Verdict on Titanic: The staging of the ships interiors and exteriors are stunningly realistic -- damn near perfect is more like it. Obviously, a great deal of effort was made to get things down pat."" It was also very interesting to see the underwater film that Cameron really shot on the wreck of the Titanic – much better than the film shot for the Imax documentary Titanica. This underwater film, the interiors, and the digital depictions of the Titanic underway are enough to make the film worth watching all by itself.Regrettably, with the good comes the bad. I've always felt that the biggest strike against the movie is the cliché love story between the two star-crossed lovers:""Unfortunately, a good chunk of the film is the so-called 'love story'. This portion of the story, starring this year's pretty boy, is Hollywood cliché from start to finish. 'Poor little rich girl' meets poor but honest travelers/artist aboard the Titanic. She's travelling in 1st class with her beastly fiancée and assorted evil, stuck up, snobbish, rich capitalist/oligarch pigs. He's travelling 3rd class with the salt of the earth immigrants. Think for a few minutes and write up a list of 10 Hollywood clichés that come to mind. I guarantee that 75% of them are in the film.The real story of the Titanic and its passengers is story enough, in my opinion -- the love story wasn't needed. I assume that it was added to add some uncertainty to the story. Hollywood should have learned from Apollo 13 that just because the audience knows the end of the story doesn't mean you can't make a good movie of it. In any case, the 'love story' adheres so much to cliché that it can be mapped out with uncanny accuracy after ~ five minutes anyway.""The only thing I would retract from my 1998 email is the comment about DiCaprio being ""this year's pretty boy"" – I've subsequently seen some of his other work, and I think that he can be a decent actor. I actually own Titanic on DVD (purchased cheap), and I watch it occasionally. But I do so with ample use of the fast forward button. I've sometimes wondered what someone could do with a ""Phantom Edit"" of Titanic – could they edit Jack and Rose out of the film almost entirely, and just leave a decent semi-documentary account of the sinking?",Titanic

Kate Winslet plays a spoiled ""free-spirit"" who is being forced by her mother to marry the wealthy Billy Zane. On board the Titanic, she meets Jack (Leonardo di Caprio), who teaches her to be ""free"", or in other words, be trashy and self-centered. The movie is filled with bad acting and even worse writing.

Fortunately one grows old and starts to appreciate movies in another dimension (It's not that I like ""Gone With The Wind"", I think it's quite ridiculous, nevertheless a masterpiece in its own right and time).When my first seeing of TITANIC was over, I thought to myself: ""Well, well, my generation has a ""classic"". And what a classic! Excellent."" I was absolutely overwhelmed. We all knew the story, so the finale would not be the highlight. You might say it's quite simple, but why complicate love? If I were Jack, I would also fall in love with Rose, like I felt in love with Kate Winslet! But what, you may ask, makes the movie so good? Watch it and enjoy it as a whole!!

But titanic started and by that time I thought all the hype was going to be worth it.Instead, i was treated to 194 minutes of clichéd romance and crappy songs by equally crappy recording ""artists"". All 194 minutes of this to boil down to what we all knew was going to happen. THE SHIP SANK.So by now I've left the cinema picturing James Cameron rolling around in pools of money and laughing as he watches us on a 13 meter television set from inside a hollowed out volcano.The only good thing about this movie was watching Leonardo Decaprico drown in icy cold water (because they couldn't possibly share a huge chunk of wood).

1652,beckster_1979,An extremely enjoyable feast for the eyes!,9,10 January 2002,"It's been a few years since I first saw Titanic, yet for me it has lost none of it's charm. Setting a love story against the back-drop of the doomed liner was bound to be a world-wide success, in fact the film is probably more well known than the ship was! Unfortunately, the film does lose something when it is not on a big screen as a TV screen (in my opinion) does not to justice to the sets, which are exquisite and match the luxury of the actual ship. Although I found the love story a little disappointing, it works remarkably well and keeps you guessing until the end what's going to happen to Jack and Rose, and the fact that they run practically through the entire ship as she's sinking give the special effects ample time to shine! For me, the film steps up a gear after the Titanic hits the iceberg, and you as the audience become enthralled in watching the chaos that ensues. (May I point out at this point that Officer Murdoch did not shoot anyone or himself, in fact what actually happened to him still remains a mystery). If you haven't seen this film yet, then crawl out from the rock you've been hiding under for the past 4 years and see it. It's great!

James Cameron deserves every penny he made from this film and the film deserves every Oscar it won. LA Confidential can't hold a candle to Titanic.

1656,swisstoni63,Bilge.,1,30 March 2002,I decided recently to give this one a viewing (against my better judgment). I thought that reducing one of the greatest maritime tragedies in history to an ill-conceived love story was in poor taste. Previous reviews have said it all really. For a more realistic and emotionally involving film about the Titanic see 'A Night to Remember'. Why do film-makers feel the need to 'spice up' events of such magnitude with improbable plots?? Appalling stuff. 1/10.,Titanic
1657,das_r,Why I like this movie so much,10,27 December 2007,"I've seen this movie plenty of times about the time it was released. Well, a few years later, about 1999, but it's not so important. The point is, I was about 10 or 11 years at this time. But now, in the German Christmas TV programme, I saw this movie again. Only partly, but I was amazed of it. I became aware of things I didn't became aware of in this young age. As there were: 01) It might sound a bit bathetic, but ""Titanic"" is a really romantic film, it's kind of a Love Manifesto. There are two people who really love each other, with all consequences. This is really great, to see this true and honest love between two people which you don't see too often in real life, even though this is just a movie.02) When you look a bit behind this romantic facade, ""Titanic"" is also a deeply social critical movie. On the one side, it shows those affectedly luxury and all those needless problems of the Rich, as well as the belief that with enough money you can buy anything (""We had an arrangement, Mr Murdoch!""). On the other side you see the misery of the Third Class people, you see how they are trapped in the sinking ship like animals, and you see how the Rich are treated much better only because they have money. But on the other hand, there is Rose, who only cares about Jack Dawson's personality and not about his financial situation.03) The last thing I love at this movie is quite simple: It is a great document of one of the sadest stories in younger human history. It shows it all in detail, the arrogance of the White Star Line people, the desperation of the passengers as the ship is sinking, the fight for their life, the desperate try to find other ships to help, all showed really realistic and also strictly written after the reports of survivors. I think those whole Titanic thing is very interesting, and so I like the movie for showing the happenings of this evening very realistic and fascinating.",Titanic

To have received so many votes of 10 AND so many responses of dissatisfaction among the membership here suggests to me that this movie does what any great movie should do:  inspire discussion.At the heart of ""Titanic"" are the compelling contradictions of the human experience:  the ingenuity of man balanced against his arrogance, the desires of power and elitism balanced against true and sacrificial love, and the continuing journey for gains both material and ethereal.  These contradictions are presented in a movie that is first-rate in every area of film-making.The two comments I most take exception to are:  that the movie is too long and that it was merely fodder for teenage girls' fantasies about young Leo D.  First, I love long movies, and with today's ever-increasing costs, I always feel like I'm truly getting my money's worth with a long movie.

1661,HistoryJonah,"Titanic- ""Could almost pass off as a great film"".",7,23 March 2010,"Watch the movie and you'll understand the title of this review. Titanic-I watch it several times a year, I own the soundtrack, Kate Winslet, Leonardo DiCaprio, Billy Zane, Victor Garber and Bernard Hill are among my favorite actors, and yet for me, the film is mixed.Everything in Titanic is uneven. Some performances are great, where as others leave much to be desired, there are some great lines in the film and others that are awful, etc. The primary problem is a lack of realism.First off with the story. How likely would it be that Jack would fall in love with Rose and risk his life for her if he knew her for only 3 days? I find the romantic scenes mixed, and while they have a few good moments, my favorite parts of the movie are when the ship sinks and with scenes with the crew and Billy Zane. Also the class envy lines get to a point of annoyance. The quarters in steerage on Titanic were some of the best. Rich and poor alike sacrificed their lives to save others as the ship went down. I really couldn't understand why James Cameron hated the rich saying he earned more money off of this film than any of the people on Titanic ever earned. Then the feminist lines grate on me too. Constantly throughout the film feminist messages are shown such as how women have tougher choices than men, how all the rich men are arrogant fools etc. I just have to wonder how many of the women on Titanic would still want to be treated the same way as men when the order 'women and children first was given'.Now that we're done with the movie's 'buisness and politics', let's take a look at the acting.DiCaprio-He's now one of my favorite actors, but I didn't care for him in this. He acting like an American tough guy did't exactly work, he'd been better off as a European artist. Part of it was the lines he was given (Such as 'I'm the king of the world'). He does get better as the film goes on.Winslet-Amazing in the film, perfectly cast and helps carry the movie.Billy Zane-If he weren't in it, I might not watch the movie. His portrayal of Cal, Rose's fiancée is outstanding. Maybe because his character is so unrealistically pompous and snobby (Even to the point where he pushes someone out of a life boat saying 'Get out, you'll swamp us!'. His lines are hilarious in the film, everything he says is great, I quote them all the time. My favorites are 'I put my faith in you good sir', 'Not even God could sink it', 'Twice the size of Moratania, and far more luxurious' and countless others. He really helps the movie.Supporting cast-Bill Paxton is solid, Victor Garber is underused but brilliant as the designer of the ship, Mr. Andrews. I love his line 'She's made of iron sir, and I assure you, she will sink'. Bernard Hill gives a good performance as the ship's Captain, all the crew members are great as well. I didn't care for Rose's mother, who I thought was too unrealistic in her hatred. Cal's henchman was also unrealistic, I mean that he would kill someone just for his boss' love? I don't know. The Digital effects are outstanding and a joy to watch. The music is amazing and my favorite score of all time. The cinematography, sets, costumes and sound is amazing. All in all, Titanic is a movie I mixed with. I watch it and I love certain moments, but cringe at others. I just wished they could have made a more balanced film to watch. Would I recommend it? Strongly, but I don't like it so much for the love story, as I do for the other elements of the film. It was the classic that wasn't.",Titanic
1662,rachelob_7,Complete perfection,9,30 August 2007,"I saw the hype of this movie and immediately thought it would be too much, and I decided not to see it in theatres. I made a huge mistake. In 2001, I saw it on television and couldn't believe it. This movie has an amazing script that kept me watching. The love story made me sigh and cry! Not saying what happens! Even though most people already know. Might be spoilers ahead! Anyways, the Jack and Rose story was enough for me, but after Titanic hit the iceberg it was like a completely different movie! I loved how they kept the love story ""afloat"" (haha) while the ship was sinking. There are so many elements to this movie that I can't even explain. Every time I watch it, I cry for Jack. Every single time. The fact that he loved her enough to sacrifice his life.. Wow. I mean, I can't get a man to open a door for me! Let alone, give me the door to float on while he freezes to death! That's love. The way this film plays out is amazing. All the special effects, the costumes, the acting! Don't even get me started about the acting! And even things right down to the sound the Lookout's bell makes. But.. I have to say, after the 80th time I watched the movie (or around there somewhere) I started to notice that some of the lines are just a little bit TOO cheesy. But that really is the only flaw in the 194 minutes of perfection. Some people I know won't watch the film because of the long running time. But I think if it was any shorter I wouldn't be satitsfiyed. i really wouldn't. All in all, this movie is beautiful. It makes me feel things I almost never feel.Complete perfection",Titanic

I will say one thing, though: James Cameron's Oscar acceptance speech was the most ridiculous acceptance speech I have ever heard. Never mind the ""I'm the king of the world!"" line. How about his moment of silence for those who perished on the Titanic? Perhaps Cameron felt obligated to acknowledge the dead since he was making millions dramatizing their tragedy. Perhaps he was being sincere in his sympathies. I don't know. What I do know is that it was one of the most cringe-worthy moments in Academy history. But Cameron doesn't stop there; he simply cannot leave good-enough alone, so he continues to babble on incessantly as his head continues to expand. Whereas most actors and filmmakers at least make an attempt to conceal their egotism, Cameron is unabashedly vainglorious, boldly forsaking the humility smokescreen that so many others in show business rely upon for refuge.",Titanic

The scene showing the ship leaving the dock looked so real! I was truly taken by the visual splendor on the screen. I also knew going in that the story and cast would be a bit of a disappointment. But I never expected the total letdown of those aspects of the film. The sappiness of the love story was just plain putrid and unworthy of the grand setting that was the Titanic. The portrayal of evil fiance by Billy Zane was one of the most ridiculous performances I've seen in years. If he had a moustache, he would have been twisting it like Snidely Whiplash! And, beware of the little spoiler here, the scene in which he chases Jack and shoots at him, all while thousands are dying around them, had me laughing with the cruel absurdity of it all, earning me a stiff elbow in the ribs from my wife.

Those are original films that deserved the best picture award. I don't know how anyone can watch L.A. Confidential and not wonder why that film did not win best picture.

Billy Zane as Rose's controlling fiancé does a great job at being despicable. Frances Fisher matches the rest of the cast with her talent.The special effects are fantastic and they never overpower the story.

So much of the dialoge has nothing to do with the plot line of the movie, and the rest of it just repeats what the audience already knows.  The love story is very typical of every movie and offers no difference to any other love story out of Hollywood these days.  It has a very cookie cutter story line.

This is a childish, foolish movie where we are somehow expected to care about the adolescent cravings of two cardboard ""characters"".  I put the word ""characters"" in quotation marks as the reality is that anything approaching a realistic person is sorely absent from this picture.  Types and stereotypes are all we get (and a lot of hammy acting - Billy Zane stick to ""Tales from the Crypt: Demon Night"", please; your over-the-top posturing was perfect in that, not so in this).  Prior to its release there were rumours that ""Titanic"" was going to be a turkey. Doesn't anyone see those rumours were proved correct?  If you want a real filmic account of the sinking of the Titanic, full of real characters, real intelligence and real feeling (and made with a tiny fraction of the budget of Cameron's bloated epic), just watch ""A Night to Remember"" (1958).  Of course you won't have that hilarious scene where the kissing kids distract the night watchman from the iceberg, but you might see a more authentic account and a truly memorable movie.",Titanic

We all knew James Cameron, he made ""The Terminator"" in 1984, Aliens in 1986, and ""Terminator 2"" in 1991, all of them decent (not great) action flicks, with one common denominator, LOTS OF MONEY. And that is James Cameron about, he spends and earns tons of money, because (Regardless of your love or your hate for him) he makes the right choices. Avatar sucked, just putting it out there. But what was that worked so much about Titanic?. We might say that Leo DiCaprio or Kate Winslet, or the huge budget of which we where all informed of. I want to think that it was the Leo-Mania, of women that time, after Romeo+Juliet and ""Who's eating Gilbert Grape"", or the fact that it got unbelievable amount of money for it advertising, or the good visual effects, or the Oscar swept, or the lazy, easy to entertain story, or the bland characters, which everybody could be identified with, cause it's easy to identify with so general personalities. I wanna believe that, but it is not true in a whole. Well, it's true in part, but the greatest factor of the success of this film, was truly it 's quality. Not it's story, nor it's characters, those where clichéd and bland (But entertaining, it was an entertaining story told a million times, not like ""Avatar"", a lousy story told a million times). The fact that Rose and Jack know each other for about two days and decide to risk their lives for each other is pretty distracting, but, what the hell, Disney did that to us in all of it's movies. So, why 7 stars if I think all this crap about this movie? Because this movie is great, really great, I don't want it to be, but just look at it, it's so big, it's so fancy, the costume, the production, the visual effects, the amazing cinematography, the pacing, everything was correct, and makes you feel this three hours film like a two hours film, you want more, and not because it let you expecting more, just because it was amazing, and you want to see that again. So, to sum up. I don't see this as a great story, and I don't believe characters where great, but technically it was one of the most complete movies ever released. Look at the Oscars it won. Best Picture, Best director,Best editing, Best Cinematography, Best sound, Best sound effects, Best costume design, Best art direction, Best Visual effects, Best song and best score. And I agree with all of them, I think it is amazing visually and has a great score, even if I hate ""My heart will go on"" (Maybe it was Celine's Dion fault), and acting wasn't awful neither, regardless of the blandness of the characters, Kate Winslet was very good, Billy Zane was a nice over the top villain, and Leo DiCaprio was Okey (Just okay). So, I really like this movie, I can watch it over and over, even do it's not at all perfect, or it has way more cons than pros, it's hypnotizing, its easy to watch, it was made with a lot of effort and it shows, it's full atmosphere, full visual, and a relaxing story and characters. PS: The greatest part of the movie was, without a doubt, the sinking, specially on cinema.",Titanic
1676,andmaybethen,If you look past the media hype....its a good movie,8,19 April 2004,"*SPOILERS, though if you haven't seen this movie, like it or hate it, you've been living under a rock*Ok, I was 9 when I saw Titanic first, and maybe I was born wrong, but I was able to see Titanic as a good piece of film making. If you get past all the oscars and the media hype and how many times they played that sodding song on the radio....it's just a good movie. With great performances. And after we all realized that Leonardo DiCaprio isn't THAT good looking...we sort of forgot about it. And of course we got sick of it, but nowadays we find ourselves dusting off our VHS copies of Titanic, just to see if it matched the calibur of Return of the King, because they both have the same amout of Oscars.The first two hours are pretty happy, and if you're a tough critic, you'd call it mediocre. But that last hour and a half, are PHENOMONAL. As soon as the ship hits that iceberg, we're ready for it after being subjected to Kate and Leo making love. And the special effects and the story in those last 1.5 hours are so tragic and so sad. I found myself caring more about the other passengers than Rose and Jack because you know one of em lives!I'd say the best performances in the movie is a tie between Kate Winslet(Rose) and Billy Zane(Cal). Leo is good, not fabulous, but good, and when he uses what he's given, he does fine. Kathy Bates is awesome as Molly Brown. I've seen the deleted scenes in Titanic, and they should've kept em in, because it gives you alot more about the characters then we get. Bernard Hill(Captain Smith) is pretty good and so are Frances Fisher(Ruth DeWitt Bukater) and Gloria Stewart(Old Rose). I love Victor Garber as Mr. Andrews. Danny Nucci(Fabrizio) and Jason Barry(Tommy Ryan) are pretty promising actors. The dialogue is pretty good.Overall Titanic is brilliant visually, and beautifully heartbreaking mentally. The high note of the whole movie: James Horner's musical score. That man is a musical god. Listen to the soundtrack, folks. i recommend #'s 1,3,5,12,15. #15 especially.Titanic is a goods movie people. Get over it.",Titanic
1677,segustafson,Absorlutely God-awful,1,1 July 2008,"I finally, finally broke down to watch this (I know, I know, it took some time to do it) and now I know why it took me so long. My Lord, this sorry excuse for a movie is just plain awful. I haven't experience this much movie-viewing pain since trying to sit through Brokeback Mountain, another highly overrated, badly acted, sorry excuse of time and effort. Sappy dialog, boring, over-the-top characters, dull and predictable storyline, and so on and so on. The costume designs, set decorations, cinematography, and special effects were definitely worthy of notice, but nothing else. And to realize that this worthless piece of trash won the Best Picture Oscar over L.A. Confidential, a brainy, stylish, police drama, is unbelievably pathetic. But then again, I have noticed that most of the viewing public, including critics and Hollywood, don't like to think too much. In that case, this movie's for you!",Titanic
1678,sumeena-rakwal,My all time favorite movie,10,26 May 2011,"I have seen the movie so many times that i remember the dialouges now. And every-time i see i feel like there is something new to it. It is the most amazing, wonderful movie i have ever seen. James Cameroon could not have got better actors than Leonardo and Kate Winslet to this movie. I have fallen in love with Jack since the first time i saw this movie. Never really occurred i could write a review about it, but today when i am watching it again and had my laptop just next to me thought of opening my heart. The music, gosh i have never loved background score of any movie as much i love Titanic's. The band that plays when ship is sinking, the song my heart will go on- well nothing needs to be said about that. I have been fantasizing this kind of love and romance ever since i saw this movie. It is one grand movie ever made, you cannot not like even a single part of this one. I really want Titanic to have a sequel in which Jack would come alive somehow with some logic or something. This movie took my heart away, its astoundingly beautiful and mesmerizing. Jack Dawson is my love and Titanic will remain my favorite movie ever.",Titanic
1679,lestatlove19,So Beautiful. So Tragic. So Good!!!!!,10,21 February 2011,"If only the voting ratings were higher than 10 . . . I would give this grand film a 20. I watched it for the first time about four years ago or so, and let me just say, I bawl like a baby every time I watch it. It remains my absolute favorite movie. I LOVE the chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack & Kate Winslet's Rose (you just don't see romances like that anymore, which is a shame). I enjoy watching their romance grow until the very end. James Cameron was right in making sure that the audience gets an ""emotional doorway"", to use his words, to realize just how tragic the Titanic disaster really was by having them, as well as Jack & Rose, go through the events that led to the sinking . . . Did Cal Hockley (Billy Zane) ever do stuff like the things Jack did for Rose, risking his life because he loved her so much? I don't think so, because he didn't really care about her, or even love her for that matter . . . so Billy Zane did a fantastic job at portraying this character you just love to hate! All the other actors in this film, particularly Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Gloria Stuart, & Bill Paxton, did fabulous as well. The scenery, the music (makes me cry even if I hum a few bars), the costumes, etc are FABULOUS! James Cameron, you are a genius & will be forever remembered for this epic masterpiece, for bringing this tragedy that happened a century ago, to astounding life!!!!! I applaud you for this tenfold. Bravo! Well done!",Titanic

Come on people, sitting through 2 hours of poor dialog just to see 10 minutes of nice special effects is no excuse for giving this movie anything more then a rating of 2 or 3 (4 if you are generous). A movie should be judged on the sum of all of its components. While the special effects in this movie would warrant an 8 or 9, the characters sucked, the plot was quite lame, and the movie was slow up until the boat sank. I regret wasting 2 hours of my life on this movie, and wish that I could have walked in on the last 10 minutes, rather then sat through it. The things men do for our girlfriends...",Titanic
1682,donnadonut1983-167-897991,A brilliant masterpiece that brings the audience in,10,30 September 2011,"There has been so many movies about the Titanic before but what makes this one stand so high above the rest is that it actually brings the audience in where it no longer feels like another fact based story that we all know about. It becomes much more than that. I can appreciate some peoples criticism over the movie being based on 2 fictional characters and that they feel it overshadowed the sinking of the great ship but in my opinion, that's why we, as an audience feel so overwhelmed. With these 2 characters we get to learn what it was like for the poor as well as the rich and many people lost their loved ones that night so really I feel that the ship was full of Rose and Jack's. I admit it really takes off when the ship hits the iceberg and it was great to follow these characters right until the ship sinks. James Cameron has done a brilliant job of bringing the audience in because you find yourself constantly asking ""What if that was me?"". I feel that this movie certainly does the ship and all those actual people on it justice. It's a tragic reminder of what they actually went through. Fantastic movie and I don't want to spoil this movie completely but you really need your tissues at the end.",Titanic
1683,wanda-kling,Truly Amaaaazing!!,9,29 February 2012,"On the surface, the plot lines and basic story seem trite and contrived (poor boy meets rich girl). The fantastic acting by the leads and the direction of the massive cast of extras along with the superhuman attention to detail are what makes Titanic jump from the screen at the viewer.Think about the whole ""king of the world"" sequence with Jack and Fabrizio and the ""flying"" sequence with Jack and Rose. In the hands of a lesser director, both of these would have come across as self-aggrandizing pap, but the way both scenes is shot and Leo DeCaprio/Kate Winslet's uncanny abilities and chemistry sent a shot of ecstasy throughout the whole theater. These scenes, along with several others, works well to capture the fabulous grandeur of the original Titanic.What is most often missed in reviews are the performances of actors in lesser roles, such as Billy Zane's turn as an elegant cad, David Warner's perfect casting as the classy ""thug"" bodyguard, Kathy Bates nailing her gauche, nouveau riche embodiment of the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown (she was a last minute casting), and scores of other astounding recreations from the captain to the top hatted billionaire and his eyes popping out when the water floods the stateroom.According to the trivia page, cinemas wore out their copies and needed replacements. People have probably also worn out their VHS, DVD and blue-ray copies. Nothing will wear out the enduring appeal of this classic as pure, full-on entertainment.",Titanic
1684,vincent-carsel,The Greatest Movie of all time? Hardly. . .,5,23 March 2012,"Titanic is the #1 grossing film of all time. Big deal. The star of the movie is a ship, not Leo or Kate.I will admit that the film is a technical masterpiece. The special effects, cinematography, editing, production design, and all of the other ""back-stage"" elements are simply superb.While ""Titanic"" unarguably cost an enormous amount of money, it's easy to see why. The money is right up on the screen, in all its glory, for all to see. Yet, is it fair to say that a film is great when only half of it truly is? I don't think so. On that note, I base my overall rating, knowing that it would have been far better if only Cameron swallowed his pride, put his ego on the shelf for a moment, and hired someone else to write the screenplay. Unfortunately, he didn't, so we have to suffer for it.So half a good movie is a 5/10",Titanic

1686,audission,Tries to be all things to all people,3,16 April 2005,"It's a love story. A blockbuster. An historical account. A thriller. An action-fest. It's art-house. It's popcorn. It's.. it's... all of these and none.Many others have gone over the historical inaccuracies in great detail so I will try and avoid mentioning them again, but as someone with a lifelong interest in the Titanic story Cameron's film is immensely frustrating. I have a lot of respect for James Cameron. He is a true master of spectacle, and although I've never met the guy I can imagine he is a grade-A control freak; whatever the criticisms of his films, you do not get to make a $200+ million dollar flick without being well and truly disciplined to your art. The detail is all there: the light fittings, crockery, engine room; the beautiful ship brought back to life in full colour, the bridge/bow/boat deck etc - a small army of crew working to build and light the set, costume designers and so on. The film should be recognized as a huge technical accomplishment for these reasons.Yet the film fails for one very simple reason: storyline.The appeal of the real Titanic story is multifold. It was never ""just a shipwreck"" - ships sink all the time, some larger than the Titanic, some with many more losses (the Lusitania is comparable, yet far less populist) - but the sinking marked the end of a period of human arrogance. No matter how technologically adept we become, fate can always intervene and scupper our best laid plans. No one thinks planes are ""uncrashable"" or that we can somehow buy immunity from a grisly fate. And since the real people on board the Titanic represented every walk of society, from billionaires to those starting a new life, the fact that rich and poor perished together on this brand new ship altered our thinking. When the story starts there are four classes of people: First class, second class, third class ('steerage') and crew. By the end, there are two: living and dead.If the real story was fictional, it could not be dreamt up better. There are so many iconic moments to savour they would barely fit into a 3 hours film: Passengers requesting bits of the 'berg to put in their drinks, the Californian's wireless operator going to sleep, the growing realisation that something is seriously wrong etc -the list is endless. So if it is one of the most enduring stories of human behaviour and ""nature vs man"", why do we need Cameron's wafer-thin plot? As a Titanic buff I watch the special effects with delight. The ship is back from the deep, no question. But I find myself willing Jack and Rose to get out of the way. There are some many fascinating 'real' characters that we never get to more than acknowledge. What makes THEM tick? I get the feeling Cameron is fascinated too, but restrained by the demands of a teenage popcorn audience, who've failed to imagine that a poor boy falling in love with a super-rich girl and sacrificing himself in 24 hours is complete ""poppycock"" (1912) - or in Cameron-speak, ""a bunch of horses**t"" (1997).(Incidentally, if I was a first class passenger on the Titanic, I would feel slightly aggrieved I'd paid so much, since in Cameron's version it seems all passengers are free to wander anywhere they like. Except when it starts sinking of course, then suddenly it's impossible to get above decks.) Head for your nearest iMax cinema and watch ""Ghosts of the Abyss"" - Cameron's slightly cheesy but good documentary featuring much more of the underwater scenes from the film. Or for a more accurate retelling of the story try 1958's A Night To Remember. If you want a love story, go for Romeo and Juliet. For a ""people out of their time"" film, try Les Visiteurs or Bill and Ted.In short, TITANIC tries to be all of these things, and excels at none of them.",Titanic

Usually guys say they hate it because they do not like romance stories. These are the people that think explosions make a movie and romance is for girls only. I beg to differ. Who wrote this movie? A male. Okay, so presumably the number 1 reason for disliking this movie is the romance. That is diminished by me, so is there any other reasons to hate it? NO! If anyone can say anything that's bad about this movie, try to, because you will be wrong.

The instant love at first sight scene? The ""She's not for you"" advice? The way Kate Winslet changes the moment she sees the rich woman mistreating her daughter? The evil fiancée? The lively and dancing 3rd class people? It is just far too silly and contrived.There's also one thing that bothers me. Everyone is happy that Leo and Kate are reunited at the end. Well, she got married and had kids, didn't she? So, that means she probably spend several years with a husband. So...instead of the father of her children, she wants to spend eternity with a guy she met as a teenager for 5(!) days? I'd be royally mad off if I was the guy.",Titanic

Ismay : ""But this ship can't sink...!""

Now I admit it is a chic flick in some ways, but in NO way is this a bad film. It IS a work of Art by James Cameron, just an absolute thrilling story line, and the graphics, man, the graphics are some of the best work ever done on a film. I don't believe this movie or story can ever be out done and should never be re-done. This is a passionate, moving, yet visually breathtaking piece of work. Leonardo DiCaprio no doubt has his best performance of his life, and Kate Winslet, whew, just as sexy as can be, plays a very emotional role as Rose. Jack and Rose fall in love as all of us wish we could. But as we all know it comes to a tragic end as the titanic meets the floor of the Northern Atlantic Ocean.

This film I've seen it many times and every time I feel an incredible feeling, it is precisely for this reason that Titanic is a masterpiece, because as many films do not ever get tired of seeing him always and every time you feel the same emotion as if it were the first time personally I can not even find a flaw in the film, I think the points that make a moving film Titanic and that leaves its mark are: the soundtrack by James Horner, the song My Heart Will Go On Celine Dion, dazzling special effects , photography Russell Carpenter and incredible interpretation of Kate Winslet. Unfortunately, the Cinema today has had many changes compared to what it once was, most of the movies they make today are trash films, Cinema today's needs instead of movies like Titanic, one of a kind and that will leave a mark in the heart and mind. Winner of 11 Academy Awards in 1998 (all deserved): Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Production Design, Best Special Effects, Best Original Score, Best Song, Best Editing, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Costume Design, I conclude saying that Titanic is a masterpiece and is one of the best films ever made.",Titanic

Haven't we already seen movies like this? And the fact that this cliché and mediocre film received a s**load of Oscar nomination proves how dumb Oscar become. The only reason this movie made a s**load of money in box office is because of these girl teenagers. Seems to me Hollywood is making rehash films just like this movie.

It is a movie that has helped shape the future of Hollywood's movie style - the movie that set the box office on fire, the greatest movie of our time.Not only is the movie in itself great but there are many other redeeming qualities to it. For example; the lighting and color contrast it superb. (Just watch the scene when Kal (Billy Zane) presents the ""heart of the Ocean"" to Rose (Kate Winslet). The color in the room and the colors used on Kate's character are simply inspiring.The story is another excellent quality of the Titanic. The way that James Cameron makes you feel watching it. You can lose yourself in Kate's character. She is being pushed into so many things, she is on the edge of giving up and at the last possible second Leonardo pops up and saves her. Its brilliant and not necessarily expected.Finally, the Titanic has an awesome air of having fun and breaking free. This is especially shown in the third class party scene below the deck, when Kate dances with Leo. It is also shown in the scene right before the collision with the iceberg, when Kate tells Leo that ""when the ship docks, I'm getting off with you"".So there you have it. An excellent movie I give a 10 out of 10. The lighting and color contrast are great, the story is excellent, and the air of fun is evident. Add in Billy Zane with eyeliner and the modern day heart throb Leonardo Dicaprio and what's not to love?",Titanic

1696,dinnerbuddy,A wonderfully acted movie with a beautiful script and full of life.,10,26 June 2005,"The movie is wonderful. That's all I can say. I recommend that you watch this. It made me cry, it made me laugh, but it just - overall - was wonderful. That is basically the only word to describe it. A poor guy, Jack Dawson, falls in love with a rich woman, Rose DeWitt Bukater. Rose is forced to marry a rich man, Cal Hockley by her mother. Rose, of course, doesn't love him back, but more likely loves Jack. She doesn't realize this until the scene where they are at the front of the boat and she is ""flying."" Throughout the movie, Rose and Jack's love blossoms into a beautiful romance. Her mother is mad, and her fiancée is furious, but Jack and Rose don't care, but rather love each other more. Jack has nothing to offer Rose, and he knows it. That's all I can say without getting too detailed. Basically, every part of this film was wonderful. It was delicate and it was sad. I recommend that you watch this. If you like sad and romance, this is definitely a movie for you. I usually don't like sad movies, but this movie has turned me to it, instead against it. To tell the tale short, it's my favorite movie, and I'm sure it's many other's too.",Titanic

It gives a great insight of how tragic this story was and the toll of lives that were lost back in 1912. A movie like this that makes you feel like you were there even though something like this happened 90 years ago it exceptional movie making. Impossible to top, no wonder James Cameron hasn't made another movie since! The story of the vanity and the old ways of classes and how things were in the 1900's before the upheavals that took place like the Russian Revolution, WW!, WW2, etc shows how things were back then.

1698,kiwis_rule91,i love it and whats with all of the negativity about Celine's love song?!,10,1 May 2005,"Personally, I loved this movie. I am only 13 years old so obviously wasn't able to see it when it came out in cinemas! I first saw Titanic the movie when I was about 10 or 11 years old and I'll tell you now, I absolutely loved it then, and nothing has changed over the years! When I was about 10 I had this major crush on Leonardo DiCaprio and so I mainly watched it the first time to see him! But, as I watched it, I was so moved and I appreciated it for more than just a hot guy! I loved the parts that you just remember no matter how long it's been since you last saw the movie, like when Jack saves Rose from committing suicide, when they ""fly"" on the bow of the boat, when Jack draws Rose nude on the couch, when the ship gets hit by the ice berg and people are playing with the ice, when that woman sings her children to sleep because she recognizes that their fate is death.. the list goes on! The movie, while parts are not strictly accurate, is mostly accurate. Obviously, some characters such as Jack and Rose were fictional people made up as icing on the cake, but there were some people who actually did board that ship such as Mr. Bruce Ismay, Captain Smith, Mr. John Jacob Aster and several others. However, what really gets me is why a man who is actually said to have acted heroically was portrayed as he was, shooting a passenger and then swallowing his gun! All of you who have seen this movie know exactly who I'm talking about. That was another part that you can't forget no matter how long ago you last saw this movie.What's with all of the negativity concerning Celine Dion's song My Heart Will Go On?! I personally love that song and think it goes perfectly with the story line. It's perfect for it, as it resembles the ending, Rose living on while Jack dies and Rose would never stop loving Jack, and that shows in the way that modern-day Rose talks about him in the movie. It's a beautiful song if you can actually appreciate it for what it means in relation to the story line of the movie. I guess, if you're not a big Celine Dion fan you wouldn't like the song anyway, but even if you don't hate her but don't love her, if you could open your heart and your mind and accept it for what it means in relation to the characters, you could love the song just as I do.The movie is so emotionally moving. I know that I for one, am not a big crier, in fact, I hardly ever cry, but Titanic the movie moved me so much that I cried and couldn't stop for quite some time! The part where the woman sings her children to sleep because she has accepted the fate of certain doom was the scene that made me cry the most. It's so sad...This is truly a masterpiece by James Cameron. The people who are now claiming that they hate it and that they never cried when they went to see it in the movies, you either need to stop dissing it when people say they love it 'cos if you're not moved by something like that, you're either cold-hearted or inhuman; or just get over it, because from what I've heard, in most cinemas where it was shown, there wasn't a dry eye in the house! It doesn't make you look cool or tough if you start dissing a movie like Titanic. Sure, sometimes the script gets a bit mushy, but that's what makes it so sad when it comes to the end, even if you already know what's gonna happen but that don't mean that you can just start dissing it cos the mushy wording and actions are what give the ending such an emotional feel.My advice, if you're looking for twists and turns and suspense, sooo not the flick for you. Also, if you don't dig mushy script, probably not for you. However, if you don't mind a movie that you already pretty much know the ending that has no twists or anything filled with suspense and you don't mind mushy script GO SEE IT! If you think you can appreciate the music and the script for what it is supposed to represent, you will totally dig it. I did.",Titanic
1699,stormarm,"Ship: Great, Script: Bad, Message: Evil",5,11 April 2005,"If you're a Titanic buff and love Edwardian period pieces, you'll like the first scenes where they're exploring the wreck, be captivated by Kate Winslet's entrance, love the montage of the ship setting sail, and then be bored to death, if not absolutely disgusted, until the ship starts to sink.Yes, the ""love"" story is saccharine and cliché, the script utterly formulaic, uninspired and just plain dumb, and the characters so card-board and tissue-thin you'd think they'd have turned to papier-mache before they drowned. The costumes and sets were truly magnificent though, and the special effects superb -- if building a 9/10 scale replica of the actual ship and then sinking it on film can be called ""a special effect"". If nothing else, Cameron deserves great acclaim for the unprecedented scale and un-equaled ambitiousness of the technical side of this film.Despite the movie's reputation for the accuracy of its historic details, there are more than a few inaccuracies, some innocent, some outright despicable. An example of the first kind would be ""the formal dinner"" scene, which had the First Class passengers dining in what was in fact the First Class Smoking Lounge, rather than the First Class Dining Room (which shows up only briefly as the backdrop for Billy Zane's shooting rampage). Of the latter kind, probably the worst was the locked gates trapping the 3rd Class passengers below decks - and a crew determined to keep them there: historically, on the real ship, there were locked gates that kept the 3rd Class passengers from wandering into the 1st & 2nd class areas, but these ""gates"" were only 3' high and could be easily climbed - or stepped - over. The 3rd class passengers were not kept below, neither were they denied access to the life-boats. The problem was that most of the 3rd class were Scandinavians who spoke no English and most of the Titanic's stewards spoke no Swedish, Norwegian, or Danish. When they were told to get up on deck, they just went to the 3rd class deck on the fantail. The stewards then tried to lead the women and children up to the boat decks, but, not understanding, most of them refused to leave their men. This ""inaccuracy"" in the movie was of course just the product of a little poetic license, helping to re-enforce the deep, moral, and thoroughly original message of the film: ""poor people: good - rich people: bad!""What reviewers seem always to miss is that Kate Winslet's character is not much of a heroine. Rose is, down to the last detail, a snide, rude, arrogant, superior, sanctimonious, self-centered, self-obsessed, vindictive, cruel, confused, conflicted, and utterly self-righteous little know-it-all of a princess, at once proud and insecure -- i.e., you're typical teen-age American girl, which probably is the real reason the movie was so popular with adolescent females.",Titanic
1700,jayfull2003,An amazing little gem,10,23 August 2005,"Unfourntunatly, with how good this movie is, it really never reached the mainstream attention that a movie with a budget like this deserves or expects. When i mention ""Titanic"" people say, ""oh, you mean the one with josh hartnet?"" and usually i say, ""well, no, you must be thinking of Tora Tora Tora."" This little known example of Leondaro DiCaprios debut into film showcases what range he has as an actor. As is the case with many, he had to start small using this small independent-type film as a jumping board to get into the mainstream attention. Best of luck to leo. Before I saw this movie, i never had seen any scenes involving jack and rose. Every moment from the start was new to me, and made me realize exactly how much I didn't know until about the movie until i saw it on the screen. Its very sad, and a few people i know actually admitted to crying (!) when it was over, (i know) but the emotion doesn't take away from the neat little motion picture. The most remarkable thing about this film was its charm and slow yet deliberate pacing. the subtle climax blew me off my feet, and not spoil anything, (SPOILER ALERT), when the (gasp) boat sank i did NOT see that coming!Anyway, in all, if you want to take the time to travel a little off the beaten path, take a look at titanic, and amaze your movie buff friends when they say, ""heard of James Camerons first picture?"" you'll say, ""HELL YES!!""",Titanic

1702,amerribrit,No magic,1,10 October 2005,"When this film came out in the late 90's, I made a vow that I would not see it in the movie theatre. I kept to my vow but God in his infinite wisdom made sure I saw it. On a trans-Atlantic flight the feature presentation was Titanic. I took it as a sign and I watched the film, I was preparing to be whisked away into the film but I was only slapped by it. I found the acting to be dreadful and the dialogue between the characters was awkward at best. I used to be a fan of James Horner but listening to the soundtrack I was torn, was I listening to Braveheart or snippets from Apollo 13(which was a reconstituted score of Sneakers)? Nearing the end of the flight and the film during the promise scene between Rose and Jack with the line ""I'll never let go"" I mumbled ""let the buggar sink"" a little too loudly and was shushed loudly and got dirty looks. Sorry, but the line was so corny and the delivery was not believable. The reason this is being written nearly 8 years later is that fact that Titanic was on today and I wanted to give it a second chance. With this viewing I was again struck with the herky-jerky dialogue, bad acting and Continuity problems galore! With the tagline of Titanic being the biggest budgeted film of the time where was the money for continuity and anachronisms. A ten minute search on the internet would has solved many problems. Artistically this film is good yet when I pay my 8-9 well earned bucks for a film I want to be transported away for 2-3 hours. With this film I was not transported anywhere, I sat in my seat and I was aware of my seat and that I was rolling my eyes.",Titanic

1704,lucyyy,Review of one of the greatest adventures and love stories in movie history,9,30 September 2014,"Many love stories have the same plot. They are predictable and boring, and by the end of the film viewers are done watching the couple kiss and be cutesy. However, The Titanic ties in not only a love story, but an adventure, an intense inner battle, and a mortifying loss. From the beginning of the film, viewers are attached to Jack Dawson, feeling like they want him to succeed. So when they see how how happy Jack is that he won a ticket on the RMS Titanic, viewers want nothing more for the poor and extremely attractive boy to be happy. Jack and Rose have a love that is almost sickening, but the affection they show each other makes viewers want to experience a crazy love story of their own. It is nice to see a rich girl let her guard down and be herself around Jack, something that is lost in the craziness of every day life, and the fact that it is human nature to try and impress people we like. When watching the Titanic everyone (I hope) knew what would happen at the end, but it was heartbreaking to see Rose's lover's life come to an end. Honestly, I think they both could have fit on the old door when they were waiting to be rescued, but there had to be a heartbreaking tragedy that leaves one crying on the couch wanting to dive into the ocean to bring Jack Dawson back to life. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are phenomenal actors, and they have amazing chemistry together on and off screen.",Titanic
1705,lambsarepets,Unfair Hate,10,11 September 2008,"I really don't understand why people hate Titanic. On a pure technical level, it was groundbreaking, the span and width of an epic film was faceted in this film. There's a reason why it won 11 Academy Awards and is still the most grossing film unadjusted for inflation. If movie tickets had been the same price as it was in 1997/98, The Dark Knight would have to make $900 million dollars to catch up to the amount of tickets Titanic sold.The success of Titanic was not because of schoolgirls fawning over a story of lost love. That is a delusion. When people think of Titanic now, they feel embarrassed because they fell in love with the movie when it came out, but now, for some reason, deem it too corny. It deserves everything and anything it got, award and money-wise.82 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, yet an incredibly unfair 7.2 on IMDb. James Cameron fans know that both his dream projects Battle Angel (2010?) and Avatar (2009) would have never come in to fruition if it wasn't for Titanic.Titanic is big, bold, touchingly uncynical film-making. Was it the acting that made it fail? No. Leo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are doing mighty fine in terms of their careers. Was it the story? Old-fashioned story-telling was the highlight of many top critics, according to RT. And to many people, though they may be reluctant to say it, had their tear ducts on full mode at the end of the movie.Watch it again, and this time without your preconceived bias and prejudice. Watch it with a clean slate, and you will realize that the talk is really just.. talk.Till the day I die, I will defend this incredibly clever, classy and colossal piece of epic cinema. I can't bear to see it wither away like this.Titanic will forever be in my top movies list.",Titanic

This Scene Caused The Movie To Be Purely Commercial & Perhaps Rated R For Nudity.In My Opinion James Cameron's Movie Could Have Been So Much Better Without This Unnecessary Nudity Scene Unless He Wants To Attract People To Seeing It. We Know Very Much How Nudity & Sex Sells!.,Titanic
1707,haadurin,This movie SUCKS!,1,31 December 2005,"The acting and the screenplay were horrible, and DiCaprio sucked so badly!! Dang, my brain hurts just thinking about how much this really really really sucked! It's the worst movie i've ever seen, except for Batman begins, that is! Oohhh god this really really sucked, and I hated this so much, I saw it one time, and then i got it as a gift on DVD. Well guess what, I burned the DVD. Jesus, this is definitely the worst movie ever to disgrace the freaking planet. I wish the entire Titanic crew had blown up in some fuel explosion accident. DiCaprio should be DiCapitated. Also, the romance was so stiff and the dialogue was so horrid, that I cringe just thinking of a single line. Why doesn't everyone who worked on this film get lined up and shot?

This is a movie that is SO touching, SO precise in the making of the boat, the acting and the storyline is BRILLIANT! And the preciseness of the ship makes it even more outstanding!

1710,bellerococo,definitely top movies in the world,10,26 May 2015,"Titanic, one of the fine movies in the world, it was so impressed me. Love has no borders, hierarchies. One of the most touching scenes from the movie was the band members playing their instruments to calm passengers even as the ship was sinking. And the ship was sinking more and more faster. It's a tragic event and story. But Many people may felt it was beautiful story, even if it is so catastrophic.The Titanic collided with a glacier and sank to the bottom of the ocean. When I was a little kid, I really hated the glacier..And I cried with my brother. This was so special gigantic movie.And even now, I can't forget about the last scene. Many dramas and films copy that scene. In the last scene, they were living and smiling. Because of the end of the scene, I cried a lot. This movie was so beautiful and touching.",Titanic
1711,Justjsm,Love and Promises kept Forever,10,28 May 2015,"When the movie was released, I was just 2 years old and I have no idea what was going on. I watched the movie when I was 12 and didn't get it all because English is not my first language. But I remember that it's the first movie that brought me to tears. And then I watched the movie 2 years ago, I was 17 years old (year 2012). That's when I fully understand the story. And this year I rewatched the movie. And still I feel the same way as I was years ago. What can I say?!? I'm really moved and to be honest, I talked about it with my friends the whole week and they all laugh at me because it's been years that Titanic was released and they said that I can't move on about the film, and that I'm obsessed about it. Well I raised my forehead and proudly said ""YES I AM.""HELLO?! That's titanic! You're a complete idiot if you're not moved by the story and if you don't find yourself googling about it, thinking about what could've happened if Jack was still alive, and you can't get enough of it. I may not have my own Jack, but this film really makes me feel that I have one. Jack's life was full of happiness and adventure. While Rose suffered from being prison by her family's decision. Jack sacrifices his life for Rose to have a life that she always wanted, to see the world in a different perspective. Love and promises kept her alive and Jack is a big part of it. True love really last forever as long as you have that person in your thoughts and inside your heart. True love is about making sacrifices. True love is a promise kept forever.",Titanic
1712,silvergirl606,It could have been a masterpiece,5,5 April 2006,"This movie was loved and then it was loved to be hated.Personally, it drives me crazy. It had amazing effects, a great secondary cast and extras and the sinking scene is one of the most stomach wrenching things I have ever seen in a movie.But James Cameron CANNOT write dialog. Unless it was already based on something that happened in reality it was awful. And it wasn't DiCaprio or Winslet's faults as they aren't bad when they're not talking and they have been great in other things.Not to mention, yes you can certainly watch a documentary if you want the true story of the Titanic, but that doesn't change one simple fact. The real story is more interesting than a stilted generic love story.So many things not included in the movie... Charles Lightoller and twenty other men standing on an overturned life-boat for hours in freezing water is somehow less interesting than Cal Hockley the most generic villain I have seen on screen in a long time.So why do I bother watching? Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews is heart-breaking and probably the best thing in the movie. I also love the man who plays Wallace Hartley, the entire ""Nearer My God to Thee"" scene is fantastic.Or when Winslet and DeCaprio finally shut up, they have a good scene or two. When Rose is being lowered in a lifeboat and looking up at Jack, and when Rose and some minor characters exchange these amazing little looks as they wait on the stern for the ship to go down.There is some great eye-acting in this movie. Victor Garber, the man playing William Murdoch. The priest in the sinking scene as praying people grab his hands. Most of the extras and the people in the life-boats.But Jmes Cameron's dull fiction and dreadful dialog kills the movie. It's a lot shorter the way I watch it, a lot gets fast forwared. But I keep watching because when the movie is great, it's great.It would have been a masterpiece if Cameron had stuck to reality. Not because it was reality, but because it was a thousand times more interesting than a stilted love story.A better writer than Camron would be hard pressed to write fiction more interesting than the reality of that night.""A Night to Remember"" is much, much, better but ""Titanic"" is a good-ish could have been amazing movie that I can't help but go back to for its quality elements.",Titanic

It also had some sad parts such as when Rose tries to get Jack to wake up because the boat has arrived, and discovers that he has died and when she lets go of him, she stares at his face as he sinks down to the bottom. I actually cried after watching this. It was actually pretty cool when the guy on the new boat asks what Rose's name is, she says ""Rose. Rose Dawson.'' That proved how much she loved him. Basically, this is a great movie to watch and you can see what kind of thing happened when the real Titanic was sinking. I give this movie 10/10 all the way.",Titanic

Both have a romance on the ship while it's being destroyed and sinking. Only some of the crew survived. On the one hand I think that the theme is good and very interesting as it is based on a real event, but on the other hand in my opinion it's too long and it can be boring. But if you like this type of film you will enjoy it all the time. In 1h 18m a servant from Rose is brushing her hair while they are talking, and this moment is very tedious. Although, in 2h 30m there are the best minutes as Jack and Rouse have their moment alone and they dance.",Titanic

If James Cameron never makes another film he can always be proud of this movie. Some people say, ""it's just about a boat sinking"". How naive they are. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are amazing as Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukator. I saw this movie three times at the theaters, and would go again today if it were re-released. I still get goosebumps watching the ""flying scene"" and the ""heaven scene"". No other movie can compete with this one. How dare the Oscars not nominate Leo for his performance. Kate Winslet was robbed in my opinion for Best Actress. Helen Hunt (""As Good As it Gets"") over Kate, please. Gloria Stuart (""The Invisible Man""), Billy Zane (""Dead Calm""), Frances Fisher (""Unforgiven""), Kathy Bates (""Misery""), Bill Paxton (""Twister""), Victor Garber (TV's ""Alias""), and Eric Braedon (TV's ""The Young and the Restless"") co-star.

I don't think I've ever liked Billy Zane after this movie. His character is evil, conniving, ruthless and just plain clueless. I think one of the most exciting parts of this movie is when Rose is looking for Jack after he is taken to the room and handcuffed to the pipe in the Criminals' Passage. I love it when she pushes the guy into the elevator and forces him to go down to E Deck. The entire scene after Rose finds Jack is amazing as well, all of the water and special effects are incredible... Makes you think what you would do in that situation. Rose knows that there is a good chance she may never find Jack and die in the process, but shes determined anyway. So emotional !! I think this movie is outstanding and will go down in history as one of the greatest movies of all time, just as Titanic has gone down in history as one of the greatest mysteries and tragedies of all time.",Titanic

The special effects and Kate Winslet look great in the movie. While we're on the subject, Leonardo DiCapprio is someone else who is overrated. He's....OK. He was very good in ""The Basketball Diaries"", and he was decent in ""The Aviator"" and ""The Beach"". I was NOT impressed, however (unlike most people), with his performance in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"". He didn't play a mentally handicapped kid -- he played a ""retard"".

1721,Miyumi,A very good epic movie,10,29 November 2005,"Titanic is probably one of the best movies I've seen. Or maybe it could be the BEST one ever.Plot - Rose(Kate Winslet) goes aboard the Titanic to go to United States of America for her wedding with Cal(Billy Zane). Aboard the enormous Titanic, she meets a young man named Jack(Leonardo DiCaprio) who changes her whole way of life and they end up falling for each other. But unfortunately, their time didn't last long. Rose's parents tried to separate the two lovebirds, and along with that, the Titanic hits the iceberg, and the ship sinks. What happened was that Rose's parents thought of separating them by setting Jack up. They made Rose think that Jack stole the Heart of the Ocean jewel necklace that Cal gave to Rose. Soon, Rose realizes that Jack didn't steal the necklace and hurried up to rescue him from his prison. Afterwards, they were running, swimming and dashing for their lives as the Titanic's decks and rooms fill up with cold icy waters of the Atlantic ocean. In the end of the movie, Jack dies and Rose lives. Rose did everything that jack told her to do in her life, then one night, Rose was reunited with her true love.This plot is truly amazing. Not only it shows how the people aboard the Titanic had panicked, died and fled, it also shows a heart-warming story of love.Music - The music of Titanic is truly amazing. The music was perfect for each setting of the movie. Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"" is perfectly amazing. I still listen to it! Characters - Well, all I could say is that the characters of the movie(or if you would prefer the actors and actresses...) were very good. Leonardo acts very well for Jack and as do Kate Winslet for her character.This movie is truly amazing. That's all I could say. This is James Cameron at his very best yet! The Titanic and all the effects looks really realistic. Everything is amazing. This is a must-see movie! ^^",Titanic
1722,dustinlawrence,Great film. over hype,9,12 December 2005,"It is unfortunate, but I believe this film was over hyped and therefore received some extreme levels of criticism. Additionally, it didn't help that when the movie was being marketed for VHS, it was deemed ""the best movie of all time"". Out of all of the 200 million dollar movies made, I believe this one beats out LOTR. I think this movie was able to capture a wider audience (yes, the demographics did shift towards the 18 years or younger females), but this is a movie you can watch with your grandma or your little sister. Historical accuracy was pretty good with a little bit of Hollywood (murdoch shooting people and himself, as debated by his relatives).

The parts that I would have kept are the beginning, Kate Winslets suicide attempt, her nude scene and the sinking. All the rest was completely unnecessary. I didn't understand two things. Why didn't DiCaprio get on the door with Winslet, and why did she toss the 30 million dollar diamond over board in the end. Like the words of Jim Carrey (to Winslet ""Why did you let Leo DiCaprio drown while you were safe on the big door? Would you have taken turns or were you just afraid to freeze your fat ass off.""I knew there was going to be a love story, but it was a bit cheesy. I personally favot the love story in Pearl Harbor.

1730,superfly,"Good Movie, but. . .",10,27 December 1998,"Okay, it was a great movie, one of the best I've ever seen. I thought the plot was well done, I thought the special effects and the detail of everything was amazing, and I thought the movie did a phenomenal job of developing some other characters (i.e. the string quartet during the sinking) if only for their fifteen minutes of fame. Everything made it a full experience, and I felt it was worth the five bucks to see it. In fact, I went to see it a second time. The only weak part was that the ending took about two minutes too long, but that's a minor point.It was a great movie, but please, the boat sank, get over it.",Titanic
1731,KNWO,Best Movie of all time,10,24 February 1999,Titanic is in my opinion the best movie of all time. 30 years from now it will be a classic like Gone With the Wind. I think the Academy Awards people were right in giving it 11 awards including best picture. And that's the bottom line cause I said so.,Titanic
1732,Luke-18,"it was the best of films, it was the worst of films...",5,6 February 1999,"I have heard people herald this as the work of genius.  I have heard just as many people declare it the work of the anti-christ.  I, myself, spent some time (most intensely, I might add, around the time of the Academy Awards) in the latter group.  Now that I have had time to step back and organize my opinions objectively, I can no longer claim that ""Titanic"" is the worst movie in history.  Though there are a number of places where the dialogue is unforgivable, and the performances of DiCaprio and Zane are downright laughable, I must admit that the cinematography is superb, as are the directing and the special effects.  I find it horrible that the lives of some 1100 people or so are trivialized by focusing on the clichéd love story between the two lead.  I can't, however, in clear conscience, continue to condemn this movie as I have in the past.  Glistening amongst the arrid wasteland of poor dialogue are gems of writing (though most of them are factual occurrences that not even James Cameron would dare claim to be his ideas) and visual communication.  ""Titanic"" is a film of superlative nature, both the best and the worst.  No movie in history has been so polarized as this.  There is no room for mediocrity in this self-indulgent epic.",Titanic

DUH.. their SOO obvious.. they bored me to death.. thankful I just got re-incarnated..I can understand that some people, especially those who don't watch that many movies, that they like a movie like this. A lot of people like soaps, and cheap supermarket novels as well. Any why ? Because you know what it means, what it means for you, you get a grip on it and that feels safe, comforting. But it really has no point watching such a movie, or reading such a book other than just to comfort your mind, as if you were listening to silence.. the only thing on earth that comes close as to how predictable Titanic and the above named junk is. But if you want to use your mind, opinions, personality and perception, try reading real literature and watch real movies like: FoxFire, U-Turn, Nowhere, The Crow, Strange Days (all surrealism I think) .. or .. (more serieus movies) Good Will Hunting, 12 Angry Men .. or .. (more adventurous and/or funny movies) Pulp Fiction, Freeway, From Dusk till Down, Clerks ..",Titanic

The movie has a deep and powerful center to it that cannot be accurately described in words.  All I can say, is that I felt like it was more like an experience than just a movie.  You almost felt as if you were on the Titanic.  Everything about the movie is awesome from the soundtrack to the special effects.  James Cameron is a great director and I would like to thank him for making such an amazing film.",Titanic
1736,Teme,The most powerful human drama ever made,10,5 March 1999,"The Titanic disaster has been a subject of several movies and books, but yet Jim Cameron's epic masterpiece TITANIC exceeds the greatest expectations. It is the most powerful human drama ever since Gone With the Wind, and it has became the most celebrated movie in the history. The cast, the sets, the wardrobe, and finally the events that lead to tragedy, have captured the hearts of millions around the world.The sets and scenes are made with as much accuracy to detail as possible, no liberties to sets and scenes are made. All the possible details have been included, both constructional and historical details. The filming crew took as few liberties with the accepted history as possible.The 775-feet Titanic set they built for the movie was described by Ken Marschall, one of the leading Titanic historians of present day later described it ""I still can't think of it as a movie set. Today I still call it the Titanic"" (Titanic: Breaking New Ground)James Cameron's TITANIC is without a doubt the most accurate version of the ship, the people, and the events that took place on the North Atlantic, in a cold April night in 1912.",Titanic

I also am happy he won best picture, as he's one of my favorite directors; I'm also happy James Horner won for the score. However, the plot was pretty mundane, and the acting was merely OK. All in all, not something I'd pay money to see again. By the way, did anyone else notice the tattoo of a cross on Kate Winslet's arm? A little out of the ordinary for a woman of 1912, wouldn't you think?",Titanic
1738,kasandra,amazing,10,16 November 1998,I loved this movie it was moving and caused me to sob at this unnecessary tragedy's occureence.I thought that both Leo and Kate were amazing and portrayed the characters not only efficiently but to the point where you have to remind yourself that it is just a movie.I truly enjoyed it and agree with many writers when they say that all girls wish it was them kissing Jack because I too wish it was me kissing him maybe not on the Titanic though.,Titanic
1739,Meledeo,Great direction,8,30 July 1998,"Titanic was an excellent film, but definitely not because of anything Leo or Kate did.  They, in my opinion, were just crowd attraction techniques. They could have used anyone for these roles and the movie would have been improved/worsened only slightly.  The real reason this movie was excellent was because of Jim Cameron's undying devotion to the project's perfection.  He did countless retakes of key scenes, got behind the camera himself many times, and made sure every part of the movie matched the picture in his mind.  He even drew the portraits himself!  If all directors would put this much into their films, there would be no shortage of quality films, as there have been in past years.",Titanic
1740,Roon,A big waste of money.,1,23 November 1998,"When I first heard, that James Cameron was going to make a film about Titanic, I had big expectations. I thought that it was going to be a movie that would stun me. Sadly it was a big disappointment. The movie never interested me, I was bored and never stunned by the special effects. The sinking of Titanic was a disaster and Cameron never gave me the impression that it was a disaster. I never saw real emotions, it all came down on overacting and commercial emotions. I guess for someone who doesn't see as many movies as I do, Titanic will be a great movie. The movie never worked up to its expections and it never showed why it had cost so much money. I think most people love the film because the commercials told them it was the greatest movie ever. Also the acting of both main characters was below every expectation, this is proven by the fact that none of them won an Acadamy award.",Titanic
1741,GRENDEL-20,Mixed emotions...,6,17 December 1998,"Well... of course I saw the movie on the opening weekend, and I guess I was kinda way to psyched-up, because the flick didn't really live up to my expectations. Hey, it was BIG - and I mean REALLY BIG - beautifully shot, great special effects, fine actors (first time I saw Leonardo, and he was actually okay!) and a really over the top budget... Just too bad the story sucked big-time. I mean, there was absolutely nothing new! It was just one big rewrite of films already shot a hundred times. That's kinda too bad. Well........",Titanic

If the Titanic didn't really sink, everyone would see how poor an attempt at a film this is.  The script is laughable. It is obvious that much more time went into the authenticity of the cutlery and so on than the characters.  James Cameron did not deserve an award for this.",Titanic
1743,RootBoy,Stare at a blank wall for 3+ hours. Better use of your time.,1,25 January 1999,"While I will admit that the special effects were pretty good (they better be for $280 million) the rest of the movie was absolutely horrible.  The most believable performance in the film was by the Iceberg.  The characters were entirely plastic, and I felt no sympathy for any of them when they died.We have Selfish Brat Rose, who decides that she is going to get what she wants no matter what her parents say. She even laughs when her much older self tells of her Fiance's suicide. She changes her name and allows her mother to think she is dead; not a word of hope for the poor mother of Rose. Not to mention that despite its size, she must have the ENTIRE board to herself when she and Jack are in the water.  Whatever happened to ""you jump I jump?""  Wouldn't they have been able to keep warmer if they had been huddled together?  It seems she forgot to mention this 2 day incident of true love to her eventual husband of some 80 odd years too. Hmmm....Then we have Over-glorified-Representation-of-Freedom Jack, a ""gentleman"" who doesn't bother to s**** Rose in the bedroom when she is naked, but waits until they are in the backseat of a car (now isn't THAT romantic!). Wouldn't a true ""gentleman"" (especialy one of that era) not have done anything at all?  Great job of accurately representing the time period, James...The acting was indeed bad, but I cannot entirely blame the Actors for this. It is hard to make stupid one-liners (such as ""this is bad"" when the ship is vertical) sound good, and kudos to Cappy for trying.The success of this movie at the box office is not too hard to understand. I know at least 7 people who saw it 5 or more times each, and have heard of others who have seen it more, but how anyone at the academy could have thought it deserved any NOMINATIONS other than perhaps Best effects is beyond me.",Titanic

1745,jd-43,A Titanic disappointment,4,16 March 1999,"I have seen ""Titanic"" twice.  From the beginning, it has promise, but the promise fades away when the upper-class passengers are all depicted as cold-hearted, selfish villains with little or no humanity at all.  The ""villains"" are too cartoonish to be real, much less entertaining.  Especially in the cases of ""Cal"" and ""Mr. Lovejoy"", who are even psychopathic!  We know right off that the girl's fiancee is someone to root against because 1) she has to end up with Leo, so she cannot be allowed to desire this man; 2) he is arrogant enough to put half of Hollywood to shame; 3) with his lines ""God himself could not sink this ship"" and ""Picasso: he won't amount to anything; trust me, he won't"" we know that he is an idiot, and a waste of her time.  The special effects were outstanding, but I can't help thinking that if only the movie had depended more on good writing than the hearthrob factor, that it would have been a much better movie.",Titanic

However, there are many many downfalls that made me comment.Firstly, I would love to just say ""sucks"" and leave it at that but that would be rude.   A predictable plot and acting is in question.  I still have not seen the film but I will never watch it because of this.  The astronomical budget did not meet the end result.  Comparing this to Ben Hur which has won the most awards from the academy would make this film look like ""showgirls"" to star wars.I do believe the film did deserve some credit for special fx but the budget of several hundred million dollars could have fed Millions of starving children in Ethiopia for several months..",Titanic

But that after some time (3 months) I got a free ticket for a small cinema matinee. So I said screw it, let's see it. At the start it was OK but than soap opera started. Man, how can you stand to hear that BS all the time ?? Leo is dying, so what and he's doing it at least 30 minutes. And three hours long film, please ! The movie made for the little teenage girls, who go to cinema just to see the Di Crapio. The only good thing in the movie are the scenes, which are really cool made.",Titanic

Usually, with big budget eyeball movies, nothing much is top notch outside of the special effects.  But personally, from the moment that Rose Dewitt-Bukater steps out of her car, she captivates all eyes in the audience.  She is the movie star of her time, and she was robbed of the Best Actress Oscar.  All of the other actors around her shine also, including Billy Zane, who is an amazing villain, Frances Fisher, Leonardo DiCaprio, and all of the other wonderful actors in this film, give the greatest performances for a film full of love, passion, and heartache.  This is the only flawless film I have ever seen.  I was unable to move from my seat after this journey, and that doesn't happen often. Titanic is a 10, Kate Winslet is a star, and the movie has won my heart.",Titanic
1749,BettiM,great movie with 63 suspenseful minutes,10,24 April 1999,"First of all, I am a girl, but I don't like this movie because of Leonardo DiCaprio. I think he was quite okay, but anyone else could have played his role - and better. That's the only thing that bothers me about ""Titanic"". Kate Winslet was great as ""Poor Little Rich Girl"" Rose, and also Billy Zane as ""unimaginable bastard"" Cal. The huge ship is just fantastic, its luxury amazing.I just loved romantic scenes like ""I'm flying"" with that breathtaking sunset. But what fascinated me most were the 63 minutes of the sinking: Titanic sinking faster and faster, panic rising and rising, more and more people trying to escape from death but drowning of being sucked back into the ship and more and more things getting destroyed - these aspects made the Titanic's sinking the movie's most breathtaking, suspenseful and moving minutes. That's the best about the movie to me.For me Kate Winslet is a great actress not only for her good acting, but also for her patience and perseverance to hold out. I suppose it must have been hard to do the sinking scenes, as I read that Kate once almost drowned.I've seen ""Titanic"" six times yet, and every time the Titanic's sinking was as suspenseful and moving to me like seeing it for the first time. I can almost feel the cold water and the sheer terror those people feel, and that makes me want to cry each time, also the romantic ""My Heart Will Go On"". When I saw ""Titanic"" for the first time I cried when the ship broke apart. Now only the beautiful song makes me cry.Although three hours make ""Titanic"" almost too long, it's a great movie, which I like to watch again and again. I don't like Leonardo, but I love that movie!Vote: 10",Titanic
1750,Carton,"When the boat hits the iceberg, you pray this time it won't go down.",8,12 February 1999,"This movie is good.  It is a love story that has you rooting for Jack and Rose against the odds.  It redeems even Cal in the lifebost scene. The special effects are stirring and the way Cameron uses the past and present to tell the story gives the viewer a complete picture of Rose.  When we see the pictures of Rose as she grows older, especially riding the horse in front of the roller coaster, you realize what Jack has done for her.  She has been set free to live and not exist.  This movie deserved the Oscar and I'm glad it won.",Titanic
1751,erg,What an awful movie!,1,22 June 1999,"SO much hype. The acting was just terrible. People flocked to this movie like sheep. The dialogue was so contrived, how could people not notice? It is a shame this movie is seen as ""romantic"", rather than as the monstrosity it is.",Titanic
1752,Shoebox,Maybe...if only the technical stuff counts.,6,8 April 1999,"For a long time, I hated this movie.  The drawn out scenes, the ridiculous plot line, the horrible script, the melodramatic acting, and to top it all off, an annoying ballad to accompany this poor excuse for a feature film. Nevertheless, this movie enthralled some moviegoers to sit through it four of five times.  Could I have been that wrong about the biggest box office hit in history?The answer is no.  Although I have seen the movie for a second time and now more clearly realize how remarkable the visual effects truly are, I can't let go of everything else.Kate Winslet actually received an Oscar nomination for her flat, uninteresting portrayal of Rose and people were really upset that she lost? I find this hard to believe considering that Winslet came off in this film like she ordered her SAG card off of the Home Shopping Network.  Also, her pairing with DiCaprio was as odd as Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggie, only without the on-screen chemistry of the famous puppets.The two interesting characters in this whole shipwreck,  didn't even receive the recognition they deserved in my opinion.  Billy Zane and Kathy Bates were the only people keeping me awake and they were ignored while Gloria Stuart received a nomination for playing a role my grandmother could have better demonstrated.Best Picture?  I think not.  However, Titanic does deserve every award it has received for visual effects and art direction.  I'm also willing to agree with the Academy in choosing James Cameron as Best Director. Nonetheless, this movie does not have the ingredients to be considered the Best Picture of 1997 let alone of all time.  Perhaps if I watch it a third time?  I doubt it.  6 out of 10.",Titanic

1754,G-33,Decent,6,23 April 1999,"This movie had lots of potential, but because of poor acting jobs (with the exception of Cathy Bates) it was only decent. It is worth seeing but it will probably not be your favorite movie unless you find it so romantic that it rules out the bad acting.",Titanic
1755,flashman-6,Titanic should have been called something else,3,30 April 1999,"It is always the way in Hollywood these days, Why let history get in the way of a blockbuster movie. Titanic has plenty of good points about it, but any student of the disaster could not help but be disappointed. Especially with the glaring inaccuracies and cliches this movie had to offer.The American's brash and almost looking like they knew the damn ship would sink.The British, stiff and emotionless in first class who would given the chance be quite happy to shoot the Irish peasants on the lower decks if the were allowed.The British lower classes were a bunch of thugs.The Poor Irish as a load of Guinness swigging biddly biddly dancing bumpkins, clearly the victims in the disaster.The point I am try to make is that the tragedy of 1912 was a multilayered affair, with moments of great sadness and bravery throught the two plus hours of the ships sinking. I feel that James Cameron had sacrificed this for the love story of Rose and Jack which is a shame.I did enjoy Titanic but I thought it was a missed opportunity to show what happened. For my money a far more moving film about the sinking of the Titanic was ""A Night To Remember"" with Kenneth More and Honor Blackman amongst others.The Titanic story is a deeply emotion subject I would truly recommend A Night To Remember if you want to watch a film about the sinking of the Titanic and watch Titanic if you want to watch a Love Story.",Titanic
1756,bloop,What is wrong with you people?,10,26 May 1999,"First of all, I'm a guy and Titanic was not even close to the worst waste I've seen in my life.  Granted, L.A. Confidential in particular was totally robbed of the awards it should have gotten (if the Oscars aren't so discredited by now, it should be disassembled anyway), but what you have is a pretty decent movie.First of all, some say Leo can't act.  Well, he can, but he wasn't handed much of a script for this one.Secondly, the romantic story has been done before, and better, in some Disney movies (Pauper marries the Princess-type stories).There is a lot to say in its credit.  The message is very anti-materialistic, something the U.S. desperately needs.  The FX and detail that went into the sinking of the ship was also very good.  It seems like those that totally oppose this movie are doing it for one and only one reason, ""Star Wars"".  I like ""Star Wars"" more than Titanic, but in the end both movies were VERY successful in their times so what's with the bitterness?  Also, if you consider the ""Star Wars"" films as being one (since they are continuous), then it kicks the tar out of any movie ever made. So enough of the bad blood between SW fans and Titanic fans.  They are both good movies totally unlike each other.  Titanic gets 3 and 1/2 bloops (outof four).",Titanic
1757,fluff-7,Brilliant Movie,9,9 June 1999,"While the story was predictable.  What better way to take us all over the ship.  We saw how the rich lived aboard the ship right down to the poor. We saw how the poor were treated horribly by being locked in.  Even though it was acting we could get an  idea of how frightening it must have been for the victims of this tragedy.  So I feel that this movie accomplished what it set out to do . Sure sometimes it becomes cliche.  But in the end we learned how people thought in that time.  And most importantly the mistakes that were made that contributed to this tragedy, that are not allowed to be made today",Titanic

Now he could have done this in a variety of ways, A load of speculation, facts and figures dates and times (boring) or he could have followed the documented facts to the letter. (Ship left Southampton, got to the middle of the Atlantic, hit an iceberg, not enough boats, people died. the end) also boring.By using the love story of Jack and Rose and by making us take them to our hearts. The loss that we feel for all those hundreds of people is enormous.This isn't just a movie about  sinking ship, or a movie about a rich girl and a poor guy who get it on. It is a true slice of history that is known about and now thanks to James Cameron, Kate Winslet, Leo DiCaprio,Kathy Bates and all the others it is History we care deeply about.So next time you watch it, Don't think about the SFX or the love story or the sinking ship, think about what it gets across to you and makes you feel for all those people that died.in the real Titanic disaster.",Titanic

1760,sparklex,Rating of 8,8,23 June 1999,"So there's a love story and the ship sinks.  We know that.  What James Cameron has given us is visuality, a chance to feel sorry for those doomed, and an average, every day affair.  So the affair wasn't as brilliant as I expected it to be.  I wish there was some more to it, some more twist. But the visuals- no one can say that was done wrong.  Cameron did an excellent job of making this saddening story come to life.  The ship sunk.  That's how we read it.  What he gave us was this: The huge, claimed as ""unsinkable"" ship was on it's way plummeting down towards the sea, where death to over a thousand passengers and crew members awaited them.  The ship took a plunge down into the sea. The passengers who had already dived into the sea, were either looking with astonishment, or fighting for their lives in horror.All in all, though, this was superbly done, and deserved all of the hype it got. -Sparkle :)",Titanic

But if there wasn't a lot of hype, I bet trillions MORE people would love this movie.  It was a record of history.  If they make a movie about Amelia Earhart or The Kennedys, I wonder if people will be as inconsiderate as the did of the R.M.S. Titanic.  I loved the movie. Every time I saw it I cried.  The couple behind me were hitting me on the head trying to shut me up.  I couldn't help it.  Now I must admit.  I am a Leo fan.  And I mean an obsessed fan.  You should see my room-DANG!  Anyway, I think Leo is the best actor around.  Don't start to label me as another TEENYBOPPER.  He's had some rough spots (like Critters 3) but he's come a long way.

1764,Yodagirl-2,Titanic: A disaster indeed.,1,13 August 1999,"While the popular thing to do would be to simply say, this movie sucks, without any particular reasons why, I won't. The reason why it drew so much attention was mostly because rabid, drooling females saw that Leonardo DiCaprio was in it.  While he may not be a bad actor at all, to rate a movie as very high, simply because one of the actors is very ""hot"" is extremely stupid indeed.  While the plot wasn't that bad, the problem was that everyone knew the outcome...the ship was going to sink and a bunch of people were going to die.  In cutting off this suspense from the viewers, the effectiveness of the film was partially destroyed.Another thing that bothered me was how the rich passengers (exceptions being Rose and Molly Brown) were all portrayed as uncaring, selfish, materialistic beings...apparently only  because they were wealthy.  This is an extremely biased and 2-D cardboard point of view.  In fact, the whole movie seemed very 2 dimensional and an insult to the real tragedy that occured.  It incured sympathy for them, but characters were often displayed as only good or only bad.  Humans are made up of both sides, and in this movie, the characters were either entirely noble, or entirely nasty.  It was given an Oscar for best picture, in my opinion, purely because it was one of the latest movies to come out and everyone was raving over it.  Fortunately, however, as Titanic's only following were fickle teenagers (my age group) who jump onto every new movie that comes along with cheers, proclaiming themselves ultimate fans, Titanic will soon disappear into oblivion.  Star Wars, although NOT winning an Oscar for best picture, triumphs in the end, for it has kept a large following for a good 25 years.  Titanic seems to be fading away after 2.",Titanic

The special effects were spectacular but the death of 1500 people seemed incidental behind DiCaprio and Winslett's rather corny romance. Aristocrat girl, betrothed to the villain you love to hate, falls for the street-wise tramp (who looks years her junior.)At least the producers got their facts straight and depicted the sinking accurately, but I can't see this film ageing gracefully when in years to come the 90's special effects lose their impact and our kids mock the mid-90's hairstyle DiCaprio sports in this film.",Titanic

1767,RuffRydr,A little overrated,5,10 October 1999,I believe that Titanic was overrated and should not be one of the greatest films of all time. I will say it is a good film but the poor dialogue and the hackneyed story seems a little boring. Why did the movie win so many Oscars? It was the lack of quality movies that year. There are many reasons Titanic didnt make the Top 250 among the voters.  The movie also showed a lot of nudity for a PG-13 film and Winslet shouldn't be showing her stuff.,Titanic
1768,Suellen-2,What a fantastic film!,10,23 October 1999,"Before I saw Titanic, I wasn't aware how this movie would affect me, but it sure was a movie I just couldn't see once - I saw it 9 times in the cinema! The thought that this event actually did happen was also something that makes it even more amazing. James Cameron is a genius! He has totally captured the whole event in a way that so many people have related to. For people to say that this movie is no good is to say that they weren't watching it! The way James Cameron has included Jack and Rose with actual people who were on the Titanic is very well done and the fact that they used such a fantastic cast and movie set only adds to the reasons why this movie will always be regarded as a classic. I give it ten out of ten!",Titanic

I'm not the kind of guy that likes to pick a fight like every other man does, I got emotions, too. The first time I saw ""Titanic"", it seemed to pass by really fast. Sure, I admit, it's a long movie, but it felt like a ten minute cartoon. Before I knew it, it was over. What I'm trying to say is: Don't pass this one up. If you look into this movie very closely, you will see what I mean. I'm surprised ""Titanic"" isn't in the top 250 movies.",Titanic
1770,layyla,"Forget the Negative Backlash, See It Again and Think For Yourself",10,10 July 2001,"When Titanic premiered in 1997 I remember my first reaction to it. I was very moved and couldn't remember ever seeing a film on it's scale. After a bit it seemed everyone agreed with me and I watched as it broke box office records and took the Academy Awards by storm. Then something interesting happened. Very quickly it became fashionable to dislike the film. The backlash became very strong. I have talked to people who bragged that they never stooped so low as to actually see Titanic. Were the box office receipts just hype? Did the Academy Awards bow to the pressure of the money the film earned? That seems to the the current opinion. No one wants to admit to ever having liked the film.Recently I watched Titanic again on DVD. I watched it alone so that no one else's reaction would infringe on me. My final reaction is simple. I loved it. I loved it just as I did the first time I saw it. Everything about the film holds up just as it always did. My final opinion is that people who brag about not liking it are bowing to the pressure of negative backlash. Watch it again, see what you think (not what your friends think), and decide what you think. I think you'll agree with me.",Titanic
1771,mikequis,Not worth waiting for!!!,1,9 April 2000,I have waited three years to see this movie and finally obtained a video for £2.  I'm glad I didn't invest more.  The acting from the leading pair is as awful as it can get.  The script is absolutely horrific.  Effects and music earn accolades as do some of the supporting cast.  The mystery is why was this film so big a blockbuster?  Maybe with proper actors......,Titanic
1772,SneakyJoker,Titanic: An Incredible Experience,10,30 December 1999,"James Cameron's ""Titanic"", is quite simply one of the greatest films ever made. The intricate love story, set on board one of the 20th century's worst disasters, was superb. The score, the visuals, the special effects, the acting, etc.....all combined to make this film the phenomenal achievement that it is. This film pulls you back in time to 1912, on board the famous ship with its doomed passengers. You come to feel close to Jack and Rose, all the while aware that certain doom is just ahead of them. The film is sobering and fittingly emotional, as too many lost their lives. Husbands and wives torn apart forever, as were large and small families, and of course...Jack and Rose. At least until the end, when Rose finally passes away and returns to Jack...on board Titanic. ""Titanic"" is absolutely spellbinding, engrossing, and an incredible film experience. A definite 10.",Titanic

1775,DaisyDarling,A movie worth viewing,10,31 May 2000,"This may sound incredibly lame or sappy, but I had never seen a movie that made me cry for a week afterwards until Titanic.  Now don't get me wrong; I am a very emotional person, and this story just hit me.  I believe that was James Cameron's intent when he wrote it.  He knew just what to write, and when and how to write it.The movie had it's flaws, yes.  I incredibly disliked the story with older Rose and believed that it would add to the suspense, surprise and story if it had just started out back in 1912 and was just the disaster story, and not the whole other story.  The old Rose part is pointless and just an extra half-hour to fast forward through.  Someone did make a good point in an earlier comment also, about the fact that old Rose is narrating the story, yet she manages to know all about other things that had nothing to do with her or things that came as a surprise to her.However flawed the movie is, however, it makes up for it with it's effect. Many people criticize the love story, but I believe that it was needed in order for the viewer to actually *get* the movie.  By knowing the ship was doomed, we knew the characters were doomed, and it forced the feeling of wanting them to survive by any means.  Call me sensitive, but I felt for Jack and Rose and pulled for them the entire time.Now, three years later, sometimes I will sit down to watch the epic (after fast forwarding the first half-hour).  Some parts I now find cheesy or boring, but it could be due to the fact that I've seen the movie so many times.  I definitely believe the movie deserved the Oscars it won.  It may be flawed or hated, but the Titanic phenomenon hit people like no other movie has done before.  It was a gamble by Cameron, and it won.  Those who truly appreciate it enjoy it, and those who can't see past Leo or computer effects (and believe me, Star Wars has those effects, too) just aren't as lucky as those of us who can and have and are able to truly enjoy the movie.An epic of Titanic proportions, and worthy of my appreciation.",Titanic
1776,airborne monkey,I want my $4.50 back...NOW!,1,17 July 2000,"As much as I wish I could hide the fact that I saw this...thing...that passed for a movie, I just can't.  Titanic proved that James Cameron should never try a movie with depth or plot, or a good script, because this effort failed miserably.  It will be a cold day in hell before I EVER admit this movie deserved any of the Academy Awards it got, especially considering it's competition.  L.A. Confidential-one of the best movies ever.  Good Will Hunting-an excellent movie.  As Good As It Gets-very funny and well written. Titanic-a boat.  The awards it got are the reasons that I no longer respect the Academy of Motion Picture Arts And Sciences.  Anyone who thinks that the lead actors in this movie were good, well, all I can say is, especially if you're a guy, I feel sorry for you.  An un-original story, poor poorly acted, and far beyond any reasonable budget, the success of this movie really is beyond me.  I don't think it would hurt Mr. James 'I'm King Of the World' Cameron to refund my matinee ticket price.",Titanic

SIMPLY THE BEST.",Titanic
1778,Davide Garassino,What I think about this movie.,7,2 July 2000,"I saw Titanic last night for the first time. Before watching it, I believed it was only a over hyped film for stupid girls who love DiCaprio's smart face. But...It's not so at all...I think Titanic is a very pleasant film, well directed, technically perfect, touching but not pathetic. Ok, the plot isn't original and it is a bit stereotyped( the old story of a poor guy who falls in love with an aristocratic girl ) , DiCaprio was really better inspired in Romeo+Juliet than in this film and , of course , Titanic is NOT the greatest movie ever appeared but , however , it deserves to be seen without prejudices(at least to enjoy all the marvellous digital effects).",Titanic
1779,jason.c.haitkin,OVER-RATED!!!,1,7 October 2001,"This is by far, the most over-rated movie of all time. It won something like 13 Academy Awards simply based on box office grosses. How do I know this, because it came out the same year as LA Confidential, one of the greatest crime dramas ever made. The set design and direction of Titanic are actually very good. Well the set design is AMAZING. However the acting is so bad, it makes me wonder how Leonardo Dicaprio was ever a good actor(The Basketball Diaries, What's Eating Gilbert Grape). Kate Winslet wasn't bad, but surely over-rated. Billy Zane plays a cartoon villain very poorly, not that he ever proved he was a good actor(The Phantom?). And the rest of the cast is just blah. I still can't get past the fact that people really believe this is one of the great ones. Maybe after the teeny boppers that gave this movie 614 billion dollars grow up and see more movies, they'll realize that this is an overall mediocre movie.",Titanic
1780,hopping_hessian,This is the most disgusting movie ever made.,1,2 December 2000,"I HATE this movie. It was badly scripted, badly acted, and very boring. If it was just any other chick flick I would roll my eyes and ignore it, but because Cameron used a historical backdrop, I can't help but notice it. Cameron said he made up his done to death Romeo and Juliet story line so that people would have a ""human conection"" to the ship. There were more than 2000 human conections on the ship that he just ignored. Those were stories of real people whose lives were forever affected by this ship. I think that it's sick to use the deaths of more then 1500 men, women, and children just to make money.",Titanic
1781,mikebyard,An Appreciation,10,4 July 2002,"As a Maritime Historian by choice and having been formerly involved with the BIG ships,  the traditional passenger liners for nearly 30 years, I found James Cameron's handling of, and mixing, fact and fiction extremely good and an excellent way to bring to people's notice what it must have been like on that cold night in 1912.The idea of using a fictional story of two young people on the edge of adulthood to show the optimism then dispair was a master stroke. Whilst people may snear at the storyline with Rose and Jack, the fact that this was seamlessly integrated into the story was impressive. In my shipping life I have known bigger liners than Titanic, but in her day she was as big in the national conciousness as the RMS Queen Mary or RMS Queen Elizabeth was to those of the mid 1930-60s. If one takes the view that the film, as named, was about the all too brief life of a great and majestic ship, and, as I believe Cameron himself said, putting two young people into the story as a love story and making them face the harsh realities of life should make people experience the horror of that night so long ago.Full marks to all that were involved in and around the film, and remember those whose ship of dreams took them to their death and to the death of what should have been a great ship.(as indeed her sister ship Olympic proved for nearly 20 years.)",Titanic
1782,pannkukm-2,"Two Films in One: one good, the other not",4,2 June 2003,"Warning: Some spoilers here, just in case if you haven't seen the movie in the past six years (except the iceberg, of course)
This movie, in my opinion, consisted of two different films.  The first was a contrived love story that was clearly created by someone who doesn't have a clue about how people fall in love.  I didn't buy the love story between DiCaprio's and Winslet's characters.  It seemed to me like, ""we love each other but it can't work out because we're from different sides of the tracks, so lets just have sex and make the most of it while the cruise lasts because when it ends, I'm marrying for money.""  Maybe something like that could happen, but I doubt it.  Of course, the ship hits the iceberg (NO SPOILER HERE)and that's when the second film starts up.  This is where James Cameron is in his element: action.  Characters that I couldn't possibly care less about before the iceberg hit all the sudden began acting like real people.  The only characters I did care about from beginning to end was Kathy Bates' character(a true credit to her talent), and, strangely enough, Billy Zane's character.  I hate to say it, but I was glad his character survived the sinking (the manner in which he does it defined his character more than anything earlier in the movie.) In my opinion, James Cameron wanted to make a film about the sinking of the Titanic, but sold out to the almighty dollar and, pardon the pun, sank an otherwise good idea by a terrible love story in order to cover the young female demographic.  You want to know why Cameron was so happy at the Oscars when it won best picture, because he couldn't believe the Academy bought it hook, line and sinker.  It just goes to show you that every once in a while the cream (LA Confidential, in this case) sometimes gets bogged down at the top by the crud.",Titanic
1783,toansiok,Perhaps the most overrated movie in history,1,8 January 2001,"Perhaps my expectations ran too high when I watched this movie, but I'm rather inclined to think that this is the most overrated movie that's ever been made. Although the historical facts are of course known, the story holds no surprises at all and the characters are full of clichés which makes it really hard to watch the whole movie without being lulled to sleep or bored to death. Of course, it's a very emotional film with a romantic love story, but the lovers stay two-dimensional unless you happen to be a true Leonardo-di-Caprio-fan, and as I haven't been one before, I certainly won't be one now. As to the ship's sinking itself, which is what the average viewer might have paid for to watch, it's probably impressive and satisfying for most viewers, but I think it is reaching our lowest instincts by satisfying our greed to watch catastrophes from a safe distance, e.g. your living-room or local theater, and gladness it's not us who are fighting for life. Unfortunately, there's really no more than that to the film, so if you haven't seen the movie before, keep your money and find something worth while doing.",Titanic
1784,squallseedre4,"Too light and entertaining to be highly rated on IMDb, but still good for those reasons",10,20 November 2006,"Titanic, when it came out, was a sensation. It still stands as a favourite for many, but is disliked by many for reasons that I can only guess are due to it's simplicity and entertainment value. The acting is all good, the plot is good (though predictable- as Titanic should be), the dialogue is passable and everything else fits into place. What are we left with? Dialogue. There aren't any iconic lines (barring the cheese-filled ""I'm the king of the world..."") or any lines with exceeding power or wit, as there frequently are in typical classic films. Alas, this movie goes beyond that. The ""my heart will go on"" melody played throughout the film is touching, to say the least, despite my untoward attitude of the Celine Dion version of the song. The two main characters come together in such a way typical of any romance movie. Jack and Rose etc and etc until they etc and then the ship sinks. Good. James Cameron takes us all along for the journey, though, and shows us light and shade in the process, which most good movies do. After all, a movie is defined by the sum of it's scenes and I can't think of a scene in this movie that detracts from it. Many add to the experience, some less so than others, but it's sum total rises above numerous other films, nonetheless.The first time I saw Titanic, I was reluctant, at best: it looked like a soggy chick flick, which I don't appreciate at all. At the video store, I had to get five movies to rent to get the special and I already had four. Standing at the end of the alphabet, I tried to see something that clicked, and considering I'd passed over Titanic many times before when left with the same choice, I might have been inclined to do so again. This time, I had no other choice ready, my dad was calling and so I grabbed it. It was the last of the five movies I watched, but (even though I can't remember any of the others) it was probably the best. I get feelings of movies before I see them- something clicks into place and I either identify with the music or a character I see in the DVD menu or the opening credits- and that happened as soon as I saw the DVD menu (don't ask me- I've got no idea why either). Historic, though modern; brutal, though beautiful; long, though quickly-passing... whatever that menu was, it did it. Thinking back, it may have been a map of the Titanic's course or something along those lines. Silly? Maybe so, but I was right. 9 out of 10.",Titanic

I know most people have a terrible tendency to mock you for enjoying it, but I don't care because the majority of the world has seen it and everyone must have cried, I mean that beautiful ship just sinking under all that water. Ah amazing! It's that whole feel good thing about a ship and the freedom it allows! It has those incredibly heroic moments, and the amazing lines that no one could forget! 'I'm flying! Jack!' 'I'm the king of the world (whoop whoop)'. The stuff that people take the Mick out of but as soon as they get onto a ship, attempt to 'fly'! It gives the sense that there is love out there for everyone, It's got a sort of modern day Romeo and Juliet sense, except not completely modern, because it was like 94 years ago but it's the feeling that you can be happy whatever cage you've been trapped in. And only the stoneist of hearts could fail to cry at this amazing, breath taking, brilliantly uplifting film, that promises love conquers all.",Titanic

At first I had no interest in seeing Titanic, but after all my friends saw it and wouldn't shut up about it I decided to see what all the fuss was about. Boy was I blown away. I have never seen a movie like it before. This is one of the few movies I have actually bought. I was completely satisfied in every way a movie goer should be satisfied. The Detail in the movie was unbelievable from the costumes, props, and set design. The music fit the movie perfectly, not one cue was out of place. All the acting was good especially from Kate Winslet and Gloria Stewart. If I had to state a negative about the movie the only thing I could possibly think of would TIME. This movie is LONG!!!

1790,robertleahy,A film that in time will be remembered as one of the greatest ever made,10,25 June 2006,It is truly regrettable that Titanic is not in the the top 250.I think this is mainly due to the fact that it was so successful.As the biggest grossing movie of all time it is a big target of those who think that nothing could deserve such commercial success.I saw it for the first time when it first came out on the big screen and 3 hours later I left the theatre literally blown away.I have sen it a few times since and my experience has been pretty much the same...i felt that i had seen a great classic.People have a problem with romance?.....Well the romantic story is the heart of this film much as it was with the all time favourite of many (none other than Casablanca)...For Me.....James Cameron achieved the impossible ....he was able to convince you that you had witnessed the sinking of that gigantic ship!..The acting (contrary to the opinions of some)was fine....have there been better acting performances on screen? sure there have been but i don't see Olivier's version of Hamlet on the top list.....For me the story telling was excellent not just in terms of the love relation between Winsett and DiCaprio but also how it adressed the notions of class distinction as well as man's arrogance as far as the forces of nature are concerned.i gave this film a 10 and am not ashamed to admit it!!!!!!!!!!!!,Titanic
1791,expro,It does not rock my boat...,2,29 November 2006,"This film really does smell of cheese. Before I describe the overpowering smell of cheese i must point out a few things... First I watched it for the first time in 2006, but maybe that only let the cheese mature. Secondly I watched it in Russia which subsequently meant that it was dubbed. But before i am attacked by fans for bothering to write an opinion about it even though i saw a dubbed version of it, which obviously spoils any movie good or bad, i have to say this time i was glad that a film was dubbed. I understood the translation and was glad to be spared hearing the ridiculous script from the actors, which could of made it unbearable but the dubbing at least made it comical.It is a typical love story that could be used in any film situation, but this time it exploited the titanic's tragedy. I am not knocking any romance films or anything and appreciate that it is an extremely popular genre. But is came across as so basic and predictable i wished it was in the hands of David Lynch or Ken Russell, to ""liven"" things up a little.The sinking of the ship was the best bit, and kind of exciting too, but with that amount of money you could probably make a film about pulling the bath plug out your bath and make it look epic. However even the actual sinking, dieing and drowning had the sugar coated Hollywood feel. Which came across in casting and acting too, but i won't even go there. Back to the cheese factor, the ICING on the cake (sorry) was the sound track. Celine Dion whatever you do and however you do it, you just stink.To rate this movie I will give it three out of ten. Why? Firstly because DiCaprio dies, nice touch. Though i do acknowledge that he is a good actor most of the time its just the films character. Secondly because Kate Winslet is so fine, with or without her clothes on. If fact her outfits though out the film are excellent. Third point goes to the absurd amount of money spent on the sinking bit which subsequently made me think for the first time about how truly horrific it must of actually been in real life, which was considerably worse than what we see in this easy to watch catastrophe. However we have to go minus a point because of the truly pathetic modern day tear jerker grandma spills her heart out bits. Boo hoo.",Titanic

1793,crocodlle,"Teeny Boopers, eh?",10,16 February 2002,"First off, I will comment on the movie.Titanic is a very (but not completely) accurtate telling of how the Titanic sank so many years ago. Rose, an early 20th century woman trapped in a world where woman didn't have many rights (not even voting!) is about to end her life before Jack stops her. Making a long (3 hour!) story short, Jack and Rose fall in love, the ship sinks, and almost 100 yrs later, Old Rose is asked to re-tell the story of Titanic.I really liked this movie. They DID have a few twists, and people said the love story was predictable, but really, would you even CALL it a love story if the characters ended up hating each other? The effects were awesome, the scenery breath-taking, the moral of human triumph over disaster clearly stated, and the plot was decent. Done before, but still decent. A must-watch movie that takes you away on a tragic voyage.Now, in refrence to those who say that this is the movie made famous by ""Teeny Boopers"":During 2001, a remake of The Planet of the Apes came out. It has made MILLIONS. It's riduculous how much money that movie made. Another movie came out that same summer. Moulin Rouge. VERY good movie. Unique, different, and while it has flaws, twenty times better that Planet of the Apes. However, it didn't make as much.So how did such a horrible movie get more money? They're called ""Young Males between the ages of 21 - 40"". They think the movie ""rocked"" and ""it was fantastic!"". But most people would agree it sucked BADLY.In 1997, Titanic came out, and guess what? Those young males (who happen to ALSO give Titanic REALLY low votes in the voting demographic)thought the movie was awful, and claim it was all because of Teeny Boopers that it was popular.The next time they blame something on Teeny Boopers, ""Young Males"" should start thinking about the HUNDREDS of movies THEY'VE made popular despite the movies being HUNDREDS of times WORSE than Titanic.My point: Apparently, ""Young Males"" have worse taste than ""Teeny Boopers"".",Titanic

It is, what it is. The film is already dated. For true romantic epics, check out ""El Cid"", or ""Dr. Zhivago"". In closing, there's more to great epics than pretty faces and special effects.

But it made a couple of mistakes, i mean they didn't have flashlights like what they have in it back in 1912. And the lights in the ship should have turned of earlier, cause they had no back up power and stuff like that then. but i think it's so sad cause you know that only a few people will live, you know that all the poor will die.

1800,lonelyhatter,Titanic,10,21 February 2007,"(Contains spoilers)Everyone predicted disaster for Titanic prior to its release. However, contrary to what people anticipated, Titanic went on to capture the hearts and imagination of the world. The immense success of Titanic resulted in many thinking Titanic is now, ""overrated"" and some have gone as far to claim Titanic is the, ""worst movie ever created"". This backlash against Titanic is primarily driven by one of two factors, jealously and many becoming tired of ""Titanic-mania"" accompanied by a desire to be different from the norm. Obviously these reasons cloud the judgment of most of its critics and I plan to set the record straight. When Titanic was released the world was in the first years of the Internet craze. Everyone was becoming desensitized to human tragedy and was wasting their lives away online. However, when Titanic was released it struck a cord with the entire planet. It reminded everyone that any day could be your last and that you must live each day to the fullest. This is primarily what captivated the hearts and minds of the entire world. Titanic was released at the very moment the world needed a reality-check. It showed us through this brilliantly crafted film that there is still a need for love and compassion and that our world is still filled with human tragedy, not just computers. For that alone, this movie must go down in history as one of the greatest movies ever created. Another primary reason why Titanic is a phenomenal film is the well-acted love story between Jack and Rose. The love story created an emotional doorway to the tragedy that occurred that night. As a viewer you began to care for the characters. Through this you felt the feelings of those who lost their lives and loved ones on this fatal shipwreck. Having these lovers come from different social classes also allowed the viewers to see the mentality of 1912 through two different perspectives. It gave the audience insight into how man thought they were above Mother Nature, how women were expected to behave and how lower classes were treated inhumanly. The love story was crucial to telling the full story of Titanic. Titanic has several others qualities that set it apart from other films. Firstly, the amazing music, which set the tone for each scene perfectly. Secondly, the outstanding cinematography that gave a variety of different angles shown in a unique fashion, which thus allowed you to feel that you were actually aboard the ship. Thirdly, the impeccable sets and costumes gave an extremely authentic feel to the movie. Fourthly, Titanic included many interesting facts throughout the film, such as not having enough lifeboats for all its passengers, increasing more speed regardless of ice warnings, telling us how many people were saved from the freezing waters and other numerous facts and figures. Finally, the ending tied everything together perfectly with Rose doing everything she promised Jack and eventually dying warm in her bed, while her soul returns to Titanic. Cameron's film was flawless for it blended past and present perfectly, while telling the story of Titanic in its entirety. This film deserves the 11 Oscars it received (including Best Picture) and achieving the worldwide position of the 3rd highest grossing film of all time (inflation included). Those who tell you Titanic is undeserving are flat out wrong. Titanic revived what was lacking in the new age of the Internet and reminded us that we must make each and every day count.",Titanic

1803,Makave1iThaDon,Highly Over-Rated,1,13 April 2001,"*WARNING SLIGHT SPOILERS* This movie was supposedly great, ""An unbelievable experience"" I heard, well of course like all other Leonardo Di Caprio movies it is boring from start to finish. The main story is peasant Jack Dawson (Leonardo Di Caprio) falling in love with Rose (Kate Winslet), who is of a much higher class. That storyline is supported by the great ship crashing into an ice-berg & doing the unthinkable, it sank on its maiden voyage! This film is poor because really in my view its just an excuse to get Leonardo Di Caprio together with yet another woman. It is one of the worst films I have ever seen, & after all the praise it got I was surprised when I saw the film. My advice is if you haven't seen the film yet don't bother you will be disappointed! My message to director James Cameron is ""The film took 3 hours and 10 minutes of my life away, and I want them back! I rate this film a very generous 2 out of 10.",Titanic

If the ship hadn't sank she would have dumped him the second they docked, or vice versa. Sickening that this is the #1 box office draw off all time. Does no one else feel ripped off by not having a more important relationship explored, or maybe it could have followed a few different relationships? Really 3 hours of crap for 1 cool shot of the guy bouncing off the rail when the boat goes down? Production value obviously there but, still a boring movie.",Titanic

1809,jhorsley,Am I alone???,7,22 June 2001,"I will start with some positive comments, the setting of the movie was definitely incredible, the final hour had some very intense moments and overall was just about enjoyable, however.....When you get past the initial razzle dazzle of the film and actually sit and think about what you just watched, it really starts hitting home how mediocre the movie really was.The script is a prime example of where the movie falls flat, to put it very bluntly it was awful. The supposed witty and funny comments, such as the comment about ""Sigmund Freud"", came across as so very tacky.The plot was just as bad as the script. Underneath the glitz was really just a very bland love story.I guess my other big gripe was the length, did it really need to be that long? Personally I don't think so. It could have cut the film a great deal, leaving a much better end result.I have to asked myself whether I'm being to critical, considering the millions(billions??) that it returned in profits.

I think that one of the brilliant things about it is that many of the lines weren't in the script, butt were developed by DiCaprio and Winslet, such as when Leo says, ""Lie on that bed, uh, I mean couch."" It was an honest mistake, but James Cameron liked it so much that he kept it. Really, it's one of my favorite lines in the movie because he loves her so much. Hint, hint.

If you are an ignorant white suburban female, you'll cream your pants for this movie because you are n ignorant white suburban female.

1817,donkeylipz,"The Titanic is totally missed in ""Titanic""",3,17 March 2010,"For all of this film's popularity, I blame the public most. Along with Avatar, Titanic shows me that audiences are less clever than they should be and fall for superficial drivel. The biggest problem about Titanic is that it isn't about Titanic at all. We could just as easily called this ""sinking ship"" or it could just as easily have taken place on the Lusitania, and the story would still have ignored the tragedy whether it was an iceberg or a U-Boat that sank the ship.What is most disappointing is the film could have been a wonderful set piece and could have produced compelling drama. For instance, Molly Brown was actually a real leader on the life boats and took care of the sick and injured on the Carpathia, and mail room workers sacrificed their lives to try and save the mail for people back in the States. Granted, these are but a few instances of bravery, and a film needs central characters for a plot, but the story decided to focus on something petty and unrealistic in the face of true drama.The problem with the romance is this: it's contrived and it moves WAY too quickly. First, there is the issue that Jack totally takes advantage of Rose. She was about to jump off the Titanic. She clearly has some depression issues, and he thinks it's a good time to woo her? And Rose herself is a contradictory character. She seems to hate the life of a rich woman without independence, but she also looks down at Jack's social status as not being sophisticated enough. Besides, if she hated Cal that much she could just leave. Perhaps you say that Jack had to be the catalyst to that decision. That's fine, but remember that giving advice is one thing, swooping in and starting a tryst is another.And about Jack and Rose's relationship itself, just how prevalent could it have been, even in the 1990's, for a couple to engage in intercourse after knowing each other just two nights? Yes, it happens but not on average, especially between two people from totally different worlds like Jack and Rose and in the 1910's! And just where does anyone think the relationship would have gone after Titanic docked? Does Rose expect Jack, clearly a drifter, to provide for a family? For all of her desire to be independent and taken seriously, I don't think Rose wants to be destitute. I can understand the events if the two grew up together, but relationships that move this fast tend to be based on impulse, not love, and so they end up failing, yet as an audience, we are expected to believe that true love blossomed and died on screen. I felt like I was watching an episode of 90210. I'm sorry, but that is the definition of contrived. I am not saying scrap a love story period, but this ""relationship"" became a smokescreen for dividing classes. The movie goes out of its way to say that Jack is Jack because he is poor, and it can't work with Rose if he is rich.I know it may not be fair to bring up Avatar, but it does expose some of Titanic's characterization flaws. Our ""villains"" Cal Hockley and Rose's mother, much like the military and the corporation in Avatar are totally evil and Rose and Jack and the Na'Vi are totally good. The first class passengers are totally obnoxious. The third class is totally noble and blameless. So caricatures of people or groups of them constitute good writing? Granted, the struggle for third class to get to the deck for lifeboats was actually somewhat compelling, but it doesn't change the fact that everyone is portrayed at an extreme. The fact that people heralded the film is a sign that the audience accepted those caricatures and extreme portrayals as accurate.I will give the film some merit though. The design of Titanic has stood the test of time. After twelve years and change, it's still a beautiful set to see. Costumes, lighting and the ship itself are appealing and put the viewer directly in the setting. It's really a shame that style over substance has become Cameron's focus. His previous films actually had character studies. Aliens was a piece on Ripley's development and a Vietnam parallel. Can Titanic boast such a comparison? No. Still, it looked as good as the rest of his films.Titanic, for all its popularity, boils down to a superficial 1990's teen drama that targeted girls aged 15-18. That it decided to manifest itself during a tragic calamity is an insult. Why so many people older than 18 couldn't see Titanic for what it really was, is the bigger insult. Perhaps it reminded many of spontaneity long gone and that they wanted it again. Good Burger reminds me that I want a juicy sandwich from ""In and Out"" but that doesn't mean Good Burger was a good film.",Titanic

I have watched this movie for third time that make me cries every time. The love story goes deeper in meaning than any other.In some ways this movie is also a tribute to the power of memory and means so much.Because the story between both of them was not only a beautiful love story but it also captured the societal pressure of a young and wealthy woman in their time.So I absolutely love this movie in every single way possible.",Titanic

I am not a overly-enthusiastic about the majority of historical movies but, I decided to give this one a try. I remember it like yesterday. Walking into that theatre and smelling the scent of popcorn. There was a short line in front of the room where I was to watch the film because people were trying their best to get in on time. I picked a seat up front (even though I prefer to sit a bit farther back), and I got ready to view the film. The lights dimmed and the entire room fell silent. I remember that at the beginning of the film, I was slightly bored. The opening few scenes were different than most movies I had watched back then. But, as the film went on, I grew more and more excited to see what would happen next and I actually became invested deeply into the story. The intense ending with the ship sinking was scary - yet epic! And, when the movie came to a close I was thrilled. I had enjoyed it more than I ever thought I possibly would. I decided to buy it on VHS a few months later, and I played it for my (then teenage) kids. They loved it as well.There was not a single scene in this movie where I thought: maybe this isn't a great film or maybe this was a waste of time. Every single moment was another awesome moment and Leonardo and Kate's interaction with each other on screen felt genuine and real. I love this film now, and I expect I'll continue to love it as time goes on. It's become a classic and a definite must-watch for movie-goers of all ages!",Titanic

Engaged to a guy she did not love, well that changed when she met Jack. Rose was unhappy with her life, so she was going to jump into the water, but Jack convinced her of otherwise. From there the movie becomes better and better. The only part that really made me cry, was when the workers wouldn't let the people from 3rd class out. Well there is a mother and her two children and she tells them a story to help them sleep, knowing them would never wake up again.

I am glad Leonardo played the part of Jack rather then Brad Pitt because I think Brad Pitt is more suitable for the action movies. I must agree the last half an hour or so is very moving it brings a tear to my eye every time, especially when Rose (Kate Winslet) says to Jack ""I won't let go Jack"" then lets his body sink to the bottom of the ocean. And for those people who say the only good bit in Titanic is when the ship sinks, well these people are either in to modern day action thrillers and not into true stories, or they don't relise how well the movie resembles the real story of Titanic.

1838,wabbit99,Extremely overrated,6,5 December 2001,"In a bygone era, James Cameron's ""Titanic"" would be considered cinematic filler not worthy of being eligible for consideration among the greatest in the medium. However, in 1997, the packaging of a stale love story around expensive special effects was more than enough to garner this film an undeserving rout at the Academy Awards in March of 1998.The film's main strength is the recreation of the actual sinking of the ship. The cinematography and effects for doing that were first rate. However, all of that is undone by the story and moreover, the questionable selection of the lead actors, especially in the case of Leonardo Di Caprio.In summary, 'Titanic' is essentially a chick flick with some special effects thrown in to convince guys otherwise. That may have worked in 1997, but four years later, sorry.",Titanic

It was already in the last hour and a half where the ship was sinking, so I didn't really pay attention when I watched it (I was on the computer at the same time). The next day I turned it on when it was being re-ran, only to find it shortly in the same sinking scene.About a month ago, I was looking through the TV guide and saw that it was going to be on TV. When it came on, I sat and watched it the entire thing. When it was on again the next day, I watched again, left awestruck. How incredibly glad I am that I finally did watch it. Watching Titanic for me isn't just to see a ship sink. It's a way to escape reality, and be taken back to 1912. Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson) and Kate Winslet (Rose DeWitt Bukater) have chemistry unlike anyone i've ever seen, no lie. Jack and Rose may just be ""Star Crossed Lovers"" to some. I however, see them as more. Watching Leo and Kate act makes me forget where I am, what i'm doing, and not notice anyone around me. They're the reason i'm drawn to the movie. They're the reason why Titanic is what it is today, 10 years later.Rose is a 1st class girl being taken over to America to marry Cal Hockley. But, she is also upset with her life and wants to break free of feeling like a slave, and accomplish her own dreams. 3rd class Jack Dawson sketches people and wanders around on the streets, taking life as it comes at him. After Jack convinces Rose not to jump off the back of Titanic, they get closer and closer throughout the movie and fall in love. As you watch the 2 fall in love, it makes me want to jump in the screen, and actually be on Titanic despite it's fate. It makes me want to experience the chaos of a sinking ship or the touch of the icy water.Titanic makes me reflect on how I want to live my life; Of how I want to travel, try new things, meet people like Jack Dawson, and love someone how he and Rose did, even if it is for a brief period of time. I have seen many great movies in my life, but Titanic fits into its own category unlike the others. Jack and Rose have earned a spot in my life and I honestly give so much emotion when I say Titanin is a truly amazing adventure of tragedy and love, but never worth missing.",Titanic
1840,tfluppe,"Good movie, but worth all those oscars? I don't think so!",7,2 July 2002,"Sure, Titanic was a good movie, the first time you see it, but you really should see it a second time and your opinion of the film will definetly change. The first time you see the movie you see the underlying love-story and think: ooh, how romantic. The second time (and I am not the only one to think this) it is just annoying and you just sit there watching the movie thinking, When is this d**n ship going to sink??? And even this is not as impressive when you see it several times. The acting in this film is not bad, but definetly not great either. Was I glad DiCaprio did not win an oscar for that film, I mean who does he think he is, Anthony Hopkins or Denzel Washington? He does 1 half-good movie and won't do a film for less than $20 million. And then everyone is suprised that there are hardly any films with him in it. But enough about, in my eyes, the worst character of the film. Kate Winslet's performance on the other hand was wonderful. I also tink that the director is very talented to put a film of such a magnitude together. There is one lesson to be learned about this movie: there are too many love-stories as it is, filmmakers shouldn't try to add a crummy romance in to every single movie!!! Out of a possible 100% I give this film a mere 71%.",Titanic
1841,Inuyasha-o,Completely Underrated!,10,24 May 2007,"When I was a kid my sister forced me to watch Titanic with her. And I heard about it every ware everyday that it was good and amazing and people loved it. I wasn't one of those people, well the only thing I liked about the movie when I was a kid was the sinking.Now 10 years later I watch it now and I was amazed on how good this movie is! Its so incredibly made and put together, I fell in love with this film. Leo displays Jack Dawson beautifully and same with Kate with her character Rose. Leo and Kate make a perfect chemistry for a love story which is in Titanic.James Cameron did a very good job directing this movie by having both a love story and a disaster at the same time which is very hard to do. I was also shocked on how underrated this movie is!! 7 out of 10??? Come on people! This is easily one of the best movies ever made! It was very powerful and emotional. I am very picky with movies so I give it a 10/10 PERFECT MOVIE FOLKS!",Titanic

I genuinely believe this is one of the finest films of all time. I don't believe any film has ever connected with an audience in such an emotional way before.From the very beginning when Brock Lovetts ship searches through the rubble of the titanic on the sea bed for the heart of the ocean, we are hooked. All the events that lead up to the tragic scene at the end, just build the emotional scale to devastating proportions. The set is incredible, and the special effects are awesome, its very rare that a film so epic can be so personal and poignant(lord of the rings being one of the few others).But i believe a film has to be that long to connect with an audience in such a way, through the out whole film Cameron and the cast build you up to the heartbreaking scenes at the end, which could never have been achieved to the same effect in a 2 hour film.I implore you to see this film, or give it another chance if your one of the people who jumped on the anti-titanic band waggon.",Titanic

A timeless, moving classic that needs to be acknowledged!",10,11 August 2009,"This is EXACTLY what I think: It annoys me when people say they don't like this movie. Yes, it might not be a masterpiece but this was a damn good cinematic achievement. Ben-Hur has a higher rating than this and it's about a man and his encounter with Jesus. If they have an epic with Jesus mentioned that is IN the IMDb top 250, then they should have this movie in the Top 250. This was a very realistic movie. Yes, James Cameron might have stretched some issues but they are very plausible.I always tear up when the music gets intense (anyone who has seen this, will know what I mean) or when I hear the Academy Award winning song that was in this movie (My Heart Will Go On) I tear up. This is the ONLY movie that has made me cry. I don't think I'll find another epic like this that'll make me cry.I've watched about 3/4 of all the movies in the Top 250 and at the very least HALF of them are unworthy of the place they are in. Hell, about a third of what I watched ought not to be on this list but maybe 150 places above the Bottom 100 and that's me being nice.People just have to watch this movie with ABSOLUTELY NO BIASED OPINION or preconceived notion that they heard it was bad. That's how I came to love it. It's now my favorite movie of all time.The effects are the best I've seen since the epics of the 50s. The acting was brilliant and Gloria Stuart should have won Best Supporting Actress for Old Rose. Hell, Kathy Bates should have grabbed a nomination at least. Not a win, but just a nomination. Maybe Victor Garber should have gotten a nomination for Best Supporting Actor. The same with Jonathan Hyde. That's how believable I think this was. The second movie to win 11 Oscars in cinematic history and THE highest grossing movie of all time. This ought to be right up there in the ratings with Ben-Hur.People have to think twice about the rating they gave it and give it a higher rating. That's my opinion. I don't care what anybody thinks about it, it is just out there. Like it or hate it, think twice on this movie before giving it a low rating.15/10! That's what I believe.",Titanic
1844,luke2578,"A loathsome, sick and twisted movie!",2,15 May 2002,"In the past 6 months, I have looked back on this movie in retrospect and thought what a totally sick premise this film is based upon. It's a fictional tale of a true tragedy, which trivialises the impact of the Titanic sinking.James Cameron has the sickest mind I have ever known of. ""Let's make a love story on one of the greatest disasters the world has ever heard about."" Back in 1997, the movie execs must have been rubbing their hands together at the prospect of James Cameron (whose blockbusters have accrued masses of cash) doing a romantic movie on a poignant slice of history. However, around 2,500 people died on that ship, yet we only really focus on Jack and Rose running around the ship. Of course, this was Cameron's intention, so as to show the ship in all it's glory before it sank.The problem I have with the movie is that it's the equivalent of making a movie about a love story in the Twin Towers. A young business man in Tower A falls in love with a young business woman in Tower B. The man goes to Tower B, gets the girl and runs around all the floors of the Twin Towers (to show what the Twin Towers looked like before they collapsed). Then the planes hit the buildings and the story really kicks off. You get the idea. Entertainment based on a real-life tragedy, to me, seems really sick. It is a lot worse than programmes that the Daily Mail in Britain kick up a stink about.Morally wrong pictures like this should be banned, rather than Britain's banning of ""The Exorcist"" for 20 years, especially as Titanic was crap.",Titanic
1845,sarjot,the titanic is the most amazing movie ever and best scenes,10,7 July 2007,"I try, but i still don't see why people don't like this movie. this movie is one of those films that makes you completely break down, once you realize the full intensity of it. they say about 1500 people died that night, and 700 were saved due to the 20 lifeboats. only 20 boats to save over 2000 people. when you really think about it, and watch families be torn apart, it really shows the severeness of the whole situation. i remember i watched it the other night, and when i saw a family be ripped apart (because only women and children were being let on the boats), a dad told his children ""don't worry, there's another boat for the daddies"". i broke down at that part while i watched Jack and Rose being split because she was forced into a boat. you cant even imagine being there, and not knowing what was gonna happen to your kid or your husband or father. if you listen to Jack teaching rose about life during the movie, and telling her to ""make each day count"", it puts things in perspective. he showed her so many things and like she said at the end, ""he saved me in every way a person can be saved"". he loved her so much, and you can see the chemistry between the two, and that makes his death so much harder to watch. its not fair that he had to die like that after doing so much for Rose, but it made the story, and it made it great. Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio did such a great job with this, and James Cameron really pulled it all together as the director. you cant picture anyone else playing the parts...they did such a great job.there were some great scenes...like when Jack is handcuffed to the pole and Rose has to break him free with an ax off the wall so she takes a few practice swings and then tries to hit it in the same spot and misses by like ten feet! even though oddly enough she cuts him free perfectly as she smashes the chain with her eyes closed and then they have to wade through like really deep water.another is where the mother is telling a story to her two kids, so they will fall asleep and not be so afraid when they die..one of my all-time favorite scenes is where Jack and Rose are flying at the front of the ship. Celine Dion's ""my heart will go on"" seems like the perfect love song for this.also, the part where rose is on the Carpathia and give her name to the guy as Rose Dawson is one of the sweetest things ever.the part where she jumps off the lifeboat and her and jack run to meet each other and embrace each other where he tells her she is ""so stupid"" but is kissing her hair and neck and she says ""you jump i jump right?""lastly, i love the part at the end where old Rose...i guess dies....after they show all the pictures of her doing all the things Jack was telling her they were gonna do.....where she dies and you see them again going up the staircase, and all the people who had died and had gone down with titanic--Tommy Ryan, the Captian, Mr. Andrews, Fabrizio and Helga, Cora, and a bunch others...then the camera swings to Jack, at the top of the staircase, his back towards us, and him looking at the clock...just like he did when he had eaten dinner with first class. except he isn't all in his tux and all...he is dressed as himself and not all fancy...this movie was so amazing, and to all of those who say that it wasn't just that, you obviously cant see past what you don't like and look at what it really showed--two people in love, an ""unsinkable"" ship that is doomed, and a message behind it all.",Titanic

1847,v2pointoh,"Timeless, moving, and epic",10,17 June 2002,"Every once in a while the conversation will turn to ""favorite movies."" I'll mention Titanic, and at least a couple people will snicker. I pay them no mind because I know that five years ago, these same people were moved to tears by that very movie. And they're too embarrassed now to admit it.I just rewatched Titanic for the first time in a long time. Expecting to simply enjoy the story again, I was surprised to find that the movie has lost none of its power over these five years. I cried again.... in all the same places. It brought me back to 1997 when I can remember how a movie that no one thought would break even became the most popular movie of all time. A movie that burst into the public consciousness like no other movie I can recall (yes, even more than Star Wars). And today, many people won't even admit they enjoyed it. Folks, let's get something straight -- you don't look cool when you badmouth this film. You look like an out of touch cynic.No movie is perfect and this one has a few faults. Some of the dialogue falls flat, and some of the plot surrounding the two lovers comes together a little too neatly. However, none of this is so distracting that it ruins the film.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are wonderful. Leo is one of the fine actors of his generation. Wait 'til you see him in Gangs of New York before you call him nothing more than a pretty boy. Kate Winslet was so strong in this film. The movie really was hers, and she held it together beautifully.James Cameron managed what many believed was impossible by recreating a completely believable Titanic. The sinking scenes were horrific, just as they were that night. How anyone can say the effects were bad is beyond me. I was utterly transfixed.This film is one memorable scene after another. Titanic leaving port in Southampton. Rose and Jack at the bow, ""flying"". ""Iceberg, right ahead!"" The screws hanging unbelievably out of the ocean. The screams of the doomed after she went down. And that ending that brought even the burliest man in the theater to tears.The music, which has also been a victim of the film's success, was a key ingredient. James Horner's score was simply perfect. And the love theme was beautiful and tragic. Too bad Celine Dion's pop song version had to destroy this great bit of music for so many.I confess, I am a Titanic buff. As such, I relished the opportunity to see the ship as we never got to see it -- in all its beauty. Perhaps watching it sink affected me more than some because I've had such an interest in the ship all my life. However, I doubt many of those I saw crying were Titanic buffs. I applaud Cameron for bringing this story to the masses in a way that never demeaned the tragedy. The film was made with such humanity.Another reviewer said it better than I ever could: Open up your hearts to Titanic, and you will not be disappointed.",Titanic
1848,maaska0411,stop criticizing Titanic,10,6 June 2002,"Okay, people that are criticizing Titanic about how James Cameron just decided to make a movie about one of the most historic events in time and add a love story to it.  I read an interview with James Cameron.  He wanted to make a movie about the Titianic and show how grand and sad it's story was.  The only way he could do this however was to have it as a romance movie, though it's not completely a romance movie.  So there you go. Stop making rude comments about it.  I am a huge Titanic fan (the ship) so I know a lot about it.  I think that the makers of this movie were pretty truthful to the ship.  People this is one of those rare movies where it has everything.  Action, humor, romance, its educational, and just great.

1855,Queens624,Stole to much from earlier pictures and is very weak script wise,4,13 November 2005,"Titanic, in its day, was a film that captivated movie audiences all over the world. I had to admit that when it came out I wanted so badly to see and watch how the modern special effects would recreate the sinking of the liner. However, looking back on this picture in 2005 I have come to realize that despite some breathtaking special effects this film really isn't that original and doesn't really fit in to the aura of great American films, due solely on its lackluster script.The first problem with this movie was its lack of originality. Cameron had obviously lifted many scenes from the 1953 Titanic, and the excellent 1958 A Night to Remember. Rose's attempt to rid herself of her elitist rich lifestyle and its confines reign eerily familiar as Barbara Stanwyck tries to do the same for her children in the 1953 version. Also many of the sinking sequences reign familiar from the 1958 ANTR. Even the blocking and staging of the scenes are almost identical in their set up aka Thomas Andrews poetic stance in front of the Titanic's fireplace during the sinking. The film also fails, as the 1953 did on a level, in relegating the really interesting story of the sinking to the background of the plot. We are so in to the Jack and Rose story that when the sinking occurs it is given less time. We are always worrying about Jack and Rose that we miss out on all the other interesting stories that occurred on the night of the sinking and it is this point that leads to another major flaw in the story. By allowing the audience to feel the fear of the ship sinking, by watching Jack and Rose fight there way up flooded corridors, it diminishes the complacency the Titanic's passengers had towards the sinking. In ANTR we are lulled by the lack of panic by the passengers and crew when it comes to the disaster and then are shocked to see the ship sink. In Titanic Cameron is so worried about Jack and Rose that he compresses those scenes in which the lifeboats are being loaded off and thus creates a panicked feeling amongst the passengers when in reality they should be more reserved about the danger until almost the end.The second problem comes from the the archetypal and caricature way in which Cameron tries to explain the class division on the ship. Painting first class passengers in an ugly way, and third class passengers as selfless heroes is a tremendous error on the part of the filmmakers. Showing them in such a black and white way may help the audience see why Rose wants to flee her life and join Jack in his, but in doing so Cameron has severely misrepresented the actuality of the time. He almost makes it as if on the night of the sinking it was as if the first class passengers ardently wanted the third class passengers to not make it to the lifeboats. There was a whole array of behaviors in all three classes on the ship at that time. Painting the characters into such rigid, one dimensional ways was a big flaw on Cameron's part.The third problem lies in the acting and the love-story. Leonardo DiCaprio isn't one of the better actors out there. Despite the praise he gets from a lot of people I feel he's just a mediocre actor who happens to get cast in some high quality A level films. DiCaprio's Jack seems dramatically out of place in 1912. This is not mainly DiCaprio's fault as Cameron script is weak. He is written like a 1990's free spirit idealistic artist. DiCaprio obviously did not take the time to gear his Los Angeles Valley accent to that of a boy from turn of the century Wisconsin. His intonation in speech is indicative of that and he insults the British Winslet's fine execution of an American accent. He does not seem a product of his time. Jack's vulgarities throughout the movie, which where suggested in part be DiCaprio himself, seem out of touch with 1912. Vulgarities would be expected by a man of Jack's upbringing but the way he says S**T makes him sound like a 1990's teenager. We also never get to see Jack from the prospective of being dirt poor and the effect that fact has on his life. Instead Cameron only shows the idolized side that in the end inspires Rose to set out on her own. That in itself is a major flaw in the script. Jack does not seem to be a person by just an ideal to allow Rose to break free from her ties. And if Jack is just an ideal than how can we really believe that the two of them, have found a love with one another that will last. All the while one has to wonder what life would have been like for the two of them once the Honeymoon was over. Now that would have made for an interesting movie. Unfortunately DiCaprio's popularity as a teen star was just at its zenith when the movie was released creating one of the main reasons why this film had such a major draw at the time. DiCaprio's is not the only actor who is bad. Billy Zane gives an over the top, caricature performance as Cal, yet his less blameless due to the attitude in which his character was probably devised as (rich, mean , and arrogant). The only actor/actresses who seem to shine are Victor Garber as the astute and dedicated Thomas Andrews, and Kathy Bates as the brassy Maggie Brown (she was never called Molly during her lifetime). Unfortunately there parts are tiny in the film.All and all I say that Titanic, although visually impressive, falls flat just about every place else. You should only see it for its visuals and not for anything else. 4 out of 10",Titanic

The differences between the classes provide value to decisions in the span of human life. The passengers of the Titanic had their destinies decided through classes.

Conclusively, the movie Titanic exposed the fact that social stratification, not seaworthiness, decided the fate of many of Titanic's victims on its maiden voyage from England to New York on April 15th, 1912. In conclusion, the scenes of the Titanic prove that ""history is based on unending class conflict.""

But no matter how many times, I always manage to leave the couch and find something else to do, or fall asleep, or this one time I forced myself to keep watching, I had this inexplicable feeling of nausea as I watched. It has failed to keep my eyes glued to the screen as a movie lover.Good acting IMHO, I like the attention on scenic details, nice effects, it's got a lot of aspects that's supposed to make a movie successful (and I suppose these aspects had served their purpose), but the story and characterization are just... corny, and I get the feeling it's already been done for years and years. To be honest, it's like a romantic (corny) sexual fantasy of a curious teenage virgin from some decade ago with a grandeur setting. Not that I have anything against that turned into a movie, but why bother? The theme wasn't ""Titanic"" to me. The theme was ""Jack n Rose's Tragic Love on whats-it-big-cruise-ship-that-sank""Boring. I can ""fantasize"" something better. But at least somebody managed to make a movie out of it and made money, while I've never made any movie, so what do I know, huh? Well, at least all I know is that this movie just didn't impress me, and to top it off... What the heck is Celine Dion doing, singing that corny sappy hopeless romantic (emphasize on hopeless) theme song?They really tried hard to be ""titanic"" I suppose, that in my eyes, they end up the same as Titanic. *crack... *bye bye",Titanic
1861,shweta-lagisetty,Titanic--A saga of love,10,13 January 2010,"When I enquired my cousins about this movie they said that this is a OK movie. But to my astonishment when I watched the movie its awesome. Later I got to know that the tragic ending of the movie is not appealing to them. May be this is one of the reasons why most of the people could not forget this movie. Though it has got a tragic ending, it stages a wonderful love story that blossomed between a poor guy named Jack and a rich lady named Rose. It is a beautifully and carefully carved love story. I could not stop crying in some scenes. With titanic as backdrop, James Cameron perfectly presented the drama. You may say ""Ohh..its a routine love story with a bit of change in backdrop"". No I wont agree with you. It leaves a lasting impression in your heart. Making to the top of the World-wide Box Office records is not a common thing and this adds strength to my statement. The music in the movie is enthralling. Both Kate and Decaprio are in their tender age and are wonderful. I watched this movie many times skipping the last tragic scene when Jack dies. This scene almost squeezes my heart. As a whole the movie can be concluded as a master piece.",Titanic

It was beyond comprehension - the entire spectacle and production. I bought the books, read the history books and found myself immersed in all things Titanic.I didn't hurt that my great, great aunt was on the ship and survived. It makes it a little personal for me. In fact, I happen to own one of the only objects in existence that came off of the ship into a lifeboat and did not go into the water.Love the movie - it still is #1 in my book.",Titanic
1863,PPGcoolgirl,"Fantastic, but could have been better...",8,20 May 2010,"Titanic is a fictional story between two lovers on the ship, Titanic, that sank. James Cameron did a good job showing the sinking of the ship and the writing was very charming and at some parts, kind of funny. Kate Winslet as Rose was a good choice for the movie and she did a very good job portraying the emotions and difficulties of Rose. Leonardo DiCaprio on the other hand was good for the part, but he looked waaaay younger than Rose and it kind of made Winslet look bad in the movie.At the end of the movie, as the ship is sinking, James Cameron could have done a better job with the extras and their hard time staying on the ship. When I first saw the movie, that part actually made me laugh when I know I really wasn't supposed to.Kathy Bates I also thought was a weird choice for the movie, but she pulled the part off being ""new money.""(Even though she had a southern accent) All in all, it was brilliant movie and I don't pull down the whole movie just because of mistakes by James Cameron. It's mostly about the actors and how they pull off their parts.",Titanic

It came out when I was only 7, and, of course, I was not mature enough to understand what was going on. Watching it now, I can't possibly imagine how anyone could not like this movie.Every time you watch it it just gets better. The movie is incredibly layered, and you always see things you didn't the last time you watch it. I definitely would give this movie a 9 out of 10 stars, because it honestly deserves it.

1867,JetMax3,A very moving movie...,10,11 May 2003,"Almost a century ago, the magnificent ship cristened the Titanic sailed the ocean waters. It was the grandest ship of them all, and its luxury was unsurpassed at the time. But little did anyone know that its first voyage would also be its last and would come to be known as the grandest ship wreck of all time.After sitting beneath the waves of the Atlantic ocean for all this time, with only history texts and low-quality photographs documenting it, the era and the event has finally been brought back to life in its full glory. James Cameron's 1997 'Titanic' faithfully reproduces the ship itself as well as the tragic events that occured that faitful April night and with it unravels an untold love story that despite being fictional really brings the full emotion of the event to a personal level and humanizes the tragedy.This movie provides a little something for everyone. Romance, tragedy, action, adventure, all into one perfect mixture. Titanic has an awesome story and inspiring special effects and professional art to back it up. This film did not receive so many awards and nominations for nothing. The soundtrack is complete and touching in its own right, and the fiction and truth that make up the plot dance seamlessly and gracefully together.If you haven't seen this movie yet, witch considering its success is difficult to believe, then you definitely should. All three hours, give or take, is packed with candy for your eyes and ears as well as a wonderful story that will keep you on the edge of your seat. This will forever be a classic and a movie to remember. I will be watching this movie again years from now, and then many years from then.I give it a perfect ten out of ten, for me there were very few blemishes on this feature.On the grandest ship, under the worst circumstances, during the greatest sinking of all time, a story of love and passion unfolds for two people lost at sea. One will make it out, one will not, but they know that they will always be together--in their heart, at least.",Titanic

Also, the Lightstorm Entertainment logo animation is totally absent from this movie. wow..what an amazing movie it was.When I saw it fist time ,I felt so much wet feeling of deep love and One more thing, I have found subtitles of this movie from some site http://learnfreelanguages.110mb.com/t.html.",Titanic
1869,fulvius3,Incredibly impactful if watched without prejudice,9,3 June 2003,"I saw this movie in the theater before there was a huge buzz about how huge it was, and so I had no notions of what to expect before I saw it... and it blew me away.  I honestly feel that a lot of the reason some people are so critical of it is as a backlash to people's obsessiveness over it after it came out.  There is a reason people obsessed over it though - never since have I seen a film that has moved me more emotionally.I think the acting is quite good, especially by Kate Winslet and Bill Paxton, somewhat less so by Leonardo DiCaprio and Billy Zane.  The main things I think lacking are a really deep or philosophical message and real artistry to the filmmaking, but then again, it shouldn't have those - it's an emotional movie, not an art film.  The soundtrack is one of the best ever made for a movie, and the movie as a whole is just so grand and well done that it moved me to tears the first several times I watched it.  I would rate it a 10, except that it just dosen't have the depth and art, and rewatch value of movies like Requiem for a Dream, SE7EN, or the Matrix Reloaded...... but the point is, to get this movie, you have to be willing to watch it when you're willing to be emotionally moved, and without preconcieved notions about how it's overrated or sappy... If you do that, it *really* packs a punch.  Best chick flick ever made.",Titanic
1870,eval_2006,A Wonderful Titanic Movie which is not a documentary!,10,10 January 2011,"Let me start by saying that I watched Cameron's Titanic several times and each time with the same interest and feelings. I am a male, but this movie brings tears to my eyes every single time. Obviously not everybody is affected by it it as much as I was, perhaps expecting to see a documentary rather then romance and a sad story (wonderfully acted and filmed by the way). One should realize that this is far from a clinical examination of how the most famous ocean liner actually sank, but is really a story about love and devotion which just happens (whether real or not) to take place on a sinking ship. I do not believe Cameron intended to give an accurate account of an historical event here, and I am surprised how some critics fail to realize this.So if you're looking for a historical documentary, you won't find it here, but if you like a very well made romantic movie, some wonderful acting from Winslet and DiCaprio, and a drama created by a sinking ship you've come to the right place.",Titanic
1871,wandijoe75,Titanic,8,10 April 2012,It's a pretty good movie all around. The story line is interesting and draws you in and make you think. I love all the music and the actors as well. The movie is just a little too long but still one of the best movies of all time. 20 years from now it will still be worth seeing and still a tear jerker. No one should miss seeing this movie. It makes you want to know more about the Titanic and what happen all those years ago. It's a lesson teacher in so many ways not just a love story. If you miss it then you have missed a Winner.I can't see why anyone wouldn't want to see this movie. It's far from boring. Just imagine that's you or your love one on that ship and what would you do? Would you be able to handle it? As I stated the only downer was the time it was a little too long for my liking.,Titanic

1873,finslens,Nice Special Effects..Sappy Story (Spoilers),2,5 July 2005,"Spoiler to follow.All I could think through the agonizingly typical first two acts was ""sink the freaking boat already!!!"". In my opinion, the sappy, overdrawn romance between two strangers who become so in love with each other over the course of two days that they are willing to throw away everything, up to and including their lives, for each other, is not only corny and unbelievable, but disrespectful to the REAL people who died aboard that ship.The special effects were brilliant. The attention to detail in designing the sets and costumes was brilliant. The screenplay was terrible. This is a chick flick disguised as an adventure film. All we heard about in the months prior to the film was the historical accuracies and the amazing special effects, and 80% of what we got, was a formulaic love story...and oh yeah, there's a historic shipwreck in there too, which is prety cool.",Titanic

I really like DiCaprio's Character full of spirit and energy good attitude towards life he's a great Actor and James Cameron is a fine Director I do give this movie a 5 out of 5 great story and very entertaining you should watch this movie if you' never seen it before any one who likes a great movie will like this one",Titanic

Even if you haven't seen the movie in full, almost no one hasn't heard one reference in a show movie.. etc etc. There is just no way to avoid it ! This was the most expensive film made at the time, and it was money well spent.Now it is on the top 5 grossing movie of all time list. Director James Cameron is as good as they come, and will be remembered 100 years from now as the director of ""Titanic"". Kate Winslet is the perfect actress for this role and has the old rich charm that upper class people had back then. Leonardo DiCaprio became my crush of the century !!

1876,nordykechris,And i will always love you!!!,1,21 November 2012,"For those of you who saw the Titanic in the theater you are brave. This movie is a rip of Romeo and Juliet, it contains the boy who is considered to be in the lower class while the women is a high class person. As the story goes on we get crappy flashbacks from the past to the present and hear an old lady explaining her true love. And to make it worse the movie is 3 hours and 19 minutes long making every second of the movie even more painful. When i first watched this movie at home i checked my watch every other second and got tired of the storyline and skipped scenes. In my opinion it would be just easier to cut the movie down to 2 hours and 10 minutes instead, but then again this is James Cameron. Known for making long movies and crappy story lines. He should of just skipped this project and focused more on the Terminator or Alien instead, at least those films have action to keep the movie moving. In conclusion the movie ends with jack dying while rose some how survives the cold water. Overall i would give this movie a 0 if i could but instead it gets a 1 out of 10.",Titanic
1877,vick_aye,The Ship of Dreams,10,9 April 2012,"Titanic is without doubt one of the greatest masterpieces ever made to date. It is a timeless story of love, drama and excitement, all tied together with one of the biggest historical events ever.Basically put, it tells the story of Rose DeWitt Bukater, a 17-year old girl who feels trapped and isolated in a world of wealth, snobbery and a forced engagement to a man she doesn't love. While travelling on the R.M.S. Titanic, she meets Jack Dawson, a free-spirited third-class passenger. Over the short time they are together, Rose and Jack develop a strong bond and Jack helps Rose to escape her troubles and to to stand on her own two feet. When the ship hits an iceberg, Rose and Jack must rely on each other in the race to survive the sinking of the Titanic.Today I saw Titanic in 3D, and I can honestly say it blew my mind how well the effects appeared in the new third dimension. I felt like I was on the ship, fleeing the tide of water through the passageways, seeing the ship rise out of the water and dancing in third-class with Jack and Rose. Titanic will always be in my favorite films list, and I hope it continues to be in the heart of moviegoers for all time to come.My rating: 10/10",Titanic
1878,steve-cruz-327-430156,It is #1 for a reason,9,29 March 2012,"Titanic is #1 all time at the box office for a reason. What is that reason? What is it about this film that makes three hours in a cinema pass so quickly? It's not the suspense of not knowing what will happen next, after all history tells us in graphic detail the fate of Titanic. Neither is it What happens to Rose, I mean the mere fact that Rose tells the story as a hundred and one year old woman tells us that she survives. So what is it about this film that makes it so enjoyable? Well it's five things really: (1) The romance between Rose (Kate Winslet) and Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio). (2) Does Jack survive? (3) The gradual realization of the fate of Titanic and how it takes place (told with historical accuracy). (4) The remarkably accurate detail of the ships whole interior. (5) the special effects used during the sinking. All in all forget about the films supposed lack of technical excellence, poor storyline and trite dialogue and concentrate instead on the splendid entertainment on offer thanks to James Cameron's splendid direction, the superb cinematography and the excellence of the two leads.",Titanic
1879,ralph-wade,Decent not great,6,1 April 2012,"I finally got around to watching this film, and while Titanic is not a horrible movie, it really has no merit to be dubbed ""the greatest movie ever."" The love story is corny, the action sequences are mediocre, and to really believe that a homeless man can get a woman from an aristocratic dynasty is frankly, just laughable. Aside from all that, the computer graphics were OK, given the 200+ million dollar budget.I just don't get it. John Carpenter can make a cult classic like Assault on Precinct 13, or Halloween for a mere 100 thousand dollar budget. If you care to make the argument that ""well, that was in the 1970's,"" well you're wrong. Take for instance, Richard Rodriguez' 1993 hit El Mariachi. He made the movie for a mere 25 thousand dollars, and went on to earn more than 20 million. What I am afraid of is the sort of dismembering of the real creativity of writing, story, script, plot, acting, directing, that really make watching movies enjoyable. If you wish to add to the overblown hype to this mediocre trillion dollar production, shell out your hard earned dollars and buy the video, buy the soundtrack, buy the posters, DVD, etc.",Titanic
1880,ryan_bass,A Masterpiece of Our Time,10,26 March 2014,"This movie doesn't put a foot wrong! Over a decade after I first watched it,this film still tears my heart out and throws it in my face.Superb performances by the cast: a Golden Globe nod for DiCaprio (an Oscar nomination worthy performance? Decide for yourself), Oscar nomination for Kate Winslet and one for Gloria Stuart as well, who puts on an amazingly heartfelt retrospective performance. The film is worth a watch to see these alone.The visuals in this film are also stunning, even sixteen years later they still don't look outdated, so if that is your thing it's well worth seeing.A beautiful screenplay, well worth the three hour watching time to watch it unfold, you'll laugh and cry with realistic characters, dialogue and be awe-struck how the tragic scenario scenario provides a frame for the events.Finally for the soundtrack buffs... In my opinion, perhaps the best soundtrack ever written (James Horner take a bow) well deserving of the Oscar win. Some tragically beautiful pieces, even if you don't watch the film, check out ""Rose"", ""Unable to Stay, Unwilling to Leave"", ""Hymn to the Sea"" and ""Death of Titanic"". All masterpieces in their own right.This film is a well deserved 10/10 rating, if you haven't seen it then you should. Definitely in my top ten films to see before you die. A complete masterpiece.",Titanic

However the sub-plot between the two leading characters is predictable and ridiculous at the same time, the movie has so many pointless and annoying scenes like the axe and the handcuffs scene, the scene with the floating door and the scene where she throws the jewel into the sea, it completely turns the movie into a joke and loses all credibility in my opinion!

1883,FreddieDouglas,A massive bore,4,12 April 2014,"Simply put, Titanic is one of the most overrated movies of all time, in terms of how much money it made, how many people seem to like it, and how many awards it won. While the performances from Dicaprio (playing Jack), Winslet (playing Rose) and other supporting roles like the ship Captain are solid, the film on a whole just isn't. To sum up the film in one word would be ""boring"" or ""generic"". Titanic does't become the disaster movie until the very end, up until that its an extremely generic ""poor-boy-meets-rich-girl"" love story, something thats been done a billion times before. The film is also filled with completely two dimensional characters which I guess I supposed to reflect the times, with the segregation between the rich and the poor. Even so, the characters such as the one played by Billy Zane as Rose's rich husband to be, are just lazily written with no character other than ""I'm-rich-and-I-hate-the-poor-toff-toff"". The film overall is just a bore, and gets only mildly interesting when the boat actually starts sinking. Absolutely nothing special about this film whatsoever. One of the most overrated movies of all time.",Titanic

But I can't image anyone else for the parts they played. except for the beginning, the entire movie takes place on the ship. It's like this beautiful, timeless little universe, apart from the rest of the world. The costumes were beautiful, and the ship itself was perfectly done. And you feel such a sense of loss when it's over. It really makes you realize what a tragedy it was, in a way that few movies can. It feels like there is nothing in the world except the ship, and the fact that you know whats coming makes it all the more bittersweet. The scenes of the older couple, the young mother, and old rose throwing the necklace into the ocean, and what come after that, especially made me break down.",Titanic

I watched the movie on the TCM channel last week quite by accident. I had told myself that I would probably never see it because teen girls were seeing it a dozen times, and that made me a bit suspicious. I asked my wife if she had ever seen it. She said, like me, she had seen it on TV. My friends tell me that it is best seen in a big screen theater, but it is too late for that. Also, it is getting harder and harder to find big screen theaters. My wife, a reader, told me that it was not much of a movie. Her definition of a movie is one that fully develops the characters, and in the case of Titanic, the movie was just a vehicle for a love story between Leonardo and Kate. I was told that you could see the plot coming down the pike, and you could. I asked if it was not also the role of a movie just to entertain and was told that that is not enough. In thinking about what I was told I could appreciate that Titanic was not a great movie, but it was sure entertaining and jaw dropping, and I am not just talking about the sketching scene.",Titanic

To the outside person it may seem like a fictional tale of love during a horrible event in history, it has much more depth. Titanic is a movie about time and greatness. Titanics maiden voyage would also be its last. Titanic, being the biggest ship of its time, was something great to marvel at. It only lasted a short time. Jack and Rose's love was quite similair. Jacks new presence in her life changed who she was forever. He might have been the love of her life, and they were only together for a few days. The importance of the story is that you need to make every moment last, or you could let something great slip by. Ex: Jack could have forfeited in his game of Poker( with the stakes so high.) and would have lost the chance of a lifetime. Rose could have never talked to Jack again and would have gone on wishing she were dead everyday after. LIfe is to precious to let go , make it count!",Titanic

The music done by James Horner gives me chills every time I hear it and I am always listening to the soundtrack. I love how he captures the essence of the joy at the beginning of the movie when it is first leaving from Southhampton, through the love story of Jack and Rose to the heart-wrenching tragic ending of the RMS Titanic. The casting is superb Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are two of my favorite actors and have the most incredible chemistry, I really believed that they were in love. The story is amazing and I love how everything that does not happen between Jack and Rose is true, watching the extra features on the bonus DVD I saw the incredible resemblance between the actors and the real people who were on the Titanic, such as Molly Brown and the Captain. I cry for DAYS after watching this movie because it seems so real. The way that James Cameron captures the story of the Titanic through love, passion and tragedy is outstanding I really enjoy watching this movie but also I feel deeply for the people who lost their lives on that tragic day of April 15th 1912.

People protest at its two-day love story, and say that ""Captain Smith was a man who, realizing his mistake of ignoring the ice-berg warning,personally took on the responsibility of checking the damages himself."" That is true, and though I love the movie, I do wish that they had shown that.Leonardo DiCaprio (THE AVIATOR, WHATEVER HAPPENED TO GILBERT GRAPE?),deserved a Oscar nomination for his endearing portrayal of the live-for-the-moment young man named Jack Dawson.Kate Winslet (ETERNAL SUNSHINE OF THE SPOTLESS MIND,FINDING NEVERLAND),was the up and coming actress who was chosen for the part of Rose Dewitt Bukater. Her brilliant performance earned a Best Actress nomination, though it deserved the actual Oscar.The second part of the movie,(Spoiler Warning), in of which R.M.S. Titanic sinks,is touching, well done, mainly accurate, and very sad. Not only do you cry when the now beloved Jack dies, but also when Rose(Gloria Stuart), 84 years later, dies after telling her story for the first time. Victor Garber,Frances Fisher,Kathy Bates and Billy Zane add notable performances in this epic love story and tragedy.",Titanic
1892,smith44,"Greatest Film of The Twentieth Century, Ode To Titanic",10,24 May 2005,"Greatest Film of The Twentieth Century Titanic is without a doubt the most moving and artist film of my lifetime. Titanic closes off the end of the century with an ode to the age. A disaster to end all disasters, a love story to last all the ages and a film that will be better appreciated for its perfection in decades to come. The movie that has achieved the most Oscar nominations (14, and All About Eve) and has won the most Oscars (only rivaled to Ben-Hur and The Lord Of The Rings in Oscars). The most popular film all-time in Box Office terms, and the most Expensive film ever made. Testimate to its glory.Ode To Titanic",Titanic
1893,manuel15_jesus,Different points of VIEW about TITANIC!,10,27 November 2005,"Hello...I want to say that TITANIC is one of the best movies I've EVER seen and that I'm not ashamed what people thinks about me because of it.. My tastes are not bad.. it's just everyone has different points of view and not all likes the same thing..there will always be people who like and dislike something and if you ask for an answer they WILL tell you that it's because they don't like those movies.. As an example is TITANIC.. Lots of people hate that movie (most of them boys) cause it has something they don't like or simply feel ashamed of accept.. (I AM TELLING THAT CAUSE HERE WHERE I LIVE IT'S THE CASE) boys will never accept they like a romance movie cause they think their friends are gonna laugh of it.. I do like the movie and it's my favorite also.. the 2nd that i like is BRAVEHEART..well, that's all what i say for now.. take care you all! ;)",Titanic

I'll certainly eat crow on this one. Everything was well done and the actors were sincere and believable. The special effects rocked! Loved the rising sense of urgency.One negative comment though: Friend once taught me that there is a sliding scale in her universe. At the top is bacon, because it's so good. At the bottom is Bill Pullman, because he's so awful. How on earth Bill Paxton gets any work is beyond me. But cheerio, his role was minor enough not to ruin the movie.",Titanic
1895,starry-eyed_wanderer,"A Classic, Sweeping Love Story",10,5 April 2005,"I fell in love with this movie instantly after viewing it for the first time. Many people ridicule this film for its idealistic and often 'mushy' romance, and for the lovers' passionate relationship after being acquainted for no more than two days. Of course, perhaps 'Titanic' isn't the most believable story of all time, but in my eyes it's certainly one of the most entertaining. I don't watch movies to see reality, I see enough of that every day. If reality is what I had been hoping for when viewing 'Titanic', I would have been sorely disappointed in the love story (despite it's breathtakingly accurate portrayal of the ship's infamous death).No, 'Titanic' is more of a fairytale, one that sweeps you away and holds your attention until it's ending. It is the unforgettable tale of Jack, a poor but kind-hearted street urchin, and Rose, a wealthy but misunderstood young woman. When fate brings them together on the first and last voyage of the Titanic, they must face many trials and tribulations in order to pursue their forbidden love. Keeping them apart is Rose's mother, who insists that her daughter marry a stuck-up rich man, and Cal, Rose's malicious fiancé to whom she is to be wedded by force. While Jack and Rose are willing to face these odds for each other, there are some things which cannot be faced down, one of them being an iceberg, the ultimate destruction of their relationship.Despite its joyous fairytale like aspects, it is still very tragic. A feel-good romance and a tragic epic all in one, like a brilliant cross between 'Romeo and Juliet' and 'Cinderella'. For the first half of the movie I was overwhelmed with a wonderful feeling. For the second half I was near tears. Finally, the movie's amazing conclusion was sending chills down my spine, and I felt as if I couldn't decide if I was happy or sad.Leanardo DiCaprio is mischievous yet sweet-natured as Jack, and masterfully brings across what is, in my opinion, the most memorable and lovable role in the entire film. I found Kate Winslet almost, yet not quite, as impressive as DiCaprio in her role as Rose, who although seeming perfectly content and fortunate outwardly is misunderstood and desperately miserable inside. Jack sees this hidden part of her, recognizing her longing for freedom and helps her to fulfill it. The remaining cast shines as well.Watch this movie. Enjoy it. Forget the real world, and lose yourself in 'Titanic'.",Titanic

1897,virginia_vis,Absolutely fantastic!!!,10,4 July 2005,"Titanic...wow! This is my favourite movie ever! Why?...well it's simple. It has everything I have ever looked for in a film. Great story (inspired from a true story-even better), cool characters, witty lines, touching ending and - on top of everything - an extraordinary love story. The story all in all is believable and only an insensitive person wouldn't empathize with the characters and feel their pain. I am also very fond of the soundtrack of the film ""My Heart Will Go On"" by Celine Dion. I think that the song captures the essence of the film and is appropriate for the love story between the two characters (Jack and Rose). Titanic is an impressive movie, which will never seize to amaze me. Moreover, I think that the Oscars (all of them) are more than well-deserved. This film is a must-see for all those who haven't yet watched it... I especially recommend it two romantic person who are into heart-breaking-romances. Enjoy! My vote: 10/10",Titanic
1898,davereed8,A great film that must be seen by all movie lovers,9,10 January 2006,"An astoundingly brilliant film that must be seen by all movie fans. Raised the bar significantly with a perfect combination of special effects and emotion thanks to great acting by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Its easy to see that the 2 of them had a great on and off screen chemistry. The success of the film however is down to James Camerons meticulous direction and dedication, undoubtedly his best film. At a cost of 200m it was the most expensive film ever made when released in 1997. When watching the film I forget that the ship is mainly computer generated and the waves arn't real. I was swept along by the sheer spectacle of the film. Three hours of film that never leads the audience astray and has a final one and a half hours that is the most gripping of any epic I have ever seen. The most successful film of all time doing 1.8 billion at the box office world wide and winning 11 Oscars. It deserves all the success it has had and is a true masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, see it! p.s get the special edition DVD,preferably 5 disc",Titanic
1899,angelos1974,"A stinking floater, that just won't flush away.",1,27 April 2019,"This movie sucks like a $2.00 lady of the night who has been given $20.00 and told to keep the change. Only a vacuum cleaner that's been left running for 24 hours straight sucks more than this movie. It's the suckiest movie that ever sucked. I've seen grade school plays that were better than this movie, honest to God, PLAYS!What has warranted such dislike from me? Two words, forced viewing. I was forced to watch this drivel by my wife, and not only that, I payed my hard earned cash to waste my life watching a poorly-acted 'love-tragedy' that seemed to go on and on. I actually felt envious of the characters that died in the movie, as, essentially, their suffering was over. Never have I seen another movie that was filmed in such a manner that would please the 'luvvies' so much, so they'd just throw Oscars at it. But what about the cash-paying viewers?! Sure, the special effects are impressive, but that alone does not a good movie make, a good story that's interesting would be greatly appreciated, but instead we get Lenny D' Crapio, as eye candy for the ladies, the obvious target audience, and the poor men who've been dragged to the theatre get no love at all.In conclusion, this movie would be playing on repeat for eternity in my version of Hell. I wish I could give it minus 1000,000 stars.",Titanic
1900,tanie_kitty,Great movie,10,18 April 2005,"I really enjoyed this movie. It's definitely worth the ticket price. The movie does a great job showing what life was like on the Titanic. The actors even looked like the people they were playing. Another thing I liked was the scene where the little boy is spinning a top on the deck. It's from a famous picture taken aboard the ship. The actor who played Captain Edward J. Smith did an awesome job. That's a very important role in the story of the Titanic. I quite a few people went to see this movie just because Leonardo Decaprio is in it. I was not one of those people. I've been reading about this ship since third grade and when my dad offered to take me to see it, I couldn't pass up the offer. Any Titanic buff should see this movie. It's the best depiction of the ill-fated maiden voyage I've ever seen.",Titanic
1901,jhardy-2,A great movie that has some gotten a bad rap,10,3 May 2005,"The perfect disaster movie. Just think about all those movies that have great effects and then try and through in a love story. Then think of Titanic, which is first and for most a love story, surrounded by amazing effects. Sure the movie isn't perfect, the dialogue could have been a little better. The movie starts a little slow, but then at some point you are drawn in and the characters become real, and the terror they face becomes real. By the end, when Rose dies and meets Jack on the staircase and everyone cheers it is impossible not to feel sad. This movie could had been horrible but it pulls it off. It was a real risk to make and it worked wonderfully. The reason this movie works is hard to describe. Maybe it's the slow beginning that does it. We start to forget that this ship is destine to sink and just watch what is on screen. Then when they finally do hit the ice berg the viewer feels that this is an interesting plot turn rather than the payoff the movie has been building to.",Titanic
1902,blondeatheart330,a classic,10,11 May 2005,"Titanic is one of the best movies ever made, and that is proved with the record for the most money made at the box office (about 700 million). This extremely long movie stars Leo DiCaprio, who plays Jack, a poor teen with only ten dollars in his pocket, and Kate Winslet, who plays Rose, a spoiled girl who's life has already been planned by her controlling mother and malicious fiancé. Jack and Rose fatefully meet aboard the 'unsinkable' Titanic on its first and last voyage in 1914. Jack saves Rose from her predictable life and teaches her that she's in control of her life, not her fiancé or her mother. Rose and Jack's romance is short-lived, as we all know what happens to the Titanic...This movie is the saddest and the longest movie I've ever seen, but 3 hours spent watching it are completely worth it. Titanic won 11 Academy Awards, and when you watch the movie you can understand why.",Titanic

Fiction and non-fiction were interwoven to such a fine twist that not even jealous people who wish they were in or wish they had made the movie themselves can spoil it. It's going to be a VERY long time before anyone whips this one for imagination or ""how to tell a lie and get away with it"".As many times as this story has been told, no one has ever quite told it with that kind of depth and breadth and scope and magnificence of clarity of vision and focus.",Titanic

1907,cornellthorn,A Fantastic Movie,10,7 October 2014,"I never thought that a ship wreck would be able to produce such an amazing, and romantic movie. James Cameron did an amazing job at synchronizing a horrific event in history with the everlasting love between Jack Dawson and Rose Bukater, who was played by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. Titanic is a movie that keeps you on your toes whether it's between the two love interests or between the tragic events that is happening to the ship, and the people while the boat plunges into the water. To me Titanic is a five out of five movie because of the amazing actors/actresses, the story line, the message it relays at the end, and all the different characters that made this movie so diverse. While watching Titanic you have no choice but to fall in love with the characters which made me want to watch the movie even more. The actors/actresses were amazing when portraying the characters they were supposed to be. The way they fell into character so easily was elegant. The director made the characters so diverse, which made it more interesting to see how different classes of people were treated back in 1979. The people that were chosen to portray the characters actually looked as if they were born for that particular role. You could feel the sincere emotions the actors were giving off while in character which made the audience open up to the movie. The movie was so interesting that the audience could watch the movie over and over again and it will never get tiresome. A contributing factor to success of Titanic was how the movie told the background of some of the characters. They were able to tell the story behind most of the cast members like the husband, mother, newlywed couple, and the young unfortunate families. Some of the characters in the movie might have not been intended to be significant, but ended up being very important to the impact the movie had on the audience's emotions. For example while the boat is sinking there is a mother who is tucking her kids away into their beds. She felt like that was the only choice she had, because she knows that with their social status they would have no chance of survival. All she wanted to do was comfort her kids and make sure they were at ease right before they all perish. Just that scene alone played an important role in the audience reaction and emotions. The movie also relayed a very unique personal message that was very meaningful. The Director showed that love can conquer anything, and can last forever even throughout death. In the beginning of Titanic we noticed that the very first time Jack saw Rose he instantly fell in love. Through the entire movie the audience see how their connection grows into this deep love that neither one of them have ever experienced. Rose was engaged to one of the wealthiest men on the boat, and she gave it all away because of the connection her and jack shared. Even when the ship was sinking Jack and Rose was so passionately in love they literally did anything for each other. For example, Rose went into the bottom of the boat, which was filled with water, to rescue jack, who was handcuff to a pipe and left to drown. Also, Rose jumped off one of the only life boats in order to stay with jack cause she knew that she couldn't go on without him, or how Jack let rose lay on floating wood in order for her to stay out the freezing water and stay alive. All of those contributing factors made the movie great. I fell in love with Titanic and will recommend the movie to anyone. After watching this movie it became a part of history and any and every one would love watching it. When watching the movie you fall in love with the message that the movie gives you. The characters that are being portrayed make you fall in love with the movie as well. This movie makes you want to watch over and over and anyone would love it.",Titanic
1908,OttersFilms,Disappointing,2,1 April 2021,"I saw the film after its successful Oscars haul and found it a major let down. It seems that the more effort that film makers put into special effects, the less attention they give to the script.I wanted to like this film but found it impossible to do so when, for me, the dialogue was dull, cliched and obvious; the special effects, although good, were not great and the central romantic relationship was unconvincing.I did admire the costumes and sets, but overall it wasted an opportunity to create a memorable work of art and pay tribute to the fallen victims. The old Kenneth More film (A Night to Remember) is much better and was perhaps designed for an adult and not a teenaged audience.",Titanic

There's been a thousand love stories where one lover dies at the sake of another: Cruel Intentions w/ Sebastian and Annette, West side story w/ Tony and Maria, Romeo+Juliet w/ Juliet thinking Romeo's dead, she cant live without him and that's d**n romantic. I'll admit the sets and costumes are gorgeous but the story's not that extraordinary-rich girl in an arranged society/political marriage with a loveless fiancé meets the charming almost always artistic poor boy who whirls her off her feet with the simple romantic things in life only to have the relationship be tragically struck down by fate-cough, cough-THE NOTEBOOK-coughI don't mean to be trash Titanic, just someone tell me what makes it so d**n special?

1910,garry-r-richards,A real event,1,22 July 2005,"In many ways Titanic is a great movie. The effects are realistic enough to let you get right into it and the performances are generally very good; especially the gorgeous Kate who convinces with, or without, her kit on. It is a story of an ill fated but grand love affair. An unhappy heiress falls for a lovely poor guy over the rich, handsome, total bastard she's engaged to and trouble inevitably follows. This epic story is played out against the backdrop of a ship sinking which adds to the emotion, poignancy, hysteria and general tearfulness of it all and therein lies my problem with this flick.Before Titanic was a film it was a ship. Many real people died. Their families still remember. (yes even a century later), This movie is not a tribute or an insult. It is a disregarding of their memory. Jack and Rose could have had their moment in any one of a thousand scenarios. Why sully this tragic event?The sinking of the Titanic is a great historical tragedy. Not only death, but needless death, plus the loss of a magnificent machine, which was a tribute to human endeavour and ingenuity. The folly of her reckless handling in dangerous waters ( That's the ship, not Kate). The stupidity of man's ""unsinkable"" challenge to nature. The struggle of the crew to save as many people (especially rich ones) as possible. What a great film that could be (they tried to make it in 1958). A story that respected every gasp for air, every self sacrifice, every bloody engineer. Why did we need Jack and Rose? Is this the price we pay for Hollywood.",Titanic

1913,ramichiaviello,"Titanic is an overrated, boring film but gets good after 2 1/2 hours",6,24 May 2015,"A lot of people like Titanic. Seeing it won 11 Oscar's and grossed over 1 billion dollars. I really did not care for this movie. It is long, boring and takes around 2 and a half hours for it to get good.Titanic is an ""ok"" movie. Leo does a good job like he always does, portraying a poor man who falls in love with a rich girl. Kate Winslet in my opinion, was a bad choice. She tries her best to act rich and proper but fails in general. Near the end she improves her acting but still is very stale. Billy Zane in my opinion really shines out of the two leads. He does a good job portraying someone who is very sophisticated, but also shines in all the other parts, when he is jealous of Leo and Kate's characters.What did I have wrong with the movie? It is so long. 3 hours and 14 minutes! It takes 2 1/2 hours for it to get to the iceberg alone. The first 30 minutes of the film, is Bill Paxton and his crew trying to find the blue diamond (whatever it's called). Then the next 2 hours, are back and forth between Leo and Kate. While watching the film, I found myself tapping my foot in boredom and wondering when is it gonna get good. I really could have cared less for the first 2 1/2 hours. Sure, there are a few good scenes here at there, but it takes so long for it to get to the good sequences.Even thought this picture is long, I should give credit where credit is due. The visuals are stunning. After watching this more then 10 years later, I still can't tell that the ship and the scene where it breaks it in half to be fake, where I can when I watch things like The Matrix and Toy Story.Also, the last hour of the film is really good. I really have nothing to complain about. Cameron did a good job. The ending is emotional but a little stupid. He could have fit on top of the wood, he did not really have to die.Anyway, Titanic is long, boring but gets good near the end. 6/10",Titanic

1916,weesharobb,Titanic: The Story of the Beauty at the Bottom of the Ocean,9,12 October 2015,"The sinking of the RMS Titanic is still known to be one of the most resounding events to take place in generations past. The film Titanic is a romanticized version of the heartbreaking story of that ""Unsinkable Ship."" In this film we follow Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet) as they fall in love with the ship, and each other. Their love is a Romeo and Juliet kind of story, with Jack being of the lower class and Rose being of high class from a wealthy family. Rose must make a choice to either listen to her mother and marry the man her mother chose for her, or to follow her heart and be with Jack. This movie keeps you intrigued and focused all the way till the end.How Jack and Rose met was an odd story. Jack ended up winning tickets for both him and his friend, Fabrizio (Danny Nucci) for the Titanic in a ""Lucky hand of poker."" They both were of the lower class and were staying in the lowest floors. When they were out walking around on the deck, Jack looked up and saw Rose and it was love at first sight! He knew she had to be rich because she was on the higher deck. He knew he would have to find a way to talk to her. One night Jack heard a scream and ran to see who it was, and it was Rose. She was hanging of the front of the ship. He ran to help her and the guards saw. This was the start of the love story of Titanic. Throughout the movie we see Jack and Rose grow closer and closer. Eventually Rose chooses Jack and lets her fiancé, Caledon 'Cal' Hockley (Billy Zane), know about their blooming love. They begin to get into a lot of trouble throughout the ship and out of nowhere the ship hits an iceberg. They then must decide what they are going to do to survive. We follow their decisions in the last moments of the ship and possibly their lives!Titanic won numerous awards including an Oscar for Best Cinematography. Titanic has some of the most eye-catching and well done camera work of any movie I have seen. The scene with Jack and Fabrizio on the front of the ship looking out is such a stunning image. The sun is just beginning to set. This scene even makes us feel like we are ""The king of the world!"" We can really see how high up they are and that they are in the middle of the ocean. The camera then pans down to the ocean and we can see dolphins swimming next to the ship. Titanic also won an Oscar for Best Picture, and rightfully so! The story is so original and unique, even though it is something so familiar to all of us. How the film makers mesh together all the scenes to make us feel like it is really happening right before our eyes is just spectacular! The colors are so vibrant and give you a feeling of warmth and closeness. The literary aspects of the movie have become the reason why so many of us watch and re-watch this film time and time again. The story line just keeps you wanting more. Rose and Jack's love story is something we all want to feel some time or another in our lives, but maybe not the whole sinking ship and cheating on your fiancé thing. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio did an amazing job portraying their love for one another. You really are able to see it in their eyes. Overall Titanic is one of the most classic and fascinating films you are going to see. To this day, I still want more.",Titanic
1917,teababy-67170,The Greatest Movie Of All Time!!!!!,10,12 October 2015,"Titanic, directed by James Cameron, earned a whopping 11 Oscars in one night. Those Oscars include; Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Effects, Sound Effects Editing, Best Effects, Visual Effects, Best Music, Original Song, For the song ""My Heart Will Go On"", performed by Céline Dion, Best Music, Original Dramatic Score. It also earned 7.7 stars on IMDb public voters. In my option Titanic was one of the greatest movies of all time, because of the great acting scenes and the emotion bond connection I am able to make with the characters, and with Leonardo DiCaprio staring in the film was just the icing on the cake.Titanic is a movie about a rich girl, Rose (Kate Winslet) and a poor boy, Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) or helplessly falls in love with each other. But Rose (Winslet) is engaged to a rich business man named Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). Even though Rose (Winslet) doesn't want to marry Cal, her mother wants her to marry him because they are in need of money. While on the flip side, Jack Dawson (DiCaprio) is a poor 'floater' who moves from place to place looking to make quick money so he can survive. When he first sees Kate it was love at first sight for him, but he doesn't know she is engaged. Later in the film Kate and Jack fall in love and spend as much time together, of course Rose's fiancé finds out and like any normal man gets extremely upset and jealous. When he tries to put a stop to it, it backfires in his face. Meanwhile Captain Edward James Smith (Bernard Hill) gets a message that there is an ice burg ahead, but he ignores it so he doesn't upset Mr. Ismay, who wants to keep the boat moving in full speed. He has people on the lookout, but they don't see the ice burg until the last minute. The Titanic hits the side of the ice bug causing a big hole in the side of the boat. As the boat quickly fills with water, people start to freak out and many lives will be lost as the water engulfs the 'Unsinkable boat'. To me the second best aspect of the film would defiantly be the music. The first being the characters, but we'll save that for another day. The music in the Titanic helped build the suspense and also add to the theme. My Heart Will Go On"", performed by Céline Dion, is one of the best songs in the film. When they added the song to the background, the ship was sinking, and you saw the fright and terror in everyone's eyes. It made your heart fill with sorrow and turned on the waterworks. It was a strong scene with little action, but it spoke loud and clear, and at the end became of the best scenes in Titanic.My overall opinion of the movie is it was one of the best movies I have ever seen. If you want to see a classic movie that will make you cry this is the first movie I will suggest to anyone. Even if don't like some of the actors or actresses, you will inevitably fall in love with them through the Titanic. If I were to give this movie my own personal rating, it would be a trillion times infinity.",Titanic
1918,InHong,My favorite movie,9,28 September 2015,"The movie of Titanic came out in 1997. And then was an Oscar award winning. The director is James Cameron. And the actors is Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack and Kate Winslet as Rose. This movie is love story. The Titanic was a ship that sank in 1992. It reorganize show film. When play ""My heart will go on"" song that will impress the movie, and then the love feeling. 3 hours long time, and then my watching is very romantic every plots, what is follow next plot. For example, Rose was flying in ships beside, that audiences were touched my heart by this shot. And then the scenery of breaking dawn is beautiful and wonderful. Every girl want instead of Rose that is romantic plot. Second, the passengers confused around the ship after the Titan crashed iceberg, unless musicians played on ""Wedding Dance"" so quiet. The shot was satirized by this gimmick point.Discussing technology, the titanic used model ship, which have shoot really effect. The passengers fall down and slide on the floor after the titanic was sinking in the ocean. The technology is very amazing in 1997, that isn't easy play on video. So, the video is a big making that appreciate the director designing, and then the plot had a nervous environment.The movie is my favorite. Jack and Rose is excellent, and then bring me have a romantic feeling. It was complete the end from embark to accident, let's me watching Titanic event. I feeling that your life must have once watching ""Titanic"", you will understand what the movie is successful.Finally, no matter how watching again, the movie couldn't boring.",Titanic
1919,elsahouse,The ultimate failure of Backlash,10,12 April 2018,"Haters clearly don't understand how emotion is part of the humanity and Titanic is full of emotional element and therefore, a true humanity in cinematic world. If a movie make so many people left the theater in tears, clearly haters lost their heart and intelligence Haters clearly don't understand, how Titanic mixed the spectacle visual experience and top-class technology filmmaking process with emotional element and sense of melancholy. The movie proved that visual sensation and emotional experience are not mutually exclusive.Eyes and Heart are synced, but hater's brain aren't synced with blood,",Titanic
1920,romanzi,The best movie ever,9,15 January 2016,"I never get sick of this movie. I could watch it 2000 times, to experience every single emotion it communicates. The story is pretty simple: an old lady decides to tell the scientists who are working on the Titanic wreck about her trip on this ship. She was a girl coming from a 1st class family. She is moving to the US to marry Cal, wealthy business man. Everything changes when she casually meets Jack, a broke artist who won his ticket on the magnificent Titanic with a lucky card game. I liked everything: from the characters, to the location, from the direction to the music. If you didn't yet, please watch it, you'll not repent.",Titanic
1921,donald-w-west,Best documentary,10,27 July 2005,"Although this is a fictional account of the event, I feel it is perhaps the best portrayal of life and times of the Titanic era. It is a strong warning against overconfidence in our technical abilities and human pride to solve every problem and prevent disaster. Ignoring iceberg warnings and failure to take precautions, even in matters of the ship's design and number of lifeboats, depict human error as the frequent cause of failure it is. Man's greatness pales in the face of nature and nature's God.One cannot relate to history without putting a face on it. Kate Winslet's beautiful face (and the others) do the job superbly. Everything about this film is wonderful, including the writing, photography and acting. Instead of dry textbooks, school children should view this, with some precautions against nudity and unnecessarily strong language. I find the story very satisfying, cleverly executed and highly informative. No doubt this will be a perpetual monument to that ""unsinkable"" ship and all those who died.",Titanic
1922,ruebels,"If you don't like this film, you have an agenda",10,11 December 2007,"Let me preface this by saying I don't like ""chick flicks"". While Titanic does fall into this category, it also transcends it. It is a smartly crafted (having the present day scientist explain exactly what happens to the ship, so we as audience members are not confused later), well acted, and expertly edited masterpiece. There is no need for me to go into the story, as we all know it by now. I truly believe that the ones that hate this movie are self indulgent, wanna-be rebels who would hate anything if it didn't fit into their version of what ""real"" art should be (ie. cheap, not made for the masses). These people are as closed minded as racist KKK members.",Titanic
1923,holyghost_partygirl89,Beautiful!,10,12 October 2005,"Except for the unnecessary language and most of the sexual content, this was one of the best films I have ever seen. Leo's performance as Jack was somewhat over the top and cheesy, but that is to be expected considering that it's Leo DiCaprio. Kate Winslet's character really fit her. I have seen her performances in other films but none compare to this one: the rich girl who thinks she's seen it all until she meets the man from the other side of the tracks. Seeing her in this film was seeing yet another side of Kate Winslet. Kathy Bates is hilarious as Molly Brown and I would not have put her in any other role. The end of Titanic had me on the edge of my seat. You know what's going to happen, but you're just not sure how or when it's going to happen. All in all, this was a beautiful film that should be viewed by everyone.",Titanic
1924,Daisy101,"Beautiful, tragic and tear-jerking",10,16 December 2005,"I first saw this movie when I was nine years old (I am now twelve). I think that some parts of it were difficult for me to understand three years ago, but now I can see this movie very clearly as a masterpiece.It all starts in the middle of the ocean. A team of men are working to try to hoist long-lost treasures out of the Titanic, a ship that contained many treasures belonging to wealthy passengers. Nothing is found - apart from a drawing of a young woman. The men investigate the drawing closer, and manage to find the woman in it, who tells the story of her experiences on Titanic.Rose DeWitt Bukater is a young, beautiful and wealthy woman, travelling back to America with her mother and fiancé, Cal Hockley. She detests everything about her life, as all her mother and companions think about is money. She see's no way out of this trap - until she meets Jack Dawson; a poor and talented American artist, who instantly falls in love with her. At first, Rose is hesitant and slightly icy towards Jack, but then realises that she loves him too. This causes immediate feuding between Jack and Cal, which seems unstoppable.Just as Rose and Jack's relationship starts to blossom, a major disaster sticks upon the Titanic. A disaster that cannot be helped.Excellent and memorable acting is given from all of the main characters - particularly Kate Winslet as Rose, and Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack. I have to admit, I can't watch this movie a single time without crying; it is very emotional with some very sad scenes. Very beautiful, yet sad. I would recommend this movie to everyone between the ages of 9 onwards. No-one should miss out of this top-class drama, that holds many records. **********",Titanic

1926,lightoller1874,I Saw It 22 Times,8,1 September 2005,"Yes, I actually saw this film 22 times on the big screen and many times on VHS/DVD. People like to joke that I can lip sync most of the script and they are probably right on that score.Most of the real beauty of the film lies in its accurate sets--Cameron's TITANIC is the most accurate TITANIC movie to date, it looks as if you are on the ship herself. The ""Take her to sea, Mr. Murdoch"" sequence is absolutely breathtaking--seeing those engines start to turn faster and faster and faster, and the sound track with made it sound as if they were saying ""full-ahead! Full-ahead! Full-ahead!"" was mind-blowing I didn't think the love story all that plausible--not with the strict class segregation of the age. Jack would have been able to attend church service on Sunday (in fact it was a ritual for people from Second and Third Class to attend the service and was called ""going up the ship""). I do not believe, however that he would have ended up at a First Class Table, and especially not one where JBruce Ismay was dining.My main demerits to this movie would be in reference to the actors and script sounding way too 90s. ""So what are you, an artist or something?"" Dunno. Doesn't sound all that 1912 to me. But if you can get past the love story and the attempt to make characters living in 1912 sounds as if it was 1997, then I think you will enjoy Cameron's TITANIC.",Titanic
1927,ethanhatcher,Meh,3,16 December 2016,"I enjoyed watching this film. The visuals were good and the depiction of the sinking itself is good. But throughout, the film, and especially through the cheesy romance scenes, I couldn't help but think, ""there were 2200 people aboard the ship. Shouldn't at least ONE of them have a movie worthy story? It was a tragic night/morning, so why would Mr Cameron need to make a fake story when he could find an actual survivors story."" A thing it did right was the humanization of the disaster. When they focused on a non jack/rose character, I.e a real person like Captian Smith or Andrews or the Strausses and especially the band, the result was great. I don't consider myself a manly man, but normally I don't show much sadness for movies. However, I teared up a couple of times during the film (not during jacks death). The parts I'm talking about are the ""Nearer My God, To Thee"" scene and rose's heaven. But there is a very good reason DiCaprio didn't win an Oscar for this. HE AND WINSELT'S ACTING WAS BAD! It was just plain wooden at best. And don't get me started on jack didn't have to die. I agree. Yes the panel (ITS NOT A DOOR) could of held both of them, but only after they put the life preserver under the panel to improve buoyancy. But I'm going further back than that. ROSE WAS ON A FKING LIFEBOAT! THERE WOULD BE 1500 PEOPLE ONBOARD WHO WOULD KILL FOR A LIFEBOAT SPOT! AND SHE HOPS BACK ON THE BLOODY SHIP! WHAT DOES JACK SAY RIGHT AFTER!? ""You're so stupid Rose!"" YEAH, YOU ARE! BUT OLD ROSE BEING OLD ROSE Doesn't REALIZE THAT KILLS JACK!!!! OK, now that that's done, it was a mediocre movie at best.",Titanic
1928,dx2-2,Complete and utter trash,1,24 September 2005,"Now firstly, I was impressed at the effort put into this film... HOWEVER, after seeing it, I have come to this conclusion: This would be a great movie were it not for the lack of originality, what you see here is an ancient plot line marketed on the blood of people who died in this tragedy, if you want to see a similar film, get out Romeo and Juliet (another DiCaprio film) which contains exactly the same appalling rigid acting from young Leonardo and practically the same plot line! Boy meets girl, girl already engaged or to be engaged with a fatal divide, in R+J it's the family divide (Montigues and Capulets), in titanic it is the barrier between the rich and the poor, the only reason this desecration of Shakespeares work (Romeo and Juliet + Boat) sold is because it had special effects involving the sinking of the liner 'The Titanic', THAT was it's USP, what else is there? The story? Already covered that. The acting? Hell no. A girl in one of my classes at college was praising the writer on such an imaginative story: "" How did he come up with the idea of creating this story of a large ship sinking AND adding love."" Now don't get me wrong, I wouldn't base this review on one silly girls remark, but if you reverse that, there was no creativity in it, the only creativity involved was part of the tarnishing of the past of REAL people who were on the boat, the man who shot himself for killing a passenger, IT DIDN'T HAPPEN! He gave his life to save others... Where is the conscience of the Hollywood pigs who tainted this guys past? The best part of this film was the end, and I love this film solely for the sweet consolation of the absolute poorness of this film that is the drawn out death of the character that is Jack Dawson.",Titanic

1931,vehemency,A good movie that's a bit flawed,8,4 February 2006,"This was, undoubtedly, a huge box office success, and being so Hollywood-dominated, it's just natural that people have such polarized opinions. A few years after the movie's release, it became quite fashionable to skewer the Titanic as an example of the over-hyped, huge budget Hollywood films with questionable acting and a cheesy story. But now it seems to have come full circle. A larger percentage of reviewers have come out to express their positive feelings, perhaps after re-watching Titanic, and reassessing the big picture of things.Of course, the criticisms about the storyline are 100% true. The plot is cliché and predictable. Nonetheless, James Cameron takes it and executes it impeccably. It matters not that a story has been retold for the hundredth time; a good storyteller can still captivate his audience. Here, I believe lies the magic. Titanic is a film that takes these clichés and weaves a beautiful quilt out of them.Titanic does not pretend to be innovative, at least in terms of the storyline. However, considering its execution, great (at the time) CGI, and majestic rendering of that great vessel, I believe this should be a consideration for the IMDb top 250. For those who have a bit of time on hand, why not take another look at this slightly dated blockbuster? Focus on the riveting atmosphere that the director projects upon the screen, and refrain from digging in on its flaws, and this should be an enjoying experience.",Titanic

After the camera pans across her bedside photos and then across her face (where you can't tell whether or not she's breathing), it travels back down to the Titanic where we only see the people who died that night. I've asked this question to a number of people, who didn't seem to notice, or care... I don't know which. But Leo told her that night in the water that she wouldn't die this night, this way. That she would be an old lady warm in her bed. So when they showed her as an old lady warm in her bed and recapped her life thru her bedside photos, I concluded that she died. Did she?",Titanic

1937,winterman93,the boat sinks,1,7 January 2006,please...it is a three hour sinking boat...yeah we feel bad for the people who lost their lives..that is why we're making millions of dollars to exploit their death...great job Cameron...why not do a 9-11 film now? or the 1906 earthquake? The funny thing is that I have to come up with ten lines about how a boat sank....wasn't that the dilemma that James Cameron had? Trying to fill 180 minutes for a boat that sank just as fast and make it a little more interesting than the horror that it was? How can we sucker punch people to go to a movie that is simply tragic so that we can remind them to avoid pleasure cruise boats from the early 1900s especially around icebergs...trudging slowly around an obvious and uncreative storyline....blah blah blah..I wasted 6 hours of my life with Titanic and Pearl Harbor...monumental days in American History destroyed in 6 slow torturing hours...why not rip my fingernails out???,Titanic
1938,robnrich05,Still Amazing,10,19 November 2005,"TITANIC in it's time was the Ship of Dreams. She was big, beautiful, and luxurious. When James Cameron made this film, he did a very good job however, there were some things that were just not accurate in the history of the Titanic. One scene is where there is an Officer of the ship who salutes his comrade, and shoots himself in the head. That never happened. However, the order that was given women and children first was accurate for sure.The other scene is where Capt. Smith goes into the bridge house while it's under water, and truth is, he disappeared. No one seems to know what happened to him during Titanic's final moments.Cameron did an excellent job in selecting a superb cast of characters. Decaprio and Winseltt were just amazing as Jack and Rose. You can feel their passion and desire as they learn about each other. These two characters were flawless, believable, and kept the film going forward for the most part. Kathy Bates as Molly Brown was awesome. She portrayed her very well. The character was very out spoken, told it like it was, and spoke the truth, but yet Brown's mannerisms were more like a rough man rather than a lady.For the most part, the Titanic itself in the movie was very believable. It was as if you were on the ship itself. I never realized just how big she was, but from what I saw, she must have been a very big ship for sure. Cameron did his homework very well. He must have studied every inch of the Titanic when he went down to look at her. The first class area was very exquisite,and WHite Star Line must have pulled out all the punches to make their passengers feel welcomed.Everything from the departure in Souhthampton to her final moments was truly horrific but it certainly caught my eye. The effects of the Titanic breaking up was very well done, and accurate. It just holds your attention as the remaining passengers face death when Titanic went down. It was just heart breaking.This movie was well done, well thought out, and well planned, Everything from the story line to the characters to the special effects was well worth the 10.50 I paid for. TITANIC is the all time movie of 1997. When you do watch it, have a box of Kleenex ready to use! I guarantee you will have to have them.Out of ten pop corn boxes, this movie gets a + 10!!!",Titanic

Now i look back and wish i had watched it properly in the movies because when i watch it now it brings me to tears, not a lot of movies can do that too me i have only cried in The Notebook, My Girl and the lion king.Its not just the death scenes that get to me its the romance how to people that just meet can end up soul mates, they would die for each other. Kate Winslet plays Rose so well, and well we all know Leonardo was made for acting you can see it in ""whats eating gilbert grape"" & ""Basketballer Dairys"" they make this movie so enjoyable and wonderful to watch.

1942,mtewson,Most over-rated/hyped movie of all time,5,2 January 2006,"I'm guessing that the cost of this movie made it imperative that it succeeded at the box-office. Hence, virtually every paid movie critic in the world giving this a thumbs up, when you know that some of them did so with both arms having to be tied behind their backs. We all know the story, what happens to the ship, how many die, what band members were still playing as it went under and the water was bloody cold. Yippee!!!! The plot is thick with predictability, loose on plausibility, and low on imaginability. The acting was OK, nothing more. True the effects sequences were pretty impressive and if you'd heard Celine Dion's song for the first time, you may have liked that also. 1,200,345 Times later and it doesn't half get on your Bristols I can tell you. This film had to bring in the money or many companies would have gone under. So, the Hollywood publicity machine worked harder than ever before and got the job done, creating never before seen box office returns. Personally, Id sooner have gone and watched Costner's ""The Postman"", or Tommy Lee Jones in ""Volcano"", equally bad films but at least people were honest enough to say so.",Titanic
1943,Kainoknight,Pretty dense but I'm sure some chicks love it.,3,30 January 2006,"The ultimate chick flick that is disguised by giving some nudity. The acting is so so. Dicaprio tried to save the movie for us guys but the plot was too weak for us dudes. Love stories can only do so much for the male department. However, even the background characters look good. The costumes were well done to look like 1912. Still the plot wasn't there. The actual sinking surprised me to death. Didn't see that one coming. Basically Romeo and Juliet on the Titanic except that was a good story. Dicaprio showed a few flashes of brilliance but that wasn't enough to save the three hours of nothing. The only thing that is worse than this film is how sadly overrated it was. A lot of good movies came out in the nineties and some of them deserve a second look. This one however doesn't. It's replay value is extremely poor and no guy I know would want to watch the whole thing more than once. A real boring film.",Titanic

Anywho, The first half starts off slow, the second half did make me cry-but still! that doesn't mean its a good movie. Anywho, the end sucked-period. beginning was okay-not the best thing ever.

The movie depicts the expansive gap between the rich and the poor during the era it was filmed and the drástic difference in lifestyles of each. The acting was genuine and it immersed you in the relationship and developing love of the characters. The ending is a moment you never forget as it leaves the love story behind and puts you in the dire circumstance those passengers faced before their time of their death. I have never finished this movie without tears in my eyes.",Titanic
1949,weezer_2005,The greatest epic ever?,10,25 April 2006,"Many people think this movie is average, largely because it has been at the front of hundreds of jokes about the ""pathetic"" romance in it. Personally i totally disagree, the romance is how it should be. If you are going to watch a romantic film, you need it to move you and make you fall in love with the characters. In this film, you don't connect so much with the characters but you can see how the characters connect with each other which is something else entirely. If these people who were insulting this movie were to sit down in a theatre and watch it alone, i am sure that they would love it, hell these people were the ones that were raving about it in 97! The special effects are like nothing seen before on film. They are amazing, for the time the special effects were very ahead of its time and even now to this day, the effects are just as good. To be honest, the effects look far more realistic than the effects in movies like Die Another Day. You cannot spot any CG in the entire movie except for the iceberg which is obviously CG.I am really not surprised that this picture was so great because it had an amazing director at the helm who knows the subject well. It is believed that king of the sequels director James Cameron researched Titanic for 5 years before creating this masterpiece. And it paid off with 11 Oscars to match Ben-Hur's record, which was later broke by Return of the King.James Cameron is known as a perfectionist for his work and this is no exception, everything from the boarding of the ship to the boarding of the lifeboats is sublime and extremely correct. It is very faithful to the actual disaster and even the cutlery was of the exact nature of the real 1912 cutlery on board Titanic.I give this a 10 and highly recommend this for anybody, young or old. Not only because it has romance for the girls but has action for the guys. Part of the reason this did so well is because has something for everyone. I am a guy and i was brought to tears watching this movie.It is meant for the big screen so try to get hold of a High Definition TV or a projector as its the best way to be viewed.10/10 25/04/2006",Titanic

And Titanic is about an old woman's memory about a huge famous boat and her lover she met during her endless trip to America. The first time I watched this film was in my early age.

Leonardo, of course, is hot hot hot! I visited the Titanic Exhibit in Orlando and that completed the experience that the movie brings you. Being a girl, I cried through pretty much ALL of this movie. I wish that every girl could find a guy like Leonardo (in this movie at least) that would love them as much as he loved that girl. I can't really say anything bad about this movie because it's just too, too, too great. If you haven't seen it, which is unlikely, then go to Blockbuster right now!

When I first saw this movie, I was aboard a Cruise liner in Asia pacific with my friends and fell in love with it completely. I must say that we did try all the stunts in the movie on the cruise as well. ;) When the movie released in 3D, I could not give it a miss at all. The drama and the story grips you completely when you watch it in a theatre. You get sucked into the movie right from the scene when older rose starts with her story of titanic. The sound and scenes makes the movie a memorable one. no wonder it won 11 Oscars.Thank you Mr. Cameron for the wonderful experience in 3D.",Titanic

1960,thegup55,1.8 billion and counting.....,10,27 March 2006,"Of the top 10 grossing films of all time, Titanic is #1 and Mel Gibson's 'Passion' is #10. The remaining 8 are either sci-fi, action hero, or fantasy flicks. I find it ironic that the the only non-make believe movies on this list are about two of the greatest historical tragedies to befall mankind. The real triumph in Cameron's rendering of the sinking is that he put a human face on it...as did Gibson re the Crucifixon. This is a timeless movie that I can watch again and again. My only complaint was the casting of Dicaprio...Somebody like Matt Damon would have made a much better Jack Dawson. The rest of the casting was impeccable, especially Capt. Smith, Mr. Andrews and Ismay, Molly, Hockley and his manservant, Rose's mother etc, not to mention Ms. Winslet, who in my opinion is in the same category as Meryl Streep in terms of range and fearlessness as an actor, not to mention her luminous beauty.",Titanic
1961,imflyingjack415,"Beginning with a treasure hunt, ending with a heartbreak...",10,29 March 2006,"Titanic has been known as one of the biggest movies of all time, and is definitely a classic. From the time when you see the famous shipwreck, to the very end, you will just stare at the screen in awe. This is my opinion of the movie, and I know that probably many people would disagree with me. What more could you ask for in a movie? Suspense, romance, some comedy between the conversations of Jack and Rose, drama, almost every genre fits it. When you first see the drawing of young Rose that is found in the safe of the wreck, you are confused as to what it might be, but find it beautiful just the same. Hearing that old Rose is almost 101, you might find it hard to be realistic, but by the end of the movie when Jack is making Rose promise to go on with her life without him, you believe anything this movie has to throw at you. When Rose Calvert begins her story, you are shown a young woman who is sick of her first class life, and wants to ""break free"" from her chains. A man named Jack Dawson is also shown playing a poker game, and attempting to win the third class tickets that were bet on the ""ship of dreams."" Of course, Rose and Jack meet and there is an instant connection, and half way through the movie, you want nothing more than both of them falling in love. After taking Rose ""flying"" out of her caged life, Rose and Jack do fall in love, even thought they've known each other for only a matter of days. While all of this is happening, you forget all about the dreadful iceberg that will eventually separate Jack and Rose physically for good. Just when you get attached to their story, the ship soon begins to sink. After watching both characters almost lose their lives in more than one way, you eventually witness Jack giving up the one space on the floating board so that Rose can live in place of him. A tear-jerker every single time you watch, the music alone will just make you start to tear up. Though the tragedy was unbelievably depressing, and leaves you with a heavy heart for days afterward, this wonderful record-breaking Oscar winning movie will have your heart. Now, almost 9 years since the movie came out, I still love it, and I know that it is a movie that I and many others will never tire of, for Titanic is one of the best films of all time!",Titanic

I have always been fascinated with the story of the once, ""greatest ship of its time"". DiCaprio and Winslet were amazing. The movie came together beautifully. The special effects were mystifying, and put you almost on the Titanic. This movies touched my heart as I watched what those people went through, it was heart breaking. This truly was a great accomplishment of James Cameron and all the cast and crew. I think that this movie has showed people more of what happened that night in 1912.

I have to admit that the effects, choreography, art direction, and overall feel of the film are excellent, but is the movie all that it's made out to be? Of course not. None of the actors deserved nominations, the screenplay was predictable and at times even cheesy, and it is overall, just a movie to watch once, twice at most. The fans of the movie, in my opinion, watched it for the sake of Dicaprio. For all those who have seen it, listen to how I think it racked in the most money: The people seeing it opening weekend were pure Dicaprio fans, they then told their friends that it was actually rather good, so more and more people start seeing it, and are brainwashed by the money it's making, and confuse the money with the film. Then there are the anti-Star Wars fans, going to see Titanic just to beat Star Wars money wise, even if they hate it, and it is no where near the best film of all time. That's just my opinion. Don't get me wrong, I liked it. I liked it enough to place it this year, only behind Good Will Hunting, LA Confidential, and As Good As It Gets, but not enough to remember next year, and I sincerely think it doesn't deserve the money it made.",Titanic

1965,markonmovies,An exercise in tedium,5,31 October 1999,"Technically flawless, Titanic is a movie without soul. Not one single shot is intended to draw the audience in and make viewers want to continue to watch. We know that expansive, historically accurate movies that use fiction and an unusually long amount of time to make their point can work--The Godfather, Godfather Part II, and Gone With the Wind, among them. We also know that historically accurate movies that use fiction don't have to be unusually long to work--From Here to Eternity and Reversal of Fortune, among them. Unfortunately, James Cameron and his backers learned nothing from these examples. Instead, they have shown us that it is possible to be extremely successful financially with a movie that is without soul or purpose. As I watched this lethargic, painfully over-designed product (it's not really a movie or a ""film""), I was reminded of movies like Top Hat, Bringing Up Baby, the Grapes of Wrath, and Rebecca. These wondrous offerings and many other of the most entertaining and memorable movies are freed from such concerns as historically accurate sets, costumes, and props by relying on the obvious talents of their performers and crews. For every ""period"" picture that cannot match the perfection of its design with laudable acting, writing, and directing (Ever see the Bostonians or the Great Gatsby?), there are (thankfully) a good number of ""period"" pictures that surmount any shortcomings in design accuracy with otherwise skillful storytelling and acting. I really wanted to believe that Titanic could break through the barrier of a recreated ship with an interesting and entertaining story. Alas, the ship (at least the one built for the movie) proved to be more impervious to true emotion than the icy Atlantic.",Titanic
1966,kal-el,Titanic is an overrated film with little to offer anyone not infatuated with Leonardo DiCaprio.,5,22 November 1998,"When I entered the theater to see the film Titanic, I expected to see a romantic epic reminiscent of Doctor Zhivago, or even The English Patient. Unfortunately, all I saw was a $200 million film about social inequality a la Romeo and Juliet.  The plot was so thin and the characters so underdeveloped that one longs for the ship to hurry up and sink within the first hour and a half.  The boat itself was not even that amazing.  Although the sinking scene was semi-exciting, it got old seeing the two characters run through hallways, only to be met by a door.  About half an hour could have been trimmed from the film by removing these ridiculous scenes alone. It still amazes me that this film received so much recognition, not to mention the amount of money it took in at the box office.  The only explanation I can offer is that apparently twelve-year-old girls have nothing better to do with their time and money than ogle at the mediocre acting abilities of the girlish Leonardo DiCaprio.  The true atrocity of this film is not merely how mediocre it is, but the fact that it won the Best Picture Oscar when such films as The Sweet Hereafter and L.A. Confidential truly deserved it.  This is not to say that I hated this film, but that it was not by any means the best film of 1997.",Titanic

It was incredible in every detail.  I thoroughly enjoyed every minute, and this will be in my DVD library forever.  I only wish they made Gold Standard DVD, this would be a classic masterpiece, of which I would proudly display (and watch) to serve as a reminder just how well done this movie is.  I didn't realize the true story of what happened, until the events unfolded in this outstanding film.  This movie gets my vote as perhaps my favorite movie of all time.  Certainly, you cannot deny, its impact on the entire world, because as of the date of this comment, its the best selling movie.. by at least double.. of ALL time.  I would say, its the best overall movie, even though I myself prefer Sci-Fi/Fantasy movies.  This movie moved me, and I, even being a man, am not afraid to say , stirred feelings I never knew I had.  I was angry, upset, frightened, and shocked all at the same time.  This movie is perhaps the only movie to date , in my mind, worth the title: Number 1.",Titanic

1971,kevdave,You've got to be kidding.....,1,5 September 1998,"The most impressive thing about Titanic is the awards, audiences, and money that can be raked in by such a crummy movie.  Of course, Titanic does have truly incredible special effects and good cinematography, but it seems as if Mr. Cameron said to himself, ""I have a trillion dollars worth of sinking ship special effects, now what can I do to pad it out to 195 minutes?""  So he sat down for about 20 minutes and wrote the story and the screenplay.  Unfortunately, the story takes much longer to tell than it apparently did to write.The story is about first class passenger Little Girl Rose  trapped in a young womans body and engaged to a wealthy ogre  and third class passenger Little Boy Jack trapped in a young mans body, traveling the world to draw pictures of nude bar prostitutes  who incredulously meet on board the Titanic, fall almost immediately in lust, Little Boy Jack draws a nude picture of Little Girl Rose,  the two have a romp in the back seat of a car, the ship sinks.As pathetic as the story is, most of the other components of the film are just as bad.  The dialogue is so contrived and sappy it seems like something one would expect from a 50 cent paperback romance.  The music is just as sappy, mostly orchestrated snippets of that wretched song by Screamin Celine.  The acting:  it seems the actors realized the stupidity of the dialog they were reciting and just wanted to get the heck out of there.Finally, over an hour and a half into the movie, the ship hits the iceberg. In the next hour we have the only 30 minutes of the film worth seeing.  The special effects are tremendous  its as if I was  actually aboard the Titanic.  Unfortunately, by the time the film got to this point, I was so bored out of my skull it was difficult to see this as anything but a bunch of special effects.  Until then, there had been no emotional ""hook"" in the film, so by the time it got to all the drama of the ship sinking and desperate people panicking and trying to cling to their lives, there was nothing to feel.The two really good things about Titanic are, after what seemed like seven months in the theater, it finally ended, and once it comes out on video, insomnia will be a thing of the past.",Titanic

Wrong, I just love a good movie. I think James Cameron did a great job, and I praise him on his work. As for the actors & actresses, they were all wonderful. They could not have picked a better actress then Kate Winslet (Rose), she did a wonderful job. There was one character I did not like and that was Cal (Rose's Fiance), but Billy Zane played the character well and he fit the image that I would have of that kind of man. I liked how the movie showed the wreck of the Titanic after all those years and then Rose came into the part and started telling the story. If it would have went straight into the story I don't think that it would have been as good. It sort of gave the movie a little twist. The detail was good. There was a few places were you could tell that the ship was computer animated, and the part with the dolphins you could tell it was not real.

1975,charles-18,Titanic is not a classic,1,17 December 1998,"For a movie that had so much money wasted on it, I found the (very expensive) computer animation to be quite bad. Have you watched Jurassic Park recently, and thought ""hey, that dinosaur animation looks really fake now!"", when it looked impressive the first time you saw it? -- I think that is how the animation in Titanic will look like in a couple of years.You will notice that the computerised people in the film have perfectly spherical heads, they waddle rather than walk, and they all waddle in exactly the same way. It's a bit like watching a synchronised dancers in a music video. Because the computer animation scenes were interspersed with live action scenes, I found the jumps between the two jarred a lot. Lighting and fog levels did not match very well between the two. Computer animation technology is capable of much more than Titanic demonstrated.In a few years, Titanic will look cheap -- but just like Jurassic Park, people went to see it for the special effects.

They did... but not everything is so impressive in this picture.A lot of money were spent on a great view of the ship and it's catastrophe, so we could see the best special effects ever made in cinematography. The great direction of James Cameron made us see how it all really happened. Horner's music was wonderful, it couldn't be better. The press of the picture was great. But real cinema lovers did not see the attributes that characterise the REAL movies.The story is not too special and original, lots of romantic love stories were made before, some were more impressive and special than this. I know that we can't require the originallity from the story like this, based on a real facts. But I think the acting of Kate Winslet and especially Di Caprio and Billy Zane was very weak. The dialogues were very poor too, it were one of the worst dialogues I have ever heard.There is no best movie of all time, but Titanic can't even pretend on it.

Kate was so wonderful & so was Francis Fisher! People thought Leo was bad, he did his best that the role could allow. People also say that the script sucked. Well what could have been done to make it better--add more complex words?? And, if there were different actors, how could they make it better? Love is love. And True Love stories are corny, that's how it is. I've defended Titanic in most of the ways people have complained about it. I wanted to show the other side to the arrgument.

I've now seen it 3 times and that's not the easiest thing to do when you've got a newborn baby!! 3 hour movies kind of cut it fine between feeds! But I managed because Titanic is a sublime film experience and I've never felt so touched by a movie; in fact 3 and a bit hours wasn't long enough and I hope there will be a director's cut because there is a fair bit of important historical facts and features omitted but I read they were left on the cutting-room floor. I'm no Leo fan and at first it seemed inappropriate casting him with Kate Winslet, who was wonderful as usual, but 2 viewings later it seemed right and I was into the love story side of it. Winslet and DiCaprio work well together and are believable if you can get past the notion that he looks 15 and she seems so ""mature"" when in fact I think they are about the same age. The special effects, direction, editing and especially the costumes and sets were truly awe-inspiring. I could go on and on about the good features of the film such as how close some actors looked to the characters they played e.g. Capt. Smith, J. Bruce Ismay, Thomas Andrews, Margaret Brown, Ida and Isidor Straus and more. The only downside to Titanic was some sections of the script that were corny and ham-fisted but no film is entirely faultless and I think Titanic deserved all the Oscars it received and, contrary to popular belief, it is not only Leo-maniacs who give this movie it's box-office success and seeing it doesn't turn you into one either. There are many scenes from Titanic that will probably stay with me forever; this film grabs you and won't let you go. The class stereotypes were unfortunate and we don't get an accurate picture of the way many people behaved during the sinking; Cameron seemed to ignore the fact that many first-class men willingly gave their lives and the way First Officer Murdoch was portrayed was disgusting. But apart from those few things it is a triumph for James Cameron and everyone involved in creating Titanic.",Titanic

1981,Tuqan,An insult to the ART of filmmaking and to filmgoers,1,2 October 1998,"This review was made by my daughter Dana (York Univ., Toronto, Canada).Titanic:  A Double TragedyI had initially refused to see Titanic on general principle, not wanting to participate in this blatant celebration of Hollywood's most devoted suckers. However, out of sheer boredom perhaps, I finally consented to the pleas of my friends and paid the eight Dollars to attend. Little did I know that what awaited me in that darkened room was worse than anything I could ever imagine. In case you've been asleep for 2 years, Titanic, directed by James Cameron, mildly resembles a love story that supposedly took place upon that ill-fated oceanliner, the Titanic. The premise for the film is typical. Guy meets Girl. Girl is from higher social class and will not succumb to Guy's advances. Finally, after much personal anguish and deep thought, she gives in to the overwhelming emotion, and together they fight the oppressive opinions of the people around them. It is by no means an original story line. We have all seen this numerous times before with alternate settings. What actually happens in Titanic's three agonizing hours, against the backdrop of that historical tragedy, is the most ridiculous waste of money I have ever been victim to. The characters in the story were, in a word, ridiculous. I sat back watching in disbelief as the one-dimensional personalities produced tears in my fellow viewers. Leonardo DiCaprio, that pre-pubescent heartthrob of seventh graders everywhere, took on the role of the Good Guy. Similarly, there were others to fit the roles of Good Girl, and of course, Bad Guy, all of whom overacted to an embarrassing extent. With the aid of the outrageously simple dialogue, the ""star"" cast acted not unlike an elementary school drama ensemble. I sat through this film in a constant state of pain as the film gradually deteriorated. ""It has to get better,"" I thought to myself, dodging the wet tissues that were being passed through the audience. Titanic, unfortunately, did not get better. Despite the film's numerous attempts at evoking emotion, Mr. DiCaprio's nauseating performance and Ms. Winslet's complete lack of talent were the only things that managed to raise goosebumps on my arms. Riding the bus on the way home, I again tried to find any salvation for the film. I temporarily consoled myself with thoughts of the technical aspects. The special effects involving the sinking of the ship were mildly amusing. However, that too was quickly obliterated when I realized that most of the effects had been created using miniatures and an over-sized bathtub. I continue to hear people rant and rave about how great Titanic was, only confirming my suspicion that the majority of the North American population are, like the film's heroes, shallow and easily amused. Furthermore, I was sickened as I recalled the numerous Oscars that were handed out to the man responsible for this disaster, Mr. James Cameron. Many are convinced that he is a wonderful human being. After all, he refused to accept a salary for his work. I believe that he did this out of shame rather than personal sacrifice. Naturally, the fame and recognition he received as a result of this film makes all his future endeavors instant hits. I cringe at the thought. Everyone behind the release of Titanic should retire immediately as it is an insult to the art of filmmaking and to filmgoers throughout the world. Titanic, its cast, and the billions of Dollars wasted on its production need to be studied very carefully. Scholars everywhere need to forever use it as an example of how to make a film void of interest, originality, and self-respect.",Titanic

1983,BigJohn-2,"TITANIC is a wonderfully moving story, and has effected me more than any film ever has.",10,29 September 1998,"TITANIC was a life changing experience for me, even as cliche' as it may sound.  I went to see the film just by chance.  I had not heard much about it at the time, and just went to see it because it was a new film that had just opened.  It forever changed my life.  I've now seen it 14 times in all, 12 a the theatre.  Each time I see the film it is as if I am really aboard the great ship, and I feel what the characters feel.  James Cameron has done a magnificent job of expressing the emotions and feeling of each character, and it never ceases to touch my soul.",Titanic
1984,DJB14,Best movie ever!,10,7 October 1998,"This is the best movie I've ever seen. It's very historically accurate, they even used the same type of wood that was on the real Titanic. I don't know why some people don't like this movie. Every time I read a bad comment I ask myself. ""Do these people know anything about the REAL Titanic"" or ""Have they even seen it"". The actors were great. As well as the special effects.",Titanic
1985,Pete-57,Seen it all before!,4,1 November 1998,"While the effects and acting were good I couldn't help but be disappointed by the cliched story.  Poor boy meets rich girl and everyone, from the boyfriend and his henchman (over-the-top villainy if ever I've seen it) to the snobbish mother, is desperate to stop them.  Come on - the ship is sinking and there's time for a chase scene complete with shooting! We've seen this story a hundred times, only the set (a good one at that) was different.",Titanic
1986,theedge,Disappointingly Overrated,1,4 October 1998,"I was impressed with detail they put into the facts of the circumstances and the detail to the time period.  But the dialogue was cliched and predictable. Plus the acting was not at it's ""best"".",Titanic
1987,Bluey,How can you hate this movie?!?!,10,4 October 1998,"I find it hard to relate to those of you out there who hate this movie.  Bad acting?!  Terrible dialogue?!  Well, we're all entitled to our opinions I suppose, but for me, this film is a wonderful experience!  It's there to be enjoyed, hate it if you must, but you're the ones missing out.Is it perfect?  No, its a bit tricky to make a perfect movie, but if you're so fussy that you're looking for all the errors in a film, that you can't ignore them, then again, that's your problem.  Personally, I loved it, I'll forgive the few, and what I consider to be minor errors, and look forward to owning it :)",Titanic
1988,Juliet-7,Disliking popularity,9,7 October 1998,"I'll start by saying I loved this film.  I thought it was beautifully done and I loved Leo and Kate (everyone should go check out Heavenly Creatures, by the way).  But everyone has heard why this is such a good movie.  I do want to say that if it weren't such a popular movie, it probably wouldn't be criticized nearly as much.  People want to hate what is popular and they'll find ways to scrutinize this movie to death.  One of the main problems seems to be that Cameron brought a fictional story to the Titanic rather than one of the real ones.  Yes, but then you can say that about most war movies- or books, for that matter!  I don't think the real people of the Titanic were ignored at all.  We got to see the different classes and ways of life in a combined story.  Or people say he didn't spend enough time on Molly Brown's character- but how long do you all want this movie to be?!  If I was going to complain about anything, I might mention that the second class seems to have disappeared from the ship.  But again, the movie is already over three hours long. I know that feeling when you seem to be the only one to know about something or someone and then it becomes ""household"".  I've always been incredibly interested in Titanic and knew all those random but real stories that all 9th grade girls now know.  I have loved Kate Winslet since Heavenly Creatures was made and Leo since I saw him in Basketball Diaries.  Remember when no-one knew who either of them were?  But this really doesn't matter. My point is let something be popular without feeling abliged to stand out and hate it.  Just because it is mainstream doesn't mean it is bad.",Titanic
1989,pimpim,Titanic - A Triumph in Filmmaking,10,10 October 1998,"Titanic is the most emotionally powerful and visually beautiful film created in a long time. At last we have a film that gives us raw emotions and romance and lets us dream of true love, passions, beauty and tragedy without any of the usual sarcasm and ugly bitterness and disillusions of modern films where love and tenderness are ugly words.Titanic lets us escape and experience something greater andmore important than the usual self-preoccupied and self-analyzing plots of the modern film. It is a complete return to the bigger-than-life characters and drama of the old classics and its huge success proves that people are desperately searching for a sense of tenderness, warmth and true love that this film succeeds so beautifully to convey.The emotional impact of Leonardo DiCaprio's and Kate Winslet's performances is almost unique in its strength and through their extraordinarily beautiful and expressive faces we suddenly stop being ourselves and become one with them and their love and passion, devotion and sacrifice.Visually this is one of the most stunningly, breathtakingly beautiful films ever made. The colours are brilliant and luminous, and there is an unusual shimmer and depth to the light which adds to the beauty.James Horner's music is truly haunting and profoundly romantic. It masterfully blends with the visual drama and enhances the emotional experience in a unique way.The performances of every actor and actress are excellent, and there is no weakness anywhere which is unusual and which typifies an outstanding film. In my view Leonardo DiCaprio's performance is grossly and unfairly underrated as his acting is intimately connected with Kate Winslet's to the point where they are artistically inseparable. He should clearly have been nominated for an Oscar alongside Kate Winslet and their contributions to cinema history should have afforded them both with Oscar statuettes, which went as so often before to inferior but politically more correct performers.However, the ultimate reward is of course the fact that Titanic will always remain one of the greatest and best loved films in history.Caroline FridSWEDENcaroline.frid@malmo.mail.telia.com",Titanic

The emotions she shows in her facial expressions and pitch and tone of voice are something to behold. Billy Zane as the dastardly Cal is also quite superb. Well done to all concerned on the movie, and I wait with eager anticipation for the Directors Cut on Video.",Titanic
1993,sgreech,Wildly overrated,1,23 October 1998,"Horribly flat characters, laughably pathetic dialogue.  Only the impressive big budget scenery saved this from being a total shipwreck of a movie.",Titanic
1994,ylan25,Good job on a bad script,1,24 October 1998,"Nice movie, superb directing, excellent effects, good enough acting(Kate was OK, Leo is the best actor among those least talented beautiful people). An empty script specially designed to show off its special effects. That sums up the most overrated film in history. I will resist commenting on the overplayed soundtrack.Love lovin schoolgirls and horny boys who enjoy goggling at Kate will certainly adore it. The Oscar judges are probably retired businessmen who know nothing about movies. Heard they rarely accept female members(chauvinist they are) into the panel of Oscar judges. Thus they rate Titanic as best pic, under pressure of their junior school daughters.",Titanic
1995,Rufus-15,Contrived Tosh!,1,13 November 1998,What a load of hype about nothing very much. The people who made this movie were so engrossed in special effects and massive budgets that they neglected to notice the cliched story line and consequently missed the opportunity to highlight the real tragedy of the event - that a few minor differences in circumstance would have altered the result of that fateful night entirely. What a waste!,Titanic
1996,he-2,Water over the bridge,7,31 December 1998,A boring traditional disaster-romance. The computer animations are pathetic and the characters cut out of Baywatch. The only notable feature was the aging actress in the lead role- THAT*S ACTING!,Titanic
1997,rjs-5,The film presents a distortion of the facts.,1,1 January 1999,The movie portrays First Officer William Murdoch in a way that is totally contrary to the truth but instead suits a particular propagandist position. This is both immoral and grossly hurtful to Murdoch's descendants. No wonder the Chinese government recommended the movie to their people. It amazes me how modern American filmakers seem to delight in tearing down the society and values they have grown up in. The film is an insult to all those passengers and crew who showed such tremendous courage in the face of a horrific death. In reality it was NOT two 90's style teenagers who were the heroes of the Titanic.,Titanic
1998,tehmer,Why was there no place on the shelves for DiCaprio?,1,5 January 1999,"Poor DiCaprio. First he falls in love with ugly Kate Winslet, then he can't convince her to let him on the saving shelves in the ice water. But what is the worst: the computer generated fly over the hopping titanic animation (man, we already had 1997, and we could have done better simulations!) under the squeaking voice of Celine D.

2000,Monty-Python,The most unbelievable true story someone ever made up.,1,22 January 1999,"When I went to see this film, I was expecting something truly great.  I was sadly very disappointed.  The characters were generally poorly developed, leaving me with a sickly sweet after taste, rather than a feeling of sorrow or compassion. Whilst the talent gathered (Winslet, Zane) hinted at true acting ability (they have provided far better performances in other films), the script is lacking in anything other than schoolgirl Mills and Boon. The technical effects have obviously been done to high standards, as the boat looks impressive, but that is where it ends, as the man-child DiCaprio slaughters the basest of emotional lines, as makes the romance seem cliched and below par. If you absolutely must see this film, see it on the silver screen, as the lack of grandeur which is displayed on the small screen leaves only the ""acting"" to behold.",Titanic
2001,nellie-4,Cut an hour and a half out and this could be a great film,5,27 January 1999,"I think I must have seen a different Titanic to everyone else. This version lasted about 4 years, had comic book characters and an ending (no, not the boat sinking) that could be seen from miles away. All in all, it's not a bad film, the effects are breathtaking and almost make it worthwhile sitting through the sentimental claptrap that drags on and on throughout the rest of the film. Billy Zane can be seen reprising his earlier role as a comic book character ably assisted by David Warner hamming it up big style. The only actors who seem to take this film seriously are Leo and Kate.The problem is that after about 2 years, all the character development is done. Kates marrying Billy for the cash, Leo is the skint but lovable type and all the rest do what they're supposed to, then it just goes on and on and on until 18 months later when the boat starts to sink, then this film finally starts to live up to the hype. Then after sinking and freezing its back to present day for a few weeks and then we get to go home again.Sorry I can't join the gushing praise for this film, but, no pun intended, the rambling middle 2 hours left me cold.",Titanic
2002,Rose-50,The best movie ever done,10,30 January 1999,"I loved the film "" Titanic "" and it wasn't just for Leonardo Dicaprio's pretty face. It was for everything. For the pretty love story, for the story of Titanic, the ship that was unsinkable. The wealth, the poverty, the ignorance, the despair, the trust, the hope, the love... Great film of James Cameron with great interpretations so much of Leonardo Dicaprio as of Kate Winslet.",Titanic
2003,mnwild,Sinking romantic thriller.,3,7 February 1999,"If you cut out the first two hours you might have a decent movie here, but most of the movie is wasted on the stupid love story and not on the true facts of what actually did happen on that night.

If there wasn't such a media following to this so-so movie, I might've actually enjoyed it. But, however, my expectations were high and the movie simply did not deliver. Not worth wasting 3 1/2 hours of your life on.",Titanic
2005,Dill-4,Acting was subpar,9,26 February 1999,"You know why Leonardo DiCaprio wasn't nominated for an Oscar for his role in the movie?  Simple:  His acting was not very good, and at times it was the equivalent of some of the performances one might see on an after school special.  That will keep this film from holding the title ""Greatest of All Time.""  I still say that Titanic was not even the best movie of 1997.  That should have gone to ""LA Confidential.""  But that argument is for another time....",Titanic
2006,GregC-2,Get rid of Kate and Leo and the first two hours,1,15 March 1999,"The technical execution of the ship sinking is entertaining. The rest of the movie is worthless dribble.I can understand why an adolescent girl would sigh over some dumb little twerp proclaiming his love with his dying breath to a woman he has known for two days. However, anyone over the age of 15 who doesn't have to suppress a gag reflex at the idea has no standards at all. There was no chemistry between the leads. The writing was atrocious. Cameron failed miserably to develop any empathy for any of the major characters. The movie sank long before the ship did.A bad, bad, bad movie. The worst movie to win Best Picture since Forrest Gump. And that took some doing.",Titanic
2007,BJNeuman,George of the Jungle II,2,4 April 1999,"Yes, I said it. George of the Jungle: The Sequel. Piecing this movie apart, what you have is the Brendan Frasier version of the old television series. Taking away the sinking of the ship (which James Cameron truly did backstage), analyze what is left. You have a rich girl engaged to a rich man with whom she does not wish to marry. That girl, our heroine, falls in love with the hero, who happens to be of a lesser social status. The heroin's mother wishes for her daughter to marry the rich fianceé only for her own good, and tries to convince her daughter not to marry the hero. The evil fianceé continues to try to kill our hero. What happens, in spirit, at least, the hero and the heroine end up together. Sure, Jack dies in Titanic, but that is truly the only difference between t plots.George of the Jungle is by no means a better movie. I didn' like either of them. However, if you want to spend half the time in front of the screen, pass over Titanic and go for George.",Titanic
2008,Elwyn,Two thumbs down,1,14 April 1999,"The craze was out. Everyone was talking about it. Girls swamped the theaters to see it 7,8,9,10 times. ""Best movie ever"" they said to I finally rented it. I have to say that I found it sadly lacking. It was a historically inaccurate movie about a girl that cheats on her fiancee. I find it sickening that the American people find such great pleasure in a movie like this. There was no action at all in the first 2 or so hours of the film; Leonardo stood around and looked cute and Kate stood around and tried to look cuter. The ""evil"" character in this movie was completely one dimensional showing us no other qualities of himself except that of some ogre which makes you wonder why Kates character ever got engaged to him anyway. When her romance with Leonardo began she never before, during, or after suggested to the Ogre that they should ""just be friends"" she decided just to skip that and start steaming up some windows. And why did people see it so many times? Did they expect the ending to change after the eleventh viewing? Were they hoping to see the boat not sink? I think it could have been a wonderful movie if they had based it more on fact such as ""Gettysburg"" or ""Braveheart"". The true story of the Titanic is filled with action and sorrow and loss enough that they didn't need to ruin it with a revolting play of a Cheater, an Ogre, and a Pretty Boy that brought excitment to an otherwise boring and uneventful voyage.",Titanic
2009,ludwig-13,It was NOT the greatest film of all time(not even best of Cameron),6,20 April 1999,"I know there is a million respones already written, but I just can't help letting some readers know that this is not by all means a great film. There was one moment that caught my breath.  I don't believe J Cameron intended this scene to be though.  It was when Jack said he was from Chippewa Falls (WI). Since I am from WI, this line made me enjoy the movie for a few seconds. If that was the only scene I liked, well this film will be and is in big trouble.Ok there are a few things that weren't bad.  1. Kathy Bates (should have been nominated for the statue) 2. a likeable theme in music.  3. good opening scene(it was pretty spectacular)Now, the rest I have to say are for the Titanic freaks.1.  This script was beyond pathetic.  Cameron trys to be touchy by having two completely different people fall in love.  True, they could have been made for each other, but the way Cameron incorporated all the scenes were hideous. The script of the present time is decent, but the story telling part is horrible.  I couldn't get rid of the feeling of numbness in my butt. 2.  Acting was for the most part not good (except Bates).  Winslet is the worst.  She could not get me to feel for her.  Her jumping scene is simply boring.  Leo- was better, but still did make me feel like he is in love with her.  And please, Leo can't lift her when she fell over. Maybe that's why we never saw them together in the scene. 3.  The graphics- ok it was pretty neat how they sank the ship.  But the scenes never made me feel like I was on that ship.  The boat was very fake. Plus the water looked like a giant swimming pool.  And the sky looks like something I drew in kindergarten.  Just look back at other movies. Jurassic Park had much better graphics. 4.  Music-  I am a music major, and James Horner is not a composer I admire. He developed a fairly interesting theme.  But he never went anywhere with it.  All the music seemed to be in the same mood. Finally, story.....it was simply boring.  No one will ever beat Spielberg or Lucas in telling a story.Cameron should have stuck to his T2 or T3.  Stay away from other genres. All the films nominated in 97 were better than Titanic.  I thought Amistad should have won it, but that's my taste.  But to see people saying Titanic was a great movie......I JUST WANT TO PUKE",Titanic
2010,Lisy-2,A stunning example of the idiocy of The Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences.,1,7 August 1999,"When I saw ""Titanic,"" I thought it was vaguely entertaining, and the costumes and special effects were beautiful. However, I didn't leave the theatre discussing it with my friends, and I didn't feel or think any differently than three and a half hours earlier. Then I heard it had been nominated for numerous Academy Awards, including Best Picture, and I was outraged.Not surprisingly, this big-budget piece of recycled Hollywood trash won, even against three of its wonderful competitors, ""L.A. Confidential,"" ""As Good as it Gets,"" and ""Good Will Hunting."" The first has plenty of interesting plot twists and amazing performances, the second gives a fresh and cynically humorous look at romance, and the third helped ME realize some things about myself, at least.  ""Titanic"" did nothing like that.The screenplay was something that had been done dozens and dozens of times before, and as far back as the Elizabethan era, as the ludicrous, 'Romeo & Juliet'-esque romance will prove. The performances, even by such normally-wonderful actors as Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, and Kate Winslet were either dry, or over-done. I imagine that if one had to 'listen' to this movie  rather than have the dialogue and music (which is pretty at parts, but just a repeat of many of Horner's other scores) accompany the pretty images, it would be completely unbearable.",Titanic

Rose: You shouldn't be asking me this! Jack: It's a simple question, do you love him or not.I'm sorry you Titanic fans out there, but the movie didnt move or touch me at all. I rather preferred ""Jerry Maguire"" as a romantic movie or ""pretty woman"". Also the casting wasn't good. Di Caprio and his hair, as well as speech irritated me, and I think Winslet, although she is a gifted actress, is too ugly for the role. A wasted chance for a good movie.",Titanic

When Jack won the tickets and everything else it was just wonderful. I also like the parts when Rose and Jack talked...also in the beginning. It was funny. The part when Titanic sank...well tht was the longest part...about 1.5 hours...I think it was a little too long. I don't know. I did not really cry at all, but i was really sad. The very end of the movie was good too. Did Rose die at the end? I am not sure. I guess we'll never know. The movie all together was just great. Looked very realistic. Good job, Cameron. I think if we would have more of those kinds of movies it would be so much fun. I really don't know what to say...it's hard to explain what I feel about it. You just have to see it. Oh well i guess everyone already did, but if you did not where have you been? Anyway i think it was a really good movie and I really recommend it. :)",Titanic

You could tell that Winslet, DiCaprio, Stuart, Paxton, Zane, and everyone else really loved working.  At times they referred to Cameron as a ""tyrant"".  I can see why.  Working on a movie that has a budget more than some countries have to spend is pretty difficult.  Cameron squeezed emotion out of monotone Leo and proper Kate.

2016,Stian-6,Effects vs. Story,3,29 June 1999,"First of all, I must say that I didn't have much expectations to this movie in the first place, but as a dedicated movielover I've promised myself to see as many movies of any kind that I possibly can. The plot in the film is no news to anyone, and DiCaprio's arrogant and childish acting is an enormous disappointment after seeing him in films like Whats eating Gilbert Grape?. Kate Winslet is excused, cause she's probably what they could afford after budgeting the stunning effects and DiCaprio. As for the effects, they're of course outstanding, and the sinking sequence is probably some of the most impressing I've ever seen.To sum it all up; first half hour good, the middle is THE most boring ever, and the end is great, technically. If they've made this a documentary instead, and dropped the lovestory, it'd been a movie worth while, but as it turned out; I'm sorry, but the thumbs should be anywhere but up.",Titanic

It really sank, but none of the plot was true.  The movie was a disgrace.  It used a historic tragedy to get people to watch their subpar movie.  The movie was completely predictable, and the basic concept has been done over and over and over again.  I am ashamed that audiences flocked to a movie that just wasn't very good.

One brief example (one of many) of the stupidity that fills this movie:  Everyone stuck in the icy Atlantic water at the end of the film is a popsicle in 10 minutes.  Yet Leo and Kate are able to swim, wade, and run through thousands of gallons of that very same water while trying to escape from the lower decks of the ship, without so much as a shiver.  If you're going to make a movie that purports to be realistic and historically accurate, try to at least put a LITTLE bit of thought into the screenplay, please.This is to say nothing of the wooden acting, wooden dialogue, wooden, unmotivated characters... the only thing not made of wood was the damn boat.

The directing is excellent, the acting is sober (Kate Winslet show us that she is a talented actress) and then comes the entertainment section in which ""Titanic"" is ""the king of the world"".

2026,boyscout-4,AWESOME MOVIE,10,31 December 1999,"It was a great movie, a heart felt perspective on a heart felt tragedy. The movie was awesome.  Very few historically accurate movies can be this good, it's worth all 600 million it has brought in at the box office.",Titanic
2027,aracelivera,Greatest Film ever?,6,8 February 2000,I've just read some of the readers comments on this and it amazes me how this film can receive so much praise!Technologically I would say the film is very good and this is perhaps its strongest point - the fact that a film has been made which visually shows the grandeur and impressiveness of Titanic and conveys in a relatively effective way how amazing it would have been in 1912.Having said that - does anyone really care about the fate of Kate and Leo in the film ? Their acting is terrible... and I think they are both extremely talented - this may be because of the difficult circumstances surrounding the shoot or because of Mr Difficult himself - James Cameron. The plot is non-existent... how can you invent a story around the sinking of the Titanic?. And there is far too much inconsistency throughout for a Director who spent millions on real crystal chandeliers and real china 'Titanic' plates.....It was a travesty that this beat LA Confidential at the Oscars when LA Confidential has brilliant acting by all concerned and a plot that actually keeps you,Titanic
2028,abidnadeem,"Excellent, keep you involved",10,15 May 2003,I think this was an excellent movie and I have seen it many times. Every time you see it you don't get bored and you see it with more interest. All the charters have been beautifully and artistically presented. The movie gives you a picture of the fateful ship that was unsinkable but finally sunk in its first ever journey.,Titanic
2029,billstein22,Bah! a titanic mess,1,11 February 2001,"What the hell is this?? After Cameron's classic films like Aliens and T2, how did Cameron make this? Ok to start off, this movie was long. 2 hours too long. If they hadn't had the whole love story plot, this movie wouldnt suck. The action/adventure of this movie is actually quite fun, but the whole rich girl meets poor boy love was thrown in there to attract some audience. Whoops, they attracted a bunch of teen girls who have nothing better to do then watch the same movie 40 times a week. The acting in this is just terrible. The talkative old lady was just annoying and stupid (if youve seen the movie you know what i'm talking about). So the movie should really have been built around the action/adventure, which i think it was originally supposed to be. Which brings me to my next point: How did this movie win best picture? Well, there are 2 reasons for that. #1, it came out in December and the movie critics who chose the movies are all too old to remember movies from the summer (despite LA confidential)..#2 obviously because the movie made the most money ever in the box office. To any guy who wants to impress his woman friend, dont rent this movie because your lady will dig Leo, not you. Please avoid this movie if you havent seen it, and if your going to ignore that anyway, then i hope you have a fun time because this deserved the golden globe for best comedy/musical.",Titanic
2030,azziggy,"Titanic, almost the greatest movie ever made.",9,5 February 2000,"In 1912, the Titanic was a technological triomph, and it is again today.  James Cameron is one of the greatest people that ever lived, he is right up there with George Lucas and Jim Hensen.  The completion of that movie was nothing short of sheer greatness.  The dramatic camera effects all the way to the computerized extra's, titanic is almost the greatest movie ever made. Now, the reason I say almost, is because there just had to be a Nudie' scene, to ruin it for everybody with standards.  I myself would not even see it until I was able to purchase it and have it edited, but it was immensely worth the trouble of getting it edited. Now the movie would not be near as great without the strong effort on the soundtrack side(JAMES HORNER).The music fits the movie more perfectly then any other movie I have ever seen in my life.  James Horner is probably the greatest composer the lived",Titanic

2032,m-stoel,A great movie about the Titanic,10,25 April 2000,"I liked the movie very much, because Rose and Jack were played very good. The director made very good use of the existing theories about the Titanic, like how it sunk, how everything was, etc... On the end the movie was very exciting, but some parts before were funny and also impressive. This was a movie that made great impact to me compared to other movies. So over all: A great movie, I would recommend it to everyone",Titanic
2033,beezlebozo,"Titanic, redefining the word ""mediocre""",1,25 April 2000,"Your average American loves Titanic. This is why they are considered average. This movie is unimpressive in every possible way. From the bland acting to the bland script this movie is, well, bland. The script, by the way, was co-written by James Cameron and the captain of the girl's tether-ball team from the local junior high school.The only extraordinary thing about this film is the special effects. A boat sinks. A really big boat. It looks really really real.           But it's still just a boat sinking. Not that exciting.All in all this is a movie geared towards illiterate 12 year old girls.",Titanic

When Jack started commenting on the dolphins, he left, saying: ""If this is the quality of dialogue, I'm going."" That about sums it up, really. It was a good idea, and a terrible delivery. In want of severe editing, better writing, and more convincing actors, Titanic was probably the most disappointing movie I've ever seen. With a well-respected cast, (Kate Winslet, Billy Zane, and Kathy Bates, to name a few) 14 Oscar nominations, and 11 wins, I was expecting a beautiful tale of star-crossed lovers and ill-fated voyages. And it could have been that. But unnecessary scenes, uninteresting dialogue, and wooden performances hindered what could have been an amazing movie.",Titanic
2035,drhogie,Arguably the greatest cinematic-historic film of all time.,10,20 July 2000,"It's a shame that this movie received as much backlash as it did.  This movie showed exactly what type of effect a dedicated force can have for a movie, and a dedicated force is exactly what James Cameron was with this film.The acting was quite wonderful.  DiCaprio did a wonderful job as the happy-go-lucky poor boy.  Winslet was wonderful as the rich girl trying to find a way out.  Zane's acting was so perfect for the villian that I can't stand to watch him in any other movie, not for his acting, but for how brilliantly he played the evil rich snob who will use his power to get whatever he wants.  Yet, all of these acting jobs were overshadowed by the boat itself, as well as it's tremendous supporting cast.  The humanity that the actors and actresses brought to each character was amazing.  I am still brought to tears every time I watch the musicians playing on the deck of the sinking ship.Cameron literally brought the old oceanliner back to life.  The attention to detail of every part of Titanic was greater than in any other movie I have ever watched.  The cinematography was outstanding.  The entire sinking of the ship was brilliantly done, and completely hammers home the fact that so many people died that didn't have to, simply from humanity's own bullheadedness that we are invincible.A wonderful movie that people need to stand up and recognize as one of the greatest movies of all time.",Titanic
2036,Pipe Man,Good in spite of Leonardo DiCrapio,2,26 July 2000,"I really enjoyed almost every scene and the overall movie, but I feel they ruined it by using a trendy teen-heart-throb/heroine storyline to tie it together.  It was a great historical portrayl of an infamous tragedy, and a good tearjerker.

I couldn't belive how fake kate and leo were, they were rubbish. I spent half the film laughing at the awful script ""i'm on top of the world"" was perhaps the funniest line. The story itself was the strangest thing about the film, we are apparently being told the film through rose's eyes, yep, but half the time we are seeing things that rose didn't see herself.?.

2039,reynald-2,Incredible,10,3 November 2000,"I almost wish this film was not as financially as successful as it was so that some people are not prejudiced by its mainstream appeal for they would miss not only a great movie but an experience.This is one of the rare romantic films that I felt 'worked'. The dialogue from beginning to end was top grade. Sure a few cheesy lines may have slipped here or there but for the most part, the dialogue that delivered the story transcended that of any romantic film I have seen to date.Anyone that has seen the movie knows this was not about a boat that sank but rather the love of two people (Jack & Rose) that was so strong which over shadowed the danger they faced. Both willing to die so long as they were together for they would have no reason to go on with out each other. This is the Romeo & Juliet of the 20th Century.If I am to find a love at least half as strong as that of Jack & Rose, I would consider myself extremely lucky.",Titanic

Then they mixed in two actors who cannot act to save their lives, made them read a horribly written script, and finished off by adding three hours of unnecessary footage!  DiCapprio and Winslet are painful to listen to - they have virtually no skill in line delivery and the writer wrote things that no one in real life says!  They spent way too much money on special effects (and that's all it looked like, obvious computer graphics) instead of using some sort of skill and REALLY recreating the ship.  If you take away the choppy computer graphics, the horrible script, the leading duo, that horrendous teeny-bopper love/sex story, and Celine Dion,  you are left with an amazing group of scenes when the ship sinks, the incredible make-up work on the oceanic casualties, and the indisputably wonderful Kathy Bates which is the cast's only saving grace.  It may be a cult classic for lonely love sick teens, but I would avoid this one like the plague if I were you.  Instead, write a list of all the other things you could do in three hours and save yourself the nauseous feeling you get every time DiCapprio and Winslet try to act.",Titanic

2044,buehnec,A real life story with a fictional twist,10,13 March 2019,"It all starts off with a 100 year old woman named Rose DeWitt Bukater telling her story full of love and loss. The story takes place on the luxurious, but ill-fated R.M.S. Titanic, with young Rose boarding the departed ship with the upper class passengers and her mother. Meanwhile, a traveler and an artist named Jack Dawson and his best friend Fabrizio win third class tickets to the ship in a game of poker. The story explains a seventeen-year-old noblewomen falling in love with a kind, but poor artist.It is a real life story, with a fictional twist. The movie shows two completely different worlds and how they connect, putting aside the labels and showing the purest of love. A great lesson for the real world. Jack and Rose spend their days together experiencing and learning new things from each other. The tale starts off with young Rose convincing herself to jump off of the ship due to her life situation of being forced to marry a self involved man that only loves money and himself. Jack spots young Rose leaning over the rail and tries to convince her saying ""I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. Which is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here."" His attempt to help is successful and is invited to a meal as a result of his heroic act.The whole story with the movie is iconic. It has greatly impacted then and is still now. It has made a major impact in the movie industry, and is still evolving. It's a story being told while also being lived at the same time. Now the ship lies at the bottom of the ocean with its remains only able to last another 15 to 20 years, the film is here to keep the memory of the titanic alive. Great success and great things have come out of this movie for many different reasons.I recommend this movie for anyone from teens/young adults to elders. The historic event tying to a beautiful, but fictional story. It's been over 105 years and people are still fascinated with it. So if you are looking to watch a love story that never fails to make you cry, or maybe also a movie with a historic purpose, then I highly recommend watching the Titanic.",Titanic

There is no way that ship that large metal ship that large could have been sunk in by a measly iceberg, it's unrealistic. why are there even icebergs? we're not sailing through Antarctica. if The boat was hit by the iceberg it should not have sunk, how are you going to tell me in the beginning of the movie that you were on in unsinkable ship just to show me three hours later that it did indeed sink and killed many people I feel deceived by this movie. Completely unrealistic. horrible.",Titanic
2047,dostuaricardo,Power of Love,10,14 May 2019,"Extraordinary love story and very touching heart. it's one of the best films I've ever watched. I don't know how to explain my feelings. oh god, this film makes me shed tears. even now when I watch this film again, it can't be felt not to shed tears. it is rare for me to feel this kind of feeling that is even difficult to express. I have never been bored to watch it repeatedly and even the power of the film hasn't diminished in the slightest, even though this movie has been released for quite a long time. maybe there are only a few films in this world that make the audience take part in feeling the story in this film.When I first watched this movie, I cried and didn't know what to say, I thought it was an amazing film with a storyline that couldn't be guessed and there were not only sad parts but also parts that could make laughter so that this film not flat and not boring. Until now it was the best film in my life, no single film could match it.
This film for me there are many grooves so we have to really pay attention from the beginning so that no part is missed so we will feel the intention to convey this film. I think this film has been very perfectly made with technological sophistication which at that time was very extraordinary. I think this character by Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet is extraordinary, they are like being able to be interconnected and truly like love stories in the real world. young couples who face complicated love stories in the middle of a different background, full of struggles and challenges that must be faced but with the power of love all can be passed.I think this will be the best film of all time that will never be forgotten.",Titanic

And I did see it - and I loved it. It's an amazing movie, the actors are great, the director is great and the set was built so realistic.The story of the rich girl meeting the poor boy is great, and as you learn more about them, you find out that emotionally it's the poor boy that is rich and he has so much to give to the rich girl. Though it has a sad ending, I think that's what makes it such a great movie.The performances of Leonardo DiCaprio as Jack Dawson and Kate Winslet as Rose Dewitt Bukater are excellent. They are so good at it, and you just get the feeling that you are there. Also the performances of the other actors such as Victor Garber as Thomas Andrews and Kathy Bates as Molly Brown are of first-class.I love this movie, and I can see it over and over again.

2052,Jedi_Master_Siri,One of the Great Overrated Films,6,16 July 2002,"Possibly one of the most overrated films of all time. Mind you, I am not a Titanic hater. I saw the movie, and I cried, and was moved. The sinking scene was heartbreaking. However... For all the hype, the movie isn't that high quality. A sadly cliched story, sub-par acting, historical inaccuracies, and gratuitous use of plot devices is hidden under beautiful scenery, costumes, and great special effects. It's your depressingly average story of rich girl meets poor guy, runs off, parents disapprove, evil boyfriend lurks in background. Quite possibly the best proof of the weak script is the fact that, as you watch the boat sink, and as all the characters' fates come together, it is not Jack and Rose your heart goes out to, but rather the random extras running around, falling off of things, and being trapped insidee the boat. In this, to some degree, there was success. One of the most powerful images in the movie is an old couple just lying on their bed while water floods in beneath them. Again, this movie isn't awful. It's actually pretty good. But it certainly didn't deserve the eight million Academy Awards it recieved. Costumes, yes. Special effects, sound editing, sure. It was all very well put-together. But in the categories of character and plot, where it matters most, the movie falls apart. Even the more recent Pearl Harbor, also hailed for its messy plot, is well-acted and powerful, and you at least LIKE the characters. The powerful performances hold it together. Next time you're at the video store, I'd reccomend Pearl Harbor over Titanic any time. However, Titanic still is not to be missed. It does have its good points, points which make it very much worth seeing.I rate a seven out of ten",Titanic

It got me thinking about the movie and, as it was raining that day and that and I had it on tape at home, I decided to watch it. It's only then that I realized how an amazing movie it was. Despite the wonderful visual effects and the beautiful music, to me the most amazing part, that made it a worldwide success, was the storyline, the romance.

From the sad romance to the actual horror of the sinking ship it is definitely the best. What makes this such a great movie is the different geners. There is a love story that many teenage girls might like and action that may take the interest of many guys. Who ever you may be there's always a part in the movie that anybody would like, but it all fits with the love story between Rose and Jack. Many people love to hate this film, but it doesn't make it a bad movie the box office number says it all. yes, there are people that say otherwise, but there are still many people that still enjoy watching the movie. I myself probably watch it once every two weeks yeah, its a lot, but what could I say, it never gets old and every time I watch it it gives me the same feeling it always has as if its the first time I've ever seen it.

Now i was only 6 years old and i wanted to see the movie really bad, but my parents were like ""no it is not a movie for you of your age""so I'm guessing early 2000's i was at a friends house and i looked thru the VHS's and they had Titanic right there so i begged and plead if i could see it and they are like ""ok, but beware, it is 3 hours"" so we popped in the tape and watching for 3 hours. And at the end everyone, even the boys, were crying. It was the most AMAZING movie i have seen, even today. Right from the beginning to the sinking. The Special FX were great and still cant be passed today. It is my gavorite movie of all time and i have become obsessed with Titanic every since. My mom also told me that my grandmas mom was on it so which made me interest go REALLY up.There is no other movie like it and i don't think a movie will surpass it until another 25 years.

I love the movie titanic and of all the special effects. It's a love story with true facts of the titanic. It's my number one movie of all times. But Jack shouldn't have died in the movie. GREAT JOB! Even if this was a true story.....it would have had so many more viewers if Jack and rose died together...old or young......It was all put great together and an excellent touch to it that can make you cry for several hours. I also love how all the ladies wear their gowns like they would have in the early 1900's.......But what makes the movie even more of a love story and a sad story is when rose dies in her warm bed like an old lady like she promised. and she dies having a dream of her getting married with Jack Dawson.,Titanic

2063,varunsingh-26714,One of the best movie ever made,10,20 September 2019,It's 2019 and I still watch this movie sometimes and I am pretty sure that people are gonna keep watching this movie for the next 50 years and while watching this they will still feel that same emotion that they felt when they watched this movie for the first time. This movie still in the top 3 of the list of highest grossing movies of all time even after 22 years.,Titanic
2064,RavenStarViudez,Must watch if you're looking for a great movie!,10,23 October 2019,"A great epic romance and disaster film indeed, Titanic the movie. Titanic is a 1997 American film directed, written, co-produced, and co-edited by James Cameron. Incorporating both historical and fictionalized aspects, the film is based on accounts of the sinking of the RMS Titanic, and stars Leonardo DiCaprio (Jack Dawson)and Kate Winslet (Rose Dewitt Bukater) as members of different social classes who fell in love aboard the ship during its ill-fated maiden voyage.This movie is not just showing how two persons fall in love but it also shows social issues like the inequality that has been the focused from the very beginning and at the end of the movie. First from how money generated that ship like those who paid lower stays at the bottom part of the ship and those who paid more stays at the top part of the ship. Why does it matter? Because they have thought that the place at the top is more comfortable and safe like if ever the ship will sink, they will not be the first ones to sink. At the last part, it shows how the rich ones were saved by the countable boats they have used and the poor ones not treated well then died in the sea.This movie is truly a good one because it is not only about love but also about some facts and true-to-life happenings like how people are treated based on their social status. That is considered as Marxism. But like other movies, this one also has bad sides like the noticeable mistakes in the cinematography and it has scenes that are not appropriate for kids.Overall, the movie was good for people who wants to watch a movie that is double purpose and for those who love watching dramas which makesal them cry. But as far as I have observed, this movie is really well known and can be known by most of the people living when 1997 came and until present. And I suggest this movie for those who love handsome guys like Leonardo DiCaprio <3",Titanic
2065,punkrock_princess2000,Very Good Film!!!,10,31 May 2006,"I am sure that this film was top of the worlds highest grossing films at the cinema for a reason. Rose (Kate Winslet) is a wealthy woman on the ship Titanic, when she meets a young man called Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio). Jack is a poor man who immediately falls in love with Kate. It is your typical love story, which is exactly why I love it! It mixes tradition with originality and never falls too far away from the main plot. If you haven't already seen the film, i advise you to go now! There are some deeply emotional parts to the film, which draw you deeper to the storyline; the storyline is not hard to follow, yet it is not too simple. The tragedy at the end of the film will always make you cry, no matter how many times you see it. It is best to see it not too young, but in your early teens as then when you are older, when you watch it, it will bring back the memories when you were most emotional, thus causing a better experience. All in all, i would always rate this movie a 10 out of 10!",Titanic
2066,dawn_edworthy,Titanic a wonderful movie tearful and heart stopping,10,5 June 2006,This film is an excellent film and a very good costume drama i absolutely loved this film from beginning to end Kate and leo i think are fantastic actor and played the part very well unfortunately with tragic consequences it made me cry at the end and made people think about the class differences and those poor people who died on that ship. Titanic a wonderful movie tearful and heart stopping. One of the best scenes is when jack and rose go dancing to Irish music and rose gets tipsy when she balance's on her toes i thought that must of hert her feet. this film get 10 out of 10 from me a must see movie i would recommend it to anyone.,Titanic
2067,kidwai,"The ship was 'Unsinkable', so was their 'love'",10,17 November 2002,"TITANIC ......  the tale of the unfortunate 'unsinkable ship', the tale of love that became 'unsinkable'The direction of James Cameron (also writer of, also director 'terminator(,2)', and aliens) gives an everlasting effect to the legend of titanic. tough most of the people would rather fancy that the movie is unacceptably long, and so did i, sitting half an hour into the movie, but then the next i think i knew was that the 3:14 hrs were already over. I would say that the movie was extremely well paced, providing the viewer with the exact of everything, the magic, the love, the pain, the tragedy, the wealth, the poor, sincerity, faithfulness, .... everything.
This movie received the highest ever box office collections in world cinema history, i would add that no doubt the movie was good enough to force the viewer to watch again, but the credit for pulling the masses into the theater for the first time goes to the voice of Celine Dion and the composition of James Horner, the classic 'my heart will go on'.
Tough it would have been better had the movie been shorter, but if they ask me to re-edit this movie, i think i will only end up adding another half an hour to the movie, because it is not just a movie but a euphoria, a magical experience that i will never want to leave, its like living in Alice's Wonderland, leading to the desire of having a loving and a sincere (and of course beautiful) Rose of your own.It is hard to believe that this masterpiece cannot find its place in IMDB 250 ratings. My ratings for the movie are 10/10, and thats because there wasnt an option for more than that.",Titanic
2068,ilkim_ertas,My review,10,18 October 2019,"Titanic is an award winning romantic film. The film was directed by James Cameron and came out in 1997. It is set in a ship called Titanic. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are playing the leading roles.
Main character Jack Dawson won a ticket for Titanic at gambling. And he met with Rose DeWitt Bukater who she came from a rich family in Titanic. Jack fell in love with Rose. But the ship hit an iceberg and Titanic began to sink.
This movie has a wonderful story. I have watched it more than one. But each time i never lost my excitement. It will always be my favourite movie.",Titanic
2069,izzyymotleyy,Titanic....my favorite movie of all time.,10,22 June 2020,"I usually do not write reviews for movies, I'll rather just rate them. But this film is different. I NEED to talk about this film. I've loved this film ever since I was 6-7 years old, and I haven't stopped loving it since. Titanic is a masterpiece beyond levels. When it comes to the first half, were introduced to a romance/love story, which is just the heart of the movie. The film then needles through the past and present with breathtaking transitions. Then the second half of the film is basically a disaster movie, which some of the most heartbreaking moments introduced to film. Everything is so believable and so atmospheric. James Cameron is so talented as a director and as a writer when it comes to this film, his talent was very much noticed. This film is just....so masterful and so well made. Words can't express how much I adore this film, but it's just my favorite and I wish more movies were this well made in today's field.",Titanic
2070,RogueMarie,Wow,10,9 June 2006,I think this is a very good movie and I got it for my 8th birthday! I really enjoy it and hoped they would make a sequel to it. I think a sequel would be very enjoyable! ^_^ My favorite part is when Jack and Rose are running from the old man. That part is always fun.Also when Jack takes Rose down to the bottom to the party where they have lots of fun after the stuffy dinner with Rose's icky fiancé. I also think it is so sad when the old rose throws her diamond into the sea with Jack. I always cry when Rose lets go of Jack I'm the ocean after he dies. :( I enjoy this movie very much and recommend it to those of you who haven't seen it yet. So go and rent/buy it today!,Titanic
2071,Jhornet,greatest movie ever,10,15 June 2006,"I think this is one of the best movie of all times. when the subject of favorite movies comes up and the Titanic is mentioned many people snicker. but you know that when they watch the movie they cry with the rest of them and are just embarrassed to say they did. but the other other half of are saying how they love to watch it Me, personally, i cried through the whole last hour of the movie. i can watch this over and over and there is still a power in it. Also, the acting is great. Leonardo Dicapreo and Kate Winslet are perfect for the parts. the scenes don't drag on and on as they tend to do in longer movies. the special effects are amazing. during the sinking scene i was amazed. it was so realistic. This is definitely my favorite movie and would recommend it to any person who hasn't seen this movie yet.",Titanic

2073,foxy_ah,I Love Jake Dawson,10,10 June 2006,"I voted 9 in Titanic because Titanic is my favourite movie because it is a mixture of romance and Death and that proves that love is more powerful then death and even though Jack (leonardo Dicaprio) died in the ocean of coldness she still lived to carry on his name. So that why i love Titanic because it is s mixture if different things and that LOVE REALLY IS MORE POWERFUL THEN DEATH!!!.She lived on, on that very day those words that Jack (leonardo Dicaprio) said will probably stay with me for Eva these are the words That were said...NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS YOU MUST STAY ALIVE AND NEVER LET GO BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO LIVE AND MAKE LOTS OF BABIES AND ALWAYS REMEMBER ME. That night Jack Dawson died.",Titanic
2074,xbittersweeto5,A real tear Jerker,9,4 July 2006,"I'm a thirteen year old girl and when I saw this movie about three weeks ago I fell in love with it, its now one of my favorites. I've seen it 5 times since and think it is a great movie to just watch on those sad rainy days.Its a real tear jerker when I saw it I cried the whole ending.. about 45 minutes of the movie. Its long but when your watching it your just so into the movie you don't realize how long its really been. Me and all my friends love this movie and even a couple of my guy friends love the movie too. Its a great movie for anyone to watch. My little sister who is three watched it with me and loved it too. This movie was based on something that really happened with sometime that could of and that really makes it more interesting to watch because of the fact this might of been how two lovers lives were changed and the ending is a perfect way to finish the story. This was the cutest movie I've seen.",Titanic
2075,trangell-02621,Accurate to history and very moving,9,15 December 2019,"This is truly one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has so many little details that relate to the actual history about it. Even some of the things people say relates right to what actually happened. It does have some minor flaws like how the ship is built, but other than that, I thought it was fairly accurate.Also, the director really connects you with the characters. With Rose, you feel bad for her that she is forced to marry this terrible man and with Jack, you feel bad for him because he keeps getting stereotyped into a ""poor man."" You can tell that they have such a connection right away as well. Towards the beginning, when Rose is on the railing of the ship, Jack comes in and saves her, which brings them closer together. They have an unbreakable bond. At some points in the film, I did get a little teary-eyed from how Rose was treated by her fiancé and mother. It was so unfair that she could never make her own decisions. The same goes with Jack too, when Rose's fiancé and mother would discriminate him because he didn't have nearly as much in his pocket. These examples help you grow fond of the characters and help you feel what they feel.This film is fairly historically accurate and a timeless classic.",Titanic
2076,coolnerd_12,"The movie is great. The acting, well,",7,21 June 2006,"I first saw this movie when I was 5. The special effects were amazing.Based just on them I would have given the movie a Ten out of Ten. The thing that was pretty much horrible was the acting.Don't get me wrong,Kate's acting was the best,but Leo was how did he say it, 'orrible. I have seen him do so much better than that. His dialog was cheesy, he had no emotion and to top it all off, he didn't make the character his own. It was pretty much what a high budget fast paced action,chick flick, was about, glizt and sparkle trying to cover up bad acting. But lets be fair, its Titanic. so I give it ******* out of **********",Titanic
2077,jesusvonne,epic!!,10,15 December 2019,I avoided watching this movie for a long time just because it was so popular and I thought like the society is overreacting about it but no I watched the movie and I absolutely loved it even I rewatched the day after that day. Amazing!,Titanic
2078,Eshlonn-1,Brilliant romance masterpiece.,10,27 November 2006,"This movie was a brilliant romance masterpiece. It has everything a good movie needs. Humor, plot, and most of all: Drama. I wouldn't go as far as to say it's the Greatest movie of all time, or even the greatest love story of all time, but it is definitely within the top 10. Leonardo DiCaprio shows great drama and incredible acting as the part of ""Jack Dawson"". Kate Winslet is as evenly good at the part of ""Rose DeWitt Bukater"", and the narration from Gloria Stuart is incredible. This movie scores a 10/10 in my book. From the start of the movie with the uncovering of the titanic, to the overwhelming sadness of the end, brilliant acting plays a huge part in this movie. The actors were great, the screenplay was great, and thus, the movie was outstanding.",Titanic

2081,drjwaynemc,One of the best movies of all time....,10,10 February 2007,"James Cameron crafted a masterpiece with his Titanic. Surely to become a classic in the same class as Gone With The Wind, the Titanic has something for everyone. The movie is filmed on a colossal scale and the special effects are stupendous and very believable. This 'romantic' documentary of the Titanic tragedy underscores humankind's vulnerability to nature, even in the light of new technology. The Titanic and its sister ships were the latest technology of the times but were no match for the unforgiving forces of the sea and the subtle shortcomings of men. The touching intertwined story of Rose and Jack further add to the meaningfulness of the overall movie. The performances of Kate, Leonardo, and Billy are top notch. Be prepared to want to see this one over and over again. You'll notice new details each time! Congratulations to the cast and crew of Titanic!",Titanic

It was never on the Titanic.I should imagine that with the curse that the diamond had it could have been told to have been on the boat. Hence the sinking of an unsinkable ship. However, what the hell lets all believe this wonderful love story that isn't really true.If you perform a googly search on the internet you will find out the truth about the hope diamond. Not one word about the titanic or any steamy sex scene with some teenage lovers.I hate to be a stickler for the truth especially when I enjoyed the movie so much.",Titanic
2084,hk-84771,Timelessly and universally appealing,10,9 February 2020,"A spellbinding, moving and awe inspiring motion picture.Even to be able to successfully make such a big scale movie is a feat in iteself. Particularly, the second half, showing the ship sinking is a great filmmaking achievement.Besides, the film offers an audio-visual treat by virtue of its great settings, beautiful costumes and wonderful background score.But even with all these features, the movie would have been superficial if the story wasn't poignant enough. Thankfully, the love story is one of its strongest aspects. I think there are two reasons why the love story is so touching and iconic:1.)The idea of watching the romance between two charming young lovers on the grandest, most magnificent ship in the world is fascinating.2.)On top of that, knowing that it's not too long before the ship hits the iceberg and starts to sink,thus separating the two of them forever.The ending is particularly remarkable. There are a few scenes towards the end which add great emotional depth to the ill-fated love story:The 101-year old rose dropping the diamond in the ocean, the camera moving through pictures of young rose while the old rose is asleep and finally that magical last scene- capturing the essence and spirit of the whole movie- in which the ship becomes alive and the two lovers reunite.In a nutshell, Titanic is a great motion picture which is timelessly and universally appealing.",Titanic

2087,shanesmw,I Can't Stop Watching This Film,10,18 July 2006,"When I first saw Titanic I was nine years old and just wanted to see the movie that all the critics were buzzing about. I had no real idea of what the true story of the movie would be; I merely assumed it was an action movie and that the CGI was amazing. Well it was filled with action and the CGI was amazing but what amazed me further was the story itself. I've seen Titanic in full probably about 10-15 times and most of them are recent viewings. I don't know exactly why I cannot stop watching this film but I do realize now more than ever why it is such a great film. There are flaws of course but give Cameron a break, he pulled off a film not many directors would've even dared to attempt.Titanic is the best film ever made simply because of the way the story developed. The story from the very beginning had a deeper meaning than just the sinking of the ship itself. It touched on every issue plaguing mankind such as the conflict between good and evil, trust, marriage, the role of women in society, money, and love. While it may sound very bias towards the upper class, Titanic reveals something that many movies try to but never fully accomplish. This is the connection between money and evil. Yes, the famous saying is, ""Money is the root of all evil,"" and Titanic did an astounding job proving it. Monetary issues affected just about everything in the movie. It was the reason behind everything that happened. Rose would have never been forced into marrying Cal if it weren't for money, more lower class passengers may have had a better chance of survival if it hadn't been for money, and Lovett would've never found Rose if it hadn't been for his lust for the diamond (aka money).Not only was the movie outstanding for its development and plot, the acting impressed me. Every actor amazed me except for Amis (played the role of Lizzy Calvert) but then again, her lines were limited. DiCaprio surely fooled me (I initially assumed he was just hype) and Winslet stunned me beyond belief by playing her role to perfection! Billy Zane will forever be remembered for his performance as Caledon Hockley and he is on my top 5 list of all-time favorite ""bad guys."" I could literally rave about the acting forever, it is unmatched, the best overall acting performance by any cast. As for Celine Dion's ""My Heart Will Go On"", it's not a song in particular I would like but it was a great pick for the love theme.Titanic is one of the few movies to ever make me cry and I'm embarrassed to say that because I do not cry often. However, I'm glad that this movie is as tear-gouging as it is because it helps to relay the message of Titanic and it magnifies the faults of humanity better. Every time I sit down to watch Titanic, I tell myself I will not cry at the final scene...but I always end up lying to myself. I applaud Cameron and everyone involved in the making of Titanic. Every time I see it, I become more and more addicted to it.",Titanic

2089,vemiewer246,Why this movie is the best,10,30 November 2006,"Let me start by saying that how could you not like the script? SO WHAT if they pretty much never call each other darling or honey...but SO WHAT!!! Rose was in LOVE with jack. And he made her a free spirit..not a boxed in girl trapped to a boring life. She didn't want to have class by having to say ""darling"" like she did to Cal. But anyway, the movie has the best special effects, and ending ever. This end was the only movie that has made me cry. If a movie can make you cry emotionally, how can you say it has a bad script? Exactly. The acting is excellent also. This movie gives an excellent feel for the people's lives lost on titanic. It is as if you can feel the disaster happening. I love this movie. My all time FAVORITE MOVIE!!! (The music by James Horner is alos VERY good-My Heart Will Go On in particular.)",Titanic
2090,Mia-302,Titanic Review,8,10 April 2020,"The Heart of the Sea is a jeweled necklace. It is the color of the ocean. Most people would think it is precious but Rose, the main character, gets it as a gift and doesn't care about it. Rose's mother wants her to marry Caledon Hockley for the money. On the Titanic, Rose gets the Heart of the Sea as a gift from him.It is interesting that the two main characters in this movie are in opposite places in their lives. Rose feels trapped. Rose's family comes from money. She meets and falls in love with a boy named Jack. Jack is poor, gambles, and moves around a lot. Rose starts to change after spending time with Jack. He is like a role model.I would say age appropriateness for the movie is 9-10 and up. It has some sadness, a little bit of violence, and nudity. I rate it 8 out of 10 stars. I hope you enjoy the movie.",Titanic
2091,happ-4,Titanic,10,2 August 2006,"Titanic movie was directed by James Cameron is a true life story. I love this movie because of the tragic nature of the ship wreck which attracts some emotional feelings from the viewers. Titanic movie is personal and somehow pathetic in nature.Brock Lovett is a ruthless treasure hunter in search of a diamond neck less believed to have been submerged under the sea in a titanic liner titanic. He was rest assured when his crew retrieved a safe bearing a sketch of a beautiful woman wearing the diamond. The story became more inviting when an old lady by name Rose Dawson came forward to make claims of the drawing on watching it on a TV program. The historic event of the proof of ownership of the diamond by the lady in question may not be re-counted here However it is pertinent to note that Rose (the claimer) joined the Titanic at a young age Of seventeen when she was lured into a false marriage with a wealthy American by her mom, which almost landed her in a tragic end.",Titanic

2093,MusashiMan,"Two stories intertwined - one works, one doesn't.",6,26 August 2006,"Titanic seems like a split movie. On one hand, there is the implausible and badly scripted romance between the fictional characters, Jack and Rose. On the other hand, it is a spectacular re-telling of the story of the world's most famous shipwreck. Whether you like this movie or not depends on which half you focus on.The bad: The scripting is very bad. There are many, many lines which cause me to groan and wince. The dialogue comes off as stilted, and oftentimes an annoying stereotype of 1912 speech. The fictional characters are annoying and unlikeable. The whole film seems to have a left-wing anti-first-class bias where only the poor can actually feel love and the rich are simply snobs trying to one-up each other, never mind how many real first class couples had much deeper love for each other than Jack and Rose's fairytale relationship. There are some very disrespectful scenes in here that have little grounding in history. Officer Lightoller is portrayed as hysterical and unstable. Officer Murdoch is made to shoot two passengers before killing himself. The film's score is often repetitive and bombastic. The ""Heaven"" scene comes off as very contrived.The good: The movie is spectacular to see. Titanic buffs will love to see how good and accurate the large scale model of the ship looks. Thomas Andrews and Bruce Ismay are portrayed very well by Victor Garbor and Jonathan Hyde. The sinking scenes are quite accurate and show the violence of the event very well. One feels very sorry for the passengers because of the horrors that they suffered. The special effects look very good, even the CGI. The underwater photos of the wreck in the beginning are very beautiful and Cameron would go on to do some very important research with his submersibles after this film. In the end, this film generated a lot of interest in the story of the Titanic.Verdict: The Titanic itself is the real star of the film. Focus on that, and you should enjoy it.",Titanic
2094,lakeviewbaby09,Fact you Probably didn't know..,9,9 August 2006,"Titanic was a great movie. One of my favorites. But it's not 100% accurate, and I'm not talking about the goofs (mess ups). On the discovery channel there was a topic about the titanic. And People believe that the titanic sank because the iceberg hit the side of the ship. Now there is evidence that states the iceberg hit the side and the bottom. So therefore, however many hours they say it took the ship to sing is actually half of that. I'm not sure how many hours they had before the ship sank but for ExAmPLe if it was 3 they only had one in a half. So please comment on this I would love to hear what you have to say.

I think this movie has a great mix of such wonderful actors and a great director. Everything about this movie was wonderful. I have to say this will always be my favorite movie. And it was because of Kate Winslet that sparked my imagination and I've wanted to be an actress. So i owe her a great deal of thanks even though I have never met her, but would Love to meet her.

2101,gillaspie,Sink already!!,5,29 May 2001,"'Titanic' never deserved Best Picture, and certainly not in a year when 'As Good as it Gets' was in the running. (A movie which received a higher rating on this site by-the-way). I hope this means that people are realizing that selling lots and lots of tickets does not a great movie make. Especially when sales are heavily tipped by groups of 12 year old girls going to see Leonardo DiCraprio over and over. But, this is for whom the movies are filmed and the music is made. So I deal with it by writing reviews like this about movies I hate.The movie was just too damn long. About 3 hours too long. I thought boat would never start sinking, and then I thought it would never stop. The only part of the movie I really enjoyed was the scene with them dancing on the tables. If this movie was cut to 85 minutes it might have been tolerable, but as is I gave it a 5/10. (I only gave it that much because it was visually impressive).I don't think I would have been as hard on this film if I hadn't been subjected to night after night of hearing about it on the evening news. But, nothing changes the fact that the film is very cliché and a big waste of time!!!",Titanic
2102,itscalvinbowers-87021,Titanic,10,11 July 2020,"It makes me question the legitimacy of modern-day film criticism when I see films like this constantly getting thrown under the bus for a supposed ""lack of substance"". The discussion surrounding the medium as a whole has been spat on for years due to the ludicrous mentality that big budget blockbusters somehow have less validity than arthouse cinema or anything else outside of the usual wide release theater-fare. All genres deserve to stand shoulder to shoulder with one another, as they're all pieces of art and should be appreciated as such.James Cameron's 'Titanic' released in 1997 and became an instant classic, though a somewhat controversial one. It shattered every record imaginable and won countless awards for its bold style, immaculate set design, and groundbreaking everything. It was huge, and the film itself compliments that sentiment. The biggest boat in the world, the greatest love story ever told, and the most tragic disaster of the century. The sheer scale and spectacle of this film is incredible. It was massive, and even with an industry now focused on world ending events and apocalypses of all shapes and sizes, it still remains massive today.'Titanic' follows Rose, a seventeen-year-old aristocrat who, despite her luxurious life, is unsatisfied and longs for something more. She meets and subsequently falls in love with Jack, a poor artist who won his ticket in a game of poker. A very basic setup, right? One that we've all seen a thousand times before. The difference is, this is the one that everyone remembers. This is what separates this love story from other love stories: It's memorable. Clichés aren't bad, I honestly believe that they're essential to storytelling. It's what you do with them that matters. James Cameron takes a somewhat basic love story about two people from different worlds falling in love with each other despite their differences and puts it inside a disaster of monumental scale. We all know that the unsinkable ship will inevitably sink, but its everything before that - the characters - the buildup - the overconfidence that all the passengers and crew uphold - it plants the idea in your head that maybe, just maybe, it'll be different this time. The events that transpire before the sinking is what makes it all the more impactful. If it was just a random ship filled with people you don't care about, it wouldn't affect you. Instead, it's a real world tragedy with characters that you've spent hours watching grow and evolve.Themes of perseverance, freedom, and love are represented beautifully here. Images like the violinists trying to maintain a sense of duty and composure amidst the chaos will forever be ingrained in my head. My Heart Will Go On by Céline Dion is not only a beautiful piece of music, but it connects to what I think is, the central theme of the film. Remembrance. Push forward, but never forget. Rose promises Jack to survive and live her life, but she'll always remember her short, but magical time on the ship all those years ago.Despite the groundbreaking nature of 'Titanic', that's not what first comes to mind when talking about this film. It's the characters, the journey, and the story that's captured the hearts of many moviegoers and film fans alike. That's what was discussed when it released, that's what we discuss now, and that's what will be discussed for generations to follow.",Titanic

The build-up in this movie is matchless. The relationships formed are so powerful so that, at the very end, one is speechless and can't help but wonder what lovely adventures Jack and Rose were going to experience. Despite knowing the plot what with the ship sinking, Jack drowning etc., this movie is to me one of the most thrilling films of all time thanks to James Cameron and his detail-oriented brilliancy. DiCaprio and Winslet are exceptional in this movie and together, they form such a magical relationship that will make even the toughest of men believe in true love.",Titanic
2108,Vanessa_Kunkel,Ridiculous Dialogue,1,20 June 2001,"...ruined what could have been a very good film.  Every time we are drawn into the mood we are forced out with a ridiculous statement from one of the characters.  The best such example is when Jack and Rose are together reaching to hold on to the railing in what could have been a beautiful, symbolic moment, but no, Rose says ""this is where we first met"" in a cheesy little voice.  Moment gone - killed by stating the obvious.",Titanic

2110,cdth89413,Classic and Timeless,10,10 April 2012,"I just came back from watching it in IMAX 3D. The movie stands classic and timeless. If anything, with some revealing mistakes digitally modified (eg. The visible strings that pulled the cups off the fireplace where Mr. Andrews stood during the sinking; They re- colored the upper half of the funnel that fell upon those poor people; The metal reel that crinkled when it was hit by a man; The famous milky way shot where Rose was lying on the wooden plank) and the image enhanced, it looked better than ever and felt extremely intimate because of the ""subtle"" 3D conversion. The colors simply looked beautiful and bright and the change between blue and red intensified the drama and viewers' emotions very effectively. The ""I'm flying"" scene at the bow worked as if you were actually there, with seawater going by underneath your vision. The most wonderful thing was that as the movie went, the 3D effect gradually became ""invisible"" because all viewers got so deeply drawn into the film and they just got used to it. You will find yourself laughing at the ""cheesy"" jokes in the cheery and glamorous first half of the movie and quieting down and grieving for the tragic loss of so many lives as the ship sinks with the whole audience.It lived up to what they promised it to be. It is just such a wonderful thing that so many people are willing to go back to the cinemas and share the experience with all the other audiences there again and again, even just for the old time's sake. The watching of the movie itself is just so pleasant, emotional and nostalgic. It is definitely worth watching again on the big screen.",Titanic
2111,munifrafi,Titanic,9,17 September 2020,"I am incredible devotee of sentimental film and I'm enthused about the historical backdrop of the Titanic When I was a young person I originally observed the film ,the film delivered in 1997 yet I previously considered this to be a 14-year-old . I have been establishing for it and discovered it has been delivered in different nations. I actually this film when I was more youthful and realize that even this age would truly appreciate it. the story, the symbolism, the characters, the score and the sheer exhibition, all things considered, 'Titanic' was an occasion, not only a film. There was nothing similar to it previously, and there has been in no way like . Leonardo di Caprio and Kate Winslet, both moderately obscure entertainers at the hour of the film's unique delivery, sparkle as Jack and Rose, two youngsters from far edges of the social range who are united by destiny against the setting of perhaps the best misfortune. The primary hour acquaints us with the fundamental characters that we will go back in time with, and glancing through their eyes as they wonder over the wonders of life, and the progression of innovation. The remainder of the film is unadulterated energy, delight, sorrow, anticipation, and so on, and it has. Jack and Rose inevitably succumb to one another, and their affection is superb; at long last Cameron has gotten a genuine love relationship down on film. I continue watching this film at any rate 2 times each year. I know the content and each scene forwards and backwards. The Soundtrack is additionally incredible. It's a disgrace that the creation cut the last scene with 'David's Dialog In Prison'. Interestingly, this discourse is accessible in the Sound track The acting is great. The film was very elegantly composed and no cost was saved in resurrect Titanic. Everything looks as exquisite as it would have on the genuine Titanic.

Also, of course this film can't have an original plot or story - it was almost completely based on fact. (obviously Rose and Jack and that story were fictional, but many of the characters, time line, and details were fact, or presumed so after finding Titanic at the bottom of the ocean. It is impossible for a horrible film to make such an impact at the theaters. A movie like Da Vinci Code only made money because of the Media - but there was no such scandal with titanic.

And my favorite part is when jack went unscripted and said quote "" I'm the king of the world "" Best part of the movie that always makes me cry is when one of the musicians stayed behind to perform one last song and the rest of his group stayed with him and performed "" nearer my god to thee "" Then when he was finished he said quote "" gentleman it has been a privilege playing with you tonight "" Man that gets me every time idc how many times I see it idc who I'm around I will always cry at that part .",Titanic

Titanic is probably the only really romantic movie that I am willing to watch again and again, alone or with someone else. When they say that the Titanic kiss was the most famous, they weren't kidding. Man I'd LOVE to have someone kiss ME like that on the bow of a famous ship the day the ship was supposed to sink.

Zane acted his role with devastating and masterly demeanour, Kate portrayed her role of the unwilling bride impeccably. Celine Dion's ' My heart will go on' just adds defiant hope in the face of enormous tragedy.

This movie use many technique to help this movie complete with a prop like some part of ships and CG like ocean and iceberg but the thing that's make this movie popular and we can't disagree that is soundtrack ""My heart will go on""
-The character: For Jack Dawson starring by Leonardo DiCaprio and Rose DeWitt Bukater starring by Kate Winslet acting beautiful performance, where both actors were wonderfully suited to their role. It's like Leo and Kate become the Iconic of this movie of all time.

2139,tbgroucho,Simply Boring,1,24 March 2002,"The simple fact is that the lead characters are badly-written cliches serving a formulaic story.  The rich/poor conflict is overdone, and not believable (and the suffering of those below versus the comfort of those above amid the chaos of the sinking ship an exaggeration of history at best). Virtually every line spoken by the lead actors is wooden, false, unbelievable; it is hard to judge the acting when the actors -- who have shown considerable talent elsewhere -- are given such awful things to say>  I do think Zane looks particularly bad here, but I'd give everyone a benefit-of-doubt due to the script.  The frame story is of course ridiculous, but we could say the same thing about _Citizen Kane_; the difference is that the latter film is beautifully photographed, superbly acted,impressively composed, brilliantly edited, sophisiticated in its use of sound, and extremely well-written.  _Titanic_ is most interesting when it shows us historical figures:  Kathy Bates' Molly Brown is impressive (though her intervention in the love story is utter nonsense, and again because it is made up and badly so).  The engineer whose awareness of the fact that there are not enough boats to save everyone is also interesting.  The story of the band playing on, whatever they may have actually played (there is some debate), was handled in a fairly moving way.  There is a lovely shot of an elderly couple resting in each other's arms, awaiting the end; this too echoes at least one such wealthy couple who chose to die together rather than be separated amid the ""women and children first"" calls.  The ship's demise looks impressive, and of course is welcome, given the excessive length of the film.  But overall the film sinks in one-dimensional characters spewing out one-dimensional lines(to even characterize some of them as one-dimensional is charitable)over one-dimensional music.  The _Terminator_ films and _Aliens_ are more believable and show more depth (though if we'd listened carefully to Hamiliton's lines in the second T film, we might have foreseen _Titanic_'s aesthetic failure).",Titanic

Jack Dawson ( DiCaprio) is a poor artist who won his ticket on Titanic by a lucky poker hand who saves Rose from killing herself. The next day he is invited to dinner in first class as a ""reward"" for saving her. Rose's mother who is a very selfish person who only cares for money takes an instant dislike toward him because he is in Steerage. Cal (Zane) is also a very selfish person who is Rose's fiancé.After their dinner Jack invites Kate to come to Steerage and have a fun time. Cal's butler or whatever he was sees Rose in Steerage and tells Cal. Cal is angry and later on he gives Rose a rare blue diamond as a token of love. rose is forbidden to see Jack again but she disobeys Cal. On that same day jack sketches Rose nude with the necklace and then one thing leads to another. Rose and Jack make love. Then Cal see's Rose's drawing in the safe where rose put it along with the diamond. Then he gets an idea he'll frame Jack for stealing the diamond. He sends his butler to skillfully put it in Jack's pocket and then Jack is placed as a prisoner. Rose frantically sets out to look for him and while this is going on the ship is sinking and everybody is evacuating. She finds Jack and they escape to the top of the ship. Since only women and children were going first on boats Rose gets on forcefully by Cal's and her mother's wish. Then suddenly goes up and to Jack she leaves the boat without the people because she only wants to stay with Jack. When the Ship sinks Rose and Jack dive to the bottom there they stay until Jack dies. Then Rose blows a whistle and a rescue comes. And saves her and not JACk. So that was basically it.

The only redeeming value comes from the actual sinking of the Titanic, which unfortunately doesn't happen in the first ten minutes. We do get to watch a pathetic love story between Jack & Rose. Actually more like a molestation by Rose since Jack appears to be approximately twelve years old. Very creepy. Oh yeah, horribly casted! I forgot. I can't believe I let my wife talk me into seeing this one when it came out. Let this be a lesson to you all. Cameron is definitely a second rate director and a questionable human being to boot.(Just ask Linda Hamilton) To sum it up, run far and fast from this film. It will only disappoint you.

2143,johnbroadwell,Titanic Letdown.,1,23 May 2021,"If I had to sum up this movie in one word, it would be overrated. Why people think this is a classic is beyond me. The film retels the disaster of the Titanic, in which a massive cruise ship crashed into an iceberg and sank, killing 1500 people. For the film, the characters of Jack and Rose take center stage. I must say, both actors did an amazing job at replicating two pieces of cardboard with tape-recorders stuck to them. The dialogue is flat and boring. All of the shots almost never show anything of interest. This is a huge disappointment, especially since it came from James Cameron, who has directed so many hits like Avatar, Terminator, Point Break, and Aliens. In terms of creative elements, there are none. The most exciting part of the film was when the ship crashed and started to capsize. For me, this is because I thought that the main characters would die, and I wouldn't have to see them anymore. But alas, this movie can't even give me that satisfaction. The film Titanic is as much of a shipwreck as the boat was. Unwatchable. Unbearable. The only thing that brings me any happiness from this movie is the fact that after this, Leonardo DiCaprio was still able to find work. I am amazed that his career did not go down with the ship after this performance in this movie. In Summary, if you are bored and want to watch a movie about a boat, watch Under Siege. I'm serious. I would rather watch a Steven Segal movie than subject myself to this again.",Titanic

Oddly enough, I know people who have not watched this movie. Although the film is based on real events, the film itself has already become a legend.9 only because she could have moved))",Titanic
2148,geyer1732,One seriously hot scene worth re-watching,9,10 December 2006,The love scene in the auto in the cargo hold is absolutely innocuous but man is it hot. I rate it as up there with Superman flying Lois lane. Nothing dirty just quite erotic. The facts of the movie were excellent for the time but as research progresses it becomes more and more likely the dramatic stern rise before final sinking did not actually take place. Too bad as that was excellent drama and probably why that version of the sinking was chosen. Victor Newman/Hans/Eric Braeden/rat patrol German Officer deserved more screen time. Why waste/edit a big name nearly out of the picture. To all those that slam the picture-Get a Life-it is good drama and the effects are enough to keep anyones attention. Jacks death scene is probably one of the best ever filmed.,Titanic
2149,maty0307,A Fantastic Movie Experience,10,12 December 2006,"Titanic is the most amazing movie I have ever seen. Yes, it's my favorite movie. Why, you may ask? Titanic has something for everyone: romance, action, drama, and even a little bit of comedy. Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio are expertly cast as two lovers who meet on the doomed ship, the Titanic. Heartbreakingly beautiful, this movie will touch your life. I remember the first time I saw Titanic. The only thing I could think of was, ""Wow. How can they ever make a better movie?"" I recommend this movie to everyone, because there is no possible way you can not find something you can love in what is one of the best movies of all time...Titanic.",Titanic

2151,Coolbeanz101,Wow,10,16 December 2006,"Although Im a girl, I did not watch this film to see Leonardo Dicaprio, It was actually because of watching th film for the first time that I fell in love with him.The acting and effects are amazing with a gripping storyline to go with them. This has definitely got to be my all time favourite but I don't want to start an argument with anyone who thinks it was crap. I personally loved it and If you haven't seen it yet, you definitely should. You may not enjoy it, in which case you would have just wasted three hours of your life but if you do enjoy it...thats three hours definitely worth wasting on the film again. Warning...it may cause tears!",Titanic

However This movie is very long and not all peoples have time to watch 3 hours for a movie it's just too long.

2154,apgreinetz,to lovers on the unsinkable ship,10,3 October 2008,"amazing This is the best movie i've EVER seen. what this film is about is Jack (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) how wins tickets in a card game and then meets a girl on the ship, named Rose (played by Kate Winslet) who tries to jump of the end of the ship. She is saved by Jack and they fall in love, but rose is going to be wed. This film is good because it runs with a nice flow and exiting. Some of the best parts are when you see the water bursting throw the walls. Now if you don't like sad films DON'T WATCH THIS FILM it is sad. Some of the saddest parts are when you see every body floating in the water, and when you see the woman not wanting to go in the lifeboat without their husbands. And if you don't like romance movies don't watch this, but if you do then watch it. Now for my finale rating 10/10, but thats not all I think that this film should be listed on the IMDb top 250 but it is not anyway i hope that you like this film. But you may not",Titanic

Every time you watch it, you are emotionally just as involved as you were the very first time!! You can't stop crying your heart out. And the biggest question of the century- WHY DIDN'T KATE GIVE SOME SPACE TO JACK ON THAT PLANK!!!! We all know, it was ENOUGH for the two.From story, to direction, to performances and the overall emotional drama, EVERYTHING was TOP NOTCH!! Kate Winslet and Leonardo Dicaprio are great actors but their performances in TITANIC shall always be my personal favorite. This timeless classic can be watched over and over again with the same interest in the movie as the very first time you watched it. The sinking of that magnificent ship has always triggered audiences and it shall never go old. A perfect masterpiece! 10/10 for the movie.",Titanic

2160,eugeniacharleane,The Best Romance Ever,10,24 August 2021,"I am not a person who likes to watch drama or romance movies because for me it is a boring film genre. The first time I got to know this movie was from my dad and he said that a lot of people were very interested in this movie. I was too curious at that time and coincidentally Titanic is on Netflix, then i watched it and it was the first time i liked romance movies. Jack and Rose's love experience is very moving and has a deep meaning. This film contains sadness because every actors and actress play their role so well that the audiences can feel the same way. Although the duration of this film is quite long but there is not one scene that I missed to watch it. My favorite scene is in the middle of the film, when Jack and Rose are at the end of the cruise ship and they are looking at the beautiful sunset. I highly recommend this film, especially for those of you who like to watch romance films. Trust me, your time will not be wasted!",Titanic
2161,horsecrazyequestrian,It never gets old...,10,31 December 2006,"This is my favorite movie ever. I have been watching it since 1998 and it has never gotten old. I loved how the plot of the movie blended so well with the actual events, and the attention to detail was out of this world. The accuracy with the ship's details such as the opulence of the interior First Class areas, the riveting detail on the ship's exterior, the wardrobes of the actors and actresses, it all seemed so real, like time went back to 1912 and stood still, like it was all back again. And the love story between Jack and Rose, oh it was so nice. I love how they had an older Rose telling the story, and when it switched from her now to how she was then. It was awesome! One of my favorite scenes though, is definitely the ""King of the World"" scene because I think that James Cameron really captured the feeling of the time of the Titanic's. She was the largest ship afloat, the finest afloat, and it was during a time when people thought they had nowhere to go but up. Things were changing and getting better all the time with new technologies, and the Titanic was like an icon for that. So the King of the World part is just awesome. Imagine a Third Class passenger winning a ticket like that. You could only imagine that they'd had to have felt that way. And then when the camera comes back and you see the Titanic, proud on the waves in all her glory, it's truly awesome. And then when they zoom in on Captain Smith, beaming proudly, what an awesome way to portray him. You have to wonder if he really felt that way then. How proud he must've felt. The only thing that I didn't like about it was how they portrayed First Officer Murdoch. There were some witnesses who said they heard shots or saw shots being fired, reports of an officer shooting himself that night, but it was never proved. And given the real Officer Murdoch's character, I don't think he did anything like that. Nor do I think any of the officers shot themselves or someone else. They made him out to be a villain that I don't believe he was. Other than the fact that I thought Rose said ""Jack"" one too many times, the movie was near perfect. Totally awesome. This was just an unforgettable movie. The best ever. There will be no more like it. It's truly one of a kind, that cannot be beaten. I hope it forever stays above all the ranks!",Titanic
2162,total-gaming-freak,"Potentially a good movie, but poor writing Left it sunk.",3,24 January 2007,"A decent enough movie with near unlimited potential, unfortunately marred by a ending that nearly had me LAUGHING it was so bad. Leonardo de'caprio may have been a relatively good catch, but at some points, repeating the same line over and over and over and over and OVER again just got old. the soundtrack is one of the best parts though, some (now) Extremely recognizable music spawned from that movie. with slightly better acting and a DECENT writer, it may have fared better with me, but it ended up being the butt of my joke. if they make a remake in ten years or so, I can only hope that It doesn't end up being as bad as this movie was.a 3/5 for originality a 1/5 for writing, script and ending a 2/5 for SGI a total of 1/5 (3/10)Better luck next time.",Titanic

My mom soon got me the movie and I finally got it. The movie is so powerful and it makes me cry every time i watch it. It is my all time favorite movie. The storyline is wonderful and I love the relationship between Rose and Jack. So innocent but so restricted at the same time. 2 thumbs up to James Cameron who made the effects so wonderful that i feel like Im in the water with all of the dying people.

The movie was great and but I do not think I can watch it again without crying since it was a very touching cry. It can melt the hearts of even the cruelest people in the world. My favorite part of the movie was when Rose was standing outside of the ship with her hands spread out and Jack was right behind her. I also liked the part when Jack was tied to the pole at the bottom of the ship and Rose came to save Jack. The part that I did not like was about the class being spread out. For example, the rich people were considered the important the poor or middle class people. I recommend everyone to see this movie and guarantee that no one will be disappointed about the movie being boring or worthless.",Titanic

The visual effects are astonishing (for 1997) , the acting is amazing, James Cameron's directing was awesome, and the music. OH THE MUSIC! No song as ever shivered my bones like ""Unwilling To Stay Unwilling To Leave"" or ""Rose"". These songs forever left their mark in my heart.

Leonardo DiCaprio is fantastic and totally believable, and some of the dialogue between Rose and Jack (particularly where they first meet) is hilarious, but so natural. Cal is deliciously evil, and the references to 'somebody Picasso' and Freud made me laugh. The one thing I disliked about it was the ending, where Rose and Jack are reunited. It would have been so much more powerful if it had been the same scene, but in an empty room ; the clapping of the rest of the cast doesn't seem to fit. Apart from that, this is an amazing film, beautifully filmed, and much as I dislike Celine Dion, the music is powerfully emotive.",Titanic

I would like it if they made a sequel of the movie or make another one in the year 2008 or 2012. So it will be exactly 100yrs. since titanic sank. i would really like it if they used more exact details or try to find all the information and go from that.

Why? Because the screen playwright and director understood that true human glory is not about special effects, but characterisation.I can't begin to recount the superficiality and shallowness of this dreadful film - where there's absolutely no foundation for genuine affection, much less enduring love. And, worst of all, with his very inapt hands, James Cameron attempted to repeat the cliche of rich girl meets poor boy, which bears no significance whatsoever to the plot(if it can be called one), in which everybody was subject to a violent death, nobleman or peasant.The art of tragedy is a tricky one, but there is one simple rule - make your characters genuine, realistic, and most of all believable, so that the audience will feel what they feel, breathe what they breathe and, in the end, partake in the experience.",Titanic

2174,ChanManPok,A great film which worth 11 Oscars,10,10 March 2007,"Titanic is one of the greatest motion picture about love that I've seen through these years. It gives the audience about a imaginary romance which won't be happened in the real world, the love of a rich and a poor, through life and death. I believe this is the main reason for people to watch it.The reason that I give Titanic for 10 stars is because every part of this movie is excellent. It don't rely much on props but attractive, striking scenes. For my favorite scene of it is, of course, when Titanic crashed on the iceberg and passengers started to try to escape from Titanic. It is my most memorable moment. I even can't get my eyes out of the screen.I watched Titanic for 3 or 4 times in about 3 years.

I don't care what others say, I say all the acting was perfect and the movie is the greatest I think I have ever seen. I hate Celene Dion but her song in this movie was a perfect match and a masterpiece! When this movie comes on TV like it did tonight, even though I have the DVD I still watch it live on TV. It's one of those movies that, if you see it on, you gotta watch it again. I used to be in the Navy and believe me, they are right about the water when it's that cold and what it does to your body. It's a sad horrific way to die. I feel for those people on the ship and wish it never happened. Human tragedy is an awful thing and Cameron does a perfect job of bringing that home to all of us.

I am obsessed!!!!!!! Well any way I really like this movie. I like how everything is so real. I find it amazing that they filmed this movie in a large pool and that some of the life boats and props were made by the manufactures that made the real ones for the actual Titanic. If you haven't seen this movie then you definitely should especially if you like Leo like i do. This movie won 11 Oscars! Movie Summary- This is a fantastic movie about two lovers on the unsinkable ship the S.S. Titanic. Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater are the main characters. Jack is a poor third class passenger and Rose is a rich first class passenger. Rose is engaged to a mean rich man named Cal. Rose and Jack meet and fall in love in less than a day. They spend time together and fall more in love. Rose tries to break away from this intense feeling but cannot because her feelings for Jack are too strong. Everything is going almost perfect until the ship begins to sink. The two lovers have an amazing and suspenseful adventure but to find out the end of this amazing tale watch Titanic!

2179,nels1354,Three hours of torment,1,16 April 2007,"Hands down one of the worst movies ever made, just a shame that the French can't take credit for this one. Paper thin plots, characterizations, and with an excessive running time that makes you wish only that the iceberg had been bigger. The acting is awful and completely under uses the talents of both DiCaprio and Winslett. DiCaprio is capable of acting, look at ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"", and Winslett has had some charing roles as well, but neither of them can give much in this straight jacket of a script. Directing a large boat into a chunk of floating ice is hardly a talent worth accolades, Cameron has done better. Once upon a time, he made movies that were marginally imaginative, Titanic certainly puts an end to that. It's a pity because you've already probably seen and suffered through this one, but if not, skip it. Chasey Lane can give more feeling and ""Night of the Living Dead"" more story.",Titanic
2180,yeshuamyking77,Just saw this again on TV recently,10,6 August 2008,"An absolutely terrific film. I saw it when it first came out in the theater and loved it. Breathtaking, romantic, epic and terribly sad.My only gripe with the film is the ending. Granted, I understand it makes more dramatic sense for Jack to die, but the reason he dies is so stupid. He tries to get on the door with Rose and it starts to sink. So, he gallantly allows her to stay on the door while he freezes to death in the Atlantic.Um ... could you try balancing on either end? Here Rose, you sit on this end, and I'll sit on the other. Let's just try it. Maybe it won't work, but it's better than prying my dead, frozen hands off the door at the end of the film. Or hey, maybe I'll swim around for a few minutes and see if I can find another piece of debris to float on. It's just dumb that neither of these options occur to them.Again, I get the reasons why, for the story's sake, Jack must die. It just doesn't make any sense outside the dramatic impetus.Otherwise, terrific film. I could see it again and again without getting tired of it.",Titanic
2181,lilcutie9124,Poem,10,19 May 2007,"Upon pure ocean waters, a ship of dreams set sail, Unsinkable the titanic soared gently across the sea, Unknown to all surroundings, this pearl ship was frail, A glistening beauty underneath heavens lusting sky, While straying gently into the darkened night of destruction.Elaborate stars shined romantically over the vessel, As night was brought upon, and destiny awaited, Heavens gates slowly opened up, as god stated, ""Follow the golden stairway"", and silently he waited While heavens angels where brought to him above.Hitting a deathly iceberg titanic slowly began to sink, Leaving many souls trapped upon the beautiful ship, As silently with no one around this boat went down, And with an oceans wave, gods angels began to drown, As they gave there hearts to the weeping ocean.The lost souls of titanic now travel upon the ship, Still seeking misery for the death of there hearts, Floating within the waters accepting there fate, While many still live on with there soul mate As they dance as souls across the ballroom floor.",Titanic

The special effects are amazing. Even after so long ago it's still right up their with the rest. James Cameron has made great movies (aliens, the terminator/2, the abyss) and this is one of his best.All the actors do a good job. The leading characters a people you want to fallow and you want them to make it. It's funny to see that the movie only gets a 7.2 while it made over 1.8 billion and it won 11 Oscars.

Leonardo DiCaprio, too, did a great job, and the special effects seem pretty good for 1997.I can't, however, really seem to understand how people can hate this movie. It's Titanic... people hate the Titanic because it sank, failed, when it was supposedly ""unsinkable""... get your facts straight, NONE of the builders at Harland and Wolff, White Star Line, ANYBODY, called it unsinkable. ""Practically Unsinkable"", YES, plain ""unsinkable"", no, and it ""was the name unsinkable that caught people's imaginations"".It's just so horrible to hear that people watch it (and sometimes like it), but don't want to admit it.

First off, let me say, I am a big fan of James Cameron's movies, so I was incredibly dissapointed by this movie.  This movie looks like it was made for the lifetime network. The special effects were wonderful........that is the only nice thing I can say about it.  It has a BAD!!! made for tv plot that is so thin Collista Flockhart would be jealous.  The love story was completely unbelievable, and DiCaprio besides giving a horrible performance was just plain annoying. The fact that it is the biggest grossing movie in history is a very telling commentary on our society and just plain sad. How did this movie win any oscars let alone one for EDITING!!!  I don't think anyone edited this POS(piece of s--t) at all. This movie took longer to watch than the ship did to sink,  that is not a lie.  Jim Cameron owes me 3 hours of my life back       !!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!SPOILER ALERT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Now to the ending. I rather enjoyed watching Leo freeze to death....to me it was the high point in the film, although I had to wait 3 BLEEPING hours to get to it.

2185,cool_alice_17,A true masterpiece,10,14 June 2007,"James Cameron (the writer and director) is truly a ledgend in himself. The Titanic is a breathtaking movie which covers just about every aspect of what a film should have in it. The Titanic is immensely sad and will tug at the heart of even the most stone hearted of people. And what makes the movie just so much more tragic is the fact it's a true story based of course on the 1912 voyage of the Titanic ship; which tragically sunk taking more than 1500 passengers down with it! The 194 minute movie captures your eye, heart and imagination in so many ways. A three hour movie probably has put of a lot of people but honestly you do not feel that in this movie it's a perfect length. James Camerons' choice of actors/actresses is amazing. The gorgeous fresh faced, Leonardo Di Caprio shines brighter than the sun in his role. As does Kate Winslet who plays the posh upper class Rose perfectly.The only flaw I could attempt to pick out of the Titanic is the effects of the ship sinking in its last moments; they could have probably been better; but for a 1997 movie I don't think we can complain.The Titanic has won an incredible 11 Oscars, 76 other awards and has had 48 nominations! And that just proves the movie truly is a masterpiece which will never be replaced.I can guarantee you really have not lived until you see James Camerons Titanic!",Titanic
2186,maazahmedsiddiqui-2,A Movie To Remember,10,24 October 2007,"Titanic was a movie that cannot be forgotten for ages. Titanic is the best movie I have ever seen. Titanic was perfect! It had everything. Drama, love, humor, adventure, action. You cant say what really happened on THE REAL TITANIC because you were not on it yourself. James Cameron (cool director) just a gave us an idea of how it must have felt to be on the real ship. He did a great job in using a love story to make people understand the tragedy of the real Titanic. JAMES CAMERON did a great job in showing us what it must have been to be in a sinking Titanic. I really loved it and I REALLY, REALLY recommend this movie to all of you!!!",Titanic
2187,e_baker_90,Down Right AMAZING,10,2 July 2007,"TITANIC is a dizzying compilation of a tragic event in our history and a phenomenal riveting love story. Titanic grabs you the moment it starts and ""never lets go"" even after the movie is finished, and the actors/actresses performances in this movie are as amazing as the special effects are brilliant. Even at the end in the grand staircase where you see everyones that was on Titanic, you see their whole story play out in your mind as if they were the real people and as if you were on the Titanic in 1912 and knew everyones story. All of this along with the spectacular soundtrack composed by James Horner will leave you absolutely speechless and awe inspired. This is definitely is one of the best movies of its kind EVER! Even 10 years after its creation it never ceases to amaze, thrill, and touch. Phenomenal, riveting, amazing, brilliant, spectacular, and a perfect TEN!",Titanic

2191,michaud34,More than just a love story and story of the Titanic,10,25 March 2006,"This version of the Titanic is a well done movie that blends a love story and an accurate account of the voyage and sinking of the great ship together. Mr. Cameron took painstaking efforts to present the Titanic as she actually looked and sank (using one of the popular theories as to how she sank).But what impressed me most is the statement made through this movie regarding the rich and poor/lower class people. The point is well expressed how each class felt about the other. The differences are seen from the boarding of the Titanic all the way to the rescue at sea. 1rst class embarked directly while 3rd class required an examination (for lice and whatnot)before embarkation. Third class was kept below decks until first and second class were loaded onto lifeboats during Titanic's sinking. On the Carpthia, third class was kept on an open deck. In reality, one child was lost from 1rst and 2nd class while 52 out of 109 children were lost in 3rd class (taken from ""Titanic"" by Thomas E. Bonsall, published by Gallery Books, 1987).I would highly recommend , if interested, to purchase the DVD and view the deleted scenes and alternative ending. It will help tie things together and even mentions the Californian (along with their wireless operator). The Califronian was a vessel that if its Captain took the rockets Titanic fired seriously, could have saved all aboard as she was only about ten miles from Titanic. One deleted scene also shows the heartbreaking end for three third class passengers alluding to the last statement in the above paragraph.Lastly, a good movie has: good acting, good writing, a good film crew, and good music. The music blends well with the love story, the action, and the ship itself.",Titanic
2192,catalan5615,The Titanic,9,5 November 2007,"The Titanic is one of my favorite movies because it was based on a true story. This movie has a lot of drama, action, and suspense. I like the setting of this movie because it takes place in the early 1900's and the replica of the ship is very semilar to the one that really sank in the Atlantic ocean. This is a very sad movie, and it also breaks your heart how all those people die trying to save their lives. Jack and Rose are the main character; they fall in love when they meet in the ship and they go through a lot of problems to stay together, but at the end it is very sad to see him die and not be able to be with his loved one. My vote for this movie is a 9 because it is a very good movie. I believe that the producers and directors did a very excellent job with this movie.",Titanic
2193,AbortedFetus,Leonardo DiCaprio is not a bad actor...,2,5 January 2003,"...However apparently fans of this film are quick to think people dislike it because of him. Not true. This movie could suck the ship itself through a coffee stirrer it's so horrible. I love most of James Cameron's work, but honestly after I saw this I lost faith. How do you go from Terminator, Aliens, T2, Strange Days etc. to this!?! How!?Anyway back to the DiCaprio thing, you people who bash this movie simply because you hate him need to see What's Eating Gilbert Grape or The Basketball Diaries or something, he in fact CAN act. You people who think everyone hates this movie because of their jealousy or whatever towards Leo, can it, I know I'm not the only one who thinks he's a decent actor yet also thought Titanic was a stinker.The problem lies within Cameron's script, the dialogue sounded like he was still writing for Arnold's T-800. Not a problem if the characters happened to be cyborgs, but unless I'm mistaken they were actually supposed to be real people.I give it 3/10, it would've been a 2 but I got a chuckle when the guy fell and smacked into the propeller.",Titanic
2194,Jordan101189,Awesome!,10,23 November 2007,"'Titanic' is a movie which I first saw when i was about 9 years old. I was totally blown away by this astounding epic! The movie starts in the present day, with a treasure hunter named Brock Lovett (Bill Paxton), whom is searching for a priceless diamond artifact aboard the wreck of the Titanic. Failing to find it, he is contacted by a 100 year old woman named Rose Calvert (Best Supporting Actress-Nominee Gloria Stuart), who claims to be the woman sketched in a book that Lovett found aboard the Titanic. Rose makes her way out to the salvage ship, and proceeds to tell Lovett and his crew her story of when she sailed on the supposedly 'Unsinkable' ship. The movie then jumps back to April 10th 1912, in Southampton where the Titanic is ready to set sail on its maiden voyage to New York. The younger Rose, named, at the time, Rose Dewitt Bukater (Best Actress-Nominee Kate Winslet), is travelling with her domineering mother and her tycoon fiancé Caledon Hockley, whom Rose's mother is determined to see her marry, for his extreme wealth. Rose doesn't love cal, and she attempts to commit suicide by throwing herself off the back of the ship. However she is rescued by steerage passenger Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). They quickly fall in love and soon she decides she'd rather be with Jack than Cal. However, their love is to be short-lived. At 1hr 36 minutes into the film, it reaches a pivotal moment, when the ship strikes an iceberg in the freezing cold Atlantic ocean. From this point onwards, the ship moves from the love story, into a dramatic, thrilling race for survival! The visual effects of the ship sinking are spectacular! Although most of the shots are of the real life-size set built for the film. The scene where the ship breaks in two, is one of my favourite scenes, as the effects are brilliant! The film was directed by one of my favourite Hollywood directors, James Cameron, creator and Director of 'The Terminator'(1984) and its hugely successful sequel 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'(1991). His direction on this film is sheer brilliance. He delivers a brilliant insight into how upper class lived in the early 1900s, and he shatters it all with brilliant heart-pounding suspense and drama!The film was hugely successful, winning a staggering eleven Oscars, making it only the second film in history to do so, after Ben Hur (1959) James Cameron won the well deserved 'Best Director' Oscar and the most prestigious 'Best Picture' Oscar. The film also won Best Costume Design, Cinematography, Editing, Art Direction, Sound, Sound Effects, Sound Effects Editing and Visual Effects. To date, almost a decade on, 'Titanic' still stands as the highest grossing film of all time, with just over $1 Billion.I would definitely recommend this film, especially now as it will soon be celebrating its 10th anniversary. It is a lengthy film, running at exactly 3 hours. However, it is well worth it! A fantastic Epic Film!!A well deserved 10/10.",Titanic
2195,Phantomphan111,My heart will go on.......,10,15 November 2007,"This movie is definitely one of my all time favorites, i saw it in the theater when i was young and didn't really appreciate it then, I do now! Its simply stunning, some of the best costumes, sets and special effects i have ever seen, especially the final horrific demise of the luxury liner.From the moment the passengers board the ship, to the first moment when Jack and Rose meet as he tries to keep her from committing suicide, I am entranced. Its stupid, but every time i pray the ship dosen't sink. From then on it's very emotional and I cry every time Jack dies, and of course the unforgettable moment when Rose returns ""the heart of the ocean"" to the sea.Spectacular, i highly recommend it.",Titanic

The film surely stand the test of time, and is proved that even 11 years after it release it still has the ability to astonish each viewer that has the privilege to watch it. It has the capability to stir every emotion inside. It contains all of the elements that make a beautiful movie. Its created with its amazing cast and superb acting.Its also a showcase for Winslet and DiCaprio, two actors who have much become the greatest actors of our generation, and James Cameron's incredible and stunning directorial abilities.What few flaws it has are nearly unnoticeable in this film that is beyond beautiful.

2199,eimear114,Not supposed to be accurate,9,7 January 2008,"Don't get me wrong, I love the titanic but the historical inaccuracies really annoy me. like the fact that when the ship went under you could see the word Liverpool written on it but it merely sailed from Liverpool, it was created and built in Belfast. also for a ship created in northern Ireland there was English, Scottish, Irish and even welsh accents in it but not one northern Ireland accent which is strongly different from the rest, which fails to show the true origins of the film and i have to say i feel cheated!! (i am from NI) that being said i don't think that Cameron's aim was to show the history but to in fact show the emotion of the event which he does very successfully. definitely worth the tears i shed every time i watch it!!",Titanic
2200,anthony931206,My Heart Will Go On?,1,24 January 2008,"Titanic is absolutely not a worth-watching movie. In the film, Rose, Caledon and Rose's mother went on board a so-called unsinkable ship called Titanic. Accidentally, Jack Dawson and his friend won two tickets of Titanic in a poker game. Rose and Jack loves each other at one sight. However, after an accident, Jack died, leaving Rose alone.In this expensive film, the only wonderful thing is the sound effect. That is quite exciting or breathtaking when ship is going to sink. The sound can successfully build the suitable atmosphere.However, there are quite a lot of unfavorable things that make this movie into a crap. Firstly, the time needed to watch this film is three hours which is a long time. Most of the time are talking about two teenagers dating. That's boring watching this. The only worth-watching part is the sinking part. Therefore, this is absolutely a waste of time and we can do a lot more meaningful things. Secondly, some parts in the film are not sensible. For example, when the ship is sinking, there is a band playing music. Are they celebrating the sink of the ship which symbolizes the end of the movie? Also, Caledon Hockley is a nice man before boarding the ship. However, when he saw Rose and Jack kissing, he immediately became an evil. That's impossible. Lastly, the story is quite strange. This story is going to tell us that love is everlasting which can be realized from the song called ""My Heart Will Go On"". However, Caledon in the movie loves Rose very much and died for it. In contrast, Jack, a suddenly appear person, becomes a hero.In conclusion, I think that the film is dreadful in many ways including the arrangement of the story line, the length and the meaning. If you think that you have nothing else meaningful to do, I recommend you to sleep instead of wasting time and money on watching this meaningless movie.",Titanic

Its plot is un-original (boy meets girl, falls in love, than heartbreak), its script is un-original and its acting is mediocre. The only reason its #1 in money is: The titanics fame, and teeny bopper girls that watch it over 30 times in the theatre during its release.

2205,misterturtle,highly overrated,1,21 September 2002,"I, like many people, saw this film in the theatre when it first came out in '97. It was a below average film at best, defiantly not the ""masterpiece"" that all these ""Titanic"" fanboys like to make it out as. First off, DiCaprio is a terrible actor no matter which way you look at it. People just like him because of his looks. His acting ""skills"" essentially consist of saying a lot of cheesy lines and trying to act sexy. Second, the film itself had a rather boring and simple plot: girl falls in love with guy, ship they're on sinks, lots of crappy love scenes thereafter. Anyone with an IQ above 50 will realize this isn't ingenious in any way whatsoever. Nor is it original. Plus the director felt the need to drag it out for 3+ hours. I could compress it into a 1 hour block without losing any of the plot. In conclusion, ""Titanic"" is the most overrated movie to date. Why it got so much attention and money is beyond me.",Titanic

2207,mike_MJ,barely hanging onto life,6,6 May 2008,"James Cameron, as is well known, stood firm not long after he finished work on this, his most audacious and confrontational film, yet even the most casual viewing of Titanic begs the question - had he not been lauded, would he have kept it real anyway? Every sequence, every shot and practically every moment of this film is so burdened with despair, barely concealed rage and a towering disgust with the human race, one gets the impression that Cameron was barely hanging onto life - and any attendant shreds of hope - by his fingernails. Although ostensibly an adaptation of one of Roger Hargreave’s most depraved works channeled through the horrifying excesses of the Oxford/Cambridge boat race with the Fascist ruling classes as its (authentically vile) villains, Titanic also contains a lot of contemporary criticism - Cameron hated the modern world, and explained the stomach-churning sink-age-isms as a none-too-subtle attack on the encroaching global domination of the fast food chains. (The scenes of sexual excess can similarly be read as a despairing attack on the permissive society - those who come to Titanic expecting titillation or B-movie sleaze will be sorely disappointed.) Beyond the nihilistic content, which has been well documented elsewhere, the film has an overall mood that seems to have been engineered to make the viewer thoroughly depressed. Shot on washed-out, faded film stock using primarily static cameras, long shots, choppy editing and very few cutaways, Titanic has a visual style reminiscent of cinema-verite documentary. Add to this the unnerving use of big band music, piano dirges and the (intentionally?) scrappy post-dubbed dialogue, and the distancing effect on the viewer is complete. Titanic comes across as one long primal scream of rage, designed to shake the viewer out of his complacency, and in this respect, the film succeeds unequivocally. Whether or not you would care to watch this more than once, or indeed for 'entertainment', is another matter, but Titanic is an important film that demands a careful viewing ONLY by those prepared for it.",Titanic
2208,Tricky74,"Drawnout, though not a complete disaster",7,7 March 2009,"I've now seen this film several times, and it does get better. I promise! The first time, I must confess, I found it laughable! The problem was that, at times, it appears to present itself as a documentary-which it is not! It is an epic love story which happens to be set upon the Titanic, that is all-and there is nothing wrong with that. There are some good performances and room in the story for some engaging character development. There are also great special effects and plenty of action scenes, to keep your pulse up. So, in summary-if it's historical accuracy you seek then rent a documentary, if you want an absorbing (if rather drawn out) love story you could do worse.",Titanic
2209,eriko-happy-oxp2,Titanic,10,22 June 2008,"""Titanic"" is my favorite movie!! This movie is very long, but I have never felt that it's boring. I knew the real love by this movie, Jack DawsonRose and Dewitt Bukater were really really devoted to each other. I thought it's great love. And I also like two main actors the music of this movie. Their play is so natural but we can feel their strong passion. Leonardo Wilhelm DiCaprio and Kate Winslet are so attractive actor.

2210,greendaydagger,Lingering Feeling at the End,10,12 June 2008,"The first time I saw this movie was when I was four years old and my mother covered my eyes at almost every scene. Naturally, I remembered how sad the movie was. Something that wouldn't happen for a four year old with most movies though, was that the movie had such a great effect that even years later when I heard the song that was playing at the end I felt sad. Just recently, I re-watched the movie and was blown away. We've all seen movies that leave you with a feeling afterward, whether it be one of happiness, sadness, or anger. This left the viewer with all three of these emotions. It's not hard to guess why it would leave you with a feeling of sadness, but I'd like to point out how strong this lingering feeling was. I cried not only during the whole last hour of the movie, but for thirty minutes afterward as well. I'll admit, I cry easily over movies, but usually the tears stop coming after the first two rounds. The ending of the movie was just amazing. This is left for the viewer to interpret, but when the old lady closes her eyes and the scene shoots to the men on the titanic opening the door for her and Jack is standing at the top of the stairs next to the clock the ending is just turned over from a depressing movie to a very happy one, depending on the readers interpretation. It can be implied that perhaps she is dreaming of him, or she dreams of him every night, but this isn't quite so happy. The reader could also look at it from a logical point of view and say that this is the dream people have in their last 12 minutes of brain activity when they die. However, the most happy and perhaps most common interpretation is that she has indeed died and she is now off to spend an eternity with Jack, her only true love. The movie leaves you with a feeling of anger because you know that Jack didn't have to die. You know that nobody had to die, but the maker of the ship had insisted on going faster and the people loading the safety boats didn't ""Want to risk putting too much weight on"" so while they could have fit 65 people on each they stuck with close to 12. You know, also, that if the dang boats hadn't been so selfish towards the end he wouldn't have died. This is by far the best movie I have ever seen and I would recommend it to anyone.",Titanic

I enjoy his work because his not like other actors who are like the same character in movies,, but he's acting chooses do change. And I don't know of another actress who could have played the role of Rose as Kate Winslet did. I also don't remember being bored of watching this movie. My first time watching it, when i was young, I do remember my folks taking me to the picture and I didn't know what was going to happen next, but it made you wonder. And unlike other 'Titanic' movies, this movie makes you want go and meet the director, James Cameron. As I watch movies, sometimes in my head I'll be like, the camera would have gotten a better picture of the set if i had been placed at a different angle.

What makes the movie unforgettable is not only the great story line but also the talented direction of James Cameron. To me, the time when Titanic went down under the freezing water was the climax of the movie. At that moment, the director did a great job in expressing the feeling of thousand souls fighting against the death. The sinking scene appears to be extremely realistic and touching. Each action of each figure bears many implied meaning. They depict one true's identity when trying to survive. They have different actions. Aristocrats, who always hide their nature or act above others, they refuse to wear the life vests because of its informality. However, at the end, they cannot hide their fears or tears.The musicians decide to play regardless of the chaos. Why? They want to be faithful with ""Music"", the source of their life. This is a very touching scene. This shows us great love in a different kind, a kind that is way above others: Love is beyond fears.

So is happening with Titanic which is different from Ben Hur because there are some 50 years of evolution, now we have special effects, better visual effects and sound editing and so on, but the both movies are epic with huge budget, many actors and people involved in the project, great story; both movies deserve their appreciation and prizes, and the best critics in the world know that. In my opinion, these two are the best movies ever made; everything is spectacular and fascinating at them; i watch them with a great pleasure every time and i wonder why can't we see often movies like these.",Titanic

Every one I know has seen it and regardless if it was a male of female, all admitted to shedding a few to this movie.

That relationship was only a vehicle for the main purpose of the film. That purpose being what the passengers of the Titanic went through during this horrific tragedy.My husband and I had no desire to see this film when it came out. We thought, ""Yeah, yeah... big ship, iceberg, sank, a lot of people died. We already know the story."" We were so wrong. We were put into the shoes of those poor souls who were unfortunate enough to be of the wrong class (steerage). We saw those who knew there was no hope and waited to die. We went through the terror that each one of those passengers went through. And we saw the shame and disgust of those that let people die just to save themselves.At the end of this film, we sat with tears in our eyes and could only say, ""I never knew.""",Titanic

The moving love story of two very different people from opposites sides of the class rank proving against all odds that they love each other until the last moment he slips away from her grasp, and her forever holding on to him in her heart. This love story moves audience members beyond any other love story ever told enrapturing us all in their world aboard the most famous ship of all time. This movie never fails to bring me to tears even though it is long since been engraved that she does in fact ""let go"" This moving love story transcends time bring countless generations aboard the first and last voyage of the grand Titanic, all the while giving us a ride one of the sweetest romances of all time. With this dream cast and some of the best looking scenery ever recreated to enhance the looks of Titanic.

I has shocked to see Titanic was not on this list. this is the reason why the 250 can lose some validity when people say the movies on the list are not the 'best' movies. now I understand some films are fan boy films and cult films. I beg all users to vote for ten stars for a movie that not only should be on the list but in the top twenty five if not the top ten(Dark Knight wasn't that great) this film has one the most Oscars than any other film(tied for 1st in a three way tie) Vote Ten Maybe I'm just a huge JC fan but this film needs to be on top 250",Titanic
2224,BethanyTedder,The biggest problem I found with the movie,8,25 December 2002,"was that I was more interested in the historical aspect of what had happened to the Titanic since I was 10. The love story was not a factor to me in seeing the movie. But I could pick out with great clarity the historical errors such as the one between Robert Hitchens and Molly Brown in the lifeboat. There was no way that the Molly Brown that we knew would have sit down and not taken action on her own. Also, the last time we saw John Jacob Astor was near the grand stair case leading one to believe this is where he died. He was actually hit with the falling smoke stack that we saw hit a third class passenger. The number of musicians were cut down from 8 to 5 I believe it was. And the burning question in my mind is, ""Where was the Californian?"" that sat about 10 miles away and didn't do a thing to help these people. All I remember seeing was the rescuing ship, the ""Carpathia"". There is controversy to this day as to whether William Murdock committed suicide. And since his body was never found, we will never know. Also there is controversy as to whether any passengers that were out of hand were shot by him or anyone else. About the best I can say for the characters of Cal and Ruth were that they showed with great clarity the attitude of the first class passengers towards the lower class of people. But on the real Titanic, Jack Dawson would not have been allowed to roam the whole ship nor make several contacts with builder, Thomas Andrews. But I do have to say that they opening underwater shots of the sunken Titanic were great. As for Jack and Rose, I believe had James Cameron dug deep enough, he could have found a ship romance that he could have used for the movie and it be a real romance. Of course, it probably would not have crossed class lines.",Titanic
2225,sherow20,This Movie Did Not Sink,9,12 July 2009,"The ship may have sunk but the movie didn't!!! Director, James Cameron, from 'The Terminator' did it again with this amazing picture. One of my favorite scenes is 'The Dinner table' scene, in which Rose's family and friends meet Jack after he saves her. Rose has a look on her face that every woman should have when you meet 'THE ONE'...I hope I have that look when I am in the room with my future husband.Jack and Rose have a connection that is 'MOVIE STUFF' but it's good movie stuff. We have the greedy mom and all her elite stuck up associates who live off of their husbands wealth. Rose almost commits suicide but the Gilbert Grape star rescues her. I really liked the hanging over the boat scene. It was a good risk.The movie is long but it's fantastic!!! Good story, good flow, good actors!!! Go see it twice if you want, Its worth it!!!",Titanic
2226,barbaralgeorge,Great movie!,10,3 August 2009,"This film is about a love triangle that happens on the Titanic. The Titanic, the ship of dreams, is also known as ""The Unsinkable"". Rose leaves her rich fiancé Caledon Hockley for this poor artist, Jack. However, the Titanic collides with an Iceberg and sinks on April 15th, 1912 at 2:20 in the morning. Surprisingly, Jack dies and Rose survives. Eighty-four years later, Rose tells the story about her life on Titanic to her grand daughter and friends and explains the first sight of Jack-how she fell in love and how they fought for survival.The theme of the movie is that love is worth more than material things. Cameron uses real actors that some people believe is based on a true story. Written in 1912, the dialogue is appropriate for the time period. Located in the Atlantic Ocean, this movie was actually based on some real occurrences. The film's soundtrack made the movie more enjoyable, especially the song by Celine Dion ""My Heart Will Go On"".",Titanic
2227,juliasayswhaat,Titanic,10,17 September 2009,"Titanic was an amazing movie and although it was extremely long, it is definitely worth watching. Titanic is a very well written movie based on a true story. It is about a ship that sunk in the middle of the ocean, and barely anybody survived. It is a love story between two people, that ended sad. But the movie made you cry, laugh, smile. It had comedy, drama, love, and any other drama you could think of, it was amazing. I could watch this movie everyday because it never gets old. I think it is good for all ages, and at some point in all your lives, you should watch it. I didn't watch it until this year, and i don't know how i lived without seeing it. I would recommend this movie to anyone looking for a romantic love story.",Titanic

I am an 18-year-old male who usually despises romantic love stories. Regardless of this in my eyes the chemistry between Rose and Jack, respectable acting and a surprisingly convincing and moving storyline is unprecedented in film history. I critique movies all the time although sometimes the public and critics must look past technological superiority and complex story lines to enjoy the simplicity, emotionally affecting and timeless storyline of a film like Titanic. So please don't notice the glitches and problems with Cameron's filmmaking that people so often point out because it was over 10 years ago, a fantastic watch and the highest grossing film for a reason!!!",Titanic

It's a film which will not only strike you in the tear-ducts, but in heart as well. It gets a lot of criticism for reasons I can't seem to find cogent, maybe it's because certain users favourite movies haven't made as much as this at the box office? I don't know. But either way, does an over-hyped film that didn't live up to it's expectations make it horrible? Absolutely not. And just because you don't like the artist, it doesn't mean you can't appreciate the work. The film isn't supposed to be based upon facts, the Titanic was the foundation used to build one of the greatest love stories in film history. It'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and most of all, it will leave a lasting finish on you, whether it's a good finish, or a bad one; the music, the emotion, everything about this film will make you want to grab the person next to you and tell them you love them.

Surely they weren't around in 1912? -Young Rose has green eyes, but Old Rose has blue eyes. Later in the film, there is a fade between the faces of young & old Rose and this time old Rose's have magically changed to match Kate Winslet's eyes-After Rose has helped Jack to get loose from where he is handcuffed, as he is jumping over a bench one minute he has the handcuffs on, the next shot they're gone. Then they're back. -After Rose breaks Jack's handcuffs below decks and both race down the hallways outrunning the rising water. Rose is clearly wearing white sneakers yet she is seen 30 seconds later wearing period shoes when Jack retrieves the gate key that the crewman dropped beneath the rising water.There are too many of them, so I'l stop here!

I am not usually emotional when it comes to movies, but to be honest, I found myself crying my eyeballs out when I first watched ""Titanic."" It is unquestionably a masterpiece. Every single part of that movie elegantly coheres with the rest of it.  The love story, occurring during such tragic event as the sinking of titanic, truly reveals the power of pure love and the risks one is willing to take in order to save it. The acting was great.  Kate Winslet is quite a dramatic actress and after this movie, she became one of my favorites.  Personally, I am not a big fan of DiCaprio, but I don't think he made this film worse in any way.This film is a phenomenal masterpiece, but it was way to overexposed which caused denial in many people.

Kate Winslet (rose) was a perfect woman for the job, i only wish that i was in love with this person in such a manner but of course nothing like this happening (lol, might sound kind of creepy but i hope not in a negative way) anyways, this movie is by far my most favorite i think that it completely smashes every movie including ""Avatar"" into little bits. however, i found that this movie will always be my favorite. i feel like after watching this film that i kind of seek a love that is with a person like Kate Winslet in this film but as life is not perfect it will only be a dream. lol, i almost forgot that this was a review, lol, but overall, this is a great movie to watch over and over, and over.i also believe that this would be a great film to watch over and over again 1,000 years from now even 100 years from now, i believe that this film will still be the best film ever created, produced, and imagined. and like the love in this film i believe that the heart will go on. i highly recommend, that you see this film.",Titanic

I don't like to go to the movies so I didn't care much about it. However, as the weeks passed my interest on going to watch the movie increased. Finally, one day my family invited me to go see it, and I decided to go to the theater. The movie impressed me a lot, it was sincerely wonderful. I still remember the scene when Jack took Rose to the end of the ship, and she opened her arms, while a beautiful song played and the wind hit her hair. The fact that the romantic story developed from a historical event made the movie more interesting. The effects that portrayed the crash and sink of the Titanic ship were incredible. Finally, the end of the movie seemed as sad as it had to have been when thousands of people lost their lives when the ship sank in 1912.

A movie does not make $1.8 billion dollars world wide with out being incredible brilliant.Titanic is more than just a movie about a ship that sinks its a classic romance love story about a rich girl and a poor boy. An unspoken love that could never truly be. The rich girl who is trapped in her high class elegant lifestyle forced to marry a wealthy man who she does not love. Then by happenstance she runs into Jack Dawson and their love develops from there.The acting is magnificent. The movie was very well written and no expense was spared in bring Titanic back to life.

Instead you sat back and admired the clever way the director filmed the ship filling up with water - how it burst through ceilings and doors and whooshed its way along the corridors. Surely we were meant to feel for the poor panic-stricken passengers?- the director obviously didn't.As for the romance between Leo and Kate - they have to be one of the most mismatched couples in movie history.

2243,luvrokk,Couldn't Have Been Better:,10,25 June 2010,"I'm just a fifteen year old with a large amount of study behind myself. I saw this movie at first when my dad purchased it in 1998 when I was three. When I grew up a little, I thought the acting was brilliant throughout. I was completely mesmerized by the film. When I was old enough to understand the movie and history behind Titanic, I took advantage of the opportunity to study it. I learned the true facts and I cannot get enough. The event has been the focus of study time outside of school for about seven years. This movie inspired me to go out and study the ship and time period in history... Yes it's a romantic tragedy, and Leonardo Dicaprio is quite attractive and Kate Winslet is so gorgeous, I'm jealous! But I don't think that they were the main part... Titanic, the disaster was the true focus in this film. If Cameron were to create a documentary, how many movie goers would he get to see Titanic? Not many... So throw in a heart-wrenching romance for crying out loud! It's Hollywood, everyone knows it won't be COMPLETELY factual, they're going to try to get as many movie goers as possible. The movie was so greatly recognized because its a perfect ratio of occasional humor, tension, thrilling race of survival, and the kind of love that everyone dreams of having (that ends in this life with Jack, but continues in Roses heart forever). On that note of love continuing forever in a person's heart, ""My Heart Will Go On"" is my number one favorite song ever. Celine has got the most wonderful voice I've ever heard and she was definitely right for the theme song of the most moving movie of all time. I live in a town that isn't too diverse, besides money. Here, you're wealthy or poor. Not too many in between... and the 1st and 3rd class attitudes toward each other don't differ much from in the movie and in my hometown. The part of Titanic that gets me besides the facts/history is courage in the face of danger (as said on the cover of most copies of Titanic). The bow scene when Rose lets herself go into Jack and ""soars into a night without fear"" (on the script) shows how quickly passengers and crew were taken by surprise, as they feared nothing on the most glorious ship in the world. The disaster of Titanic is something I view as a sign to not get too comfortable, to never challenge nature; Titanic justifies just this. Hitting back on the movie itself, Titanic couldn't have been better. Casting was amazing, effects were brilliant beyond belief, and the story is a winner. Honestly, if this movie weren't made, I would of recognized the study of Titanic as my first love; but it wouldn't have been stunted as quickly as it was after seeing the film. -Brilliant acting. -Great casting. -Amazing effects. -Tragedy/Romance. -A little history. What more could you ask for in a movie? Good job Cameron, couldn't have been done better.",Titanic

2248,ImGraped,A Theme that Transcends Expectations,10,3 January 2011,"As with all movies to date, there are a plethora of people that simply adore Titanic, there are a multitude of people that utterly despise Titanic, and there are many more in between. Those that are infatuated with this movie comment on its brilliant acting, cunning storyline, and sad yet epic finale. Those believing this movie is garbage comment on its lack of an original plot, boring script, and historical inaccuracy. And yet again, there are many more explanations in between the two extremes.Personally, I believe there is something within this movie that transcends all of the above arguments. It's a very basic theme: losing the one you love. The actors, in this case, are just devices, clichéd personalities to which many people can relate. Although DiCaprio's and Winslet's acting was in my opinion brilliant, that is irrelevant. All they had to do was become relatable, which they did perfectly.The reason this theme is so powerful, however, is because it is inevitable in life. That's not being pessimistic; that is just fact. All humans die eventually, and all humans love at one time or another (except for the psychopaths). The depressing truth is that one day, your loved one and yourself will be separated, either through death, hatred, or some other factor. Basically, love is not eternal in this physical realm. That is what makes this movie so powerful. People begin to see themselves in the main characters, and with Rose's loss comes the viewer's loss. With Jack's death come's the viewer's pain. I can still remember those three fateful words at the closure of the movie: ""Don't let go."" That truly captures the movie as a whole, and offers a reconciliation for this depressing theme. All in all, regardless of the acting, the setting, the historical accuracy, the plot, the storyline, or any other facet of the movie, this theme is ageless, and allows this movie to be a brilliant masterpiece.10/10, easily. One of, if not, my favorite.",Titanic
2249,hydie-dunkle,Love stories do arise with tragedy!,6,3 February 2011,"The film is an American romance/disaster film created to bring attention to the untold stories of the passengers aboard the RMS Titanic.Camera angles used in the making put the viewer aboard the ship right along side of the other passengers. The lighting and sound effects are used in a way that put the final touches on one of the greatest films ever made. Characters were chosen perfectly, Kate Winslett playing Rose DeWitt Bukater and Leonardo DiCaprio playing the drifter, Jack Dawson. The two play out a love story throughout the film in the midst of the tragedy of the sinking ship. The director, James Cameron, had his work cut out for him in making this film, but he did a tremendous job.",Titanic
2250,jdukes02,Review of Titanic,10,6 February 2011,"For as long as I can remember I have been fascinated with the story of the Titanic. When I was a child I watched everything I could from TV documentaries to repeats of ""A Night to Remember"". I remember the excitement I felt when they finally found the sunken ship that had been missing for over 70 years. So, when I saw the first previews of James Cameron's movie about the Titanic in 1997, I was very interested in seeing it. That was until I heard that it was going to be a love story. Once I heard that, I was split on whether or not I wanted to see it. However, after reading more about the movie and the detail that was put into recreating the events of that fateful night, my interest was renewed. Cameron did an excellent job of blending a fictional story, albeit a love story, with the actual stories of the Titanic. His accurate use of facts such as a woman over hearing Ismay suggesting to the captain to light the last boilers. In that seen you can see a woman seated behind the two as she hears him tell the captain this. Another, is the story of the chef who survived the sinking. It is a well known fact that he was intoxicated at the time of the sinking, and that witnesses say that he stayed on the ship until the very end. But more importantly, I believe that through the use of a love story that connects with the viewer, Cameron was able to tell the story of all the lives that where lost that night and the pain that they must have felt. I know the movie made an impact on me, and not because of the love story, but because for the first time I saw the true story of the loss of life that happened that night.",Titanic
2251,shann135,Gorgeous Film!!,10,9 April 2012,"I saw Titanic on the big screen 15 years ago and fell in love with it. Since then, I have seen it a few times on TV, as well as watched it in VHS or DVD, and have continued to enjoy it very much. The 3D effects were okay, didn't matter to me, it was great to watch this beautiful film again on the big screen. It still moves me to tears, everything about the movie, including the breathtaking scenes, the touching love story, the gorgeous musical score, the amazing effects that are still impressive 15 years later. One of my favourite movies of all time, no doubt! Don't go to this movie looking for flaws, go see this movie with an open heart and let it sweep you away!!! James Cameron is a movie making genius!!!",Titanic
2252,cartman2181,"quite possibly the most overrated movie of the 90s, maybe even all time",7,7 July 2003,"A lot of people seem to think that ""Titanic"" is an overrated movie because of Leonardo DiCaprio and the whole LeoMania deal.  Well, it's not. DiCaprio's performance in the movie is very good.  In fact, I seem to remember thinking he was robbed of an Oscar nom.  DiCaprio is a good actor. If you don't believe me, then watch ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?,"" ""Celebrity,"" and to a lesser extent, ""The Man in the Iron Mask.""
Moving on.The reason this film is so overrated is the screenplay.  The screenplay is God-awful.  If you recall, the screenplay didn't even get an Oscar nom. This is probably the only movie ever to win Best Picture to hold that distinction, and will probably remain that way.  There are a ton of lines that are stupid, dumb, inaccurate for the time, and just plain worthless. The screenplay also helps create a bunch of clichéd characters.  Cameron might be able to direct great spectacle, but his writing skills are lacking. Kinda like George Lucas, only Lucas can't direct too well anymore either.The supporting performances are also wildly uneven.  Both leads are good, by the way.  As for the supporters, Kathy Bates, Victor Garber, Jonathyn Hyde, and Gloria Stuart all do well.  But the much larger roles of Billy Zane and Frances Fisher are horrible.  It doesn't help that their characters are clichéd to the max, but sometimes good performances can make characters seem less clichéd.  These two fail miserably here.  Usually they're good in their roles.  But here it's just bad.  Especially Billy Zane.  If he wants to promote his filmography, he should really mention ""The Phantom"" before this one.The movie is great spectacle, however.  The scenes of the ship sinking are amazing.  This is probably the most accurate depiction of the disaster that will ever be seen.  After all, ""A Night To Remember"" didn't show the ship splitting in two, which we know now happened.  So the movie is handled incredibly well in this respect.  You do feel like you're on the ship itself.  The sets are exquisite.  Beautiful to say the least.  You do get an idea for how majestic the ship was.Another problem I have with the movie is the very overrated Celine Dion song and James Horner's score.  If you this is the only work of Horner's that you've ever heard, then you're missing a lot.  ""Glory"" and ""Apollo 13"" are far better scores than the repetitive themes of this movie.Overall, ""Titanic"" is a solid movie.  Not great, but not horrible.  It's a 7/10.  It did not deserve to win Best Picture.  That honor should have gone to ""L.A. Confidential.""",Titanic
2253,pizzalover10489,Loved it!,10,4 September 2003,"*May include spoilersThe movie Titanic (1997) is an outstanding example of something old brought to life again. James Cameron (writer/director) gives us the story of two lovers, Rose and Jack, fighting to stay together, and eventually fighting to survive. Cameron's well-written and well thought out script went on to become one of the most admirable films of all time, also winning eleven Academy Awards. Cameron's playwriting talent shines from the moment we see the submersibles diving down to the wreck, to the moment Rose is rescued. This story will leave you sitting on the edge of your seat till the very end. If you are not interested in romance, the amazing special effects and the action-packed second half will leave you loving the movie from right after the moment it ends. This movie will make you laugh and cry, it will leave you angry, awed, and perhaps even frightened, but most of all it will touch your heart. You will feel as though you were there on that night, as you watch the ship from the time it hits the iceberg, right until it slips beneath the waves. I strongly recommend this movie for anyone who wants a romantic movie, and a heart-pounding adventure.",Titanic
2254,dbbilby,"Good portrayal of a ship, less that admirable plot.",5,12 August 2003,"I think that one thing about this film that is easily overlooked is that Cameron brings us a very accurate and realistic portrayal of the ship itself and the disaster that resulted from negligence of the ship's designers and crew.  However, it is served up in a story that focuses on useless and unrealistic dialogue, essentially a generic love story that is written to cater to the masses. The film is written such that we see the modern day underwater wreckage at the beginning of the film, as much as we may see on a half hour special on the discovery channel, then transitions to the past to show us the ship in all of its grandeur.  The love story leads to a romp of the ship, showing all of the types of passengers, their quarters, and how they lived aboard the ship during the short trip across the Atlantic.  Cameron also managed to show us all the major parts of the ship, including the decks, the engine, and the storage areas.  To weave all of this into the story is a notable accomplishment in itself. The film falters in its attempt of a realistic portrayal of attitudes and ideas during the time in which it is set.  Many ideas and actions that are not true to the time period penetrate the plot, as Cameron attempts to tell a historic story in a fashion that is tailored for audiences nearly a century later.  The result is a more of a fantasy meets documentary than a realistic film. People who enjoy the love story tend to proport that this is a good film. Since there is so much focus on the DiCaprio-Winslet superstar combination, however, others will overlook the accurate portrayal and the realistic sets, and claim that the movie is a waste of tape.  Although Cameron managed to woo love stricken audiences, he fell short of reality on the plot.",Titanic

The special-effects were really stunning especially if you remind yourself that it was made in 1997. Also the plot was brilliant as it wasn't just an every-day love story with a happily ever-after, but a dramatic devastating end. However Titanic is a must-see film.",Titanic
2257,afselb,greatest movie ever made,10,4 November 2011,i don't care what this so called critics think about this film.personally i fell that this is the greatest movie ever made in the entire film industry of this planet.A touching and a memorable love story that every one keeps in their minds and a true incident of a disaster told in very heart full way.i think everyone watched dis movie will justify that.Am just disappointed to see such a low rating given to this film.There are many films IMDb with ratings above 9 that doesn't come any where near to this film.I don't want to name those films but this a true injustice done to this film after giving a true film for us to keep in our minds for the rest our lifes,Titanic

2259,June81,Titanic is my all time favorite film,10,12 October 2003,"Titanic is my all time favorite film and the very best film of the last ten years. Leonardo DiCaprio is magnificent as Jack. The direction, art direction and cinematography are all top notch. Titanic is easily the best film of the last ten years worthy of it's 11 Oscars and rank as all time box office champ. No film of the last ten years comes anywhere near Titanic.",Titanic
2260,mcnasioutzik,Why is it suddenly cool to hate this epic?,10,17 March 2014,"Over the years, it seems that people love to hate Titanic. Despite it's 11 Oscars and the fact that it is one of the largest ever box office successes(I think 5th, adjusting for inflation), over the years its almost as if its cool to hate Titanic. That the love story and the characters are cliché and soppy and the story is completely unrealistic. That only romantic, love-obsessed girls would watch it and cry about how they'll never get a man as gorgeous as Leonardio DiCaprio. The 'draw me like one of your French girls' is probably one of the most made fun of scenes in a movie that I've ever heard. These people fail to realize that Titanic is a movie. It's not supposed to be realistic - it shows a blown up, exaggerated version of reality to capture our imagination and our hearts. And it succeeds impressively. Leonardo DiCaprio is good, but not his best (watch The Departed or Wolf of Wall Street for Leo's acting abilities). Kate Winslet was probably slightly better. But the magic about Titanic is the story and the directing. From the beginning, the characters captivate you. They are not superficial - in contrary, they have flaws and advantages, just like everyone else. The movie is long but the pace is not slow. Every scene is necessary and Cameron does a great job in making us want this couple to make it. I don't need to mention that the music is exceptional, complimenting the atmosphere perfectly. The effects are good and very realistic (it shows that Cameron actually visited the Titanic before filming). Most of all, it is apparent that this movie is an epic. I definitely consider it as one of the best love stories of recent time. It is a little cliché and a little soppy, but I promise you won't regret watching it. So ignore the haters and go and enjoy it for what it is: a romantic drama with amazing characters, music, directing and background. Even if you hate it, at least you'll be able to laugh about it with your friends!",Titanic
2261,xsvg4c,Great special effects among nothing other than complete junk.,2,1 November 2003,"I'm sorry folks.  You can't rate a movie based on teenage emotions.  Yes, the special effects were great, but that's where it stops.  Awful soundtrack, awful acting, and much less a story that should remain in the history books only.  This movie is much like a Camaro, Mustang, or Cavalier...maybe it wouldn't be so bad if it had anything unique about it, but, oh well, it didn't.",Titanic
2262,theburlyone,This is an excellent film in all respects.,10,15 December 2013,"I know that nowadays Titanic is seen as kind of a clichéd romance movie, but that's just not the case. Yes, romance is a large part of the plot but it is tasteful and very well done. I really don't understand why people knock this movie down... Not only is James Cameron a master film maker, DiCaprio and Winslett are both excellent actors. In fact, everyone in this movie down to the extras make this film a completely immersible experience. As for the cons, there really isn't any unless you're a history buff. In that case you should be reminded that this a very theatrical film and the creators took certain liberties. Anyway, beyond the review, yes... This movie did move me to tears and yes, I am a man. For Pete's sake, my nickname is Burly for a reason and I shed tears if that tells you anything about how this movie can rouse your emotions. What else is sad is that this movie, at the time of this review only has 7.5/10 on IMDb. It's not even on IMDb's top 250. Advice for movie lovers: If you haven't seen it, see it. If you've already seen it, watch it again if you have the time. Titanic gets a 10/10 in my book.",Titanic
2263,towaaaannddaa,A Sweeping Epic that Continues to Enchant Me,10,8 January 2012,"Titanic is simply one of the greatest films I have ever seen. The historical detail is almost spot on, and though the script may have it's faults to some (like ""Jack"" and ""Rose"" being repeated too often), I think that if you put it in context with the story it all works out. James Cameron did a brilliant job, as this movie haunts me even weeks after I see it. Titanic follows Rose DeWitt Bukater (Kate Winslet), a young socialite, and Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio), a carefree and penniless artist from Wisconsin. After Jack prevents Rose from throwing herself off of the ship, they fall into a passionate love, all the while trying to avoid Rose's fiancé who is nearly twice her age, Cal Hockley (Billy Zane). But as the Titanic sinks, Rose struggles with the will to survive or the intense need to be with Jack. Titanic was such a success because it portrays the great disaster through emotions, not simply stating facts. We smile with the characters as Rose and Jack fall in love. We grind our teeth in frustration when Cal and Mrs. Dewitt Butaker try everything to tear Jack and Rose apart, we feel heartbroken with Rose when she finds that Jack succumbed to the cold. It is the fact that we feel the event that makes this so sweeping. Titanic is not simply a love story, it's a show of raw emotions and loss and love and the fact that everything the men who built the ship believed proved to be false.",Titanic
2264,bernps23,Words cant describe it :),10,29 November 2011,"Based off of the true sinking of the steam liner in 1912, James Camerons' 1996 Titanic is a tragic love story of two teenagers who fall in love on the tragic ship. Rose DeWitt Bukater (Rose) is a first-class passenger who is engaged to a wealthy man named Cal, while Jack Dawson is a third- class passenger who with his best friend won his boarding ticket in a lucky hand of poker. While Rose tries to commit suicide because of her unhappy life Jack stops her and from then their friendship begins. It quickly turns into a romance after Rose sees what an exciting life she could be living as a third-class passenger. Although her fiancé tries to keep her away from him, Rose still manages to stay with Jack up until the very end as Titanic hits an iceberg and slips away into the darkness. Unfortunately Jack makes Rose promise that she will never give up hope and he eventually dies from the extreme cold.This movie has gotten nothing but endless criticism, but the fact is that it is a movie for the ages. The movie has numerous messages but the central one is the ability to trust a complete stranger with your life even in the darkest and most terrifying of times. The first time you see this movie it completely changes the way you perceive things about not only love but about life. Two strangers from different social classes fall in love on a ship after only knowing each other for a few days. Despite all their differences and difficulties they manage to stay together until the very end. This movie proves that trust conquers everything.Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet fit into their roles wonderfully. Kate, who plays Rose, is able to transition into the role of a damsel in distress perfectly. Leonardo, who plays Jack, has a trusting face and charming appeal. Both are able to pull of their roles beautifully and are very excellent actors. Billy Zane, who plays the evil but charming Cal, puts some tension in the movie which makes the story only more suspenseful as it already it.James Cameron created a film that is so moving that still to this date is one of the highest grossing films of all time, only being beaten by the film Avatar which was also a James Cameron production. There are a countless number of love stories that all have the same happily ever after ending but this story has a twist and it might play a part to the movie being so memorable. This movie brought a whole new interest in not only the horrible tragedy that unfolded in that fateful spring morning of 1912 but also to romance of these two lovers who everyone believes are true historical facts.Every time I watch this movie I see or learn something new. It is the only movie that I will always remember about because it moves me in ways that words cannot describe. James Cameron makes us feel deeply about ideas and things we rarely dare to imagine and therefore I give this movie a 10/10 rating.",Titanic
2265,esor3,Timeless and beautiful,10,12 December 2011,"I know that this movie is pretty much half loved and half hated by the world. The first time I watched it I was 5 years old, I didn't really understand any of it at that age except the fact that there was a boy, a girl and a sinking ship. I then again watched it when I was about 10 or 11, I really started to have an interest in the history of Titanic and of course Leo DiCaprio. Every time it was on TV I would watch the whole thing.I fell in love with it, by the time I was the age I am now (15)I had known the movie by heart and understood every aspect of it. This movie is very close to my heart in so many ways. Some people might say, of course you love this movie your 15 and all you have on your mind is hot boys and love. I love it for many other reasons though, too many to list.I have heard many opinions on Titanic, most were negative. The people who disliked it though hadn't seemed to understand it quite well. Maybe you have to see it a couple of times to really understand it. So if you have never seen this movie, go see it in 3D in April 2012. It's definitely worth watching, you might hate it, but I really recommend it. Everyone says the whole 3D thing is ""over rated"", but I think it will make the already great special effects even better. I have also never seen it on the big screen so I am extra excited. Over all I love this movie, it's unfortunate that it gets so much hatred.",Titanic
2266,bish-bash-bosh-reez,"You'll ""never let go"" to this grand masterpiece!",10,8 December 2011,"Some of you may know James Cameron more for making his bad boy type films for example: The Terminator, Aliens, Rambo, and True Lies. This film is so much different to those, but in an extraordinary way, this is how I like to see Cameron, making films at top notch! So you've got your basic love couple, one from a rich family, and one living down in the dumps. But the cheesy love story is so much more than that because it takes place on one of the grandest most commonly known ships to ever set sail... TITANIC! Aside from the cheesiness Cameron gets you involved into the history of Titanic in the first 10 minutes of the film, starting with old Rose and her adventures aboard ship at the mere age of just seventeen, and how she meets the young teen heart throb 'jack' (Leonardo DiCaprio). There relationship gradually gets higher throughout the film until finally there hormone crazed minds decide to put it down to the core and fall in love. Not only is she finding it hard to live on the wealthy side of the land because her Mother is loosing money and needs Rose to get married to the evil fiancé 'Cal'. But as the truth comes out the story is forgotten as the star-crossed lovers suffer a more terrible threat, an iceberg smashing into the ship dawning to its death. This magical love story is put behind as Rose and Jack conjure the rising waters and Cal's crazed jealousy washed with a gorgeous tone, melodrama, and dazzling special effects as the once happy couple are taking a thrilling race for survival. This is a definite must for all Cameron lovers, trust me. In my opinion this is better than Avatar (and that's coming from a Cameron crazed lover) the effects are out of this world for the date it actually came out. Seriously if you have not yet seen it, come out from under that rock and get down the store and buy a copy!",Titanic

To me the great effects and great cast is wasted on drab and idiotic love story.  I didn't see why we needed to have an action movie thrown into a tragic event. The sight of Billy Zane as a jealous lover trying to kill Leo, was absurd and in a way hilarious.  I think Cameron's interest in the history of the ship is what carries this movie.  His affection for this event is seen in every detail of the movie.  For me I found myself cheering for Leo and Kate to die ,so I didn't have to sit through more of there banter.

2272,riddhiman-mukherjee-292-625680,Titanic 3D (2012)- Absolute nostalgia !!!,9,10 April 2012,"First of all, I was overwhelmed with nostalgia, when I learned that Titanic(1997) is returning to theatres! It is a favourite movie of mine, hearkening back to those years when I was a relatively young, unspoilt kid. who had no idea what the 'Big Bad World' was like( I was an 11 year old boy when 'Titanic' was released on 'March 1998' here in India). I had went to see Titanic being impressed by the huge ship, the story . My father had booked tickets at Globe Cinema Hall(Esplanade Kolkata- now closed)a week beforehand. But my mother, learning about ""certain"" scenes , persuaded my father to return the tickets. But as desperate I was back then to see the film,I had quietly removed the tickets from his Office- Bag and hid it. When He learned of it, instead of scolding me, he decided to keep the tickets. I remember feeling extremely awkward during the painting and the car scene, trying to hide my eyes, and still daring to peer through my fingers. But Titanic moved me, totally. It was a wonderful Romantic film, and the power of love and the inevitable tragedy had brought tears to my 11 year old self back then. And oh, the music! I remember when the movie had finished and the credits started rolling with the famous song, everyone was exiting the theatre. I was stuck there , with tears frozen in my cheeks, unable to move, unwilling to leave. I felt so lost so saddened. The tag line really hit home for me- "" Nothing on Earth could come between them"" Some of my friends have found the movie to be nothing more than a disaster picture, some have found it to be a moving love story that is universal. Watching the 3D version was reliving those memories! It wasn't as affecting as it was back in '98 but it was surely nostalgic. The 3D post-conversion was brilliant, I mean really good, But I imagine it to look no less better in its original 2D version. Though the 3D was never distracting, it felt almost as good as that of 'Avatar'.Depth was stunning! And the newly 4K restored print sparkled with fine details. But now my BIG complaint- (""SPOILER AHEAD"") - The nude-sketching scene of Rose, was unjustly, and badly censored. any instances of Kate Winslets Breast or lower torso was removed, zoomed-in, pan-scanned. Even the kiss, after Rose says thank you and takes the painting was cut. It totally put me off. I lost my interest in watching the movie. They raped the artistic integrity of the movie, right there! It was such a beautiful and sweet scene. I read reports that the censor board of India passed the film uncut, hence I was shocked to see such abominable censoring. But then this is not just India, this is a part of India- The state of West Bengal, and anything can happen here.Is a Woman's body still an object of shame??? Well I don't know if the particular Cinema owners did that or not, which I doubt, but still this is by all accounts unacceptable. I guess most of you living outside India( at least in the US, UK, Aus, Eu) are lucky enough to see the movie in an Un-Raped form. However in spite of all this the charm of the movie remains undeniable, even after fourteen years('98 release in India).I watched it on 10th April, 2012, exactly a hundred years after the ship sailed from Southampton (April 10th, 1912). And intend on catching it once again on the 15th: a hundred years after it sank(April 15th, 1912). May all the souls who perished on the night find peace, and all those whose lives were changed forever after the disaster. And RIP Gloria Stuart !",Titanic

2276,acbaker-327-134602,A Perfect 10/10,10,25 March 2012,"Even after fifteen years Titanic is still talked about so much. James Cameron has made this movie so big that even kids in elementary school know who Leonardo DiCaprio is. This film is more than just a love story, and many people will agree. The special effects that appear in this movie are spectacular. Well honestly if you're going to spend over $200 million dollars on making a film, it should be at least spectacular. The real reason this movie was excellent was because of Jim Cameron's undying devotion to the project's perfection. He did countless retakes of key scenes, got behind the camera himself many times, and made sure every part of the movie matched the picture in his mind. The acting is brilliant, based on a true story, probably more than half of the consumers that watch the film will share tears, thanks to an imaginable ending which can never be forgotten. Well if you haven't seen this film you're missing out on something historical, and a film to idolize for Hollywood. Could it get better? No. Not at all. The most moving film of all time. See for yourself then you will understand. A landmark. (Don't be surprised if you cry too) 10/10 hands down.",Titanic

And I love Titanic and I love their big story.When I saw this movie,I excited because DeCaprio was at this movie! Also Kate Winslet was at this movie,too. But I didn't know Winslet when I watched. But I impressed from her. Because she was great! When I watched,I cried.Of course! Titanic is the best love story I have ever seen. The effects are perfect.Players and team are perfect,too.I think, it isn't just romance movie.It is more than romance or tragedy.And Titanic is going to be cinema at 6th of November.I'm excited for watch again.Really,the movie is a perfection.",Titanic

But let's be honest. This movie is the best love/drama/action movie of our era. It shows a lovestory in the middle of a historic disaster. I think we all search for such a love but seldom find it. Di Caprio does a great job, so does everybody else. But the heart of the movie is Kate Winslet. She should have won an Oscar for this role. Now in 2012 I saw Titanic 3D. Amazing! This film wasn't recorded in 3D but you can't tell. And the film still has that magic. If I ever get to be 90, I will still be watching it once every year. And it will still have it's magic. Well done James Cameron!",Titanic
2281,rockandroll432,A Movie I Hate to Love,10,8 April 2012,"I've never been into long movies. When a film starts growing longer than an hour thirty, perhaps an hour forty-five, I can't help but yawn and perhaps snooze off. It happened to me with the greatest movies in the history of cinema: I fell asleep with Gone With the Wind and yawned plenty of times with Schindler's List.But with Titanic, however, hours seemed to dash by without me noticing. I watched the story on screen, with my 3D glasses on, and I was instantly captured by Jack and Rose's story. Three hours twenty, nonetheless. And in all that time, I didn't let out a single yawn. Neither did I look at the time on my phone. I felt how the magic of Titanic really got to me, and when the credits came in my face was flooded with tears.Perhaps what I like the most about this movie is how it has made me feel. Yeah, it has made me feel things I had never felt before. For instance, I had never cried with a movie. And it wasn't just the sad romantic story that involved the two characters - but how all the characters that had interacted with them died one by one, sunk with the Ship of Dreams. Mr. Andrews, Captain Smith, little Cora, Mr. Murdoch, Tommy, Fabrizio...because Titanic isn't just a romantic movie, it's also a historic movie that shows what happened on a fatal April 14 morning, in 1912. One thousand fifty souls sunk down along with the Titanic into the deep waters of the Northern Atlantic, and I could see all that pain and suffering portrayed in James Cameron's movie perfectly. And it was during that dramatic hour, sitting still at the movie theater, in which tears dared to slide down my cheeks, along with most of the other viewers.As the movie credits slid by in the theater screen, my brother asked me if I was crying, and I shook my head. ""It's just the 3D glasses. You know, they get my eyes teary.""Yes, it might have very well been the 3D glasses. Or perhaps the fact that I had watched a great modern classic that will not be easily forgotten.",Titanic
2282,SteveYorkUK,Meaningless drivel,1,29 June 2004,"What a dog! A wonderful exercise by Hollywood in wrapping a tedious love story around an historical event in order to sell tickets. The two stars spend the whole of the film in breathless mode trying to inject some life into this corpse whilst we are ""treated"" to an occasional reference back to the Titanic disaster in order to gain some credibility. No cliché is left unturned in this film, from long lingering shots of the lovers to the wailing drone of the title song endlessly inserted when we are supposed to feel the helplessness of their love. When I saw this film, people actually cheered when the ship went down - we would have cheered more if it went down in the first five minutes. Meaningless fodder for the intellectually challenged.",Titanic
2283,plasticbippy,A ten star movie!,10,12 April 2012,"Titanic is a sad movie and a love story.I liked the move because it's realistic (it's based on a true story). In the beginning of the movie there are some documentaries added, you can hear the real Rose telling us about the accident. There are also very good actors in the movie.The negative with the movie is that they faked with Jack (he didn't exist in real life). They tricked me!It was based on a true story, it was a good love story and it was realistic. The actors were also excellent. It was in some scenes very touching.",Titanic
2284,rk_house,Perfect blending of art and visual sensation,10,12 April 2018,"Poor dialogue, one-dimensional character, predictable plot, Titanic looked weak in its screenplay. Thanks to James Cameron, Titanic deliver the most stunning achievement of blending the art with visual sensation!""You jump I jump"", ""Make each day counts"", ""Jake!""""Rose!"", The cheesy dialogue somehow, were wonderfully delivered by its two leading actor and actress -Leonardo and Kate. They turned the awful dialogue into one of the most iconic line. Their chemistry in the movie is flawless despite the shortcomings of story. The passionate performance by this pair of star, make the entire romantic plot convincing and memorable. Both stars are just perfect for being an iconic couple. The way they brought themselves into the character was so engaging for audience and make us emotionally invested into them and their romance. When Cameron decided to use full scale of model of titanic for sinking sequence, it's already half way to its visual success. The sinking sequence was one of the most thrilling experience in cinematic history. You're not watching the sinking, Cameron takes you there! The fall of funnel, dome implosion, people sliding off the floor, splitting of titanic...all are meticulously crafted and edited in such a way that you are almost think that that is the actual real-time disaster. It's nearly impossible to execute the idea of making the sinking be so real and the sinking carried no notable plot, all they need to do is to make the sequence of terrifying and they did it! The intensity of the sinking, amplifying the epic love of Jake and Rose. The sinking played as an ultimate villain for their romance.The romance of Jack and Rose is magical surreal while the sinking of titanic is realistically represented. Both visual style and tone signifying the tension of plot, and they crafted in complementary style. And last, the death of Jack is the ultimate representation of the lost of 1500 souls on that ship. It was the Loss moment that whatever kind of disaster should ended with - The loss of loved ones. Through the tragic end of Jack, the modern time scene highlight that, it is the moment of melancholy. When the old rose , played by Staurt, emotionally told the story, nothing could go more melancholic. Titanic, proved that the sadness and melancholy are a perfect match of epic. That ending, remind all of us, what we lost in the past, will become a source of melancholy in future.Music and scores was the main driver for emotional feeling. James Horner masterpiece style of scores and song, ""My Heart will Go on"", sang by Celine. The lyrics and scores are so effective to the point that the music help you the understand the implicit detail of their romance and brought into the character inner world. The song has run for 2 decades and more will come. It's so trangenerational appealing.Titanic suffered huge backlash especially among fan boys after its unprecedented success. The backlash is understandable but stupid. For boys, they love to dismiss romance, just like how oscar dismiss superhero genre.
The greatness of Titanic shall be upheld. It;s an classic example of successful and deluxe style of filmmaking. For those who claim the story is weak, kindly read storybook or novel. Titanic is a film in which visual comprised its load of greatness. Titanic provided one of the kind experience that too rare to be seen in theater, and unexpectedly, it was built upon a very weak screenplay/story.",Titanic
2285,lexiknust,Amazing,9,2 May 2012,"This movie, to me, is the saddest movie ever made, but one of the greatest. Although I feel as if the door Rose was on was big enough for two people, I think it showed how much Jack cared for her. My favorite part was when they were dancing downstairs in the ship. Leonardo DiCaprio is one of my favorite actors, and this in this movie, I think he was the best actor. In the scene on the deck, when Rose is about to jump, I think his acting was amazing. My least favorite part in the movie is when Jack is blamed for stealing the kidney of the sea. I have this movie more times than I can count and I cry every time. This will be a movie that will forever be remember for the way it tell the story of the Titanic.",Titanic

The reason the miniature was built was to guide James Cameron while shooting under the water even though some scenes of the miniature was used in the film. Since shooting the real Titanic was done using a submarine, it was hard for James Cameron to move the cameras to get the angles he wanted and it required to move the submarine in ways that it was not capable of doing. So they had to attach movable cameras to the body of the submarine which in turn reduced the total available shooting time because of the pressure on the cameras. So, they had to train everybody who was involved in this shot including the submarine operators using the miniature to utilize the shooting time under the ocean.",Titanic

I hope someday the entire film is released on DVD,every scene that had to be cut for time. A masterpiece that I will never forget as long as I live. Simply the Very Best film ever made,in my mind.On Oscar night when Titanic won 11 awards I felt great,but it should have won 13.Well we don't always get everything we want in life,do we.I know that their were millions of souls on earth that felt the same way I did and still do about this ""Masterpiece"" called ""TITANIC"".

2289,puddingmann,"Titanic is as simple and epic as a myth, extraordinary",10,23 April 2005,"Though the script leaves something to be desired, the use of color and music and cinematography all combine together to provoke wonder and emotion of every kind throughout the film. James Cameron's direction led this movie to become visually astounding, but also emotionally heartfelt through the actors and the music.From the first scenes of the eerie wreck, to the grand, hopeful life of the ship, to its painful, horrifying conclusion, it is obvious that this movie contains nothing but cinematic beauty.As far as the actors go, I personally think that all around the cast did a good job (I thought DiCaprio was the weakest, but Winslet was extraordinary) but the actors had a lot to work against because the script was so tried. The story is a simple love story: unoriginal but still effective and entertaining. IF anything is to blame in the movie, it is not the acting it is the script.The music (and no I am not talking about the Celine Dion song) was one of the best scores in years. It was fitting, and emotionally-in-touch with the film itself. Titanic is about pain, sorrow, hope, love, excitement, beauty, grief, peril, courage, tragedy, romance, and so much more, and it does all of these well. With excellent music, striking visuals, great use of color, epic cinematography, and intimate acting, Titanic is simply brilliant. The reason why it is so hated by some and loved by others today is because Titanic was so popular and successful when it came out that naturally some people hate it just for that, like any popular fad. Titanic will stand the test of time. After all, with a combination of the most Oscar nominations and wins, I don't think anyone can fairly call this movie bad. The movie's music, visuals, use of color, cinematography, and acting is simply incredible. In short: ""It is flawlessly crafted, intelligently constructed, strongly acted and spellbinding. It's quite possible that Titanic is one of the greatest romantic epics ever filmed.""  Entertainment Weekly",Titanic
2290,gregoburton,Possibly Most Overrated Film Ever,6,21 January 2006,"I don't know where all these people get off defending this movie, I think most would agree its not a bad film. It is simply not anywhere near good enough to warrant the hype/accolades it achieved.How this movie set a record for Oscar victories and gross sales, I'll never know. It's a story everyone already knew. They thought the ship was unsinkable, it sunk, a lot of people on board died. I've known this since 4th grade...I think the world has know since 1918.The angle of approach is equally unoriginal and not clever. A story of forbidden love. Wow, I had never heard a story of forbidden love before, because I live in a hole on Saturn.When you take a well known story, and focus on an over done plot line within that story, naturally much of your audience will be bored.

I was 12 then and everybody where crazy about the film. That is my friends at school. We didn't do anything else but played Titanic at during brakes. Of course I didn't appreciate the film as much then as now. I like it because I'm fascinated by Titanic (or well I became that after having seen the film). The accident was so sad. Those who have made the Titanic film really have managed to capture it. How could they make it look so real on film? That's what makes the film so good apart from the story that really appeals to me. Jack and Rose are great characters played very well in my opinion.The conclusion is that Titanic is a film I can see over and over again.

With a amazing cast of wonderful actors, great dialogue, and an unforgettable plot. This movie ties with The Abyss as the greatest James Cameron movie. I mean don't get me wrong Avatar is a great movie with a good plot and unbelievably spectacular special effects and CGI, but unlike Titanic, I can't watch it over and over again like Titanic or The Abyss.This is a movie of epic proportions, and knowing quite a bit about the real Titanic, quite historically accurate. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet have great chemistry and are perfect for their roles. The rest of the cast including Kathy Bates, Billy Zane, Jonathan Hyde and Victor Garber make it almost perfect.

And I could not go anywhere without hearing Celine Dion. *lol* I finally gave in to curiosity and watched Titanic on it's first video release. I fell in love with it. So I mostly just shake my head and chuckle. People still come here to bash this film. It has had loyal fans for the better part of a decade. Out of all the films in IMDb, some of which truly are bad, why not go to those boards? Why do people keep coming here to bash not the film as much as it's' fans? It is very perplexing and a little amusing. Are they hoping to change the minds of loyal fans? Do they also go to the boards of Gone with the Wind? The Wizard of Oz? Star Wars? Harry Potter? Lord of the Rings? Fans of these films also have all Collector's Editions and vast collections of memorabilia. Film makers will create what they think will sell but ultimately, it is we, the fans of film that decide. There are many really wonderful films that are not big money makers. This does not mean that a top grossing film is not good. At the core of this film is the importance of the Historical event. Human ego and arrogance will always be our downfall as a species. When we begin to see ourselves as untouchable and invincible, the result is always tragic. Yes there is a love story painted all over the surface of this film. Cameron even admits that this is as a technique to pull the viewer in. It is the ship that is the star (no pun intended), of this story. He had a burning passion to tell her story. Harry Potter has 3rd graders lined up around the block to read a novel! True fans more proudly announce how many times they have read the books as much as seeing the films. Now while Harry Potter is obviously not based on historical events, J. K. Rowling pulls in elements from classic literature and mythology. Shindler's List is extremely important, both historically and cinematically. It brought renewed attention to historical events that we should never forget. History only repeats if we don't learn the lesson the first time. Whether or not a film personally appeals to me, I respect any cinematic work that gets people reading, talking, thinking about things that they wouldn't normally. Who cares if some fans are wrapped in the love story. Cameron accomplished his goal. People will not forget. Love it or hate it I have yet to meet anyone lukewarm about this film. Love and hate are both passions. This film inspires passion. If someone is going to come here to post about what they didn't like about this film then please do so. Let's hear what you didn't like, let's hear a critique. But just to come here to make eloquent, enlightening and intelligent comments like 'This movie is dumb.', or play name calling at the fans is just bewildering to me.",Titanic

It gives an incredible visual of what it would be like on the titanic and shows comparison between the upper class and lower class and their attitudes and feeling towards their last night on the ""unsinkable ship.""

It was such a mesmerizing film that we are still talking about it after having been shot 16 years ago. It was a very emotional movie and my eyes sometimes filled with tears. I don't know how many times I have watched it but whenever I watch it I am impressed especially with the scene where Jack dies and the scene where Rose throws the necklace into the sea. It merges both the mind and the heart. Also, the music was so perfect that you may even burst into tears just by listening to the music itself. What I loved most about it was the script method and the way of reminding us of the Titanic. We saw old Rose at first, then she began to explain all she knew about the Titanic. That was the time when we got a chance to compare the Titanic which sank to the Titanic which lives in Rose's mind on the screen. Fantastic! To all those who criticize the movie for being nothing more than a love story, I don't know if this love story is true but everybody knows that a lot of people on that ship who loved each other died, didn't they?

2305,becks-17,Many flaws but still magical,10,8 November 2004,"OK, I have a confession:I was one of the fourteen year old girls who sobbed through many a viewing of Titanic,paid to see it at the cinema more than once, bought the video the day it came out and spent many evenings re-watching it. I read books about the film and about the actual history of the ship. In short I became obsessed. Sadly, or rather thankfully, I was not alone. Looking back now at the ripe old age of twenty I cringe at the memory of those days and although having only watched the film once in the last four years (truly) I still regard the film with affection. Of course, now I have distance to actually pick holes in it. Yes, the writing in places is slightly glossy, shall we say. The story is rather predictable and the whole rich girl falls in love with poor cheeky chappy has been done a few times before. The run up to the sinking takes one and a half hours and the sinking takes that time again. Some would say it moves too slowly and for the action loving film-goers out there I certainly take their point. The film does tend to take stereotypes to the max (for instance the treatment of third-class passengers and the snobbery of first-class). This said, I was not alive in 1912 and perhaps this is a completely justified representation of how things were! To me, (though I would never have admitted this six years ago) the iceberg never looked very real-again, having not seen many big icebergs I may be mistaken. However the film has something very rare. It has a certain kind of magic, a soul to it that makes fourteen year old girls sob into their pillows after watching it-I never actually did that...it was just an example.. The love story, although predictable and almost sickening in places has an innocent quality, awakening in the audience memories of their first loves and the naughty glances across rooms and boat decks. True, this is not Leonardo DiCaprio's finest hour (anyone who has seen him in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape?"" will testify) but then the story does not demand an awesome display of acting qualities-just that he be life-loving with a boyish charm (and be able to hang onto the side of a ship for long stretches of time). Kate Winslet plays the sheltered high-society darling to perfection and the rest of the cast slot into place. Of course, the real lead character is the 'Ship of Dreams' herself and the art department certainly came up trumps there, as did the special effects team, turning the cinema/TV screen into a porthole peering into the past-except for the aforementioned iceberg (but then that always posed a problem)-the whole film makes 1912 come alive for a modern-day audience.James Cameron certainly did his research and carefully intertwined established and accepted (to a certain degree) fact with his fiction. His film may have many faults but if you just sit back, let yourself fall in love with the ship, the characters, the romance and grandeur of the age, then the magic may just take you. If not, then just fast forward an hour and a half and see (in my personal opinion) one of the best historical recreations via special effects ever seen on film. So if you haven't watched the film for a while, or hated it when it was surrounded by excessive hype, revisit it. Not with the cynical air of a 'serious' movie-goer but with the innocent, easily-pleased-by-stunning-visual eyes of a fourteen year old and, go on, sob like a baby as Rose lets go of Jack, dropping him into the Atlantic for ever... it's all too much...",Titanic
2306,cyclopics_2009,19 years late to the party,9,7 October 2016,"Even though i have watched this movie couple of times in my childhood, one must give such a masterpiece another try when grown up. Poisoned by the memes and comics shared on Facebook showing how Rose was such a scumbag who could've saved Jack at the end. That's simply not true, trying to be classy here. Any dumb ass with a little common of understanding how Buoyancy force works will tell how it could've not been possible for that piece of debris to take them both regarding weight. It was even showed in the movie, Jack tried to get on the wooden thing but it sunk, not to mention how Rose was such a decent person through out the movie, she freaking blew my mind, firstly choosing real love instead of money and going back for jack in the freaking middle of a catastrophe surrounded by water and then refusing to jump in a rescue boat with women and children and stupidly stayed for him. Oh well closing off this stupid Facebook argument, i have to say that the acting in this movie was stellar. Everything was on point, each character was unique on his own way and of course DiCaprio never cease to impress me especially in this movie. He did it perfectly by portraying a poor likable person with huge confidence and that showed during the scene of the dinner when he sat with bunch of rich highly regarded people and shut them up with his views of how to live your life, a scene that left my jaw opened. Not to mention, i was blown away by the graphics and camera work of the massive ship going down. The only thing that made made give this masterpiece a 9 out of 10 is because how selfish their love story seemed in the middle of such a disaster they only seemed to care for each other. I would've have loved to see them try to help passengers, they were even hesitant to help the little child who was completely alone. Overall i think Cameron did a great job to balance the story line between Jack and Rose love story and the disaster happening but could've been better.",Titanic
2307,dwcl99,I really like it!!!!!,10,4 December 2004,"I consider myself knowledgeable when it comes to the Titanic (the ship, not the movie) so I know a good Titanic story when I see one. Titanic was a very good representation of what actually happened, except for the whole Jack and Rose story, but you get the point. I loved the movie for a few reasons. The first being because of the accuracy. The second being because it revitalized interest in the ship, and the third being that I loved the color shots of the ship, as opposed to actual pictures of the ship which are all in black and white. I have taken a still from the movie, of the ship, and set it as my computer's background because I just love that shot, (it is the shot of the ship shortly after it has left Southampton where the camera moves in on the ship starting from a long distance and then getting progressively closer until it finally hovers over the bridge and you see Captain Smith say ""lets stretch her legs"") I love that shot, and the movie that it was in. I feel that people were beginning to forget about the Titanic and when the movie came around people began to be reminded about it and started to gain an interest in it again. I for one had loved it many years before the movie came out, but felt great when I was talking to people and they actually knew what the Titanic was. This movie is among my favorites.",Titanic

The whole movie taught me a lot. I was very glad i watched it for my first time when i was 11 years old now i am 13 and have watched it 6 times since then. And i never seem to get bored of it it is a one of a kind movie and i can see why it won so many Oscars.

Apparently Titanic is already a very big success around the world and has won 11 Oscars! Quite a lot! I saw the Titanic movie three times already. The actors played brilliantly and Titanic has one of the best pictures I've ever seen. It was very succeeded! Titanic has a very good music, best costumes, best decoration, best story... It is one of the best film I've seen in my life!!! It was very emotional like film and very beautiful, charming and sad at the same time. The end made me cry in my head. It was so well done! I can't believe that Titanic is such a popular movie! The only thing I didn't like was that the film was TOO LONG!!! Actually, I didn't really mind. It is a very dramatic story. The music was so soft and relaxing and make us dream a lot! The music described very well what was happening in the film and the character's feelings!!! Really enjoyable!!! James Cameron is a true genius. I haven't seen Titanic in 3D but I hope that the 3D was excellent. It was a very good story of love! I could recommend it to little and great children to see it! They might love it! The ship was pretty and wonderfully made!!! Pictures are really amazing.

I doesn't even matter if I know what is gonna happen I love it anyways. I love the romance story behind it, it's so romantic. I want a man like Jack who will do anything to make sure I am OK with someone else or with him. If my boyfriend doesn't love this move I would be ready to kick his butt. Every guy can learn from this movie about what a girl really wants even if she says she doesn't want it. Every girl wants a guy they can tell everything to and not have to worry that he will tell anyone. Every girl wants a guy who can be himself in the weirdest situations. Ever girl wants to know that her boyfriend would give up his life for her no matter what happens. I hope every guy will give his future girlfriend or his girlfriend now all the respect she deserves. Cause every girl deserves a guy she can trust like a brother or a best guy friend cause they can have fun times in with all the bad times like I want to have a boyfriend like Jack he died to make sure Rose stayed alive and lived to go on he didn't even really try saving himself from the ice cold water.

This movie is the top of my top ten list of favorite movies, and I know that no other movie would ever replace it. This movie is a love story, and that's one of the things I love about this movie. It shows how love could be found, then lost, but also last forever. It also shows how keeping a promise could make your life worthwhile, and how making each day of your life count, as if that day was your last. This movie shows how strong a love can be, even if one lover had perished. This movie shows, that no matter what happens, or no matter how hopeless, their love will last for an eternity, and it did. This movie has taught me how to make each day count, and that someday, I might find my own Jack Dawson. But most of all, this movie has taught me, that love could happen in a matter of days, and last for an eternity. This movie has always been my favorite, and always will be...I strongly recommend this movie, if you haven't seen it, but then again, it's impossible that no one has seen it, because I'm sure that everyone has at least seen it once...this movie has touched my heart, as well as the hearts of many others...I just hope that this movie has touched yours too.",Titanic

Titanic is a true sensation of love. It is a very nice movie for true lovers. In this movie, the actor sacrificed his life for the safety of his beloved's life. On the other hand, the scenes of the movie, specially sinking of the huge ship Titanic was excellent. Titanic has a great impact on viewers mind. From starting to end, this movie impress us a lot. There were 2235 passengers on this ship and 1522 met their death. Only 713 people could be saved. There is romance, some action, drama and a true love story in this movie.Thanks Dean Scheu",Titanic

I'm not going to add a very long detail of why I do, I just wanted to say that everyone found it hilarious that at the end when Rose says ""I'll never let go, Jack"" Then she lets go of his hand, it's not his hand that she meant. He had made her promise to never let go of the promise to live her life to the fullest and be all she could be, etc. That's what she never let go. And it proves that at the end when you see all of the photos of her life. And the scene at the end when she sees everyone who died in the grand staircase and she kisses Jack is so touching, even if I turn on the movie to only that part it makes me cry. It's the small touches too that make it good. Like the Irish mom telling her kids one last story so that they die quietly is the sweetest thing.",Titanic

Unlike Werner Herzog's Cave of Forgotten Dreams, I do not think that 3D really adds anything to the film. So much so, that I barely noticed it at all, except perhaps for the first few scenes.

2319,WeaponX_64,"Titanic, the greatest film of all time...",10,25 January 2005,"There can be no dispute; James Cameron's 1997 epic, Titanic, is the greatest film ever to meet the silver screen, or any other screen for that matter. Firstly, the film offers a brilliant screenplay which weaves a series of actual events together with pure fiction. Secondly, the cast is perfectly chosen, with Leo and Kate at the front to hold the plot together, to Billy Zane's Cal Hockley (whom we all came to hate), all the way down to Kathy Bates as the ""Unsinkable"" Molly Brown. And third, the tireless work of thousands of people, including the brilliant James Cameron, who wrote, directed, co-produced and co-edited the picture. The film's box-office speaks for itself, with over 1.8 billion dollars earned in under two years. Also, the Oscars tributed the achievement of the film by awarding it 14 nominations and 11 wins, the most nominations and wins ever for a single film. In conclusion, Titanic is a tremendous film. It has the power to bring even the biggest men to tears, and ranks over the top as the greatest film of all time.(And yes, the picture does exceed Gone With The Wind, which won ten Oscars in 1939, as some weird folks like to call it the best).",Titanic

We can see a perfect love story, that has a sad ending, but we can see that the force of love is very strong. Only a woman who is in love can put her life in jeopardy for the man she loves, that in this case was Jack. The tragedy of the Titanic is well performed in this movie, it really caused lot's of deaths and in the movie we can appreciate them. We can say that the power of love is stronger than the tragedy, and we can see a movie with a big quality. We can prove that with such many Oscars this movie won. Also this story contains a little kind of history of the real ""TITANIC"" than sinked a lot of tears ago, and this movie can explain us how was the life in that times, and how did the people suffer in the ship.

2324,k-kemi10,Titanic,10,2 November 2013,"Movie review Titanic is in my opinion an amazing movie. It exposes the true definition of love. Leonardo DiCario fearlessly takes on the leading role as Jack Dawson and in the end sacrifices his life for the woman he falls in love with. Titanic captivates the audience using agape love to connect with the audience and exciting real life situations for the audience to relate to. This movie shows Loves greatest attributes. Those attributes being sacrifice, youth, beauty, humbleness, and endlessness. The beginning of the movie allows the audience to get to know and understand the characters that play significant parts in the movie. Jack and Rose are casted as the leading actors and do a tremendous job in delivering the directors message with their skills. Yet, there are a few other important people that play imperative parts as well. Victor Garber (who plays Thomas Andrew), acts as the captain of the ship. He brilliantly portrays himself to be a dedicated, hardworking man that is emotionally connected to his ship as it sinks to the bottom of the ocean. The director sets the movie up chronologically but reverts to everything as a flashback, which is creative genius. Bernardo Bertolucci is the director of the film and directs this movie in such a way that the world now has a romantic novelty that can be used to show what true love looks like between a man and a woman throughout history, as well as defining true artistic and creative ideas that will forever have an effect of the audience that watches it. Leonardo DiCario and Kate Winslet (who plays rose Dewitt Bukater) have so much chemistry on the screen. The way those two connect is as if they have been passionately in love before in a past life. The climax of the movie is without a doubt the sinking of ship. From the time the ship hits the iceberg, until the time Jack drifts off to sea, action overtakes the movie and real life thrill pops out of the screen. As far as the directing during these scenes, the angles in which the camera records are very effective and essential to the overall perception of the movie. The way the camera zooms in behind and around Rose and Jack as they do the balcony scene, allows the audience to experience that very moment as well and examine how Rose and Jack's bodies reacted to each other the moment he knew he had fallen in love with her. The ending of the movie is where the audience pushes to the edge of their seats and grabs their tissues and the arm of whomever they came with. After seeing Jack sacrifice his life for the one person in the world he found to love more than anything, brings tears to even the men who watch. This is one of the most heartfelt profound films I've ever seen. It's jam packed with emotion, love, experience, knowledge, wisdom, hope, and action. That is the reason this movie is still a phenomenal hit in 2013. The Titanic is truly cinematic genius and is in my opinion one of the top three Romance movies of our time.",Titanic
2325,ykalsh2223,It's a masterpiece. It's the best movie that makes you feel sad for long time,9,2 November 2013,"Titanic is one of the most popular movie. When you watch this movie for the first time, you are probably going to be sad. It's been created in a wonderful way and I'm sure that if James Cameron has the same equipment that helped him to create Avatar, he would have created this movie in an incredible way. The only weak spot is James had not given a space to talk about other people who had died in that disaster. He had concentrated on Rose and Jack. In my opinion, if he did not do that mistake, this movie was going to be better than The Shawshank Redemption which is the best movie. I want to talk about the music. It was really awesome and what made it like this because he chose one of the best composers who is James Horner. Another strong point was its plot. It was organized correctly. the greatest thing in Titanic movie was its end. A protagonist who is Jack had died and he chose that to save his lover.

2326,lgarlock,A spectacular film!,10,15 February 2005,"The visual effects were unlike any I've ever seen. It combined a great story line with a stunning performance by Kate Winslet. Leonardo D. was not at his best. I liked him better in Catch Me If You Can. Billy Zane gave a great impression of seeming truly evil. Bill Paxton was a great archaeologist. I think Titanic deserved the eleven Academy Awards it received. The scene that got me going was when Rose had to get the ax to free Jack from being locked in handcuffs. It seemed so sad that Rose only knew Jack for five days before he died. The costumes made me think I was in 1912. The only downer was the length of the movie.

2327,zingzangspillip,Good movie,7,20 September 2005,"This is an odd film. It takes an historical disaster, the sinking of the Titanic and it adds a saccharine love story on top that supposedly makes the film more accessible. First, let's talk design. James Cameron and his crew have really outdone themselves here. The Oscars and other awards won for these categories were deserved. The promenade set is a sight to behold, and when we finally get to see the ship sink, we see an amalgam of miniatures and computer effects put one of the 20th century's worst disasters indelibly on film. The way Cameron influences our emotions with secondary characters is very well done. We see flashes of families in the third class who know they are going to die soon. Old couples, families with small children. Seeing them is truly heartbreaking, and it is for those people that I mourn when I think of the Titanic. However, instead of letting these images tell the story, Cameron has included a love story on top to make the movie more palatable to audiences. To me, this is the only weakness of the film. The acting is fine (Kathy Bates is brilliant as Unsinkable Molly Brown), but since the main storyline is the weakness of the film, this creates a problem. The fact the relationship was extra-marital didn't help proceedings.Overall, we have a very good movie let down by Hollywood schmaltz. Without the love story, this would have been a masterpiece.",Titanic

Rose becomes selfish, and undresses for a penniless artist, Jack.I really don't see what all the fuss is about.Cal was right to slap her in the face!The movie is completely awful, there really isn't any point to this nonsense.I was hoping that Rose would have jumped off of the ship, that why the audience wouldn't have to endure three hours of her constant whining.This movie is just plain terrible!

Titanic is the worst movie ever made, why might you ask? It has two annoying teenage characters, very overweight Rose, played by chubby Kate Winslet, and skinny teenage brat/""artist"", Jack, played by Leo DiCaprio.You would think that the film would be about the Titanic, right? No, it's about these two brats spending three hours playing games with everyone on the ship, while waiting for it to sink.Not once did I believe that a spoiled and infintile brat like Rose, would win the affections of such a wealthy person like Cal, played by Billy Zane.I mean, I'm one of the few people who actually sees Cal's point of view. I mean Rose did agree to get married to Cal, but instead of accepting it, like a mature person, Rose acts like a spoiled brat, who seriously needs a good spanking from her mother. Rose selfishly accepts the advances of Jack, who has no money, and no way to support himself, other than to cheat other people out of their tickets. I cheered when Cal slapped Rose for cheating on him! If it were me, I would have dumped her long ago, after all, she is not only a brat, but extremely overweight as well!I found this movie to be completely predictable, pretentious and downright BORING! How this film became a hit, shows that teenage girls will see anything with overweight women, as long as a pretty boy like Leo is starring in it.Neither Leo nor Kate can act. And someone seriously needs to recommend that Kate Winslet eat a lot less food, she often looked exhausted after performing a simple task, and her costumes look like they are about to burst.When the boat finally sinks all excitement is worn out after spending three exhausting hours with two immature brats who get on people's nerves!Not to mention after the ship sunk and there are literally hundreds of freezing passengers sinking in the water, Rose, selfishly keeps a large piece of wood for herself, not bothering to offer any space to nearby passengers who all died while Rose selfishly stayed on a large piece of wood.I seriously recommend that fans of this so called movie re-evaluate this flick, but it's downright terrible!

Most people hate this movie now and make fun of it for some odd reason but I don't care. Everything in this film is perfect and flawless. The cinematography, art direction, costume design, visual effects, performances, music, you name it. Once we go back to the time Titanic was to set sail for the first time, magic takes over the film. But of course we cannot deny that the ship is doomed in 4 days and 1500 people are going to die. The sinking of the ship and the death of the passengers is not easy to watch but it is part of what made the film a great epic. The final scene where Rose's spirit goes back to Titanic on the ocean floor and joining Jack and other spirits is powerful and moving. The love between Jack and Rose none of us can ignore and feel. Believe it or not Rose's fiancé, Cal, also did love Rose but not the way Jack did and I could see why rage took over him and tried to kill them with a gun.I would like to thank James Cameron for making this film and the cast of doing such a great job and to the crew.",Titanic
2332,Lewis-Jack-Jeffrey,Review,10,22 February 2014,Fantastic film it deserves all the awards that it received James Cameron at his best writing up such a fantastic film based on the true story of the wreck it shows all of the actors in this film at there finest that made them of what made them where they are today with all of the Oscars eleven of them and forty eight nominations and with the spectacular music from James Honer it is a truly and spectacular film and with a massive amount of money brought through of the box office and titanic being a highly rated film in the late nineteen nighties and came in trough until the early two thousands just after the millennium and being rated seven point seven on IMDb this truly is the best score for this film,Titanic
2333,GoDonkeysGo,great if u like love stories..,9,26 March 2005,"i think that Titanic is a really good movie and Leo & Kate are great actors. the only thing is that it is a love story up until the last hour of the movie..then it's more of a drama. but i personally like love stories,so this obviously was a plus for me, but i can understand the people who don't like love stories might not like this movie as much. Anyway, i love this movie and it makes me sad (if not cry)every time i see it (i think the ""heaven"" part at the end is very sad..where everybody's clapping for them.) but it's not just a love story-the ship sinking has very good special effects. but the main thing i find not believable is that the love story goes a little too far. for example, in real life there wouldn't have been one person handcuffed(jack) and have another person(rose) come and get him. but to me, it made the story more interesting because their love gets me more involved in the story since you start to care more about the characters. Overall, the movie is great, so go see it and girls, grab a box of tissues. i really liked the movie, and that is my opinion.",Titanic
2334,ngonzalezsd,Titanic,10,26 March 2005,"Titanic was an absolutely excellent movie. It was, IS, the greatest movie of all time. Those who laugh upon it know inside that they as well loved that movie and in most cases still do. The entire world loved Titanic, whoever dares to jest at this marvelous film is purely lying to the world and themselves. The acting was excellent, the effects were, for that time, excellent and as well by todays standards ""acceptable"". Titanic will never cease to be ""the greatest films of all time"". It won the most academy awards, it had the best acting, the best effects, the best of everything. It will always be one of the top love stories ever written. It is famous world-wide and we all know so. It is the easiest movie to crack in sherades. If you just make a gesture referring to the Titanic movie, even the little ones will respond with the correct answer. To finalize, Titanic is an excellent movie.

The passion, the LOVE Jack and Rose had for each other, I just wish I could find that. Ever since 5th grade when we were asked to write a paper, story, what ever about the Titanic, you were able to be be a passenger or a reporter on the Titanic. I chose to be a passenger, and kinda of followed the story line of Titanic, the movie. I was a girl, on the ship, and it was the diary of my time on the ship. It was the longest paper I ever wrote, even now, as a freshman in High school. It was about 5 1/2 pages long. both front and back of lined paper. One day, I told my mom I was going to go down and see the Titanic. It seems so unreal, I wanna see it, live, in person. I don't think anyone understands how much that movie means to me, or the Titanic itself. Hopefully someone out there does.

2336,divemaster_2004,What a waist of Oscars,3,12 April 2005,"Warning: this comment contains a spoiler at the end ! I've seen the movie at the theaters, and I have to admit, on a big screen is has some impact on the viewer. But that 's only because of the special effects. The story itself has no added value. How is it possible that this movie was the big winner in 1998 ?! If you compare Titanic with L.A. Confidential it is impossible to understand how Titanic did beat L.A. C. The characters in Titanic are no more than cart board figures, the plot is nowhere surprising, the acting of Leonardo is really acting (and that is not mend positive). And now the spoiler: it is impossible for a human person to stay alive for such a long time in ice water as Leonardo did, but it is also very hard to believe that Kate survived in the Arctic night with all the wet clothing. The people that survived the disaster in reality where the passengers who succeeded in getting into the lifeboats without hitting the water first.",Titanic

Titanic is the film to watch if you want a good cry and a slight scare romance and Billy Zane at his best. Titanic will make you cry and leap for a cushion.",Titanic
2338,pedro-phill,Titanic,10,11 April 2005,I do believe that TITANIC is a FANTASTIC movie and if i do say so 1 of the best the way James Cameron has done all this is absolutely amazing and i give him full marks for an award winning film and sad as it is with the loss of all the people on board that doom stricken ship the way he displayed it was immense and some members of my family were aboard that ship and I absolutely love the film because the romance shows that not even a ship that was doomed could break there relationship and it proves the real fact true love never dies. The graphics don't look fake and basically everything looks realistic and so life like. I have recommended a lot of films in my time and i may only be 13 but I would have loved to see this movie in the cinemas. 10/10,Titanic

2340,julieneven,It's a great movie,9,26 March 2014,"Titanic is a true story about the disaster of the Titanic who sunk in 1912, directed by James Cameron. The movie starts with a guy who is looking for a treasure, a diamond neck less, which would be hidden in the Titanic. When he goes searching, he finds a safe, but only with money and a drawing of a woman, Rose, who's wearing the diamond neck less. She sees this on TV and contacts the man. Then she starts telling her story : Rose took the boat to the U.S with her family and fiancé Caledon. Rose isn't happy and wants to kill herself but Jack is the one who saves her. That's the moment that Rose and Jack meet for the first time. Rose's family forbids her to have contact with Jack, but Rose refuses and falls in love with Jack.They said Titanic was the best romantic movie of all times and I can't deny it. The movie has broken all the records in 1997 and won 11 Oscars! It's a really spectacular movie, one you must see at least ones. It's a story that everyone likes, you have romantic parts but also parts who are very exciting with a little bit action like the fight between Jack and Caledon. One of the pluses of the movie is the cast: Leonardo Dicaprio, Kate Winslet,... They are one by one great actors and actresses. The movie is based on a true story, most of the movie is historical correct and that's what I also like about the movie. You learn something about how it would have been and the actors represent it very well. At the end I really didn't doubt that Rose and Jack were truly in love. James Cameron made a movie with really great shots and special effects. In the beginning you see amazing shots on the bottom of the ocean from the real Titanic as well as the break up of the ship and the interior shots in the giant flooded tanks. Those shots make this movie so great. You can see where they putted so much money in. Titanic is a masterpiece that tells the almost impossible love story of Rose and Jack, but also one of the worst disasters of all time. It's understandable why so many people watch it several times. I would definitely recommend it to other people.",Titanic

2343,ana_anita_18,A love story that lies beneath the sea,10,25 May 2014,"titanic , a film based on a true story , where the main plot is the love affair between Jack Dawson and Rose DeWitt Bukater . The typical case of two young people who fall in love but are of different social classes and are fighting for their love. Jack won some tickets to travel on the Titanic and it is there where he meets Rose and will live the best experience of their lives , until the morning of April 1912 that the ship sinks when hit an iceberg. This tragedy became one of the largest wrecks in history occurred in peacetime where many people , among them Jack who struggled to look after Rose, died. This story shows us not only love at first sight, but do not always have money you have everything , high society people lost their lives in "" Titanic "" who was one of the best ships of the time. Certainly the history of titanic shows us true love , but unfortunately did not last forever . The story ends when Rose after many years has it happened that night .

2345,Agamem_non,A modern classic romance,8,15 June 2005,"The best selling film at the world wide box office has a really bad rating on this website. Agreed this film is not to everyones taste but neither is Casablanca. The main fault of Titanic and why it is rated lower than Casablanca is that more people have seen titanic. Thus, with its split opinion, the film is destined to appear on top 100 shows on TV but will suffer when it comes to ratings of this kind. the performances are excellent and every dollar of Cameron's'budget is up there on screen.And for once there is an engaging storyline to accompany the sinking ship. The most notable performance is Billy Zane's performance as we all grit our teeth watching him as the snob villain of the piece. The event that everyone waits for does not disappoint but the main reason why Titanic deserves its place on the top 250 is because the storyline that accompanies it is brilliant. there's my two cents",Titanic

It is one of the most successful movies ever made, as well as one of the most beloved. The plot describes how two young people, Rose and Jack, meet each other abroad the Atlantic ocean and fall in love. The way that this movie portrays the tragedy is so beautiful and eye catching. It is filmed with such color that the audience is just drawn to it right away. The acting is another strong point of the film. It gives the audience almost an out-of-body experience as it takes you through the plot. It is as if we are living the events on the screen: in a sense they are happening to us. The title ""Titanic"" automatically gives off a tragic tone. Everybody knows what happened on the ship. However, the many different shifts in tone make this film that much more enjoyable. It connects to the audience's emotions in such a way that they see all the different perspectives of the movie.",Titanic

2349,alysbrangwin,an epic disaster that's not for everyone,8,30 May 2005,"Titanic has a lot of fans and a lot of detractors. The movie itself is a technical masterpiece. James Cameron showed things that people had never seen before, such as going down into the actual wreckage with this little machine. The movie came out when I was 12, and since I was one of the millions of girls who were head over heels in love with Leonardo DiCaprio, I went to see it four times in the theater.As I said, technically this movie is just brilliant. Some of the technology is a little bit outdated: if you look closely enough, you can pick out the computer images, but I don't think those detract from the visuals. The sets and costumes are absolutely marvelous. The music is also beautiful and haunting, and it's just right for the film's mood. I've always thought that the love theme ""My Heart Will Go On"" is cheesy, but effective in conveying the message of the film.Of course the movie is about the Titanic, but that is really the backdrop for the love-across-class-lines story between Rose DeWitt Bukater and Jack Dawson. When I was 12 of course, this was absolutely fantastic. Now I see it a bit differently, but I do find it appealing nonetheless. The idea is a little bit ludicrous considering how the ship was built and isolated the upper class from those in steerage. A woman being able to break away from that is also pretty doubtful, but nonetheless if you can get over that you can see the love story for what it is, and that its message is love transcends all obstacles. This is a great movie to watch on a Saturday afternoon when it's rainy outside and you've got nothing better to do.Aside from the love story you have the entire tragic loss of life from the sinking of the ship. I think this was both well-done by Cameron visually and the viewer sees the absurdity of course in Rose's jumping off the lifeboat to return to Jack. Again though we understand as an audience that we're going to be experiencing the foundering of this ship through the eyes of our two star-cross'd lovers, so the audience just has to roll with the punches here. Some of the shots here are amazing, and it gets a little ghastly when the ship breaks in half and people start falling off and hitting propellers and getting landed on by the stern of the ship.The dialogue in this movie, however, is far from stellar. The worst parts are the modern day pieces with Gloria Stewart and Bill Paxton's acting is as flat as the Great Plains. Again you just have to roll with the punches to get to the good stuff, which is all the material when they're on the Titanic. Billy Zane makes a great villain, and so does Frances Fisher as the mother. Kate Winslet I think did an excellent job given some of her lines are a bit dull, but I think she still pulls it off convincingly. Leonardo DiCaprio is also a good actor, and although some of his lines are terrible, you can see in him the youth and vibrancy that a poor young artist must have when he's gotten the chance of a lifetime.It's interesting to look at the roles of these women too, as Rose is not portrayed as a damsel in distress, but more of a young woman who's confused and angry and trapped in her upper class world. While it may sound like a poor little rich girl story, Kate Winslet convinces you that it's not just about her resenting her position in society. If you were Rose, you'd be unhappy too.Overall I still love this movie. It's a great disaster film and has a lot of those classic elements. The direction and the sets and costumes are visually dazzling, and some of the acting is not superb, but overall I still say it's a good movie. It's definitely worth watching once, if only for the sets and the sinking of the ship.",Titanic
2350,ironeagle128,Biggest Waste of 100+ million dollars ever!!!!!,1,29 May 2005,"This movie is the biggest waste of an opportunity of all time. It could have been a great movie about one of the greatest tragedies in history. They didn't even focus on the ship at all. It was like two and a half of hours of some crappy romance movie and then at the end the director was like ""oh yeah and the titanic is sinking"". Could have been a great historical/disaster flick. The only reason it is the highest selling movie of all time is cuz prepubescent girls saw it 100 times because ""Leo is so hot"". Instead they chose to focus only on two people in a ridiculously cheesy and cliché-ish love story between a poor boy and a rich girl. Could have been one of the best movies ever...is one of the worst. Extremeley disappointed. Don't watch it or you will be too!!",Titanic

2353,AlexH214,"A heart-wrenching, timeless film",10,4 June 2005,"A beautiful, heart-wrenching tale of love, hope, and tragedy, ""Titanic"" is a timeless movie that will move you, inspire you, and bring you to tears. This movie has all the elements needed for an epic film: characters that get us involved in the story, a wonderfully dramatic score, fantastic technological achievements, and a real-life tragedy that tugs at our heartstrings.Some people feel that the love story between Rose and Jack detracts from the real story of ""Titanic"". I, however, think that it greatly adds to it. By following these two characters and their brief, yet passionate, love affair, we get more involved in the story, so when the ship finally sinks, it is all the more heartbreaking when we see so many people meet their tragic end. And the love story isn't the only reason we feel so moved; when the ship is sinking, the various scenes of the doomed third class passengers break your heart as well. Among other things, as the ship sinks we see a mother singing her children to sleep, an elderly couple lying together in bed, and people desperately trying to get in the boats or jumping off the ends of the ship; all these scenes made me cry. I actually found myself in tears through almost the entire second half of the movie. Though the real sinking is terrible in itself, this film emotionally moves us because we actually know people on the ship, making this movie succeed where other films about ""Titanic"" have failed.Not only is the plot moving, but the technological achievements in this film are ahead of its time. James Cameron was able to realistically recreate the sinking of ""Titanic"", and it is absolutely astonishing. He is able to add amazing detail that had me utterly transfixed throughout the entire movie. James Horner's score for the film is also spectacular. It is haunting and wonderfully dramatic, and completely suits the film.I never saw ""Titanic"" while it was in theaters, as I was under 13 and my parents had this rule about not seeing PG-13 movies until I was 13. In fact, I didn't see ""Titanic"" until a couple days ago, when it was on TV, and even then I only saw the last half of the movie. But that half had me so transfixed that I drove over to Target right away to buy the DVD, because I just HAD to see the entire thing. And I am very glad I did. ""Titanic"" truly is a timeless movie, because even though it came out 8 years ago, I absolutely fell in love with it. It is now one of my favorite movies ever.""Titanic"" is the kind of movie that people either love or hate, and to give the haters some credit, this movie does have its faults. The acting is shaky at parts and some scenes and lines are a bit cheesy. All movies have their shortcomings and ""Titanic"" is no exception. But in the end, none of that matters. The good points far outweigh the bad, making ""Titanic"" one of the greatest films of all time.",Titanic

It has all the elements of a great movie: romance, tragedy, lost love, disaster... its great! The characters are wonderful, and the script is beautiful. The new special edition DVD has a ton of extras, including some never-before-seen deleted scenes. In my opinion, its a good thing those scenes were left on the cutting room floor, though. As far as scenery, you couldn't ask for a more beautiful film visually. Even though most of it is digital, it really has the feel of being on the Titanic with Rose and Jack. The costumes alone are enough to take your breath away. The love between Jack and Rose is unparalleled, and I couldn't ask for a better film to have a good cry to.

Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio act with such passion that it makes the whole movie wonderful. It definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Picture. The detail is amazing; the furniture, utensils, etc. is absolutely extraordinary. I definitely recommend Titanic. The soundtrack matches the movie so good and the feeling and passion in the movie makes it feel like you were there. The suspense comes in at all the right places and really contributes to the overall movie. It's amazing how the Titanic was recreated to look like the actual ship, it really does. The historical footage at the beginning of the movie and near the end really shows how bad the sinking was and how terrible it would have been to have to leave your loved ones on the sinking ship as you stepped into a life boat.

The story of a dream sinking on her maiden voyage, killing 1500 people, and affecting the lives of several thousands. This catastrophy would shake a whole world. James Cameron made Titanic remembered on a whole new level. James Cameron reached for the stars. And he got 'em.This movie changed the movie industry (IMHO) for ever. The amount of ressources and time spend on reproducing this vessel, is astonishing. And even 20 years after, I have no complaints to the special effects (or the plot for that matter). The plot is somehow a bit of a cliché. Jack, a handsome third class passenger, falling in love with the stunning first class passenger Rose. And their struggle together to leave the doomed ship. Normally i would never go for a love movie, as Titanic. But James Cameron built it really well, especially because of the ending.The music composed for this movie has become legendary, and builds the emotions that define the whole impression of the movie. James Horner did a remarkable job to achieve this. I have in my 22 years, never seen a movie like Titanic. I have watched it +20 times, and I will watch many times again.

Finding Jack on the ship changed Rose's life; she did all of the things that Jack and her had talked about doing, which she probably would not have done if she hadn't of met him. This movie shows that those that you have loved do live on inside of you forever, and Rose lived on for both herself and Jack. Doing for both of them what they had only talked about doing. Titanic is truly one of the greatest films, I believe. A piece of cinema that should be cherished.",Titanic
2361,hkrishnan633,"Flawed,but still it's a masterpiece",8,3 January 2015,"Titanic may be a spoiled little drama. But it's the most astounding, wonderful romantic movie I've ever known.1st half is a bit boring. And you may feel this movie is crappy at times. Also, the love story between the lead couple isn't mentioned fully.But, from the I'm flying scene, the story gains momentum. The 2nd half is spectacular and by the end, it leaves the viewers crying. The most emotional movie ever, Titanic gives you an experience which no other romantic tragedy could. It is the most magical, poetic and picturesque piece of romantic movie work. Hats off to you Cameron, for creating an unforgettable drama of emotions, trust, love, ambitiousness, endurance, survival and of all, grief when lose the one you loved. I love you Titanic. I'll never let go of you Titanic. Never let go.",Titanic
2362,scumbagsteve927,some sappy love story,10,26 June 2006,"Well after watching this movie a few times a think this movie is one of the worst movies i've seen. Here is why some many people made it controversial it was a huge and horrible event so people said ""Hey! this movie has it all Naked people Fabritzios dying gaint ships sinking and last but not least the two words JACK and ROSE. I accually counted how many times those word were said, it was 143. For GOD SAKES James Cameron! You used those words more than the vowel I. But in the end this movie was AWFUL. 4 million dollars on nothing. I mean lets look at Night of the Living Dead. That was the best movie I have ever seen. That was a 6k movie. James could of donated the money to the poor. Instead of making the shitty movie.",Titanic
2363,esther-ruth,A remarkable achievement.,8,9 July 2005,"The sheer scale of 'Titanic' is enough to make your jaw drop. From the time it starts its maiden voyage to its devastating final hours.The acting is good and I think that overall the cast have done an admirable job of showing the attitudes of the different classes and have brought sensitivity to their roles at appropriate times. Kate Winslet (Rose) particularly excels - her accent never seems to falter and she makes herself believable to the audience as a sort of rebellious first class passenger. Gloria Stewart, as the older Rose, is also excellent.Another thing that I liked about 'Titanic' was the music. James Horner's score is both beautiful and dramatic and really wraps up the film. And, yes, My Heart Will Go On is pretty good too...Although some more historic detail might have made the film that little bit better, or perhaps even a note at the end giving a little more information about the actual catastrophe, I think James Cameron has done a commendable job of bringing the tragic disaster to the screen. In addition to this, it's a fine love story with likable and abhorrent characters, great cinematography and a bit of tension and suspense too. Plus Leonardo DiCaprio. An impressive film to watch.",Titanic
2364,cand_born,THE BEST MOVIE EVER!!!!! Why? I'll tell you why!,10,15 June 2005,"This is the best movie ever made in the whole movie industry. Why would I recommend anyone to watch it? 'Cause in one word - you'll stay breathless. This movie is incredible, I've loved it in every way - the scenes, the script, the picture, the clothes, the music - it's all so magical. I really enjoyed watching 'Titanic'. The actors are amazing - handsome Leo and beautiful Kate (which is by the way one of my favorite actresses) did fine job and I couldn't picture anyone else to act instead of them. There is some kind of power, some kind of joy which can be seen in every second of this movie and that is what makes it so great. Love between Rose and Jack is so amazingly expressed in that free, innocent way of their talking and just looking at each other. And I don't want you think that I'm one of those types who are pure romantic souls and instantly watch soaps. I'm in fact opposite of them, maybe not entirely, but I am. That's why I don't think Rose should be criticized for letting Jack go into the water. That is the thing that makes the strength of this movie, the freedom of expressing cruel reality of today's world. It can't everything go well and as the way we want it. I really loved the fact that movie did not end '..and they lived happily ever after..' And it would be stupid if it ended like that. This movie shows that you can at least once in a lifetime experience pure, true and free love that can lead you to the most secret places in your mind and 'you can be saved by that person in every possible way that one person can be saved', just as Rose has said. With these I words I leave you think about what I said and I recommend you to watch this movie 'cause those three are hours you'll never forget, just like I never will.",Titanic
2365,meowhafizova,Very good film,10,9 March 2015,"A review of Titanic by Eli.SwI recently watched Titanic.It is an epic romantic disaster film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet.The film director is James Cameron.The core of the film is an epic romance. Cameron said that this was the ""great love story"". While the love story appears to be the heart of the film it is, however, the anachronistic characters of Jack and Rose that make the film so appealing to today's audiences. The story is very gripping,exciting and romantic.It is about members of different social classes who fall in love aboard the ship during its ill- fated maiden voyage. Unfortunately,the film has a sad ending.I think the acting is very good.DiCaprio is excellent,as usual.The special effects and music were wonderful.I really enjoyed this film.I was crying in the end,it was very exciting.Go to watch it if you can.❤",Titanic

I enjoyed it tremendously and I can see it as many times as I want. I also love the acting of Kate and Leo. The music in the movie really touches your heart and to tell the truth, I believe the people who say this movie is terrible are uncomfortable because there is romance, when romance is the best part of any story! Anyone's life sooner or later will be touched with love and you can't deny that. TITANIC is only an example of how powerful love can truly be!

2369,oxmiaxo,I first went to see this movie when i was eight years.....,10,29 August 2005,"I first went to see this movie when i was eight years old. Because i was young i did not get the concept of the movie, therefore i did not fall in love with the characters as i did when i got older. The characters are Jack Dawson(Leonardo DiCaprio), a poor man who won two tickets on Titanic by having a luckily hand in poker. His friend Fabrizio, an Italian man, accompanies him. During the trip Jack saves a woman named Rose(Kate Winslet), who was attempting suicide. As a reward Rose's fiancé, Cal, invites Jack to dinner along with them and the first class. During the next day, Rose gets to know this man who saved her, and she finds to love him, and not her fiancé. Towards the ending, when the ship is sinking, Rose must choose between her rich fiancé Cal, or the man she loves, Jack. Although this may seem as a sappy love story, it is still really about the ""unsinkable"" ship Tianic. Titanic, the ship and its passengers has been one of the most intriguing things that I've ever studied. as the ship is sinking they only let women and children on to the lifeboats first, but then they do not let out the people 3rd class, and you see a woman telling her children a bedtime story, because she knows that there is just no hope of surviving. This movie will make your eyes water, if the least. Its a long, but very good movie. i have seen it about 6 or 7 times and i still cry every time. James Cameron has done a great job on this movie. without the music, and the actors, this movie wouldn't of been the same.",Titanic

The acting was sub-par at best. It made a lot of money because teenage girls went to see the movie 7 times in the theaters because of Leonardo. Where the hell did they get the money? Anyway, I wanted to learn more about the Titanic; why it sank, what was running through a lot of people's minds; maybe even a little conspiracy stuff. Does anyone realize that certain people didn't even board the ship because there was a fire on board before it even took off? No, you don't because all you see is a rich girl falling for a poor boy and he paints her naked (did that corny junk at least tip you off that the movie was stupid?).I did cry in during one scene, though. The scene when they showed the water that was filling up in the ship. It looked like pool water! I'm thinking this movie made all this money and they couldn't even make the water from the ocean look real? unbelievable...Ohhh the band played on while the ship sank.. Just ridiculous. This was the worst movie until Pearl Harbor outdid it in the ""Nothing to Do With Reality"" department.",Titanic

It was sort of the breakout movie for Leonardo and Kate, and i feel they did a great job along with all the other actors and actress's. May i also mention the incredible score by James Horner is amazing. And what i don't understand is why some people love to hate this movie, the people who walked into this movie and already decided they were going to analyze every flaw should have never even saw it in the first place, because there really just ruining it for everybody else. i give this move a 10 out a 10 and i think most people would agree that it definitely deserved to win the Oscar that year for best picture, its an unforgettable movie that everyone should see",Titanic

My friends and i were talking about the most romantic scenes in cinema history.Titanic deserved it. yes am talking about the scene rose(Kate Winslet) walking down the stairway and is kissed on the hand by jack(Leonardo DiCaprio). Yes that topped are list of the most romantic scene ever. And another very beautiful scene is when they are standing on the railing, right on the edge of the titanic,the ship of dreams, spread their hands. Whoa breath taking.Anyway coming to the movie its just amazing. It was so touching. Awesome movie both about the fictional love story and the true story put together a great combination. It adds an emotional side when the captain realizing that there is no way they can evacuate all these people locks himself up. And the man who built the ship, designed it also stays back. emotions get very high and stress levels are increasing the crowd going wild the crew unable to control them. And one of the crew members kills two people who were desperate to get on to life boat. then the crew member salutes his fellow crew and kills himself. This movie shows the discrimination between the rich and the poor during those times. There is this one part where 3rd class people are trying to get out but are locked and this little girl asks her mom why they aren't being allowed to go and the mother replies saying that the first class people go and then they will be allowed to go and the little girl smiles at her mom. A very touching movie.

There are good performances, just not by the leads. Kate Winslett is wooden, which is supposed to represent uptight. Dialogue is anachronistic for the period suited for 1997 and not 1912. With the lavish budget and long production time Titanic could have been an excellent study of class, society and prejudice. All of that is lost in favor of presenting a teenage love story.

A wealthy woman trapped in her own life is a difficult role to play. The romance was a great way to catch people's attention.

2379,guardbaby,Review of Viewing of The Titanic,8,12 October 2015,"The Heart in a SeaIn the epic adventure that the movie, Titanic, takes you on, the characters ""Jack' and ""Rose"" develop not only as people separately but also as a couple. The historic event of the sinking of the titanic is depicted beautifully in the cinematography of the animated versions of the great, expansive ship and actual scenes of underwater footage and also the CGI, Computer Generated Imagery. As the story unravels, more and more of the characters are revealed. The great expansion of the voyage was built to be one of great proportion, being the fastest and strongest ship of its time. Leaving dock on a Wednesday afternoon, the tenth of April 1912. At promptly noon. A couple thousand passengers boarded the Titanic, expecting to be a part of history, only to meet their demise in an untimely collusion with an iceberg that could have been avoided. Believably, the Titanic stands on its own in the heart catching drama that twists and turns in ways that have you on your seat until the very end. ""Jack""- Leonardo DiCaprio, is the heart throb that have girls and women alike swooning at the blink of his eye. Having being able to board the ship, he greets ""Rose""- Kate Winslett, and develops an infatuation with the first class beauty, that he sees to have no chance with. Developing a story line in the first few minutes, the great expanse of the ship is a mighty sight to behold. From the hull of the ship to the back rudders under the water. Winning the Oscar for best cinematography was a just winning. From the scenes of the ship sailing to the final sinking of the ship. The sets that had to be created demonstrated the craftsmanship and theatrics. In the beginning, I viewed the movie as just another love story that could easily be dismissed. After watching closely and scrutinizing the details and multiple works that went into the movie I was astonished. Not only did James Cameron do amazingly with the actors he chose, but also every other aspect of developing the historic details of the event. The event itself was traumatic, while adding some of the personal stories to back it up gave the realism to how it affected the people that were aboard the ship. Obviously, some of the stories were make believe but, it pulled at the heart strings just enough to keep the audience from turning away from the underlying message. Personally, the scene that I was most impressed with would be the scene of the ship breaking completely in half and the events that followed. Backing up, the scene where the ship collides with the iceberg, a fact. The hit took approximately 37 seconds, the scene in the film was about that long as well. Filming this scene took editing genius and complete madness in commitment to the actor's roles.",Titanic
2380,airwin-35946,"This movie will make you laugh, cry, and learn all in one!",10,31 August 2015,"Even though some of the actual events did not occur in reality as portrayed in the film, I feel as if the film portrayed the events to the best of their ability. I thought that the film did a good job of displaying the hardships and diversity between social classes. The character's interactions and emotions about the situations and conflicts they were faced with were also depicted well. Leonardo DiCaprio (one of my favorite actors) and Kate Winslet play amazing roles as Jack and Rose, and they do it justice! The connection and relationship between the two is a story in itself within the film as well as the ship's tragedy.As a young girl I watched this movie many many times with my grandmother. After watching it so much I became obsessed with learning about the Titanic. To this day I still enjoy doing research about the actual ship, the people aboard, the engineers who built the ship, the accident, the aftermath, and what is still being found in the bottom of the Atlantic.

However I found the setting for the love story rather disturbing.The focus on the love story seemed to trivialise the death of hundreds of passengers. I know that certain characters died, but at the end of the day it was a tragic version of the Romeo and Juliet-esquire forbidden love that almost made light of a tragedy.On a side note, I found it laughable for all those people who didn't want to know the ending.

2382,katelynmichellex,Titanic,10,12 October 2015,"Titanic (1997) Titanic, released in 1997, is a timeless film starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The film is set in the ocean traveling from Europe to America, on a grand ""unsinkable"" cruise ship. In the beginning of this movie, the quote was said ""not even God himself could sink this ship"", which is foreshadowing the events we know not just in the movie, but also in real life. This quote was said to have been spoken in real life, 1912, when the ship actually sank. It was a fantastic move on the director's part, not only to foreshadow the ship sinking in the movie, but to retain the historical accuracy of the story, at least as it is believed. The directors and producers of this movie started off showing real footage of the sunken ship, mixed with some CGI footage, however, you can't tell the difference. Upon coming across a safe hidden inside the ship, they removed it and brought it to the surface, hoping to find money or treasure. However, the only thing they find undamaged is a painting, of whom they don't know. Soon, they DO find the woman in the painting. Her name is Rose (Gloria Stuart). Rose comes to the researchers and they show her computer footage of how the ship sank, scientifically. Rose then tells them ""That's quite interesting, however, the experience was quite different."" She then goes into detail of the story of the titanic, bringing it back to life, and telling her experiences on board by her younger self (Kate Winslet) and the love of her life she meets a little later, Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio). Throughout the movie, the directors switch between the story of young Rose and Jack on the ship, to old Rose telling the story.During the story that old Rose is telling, you see it played out on the screen, mostly in CGI. The difference between what is real and CGI is almost undetectable. The entire ship itself, along with the 300+ people on the deck, are all CGI. I think the directors and crew working with the CGI did such a wonderful job, and I personally didn't know the difference between what was CGI and real film until watching a short documentary on the subject. The script writing for this film was amazing. The movie draws you in and shows you what it would have been like aboard the titanic in both first and third class. When Rose meets Jack, you can feel the connection they have together and it's heartbreaking when her mother says she doesn't want them to be together. The film uses a lot of emotional appeals to make you feel for the characters, especially when the ship sinks. You fall so in love with these characters that I find it almost impossible not to cry. Overall, Titanic was an amazing movie and I recommend everyone watch it at some point.",Titanic

2384,thomascat3,Entertainment value,10,13 July 2005,"Someone recently posted that some people seem to hate popular movies simply because they're popular... rather than looking at what makes them popular, they begin to look at ways to bring down the movie in areas that to most movie-watchers do not matter.When I watch a movie, I generally watch it to be entertained. I understand creative license, so I (thus) do not generally care if the historical details are all correct in a movie built around a historical moment (such as Titanic is). I don't think about whether or not the dialogue is ""wooden"" or if the plot is thick enough... if I am entertained, I give the movie a thumbs-up.I was entertained immensely by Titanic. Titanic had all the ingredients of a great film: action, adventure, suspense, comedy, romance, intrigue.Most people love a love story, and this was one. It was not really about the ship at all, but about the love of Jack and Rose. As a love story, it was wonderful.I cried several times and left the theater thinking I'd seen a great movie. My feelings were justified by the 11 Oscars and all the money it made... its popularity.IMDb should get on board.And who the hell gave it a 1? WATCH the movie before you spread hate, please. If you want a documentary, you'll be disappointed. If you want to be entertained, you'll very likely not be disappointed.This movie is rated 7+ by nearly everyone, but there are a few (apparently) disgruntled viewers who either did not get the point of the movie (more about the forbidden romance between Jack and Rose -- and the tension it creates among Jack, Rose, Cal, Rose's mom -- than it is about the actual sinking) or are hating just to go against the status quo.",Titanic

There will probably never be a movie that matches the creativity and wittiness of the Titanic. If you didn't enjoy this movie then you must've been in a bad mood while you watched it for fell asleep halfway through, if you paid attention then you will no doubt love the movie.The movie is an epic action packed romance with a few comical scenes tossed in here and there. The beginning and the end of the movie was beautiful, minus the massive tragedy that ended in painful deaths for most of the passengers. One of the main characters, Rose, was slowly converted from the rich snobby lifestyle to the poor, having fun lifestyle. The shots and special effects of that which was in the Titanic were unmatched be the movie that has ever been seen at the time, the camera angles are the excellent and the sound in the background is excellent.The Titanic won several Oscars, all of them well deserved. The most prestigious award was the academy award for best picture. It also won an academy award for best director, a Kid's choice award for favorite movie, and an Academy award for best cinematography. The line ""Jack, I'll never let go."" Was brilliant and ended up being one of the most famous lines in movie history, for good reason.

2386,priya_patel-89866,Titanic,10,12 October 2015,"Titanic Review James Cameron's Titanic is a crazy love drama that brings people to love the movie more and more and it sucks you in it, and it is a crazy emotional roller coaster for any of the people that haven't seen it for the first and they are seeing it now you will be crying your hearts out. It is about two teenagers that fall in love in a boat on its way to New York, which brings the light out the boys and girls eyes and it help. Titanic is about a ship that is 'unsinkable' of the historical matter and the love stories from Rose (Kate Winslet) point of view of the movie throughout the whole movie. Rose is 17 years old and she feels in love with a boy that boards the boat Jake (Leonardo DiCaprio). Titanic won 11 Oscars for the filming and cinematography of the movie. We meet Rose's character when she firsts gets on the ship to the SS Titanic she is a rich and classy she is in the 1st class of the ship she has a lot of money and she is engaged to Cal her fiancé and they are going to be getting married. Jake (Leonardo DiCaprio) first time we see him is when he is playing poker and he wins and he gets send to the SS Titanic to go on a trip with friend Fabrizio (Danny Nucci). The boat was about to leave but they made it to SS Titanic before it left the dock. How Jake and Rose is the most sweet cute amazing gesture I love it so much. The character of Rose and Jake played by (Leonardo and Kate Winslet). The cinematography of the movie is amazing and how they use the flashback scenes and how they switch with Old Rose telling the story back to the teenage rose. The developing of Jake and Rose in the movie and how Kate and Leonardo play the character and how to make it more developed and how the ship is the place that Jake and Rose fell in love for the first time and they are a young couple. It received a lot of money it received over $200 Million dollars. Jake and Rose loving and relationships in the movie shows a lot of how much the love in the movie develops and how it puts everyone in good, the cinematography in the movie is amazing some of my favorite cinematography scene is when the boat is about to sink and the color and the music changes and how the color changes though the movie and how they change up the color and sound of the movie. The cinematography of when Jack and Rose are hanging on the side and are on the railing of the boat and the color changes because of how the sunset and how they show the relationship with the time and the scene of the movie. The cinematography is amazing and that it is why they won a Oscar for best cinematography. Titanic won Best Picture,Best Director(James Cameron), Best Costume Design,Best Sound, Best Film Editing,Best Effects, Sound effects editing, Best Effects Visual Effects,Best Music Original Song, and Best Music dramatic score Leonardo and Kate were nominated for Best Actor and Actress but they never won and Leonardo has never won a Oscar and he deserve to win a Oscar. Titanic is amazing wonderful and it is a emotional roller coaster and it will put you through a lot, i watched it the first time and i love it and it is amazing movie it is going to be a amazing roller coaster. Titanic is a amazing movie and it is a roller coaster you might love it as much as me.Titanic is a great movie such a great romantic drama movie.",Titanic
2387,atuell,Titanic Review,10,12 October 2015,"Titanic is an emotional, heart wrenching roller coaster type of film. One minute you will be laughing at how cute Leonardo DiCaprio is and the next minute you will be crying as you watch the ship sink into the deep ocean. The film's sole purpose was to one, show the history of the ""unsinkable"" ship, but on the other hand it takes a closer look at the passengers on the ship. There were two different types of people on the Titanic, the upper class, which was filled with the wealthy and well off people, and then there was the lower class, full of poor and not so well off people. As the movie progresses you see who belongs to where and how the classes get along with each other. As it introduces the characters, we the audience all fall in love with Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio) so does Rose (Kate Winslet). Rose is a young, gorgeous, wealthy girl traveling back to America to marry her horrible fiancé, Cal (Billy Zane), and Jack is a cute, intelligent, but poor boy who snuck onto the ship. In this interesting romance between Rose and Jack there's also a panic rising deep within Cal as he begins to realize there just might be something going on between Jack and Rose. Rose and Cal are part of the upper class and their costumes and dialogue really show their class well. By this i mean that Rose and Cal wear nice and neat clothes and expensive jewelry and they speak all proper and tight and clean. On the other hand you have Jack, he's part of the lower class and dresses kind of sloppy and in rags it looks like and his slang is in no comparison to the proper way of speech the class above him uses. Still though, Jack and Rose can see past each others flaws and riches and manage to fall in love almost instantly. But putting the romance and drama aside, there's something even more interesting about to happen, a mysterious iceberg. As we all know the ship Titanic is indeed, sinkable. As the ship is sinking, that's when things become real and suspenseful and emotional and scary. You're on the edge of your seating biting your nails literally praying for the inevitable. On another note, James Cameron did an amazing job recreating a completely believable Titanic. I honestly thought it was real i had no idea he recreated it on a computer. The sinking scenes were just as horrific on screen as they were the night it was a reality to so many people. I was so transfixed onto the screen i couldn't believe it. The cinematic for this movie were incredibly believable and just utterly beautiful. I do not think anyone else could have done a better job at recreating such a horrific night but still make it into a love story at the same time. The music was yet another memorable aspect of this film. It was warming and heart touching during the love scene. It then turned into a calm serene as the violinists play while the ship is sinking. When Jack and Rose are ""flying"" at the bow of the ship, the music that is playing was used for the mood and for the effect of the emotions being displayed on Rose's face as Jack touches her to help her ""fly"". The music is used to perceive the mood and emotions being displayed during a particular scene. Whether it was calm to frantic, or warm love back to sad with sorrow, the music was used in a most incredible way and it really made the scenes pop and stand out to me. Lastly, in my opinion you don't just watch this type of movie, you really feel everything the characters are feeling. When they were crying or screaming, then you were too. When Jack and Rose are falling madly in love, I was too. James Cameron set this amazing atmosphere for his audience that just reels us in and we can't be pulled out. Over all i can say that i love this movie. The historical details were on point, the story-line was just utterly beautiful but heart wrenching as well, the cinematography was used amazingly, and the music and characters were portrayed nicely. This film as both thumbs up from me!",Titanic
2388,rapso-45199,A romantic movie about 2 lovers who's society rank don't match however their heart do,8,31 October 2015,"WHAT A WONDERFUL MOVIE! I've been talked for years and years that I had to see that movie, that it was great, one of the best movies ever etc. but without really knowing why it didn't inspired me at first. Luckily a friend of mine forced me to watch it with her and I'm so grateful for that! I enjoyed every single moment of the film and I can't wait to see it again! It's well-played, the main character is handsome, the storyline is brilliant and moreover I found the actor's cues really funny. The only little thing I 'regret' would be the fact that it's really long but actually I was so 'catched' by the story that it didn't seem that long. A would certainly recommend it! You absolutely can't miss it!!!",Titanic
2389,flsr,Titanic is my favourite movie.,10,3 November 2015,"Titanic(1997) is my favourite movie.I had watched this move 10 years ago,and I had also watched the movie Titanic 3D (2012)on 2013. Titanic enriches us with a romantic story of young love, passion and feelings, full of utopias and dreams, mother and child fighting for power and greed, idealistic and self-identified clashes within a consenting human ambitions society and victims of their own vanity and pomposity. This is one of the films that most shocked the general public in the last twenty years. The huge collections that are logical because they got obvious that Titanic has one of those stories full of strength and feeling, with great dramatic content. If we add the stunning beauty of the image, thanks to advances in digital technology, success is understandable. Very successful movie, which tells the story of the sinking of the ship, but in the background shows a passionate love story. It achieves a harmonious balance in that, in the mix of history and feelings, and makes it almost perfect.",Titanic
2390,iptorres,hello,10,7 November 2016,"Have to say, this is the best movie of all times. If you are a future filmmaker you should see this movie and the making of witch I think is powerful. Leonardo DiCaprio's performance was incredible. Kate Winslet was phenomenal, these two actor had a big responsibility. They proof themselves they were ready for this challenge. James Cameron, his vision since day 1 was incredible. He took a big risk in Hollywood, some people in the industry doubt about the success of the film. But he believe in himself, the project and vision he had for it. Till today Titanic is the best movie in history. Hard work paid off, Great job James Cameron.",Titanic

2395,caila-rotger,Tender Love Story With a Dramatic Historical Background,10,26 January 2006,"When someone mentions 90s blockbuster movies, one of the first things said is always Titanic.The 1997 movie, staring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet, broke box-office records both in the USA and internationally, still holding the record as the highest box-office grossing movie internationally by $482,400,000, leading over Lord of the Rings: Return of the King. It won 11 Academy Awards, tying it with Ben-Hur for the most one by any single movie. It was nominated for 14 Oscars. It had another 76 wins and 47 nominations.The acting was great; not wonderful; but still very good in every sense of the word. Not only by Kate and Leonardo, but many people on the cast that were overshadowed by the stars. Gloria Stuart gives a heart-breaking performance in her return to the screen. Victor Garber portrayed Thomas Andrews, and did a magnificent job, his best scene being the meeting between Ismay, EJ Smith, and himself; Andrews declaring Titanic will founder. The main story in itself is one that has been told a million times over. A poor boy and a rich girl meet by chance and soon fall in love, but her parents will not allow it because of social order. Titanic has one thing going for it as it tells this story, the backdrop of history and tragedy tied into one as the lovers meet on the ill-fated ship Titanic. We are introduced to Rose De-Witt Bukater, a young woman of society who is engaged to Caledon Hockley, the son of a rich steel tycoon. We find ourselves on Rose's side as she rebels against her mother and Cal, ultimately resulting in a suicide attempt. Fate steps in there, bringing her a savior by the name of Jack Dawson, an artist who wins third class tickets aboard Titanic in a poker match. He persuades Rose not to jump off the back of the ship; telling her that if she jumps, he'll have to go after her.The story is being narrated by Rose Calvert, a woman of 100, who upon seeing a drawing on television decides to contact Brock Lovett, a salvager who is exploring the Titanic. He is the one who found the drawing, and kept it only because he noticed that the woman in the picture is wearing a diamond necklace. Rose and her granddaughter Lizzy are brought upon Brock's ship, where she tells the crew she is the woman in the picture. Brock then tells them the diamond is said to have gone down with the ship, and would be worth more than the Hope Diamond if discovered. Rose says nothing, but starts into her account of what happened during her experience with Titanic.Jack and Rose continue to grow to love after he saves her from death. Rose tries to deny her feelings for him, but can't help herself, despite threats made by both her fiancée and mother. She longs to be like Jack, free and independent; something she has never done before. She tries her hardest to do this, by having Jack draw her nude, wearing only the blue diamond necklace her fiancée Cal bought for her. This is the drawing Brock finds 84 years later. But fate has a twisted hand of cards, making Cal frame Jack into stealing the diamond, and having him being locked away. Rose chooses to believe Cal, but not for long. She soon comes back for him, saving him from being drowned.They continue their race for survival, staying on the ship until the bitter end, despite a gun chase by Cal and his manservant Lovejoy, and Rose choosing to jump off the lifeboat and back onto Titanic for she can't leave Jack behind. It is at this point Rose realizes that she does love Jack, greeting him with the words, ""You jump, I jump, right?"" Subsequently they continue trying to stay alive as the glorious ship is destroyed. The band is shown playing their final song, ""Nearer My God To Thee,"" making for a emotional montage.Finally, as the ship goes under, Jack ushers Rose to a broken door. It can only hold one of them, and he offers it to her. They listen to the screams until it gets quiet, and Jack realizes that he will die soon. His final words tell Rose to keep on living, not to let herself die. He makes her promise never to give up, and not to let go of that promise. She agrees, saying that she'll never let go. A light appears out of the darkness, and Rose, barely clinging to life, tries to awaken Jack to tell him there's a boat coming back, but there's no use. As she is shocked by his death, she remembers her promise to keep on living, so leaves him there in the ocean, saying once more she'll never let go. Old Rose then speaks of how the 700 saved people floating in lifeboats were waiting, to die, to live, and for an absolution that would never come. It then shows her walking on the deck of Brock's research ship, standing on the railing, to show that she had the diamond Brock had spent three years searching for. Another flashback is here, showing young Rose feeling the pocket of the jacket Cal put on her, feeling in the pocket and pulling out the diamond. Old Rose then looks at the deep blue diamond one more time, then tosses it into the ocean.There are many ways to interpret the ending of the movie. In my opinion, she passes away. Old Rose is seen going to sleep, then cutting to a dream sequence where Young Rose and Jack are reunited on Titanic and then a cut to a bright light. On the DVD, the name of that scene is called A Promise Kept.",Titanic
2396,georgewakely,A Beautiful Story,10,25 November 2015,"The tragic story of a maritime disaster coated with a true love story. The story line of love breaking the social class barriers really is beautiful. Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet are beautifully paired in this heartfelt film about breaking free and living your life the way that you want and not the way your social class tell you to. Kate Winslet's portrayal of the class restricted Rose, who is fed up with her stiff upper lip family and the restrictions of being a first class woman. Being forced into an unhappy marriage to the over bearing and big-headed millionaire Cal she even considers suicide. Whilst sailing to America on the R.M.S. Titanic, Rose meets Jack Dawson, a third class passenger. During the journey they have a whirlwind affair of passion. But the Distaster strikes as the ship hits an ice berg and sinks. The couple escape through flooded corridors and rooms, pursued by a torrent of icy sea water. They escape the ship, but they don't both survive the night in the frozen Atlantic sea.",Titanic
2397,j_n_d_89,Good,9,22 July 2005,"Good film overall... The plot is good too, however there are mistakes within the film itself (e.g 1/: the fact that When Rose is arriving in New York half asleep, she looks at the Statue of Liberty, which is the colour green. But if you visit the statue of liberty, you'll find a plate telling you that the original colour was brown, and it took over 35 years for it to change colour. The statue of liberty was placed there in 1886, so in 1912 it should have still been partly brown.. e.g 2/: In the engine room as the ship is sinking, the smoke and steam coming from the machinery rises at the same angle as the ship, about 45 degrees. So, the shot was filmed level, then tilted afterwards).",Titanic

The amount of work that went into making this film has heavily impacted the final product and that final product is amazing and a must watch. Additional scenes are also well done, the whole thing is well scripted and written to be as accurate as possible. The detail in the interiors of all rooms on the Titanic are fascinating and sitting watching this leaves you with your jaw dropped.

Lost track of how many times I've seen it, but it's enough to have memorized the entire 3 hours and 14 minutes (seriously!!). This is definitely a must see, over and over again. It never gets boring. Granted, 3 hours and 14 minutes seems long, but it goes by so quickly. The movie is over so quickly. I really want them to re-release it next December in the movie theater for the 10 year anniversary. If you haven't seen it, definitely head to out and buy it immediately. Any DVD collection is not complete without it (or a few copies like me in case one of them breaks or wears out from too much usage!!!).",Titanic
2400,nkanalley-60984,A powerful piece of American folk art,9,26 December 2015,"James Cameron's Titanic is obviously the work of someone obsessed with his subject, and it shows. Everything, from the wallpaper in the 1st Class Suites to the bunks in 3rd Class, from the bow where Jack and Rose have their first meeting to the wireless room where Harold Bride and Jack Phillips desperately sent their (ultimately futile) SOS signals for emergency assistance, is, as it were, ""as it was."" Cameron even ensures that the audience is never in doubt as to the horrific fate of the 1500 people left aboard Titanic when the lifeboats left; there was no absence of life jackets, and most of the people left behind froze to death in the icy waters off the Grand Banks of Newfoundland. For most Americans born after the discovery of the Titanic's wreck by Robert Ballard in 1986, this film was their introduction to the fascinating, tragic story of the ""unsinkable"" ship of dreams. All of this, of course, would mean nothing if the film was a dud. And truthfully, the script ain't Shakespeare. Kate Winslet's Rose is made to remark that "" it appears there are not enough life boats for everyone aboard"" while on a tour of the ship early in the film. Hint, hint. Poor Billy Zane isn't given much to work with in Cal, Rose's one note fiancée. Her choice between ego-maniacal capitalist and sensitive, artistic proletarian isn't much of a choice at all. And good old Leo looks, more than 15 years on, like he's strutting onto the ship from 90s middle America, not 1912. But I'm quibbling. No, Jack and Rose would never have been able to meet in real life. No, Jack would never in a million years have been allowed to attend a dinner in 1st Class. No, no 1st class girls got to attend quaint Irish dance parties in 3rd Class (was this in keeping with the ""Riverdance"" phenomenon of the time, James?). And the heart-rending last moments between our star crossed lovers on the floating door would have been quite impossible (hypothermia would have set in within five minutes, and their bodies would have been twitching like crazy from the shock of the below-freezing water, thus preventing any kind of coherent conversation at all). But in the end, none of that matters much. At it's heart, Titanic is a piece of classic American folk art. It's not meant for the highbrow crowd; there aren't long lingering shots open to multiple interpretations. Jack's observation that Monet's ""use of color"" is ""great"" is, to be sure, wince inducing. But at it's heart, Titanic works because it reflects our own deepest, personal wishes; our most cherished and deeply held dreams. The dream to break out of our personal circumstances and live our lives as we wish to live them (to quote Jack early in the film). And of course, to love and be loved so deeply, that even if we only know the person for seventy two hours and are separated from them for 84 years, we remember them and our time with them as if it were yesterday.To know what it is to finally meet the one person who you would happily, even gratefully, give up your own life to save. This is the kind of love all humans dream of, but seldom find. The best art reflects and interprets dreams common to humankind; by telling this story in this particular way, James Cameron has succeeded spectacularly in creating a visual tone poem to human yearning. Even if the first half of the film seems like a trite soap opera, the emotional impact of the final moments alone puts everything you've seen in the first three hours into sharp perspective. One wonders how many people in that freezing water more than a hundred years ago now felt as Jack did in those final moments. We'll never know, but Cameron has given them a fine memorial in this imperfect masterpiece of populist cinema.",Titanic
2401,valene-01952,Review of Titanic,10,18 January 2016,"The film ""Titanic"" is produced by James Cameron. It is starred by Leonardo DiCaprio, Kate Winslet and Billy Zane. The story is about a love story which takes place on the Titanic. This boat goes to America. The film begins with Rose and Jack who fall in love although there are from very different social classes. Rose is with her fiancé and her family who are very rich and Jack is very poor. What is surprised me it's the end because it's a very beautiful and sad story at the same time. I like this film because of the story and the main characters. This film is very interesting there is a love story and moreover there is the story of the Titanic which is a tragedy. Moreover, the B.O is very well.",Titanic
2402,zbp-99930,Such a good movie,10,19 March 2016,"(WARNING: may contain some SPOILERS)I'm a child and I absolutely love this movie. At my school I am criticized for loving Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in this love story. In the past year we lost an amazing man and terrific film composer. I had been a fan of his since 2009, the first time I had seen this movie. James Horner was an amazing man who could make your heart ache from the very first note played to HIS final coda. The love between Leo and Kate's characters is heart breaking and tragic. I had been an avid lover of titanic and decided that I should watch the movie and I instantly fell in love with the whole story. I may not be in love with the movie now as I was then but I still enjoy watching it even though it gets harder each time in the months that passed since James Horners death in June 2015.I know people criticize Céline for the song but in my honest opinion I think the collaboration between her Horner and Will Jennings was the best collaboration ever. The song, which has been one of my favorites for a long time, really hit the tragic love story on the mark. The idea that two people can meet in the oddest of circumstances and make love happen is really extraordinary.Jim Cameron really hit the mark with this movie. Sure, there may be some historical inaccuracies, but you shouldn't hate on the man for being fascinated with something that the world has been fascinated with since her sinking in 1912. Many movies had been made on the ship and hit more of the actual historical accuracies but this one really takes the cake.",Titanic

I have the DVD (3 disc) (I didn't even know there was a four disc one!), but was looking for books on the site. This amazes me, because that is proof that it is one of the best movies they have made. I don't think i saw it until last summer @ my friends house. Then we both went to visit someone who said we were gonna watch it every day.At first I was like, Oh i don't want to, but after we watched it there, it was like I needed to watch it. during X-mas break i watched it 11 times out of 14 days. Now I watch it every Sunday because it sank on a Sunday.It is one of the best movies you will ever see.

Then later own jack says ""this was the best thing that happened to me winning the tickets to be on titanic, it led me to you"" (something like that) Cameron did a great job combining the two and making it feel like we were the third wheel or something lol Leo and Kate were amazing. They both did great. Of course Kate did better; it had more to do with her Life and how she wanted to escape but didn't know how to. I cry every single time I watch this movie. It's so upsetting.

It's got sexual tension, action, social commentary, and the acting doesn't suck. It's even got Bill Paxton, one of my top 10 criteria for a great movie. What's so horrible about it that it deserves an aggregate 6.9?

2419,MannyGirl168,Great Movie,10,10 September 2005,This movie was one of the best movies i have ever seen. Its a tale of love and tragedy. This movie is amazing. I love the story line. Jack and Rose belong together. I love the ending with the part about the heart of the ocean. And people who have seen this know what I'm talking about. Jack has such a good outlook on life its great. The Titanic was a awful mistake. Many people died and seeing what happened on the ship was amazing. I definitely recommend the movie. It has a great story line and lots of action. This movie game a whole new perspective look on life. This movie is the best movie i have seen in a long long time. Titanic is a wonderful movie that makes you fall in love with the characters,Titanic
2420,neopets_lover4444,The BEST Movie ever,10,10 September 2005,"I LOVE the Titanic. It's simply the best movie EVER. I'm a TOTAL Titanic buff, and I just love the way James Cameron portrays the Titanic. I always cry whenever I see it, even though I've seen it probably hundreds of times before. Its a magnificent movie and it was #1 in the box office for 3 months straight. If you haven't seen it, you're missing out on A LOT. A bit of Titanic trivia: In the movie, when Jack draws Rose, the hands are those of James Cameron, the director and drawer of the picture. When Jack mentions ice fishing to Rose, it can't be possible... the reason why is because he mentions a man-made lake in Wisconsin that wasn't built until 1918, after the Titanic sank.",Titanic
2421,majszakconrad,The infamous rose and jack on the door,10,21 March 2019,When people started complaining about jack dying and calling them names is ridiculous. Even when mythbusters did it they seem to try to be as accurate as possible but what they missed is by jack staying off it that is why kept rose as dry as possible when the busters did stuff to get position just right and even tied the life best on the door I can tell you that it would have been more then extremely difficult to do that in north Atlantic freezing water your ha d do not work well and if they had to take there time in life suits if jack kept forcing rose in the water to safe himself he would have killed her as well the busters did a test that if jack was able to get out of the water immediately he would have barely survived just barely! Meaning if he even made her fall in o e or two times she would not have survived let alone probably 7 or more times the busters fell in and the door would have been sitting a few inches I. The water at that temp it would have more then enough to kill her. So I believe the way it happe. Was well thought out and orchestrated. And last thing if he would have survived the movie would not have been as good. It's the story of after titanic that makes the movie stick with you if he survived it would have made it a good movie not an amazing top 5 movie of all time.,Titanic

Maybe you think that I was only a boy then.To tell you the truth that 8 years later,I still think it an excellent film although somebody think it not.Maybe this love story looks not relative to our real life,but it won't conceal that the music,special effect and picture are outstanding even much better than the ones now.I have seen the film only once despite many people's several times and I still love it as one of my best favorite movies.",Titanic

2425,theriaasucks,"Flawless, brilliant film.",10,4 February 2006,"Titanic is one of the very most well made movies I have ever seen. You can debate about it's greatness, but it surely is not bad.I saw Titanic on VHS right when it came out, I was about seven or eight. I didn't really pay attention, but I liked the sinking part. So it was right after Christmas last year, and I was flipping through channels and saw that this movie just started on HBO. Hearing a lot about this film and having nothing better to do at the time, I thought I'd watch it. Not remembering it at all, and watching about thirty minutes in, I didn't really expect the ship to sink. I never thought about it, that is pretty awesome because the people on the ship didn't expect it. This movie does a very good job of drawing you into the main characters. You know Jack and Rose are going to end up together, but at the same time it also gives you a feeling that it's not going to happen. Watching the movie, you know they want each other. It finally happens, and you really start to get into the movie. Like I said before, you don't really wait for the ship to hit the iceburg, you don't think about it. Then, it finally happens that one night. The makers of the movie did a very good job on focusing on other characters meeting their fate while still concentrating on Jack and Rose. The sinking part is amazing. It does an unbelievable job of showing you how horrific and huge it really was. It also did a great job of showing you the event wasn't over once the ship went under the surface. The very end scene, when Jack and Rose meet in heaven, is brilliant.This movie is incredibly well made, and for certain not bad as many close minded people think.Watch the movie with an open mind, and you will not be disappointed. Many people watch the movie with a closed mind expecting it to be ""gay"", and find excuses while watching it. This movie is very, very well made, flawless, and excellent. One of the very best modern films.",Titanic
2426,gul_hameed,The only Movie that brought tears :'),10,8 November 2018,"Ok let's be honest. I'm 17, and this movie is about 21 years Old. I've seen Hundreds of Hollywood Movies including Fictional, Romantic, Tragedies, Drama and Action. But this Movie is included in all the above Categories. And in all of that it has been ""The Number 1 Top grossing Blockbuster movie"" for over 12 years. The Director Mr. James Cameron has done brilliant Job in working on such a great Project. The Movie seems to look alive even after 21 years. The Effects used in the Movie are Outstanding even for the present day.
Actually, the reason why I wanted to give a review about this movie was that I loved the Fictional part of this Movie i.e. Jake and Rose. Cameron Has done a great Work in writting such a Wonderful And Fascinating Love story ever written. I've seen alot of Dramatic scene but, this Movie actually brought tears in My eyes. This Fictional Part of the Movie looks so real and Every scene that Includes Jake and Rose in it just trembles my Heart. The Theme song of this Movie ""My heart will go on"" just refreshes the soul and Gradually brings tears as we go on to listen it reminding about Jake and Rose. The Best scene was When Rose Survives and Reaches America, She looks at the Statute of Liberty city missing Jake. And a few moments later an officer asks Her name and she answers: ""Rose Dawson"" naming after Jake.
I think I'm gonna need a physiatrist hehehe because I've been Watching this movie 6 times consecutively. I just love this Movie so much. Leo and Kate are my Favourite Hollywood celebrities of All time. This Movie is never dying Master piece. Love You Jake and Rose <3.

2427,RichieStyles,They say time will tell - In this case it most definitely has.,8,20 July 2007,"When this was released in 1997 with Cameron's infamous speech proclaiming himself 'king of the world' most of the movie going population agreed. At the time this was the biggest movie in the world: biggest budget, biggest male lead, biggest ship ever, and using the biggest special effects. But once we see past all that and look at the content of the film itself, we see a lot of poor acting and extremely poor dialogue, and a film that is based in reality, yet focuses on 2 fictional characters with zero chemistry. Billy Zane was the real star of this film, if there is one, with his line ""I hope you're very HAPPPY together"". But since 1997 the movie going public has grown up, and are not so fooled by all the hype anymore. We have arrived at our own conclusions.I think that Titanic is an overlong flatulence filled, cliché' driven, sickly, vomit inducing, self absorbed, egotistical, pompous pile of hot air. A ridiculously over the top, zealous, ego orientated, steaming pile of substance-less horse manure, which in 1997 fooled nearly the entire population into thinking it was this great masterpiece! No other film in the history of cinema built itself up so much before sinking so deep (ha ha get it?). That is why Titanic is the worst film ever inflicted on an unsuspecting public!",Titanic

2430,hpgirl98,A cinematic masterpiece!!,10,15 December 2006,"Let me start off by saying that I have been accused of being over obsessed with Titanic. I will admit, I am fascinated by the tragedy of this ship. This has got to be one of the biggest tragedies in world history. I have always enjoyed researching this topic and finding out everything I can about exactly what happened that fateful night.Now to get on to my movie review. This movie captured the tragedy of what happened April 14-15 1912. James Cameron is a fabulous director. He captured the fear of what the passengers must have been going through on that fateful night.Now onto Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. They both did such a fantastic job in portraying their characters. I was blown away. The on-screen chemistry between the two of them was absolutely fantastic. The two roles without a doubt launched the two of them into the fantastic careers they both have. Any movie I have seen either one of them in including Titanic, have shown their skills phenomenally. I recently saw The Beach, the movie Leo did after Titanic and although the movie was a flop, Leo did a fantastic job as always. I have seen Kate in Finding Neverland and that is without a doubt one of my favorite movies of all time. She portrayed her character so well. That film nearly brought me to tears.Overall, this movie is a fantastic movie. It is a cinematic masterpiece that will go down in history as the biggest grossing film of all time.The best part of this movie was without a doubt when Jack was in the ocean and Rose was on the door and she tells him she loves him. That is the best part. It's situations like that, that really show you who a person really is.This movie can relate to real life so much. Even without thinking about the historical context of the movie. Everyone goes through love and at some point in life people feel the tragedy of losing someone. It doesn't matter who it is, that one someone will strike in the way losing Jack affected Rose.",Titanic

2432,brittneychandler,Review,10,5 March 2017,"Review Title: Titanic Media: Film/Movie Genre: Action, Disaster, Drama, Romance Description: Titanic is a movie about a love story taken place on a ship that was known for being un-sinkable. Two main characters are Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet. The two played two different classes of people that weren't supposed to fall in love, but did. On the voyage, the ship and everyone on it came across a huge iceberg. They tried to miss it but the size was larger than what was expected. The ship split down the middle, throwing everyone off causing more than 1,500 people to drown and freeze to death. Backstory: Now 101 years old, Rose Dewitt Bukater (played by Kate Winslet) told her granddaughter and the Keldysh crew about her life in 1912 April 10th. When Rose was younger she abroad Titanic with her upper-class mother and fiancé. Also, at the time, Jack Dawson (played by Leonardo DiCaprio) played a game with his friends for a third-class ticket on the ship. The two were not meant to be together, not even meant to come across each other. The two days on the Titanic before the horrible incident occurred, Rose and Jack spent most of the time there with each other. He drew her like one of his ""French girls"" wearing only the rarest diamond, the Heart of the Ocean. The romance kept getting deeper, but her fiancé had a different plan for them. Out of jealousy, her fiancé, Cal, locks Jack into a room, handcuffed and not able to get out. While Jack is in the room, where no one can hear him yell to get him out, the ship collides with the iceberg. Rose goes and looks for Jack and the ship is beginning to take on water. Finally, Rose gets Jack out and they go to the top to get on a rescue boat to stay alive. As the ship lowers, Jack and Rose are fighting death of the freezing water. Unfortunately, Jack did not make it alive but Rose did. After 84 years, Rose began to tell her heroic, tragic, but love story while being on the ""unsinkable"" ship, Titanic. Judgment: Titanic is one of the best movies that was made. It was well informative on what took place in 1912. It showed the history, the disaster, and the love that was taken place on the historical ship. It has a full story of events that occurred and it was well acted and directed. Reasons/Evidence: Rose Bukater told her story. There was actual footage of the sunken ship. The producers and crew told the whole story and not a short section of it. The movie had a budget of $200 million dollars, which showed everything that happened from start to end. Relevant Comparisons: Avatar, The Notebook, Forrest Gump Criteria: 1. Is the story real? 2. Is the acting good? 3. Did it look fake? 4. Does it have a good story? 5. Was all the history correct?",Titanic

The genius of the movie comes not from the tragic sinking of the liner but the romance that develops between Jack and Rose.Don't be put off by the 3 hr plus running time, this film canters along at breathtaking pace, with the final hour of the film containing some superb special effects.Costing upwards of 200 million dollars to make, Titanic was all set to become one of the greatest flops of all time.

2436,nbarone-2,"If you like sap, then you'll eat this movie up",1,1 July 2006,"On a scale of 1 to bread, I give it -3. This movie money'd it's way into our lives, selling us a tragic historical event, without giving us an interesting plot, good acting, or a good script. I think the only saving grace was the directing. They take a sappy love story, package it around the sinking of the Titanic and make millions. The idea is not creative at all. Under that premise, I can make a movie called Civil War and have it be about a girl from the Union and a guy from the Confederacy who fall in love. Then at the end, there's this whole war thing and the guy dies. I'd make millions!!! Heck, that movie has probably already been created. Sub-par, unoriginal stories like this pollute the movie industry with the same ignorant recycled message: that love conquers all... even death. We get it. If you find yourself at the movie store with your girl or gal and you want to rent a good, romantic movie, you'd be better off renting American Psycho.

It won 11 Academy Awards and has been described as ""The Greatest Film Ever"" How can people say that something like this is rubbish?! This is my favourite film. For me when I watch this I feel like I'm going on a journey on the ship seeing what our two main characters are going through. How people don't cry at the end of this when their journey ends in tragedy is beyond me! The atmosphere, the acting is so emotional! ""Come Back Jack, Come Back"" those famous lines mixed with tears and violins starting to play for me is the saddest moment I've ever witnessed on a television screen. Other emotional moments such as children being read a bedtime story, an old couple hugging together as the water fills up around them, a woman clutching her child trying to survive play on the heart strings of the viewer. What kind of heartless person can show no emotion to this?! One of the most famous moments in film is the ""I'm Flying"" scene. This has been done again and again and we know it from Titanic. This film is one of the most successful films of all time so I really don't know how people can criticise one bit of it. The acting, directing, writing & music is perfect. This film is absolutely amazing.",Titanic
2439,SaxyClarinet,Simply Amazing.,10,7 August 2006,"As a 13 year old girl, I saw this movie for the first time all the way through in January of this year on HBO. Ever since, I have been obsessed. You may think you will hate this movie if you haven't seen it, I know exactly where you are coming from. Before I started to watch it, I thought the exact same thing, and 3 hours later, I was in tears. This movie can get even some of the toughest people to cry. There are many sad parts that have made me cry at least once including the Nearer My God To Thee scene, Old Rose talking about Jack, Jack dying, and many more. But there is one scene that never fails to make me cry, the Heaven scene where all the characters in the movie are reunited at the end of the movie on the Grand Staircase and Jack and Rose meet at the top in, ""Heaven"" This movie has great acting, lines, shots, and an awesome storyline. This movie is about a 3rd class male, Jack Dawson, who won his ticket on Titanic at a lucky hand of poker. On the Titanic, he meets a 1st class young woman by the name of Rose DeWitt Bukater, by attempted suicide and he saves her. She is already engaged, but her mother is forcing her to marry Caledon Hockley, just for the fortune. Rose and Jack fall madly in a forbidden love, and fate pulls them apart when Titanic sinks. 10 Stars!",Titanic
2440,dancin_jennie,Absolutely Fantastic on DVD,10,25 October 2005,"I first watched the movie when i was younger. It didn't have as much of an effect on me then, probably because i was too young to understand, but even then i thought the fictional love story about Jack and Rose was amazing. I cried at the end of the film then (when the ship sank and Jack and Rose were in the water).But to top the first production, the film has just been released on DVD. I watched this film with my in-laws the other night and i thought it was absolutely breath taking. The special effects have had a 're-vamp' so the ship looks even more spectacular. The only down side to the DVD is that it is on 2 discs (but not to worry, give's time for a toilet break as the film is over 3 hours long). The first disc lasted for 90minutes and the second disc was around the same duration. And i swear, as soon as that timer hit 30mins on the second disc, i cried all the way until the end. An absolutely fantastic film..And to top it all, there is an extra 45mins of deleted scenes included on the disc. I would recommend these deleted scenes as they contain a lot of the factual information that was cut out from the original film (the captain calling back the life-boats, family sending Morse-code messages to their loved ones).I would highly recommend watching this film on DVD. It will take your breath away. Just have the tissues at the ready.",Titanic
2441,janetxling,a one of a kind epic,10,25 October 2005,"I can not quite understand why this movie is rated only a 7.0, it is worthy of so much more! I did not know what to expect from the movie, ""Titanic,"" when it first came out for viewing; other than it being said to be ""terrific"", ""superb"", and ""heart-moving"" from classmates and friends. When I finally saw the movie in the theaters, I was left speechless! That was the best movie I have seen. The ""Titanic"" is more of a fairytale, a movie that keeps you at the edge of your seats until the end of the movie. It was a movie that displays the social classes, the untroubled life of the low classes and the superficial life of the rich ones. A part of the movie was a love story between two young people, the rich and misunderstood girl played by Kate Winslet and the poor young man played by Leonardo DiCaprio. When destiny brought them together on the voyage of the Titanic, they faced many troubling events in order to pursue their prohibited love. Another factor that everyone should absolutely go see this ""Titanic"" is because of the platinum and Oscar winning soundtrack. It was simply wonderful, it sounded like an angel singing and it really helped when it was played during the sad moments in the movie. Celine Dion did an excellent job in singing ""My Heart Will Go On"", and James Horner did the terrific job producing the song. James Cameron, the director, did an unbelievable job in transporting the audience back to 1912; the misfortune of the sinking ship, Titanic. And the special effects for this movie? Wow, it was jaw-dropping. The computer-generated ship was flawless  I didn't even know it was computer generated until I watched the ""background scenes"" for this movie ""Titanic"".The performances of Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet were absolutely breathtaking. It almost felt as if the audience were apart of their love, their love felt so real. It is no wonder that they were nominated for Academy Award.",Titanic
2442,mrzouggagh,I nejoyed it as a big fan of history and adventures,9,7 February 2019,"I have watched so many films of the director James Cameron and I liked them all. Titanic is one of his great works that tells the story Titanic accident occurred in 1912. James Cameron used special effects to make the scenes of sinking look like real.
The film is about a poor boy named Jack who met a rich girl with the name of Rose. Rose was trying to commit suicide to escape her forced marriage. Jack convinced Rose not to do so and there start their love story. While crossing the ocean, the ship hit an iceberg and sunk into the water.
I enjoyed the appealing acting of Leonardo Dicaprio (Jack) and Kate Winslet (rose) who performed well as the leading actors.
Every second of the 194 minutes of the film amused me even if the end of the movie is sad because Jack died after he has saved Rose's life. If you love history, drama, and romance Titanic I a must to watch.",Titanic

I remember how I once saw on TV a man with his son,both with tears in their eyes , and how the spectators were standing on their feet and applauding minutes in a row after this movie came to an end. I am wondering why the most marks given to this movie are marks of 8,9 10 and 1 ? An average is an average, but usually the marks are insignificantly higher or lower than the average itself. Not in this case, though.Could it be so difficult to accept that there are movies that can make you feel something like that something is or was real ? Would it be impossible to admit that you loved this movie ?

I was laughing and groaning so much my face still kinda hurts. Like how many times can they almost die? And then when people finally do start to die everyone else is surprised!

I was sorely disappointed. To me it was disrespectful of the people who lost their lives on that ship.As for the acting, Leonardo DeCaprio was quite amateurish and unconvincing. The ""villain"" acting was about as convincing as William Shatner in the Star Trek series. The only acting in the movie that warrants any applause is the old lady reminiscing about the disaster. She was convincing but had a very minor part.Attention to detail in the special effects was awesome. Few movies capture this detail.I would rather have seen historically accurate portrayals of several notable passengers including the captain and people involved in the catastrophe. Shame on the producers for trivializing such an event with a love story.The best movie of that year went totally unnoticed because it was produced by a small Canandian company. The Red Violin was the best movie that year. It was more than entertainment. It had a redeeming message.",Titanic
2453,tap_gal_kenz13,A Movie You'll Love Forever,10,4 June 2006,"I saw this movie when it first came out, and I was just in first grade. It was so mind boggling. I had never seen special effects like it. And somehow, even when I was that little, I still understood the romance and Jack and Rose's love for each other. It's my favorite movie of all time, in my opinion it's my mother's Gone with the Wind or Wizard of Oz. I absolutely love it. I watched it for the first time with two of my friends after not seeing it for many years, and by the end of the movie we had used up 3 boxes of Kleenex. After seeing it again, I was disappointed to see the special effects after movies like Lord of the Rings. There were fog lines around the ship when it was sinking, the sky was very fake and you could tell the background was fake all throughout the movie. But the acting, the acting makes the movie. The love is the most believable love in any movie. You can tell that the story was a love that lasts for ever. Even though millions of people hate this movie, millions also are in love with it, and millions will cherish it forever, and it will go on in the ""Titanic lovers"" hearts no matter what a user vote says.",Titanic
2454,bearsattack,Worst Movie of All Time!!!,1,24 August 2017,"When I finally saw Titanic, I was beyond disappointed. In fact, I've been forced to see this movie many times in recent years and every single time I feel nothing but disappointment. A big complain about Titanic has to do with the ""history"" in the movie. Since everyone knows that the ship goes down Oh sorry, spoiler alerts for those who don't know this historical fact Cameron wrote in one of the most forced love stories I've ever seen on film. Yes, the ship hits an iceberg but the crew actually saw the iceberg minutes before the Titanic went down. However, for some reason the ship didn't change course and therefore, the most devastating part of the film wasn't even accurate. Up time that point, Cameron spent over 2 hours, and did I mention this film is 195 minutes long, setting up a sappy love story. Then in the end, Jack didn't even have to die because there was plenty of room for him to lie next to Rose on that board. Titanic is basically about forbidden love and one we've seen that done better about a hundreds times before. I mean, really? You have a movie about one of those most tragic and horrifying ship wrecks in modern history and we have to spend most of the run time with two teenagers from different worlds who are trapped in a forbidden love story? Come on, Cameron! You gave us Aliens and Terminator 2: Judgement Day, remember?In the end, Titanic is not only THE MOST OVERRATED MOVIE EVER MADE, it's also A TERRIBLE MOVIE.",Titanic

But the acting was cheesy and laughable. I laughed in this movie so much from the horrible acting and sappy, cheesy dialouge. The lenghth of the movie was crazy! It dragged on and on! I actually fell asleep! The music wasn't so great either. That crappy Celine Dion song adds to the cheesinest. This movie also won waaaaaaaaaay to many awards then it deserved! It deserved all the technical and special fx awards, but the other ones............ no.

Well, it's a great movie And if you don't like it then you have no soul LOL OK...well I think the acting is great too and it's nice to see an actress like Kate Winslet who isn't anorexic i wish they had made it longer lol i love it!",Titanic
2460,randjaky,Dreadful when she ship isn't sinking,5,30 October 2021,"Robert Altman said this was the worst movie he'd ever seen. The ship doesn't start to founder until well over an hour filled with some of the most turgid melodrama and dreadful dialog ever committed to film. At the point when Jack overhears that the ship is likely to sink with great loss of life, he says to Rose, ""This is bad."" The director even stages a gun battle in the middle of the sinking, as if one of the most dramatic events in the 20th century needed another cliffhanger. My favorite line in the film: Jack and Rose are hanging onto the bow of the ship as it begins its slide into the ocean and she says, ""Jack, this is where we first met!"" I wonder if there is a Hallmark card for that.The film is gripping once the ship starts falling apart. But I wish the crew had thrown Jack and Rose into the sea early in the voyage as a sacrifice to Neptune.",Titanic

This movie is the best I've ever seen! Its not just a typical love story! If it were jack would of lived and Cal would of died! It would of been just another happy ever after! But no! its the most beautiful love story i have ever seen! Jack cared so much for Rose! He loved her so much! Thats what made most of us cry!There's not always a happy ending thats life real life not just another movie! It has so much emotion! Evertime i watch it i cry during the ""flying"" seen cause i know whats going to happen. Jack helped Rose showed her things and made life better for her.

2462,cristalacatus,"""TITANIC"",a type of drama!",10,17 November 2017,"A rich girl, good family, Rose (Kate Winslet) engaged to Cal Hockley (Billy Zane), falls in love with a poor boy Jack Dawson (Leonardo DiCaprio) and live an adventure few days more intense than living some people in a life. ADVENTURE, LOVE, EMOTION, HISTORY are just a few words that can synthesize exceptional cinematic transposition of a real event that has forever marked the history of the xx century. Although I watched the movie more than 10 times, every time I was enchanted for the first time. Is one of the most loved stories, and since the time when I look at it I leave a conclusion that is, the moment must be lived, just like the two lovers who live your love story in front of all the obstacles I encounter all without regrets. They also feel the intensity of life and slowly build their own world on a wonderful boat which eventually this carefree world of those missed lovers would turn into a painful reality, a real disaster.From my point of view, this film is a masterpiece of all supremacy: director, script, protagonists, memorable scenes, and every review could only confirm my theory that TIME is the most hopeful friend and simultaneous enemy of mankind, but LOVE is the only feeling that can overcome barriers of any kind, especially in limit situations.In conclusion, the film is appreciated by millions of people.Is a 10-foot movie, I recommend you watch him review you whenever you are in a difficult situation even if you do not find solutions to problems, at least you will disconnect from self-destruction",Titanic

2467,DrCerla,Deficient storyline good effects,5,14 December 2005,"As a doctor I quickly realized that the role character Rosemary (Kate Winslet) simply represented a mentally unstable personality disorder. Borderline, histrionic, you decide. As such I can not find it appropriate to romanticize such characteristics. Thus, glorifying mental illness. Also, the male counterpart played by Leonardo DiCaprio is very shallow, and with unimpressive efforts is given too much space in this movie. Somewhat of an anti-hero, got lucky to meet the personality just mentioned. I guess another way to say it is that she did all the work for him in double sense this time. Beneficial is the special effects and all the work on the set. In fact this is the main reason for seeing this movie. Of course the connection to the spectacular historical event is another reason to see it. Kate Winslet despite above mentioned deficiency in the character is a beautiful face and well acted, so for that reason it may as well be worthwhile.",Titanic

2469,sheppsea,"A fantastic film, simple as",9,2 January 2006,"When I first heard about this film I was sceptical to say the least, especially with Leonardo Di Caprio as the lead (this was back in the day when I was young and stupid and thought you only went to a Di Caprio film because your girl friend wanted to see it), but when I actually did go and see the film (with my then girl friend incidentally) I was amazed, I thought it was a fantastic film.I know the film's critics claim that it centres too much on the relationship between Rose and Jack, but thats what makes it so effective at the end, you know the two characters and share their grief as the ship is sinking, it really showed you what it was like for the people on board Titanic, something that just showing you the facts of the sinking would not have done, in this particular sense I would compare Titanic to Blackadder Goes Forth (an English TV sitcom set in WWI), in as much as it may not be historically perfect (although, from what I gather Titanic is not by any means historically flawed), but it gives you a better idea of what the victims of Titanic and of the 1st World War actually went through than any text book ever will.The characters may not be as in depth as some people would like, but this is what ties them to the audience, they are normal people, and on the most part, realistic of what people of that period would have been like.I recommend this film to anybody, I think most people would agree it is not in the greatest film in history, but it would certainly figure in my top 5.",Titanic

On the boat, they meet and fall in love, and have a romance. Their love transforms in passion, but the Titanic as strong as we think ?I love Titanic, because this movie is a true love story who doesn't agree with the social walls.

2477,lenee1912,A Movie Masterpiece,10,28 March 2008,"In a lot of ways I feel that people slightly overlook the wonderful story of Titanic. The movie did win 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. That says something.Titanic is based on a true story about the terrible tragedy of the ship, but with a love story twist.The movie has a beautiful yet simple story of two lovers named Jack and Rose. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet do an amazing job of capturing these characters hearts and bringing them to life in front of your very eyes. They board a ship called Titanic that will change their lives forever. This pair light up the screen and when you see them have their ""moment"" when they first lay eyes on each other. You fall in love with the couple as they have fallen for each other. Their chemistry together just sizzles in no way that you have seen before. They come from different social worlds but that doesn't stop their love.Jack is the artist just trying to get by. Rose is the ""poor little rich girl"" that wants to end her miserable so-called life.Jack gives her a new take on life and changes her views and opinions in a much better way than she could ever imagine.But, as we all know. This couple's fate is a little more planned out for them then we think. I won't ruin the ending. ;)But if you look back on this movie you realize that it has so many different emotions that it captures. Love. Rage. Pure Happiness. Desperation. Passion. Sadness. Everything you can imagine.It has many memorable moments that will go down into film history. The Flying Scene on the bow of the ship with that beautiful, scenic background and the excellent movie score by James Horner playing. Jack Dawson's amazing take on life and that wonderful toast at the dinner scene. Rose DeWitt Bukater's desperation in her face as she runs seeking to end her life...Jack certainly changes her mind. The captain's look when he realizes what happens to ship. The look of terror on Murdoch's face when he sees that iceberg. The passengers cries of help. And of course, the ever popular ending of this movie. Who can forget that? ;)This movie has everything a good movie should have. Amazing actors that have great chemistry together; An excellent story line that isn't complex to say the least but nevertheless impacting; A movie score that is ready to leave you breathless; Powerful quotes that just touch your heart; And an ending that is unforgettable. All in all, I like to call this movie ""my favorite movie"" because it is. And although, it's a sappy love story and some might call it a ""chick flick."" (which of course it's not) It's one of the greatest love stories ever told. <3",Titanic

Maybe going to watch this you expect to see only the tragedy, because people by definition love them. The love story and the humor are not the main pattern in this movie, but the line cannot be followed unless there is a intrigue. The effects are good for 1997..could been a bit better in my opinion.What really amazes in this movie is the greatness and the magnificence. In Titanic everything is on the superlative. We must give the man credit for that! The presentation of each character along with their drama puts you right there, and that is what a movie must do. Go see it! Is a classic already and I guarantee you that you will forget for a couple of hours of your problems :)",Titanic

I was 14 years old when I went to the cinema with my family and some friends the first time. I would have never imagined that one day this film would become one of the greatest masterpieces in the world and that it would have an emotional impact on me. I love Titanic not only for the movie itself but also for the history that lies in it. James Cameron is not just a movie maker but a great poet who talks through his heart to us. He also tells a story in a way never done before. It's not just a love story or a history movie. It's more. It's hard to explain it in words but if one reads the books about the movie one can understand what I mean. I will always thank him for his work. His expeditions made to the relict also impressed me much. But I also want to thank his crew and all the people who worked with him! Also a special thank to all the actors obviously!

However, my brother bought it and persuaded me to watch it, and i must have seen it at least 100 times since!!I love the main story-line between Jack and Rose! Although some write this love story off as 'sappy, typical, predictable Hollywood', it pulls my heartstrings every time I watch it. The beauty of two people so in love, they will do anything to save each other. Especially when Rose jumps out of the lifeboat to go to Jack. She knows she may die, and would have been safe on the lifeboat, but she doesn't care. This scene always brings a tear to my eyes, and on Jacks death I am always bawling my eyes out, every single time. I also love how well the Titanic is recreated, from the interior and design to the dramatic sinking. You feel you are there, and feel the fear of the third-class people locked up, the terror of Rose and Jacks dramatic escape, and most importantly, the love between the two principal characters.. I didn't know much about the ship before, but now am inspired to find out as much as possible. A truly classic film, with beautiful story lines, amazing history and gorgeous music that fits the scene perfectly. Fave scenes: Jack and Rose 'flying', her jumping out of the boat, the two running through the ship, and the very end, where she is reunited with her love.

2488,doanythingtoavoid,the happening called titanic,10,21 February 2006,"the movie titanic was a history in itself; almost as big as the history of the ship. in spite of certain faults, no one can deny the magic & aura of the film. in spite of being completely mainstream & commercial the movie is in no way inferior to any critical or artistic movie made till date. the technicalities are simply perfect. special effects will develop with time, but that wouldn't make titanic loose it's appeal. James Cameroon has ensured that. and then comes the musical score which makes you fly into the world of titanic without actually realizing it.making a movie better than titanic shall be very difficult. the impact of the great tragedy that titanic suffered is magnified and compressed into the span of the movie. it hits like a dagger of tragedy. Still, certain factors were missing from the movie and some characters seemed inappropriately described. where did Spicer Lovejoy go in the end? why did the captain appear so idiotic during the sinking? why didn't Jack get a lifebelt?",Titanic

2490,brendanr_2,Very touching movie,10,16 May 2010,"Well I have never come across a film that so many people either love or hate. I recently watched Titanic for the first time since I was about 12. I am now 23 so I understood it a lot better. I am a heterosexual male and I cried during parts of Titanic. I have no shame in admitting it, and I am pretty sure plenty of other heterosexual male's would of cried as well.I will start off by saying that I understand why people wouldn't like this movie. The romance story is very cliché, and I can understand why people think James Cameron should of focused a lot more on the actual Titanic itself instead of a fictional love story. I completely understand that. What I don't understand is people saying the acting was bad - I strongly disagree with that sentiment. I think the acting was absolutely superb.James Cameron made Titanic by setting a fictional love story against a real historical disaster. He never intended it to be a documentary. If the viewer accepts this then the movie can be appreciated for what it is.I found the love story very touching. As I said, it's very cliché. But the acting from Kate Winslet and DiCaprio is so convincing that you are able to really care about it. I think the scriptwriting for this couple was absolutely fantastic as well. You really understand Rose's situation and why she is drawn to Jack.This movie tugs on the heart strings more than any other movie I have come across. There are some very touching moments. For example when Rose jumps off the lifeboat and back on to the ship because she can't handle leaving Jack behind. Not to mention how emotional the sinking was, and how real it felt. Rose found the love of her life by chance on Titanic, only to lose him when the ship sank. That is heartbreaking however you look at it.The best part of this movie is the final 10 minutes or so in my view. After Rose tells her story, it is revealed that she lived her life for Jack and that over 84 years she never forgot about him. When the camera pans across Rose's pictures (note that at the start of the movie, Rose state's that she always takes her pictures with her when she travels) it shows her doing the things she talked about doing with Jack, and that she had lived a great life just like she promised him.I believe she has passed away in the scene where she is in bed. And the final scene shows her being re-united with Jack in the afterlife, surrounded by the good people who also perished on the Titanic. I am getting a lump in my throat just as I type this. I found it incredibly emotional. I can't really explain it. I think Cameron did a great job with the romance story.The supporting characters also helped make this movie. The characters of Cal, Captain Smith, Molly, Fabricio, Tommy, Murdoch and Mr Andrews were all fantastic. I recommend this movie to anyone.",Titanic
2491,kelsyxox44,The Titanic rocks,10,1 March 2006,"Titanic is the best movie in the whole world i love it so much. Because i love the real Titanic so much .I have watch it about 30 times. It is the Best love story ever. And it shows all the thinks about the Titanic in it as well so that is great. Leonardo Dicaprio and Kate Winslet are awesome in this movie i think it is there best movie ever.All the other actors rock in the Titanic as well. If you want to watch a movie that is romantic, thrilling and sad that will make you cry this is the best one. And the Titanic is my favorite movie ever by far.It is just so breath taking to watch it sink and everything else that happens. I love the Titanic so much!",Titanic
2492,breadlord,Complete and utter dross,1,21 March 2006,"I didn't watch this film until recently because I couldn't stand all the furore around it when it was released, and then I forgot all about it.I wish I had remained so.It's trash in the same vein as ""Pearl Harbour"". Overproduced, overly sentimental claptrap which highlights the lack of imagination in the American mainstream cinema.What exactly do you all see in it? There are much better romances, much better disasters, better characters and better period pieces.Perhaps discussion can help me to find out...",Titanic
2493,mcmind,Titanic,8,4 March 2006,"Okay, who doesn't know what happened to the Titanic, raise your hand. Anyone? Do we know exactly what happened that night for absolute fact? Well, beyond the fact that the boat hit an iceberg, sank, and a lot of innocent people died - no.We have pictures and some dishes and some misc. items that have survived or been brought up from the sight of the sinking, but beyond that we have nothing save our imaginations.That is what this movie is all about. Using your imagination. Taking what we do know about this tragedy and weaving it around a romantic (okay and maybe sometimes a bit classically corny) romance. But what is wrong with a little romance? What is wrong with a story about a young Rose who discovers the possibilities of her whole life through the chance encounter with a ragamuffin named Jack? Through the sadness of the obvious end of the Titanic ship, we can see that Rose has discovered that ""life will go on"" (okay borrowed that from the theme song) and it can be whatever she wants it to be, so she makes the most of it.Personally, I love the film. Whenever I feel like being awed by the beauty of a ship long ago lost, amused by the fashions and mannerisms of the characters and romanced by a bitter-sweet story, I sit down and kick back.",Titanic
2494,fahqmange,Why this movie is overrated,7,7 March 2006,"This movie illustrates very effectively what is wrong with most of major American cinema in the past 15-20 years. It can be summed up this way: It is the triumph of spectacle or style over substance. Way, way, way too often, Hollywood relies on special effects, attractive actors and flashy clothes and explosions. It's not that Titanic is a bad movie by any stretch, but it's certainly not a great movie either. The primary flaw is in Director James Cameron's attempt to write the script. I agree with most of the critics I've read that Cameron has a great eye but a somewhat defective ear. The characters are clichéd, poorly written and in many cases the acting is quite sub-par. All of this goes unnoticed by most people of course because of the fact that most Americans don't read enough to know what good, realistic well-written dialog sounds like (not to mention the fact that character development is all but completely overlooked by most major studios these days so most people aren't routinely exposed to truly well-developed interesting characters). All this adds up to the fact that Titanic, while an entertaining and well-done picture, hardly qualifies as the best movie made in 1997 and definitely not one of the best ever as so many people would care to assert. I think that the provider of the overly praise-laden commentary displayed on IMDb for this movie should A) graduate from high school and remember that people who don't think this movie is superb are actually in the minority and B) watch a few more, older movies, particularly those made with great scripts--like The Godfather, Chinatown, The Usual Suspects, Casablanca, any Tarantino or Hitchcock movie--and those with some great actors--like Cary Grant, Kate Hepburn, Laurence Olivier, Ed Norton, Cate Blanchett, Jimmy Stewart, Daniel Day Lewis and Angelica Huston. Let's stop relying on the box office and the lame Academy of Motion Pictures (who somehow felt that Braveheart, Shakespeare in Love and yes, Julia Roberts deserved Oscars) to tell us what is a quality product.",Titanic
2495,magurofishgood,Most well known romance movie of all time.,5,1 January 2019,The problem is it is too long. I like the ending but overall just too boring.,Titanic
2496,Ashlyn262,Excellent actors,10,14 March 2006,I just love this movie Kate Winselt and Leonardo Dicaprio are really good actors. I hope I will be able to see them in a film together sometime down the road. It is just my absolute favorite movie ever! There may have been many mistakes but it still pulled together very nicely. I could not think of any better actors to have played in this film. The ending was sad but excellent at the same time. I definitely give this movie a ten. It must have took a lot of money and time but they were very successful. I am still torn by the fact that it happened in real life; I am sure it was ten times more devastating then. I recommend everybody to see this film. Thank you for reading.,Titanic
2497,rajawizakaria-69408,Titanic,1,13 January 2019,"Titanic is one of the best films that attracted my attention. It was produced by James Cameron in 18 november 1997 in Londres. It is a romantic film. Titanic is one of the most expensive movies ever made. It has grossed over 1 billion world wide at the boxe office, making it one of the highest grossing films of all time. It received 14 Academy Award nominations and won 11 of them, including Best Picture of 1997 and Best Song for Celine Dion perfoming ""MY HEART WILL GO ON"". The movie tells the dramatic story of the Titanic with Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet as the main actors.
During 197 minutes, Titanic tell the story of a young poor guy Jack (Leonardo Di Caprio) who travels by the gorgeous ship Titanic from London to New York with a big dream, on board he meets a fabulous wealthy girl Rose (Kate Winslet). He fells in love with her as soon he sees this gorgeous girl. However, after a few days the ship hits an enormous iceberg and the tragedy begins to unfold. The Titanic starts sinking.
To sump it up, I really find that this movie shows a beautiful love story with an extremely sad ending. Moreover, the story of the film is very amazing and also the performance of both actor Leonardo Di Caprio and Kate Winslet was so brilliant. I personally recommended to see this film because it's a beautiful movie.",Titanic
2498,jmmonge,worst movie ever,1,15 March 2006,"I think this is one of the wort movies i have ever seen. An awful script combined with awful actors. The only thing i found ""more valuable"" are the special effects, but on a 200 million dollars movie this is obvious. I simply can't understand why so many people loved this movie. It has nothing to be remembered (the car scene is the most remembered, but not because of his quality...), i really think this film is too too bad. Awfully awful. I recommend you to not watch it, because you will regret of it, you will waste your money. That's all, if you want to see the worst movie ever, you HAVE to see it, but if you don't...",Titanic
2499,Amanececonlos4,Is a film that truly gets to your heart,10,26 February 2019,Titanic: Is a film that truly gets to your heart. Leonardo Di Caprio performance in this movie set him in the Hollywood radar despite not giving him an Oscar. The script is carefully think and every detail has been taking care off. Of course the soundtrack is in my humble opinion one of the secrets of the huge success of the movie.,Titanic
2500,dncer_gurl15,An Amazing Movie,10,24 March 2006,"James Cameron takes the story of the Titanic disaster and transforms it into a wonderful, breathtaking movie.The movie revolves around two lovers, Jack and Rose who come from very different worlds. We watch as conflict unfolds with Rose's family and her decisions about Jack. Then the iceberg hits. The movie then turns from a romance to a action/survival story. We are thrown into the devastating sinking of Titanic. Even though we know how the movie ends (the ship sinks) we are still able to become caught up in the movie. Although their are a few questionable parts, the overall movie is amazing",Titanic
2501,lil_ross_28,Titanic,10,18 December 2006,"It's a simple tale, really, made up of equal parts love story, historical epic and disaster film, about a young artist (Leo) from the wrong side of the tracks, who falls in love with a young aristocratic Lady (Kate Winslet) while on their way to America during the fateful maiden - and final - voyage of the H.M.S. Titanic. That pretty much sums it up without really saying very much.What, after all, can you say about a film that has made more money (and faster) than any other film in the history of motion pictures? What can you say about a film that earned more Academy Awards (it tied with ""Ben-Hur"" in this respect) than any other film in history? You can say it's successful, sure, but that doesn't come close to doing justice to this spectacular epic's impact on Hollywood and the entire world.Rumored to be in trouble practically before principal photography even began, the film quickly lived up to it's premature reputation by going famously over schedule (by nearly six months) and over budget (to the tune of over $200 Million). Nearly everyone - Fox and Paramount included - thought the film, upon release, would sink at the box office faster than the ship of the title sank in the North Atlantic Sea so many years ago.Instead, as everyone now knows, ""Titanic"" did just the opposite and, among the other and numerous happy results, is the fact that it instantly elevated Leo from the ranks of Rising New Star to that of International Superstar.One can only wonder why the Academy chose to ignore his performance, but few (if any) would argue that the two most important reasons for the film's success are Leo, and Kate.",Titanic
2502,oneblack_rose1,I LOVED it!,10,29 March 2006,"When I first saw Titanic, I was amazed at how well it was done. The acting was perfect, the directing excellent, and the story-line was also good. Every time my family and I (my mom and I) go to rent movies, I ALWAYS try to rent Titanic. I think it's the best movie I've seen (besides Chronicles of Narnia). My grandparents have never seen this movie. I told them that they should rent it and watch it, because it was a very good movie. It was good. There was lots of drama, which I like. There was also romance woven into the story-line, which I also liked. I think that Jack (Leonardo DiCaprio), and Rose (Kate Winslet) made great leading people in the movie. They worked well together, and I was surprised. That's the reason why I give Titanic 10 out of 10. The acting, directing, and story-line are excellent. If you haven't seen Titanic yet, I encourage you to rent it and watch it. It's a great movie! 10 out of 10 for Titanic.",Titanic
