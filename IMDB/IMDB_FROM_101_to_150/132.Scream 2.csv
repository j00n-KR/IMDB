0,TheLittleSongbird,"Not as good as the first, but worthy",7,15 July 2011,"The original Scream was a classic, so this sequel had a lot to live up to. And it was a worthy sequel on the most part. Though it didn't entirely succeed, the story is less fresh and less original, it is not as efficiently paced and the killer's reveal was predictable. However, the production values are of high quality, the music is still haunting and the sound still unsettling, there are still the funny lines, the genuine scares, the credible direction from Wes Craven and the return of the iconic GhostFace. The acting is still good too. So overall, a worthy sequel, just not quite the instant classic the first was. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Scream 2
1,Leofwine_draca,Follows the first film's formula too closely to be effective,4,11 December 2016,"Wes Craven was quick to jump on the bandwagon he had created with his surprise hit SCREAM, delivering us a sequel barely months after the first. As expected, it's not as good as the original film, and in fact doesn't come close. This time around the emphasis is on comedy rather than horror. SCREAM 2 is witty, clever, and self-indulgent (as to be expected) and it's a bit of fun watching the original cast members go through their paces once again. But this is just not enough.Courtney Cox and Neve Campbell both seem to be competing for thinnest female performer and they look a lot like zombies here. David Arquette offers up some suspect comic value with his limp (he was stabbed in the back in the first film) but the star of the show is Jamie Kennedy, who returns as geek Randy from the first film. Kennedy is the brightest star of them all and the best scene comes where he is being terrorised by the murderer in the park. Also appearing are Sarah Michelle Gellar in a typical pretty-faced role, and Jerry O'Connell who is good value as Campbell's boyfriend.The gore this time consists of stabbing and shooting, there's a lot of blood but no real imagination to the killings (apart from the first death where a man is stabbed in the side of the head through a toilet cubicle wall). Also, again as expected, there are a lot of protracted stalk and slash sequences towards the end of the film, before the clichéd and disappointing finale which could have been a lot better - and more original - than it was. It's a fun film to watch but it's a sequel that covers no new ground and is merely a continuation of the first film. We could have done without it, because honestly speaking this came too fast after the first one and followed the same formula too closely to be as effective. And as for SCREAM 3...",Scream 2
2,SnoopyStyle,Sequel references gives franchise some new life,6,14 June 2014,"Two years after the first movie. Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) has written a book about the murders and it's been popularized in the movie Stab. A new Ghostface rises up to start killing again at a showing of Stab. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) is out of prison with the help of Gale. Gale is too happy to soak up all the publicity. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are students at Windsor College. Derek (Jerry O'Connell) is Sidney's new boyfriend. Dewey Riley (David Arquette) comes out to protect Sidney. There is a whole new cast of characters ready for the killing and ready to be suspects.Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson have return to the self-referencing franchise. Being a sequel, there are a lot of referencing to sequels and what that usually entails. It gives the franchise a new reason to continue. The returning cast is a capable crew. I do have a minor problem with the new additions. They all end up as either cannon fodder or the killers. It would be much more surprising if one of the new people survives.",Scream 2
3,kosmasp,It's scream time,7,16 October 2011,"The movie as it is, is pretty decent. I might have given it only a 6/10 (which is also good), but there is one moment in here, that really shocked me. Something that I guess people who have seen the original (and I am assuming you have in my review), will not see coming (unless they have read about it or someone told them).We have the survivors back and we also have the winning team back from part 1. Craven and Williamson do a pretty good job to continue the story (while not being as sharp as in the first one). While the first one ended with a pretty great climax (so simple and yet so genius), this one cannot top that. But it doesn't have to top it (especially with the great moment happening prior to that), it just has to entertain us. And that it does ...",Scream 2
4,Sleepin_Dragon,Plenty of Screams here.,8,26 January 2018,"People often talk about how poor sequels are in comparison to the originals, but with Scream that is far from the case, the original in my eyes is a classic, it helped redefine the Slasher movie, return it to the fore front of cinema for several years. Scream 2 in some ways is better then the first, the script is a little tighter, it's not afraid to have a cheeky laugh at its own expense, the killings are perhaps bigger and bolder, and they find a way to shut Sarah Michelle Gellar up, who could ask for more.Some of the cinematography is excellent, it's a very good looking film. I think Neve Campbell's stage dance is one of the film's best moments, it works on so many levels, menace and confusion, it is very nicely done, similar to those great moments in the opening sequences at the cinema too, we as an audience are allowed to see what's going on in the midst of the noise and distraction.It loses points for making Dewey a complete and utter idiot, every time I watch this now I can only see his character from Scary movie, but there's little difference between the two. The killer(s) certainly comes as a surprise.A very good Slasher movie.",Scream 2
5,gavin6942,Great Sequel,7,9 July 2015,"Two years after the first series of murders, a new psychopath dons the Ghostface costume and a new string of killings begins.This is one of those rare sequels that has just as strong a plot and writing as the original. Sure, in some ways it may not be as great (can you ever beat the first installment?) but its inclusion of ""sequel rules"" and the introduction of the ""Stab"" franchise? Quite clever.We also get a dramatic increase in star names, which is really saying something with the list of big names in the first. Some are not so great... you know, Jerry O'Connell has never had a good role. Ever. But on the flip side, Luke Wilson nails it in his cameo.",Scream 2
6,lee_eisenberg,as history repeats itself...,10,8 November 2005,"""Scream 2"" pulls off the seemingly impossible task of outdoing the original. With the murders in her hometown now behind her, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now in college. Only the murders aren't over; someone is coming after her and in the process, pulling off murders as they appear in sequels. The rules are: the body count is always higher, and the death scenes are more elaborate. And I gotta say, I didn't see that ending coming.I should warn you that there is a scene in this movie that will probably make you jump. You'll know it when you see it (or more accurately, when you jump). Campbell does a great job, as do Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Liev Schreiber, and the rest of the cast. And of course, Wes Craven affirms his status as one of America's great directors.",Scream 2
7,jboothmillard,Scream 2,5,21 June 2005,"It is necessary in some ways to have a sequel when in the first film it is mentioned, and it is an okay film. The film starts with Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett Smith) and her boyfriend Phil Stevens (House's Omar Epps) being murdered at a screening of the new movie, Stab, based on the Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) book. Now, a new ""Ghostface"" killer (voiced by Roger Jackson) is duplicating Woodboro in a new town and killing people with similar names, e.g. Casey 'Cici' Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar). Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now under close observation by the cops, old friend Dwight 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette), Gail and her new boyfriend Derek (Stand by Me's Jerry O'Connell). The big twist for most people is that the killer is not the man once accused of killing Sidney's mother, recently released and pursuing Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), it is in fact Mickey Altieri (Timothy Olyphant), but it is his partner that shocks, it is Billy Loomis's mother, Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf). Also starring Jamie Kennedy as the still humorous Randy Meeks, Lewis Arquette (David's Dad) as Chief Lewis Hartley, Duane Martin as Joel Jones, Heather Graham as 'Stab' Casey and Tori Spelling as 'Stab' Sidney/Herself. It was never going to be as good as the first, because there are only a few great twists and turns, but it is still some good scripting by Kevin Williamson with one or two scares and some alright giggles. To be honest, I only knew of and wanted to see it because I saw the spoof in Scary Movie before it, but it is a reasonable horror comedy sequel. Worth watching!",Scream 2
8,Tweekums,A horror sequel that lives up to the original,8,6 July 2019,"Two years have passed since the events in 'Scream' and a film, titled 'Stab', which recounts those events has been released. Two people are murdered at a screening in the town of Windsor... perhaps it is no coincidence that Sidney Prescott, the young woman at the centre of the first film is now attending Windsor College. Inevitably the media, including Gale Weathers, descend on the town and Sidney finds herself the centre of attention again. Also arriving in Windsor are Deputy Dwight ""Dewey"" Riley and Cotton Weary, a man who'd spent a year in jail after Sidney's accusation that he'd killed her mother. Once again a killer wearing the distinctive 'Ghostface' mask starts killing people close to Sidney. As the death toll mounts the finger of suspicion points at various people; including Cotton and Sydney's new boyfriend.In the first 'Scream' film much was made of the killers following genre rules. This is followed up with discussions of rules for sequels and arguments over whether a sequel can ever match the original... I think this one might even if it inevitably lacks the original's shocking opening. Instead we get the most self-referential opening I can think of with characters watching a shot-for-shot remake of the original, with different cast obviously... this turned out to be a great hook as it reminded the viewer of that film and them propelled them into the sequel. As one would expect there are plenty of fairly gruesome deaths and lots of tension. The central cast are solid; most notably Neve Campbell and Courteney Cox who are great as Sidney and Gale. The identity of the killer isn't too obvious; I'll admit I was convinced it was somebody who turned out to be innocent. Overall I'd say that if you enjoyed the original you should check this out as it is as good and has plenty to add to the story; if you've yet to watch the original you should definitely watch it first.",Scream 2
9,BA_Harrison,Wes and Williamson do it again.,8,25 October 2009,"Wrongly imprisoned and almost executed for the murder of town bike Maureen Prescott, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) could be forgiven for being a little bitter towards young Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), whose false testimony resulted in his incarceration. But is the recently released Weary responsible for the spate of copycat killings taking place at Sidney's college? With so many candidates for campus maniac to choose from, it's anyone's guess...Scream 2 is definitely a case of 'more of the same', but when 'the same' is of such a high calibre, this really isn't much of an an issue: the film is still an absolute blast and a worthy successor to the brilliant original.This time around, writer Kevin Williamson abides by most of the rules of the horror sequel, as defined by the film's very own movie nerd Randy: the body count is bigger and the death scenes are more elaborate, and definitely messier. Fortunately, Williamson doesn't stick to the notion that sequels have to be inferior: the superbly constructed script, masterful direction from Wes Craven and great performances from an excellent cast (several of whom reprise their roles from the first film) ensure that Scream 2 works like a charm, providing fans with another satisfying dose of fear laced with laughter.In addition to the expected scenes of stalk and slash, the well executed jump scares, and the usual quota of red herrings, there are in-jokes aplenty for film buffs to spot, and umpteen 'guest' stars who pop up in blink-and-you'll-miss-'em bit parts (familiar faces include Heather Graham, Tori Spelling, Luke Wilson, Portia de Rossi, and Jada Pinkett, plus Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart and Joshua Jackson, who would subsequently appear in Scream-alike slashers I Know What You Did Last Summer and Urban Legend).If you loved the first Scream, then the chances are you'll have loads of fun with this one too.",Scream 2
10,Quinoa1984,A Drop off,7,12 July 2000,"I must say this film isn't as good as the first (if that's saying anything) but it is much better than part 3.  I already knew it was better than part 3, but when I first saw this I was conflicted about whether or not this film was better than the first.  Then I realized it waa almost equal in scares and laughs and surprises.  But the first was actually more original (even though it was inspired greatly by many other movies).  Actually though, that doesn't stop anyone from seeing this movie.  I still recommend this film to teens looking for a few laughs and plenty of scares in the Craven tradition. Just don't go watching this film looking for the best horror film ever made, that's all.  Cameos include Jada Pinkett-Smith, Tori Spelling and director Wes Craven.  A-",Scream 2
11,Coventry,"Lesser sequel, but at least they knew it and laughed about it.",5,15 October 2009,"The undeniable best sequence in this film – as well as in all three ""Scream"" films, for that matter – involves the geeky horror connoisseur character Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) fanatically venting about his favorite, albeit cliché-laden genre. As this is a rapidly produced sequel to an unexpectedly successful horror blockbuster, Randy – with the help of an entire movie class - vividly rants how sequels never match up against the ingenuity and intellect of their predecessors. That scene alone is pretty clever already, in fact, because it feels as if director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson want to safeguard themselves against delivering a potentially inferior product. ""Scream 2"" isn't a bad film, especially not in comparison with the majority of horror junk that was coming out in the aftermath of the original ""Scream"", but indeed no match for the first. The screenplay actually does faithfully feature all the sequel clichés, like a higher death toll (particularly near the end, it seems like everybody must die) and a bloodier make-up effects. The film is also overlong and tries to be a little too clever in all its 90's pop-culture observations. Good aspects, however, include the successful change of location from a typical small town towards a university campus. Both settings are typical 80's horror fare settings. The survivors of the original film have obviously grown in their roles and the production managed to attract some interesting fresh new faces for the principal roles (like Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell and Sarah Michelle Gellar) as well as some cool cameos (like David Warner, Heather Graham and Luke Wilson). The plot of the sequel is as simplistic and rudimentary as that of the original. Sidney Prescott and her friend Randy are trying to carry on with their lives two years after the Woodsboro murders. When a young couple gets killed during the premiere of ""Stab"" – a horror flick based on the Woodsboro murders – it quickly becomes clear there's a copycat killer after Sidney. Despite some really good ideas and a few moments of admirable suspense (the escape from the crashed car, for example), ""Scream 2"" is a repetitive and forgettable film.",Scream 2
12,michaelRokeefe,Here we go again. The ghost mask stabber stabs again.,5,20 May 2000,"Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson give us a second helping of SCREAM. Is it art imitating life imitating art? This sequel actually has its own life. The survivors of the original are back; two years after the first frenzy caused by a killer wearing a ghost mask. The body count keeps increasing. The screams end with a non-predictable climax.Repeat performers include Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette. Smaller parts go to Jada Pinkett, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Tori Spelling.Give it a chance. This is a little better than the earlier forecasted criticism.",Scream 2
13,hitchcockthelegend,Wonderful sequel that is the perfect bedfellow for the first film.,8,4 March 2008,"I'm just not buying into the bad rating for this film, in 1996 Wes Craven's Scream reinvigorated an ailing genre and got fans back into the horror groove. The love for that film, I feel, tends to skew opinions of the second instalment in what became the Scream foursome, Scream 2 seams perfectly from its starting point to up the daring ante, and plonk tongue even further into its cheek in the process.Sidney Prescott has moved on from the horrendous murders in Woodsboro and is at college getting on with her life, but the peace and hope for a bright future is quickly shattered because the Scream killer is back for more carnage...The film's opening perfectly sets out the tone for the entire picture, we see a cinema full of fake knife wielding youths dressed as the Scream killer, the film they are watching is Stab, the story of the Woodsboro murders. It's a wry commentary moment from Wes Craven, but in truth it's just one of many he makes in the film, the in jokes about sequels never gets tired, and the boo jump scare moments are all there to enjoy. Red Herrings come and go, and all the great characters who survived the first film are back again. Dewey & Gale get fleshed out a bit more, and one time caged innocent (and chief suspect) Cotton Weary is now a major character just begging us to find out if he's hero or villain.This is a sharply scripted piece of work, it knows its aims and delivers what it sets out to do, it benefits from a brilliant sound mix to emphasise the mayhem, and Craven is something of a master in racking up the tension. To laugh and be scared is the order of the day, so sit back and enjoy a film that to me proves that not all sequels suck. Oh the ending does not disappoint at all either I have to say.Scream 2 is a very worthy and enjoyable companion piece to the first film, very much so. 8/10",Scream 2
14,preppy-3,Incredible sequel,10,25 October 2015,"This is a rarity--a sequel that doesn't suck! This takes place a few years after ""Scream"". Sidney (Neve Campbell) is in college still recovering from virtually all her friends being killed years before. Then a movie called ""Stab"" opens that is a fictional account of what happened. Then the murders start happening again centered around Sidney. GREAT sequel with a wonderful script, mostly great acting and plenty of action. The body count has been upped, the killings are more brutal and bloody and this film is very scary. There is humor of course but it takes a back seat to horror. Well-directed by Wes Craven too. There's only two problems. One is David Arquette. He's TERRIBLE in his role. He appears drugged out. The second is the killer seems to magically teleport himself to where his victims are. This happens at least three times in the course of the film! Still, if you're a horror film like me, you learn how to totally suspend your disbelief and go with it. A fast, funny and bloody sequel. Avoid ""Scream 3"" at all costs.",Scream 2
15,poolandrews,"""I ain't payin' 7.50 to see no Sandra Bullock S*it."" Entertaining sequel.",7,25 July 2005,"Scream 2 starts with the premiere of the horror film 'Stab'. Stab is a film based upon the events of the first Scream (1996), a young couple named Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett Smith as Jada Pinkett) & Phil Stevens (Omar Epps) attend the showing where both are brutally murdered by an unknown masked assailant. The murders are widely reported & it's not long before Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) becomes aware of the fatalities. Chief Lewis Hartly (Lewis Arquette) tries to calm the press who include Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) complete with new cameraman Joel Jones (Duane Martin) once again back trying to break a huge story & thus find fame & fortune. Dwight 'Dewey' Riley (David Arquette) also shows up out of concern for Sidney, Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) who survived the events of the original Scream is still around & to make things even more like old times Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) turns up who just happens to have spent the last year of his life in jail after he was wrongly accused by Sidney. Sidney's roommate Hallie McDaniel (Elise Neal) tries to cheer her up by taking Sidney to a party that very night, unfortunately Cici Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has to stay behind on her own & becomes the next victim. As the bodies pile up so do the suspects & once again Sidney must unmask the killer or pay the ultimate price...Directed by Wes Craven like the original who also has a small blink & you'll miss him cameo I thought Scream 2 was good solid entertaining fun & a worthy sequel. The script again by Kevin Williamson who also has a small cameo doesn't stray too far from the original's roots in terms of tone & feel, but that isn't necessarily a bad thing. Everything you expect is here, the self parody, the witty one liners, making fun of the slasher clichés & genre all done with a nice affection & considerable humour, there is a nice running gag about film sequels, their rules & the fact that their always inferior. Scream 2 moves along at a nice pace even if it could have done with a couple more murders & a few scenes maybe should have been cut or shortened because at 2 hours my interest started to wain towards the end. On the negative side it's not a big departure from the original & the ending which felt very familiar if you know what I mean was a bit of a let down, an anti-climax as it were. But then we all know that it wasn't the end was it? Yet another sequel & the last to date Scream 3 (2000) made an appearance 3 years later. Having said that I doubt you will guess the killers identity. The kills are surprising not very graphic apart from one slit throat which was a bit of a disappointment as one character rightly points out the death scenes in sequels should be bigger & bloodier, Wes Craven I hope your listening! The characters are all very likable & the cast, many of whom return from the original, do a good job. Any film with Courtney Cox, Neve Campbel & Sarah Michelle Gellar can't be all bad can it, eh lads? Technically scream 2 is very polished & well made with nice production values but with a budget of $24,000,000 that's the least I expect. One curious thing about Scream 2 was the fact that I found it a very bright film, a lot of it takes place during the day & in brightly lit rooms for which Scream 2 probably loses some atmosphere. Overall I liked Scream 2 a lot, it's great entertainment, it's not too gory & it's funny especially if your a horror fan because you'll understand & appreciate the jokes & swipes at the genre. Definitely worth a watch.",Scream 2
16,lastliberal,It's a perfect example of life imitating art imitating life.,5,18 August 2007,"I was not as impressed with this movie as the first one. Neve Campbell seemed to be flat in her performance. She really didn't show any emotion until the end.Courteney Cox was the real star of this sequel. She was better than I have ever seen her since 3000 Miles to Graceland, which she actually did after this film; I just didn't see them in order. I really liked the cute reference to her BFF: ""It was just my head, it was Jennifer Aniston's body!"" The best part of the movie was trying to guess the killer. I was so out there and never had a clue. That alone made it worth watching.Let's see what they come up with next in Scream 3.",Scream 2
17,Boba_Fett1138,Typical sequel but still good enough all.,7,21 April 2011,"To be fair, as far as slasher movies go, this is still one of the better ones to watch out there. When compared to the first ""Scream"" movie it isn't nearly as good but when judged on its own, it's a quite good and enjoyable genre movie.There are more than a few reasons why this movie is inferior to its predecessor, that got released only a year before this movie did. First and foremost, it is because it's all not as fresh anymore of course as the first movie still was. The first movie redefined the genre and really brought the slasher genre back again. What does this sequel do? More of the same really, only worse and less original.So the story is definitely less fresh and less original this time, which also makes the movie a bit ineffective at times. I still like the beginning of this movie very much and probably more than the the opening sequence of the first original movie but after that the movie runs out of steam and good ideas pretty fast. It doesn't always manage to build up its tension well, which is probably because it's too self aware of its self as well. The first movie more or less poked fun at the genre and all of its rules but this one takes itself even less serious. This really goes at the expense of all of its tension.The movie also definitely starts to loose it more toward its end. It's final 20 minutes or so just aren't much good or interesting as a climax, mostly because the killer(s) gets revealed after that point but its identity and motivation aren't exactly being the most convincing or cleverly written and very forgettable to be honest. I had seen this movie in the past, even more than once I believe but I really didn't membered who the killer(s) was in this movie.But like mentioned before, as a genre movie this still remains a perfectly good and watchable one. It's a whodunit slasher, with plenty of good characters and also still some good killings. Ghostface also remains a perfect evil killer for this type of movie and it of course doesn't matter who the killer behind the mask is really for the Ghostface killer to simply keep doing his thing.It's also quite amazing to see how many great well known actors appeared in Scream movies, before their big breakthrough as well known stars. That goes for this movie more than any other one out of the series perhaps. Liev Schreiber's role gets really expanded this time and the movie also stars newcomers Timothy Olyphant and Jerry O'Connell, among many others.But what's also a strength of these movies is that it manages to keep most of its crew but also cast together for all of its movies. Basically everyone that survived the first movie returns in this one and play an important role once more. I guess it's not entirely necessary but it still is what makes the series consistently fun and also makes it distinct itself from other long running horror movie series.Don't expect the first movie and you'll still have a good time with this one.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Scream 2
18,Calicodreamin,Worthy sequel,7,22 October 2019,"As explained by randy, scream 2 follows the rules of being a proper sequel. Delivering more murders while avoiding the pitfalls of duplicating the plot of the first movie exactly. The storyline flowed well, the acting was good, and the 4th wall breaks just as funny as the first movie. My only complaint is that it was a bit long, some of the filler scenes could have been shortened.",Scream 2
19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"An idea worthy as a sequel, an execution that almost measures up",7,11 February 2008,"After Scream respectfully made fun of the slasher sub-genre, this sequel was done. In addition to more satire and clever jabs at the films, from the very first scene, this also has some material on sequels in the genre. An obvious choice, yes, but why not? Such would not have worked in the first film, for self-explanatory reasons, and while it may not all be of quite as high quality as that of the film preceding this, there are still points made. The plot is fairly good, but the reveal at the end is just not as effective as the one of the first(which, going by the Trivia, can be attributed to the original script leaking... thanks, guys, *now* will ya just let them make the movies in peace?). There are suspenseful and tense scenes in this, as well, and, as the sequel rules dictate(and as is said out loud within the film), this is bigger than the first. There's more blood and gore(though I'm not sure the death scenes are necessarily better than, or even match, the ones of the original). The characters are reasonably well-done, if the new ones aren't as interesting as those of the first. At least one character of the first gets more of a role. This picks up nicely from the first(not *right* where it left off), and should definitely not be watched prior to watching the first. If you have, however, watched Scream and want more of the same, this'll do nicely. It isn't quite as good, but it is worth watching. Score, music and sound is well-done. This has some good scares, too. I recommend this to any fan of the first, horror and/or respectful parodies of said genre, specifically earlier-mentioned sub-genre. 7/10",Scream 2
20,view_and_review,Mega Megalomania,4,3 November 2020,"As the character Randy (Jamie Kennedy) so aptly stated in the movie: ""Sequels suck. By definition alone they're inferior films.""""Scream 2"" fits that description. It was double the body count and half the sensibility. Instead of me going through the whole who's-doing-it plot I'll skip right to the point in which the movie did a swan dive off the cliff.It's the final scene and the killer has run through just about everyone and now it's time to kill Sidney. By this time I'm sick of the fuss over Sidney. There have been two movies dedicated to killing her and I'm positive the killer(s) will fail again.We find out that a classmate named Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) is the killer (or possibly one of the killers). He has Sidney dead to rights and Instead of--you know--just killing her, he went through his soliloquy detailing his master plan. If that wasn't cliché enough, killer number two, Debbie Loomis (Laurie Metcalf), entered the scene and gave an even longer spiel about why she was doing this. Then, again, instead of killing Sidney she first shot her accomplice Mickey (because everyone who plans to kill Sidney hurts themselves first before going after her). She could've shot Mickey at any time, but she decided to shoot Mickey first to have more alone time with the heroine (who we knew wasn't going to be killed). Debbie Loomis was so long winded she gave Sidney the opportunity to fight back and buy herself some time for the deus ex-machina Cotton Weary (Live Schreiber) to show up and save her. Oh! it was frustrating. I expect more from Wes Craven.""Scream 2"" goes out of its way to poke fun at scary movies while committing the self-same faux pas that all scary movies make. In fact, ""Scream 2"" was even worse with the cinema sins. Didn't the killers in the first episode go through their whole master plan before being killed? The movie was alright for a sequel up until it decided to commit cinematic suicide and become a joke.",Scream 2
21,AlsExGal,Not that original but still OK,6,4 February 2019,"This second ""Scream"" isn't nearly as original as the first which was a great and suspenseful take on slasher films. This one has the high school victim in the first film - Sidney - now in college studying film. For 99% of the people who major in this, a slow descent into obscurity and realizing that your life will be spent as an admin or working retail, not as a great director, should be revenge enough for anybody. But obviously our killer(s?) is/are not that patient.The beginning is tight, at the opening of a film called ""stab"", patterned after the murders in ""Scream"", and you just know who the first two victims are going to be, although Craven's direction and the score make it a suspenseful when and where. The ending is good too, and it is different enough from the ending of the first Scream that you do wonder who is up to what, just like in the first. There are some tells though. There are some particularly - at that time - famous players in the film doing bit parts. Why? I'd say, watch and find out. Fortunately, this film was made 22 years ago so you are probably not going to know who was famous then and who is now because of subsequent events unless you are over 50.The worst part is the middle. It is tedious. You've just got some predictable chases and cat-and-mouse games going on, and you feel like it is just there to fill time between the suspenseful beginning and end. Probably worth your time if you run across it, and probably you are not going to enjoy it if you haven't seen the original Scream first.",Scream 2
22,anaconda-40658,Hardly a Scream.,3,10 March 2016,"Scream 2 (1997): Dir: Wes Craven / Cast: Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Sarah Michelle Gellar: Nowhere near as interesting as Scream. It is basically the standard horror sequel with a conclusion presented upon the most moronic intelligence. Two college students are murdered at the premier of ""Stab"", which is based on the murders of the first movie. Routine hack and slash concealing the killer's identity. Jamie Kennedy pauses to deliver the rules of sequels. ""There is a much bigger body count,"" he confides. Anyone who has had the misfortune of sitting through Friday the 13th, Part 5: A New Beginning or Sleepaway Camp 3: Teenage Wasteland will know that this isn't necessarily a good thing. Director Wes Craven is great at making everyone look guilty but he is actually making the same film. Neve Campbell returns as Sydney who is now in college and pretty much runs the same drill as before including a shocking revelation in the end. Courtney Cox returns as reporter Gale Weathers who gets punched in the face by Sidney again. David Arquette returns as officer Riley who gets injured again. Kennedy spells out the rules of sequels before making a quick exit. Sarah Michelle Gellar makes a wasted appearance after being in the superior I Know What You Did Last Summer. The purpose is to examine horror sequel reputations , which present a higher body count in graphic detail. Score: 3 / 10",Scream 2
23,kannibalcorpsegrinder,"Just as entertaining as the original, but maybe slightly better",9,14 September 2012,"After moving to college to remove herself from her past, a woman and her friends find themselves the target of a copycat killer intending to seek revenge for her previous activities and must stop the hooded-figure's rampage.A fairly worthy sequel, and one that actually has a fair deal going on with it that makes it superior to the original. One of the better elements here is the film's rather emphasized use of suspense after the complete and utter dropping of comedy that ruined the original, which allows those scenes to be all the better. With the frantic scramble around campus to find the intended killer using only the cell-phone usage on campus to identify the caller, the killer appearing amongst a horde of similarly-costumed individuals in a play to a merely breathless escape from an incapacitated police car with the killer in the front seat and no other way out but over them is just a few of the truly spectacular sequences pulled off here that makes this one a lot more creepy and chilling than the original. Also on strong support is a nice body count that supplies some nice gore, some truly clever and original turns in the storyline that not only expand the original as well but provide enough to keep you guessing at this one, and when added together with some fine stalking scenes and excellent use of a school campus to set up some scares, it's got a lot to love. What isn't impressive is the killer's motive, which is an absolute travesty and a complete joke as to its inclusion, it just reeks of trying to be relevant to the times and offers nothing but ridicule, but otherwise this is a solid and utterly enjoyable entry.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",Scream 2
24,FlashCallahan,*69 his ass!!!,6,27 May 2010,"Two years after the terrifying events that occurred in Woodsboro, Sidney is now attending Windsor College in Cincinnati with long time friend Randy.Meanwhile, Gale Weathers best selling book on Sidney's life has now been made into a major motion picture. When two college students are killed in a theatre while watching the new film ""Stab,"" Sidney knows deep down that history is for sure repeating itself again.Gale Weathers is present around the college reporting on the latest gruesome details that her movie has sparked. Dewey comes to visit Sidney after he hears the news also.No one believes the murders were in any way connected to Woodsboro, until more students around the campus are found dead. Gale and Dewey investigate and find that someone is trying to recreate Woodsboro.Sidney is no rookie when it comes to surviving a killer but someone wiser is on campus to show her some good old fashion revenge.More of the same really in this rushed sequel, to cash in on the original. It's ironic that there is a scene with students talking about the poor quality of sequels, because compared to the brilliant, inventive original, this doesn't really have much going for it.The characthers all seem very comfortable in the knowledge that there is another killer on the scene, but they should be, as the majority of the audience probably can guess who will survive the final third.It's not all bad though. the beginning is quite good with the couple being killed in the theater, and Liev Schrieber is fantastic as Weary.Campbell appears to be a bit 'Ripley' in this film, all hardened up because of the events of the original, but Craven and Williamson seem a little bit lost with the film, throwing in nods to past horror movies (look!!! Freddys jumper!!)and silly red herrings every fifteen minutes.But at the end of the day, it's more of the same, just not done very well.",Scream 2
25,trashgang,still delivers good moments but some scene's are a bit too long,7,15 September 2016,"Immediately after the hype surrounding Scream (1996) and the start of a new horror genre it was clear that part 2 was on it's way as soon as possible. Again directed by Wes Craven it should be another hit.Not that it was that bad but some scene's took too long (espescially towards the end) and the plot like in the original one wasn't anywhere to spot. But it is still worth picking up but not that gory as the original one. What was nice is that all characters were back with their original thespians and that did add something towards the belief in the story. Another success it became and the franchise was started. For me it's still okay but not a masterpiece like the 1996 flick. If you look to other flicks that came out picking in on the Scream success then this is a better one then the others.Gore 1/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5",Scream 2
26,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Scream 2,6,11 February 2006,"Given the success of the original Scream, it is inevitable that there would be a sequel, bringing back cast members from the first movie who survived the massacre (Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox), and adding new popular faces that would add to the body count, like the underutilized Sarah Michelle Gellar.In case you've forgotten the iconic beginnings of this franchise, it is again reprised with a movie within a movie, as Gail Weather's (Cox) successful book about the incident has been turned into a movie called Stab, starring Heather Graham in Drew Barrymore's role, and David Schwimmer (not seen though) and Tori Spelling in the roles of Arquette's and Campbell's respectively. It's an incredibly cheesy beginning, which stayed true to the way the original was played out, and guest stars Jada Pinkett Smith too.With the original Scream poking fun at slasher flicks in general, this sequel pokes fun at, you'd guess it, sequels. A new copycat serial killer is in town and stalking Sidney (Campbell) and the surviving gang has to race against time to try and find out who this sicko might be. Could it be a copycat down to the last detail such that Sidney's new boyfriend, an alpha-male jock, is involved? Or one of the surviving cast from the first film? Or how about the innocently accused Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who's released from prison, and wanting to get back at Sidney for putting him in jail? The gore factor definitely has been reduced (or was it because I was watching a Code 3 version?) and relies on the usual soundtrack crescendos to pull in the screams (put intended)? And speaking of the soundtrack, there were moments were Broken Arrow's was used liberally throughout. The in-jokes and numerous references which made the first Scream a darling, were sadly missed in the sequel.The ending again is a twist when the killer is revealed. Though like all predictable villains, a long extended monologue always seemed to be the order of the day. Guess that's just the way the genre goes. Like what was mentioned, there are only a few sequels which surpass their originals, and sadly, Scream 2 is not one of them.Code 3 DVD was a barebones version, nothing special included, which is a pity.",Scream 2
27,whpratt1,Great Entertaining Film!,10,9 June 2004,"Scream #1 was fantastic, however, Scream #2 was able to keep my eyes glued to the screen and was able to have me guessing just how all these killings were being accomplished.  David Arquette ( 'Dewey' Riley), ""Never Die Alone,""'04 put all his great acting talents into this film along with Courteney Cox,(Gale Weathers),""November""'04 who portrayed a TV newscaster trying to get the big story about all these horrible murders.  If you love a real scary film with plenty of BLOOD, this is the film for YOU! ENJOY, especially on Halloween. Some of the gals were very attractive and you just hated to see them get stabbed to DEATH!  If it were not for the great acting of David Arquette and Courteney Cox, this film would be a real downer.",Scream 2
28,StevePulaski,Even louder than the first,9,15 April 2011,"I know the rule of movies; sequels can NEVER be better than the originals. But in Scream's case this rule is broken. Scream 2 is not only better than the original film but it's also got a better group to back the original leads Sidney, Dewey, and Gale up. Jerry O'Connell, Jamie Kennedy, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, and Marisol Nichols all take part in this great sequel and whether their roles are short or long, they are appreciated.Scream did however mess with one thing in it's years; the self aware aspect. It works in this film, and it's good because the film, like I said, knows when to be scary and knows when to be witty. The sad thing is Scream did so well that now it makes other horror films like newer installments of Friday the 13th and I Know What You Did Last Summer feel like they need to be self aware to be good. Not the case.Scream has the right writing and direction to accomplish such a goal. The characters know they are in a real life sequel. Wes Craven knew what he wanted to do and screenwriter Kevin Williamson knew how to be good with references without going too overboard. Nowadays this concept is beyond overused and is now becoming a tiresome and dreary old form of comedy/horror. Only Scream could accomplish it correctly.Scream 2 is relatively the same thing as it's predecessor. Only now the lead characters have all seen a film called Stab which is the movie version of the murders they were involved with. Sort of like Scream is a movie about itself. Following? Well, same formula here. The characters know every horror movie cliché and instead of making the usual mistakes, they come up with ways to do their own mistakes.I like the cast a lot more in the sequel. We get Jerry O'Connell, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Rebecca Gayheart, Timothy Olyphant, Omar, Epps, and even Marisol Nichols has a brief cameo. The cast is perfect. A great addition to a worthy sequel. Normally I don't like sequels more than the originals. But Scream 2 manages to accomplish a bit more than the first.The question at this point is how much more steam does the Scream series have? We have a third film that came out in 2000, and a fourth film in the series, released in 2011. Is Scream going to run itself down? Or will prove worthy of so many sequels and show that you can't ever scream too much?

Mostly just a catch up on how Sydney, Gale, Dewy, and Randy are. The killer comes back to kill them. Or in their words, finish what was supposed to happen(in the first movie).The begining was interesting. I thought it was kind of creative. But a lot of dumb ""she's a stupid WHITE bitch"" type of stuff. I'm kind of getting sick of that. But over all, I have to say that this was a good sequel. They didn't over do it. And I liked the ending. It was very suprising.To Wes, may I suggest though that you should of left it here. I mean how many times are you going to try to kill Sydney?8/10",Scream 2

31,KineticSeoul,Whats your favorite scary movie? Again,5,16 April 2011,"It still brings out the generic slasher flick elements in a taunting manner and sort of makes a joke out of them. Or at least makes references to those horror movies. Which I found to be one of the key factors of why the ""Scream"" franchise to be popular. At least it was the factor that I enjoyed in the first ""Scream"" movie with it's horror movie rules and such. And was one of the reason why it stood out from being just another generic slasher flick. However this time it's less clever from the previous movie, not that the previous ""Scream"" was all that clever and this time it's way more silly. Like one of the quote from this movie ""sequels suck"" ""they are inferior films"" I wouldn't say this movie sucked, but it's inferior to the first ""Scream"". But I really liked how this makes references to the first ""Scream"" movie, it's the most intriguing part of this movie. And although it's inferior, it's still a satisfying sequel. There is more body counts this time around, but that doesn't necessarily a good thing for slasher flicks all the time. This film although puts more emphasis on who's the killer aspect, but it just isn't that engaging for the audience. What I found really absurd about this movie is how, although the scenarios for the killer is coincidental it always goes according to the way the killer wants it to. Decent sequel but just wasn't as sharp as the first ""Scream"". I am going to give this movie a 5.6 because the movie becomes just way too stupid to the point it becomes irritating near the end.5.6/10",Scream 2
32,OllieSuave-007,Part 2 of more screams and slashing.,7,8 March 2014,"This is the sequel to one of the definite slasher movies, where two years after the events of ""Scream,"" Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) are trying to get on with their lives and are students at Windsor College. When Gale Weathers' (Courteney Cox) novel ""The Woodsboro Murders"" turned into the film, ""Stab,"" of series of killings occur and GhostFace returns. Soon, the stalking, phone calls and screams occur again.Filmed in a college setting, the actors did provide another believable and serious performance, providing enough drama and suspense to make the horror film watchable and tense. Scary scenes with the killer chasing the victims left and right and the victims hiding and trying to escape from the unseen killer will send chills down your spine and cover your ears to prevent you from being creeped out at those jumping-out-at-you moments, which are more in abundance than in the previous film; the part where Sidney creeps up to the car to see if the unmoving GhostFace character is dead or alive.With these teen-flick types of horror movies, it has its fair share of corny and lame moments. Sarah Michelle Gellar is my favorite actor, though, in the movie and she took on a role similar to that of Drew Barrymorre in the previous film, engaging, suspenseful and memorable. But, her cynical and determined attitude give the plot more excitement. Overall, not a bad horror sequel.Grade B-",Scream 2
33,thesar-2,Aliens was better than Alien. That's all I have to say.,6,24 October 2009,"When 'Scream 2' came out, now more than a decade ago, I loved it. In fact, it landed on my top 10 superior (or equal to) sequels to the originals. Now, watching the trilogy complete, it's not as good as I remembered it. Sure it has a lot of good points: Courtney and Neve look great! The tongue-in-cheek sequel jokes/statements are great. I always love Olyphant, Pinkett, Jackson and Gellar. And they really up'd the ante on making the now-familiar ""whodunit"" storyline a little more mysterious. Unfortunately, the bad way outweighs the good. Though, I loved the creativity, dialogue and theme to the opening, it was just plain way too drawn out and pointless to the remainder of the movie. (I see how they matched the first movie's intro, but at least that was more scary and interesting, overall.) The rest of the movie follows suit – it's way longer than it needed to be, so much could've been cut. And the coincidences/plot holes were pretty thick. It's years later, they've made a movie(-within a movie, 'Stab') which apparently sparks another blood bath for anyone who hangs out with the survivors from part one. I don't want to sound too harsh; I enjoyed this feature, it has a lot of creativity to it and it's worth watching. It has some intense scenes – my favorite is the courtyard search, but coincidentally it saddens me that my favorite character is off'd during this scene. I can't spoil too much, but the closing (another long and drawn out scene) had me rolling my eyes. As did that horrible 'Top Gun' homage. I am not at all a fan of Jerry O'Connell and definitively not one of the worst actors: Liev Schreiber, and he didn't do much to change that here. Still worth a view.",Scream 2

Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has moved on and has tried to put things behind her. But her new life and her old life soon cross paths as a new killer shows his face (well, not really - he's wearing a mask). Sidney's friends are being picked-off one-by-one and she in a fight for life. For me, Scream 2 isn't as good as Scream, but for a film that was rushed into production and had the difficult task of following a modern horror phenomenon, it's really a decent film. I'll give a lot of the credit to the director, Wes Craven, and a talented group of actors. Craven was a real pro. The fact that he was able to take this bloated script and turn it into something watchable is almost a miracle. He does an excellent job creating tension and atmosphere with several of the kills. I'm probably most impressed with Randy's death scene given that it takes place in broad daylight in a crowded common area. Nicely done. As for the acting, it's a strong cast for a film like this. Campbell is joined by actors like Liev Schreiber, Timothy Olyphant, Jamie Kennedy, Courteney Cox, Jerry O'Connell, and Laurie Metcalf - all more than capable. Very nice. You know, if it weren't for an overload of self-referential nonsense, a 2+ hour runtime in desperate need of editing, and the ridiculous opening movie theater sequence, I could easily see rating Scream 2 much higher.

36,Robert_duder,From Scream to Screaming more...Scream 2 proves horror sequels worthwhile,9,11 July 2010,"The first Scream gave an entire new generation of Horror fans a brilliant series. It only stood to reason they would rush to make a sequel a year later. The amazing part is that Scream 2, in most people's opinions easily sits on the plateau of the original and in some ways even exceeds the original film. The story is stronger, the cast is thoroughly established, and they are in a whole new setting ripe for the Ghostface killer. The film makers are incredibly smart because they stuck to the 'If it ain't broke don't fix it' method by keeping everything that made the original Scream successful and top notch. Best of all they took the incredibly clever satire that made the first one a huge success and turned up the intelligent and fun horror spoofing. The two films together make probably one of the best slasher flicks in the nineties easily. If anything director Wes Craven knew exactly how to keep the success rolling and that makes anyone who loves horror smile because it means you will be ferociously entertained and blown away by something that is smarter and truly a pop culture revolution.The entire original main cast come back stronger than ever. Neve Campbell, Liev Schreiber (really terrific and his character is even better), Courteney Cox, David Arquette, and Jamie Kennedy all come back and are truly better than they were the first time around. Their characters are more developed, we know their background and what they've been through and their older and in a new place in their lives. Schreiber and Kennedy are both better than they were the first time around and more main character. As in the first film Scream 2 gives us a host of hot young newcomers and Hollywood 'It' kids including Jada Pinkett Smith (classic beginning horror scene that she is great in), Omar Epps (same for him), Sarah Michelle Gellar, Joshua Jackson, Timothy Olyphant, Rebecca Gayheart, and Portia de Rossi. Also new to the cast is Sydney's (Campbell) new boyfriend Jerry O'Connell who is really great as one of the male heroes in the film. Him and Campbell have great chemistry as well.There is no question that Wes Craven is a horror master but Scream proved his direction was timeless. He returns to helm the perfect (and superior) sequel and Kevin Williamson returns to pen the script. The setting of the college campus and sorority house would seem to be terribly predictable and yet Scream 2 pulls off their clever satire and poke fun at the horror genre and itself at the same time and at a whole new level even above the original. Unlike other slasher flicks Scream has always been known for revealing the killer in the end and the story and twist at the end fits everything into a neat little package (unlike Scream 3.) Regardless any horror fans needs to see the entire trilogy especially with a fourth installment on the way, but Scream will give you a whole new perspective on slasher flicks, Scream 2 will demonstrate the sequel to a slasher flick exceeding even its original. Watch it!! 9/10",Scream 2
37,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Almost as good as its predecessor.,8,1 March 2021,"Shockingly, 'Scream 2 (1997)' isn't actually much worse than its predecessor. In fact, to phrase it more positively, it's almost just as good. Its story follows on in a natural way and its characters are as compelling as ever. Wes Craven's shrewd direction combines with Kevin Williamson's witty script to deliver an experience that's as self-aware and subversive as you'd expect. It's a really entertaining time throughout, with gripping whodunnit elements that constantly keep you on your toes. It falls down just a tad in its finale, as a couple of its reveals feel a tad 'cheap' (though, thankfully, they aren't cheats), but the affair remains enjoyable right up until its credits roll. It's filled with superbly crafted scare sequences, finely tuned sequel satirisation and, of course, several ear-piercing screams. 8/10",Scream 2
38,bowmanblue,Not bad for a sequel,8,3 June 2015,"Yes, the first 'Scream' movie basically reinvented the tired 'slasher' genre and it's still being imitated to this day. I dare say that not even the producers dreamed it would be as popular as it was. Yet it was. Therefore a sequel was almost guaranteed.The greatest thing about 'Scream' was how 'self aware' it was, constantly parodying its own genre. Therefore, the imaginatively-titled 'Scream 2' had a lot to live up to. Did it? The film itself answers the question. Knowing it's a sequel, one of the characters states that by definition a 'sequel is an inferior product.' I guess he has a case (although the other characters disagree with him!). 'Scream 2' may not be as original as the original (surprise, eh?), but it carries on nicely in the same vain.Neve Campbell (and the remaining survivors of the first encounter) all return (which is nice and not always common in horror sequels) for this outing where, once again, they're mercilessly stalked by a masked killer. Yes, the plot is pretty simple – as was the original and so many slasher flicks before it – but it works, again. The fact is that there's so many awful slasher/horror films infesting the bargain DVD buckets that this sequel almost seems like a masterpiece in its own right.Once again there are plenty of 'red herrings' in terms of characters who may or may not be the killer and I doubt anyone will really guess who's behind the mask until it's too late. Neve Campbell is great to root for as the heroine, but David Arquette does tend to steal the show in terms of sheer lovability! It's witty, it's gory and it's fun. If you liked the first, you should enjoy the second and if you like slasher/horror films in general, you should also get something out of this. Yes, like the character 'Randy' says, it may be an inferior product, but don't let that put you off. And don't think too deeply about plot points – but then if you're a fan of the genre you probably do that anyway when it comes to slasher flicks.",Scream 2
39,ThomasDrufke,A Little Deja Vu,6,4 November 2019,"If for nothing else, Scream 2 is pretty damn entertaining. However, for the most part, we've seen all of this already in the first film, which is an instant classic. More fun twists, another great cast, and just the same amount of gore certainly help propel the film from being a forgettable sequel, though the pacing is noticeably drawn out here. Most horror films work much better at the 85-100 minute window. Not to say the film isn't entertaining or captivating at times, but it's nowhere near the quality of the first.6.8/10",Scream 2
40,Cineanalyst,Rules for a Horror Sequel,8,31 July 2021,"""Scream 2"" is an exception to Jamie Kennedy's Randy's quip that ""sequels suck."" Later, this film-theory student explains the rules of sequels. Although he specifies that they're the rules for horror films, and we may assume specifically slasher ones, there's really only one rule, and it applies to sequels regardless of genre. Neither, as Randy says, are they by definition inferior. These follow-ups are by definition more--more of, or from, the original. It could be higher body counts, more elaborate death scenes, new locations and characters, more of anything and many things. As here, it could mean even more meta-ness. The first ""Scream"" (1996) relied on acknowledging itself as a movie and thereby relishing in or subverting genre expectations by way of referencing other slasher flicks. I think ""Psycho"" (1960) and ""Halloween"" (1978) were particularly important in this regard. Indeed, we get more such references here, but Kevin Williamson, Wes Craven and company seem to have realized that wouldn't quite work again as the principle root of the reflexivity. Instead, the focal point becomes the first ""Scream."" More of it.Indeed, there are two such films now, the real ""Scream"" and the film-within-the-film, ""Stab."" The latter even stars the very actress that Neve Campbell's Sidney remarked in the first film that she feared would play her in a movie, Tori Spelling. Amusingly, other recognizable real actors star in ""Stab,"" Heather Graham in the Drew Barrymore part and Luke Wilson as the killer boyfriend. There's considerable young talent in the outer film, as well, especially from TV shows. Buffy the Vampire Slayer gets a Drew Barrymore-like scene, the likes of Dawson's friend Pacey may be spotted attending the film theory class, Roseanne's sister is a reporter, and Sidney is dating that ""Sliders"" guy this time around. The franchise seems to have been quite adept at using this pool of boob-tube talent, as of course Campbell came from ""Party of Five,"" Courtney Cox from ""Friends"" (there's a good Jennifer Aniston joke in the movie, too, by the way), and whatever else whomever else was in.The opening scene sets the entire tone again, as Barrymore's phone conversation about liking scary movies did the first go around. There's also a concerted effort to appeal to a broader audience with a more diverse cast that includes some African Americans. Thus, Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps attending the premiere of ""Stab"" and mocking the whiteness of it--meaning that of the first ""Scream."" The first kills also address the very real controversy over such titles as ""Scream"" inspiring real-life copycats. This is how the following film class discussion begins, too. I'm not quite sure if this is gutsy, clever self-awareness, a rebuke of the controversy, or a mere thumbing of the nose--probably all four. I do know this was before the Columbine massacre and that after that the same studio, Miramax, locked up at least one violent teen flick that I saw recently, ""O"" (2001).Aside from the randomness of a sorority girl murder, I also like how this opening sets the tone of the killer--or, is it killers again, or is the whodunnit aspect just a silly plot device not worth much consideration (methinks it the latter)--targeting the characters who attempt to decipher the movie. Besides Epps and Pinkett's characters, this is basically just the foursome returning from the first film, but there's a reason they were the survivors. In essence, they answered the slasher trivia game correctly that Barrymore's victim failed.That's the heroine subverting the genre expectations of the virginal goody-two-shoes, Sidney. The film buff Randy explaining the genre. Cox's Gale Weathers, TV tabloid journalist and author of the book that's turned into the movie ""Stab."" She's the in-film author of the first ""Scream,"" in addition to directing its cameraman and even taking the camera into her own hands. And, the Barney Fife deputy (David Arquette) there for the perfunctory whodunnit angle. Sidney had already inherited her centrality in this conflict from her mother, whereas the other three were mere bystanders who got caught up in the last plot. Their newfound sharing of this becoming central characters instead of just sideline interpreters of the plot is especially apt as Ghostface comes to represent cinema, the monster-as-movie. That wasn't the case last time; there, if anything, he was a movie being made, but now the monster is the movie.Much of the rest of the reflexivity is derived from this notion. Sidney isn't just the star and the source of the star in the inner film, she's also a drama major starring in the play-within-the-play, which reflects the outer narrative of her as the prophesizing Cassandra of Troy and of a repeat of the Woodsboro murders. Gale isn't just narrating the story or a part of it, but also a surrogate spectator--going to the tapes and watching Ghostface through the window of the sound-recording booth. The killings, or attempted ones, take place at a movie theatre, a TV van, a projection room, the sound and editing rooms, through windows and on the stage. Masked madmen don't get more theatrical than that, or their victims more cinematically literate, for that matter.Aside from pushing postmodernism to its limits, I still don't think the characters compelling beyond that. The romance between Gale and the deputy Dewey is built up more, but otherwise, and for a picture that's nominally so much about grief and trauma, I don't recall Dewey's late sister, gruesomely slain last time, being mentioned once here. Just goes to show, however, that movies aren't really about life; they're about themselves--movies about movies.",Scream 2
41,CuriosityKilledShawn,Very bad sequel,1,6 August 2000,"Craven used to be known to make REAL horror movies. Sometimes they were experimentation horror films. But now he has fallen for Hollywood's love of cheap scares and loud, loud, loud soundtracks. This film only has one musical cue that isn't criminally loud noise. But it's music stolen from Hans Zimmer's Broken Arrow soundtrack. A soundtrack I love. This kind of made me annoyed the first, and only, time I saw this (well over 2 years ago).The photography in this film is the worst I have ever seen. Almost everything that isn't in the immediate foreground is blurred and out-of-focus. Horror films offer so many opportunities for creativity in all areas of film production. But as this film is made to appeal to mass audiences the style has to be simple. Even terrible. There is nothing worthwhile about this film and nothing to recommend. The part that I hate most seems to be what most people (for some reason) like the best. A class full of film students discusses if sequels are better than originals. That's it. You seethis IS a sequel, and they talk about sequels. Wow! So what?! That's the irony! And it's not worth a penny. I have never seen a more simpleminded and superficial so-called 'horror' film as bad as this. The fact that it thinks it's so cool just makes it worse. The true horror of this film is the horrifying ignorance to the audience. Watch Urban Legend instead if you want to watch a Campus 'who's the killer?' flick. It's junk but it's better than this.",Scream 2

Do not get me wrong the first Scream movie is very scary. This one is scarier. This is one of the scariest movie made before 2000. Scream 3 is scarier. Scream 4 is also scarier. But still this is a very scary movie. This movie has a great story line. It also has great acting. It also has great special effects. See this movie. See all the Scream movies. There are some of the best horror movie of all time. 6.1 is underrating this movie. I give it 10 of 10. Scream will make you scream. But Scream 2 will make you scream even more.

I believe that this movie was a little bit lower than the first one because in this movie we are more prepared about what are we going to watch and one more thing was that the number of suspects reduced really quickly and we are prepared for who is the serial killer.Although I have to say that I recommend this movie because ""Scream 2"" is a really good horror sequel.",Scream 2
45,filipemanuelneto,The parody continues?,6,5 September 2015,"Two years after the Woodsboro murders, Sidney Prescott tries to rebuild her life and goes to college. But, amid all this, new deaths happen and soon all realize that, after all, the masked killer is back. Directed by Wes Craven, has a main cast basically similar to the first film.If the first film was difficult to understand, this film goes in the same direction. If some people found it scary, tense and full of terrifying moments, others thought it was fun, laughed and basically ""supported"" the killer. Wes Craven returns to ""attack"" the clichés of teen and horror films, but this time more gently, giving the film an apparently more serious focus. Nevertheless, and despite the film really looks serious and keen to cause fear, its too funny for it and the victims are still too despicable for us to have empathy for them. Only Sidney (Neve Campbell) deserves sympathy, as seems to be the character psychologically more complex and mature. Interesting is also the transformation of Dewey and Gale: that ambitious and egocentric journalist falls in love with the young policeman, who looks a ""good boy"" who can't break a dish, but is now much more mature than in the first film.",Scream 2
46,TheMovieDiorama,"Scream 2 yells for bigger, better and more elaborate kills but rarely receives them.",6,9 May 2019,"Much discussion is made in the film regarding sequels, outlining a standard set of patterns that are common in horror classics. ""Body count is always bigger"". ""Death scenes are much more elaborate"". ""Never, under any circumstances, assume the killer is dead"". For all the irony and meta dialogue that Williamson slaps onto his screenplay, Craven just doesn't deliver fully. Whether that be a loosely designed curveball to keep viewers on edge, or sheer lack of ingenuity, well that's up for debate. Alas, as good as this sequel is, it never truly exhumed the natural intelligence of its predecessor. Two years after the Woodsboro killings, a copycat killer using the same guise as ""Ghostface"" terrorises Sidney's new college.Satirising several clichés found in film sequels is a pivotal element to Williamson's screenplay. Massive discussions over infamous sequels bettering the original, outlining the tendencies found within them and comedically teasing 'Empire Strikes Back' as a planned sequel therefore being discarded from the argument. Relatable to an absurd degree. The type of conversations I have every single day. So, once again, the dialogue was punchy, extremely meta and gives the characters plenty of personality. The cast was something else too. A young Sarah Michelle Gellar and Timothy Olyphant in the same film? It's poetic! Amusingly, I screamed twice in excitement. Playful performances with an adequate amount of returning characters, raising the suspicion level to glorious heights. Craven keeps the tone light throughout, despite being a glorified slasher, retaining the refreshing aura that made the original unique. Naturally, it's not groundbreaking the second time round, but a watchable sequel nonetheless.There are, however, issues. Beltrami's score was obnoxiously overbearing, with a late inclusion of both Elfman and Zimmer. Various character themes drowned out the dialogue, particularly Dewey's, and relinquished any genuine investment towards them. The narrative shifts between Sidney Prescott and Gale ""You Just Got Weathered"" Weathers made it difficult to distinguish who the main character was and inadvertently eliminated most of the suspects from the list. Quicker than usual. The constant shifts between them, whilst balanced, threw the pacing off considerably with the second act containing zero kills. The death sequences themselves, minus the introductory scene which was excellent, were hardly memorable despite Craven trying to set up more extravagant kills. The third act and final reveal were incredibly messy (probably to do with the famous leak that happened), with seemingly most of the budget going towards that Cassandra play. Oh, and the death of a certain character did not sit well with me (and fans clearly...).Still, even with my reservations, it's a decent sequel that could've been flattened by a lack of imagination. But Craven pulls through, only just. Scream 3 will definitely need to scream harder...",Scream 2
47,BaronBl00d,Film Planted Firmly in Cheek,6,15 January 2005,"Wes Craven is back again at the helm of Scream 2, his followup to the mega-successful Scream. As sequels go, one could do a lot worse than this film. Sure, it has a pretty silly story trying desperately to cling to the original source material, but it never ever takes the story too terribly serious. How does Craven do this? He laces the film with all kinds of film references and humour directly tied to the film industry and actors involved. Several mentions of ""Friends"" cast members abound whilst having Courtney Cox return in her signature role as Gail Weathers. Craven also brings back the rules to horror films - now horror sequels; these rules are right on mark too(wish we had heard the most important!). In fact my favourite scene in the whole movie is in a classroom where students debate the inferior sequel to the superior original. Excellent examples are given to support one argument that sequels are better: Aliens and Terminator 2, and of course, The Godfather 2. Naturally this small cross section seems great when none of the hundreds of truly bad sequels are mentioned. Purposely I am sure! Is Scream 2 better than Scream? No way. It doesn't have nearly as much punch to it. The opening scene this time takes place in a movie theater, but it is not as powerful as the opening scene with Drew Barrymore in the original. The story is really something unto itself as well...but any kind of examination of plot other than a cursory one would give too much away. Not that that would be any great pity. I did like the acting in this one more. Arquette returns as Dewey affecting some kind of limp and pinched nerve in hand. He does a fairly nice job. Cox is lovely as ever and also is good in her role. Campbell is OK, as is the rest of the cast with Jamie Kennedy again standing out as nerdy movie maven Randy Weeks and, in particular, Liev Screiber doing a wonderful job as Cotton Weary(the man who had been accused of killing Sidney's mama). This sequel has more blood, more deaths, and more jokes. Like the original, I too enjoyed this film for its entertainment value if nothing else.",Scream 2
48,insomniac_rod,Fresh sequel.,7,23 May 2011,"Sure it's not as fresh and dynamic as the original but offers some pretty damn good moments such as the whole on-screen duo who commits murders, nice camera work, interesting settings, remake of nasty death sequences (all about ""He Knows You Are Alone""), witty characters (Randy rocks), and the always effective score.Changing the rules is not always positive but in this case, this sequel re-affirms the effort of the original in changing the slasher sub-genre. The plot is interesting and you can say ""you saw it coming"". ""Scream 2"" doesn't tries to be anything more than it is: a modern 90's slasher that goes with the flow.P.S. I love Courtney Cox's legs in this one.",Scream 2
49,jzappa,Blame the Media!,8,20 May 2010,"Scream was a cutting-edge film, the first horror movie in which the characters had seen other horror movies, knew all the conventions, and didn't make the barefaced boo-boos without letting us know that's what they were. In Scream 2, the characters have seen a movie about the first killings, and are caught once again in a slasher fantasy. Like all sequels, this one is a see-through endeavor to cash in on the original, but, naturally, it knows it is, and features its own educated discourse on sequels. The finding is that a mere handful of sequels have been as good as the originals; the characters particularly like Aliens and The Godfather Part II. As for Scream 2, it's, well, about as good as the original. Both movies use a narrative contraption for making the audience flinch and gasp and grasp their pillows. The shocks this time come from a mad slasher in an oddly unsettling Halloween ghost mask, who ambushes a slew of college freshmen who lived through the initial murders. The killer is also concerned with such hangers-on as a TV newsman and a physically and emotionally wounded former deputy sheriff.Kevin Williamson's basis this time is that violence is swiftly rendered into commercial ritual by the media: Because he is doing that very thing in Scream 2, there are paradoxes within paradoxes here. The movie is so expressive about what it's doing, in fact, that you can't knock it on that basis because it gets there first. Do movies prompt people to commit violent acts? Scream 2 seemed to think so, or is that a mocking position, to make the movie more effective? Have movies like this, by enlightening its audience to the traditions and ridiculous banalities of horror films, pacified their violence and make them less apt to be persuaded by the violence? Now there's an interesting thought.The movie's brilliant beginning sequence involves a theatrical premiere of Stab, a movie based on the killings in the first film, and at the screening two audience members are, well, see for yourself. Soon the slasher has moved to a neighboring campus, where survivors including Sidney Prescott are students, and the wounded Deputy Riley has found a job as a security guard. Also loitering is TV newswoman Gale Weathers, who---this is priceless satire---covered the first murders and wrote a best-seller about them that became ""Stab"" and has thus influenced the new murders. Also brooding around is Cotton, accused by Gale in the first film but found innocent, and now urging a second helping of his 15 minutes of fame. There is no way to predict the identity of the killer, and everyone who acts leery is (almost) certain to be innocent.The Williamson screenplay employs the horror scaffold as a rocket platform for considerable parody. I'd like to have seen him work on a more serious film. When Courteney Cox, playing the TV newswoman, is asked about her nude photos on the Internet, she replies, ""It was just my head. It was Jennifer Aniston's body."" And a killer says he wants to be caught, because he's already determined his plan of action: ""The movies made me do it,"" he'll proclaim, and he plans to have Bob Dole as a witness for the defense. ""I'll get Cochran!"" he boasts. ""The Christian Coalition will pay for my defense!"" Wes Craven was made to direct the Scream films. One of the most productive of horror filmmakers, he made The Hills Have Eyes and the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, and was already headed in the same metatextual trajectory as Williamson when he wrote and directed Wes Craven's New Nightmare in 1994, which took his own series' blurring of reality and nightmares to a new extreme, Freddy crossing over to attack the filmmakers in the ""real"" world. There's a difference here in the Scream movies where an all-new slasher killer causes the post-modern irony to be more disguised, and what might be the most ironic thing about these ever more ironic movies is that it resuscitated the entire genre. Spawning countless imitations, the joke is on them!",Scream 2

51,FiendishDramaturgy,Wes Craven Does It Again! Only BETTER!!!,9,2 October 2003,"The movie ""Stab"" has just been released. Based on the actual events in Woodsboro, and the national best-selling book by Gail Weathers, the publicity and following of the movie are astounding. The movie-goers don the the costume distributed by the studio, and everyone looks like the killer. When a movie-goer is killed, no one knows who the actual killer is, as they are all dressed alike. Back with the original cast (YAY!), director (BIGGER YAY!), and complete with the same respect given to other horror films of our time, this movie even surpasses the original. The edge was still there, the suspense was brilliantly recaptured and the humor was dark and witty; clever and intelligent. All the successful key elements were present from the first installment of this series: the acknowledgment by the characters that they are still in a horror movie; the use and discussion of other real movies thereby perpetuating the homage factor of thees movies; and the well developed, believable, lovable characters.""You think someone is trying to make a real-life sequel?"" dramaprofessor.PLOT: The killings have begun again. With the arrest(s) made in Woodsboro from the last rash of tragedies, everyone thought it was over. But Sidney's life just is not built that way. ""To think this fuss is all because of you. I mean, not directly, but in some 'Six-Degrees-of-Kevin-Bacon' way.""With the return of Gail Weathers and Dewey Riley, it hits both Sidney and Randy that this is really happening, again. ""Wow. Nothing like a funeral to bring the family together."" Randy.At the release of Cotton Weary from prison, Sidney is confronted with him face-to-face without warning or preparation. Needless to say, it doesn't go very well, and leaves Cotton standing there with his face hanging out, still waiting for his ""10 minutes of fame.""Meanwhile, Gail's book has defamed Dewey and he is none too happy about it. His pride is wounded and he has an axe to grind; primarily over Gail's head. His role is expanded and he gets far more screen time in this installment, which I found refreshing and his character to be delightful.As hard as it is to make a good sequel, incredibly Wes Craven manages to surpass the original and manages to truly SCARE us without being repetitive, redundant, predictable or boring. Amazingly well done, highly entertaining and a classic in the genre of horror.The suspense element is never cheapened, the element of surprise is always present and the performances by all involved is completely professional, believable and creatively presented.This production has well earned its reputation as a masterpiece in the horror field.The first installment of this series got an 8.89/10. This one rates a 9.42/10 from...the Fiend :.",Scream 2
52,freemantle_uk,"A strong, knowing sequel",8,18 December 2011,"Wes Craven is of course a legend to horror fans for his work on films like Nightmare on Elm Street and The Hills Have Eyes. He was the perfect man to make Scream, a post modern homage and comedy of slasher films but also a good slasher on its own. Writer Kevin Williamson originally wanted to make Scream a trilogy, so getting Wes Craven was a sensible decision to keep the series going.A year after the events of Scream a film has been about it, ""Stab"". During a preview screening two university students (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett) are murdered in a crowded cinema. The media descend on the university which the hero from the first film, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is studying at. And it all seem like it was going well for Sidney who seem to get her life back on track. But the survivors of the first film become the targets of the new ghost face killer as the body court starts to raise.Like the first film there is sharp dialogue throughout, there is insight about horror genre and theories about whether violence in film influence violence in real life (I personally think that rubbish because if you got violence tendencies you don't need a film to influence you) and it both a commentary on the genre and social attitudes. Even if Scream and Scream 2 were made as straight forward slasher films they would seen be better then most because the character are more likable and believable then in most slashers, making you care for characters if something happens to them. I also really like Craven's way of shooting chases with the way the camera follows the action of someone being chased in a easy to follow yet tense way. Paul Greengrass should take note that a scene can be tense without the need of shaky cam preventing the audience working out what's happening.The acting is decent enough. Courtney Cox's character Gail Weathers grows to be a little more softer and likable with more tender scenes. Campbell is very solid as the lead, forced back into a situation she thought she would never face again. But after going through all this twice I would have thought she would be psychological scarred for life. Elise Neal and Pinkett basically play typical sassy black women, especially Pinkett who is also a woman with an axe to grind about women's and African American's rights. Jerry O'Connell who plays Sidney's boyfriend is made out to be a decent bloke if a bit of a preppy. I personally thought that Liev Schreiber was a bit of a weak link because I really did not buy into performance and his looked like he was on autopilot.Scream 2 is also filled with subplots, one of them being the three other survivors believing one of them is the killer and they go on the search to find out who it really is and one able Cotton (Schreiber) wanting to get Sidney to agree to an interview about how her evidence got him arrested for her mother's murder and so he could put his side of the story out to the media. There were well handled and did not distract from main plot which a fast paced affair. The scene on the university court yard was an additional tense when characters try and find Ghostface.The film starts off being very similar to the first film, a 10 minute prologue, the police and media going crazy, the debate of film and Sidney punching Gail, it is still different from the first and not just a repeat of Scream. For the most part Scream 2 still plays on horror clichés like two characters arguing a case about whether to run or check to see if the killer is dead and have a valid argument. But sometimes Scream 2 does fall into the cliché trap like a cop having a chance to kill Ghostface or the characters splitting up when Ghostface is around. But it still a strong, entertaining knowing horror film.",Scream 2

55,MaxBorg89,"Still fun, but less clever than the original",7,14 April 2007,"How do you make a sequel to a horror film whose whole plot was made of in-jokes and film references? Easy: make the follow-up even more in-jokey and self-referential than its predecessor. This formula actually seems to work for Scream 2, at least in the first two acts.The prologue is arguably a masterclass in self-irony: an African-American couple (Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett Smith) go to a movie theater where a new horror film, called Stab, is screening. This flick is based on Gale Weathers' (Courtney Cox) book The Woodsboro Murders, which recounts the events of the first Scream. As the movie begins, Smith's character complains about Stab being a film ""with no black people in it"" (just like Scream was), and, predictably, this leads to the two African-Americans being brutally murdered as the film-within-a-film's prologue (with Heather Graham replacing Drew Barrymore) is shown on the screen, so that the fictional and real deaths occur almost simultaneously. From there on, things take the usual turn: the media go crazy about the killings and once again Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is in the spotlight, as she and her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy) must protect themselves from the new foe, who is apparently mimicking what happened in the past (an obvious reference to the first film's ""Movies don't create psychos"" line).The main charm of the original Scream was its ability to almost seamlessly combine clever in-jokes and a believable plot. This time around, the in-jokes are the best thing in the movie, while the story, particularly in the overblown conclusion, suffers from merely repeating key scenes from the first film. Now, this might be a satire on the lack of originality in most horror sequels, and it would work if the characters were developed correctly. Sadly, such a thing doesn't happen, with Sidney being reduced to the usual girl who keeps running and screaming (fitting, huh?) and everyone else (including Liev Schreiber, who gets more screen-time in the sequel) playing stereotypes, with the exception of David Arquette, very likable as the nice cop again trying to solve the case, and Kennedy, who has a great time stating the rules to follow in a sequel.Ironically, the movie's funniest scene has a bunch of film students discussing follow-ups that are better than the originals. And while few could have anything bad to say about Aliens, Terminator 2 or The Godfather: Part II, it must be said that Scream 2, while fun and watchable, most certainly doesn't have the same sharpness that made its predecessor an above-average horror film.",Scream 2

57,drownnnsoda,"Not As Amazing As The First, But Still Good.",7,9 June 2007,"""Scream 2"" picks up from where ""Scream"" left off, with Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), who is still dealing with memories of the murder spree that she survived in her hometown of Woodsboro during her senior year of high school. But Sidney is off to college now, and things are beginning to look up. She has a good best friend, Hallie (Elise Neal), and a love interest, Derek (Jerry O'Connell). But after a murder that occurred in a cinema (that was incidentally showing a movie based upon the murder spree that Sidney survived), the memories flood back, and another masked killer in the same attire begins to murder those around Sidney - but who is it behind the mask? A follow-up to Wes Craven's 1996 horror hit, ""Scream"", this slasher sequel is a guaranteed good time. Kevin Williamson returns to write the script for this film as well, and crafts a fairly solid story to continue the series with. The opening of this movie (the cleverly-executed cinema murder) was fabulous, and is probably the most memorable thing about this movie. There is some tongue-in-cheek humor to be found as well, but nothing over the top - this film remains fairly serious despite it's poking at the horror genre rules, which is something the original did quite well. I have to give Mr. Craven and Mr. Williamson some credit for their clever handling of these films, because they really are well-done horror movies.Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy return from the original, all giving good performances. Some new additions to the cast are Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett Smith, and Sarah Michelle Gellar (who starred in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" the same year), to name a few. The acting is on-par for the most part, and I liked the casting. The atmosphere in this film is much different than the small-town feel the original had, which I personally preferred - then again, you can't have a movie like this take place in the same town for a second time. There are plenty of surprise moments as well (and some clichéd jump-scares), but the conclusion was probably the biggest surprise of all. I never saw it coming, and I don't think most people would because the writing was so well done. Overall, ""Scream 2"" is a worthy sequel to a groundbreaking horror movie. Did I like it better than the first? No way, I prefer the original, but that doesn't mean it was bad at all. It was entertaining, spooky, and had enough twists and turns to keep nearly anyone's interest. ""Scream"" fans will be surely pleased with it. And as far as horror sequels go, this film ranks pretty high. 7/10.",Scream 2
58,kluseba,The best part of the series convinces with more focus on the best characters and a sinister atmosphere,6,27 April 2011,"After a rather superficial first part, the second movie of the Scream series has been a step forward. The scarface killer is more intelligent, more brutal and more mysterious and a couple of surprises keep you hanging on until the end of the movie. The second part also focuses more on some of the stronger characters of the first part such as the intriguing and wrongfully suspected Cotton Weary, the journalist Gale Weathers that shows some unknown emotional sides beyond her facades of a seemingly egoist personality and the police deputy Dewey Riley that turns out to be much more clever and courageous than it seemed in the first part where he got completely dumped.On a negative side, the opening scene in the cinema shows already the main fan base of the first movie and one realizes that the main concept didn't change as the movie desperately tries to parody its predecessor, to include some stereotypical citations of classic horror movies and to introduce some new stupid teenage characters. The final conclusion to this movie is even more stupid as the ending of the first part and somewhat lacks of originality. That means that you still have to switch your brain off and look over details concerning annoying characters, horrible dialogues or lacks of originality in the script.Overall, this movie has still more suspense than the first part, concentrates on better actors and has a higher degree of dark atmosphere. It's a gripping flick that concentrates as much on the entertaining and humorous side of the movie as on the mystery and horror factor. I would say that this movie is easily the best part of the series until now but it can't mess with the classics of the suspense or horror genre.",Scream 2
59,davispittman,Slightly better than the first,8,30 March 2017,"Scream 2 is slightly better than the first scream, I did enjoy the first movie, but I enjoyed this one more. Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox are still just as good as they were in the first movie, their characters haven't changed all that much. You know they say that sequels to movies, especially to scary movies, are usually pretty horrible, but that's just not the case with this film, you get the feeling that they actually tried and put some effort into this one and didn't just phone in another cheesy slasher romp. Some of the scares are the traditional jump scares and usuals that everyone is used to, but they are still pretty fresh and they work. The acting is good and I enjoyed the performances. The gore factor isn't as much present as it was in the first one, but it's still very much there, so just be aware that that's there, in case you're someone who gets squeamish easily or just hates seeing blood. The plot is what you would expect, but with a few twists and turns that you probably won't see coming, at least I didn't, but maybe you're more attentive than I am lol. I personally really enjoyed those plot twists, I thought they were clever and well done. The writing is pretty average for this kind of film, it's similar to the first.

60,hu675,My favorite of the three films.,8,15 October 2008,"Two years has passed... the infamous murders at Woodsboro has turned into a movie. Since the novel is written by reporter Gale Wheaters (Courtney Cox). Two college students (Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps) were killed in a sneak peak of a horror movie called ""Stab"", which is based on Wheaters' book. Now Sidney (Neve Campbell), Randy (Jamie Kennedy), Dewey (David Arquette), Gale and Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) find themselves in danger. This killer certainly wants something from Sidney, so she's also putting her boyfriend (Jerry O'Connell) and her two friends (Timothy Olyphant & Elise Neal) in deep trouble as well.Directed by Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, The Last House on the Left, Shocker) made an truly enjoyable sequel to ""Scream"" that is even more entertaining and funnier than the original. The script by Kevin Williamson (Cursed, Teaching Miss Tingle) certainly made some truly fun writing about the rules of a sequel. This was just as a blockbusters as the original was. Some film critics (For example the late Gene Siskel) felt the sequel was much better. There's an amusing film within the film, which those scenes are directed (uncredited) by Robert Rodriguez (Spy Kids Trilogy, Grindhouse, The Faculty).The Original DVD has an sharp non-anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes Cast & Crew information and the original theatrical trailer. The only flaw in the sequel is the conclusion, which is a bit too much. ""Scream 2"" has many funny moments as well for suspenseful moments. A good cast certainly helps.

Unfortunately, while he provides some clever insights into the secrets of the sequel, ""Scream 2"" lacks something vital; a plot. Kevin Williamson was unable to provide any sort of story line.The survivors of the first film - Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox and David Arquette - return for more as they are again terrorised by a knife-wielding nutter.

64,aidanratesmovies,A lifeless corpse of a hardly breathing franchise,3,17 November 2019,"Though the film isn't dull in EVERY aspect, Scream 2 feels like the stereotypical horror sequel cash grab it knows it is, only at times worse. By being self aware, many believe the Scream franchise to be a smart retelling of what would happen in real life, but really, as smart as this concept could be, it seems held back by its own hypocritical antics, and this film is especially no exception. Filled with stereotypes and cliches galore, the film feels like one eye roll after another, and eventually you just give up on believing it will truly make any impact, or for that matter, any sense at all. The actors give it their best shot, but with a screenplay that seems to stubborn to life the veil on what it could be, it hardly gives them any grace for it. The film is shot well, but as obvious as it is, looking good and being good are two very different things, especially when it comes to film. In the end, Scream 2 is a vapid bland sequel that is exactly what people would expect it to be, and nothing more. It may not be entirely predictable, but most of the time it is certainly not enjoyable.
My Rating: 2.75/10",Scream 2
65,adamjohns-42575,"""Gail Weathers reporting!""",7,6 October 2020,"I think I like this one just as much as the first. It still has that tongue in cheek humour and doesn't take itself very seriously at all and you still start off with no idea who the killer is and actually, I could only remember part of the ending, so I still managed to be surprised.What I think is good about this one is that once again we are faced with a list of people that could be the serial killer/s (After all, there was two last time, why not three of four this time, or is it in her head, is she dreaming, is it a real ghost?).
There are the ones returning from the original film- Sidney, who could have lost the plot after her trauma and become a psycho? Gail, who might be trying to get her book to the bestsellers list? Randy, who might be trying to prove a point about horror movies and their sequels? And Officer Dewie, who may have decided that he's sick of having the piss taken out of him?
Add to that a new Cameraman, Policeman, College Professor, Buffy The Vampire Slayer News Reporters, The Fat Kid from Stand By Me, Ellen's Girlfriend and her eyebrows, College Friends, Sidney's absent father or dead mother, who could still come back from the grave? And you are spoilt for choice and let's not forget of course, Cotton Weary, who has just been released from prison and would probably have a little grudge against Sid for putting him there.Once again, it is fast paced and witty. It is kept interesting and guides you through with it's digestion of horror flicks that have gone before. There are admittedly some bits that are a stretch and make it hard to believe in places, but you're not meant to take it so seriously.",Scream 2
66,rbverhoef,Pretty good sequel,6,13 December 2003,"The funny thing with 'Scream 2' is that it's not as entertaining and good as 'Scream' but with bad movies like 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' and 'Urban Legend' it's kind of a relieve. Probably the difference here is that Wes Craven is  a director who knows what he is doing.Neve Campbell as Sidney, Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers, David Arquette as Deputy Dewey and Jamie Kennedy as Randy return for this sequel. New possible subjects or suspects are Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Hallie (Elise Neal), Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), former suspect Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) who was in prison for a year, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and reporter Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) who is a big fan of Gale.The movie opens in a theater. The movie 'Stab' is showing for the first time and this movie is based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' by Gale Weathers. In 'Scream' Sidney predicted that Tori Spelling would probably play her if they would ever make a movie about those events and in 'Scream 2' we learn she was right. It is one of the many funny little things. Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps are killed during the showing and of course the movie is blamed.From here it is like 'Scream'. The guessing can begin. Again it is a lot of fun, again the movie knows that it must not get too serious, again I was entertained by what I saw. 'Scream' was original and therefore better, more entertaining and more surprising in the way the subject was handled. Still, with all the inside jokes and references this is a lot of fun and a lot better than almost every other movie in the genre.",Scream 2
67,masonsaul,Incredible sequel better than the original,9,29 August 2019,"Scream 2 is an incredible sequel, a smart, thrilling and self-aware horror sequel that effectively plays with the generic conventions of horror sequels. Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox and Jamie Kennedy all give great performances once again. Liev Schreiber also gives a really good performance with his increased screen time. The music by Marco Beltrami is fantastic. Wes Craven's direction is amazing and actually fixes the problem with the last film as there are less fake jump scares, even if some are still unfortunately present. Overall, it's surprisingly better than the original.",Scream 2
68,a_chinn,"More of the same self-relative horror, enjoyably balances mock and slasher film goods",7,30 December 2018,"Director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson re-teamed for this unneeded but entertaining sequel. Also returning is a majority of the original cast (Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, and Liev Schreiber), where the story picks up two years later with Campbell attending college when a new killer dons the Ghostface mask and stalks her and her college pals. As with the first film, everyone is a suspect and most importantly the film strikes a nice tonal balance of mocking slasher film conventions while also delivering the slasher film goods. Jamie Kennedy's video store clerk, now a film school student, at one point explains the rules for horror sequels, stating ""there are certain rules that one must abide by in order to create a successful sequel. Number one: the body count is always bigger. Number two: the death scenes are always much more elaborate - more blood, more gore - *carnage candy*. And number three: never, ever, under any circumstances, assume the killer is dead."" and ""Scream 2"" delivers on all three of these points. Besides meeting those sequel requirements, Craven is a master of suspense and shock and as with the first film, for a mainstream picture, he does deliver a shockingly rough horror film. Craven actually had to submit eight different cuts to the MPAA before getting an R-rating, so there's no mistaking that this film was from the same guy who made ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""The Hills Have Eyes."" The film is also immensely helped by a strong cast of new characters that include Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Sarah Michelle Gellar (interestingly playing a helpless blond character-type, the antithesis of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, which she was playing at this same time), Timothy Olyphant, Jerry O'Connell, Laurie Metcalf, Rebecca Gayheart, an unrecognizable Portia de Rossi, and the great David Warner in a small role as a drama teacher. Best of all are the very funny cameos for the movie-within-a-movie ""Stab,"" where Heather Graham plays the Drew Barrymore part form the first film and Tori Spelling & Luke Wilson play Campbell and Skeet Ulrich's parts (an inside joke from the first film where one of Campbell's friends asks her ""If they make a movie about you, who's gonna play you?"" and she answers, ""With my luck, they'd cast Tori Spelling.""). Look fast for a before-he-was-famous Adam Shankman as a Ghost Dancer and Selma Blair has an uncredited appearance (or is heard) as Gellar's friend on the phone. Also, the film was edited by Patrick Lussier, who'd later go on to direct the solid ""My Bloody Valentine"" remake, Nic Cage's ""Drive Angry,"" and was co-writer on under appreciated Terminator sequel ""Terminator Genisys."" My main complaint about the film is that Williamson's script hasn't aged all that well, seeming at bit too clever for itself, reminding me in many ways of the endless Tarantino wannabes of this era, where pop culture references were lazy substitutes for good dialogue, interesting characters, or original stories. Still, while this sequel basically covers the same ground of the first film, it's a strong cast with a talented director making a big budget slasher film, which is not something horror fans are treated to very often. FUN FACT! Robert Rodriguez (""Desperado"" ""Sin City"" ""Machete"") directed scenes of ""Stab"", the movie-within-a-movie.",Scream 2
69,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Great follow up to a modern classic,9,16 November 2018,"I first watched this film when it came on VHS. I really enjoyed the original and was excited that they made a sequel. It didn't hurt the original was one of my favorite films at the time. I really liked that they also brought back a lot of characters as well. To get into this, the official synopsis is two years after the first series of murders, as Sydney (Neve Campbell) acclimates to college life; someone donning the Ghostface costume begins a new string of killings.This sequel is quite interesting in that it really takes the meta feel to the next level. The events for the first film have been made into a movie. A sneak peek is being shown at a theater by a college. A couple, Maureen (Jada Pinkett Smith) and Phil (Omar Epps) are going, even though she doesn't like horror films. Phil loves them. I like that Maureen gives her reasons to hate them are valid, African-Americans don't normal survive long and woman aren't portrayed the best either. They both are murdered, which is an interesting look at the horror audience that the theater goers think it is a publicity stunt. They are cheering for the deaths on screen and for the death that is happening before them. It takes them time to realize it is real. Going back to the meta, it is ironic that her fears become true as well.Prank calls are up again for Sydney as well with the film coming out. Her roommate is concerned, Hallie (Elise Neal), that they need to change their number again. When she hears about the murders she seeks out her friend, Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), who is in film class. There are some famous people with him in the class, Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and Joshua Jackson. They are having a debate about the murders and sequels to films.The killer starts to stalk Sydney and there are patterns to the murders that involve the events from the original film. Sydney starts to wonder who it could be. She starts to wonder if it is her new boyfriend, Derek (Jerry O'Connell), or the man she thought killed her mother, Cotton Weary (Live Schreiber). Things don't get easier when Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) and other reporters hounding her. Dewey Riley (David Arquette) is also there to try to help her.This film is interesting in continuing the meta aspect and expanding it to how sequels to films change the rules that the previous film did. As a horror film fan, these are pretty spot on. They normally are bloodier, higher body counts and expand on the story that was set forth in the previous film. We get all of this for the film. There is a reveal that I won't spoil here for those that might not have seen it. I did find this to be a little bit unbelievable though. It was good that Sydney points this out, but I do believe they were on the screen together at one point, so I don't get how it doesn't happen earlier.On the other side though, I love what the reason that the killer was going to use as their excuse. It plays off what the previous film was trying to refute, but it was something that we saw in the news. I think they might have a chance to get away with what they are doing. Personally I disagree with the argument, but the killer doesn't even believe it outside of an excuse. It also is interesting that they want to go to trial for their 20 minutes of fame. This is even more relevant today as I think that is partially the reason for a lot of mass killings we see.The film is paced very well, much like the previous one. The running time is again close to two hours, but it doesn't feel like it. The mystery is also good for this one, even though I didn't care for one of the reveals. For deepening the story of the franchise, I do like it as it adds another dimension. It isn't all that believable that no one would notice who the person was. The other one though was really good. I do like how the film ends as it fitting.Acting for this film I thought was pretty solid, much like the previous film. Campbell I think is great in her role. This adds another dimension to her as she was a survivor from the last film. She doesn't know what to do or who to trust, but she is much stronger in this film. I like what she does for the ending as well, even though her head is messed with for part of it. Neal is fine as the friend. Schreiber is good in his minor role that he has. Kennedy is great again as he is me in my friend's group and I love his knowledge of the genre. It is good to have Cox and Arquette back; their characters have some growth that is good. I also want to shout-out the cameos by Gellar, Olyphant and Jackson.Much like the previous film, the effects look good in this one. They went practical again and it looks real. The knife wounds look like the person was really cut. There are also some gunshots that happen, that aren't covered up too much and actually look like it could have happened. I have to give the film credit for that.This film does lack a little bit from the previous in the score. I do like some of the selections; they bring back one of the songs from the first film that I thought fit very well in this one. I do think that this soundtrack fits the scenes and definitely never hurts it. It just isn't as good.Now with that said, even though this one takes a step back, I think this film is still really good. I'm not the biggest fan of one of the reveals to this film, but I like how it adds to the story. I do think this is a sequel adds on what the previous film did. The pacing as well as the effects of this film is great. The acting is good. Score of the film isn't as good, but I still don't have any issues with it. Overall I'd also say this is a really good film and if you like the first one, definitely give this a viewing. Its meta nature makes it definitely self aware and good for people who are non-fans of the genre.",Scream 2
70,Samiam3,Shame,5,30 June 2009,"Aside from all the great jokes (even better than the first), Scream 2 does nothing else right. It is clear from all the self-reflective comedy that Wes Craven is desperate to show that his series his more than bloody, perverted and gimmicky horror. Ironically, Scream 2 makes the same mistake as every other horror sequel which can be labeled gimmick, it copies the first. Not only is Scream 2 less scary but it is frequently laughable. Watching our killer chasing his shrieking victims wielding the knife resembles a Scooby-Doo chase, totally unscary. Just as it was in the first, the climax is the dumbest part of the film. Not only that, but some of is a direct rip- off of one of the great horror classics, I won't tell you which one, but I'll give you a hint (angry mama). Despite potential, there are no screams to be had here, but if you liked the first, then I guess you will like this one too.",Scream 2

72,slayrrr666,"Just as entertaining as the original, but maybe slightly better",9,4 June 2004,"'Scream 2' is probably the only film in the trilogy that should not have gotten the bad reviews that it received.**SPOILERS**While attending the premiere of the new horror film 'Stab,' a young couple, (Omar Epps and Jada Painkett) are viciously murdered. The film is based on the events of the first 'Scream.' During a year off at college, Sidney (Neve Campbell) is tormenting her roommate, Hallie (Elise Neal) so she seeks out friend Randy (Jaime Kennedy) to shed some light on what happened in the theater. Due to the event, Gale (Courtney Cox) and Dewey (David Arquette) arrive at the school to probe the relationship between what happened. The man who she accused of murdering her mother, Cotton Weary (Live Schrieber) also visits Sidney's college to get the truth from her about him. With Sidney at a party on campus, one of her friends, Cici (Sarah Michelle Geller) is killed. Sidney's boyfriend, Derek (Jerry O'Connell) is quick to dismiss the fact that the killer is after Sidney, but she knows better once she receives the same phone calls as before. He realizes it's true once the killer attacks Sid and Derek in a sorority house. Gale and Dewey begin to realize that a killer is trying to recreate the crimes of the original. Dewey turns to Randy to learn the rules of horror movie sequels. Sidney becomes more and more convinced that the killer is coming after her, but he instead kills one of her friends. Sidney believes that Cotton still is the killer, but the cops don't and release him. She now races to save her friends before the killer finds them and kills them.The Good News: Truly original sequel in the trilogy that never really got the due credits it deserved. Personally, it's my favorite in the trilogy and I think it's better than the first one. The original was great, but part 2 has a certain charm that the first one didn't. The all-star cast isn't it, but I just enjoy watching this one. The gore is slightly toned down, but I don't mind that. It fit the tone of the film. The real reason why I enjoy this one is that the comedy is completely gone to the point of it being not even relevant to the film. As a hard-core horror film fan, I really hated that part about 'Scream' where it took itself too mockingly. It was a film that was being resentful of horror movies while being a horror movie, while maybe being the creative spark that re-ignited horror films, I thought was something that I thought never should've come from Wes Craven, who's made many of the films in my top 20. It was a breath of fresh air for this series, even after the mediocre part 3. The one other good thing for part 2 that the others didn't have was real suspense. Who couldn't forget the nerve-wrecking escape from the cop car? The other cool scene is the school dance, where Sid learns that she is dancing with the killer among a group of similar masked dancers. It could've been played out longer, but it was still really creepy. The other good part of this movie is that I noticed Craven going back to his roots with the movie, showing roving cameras and claustrophobic sets that remind viewers of his earlier masterpieces. The ending is a great example of this. A ten-minute sequence revolving around one place and time that kept you riveted to your seat and tied up loose ends at the same time is a great example of Craven at his best.The Bad News: The killer(s) motive is rather hackneyed and almost unbelievable. Wanting to blame the killings for being inspired by the recent horror film that was itself inspired by the events in the first movie was almost nonsensical and completely moronic. Craven has always been a master of incorporating a great and original premise in his movies, even in his clunker movies. It has been a real trademark in his films, and here he really misses the mark. I know he wanted to compliment on the recent, or at the time recent, controversies involving the violence in horror movies, but it is really tacked on and almost an afterthought. It should've been reworked into a more believable reason for the killer(s). The Final Verdict: This is one of the rare horror film sequels that nearly surpasses the original in popularity, but it deserves to be seen. It is really creepy, the body count is pretty big, and it keeps you riveted, as you never do guess the killer(s) in the film. It is highly recommended to slasher fans and to those who have been turned off of horror because of 'Scream's' success at lampooning their favorite genre.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language",Scream 2
73,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Scream 2""- Despite lacking that lightning-in-a-bottle freshness captured flawlessly by the original, this stellar sequel is another win! A fantastic riff on horror sequels!",9,14 May 2016,"It's odd how some films in retrospect were clearly ahead of their time. While the original ""Scream"" is undeniably a classic of both its time and the horror genre as a whole, it's hard not to notice that its stellar first sequel ""Scream 2"" doesn't command nearly the same level of respect with audiences despite garnering similar critical acclaim. And I do think that in a way, it's because ""Scream 2"" was ahead of its time.How so? It championed and furthered many elements introduced in the original, and fully realizes the potential of some of the elements introduced by its predecessor. Most notable- ""Scream 2"" is one of the most delightfully ""meta"" mainstream films I've seen but it was released about a decade before the whole ""meta"" concept became a ""thing"" that audiences recognized. While today, you can throw a rock and hit something that could be construed (or misconstrued) as ""meta"" not so much back in the 90's. I know a lot of people who saw ""Scream 2"" and its larger focus on meta back in the day as the film just being ""confusing"" or ""sillier"" or ""weird."" Yes, the first film had a lot of meta elements, but it wasn't until this sequel that director Wes Craven and writer Kevin Williamson really went to town and had fun with it. And I think that it went right over a lot of audience's heads when it came out. But especially looking back now, it's easier to see just why this second go is almost as good as the original, and how this stronger focus on self-aware meta storytelling was a great direction to go. Hell, I think it could be argued it even exceeds the original in some ways.The film's opening perfectly establishes this hyper-meta tonality when we start at a public screening of ""Stab""- a movie- within-the-movie, based loosely on the events of the original film. It's at this premier that a new ""Ghostface"" emerges, and takes out a couple film-goers in an opening kill that in my opinion matches the shocking iconic start of the original. Sidney Prescott is now attending college with friend and fellow- survivor Randy, and upon hearing of the new murders, they immediately become suspicious and go on-guard. After being re- united with Dewey and Gale and helping introduce the audience to the newcomer characters, it becomes another fight-for-survival as the new ""Ghostface"" targets our returning heroes, seemingly in an attempt to make a ""real-life sequel"" to the events of the original film.Like the original, the heart of this follow-up is writer Kevin Williamson's wonderful screenplay. As mentioned above, Williamson dives into full-blown ""meta"" territory here, raising the stakes, the laughs and the scares to new level, but always grounded in a self-aware fashion. He also makes the wise choice of giving the returning characters just enough moments of serious character development without bogging down the fast-pacing or feeling out of place. It's one of the most solid scripts for a horror sequel I think has ever been written. And if one pays attention, you can even see Williamson subtly planting the seeds for future sequels and where it may take the story, though done with a sense of class that doesn't just make it feel like sequel-baiting. (It's just a shame the Williamson-less ""Scream 3"" didn't pay off on these concepts) I do believe that on the whole, the writing for this film is cleverer and wittier than the original.Craven of course returns, and just as in the original, his classy sense of visual storytelling and direction helps convey the themes, ideas and of course the gags and scares in expert fashion. With the film going as self-aware as it did, I think that in less capable hands, it could have ventured into cartoonish territory. Thankfully, Craven and his confidence in the material keep it from going there, so it's still a blast of fun and has a good sense of tonal continuity with the original.This film also solidifies that the series cast is just wonderful. Neve Campbell is a revelation in this film and brings more life and pathos to her character. Other returning players such as Jamie Kennedy are a ton of fun. Courtney Cox and David Arquette once again steal the show. And newcomers like Jerry O'Connell and Sarah Michelle Gellar fit right in. The best new addition, however, is definitely Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary, the man Sidney originally suspected of killing her mother before learning this wasn't the case in the original film. Schreiber is a blast as a sort-of sniveling man who is trying to cash-in on his media infamy by forcing Sidney into interviews with him for the news in a hope to gain a bit of fame. It's a very fun part, and Schreiber plays it very well.However, unlike the original... there are some flaws. And they're what's keeping this just shy of getting a perfect 10. And those flaws almost entirely pertain to the script, as despite the level of cleverness and wit displayed by Williamson's writing, it's got some issues. Most notably that it seems Williamson painted himself into a corner more than once, leading to a few awkward scenes where instead of creatively subverting audience expectations like he did in the original... he relied on the horror cliche's and tropes he spent the entire last film lampooning. (A scene inside of a car involving a knocked-out ""Ghostface"" is a prime example.)These moments are just too contrary to the other, much better written scenes to ignore, so I have to knock off a point.However, despite these problems, ""Scream 2"" is another winner. It's furiously entertaining, wickedly creative and simultaneously humorous and horrifying.A near-perfect 9 out of 10, and a fine example of a sequel-done- right!",Scream 2

Fortunately, the satirical elements are just as keen, and thanks in part to the existence of a movie-within-the-movie (""Stab"") based on the initial killings, there's more opportunity for sneaky meta-commentary, particularly from video store geek Kennedy.

In terms of carrying the storyline to everything a good slasher sequel requires? It's a good thing it did. Some find it repetitive but that's just the writer/director respecting the rules. You even have that Randy talk about it. Whom a year later was talking about rules to make a good slasher movie. Not around the same time in the film, but still. It's the first movie on sequel mode. That's all you need to know, this and the fact that it is a lot more fun and filled with late 90s pop culture references. I even suspect SMG's part to be one of them.

Like the original the film is a slasher whodunit as we along the characters try and figure out who it is as it marches towards its thrilling conclusion. Like any great sequel of which there is few it expands the universe and fleshes out the characters even more. There is one emotionally devastating scene concerning Dewey and Gale that may be the best of the series. Craven refreshingly adapts the material bringing new life to the genre. The movie is comedic but also suspenseful, scary and surprising. When the mystery finally unfolds it's not only shocking but so well constructed you can't help but be awed by the complex methodology that went it to it courtesy of its amazing creators master Wes Craven and my idol Kevin Williamson and the strong cast that pull it off. Speaking of performances everything is upped a notch. Neve Campbell is electrifying as Sidney giving her a u pique strength and relatable vulnerability. Courtney Cox really has a journey in this film as Gale and David Arquette is again wonderfully and layered as Dewey. As for the newbies Timothy Olyphant, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf and Liev Schreiber offer solid support. This entry has a bit more to say about the mechanics of the genre and is even a bit more involved than it's predecessor but the sheer magnetism of the first is never fully met.

I'm guessing the parts I missed, as well as the ending, were just like any other Scream movies. I actually really enjoy watching them. The characters are all relatable and fun to discover. The scary parts are not scary, but the guessing of who the killer is happens to be the fun part. In fact, I might just finish the film after all.The movie takes place after the first film. A movie had been made about the killings from Scream, and on the premiere date, a couple is murdered. It appears there's another masked serial murderer on the lose. Characters come and go, and get knifed up. Etc. etc.I thought it was okay. Nothing really new. I was surprised to see a lot of celebrities doing cameos. I forgot how big the Scream movies were when they originally came out.4 stars",Scream 2
79,Screen_Blitz,Clever follow-up to Wes Craven's horror franchise,7,14 September 2015,"Wes Craven gained respect of horror fans with his 1996 hit slasher hit Scream, a film that reignited the slasher-horror genre with its originality and self-awareness. The following year, Craven continued the story of the masked killer with this entertaining sequel that continues the story. Neve Campbell reprises her role as Sidney Prescott who is now in college, and is dating a handsome heartthrob named Derek (played by Jerry O'Connell). Jamie Kennedy also reprises his role as Randy Meeks, the film-geek who's remained friends with Sidney after the events from the first movie. This film follows a copycat killer that is on the loose and taking the lives of others on college campus. Sidney must team up with her boyfriend Derek, and Randy, along with Gale and Dewey who also make their return from the first film, to survive against the killer's onslaught.As this film is a sequel, there are quite a bit discussions between characters about sequels and what they are all about. Like this film, these characters are very self-aware of the strategies of surviving against a killer in a horror movie, and the script makes very clear. While this one may not level up the previous film, it still remains as original and thoughtful as the previous film came out to be. It still contains the scares, suspense, and bloodshed by the Ghostface killer, and the wittiness of writer Kevin Williamson's script. It also pays a good homage to classic low-budget slasher horror films from the 80s like Splatter University, Slaughter High, and and Graduation Day. Liev Schreiber makes an interesting appearance as Cotton Weary who was the accused suspect of Sidney's mom's murder in the last, and is released from prison after proved not guilty. Neve Campbell remains good as ever as Sidney, and the rest of the cast including Jamie Kennedy, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, and Elise Neal are great as well. Could this movie have done better? Sure. But overall, this movie did not dissappoint me. This movie is one of the few horror movie sequels that manages to level relatively close with its original, and shows while Wes Craven is such an amazing horror director.",Scream 2
80,Sirus_the_Virus,"Not quite as good, but a worthy entry.",8,8 September 2009,"Scream 2 is a sequel that I didn't quite like as much but still really liked it. I appreciate the Scream films for a few reasons. I like how it makes fun of some other horror films. Also, at first, you'll find it pretty scary. Also, I thought the films were pretty original and they have a few laughs. But the problem I had with the films, which really isn't a problem, is that after you've seen them a few times, you know what's going to happen. I don't blame the film, I blame myself. Because I have seen the Scream films many times. I think that the Scream trilogy is funny and fun to watch. Scream 2 is even bloodier than the first film, I think. Not that the first film wasn't bloody. In the first film, you saw two people get their insides put on the outside. Cut out of course. I didn't quite like Scream 2 as much as the original, but it's still just a fun and intriguing. I give Scream 2 a pretty big thumbs up.Scream 2: ***1/2 out of ****",Scream 2
81,baumer,"Furthers the series nicely, but.....",7,13 November 2000,"Warning, may contain some spoilers.The problem with most horror films now a days is that they are vacuous. There is a notion from a great many aspiring film makers that they can break into the business the same way that perhaps Carpenter and Moustapha Akkad did.  Carpenter, as we all know, made the legendary Halloween and Moustapha Akkad financed it for him.  That film broke all sorts of barriers and not only was it a good film, but it scared people.  In the early 90's, you had an apathetic audience without a modicum of desire to see horror films.  The genre had run its course with so many ersatz so called horror films, that no one gave any credit to even the good ones that were released.  But that all changed in 1996 when Wes Craven was smart enough to take a brilliant script by Kevin Williamson and turn it into something that all horror fans and movie fans could appreciate.  Scream became something of a legend.  This was a film that ostracized all of the banal efforts from the last decade and justified the horror film once again.  This was a film that respected the greats from the past like Halloween and Nightmare On Elm Street and Friday the 13th.  It gave a rebirth to a stale genre and made it fresh.  I, for one was thrilled with Scream and even though there are now a slew of inferior horror films launched into mainstream, every once in a while you get films like Blair Witch, Sixth Sense, Stir of Echoes and Final Destination.  These films make it easier to stomach all of the Urban Legends and I Know What You Did Last Summers and so on.  Scream 2 carries on the story from Scream and it sets us up for the final installment.Is Scream 2 any good?  Your damn right it is.  But it is not quite as good as Scream is.  But that is okay.  Halloween 2 was great but not as good as the first and the only Nightmare that was nearly as good as the first was the last one.  So as sequels go, this is a very fine one. 
Sydney is now attending college with her pal Randy.  She is hoping that all the fuss from her Woodsborough days are over but there is now a film being released that is based on the murders ( and in a great tongue in cheek moment, Tori Spelling plays Sid in the movie Stab ).  So there is now media attention once again hurled her way.  Then at a local screening of Stab, two of Sid's college cronies are murdered thus lending credibility to theory that it is starting all over again.  Soon Gale shows up and then Dewey. Gale shows her face for the media attention and Dewey is there to protect her.  So we now have all the major principals in place. 
Soon, people begin to die and we now have a full fledged psychopathic killer on the loose again with an ominous sounding voice.  As Randy alludes to almost coyly, too coyly for it not to mean something, Scream 2 doesn't really solve anything.  Sure it is revealed that the killer happens to be Billy Loomis' mom and she has her own reasons for wanting Sid dead, but just as in Empire Strikes Back, there is always room for more story.  The ending of this film offered a conclusion, but there just seems to be something still lurking beneath the surface.  And this is where I have my theories. Bear with me here.Randy says that Empire wasn't really a true sequel, that it was a planned part of a trilogy and that is obviously true of Scream.  Kevin Williamson may have started out with just a really neat idea about a horror film that parodies other horror films, but by the time he reached the second film, he knew there was enough material here to make three films, and in my mind, it will be four.  You see, I don't think the killer is really caught.  In Scream it was Stu and Billy, in this one it is Mrs. Loomis and in the third one it is, anyway, you get the picture.  But at the end of Scream 3, there is that feel to it that tells you that something further could happen.  Even at the end of Friday the 13th, the final chapter, Tommy's eyes are all bugged out and the producers were basically telling you that this was not the last installment.  And in Scream 2, I think there are real clues as to who the real killer is.  When Randy is killed, we almost all but forget his conversation with Dewey about them both possibly being suspects.  Because with him gone, he is obviously not a suspect anymore, but why not Dewey?  Especially in this film, he is always around when the killings happen, and as he said about Derek when he was slashed on the wrist, he himself always just happens to get hurt but not fatally.  There are also shots of him in this film and in the first one wearing the same type of boots that the killer does.  To me, just like in Star Wars, there has to be a fourth one.  The script is all but jumping out at us and how many films have just stopped after making 4 films? Scream could make history by doing so.  There are just way to many possibilities and none of the doors have been shut on Dewey being the killer.  Anyway, back to the film itself.  It does a nice job of furthering the story and Randy and his film class have some nice moments when they discuss movies and their sequels.  This film also does a nice job of famous cameos.  Joshua Jackson, Rebecca Gayhart, Portia DeRossi and Sara Michelle Gellar have small but fun roles in the film.  Actually the cast is well assembled in the film.Overall, Scream 2 is not quite as good as Scream but that would have been impossible anyway.  It is however, a good film and it does plenty to set up Scream 3.  This is a good second installment to the famous trilogy. 
8 out 10- Looking forward to the 4th one, if they can get the principals to come back....",Scream 2
82,DunnDeeDaGreat,Very good sequel,9,19 November 2001,Scream 2 did what most horror films can't which is live up to the original. Neve Campbell is good as always and even my boy Randy becomes the pimp s*** in this movie. I love all the pop cutlure references and film references. Because of that the film gets **** out of ****.,Scream 2
83,suite92,Gale from Scream writes a book that becomes a movie; the well of revenge is not empty yet.,7,11 November 2013,"Since the happenings of the previous film, Gale wrote a book, The Woodsboro Murders, which becomes a movie called Stab.We follow a black couple into a showing of the film, which reminds me of showings of Rocky Horror Picture Show that I've experienced. The audience is largely costumed, the theatre operates some props, and the audience brings some 'required' stuff. The couple get knifed to death, separately, which establishes the context of the rest of the picture.So, we're in the self-referential environment of Scream, but with the passage of time, and an evolution in the setting.The film class discussion of original movies versus sequels went on too long. Like Scream, this is just over the top self-regarding nonsense, with too much discussion of particular movies within another movie.Gale arranges a meeting between Cotton and Sidney, without telling Sidney. Even Cotton thought that was a bit much. Sidney hits Gale again, during filming. Dewey is displeased with Gale for her characterization of him in her book as Barney Fife. Ish.Sidney might pledge at Delta Lambda Zeta, so we have another mini-universe of clichés to exploit. Cici is at the Omega Beta Zeta house, and becomes the next victim in the cycle. Back at the mixer, Portia di Rossi's eyebrows were hideous. The attention quickly shifts from the mixer to Cici's death and the swarming of cops and reporters.The costumed assailant attacks Sidney in the DLZ house after the crowd has left. Derek gets stabbed, but far from fatally. The next morning, there is a lot of assessment and not enough facts. Dewey, the Sheriff, and Gale notice a pattern in the names of the new victims versus the principals in the earlier case.Sidney gets invited by Gus Gold to play Cassandra. The costumes in the play are more than a bit reminiscent of the murderer's Halloween get up. Also, they have knives, so this was not such a great idea.Randy gets killed in Gale's van while it's on the quad; Sidney gets a death threat in the library. Goodness. Cotton has a talk with Sidney in the school library; she wants to leave, he won't have it; he starts yelling like everything while still in the library. The cops take him in for an alternate discussion.Dewey and Gale pore over footage from recent crime scenes, looking for the culprit. That worked out fairly well for the killer. Dewey has a more than rough spot; the killer rushes off to go after Sidney and Hallie.The picture wraps up hard and fast after that.----Scores-----Cinematography: 10/10 Good-looking picture.Sound: 10/10 Fine, no problems.Acting: 7/10 Not as good as the original. Liev Schreiber was an improvement over Matthew Lillard, but he did not make up for the presence of Pinkett-Smith or Jerry O'Connell. Sarah Michelle Gellar was a plus in her short performance, but Tori Spelling was the gaping black hole of non-acting one expects.Screenplay: 6/10 The endless references to clichés in other films drags this down a bit. Some of the acting is sufficient to carry the story forward.",Scream 2
84,Fernando-Rodrigues,Meh...,7,21 September 2020,"It has some conveniences too (like Phil's death: the killer could not see him, so how the knife got perfectly on the spot where his ear was?).. The killers here weren't so obvious, but yet, meh.. that was so sequel thing, Billy's mother avenging his kid and Mickey helping.. This movie could've been shorter as well.",Scream 2
85,Stampsfightclub,Lacks the screams but still a highly enjoyable thriller,8,20 August 2009,"Sidney Prescott (Campbell) is traumatized when a film of her deadly experiences is released, and soon a killer replicating the movie starts killing her friends.In the sequel to the hugely popular Scream comes an equally enjoyable horror flick that presents mystery and intrigue right up until the well choreographed if slightly exaggerated climax.The characters who were not assassinated in the first film return with a bang in this picture, most notably Neve Campbell's Sidney who is trying to move on after her gruesome showdown with her boyfriend and psycho partner 2 years previously. But a gruesome murder spree at a local cinema at a screening of 'Stab' soon has suspicions raised as once more the Ghost mask is present.This now infamous murderer starts handpicking victims one by one and the way this story is told, there is no apparent reason and pattern to these killings, which generates a wonderful sense of mystery. In a sense this sequel is like a good crime novel. An obvious target, a couple of red herrings, gruesome murders and a gasping realization come the final part. In a way it's a shame to find out the identity of said killer as the mystery and unfathomable story is so well told you almost don't want to know. Sadly however every film has an end and with this comes a shocking realization and exciting final battle.Neve Campbell once more excels as the lead, being quietly aggressive and opinionated without being too squeamish in her paranoia. David Arquette receives a more inquisitive role in this sequel which takes into account his more vulnerable personality as Dewy with Courtney Cox as great and present as the annoying reporter.Wes Craven's approach to this sequel is, as Randy so eloquently puts it, have more deaths which are more elaborate and gory as the film's predecessor. Initially this statement seems to be tried and tested trivia but when the film gets into the latter stages we see the point as the deaths get hotter and heavier as the pace rounds to tension.With Scream the surprise and shock of the murderer kept the tempo at razor edge as clues and hints mislead us right until the jaw dropping finale, not to forget that there were a few jumpy moments in and amongst the gripping chases. With this sequel there are very few jump scenes and the conceptual genre of horror is left purely down to the gruesome killings. In a sense this is a more adept movie concentrating on the story rather than going for full out jumps. Whether you like jumping behind the sofa or be engaged physiologically remains irrelevant once the pace starts. There are nervous scenes but this doesn't generate the fear factor you may want from a horror film.Is this better than the original? No, purely because the first hit was so surprising and had the jumps and the tension, it made a complete horror. Do not be discouraged as where this may lack the freak-out factor; it is fast and highly enjoyable.",Scream 2
86,CharltonBoy,The same as the original?,6,23 July 1999,"scream 2 is very very much like the original which i suppose is what they were trying to do, to carry on from the first movie's success. Without giving anything away the people who get killed and the people who do the killing are very predictable as is the whole movie.It was not that bad though , i just hope they dont make a scream 3 because they have just about exhausted the story line. 6 out of 10",Scream 2
87,gbheron,"Don't Watch w/o Seeing ""Scream"" First",7,11 February 2001,"""Scream"" reinvigorated the slasher movie, a narrow genre to begin with, and one that I thought exhausted.  It's sequel, ""Scream 2"" is very similar to its predecessor in substance and style. Strong character development, clever dialogue, large dollops of humor, and of course lots of scares marks this as way above average. Unfortunately, ""Scream 2"" has two significant difficulties for viewers. One is that it's almost a mirror image of ""Scream"". Instead of high school, it's set at a college, but the characters, and set-ups are almost identical. You don't have to see both movies, one is enough. The second problem is that if you haven't seen ""Scream"", ""Scream 2"" won't make a lot of sense. The plot follows the survivors of ""Scream"" to college, where, of course, the carnage begins anew. There are tons of backwards references that don't stand-alone very well, and as for the who-dunnit aspects of the movie's conclusion, knowledge of the original ""Scream"" is an absolute necessity.  Therefore, only rent ""Scream 2"" if you've also seen ""Scream"" and want more of the same. It's exactly what you'll get.",Scream 2
88,stamper,A Classic's sequel,7,18 June 2000,"Well this in a way is a typical sequel and in a way it is not. You have all the original cast here which is I must say a must in a sequel. You really shouldn't do that kind of stuff they did in for instance Chucky or so, keep the cast if the names are the same, all else is bull and most of the audience won't like it. Also don't change a good formula!!!! (this goes out to them suckers who want to make Scream 4 without the original cast (or even dare to think about it)). If you want to do it do it with them or NOT and if you do, please Neve, Courteney, David and Wes only when the script is great, no ONLY when it RULES and do not do it for money when your career is in a dip like van Damme did with Universal Sodier 2. I mean look at lousy horror sequels: Hellraiser 2 and 4, Chucky 3, Nightmare on Elm Street 5 and A new Nightmare (sorry Wes).This is I must admit not the second time I watched this one, for I was preparing to see Scream 3 really soon afterwards, so I wanted to see Scream 1 and Scream 2 before, so I could get back in to everything that happened. I already knew, of course, who the killer was and this review (as to the whodunnit) looks at the film as if I first saw it.Another good thing here is that all the cast looks grown up, I mean between Scream and Scream 2 there is only one year, but you feel as if many years have gone by (just as the story suggests). This is especially extreme with Neve Campbell, who in Scream looked like 15 or 16 and here looks like 19 or so. I must also say, that the new looks of Campbell and Courteney Cox are much better (they look good, with those clothes and different hair, yummy!!!!). There are yet some other pretty ladies running about, what about that Sarah Michelle Gellar and Sid's on screen friend played by Elise Neil. Of course you can see also Portia DeRossi also, who is if I may say is pretty too (normally), but here is just a non - ugly (along with all her sorority sisters) female. I must say though she plays one genuine bleached blonde bim.. (you fill out the rest) here. Also there was of course the shagadelic Heather Graham, who played in the movie Stab' but who had a real bad wig there in the movie within the movie. But she was not as pretty either here.This one may be not as original as the first one, but it still is funny, exciting, surprising (you never know who is/are the killer(s)) and well acted. For the psycho killer(s) I must say he/she/they was/were great, you really believed he/she /they were totally flipped and you bought it. Neve Campbell really has grown in acting and is yet much more believable and so are David Arquette and Courteney Cox, whose characters are deepened out.NOW I want to spend a few lines on the great Neve Campbell, I thought she will be great (as in a successful actress) when I saw The Craft, Scream, Scream 2, but I must revise this now, she chooses to stay and make low budget films, that are not so heavily supported by the studios and so tend to make little money. But I must say that it is a good choice as long as the movies are as good as Wild Things or Simba's Pride.The best thing here though is the direction, Wes Craven made this one much more theatrical than the first one, and there are two scenes I LUV especially, the opening scene and the rehearsal scene. They are great and combine effects, music and events perfectly. Also there are some great spoofs. Now I bet you wonder why this does not get a 10, I presume, well I felt that some things should not have been done in the film, like that scene when Cox and Arquette go see some footage. Also I didn't like the new camera dude that much, played by Duane Martin, for I thought his frightened' character was too overdone. Also I found the ending not very good, it was mere average. The end of Scream was much and much better, so it come that this film does not get a 10.Still: rent, watch and enjoy8 out of 10",Scream 2
89,ivo-cobra8,Flawles but yet enjoyable horror slasher sequel flick,10,18 February 2018,"Scream 2 is flawless but enjoyable sequel it is not better than the first one but much way better than part 4. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson does return for this sequel but still I enjoy the third one much way more. The second sequel was good little different mixed with action and humor, but it wasn't that scary to me. It is really a step down from the first film. I have a lot of problems with this film. The bad: The writer Kevin Williamson copied the first film why would they copy the first film? I don't get it. The film looks like the same as the first movie, first the name of the town was Windsor like in the first movie Woodsboro: Then the victims were killed whit the same names and surnames the same emo from the first killer. Than was a copy killer on the loose and than they were like two killers just one wants to get away, the other wants to get caught. Deputy Sheriff David Arquette as Dewey Riley did do nothing in this movie and he was useless in this film! He was complaining, yelling and did do nothing, he was slashed but yet again he survived, how did he survive? or why is he in this movie is yet beyond me. Kevin Williamson wrote his character dull and awful. Marco Beltrami copied and stole the theme music score from Hans Zimmer music score for Broken Arrow (1996) John Woo film. The humor I didn't like in here and I didn't like they were talking about Stab fictional movie in this film that was based on Scream film. Jada Pinkett Smith was in the beginning in this film and she was terrible. Most of the characters in this film are awful. The good: I love the ghostface killer in this movie and he doesn't use so much scary movies questions like in the first movie, he simply kills fast his victims. I love Neve Campbell as Sidney Prescott she was lovely, such a sole survivor, such a bad-ass even more sexy than in the first film. Her ass was sexy, man o man she was hot! I fall in love with her, I did enjoy her performance as Sidney. I enjoy Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers this time she had a different hair cut but she was still good in her performance as a nosy tabloid reporter. The most hero I enjoy in this movie is Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary he is awesome!!! A true real hero he is excellent! I really did enjoy the plot twist and his character. Sarah Michelle Gellar as Casey ""Cici"" Cooper is in here she is really good and Timothy Olyphant as Mickey from Live Free or Die Hard is in here! The cast work really well. 8/10 It is a good slasher horror movie and a good sequel to the first one I still watch this films, I like this film and the trilogy. I like the song ""She Said by Collective Soul excellent song. My third favorite film in the series but still a good one, doesn't deserve the hate.",Scream 2
90,fernandoschiavi,"The sequel is also the darkest movie of all, critically questioning the consequences of horror and popularizing a myth (apparently) unintentionally",7,24 July 2021,"It's been two years and the murders in Woodsboro have been translated onto the movie screen. Gale Wheaters (Courtney Cox) managed to achieve the media positioning she wanted and is the author of The Killers of Woodsboro book, transported to film as The Stab. Sidney Prescott is now a sad and lonely college student (Neve Campbell), but she will need to reinvent herself: the media is on her trail due to the movie theater murders, mainly because the murdered girl is named Maureen Evans (Jada Pinket Smith, who by the way, stars in an excellent opening scene), the same name as his mother. To make matters worse, Cotton Weaver (Liev Schrieber) is on the loose, participates in media programs and wants to make his innocence an advertising theme. Dewey (David Arquette), upon being informed of the crimes, sets off to meet Sidney. He, Gale, Sidney and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) must fight for survival.The prologue to Scream 2 is promising: it is set in the popular debut of the film inspired by the events of Scream (1996), or rather, based on the series of murders that took place in the small town of Woodboro, California. In line for the session, a black couple discuss racial inequality in horror cinema just before being brutally murdered by a new Ghostface. The sequence ends with one of the victims agonizing between the screen and the darkroom audience - where many are costumed as the masked killer. The ironic, self-referential and very symbolic introduction makes clear everything that will come next, a sharp and refined sequence that owes nothing to its original. In addition to aiming his gaze at himself, Scream 2 directs his perspective towards his viewers, their expectations and frustrations with genre cinema. Williamson has composed his script with so many layers - from satire to parody, through social and intellectual criticism - in a narrative that is fun and uneconomical in blood or suspense.Williamson's script doesn't have the same originality as the first one, but he manages to address and satirize many issues involving the genre. If in the first film, the focus was around the clichés and convenient situations of the genre, in the second the focus is on the question: ""Could a sequel be better than the original?"". In one of the most interesting scenes of the direction, Randy is discussing this same question with the other students in film class. The fan-loved character claims that no sequel is better than the original even with other students citing such successful sequels as ""Terminator 2"", ""Aliens"" and ""The Godfather - Part 2"" (film which Randy claims to be "" An exception among Oscar winners""). The truth is that there is no shortage of examples of good and bad sequels. And the main success of the script for ""Scream 2"" is knowing how to handle it in an exceptional way. Other discussions are addressed, such as whether violence in a movie can influence someone in real life, but none is as well explored as the one mentioned above. The script also plays with the famous rules of horror movie sequences, according to Randy they are: the number of deaths is always higher than in the first film, the death scenes are much more elaborate and with more blood, the survivors from the original massacre are the prime targets of the new assassin and it should never be assumed that the assassin is dead. Another tip would be said by Randy, but he was interrupted by Dewey.Kevin Williamson also tried to include in the script a few more interesting characters: Hallie (Elise Neal), Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and Derek (Jerry O'Connel), Sidney's new boyfriend. Marco Beltrami returns to sign the sound work, along with editor Patrick Lussier, a professional who accompanied Wes Craven during the films of the saga. Who also returns and prints a student atmosphere, but stylized, is the director of photography Peter Deming. The scenic space, the depth of field (especially in the scenes in more closed places) and the creative role of the camera are the important technical highlights for conducting this very dynamic narrative.Scream 2 relies on the hooks left by the first film to elaborate its plot. The metalanguage exercise remains intact, since this sequence uses the rules imposed by its gender, in order to create something new, in other words, original. While in the first film, the killer brought his fascination for horror movies when elaborating the murders, in Scream 2, the ""Ghostface"" attacks again, but here he intends to continue what was left by the killer(s) of the previous film, therefore, the deaths here are premeditated according to the gaps that were left by the events of the first feature.Sociologically speaking, this second chapter explores very hard-hitting issues in relation to the media and television news that squeeze blood into daily programs. We know there is a need for information, but violence has become even more a spectacle these days, and the director and screenwriter, as if they were predicting the future, bet on addressing this trivialization of violence. Gale plays this role very well and the dialogues with his new cameraman border on sensational. Sarcastic, ironic and shameless: all the reporter initially wants is to be awarded and to get her ""scoops"" in her reports.Wes Craven gets the steering right again, managing to create tense and thought-provoking scenes, such as the scene of the phone calls in the park or the murder scene that takes place in the Omega Beta Zeta brotherhood. But the scene Craven's direction hits the hardest is where Dewey and Gale are trying to figure out who the killer is by filming Gale's cameraman, Joel, in a large, completely empty space. The tension in this sequence is capable of leaving many viewers glued to their seats, appearing among one of the best scenes in the entire franchise. The opening scene, while inferior to the original, is also striking and well thought out without a repeat of horror movie trivia or killer mind games.The director reframes the common codes of sequences in a direction that proves best when stripped of affectation or exaggeration. It's in economics that the filmmaker excels: its climax has all the grandeur of a Greek tragedy, but it's sequences like the one with Sidney and her friend in the police car that impress. The time Craven devotes to building the suspense is meticulously planned, which guarantees a better result when your intention is to shock with the excess of blood and viscera or electrify in moments of cat-and-mouse chase, or more directly, Ghostface and its victims. Marco Beltrami's soundtrack is highlighted once again, but here it fights for prominence with other pieces created by Hans Zimmer and Danny Elman.This time, the characters gain further development and the spectator cares about many of them, great merit of which goes to their performance. Neve Campbell is performing even better than the first movie delivering a Sidney who is strong but also terrified of her enemy's return. In one of the best scenes of the movie Sidney is doing a play where she plays the figure of Greek mythology Cassandra and Craven plays very well with the paranoia that the character feels every second. The actress demonstrates a versatility for impressive drama and suspense, unfortunately unexplored in the upcoming two installments of the franchise. This time around, Courteney Cox's indiscreet reporter and David Arquette's blind detective gain more prominence and better dialogue, which overwhelm the rest of the cast destined to undeveloped characters and closer to the archetypes that the film itself tries to subvert.Williamson's script ends up failing in parts, where the characters end up making unwise decisions and choosing the worst places to hide. The assassin's revelation was not surprising either, it may be something already expected by some, with the motive of the killing not being so well developed. The pair of assassins and their reasons are the most preposterous and improbable, but efficient in the mythology of the film when considering the debauchery to which the Scream saga is disposed. Mrs. Loomis even has a convincing motive. Revenge, after all, Sidney killed his son, but Mickey's is pretty clueless. In fact, she doesn't even have a real motive.However, the second film's biggest flaw lies in the fact that it was architected in a year, and with that, inevitably, some edges remained meaningless, limiting the capabilities that this sequel could reach. Certain characters are little explored by the film, and, unlike the first one, here they seem out of place in terms of their position in the events. To quote, the identity of a certain character as the ""Ghostface"" seemed completely blurred, serving more as a scheme programmed by the script to adhere to some function of the subject. Due to this flaw, and other mistakes in its narrative rhythm (which sometimes becomes monotonous, something that did not happen in the first one), Scream 2 becomes a smaller shadow of its predecessor. But, although this happens, what we have here is still a delicious work to be followed, which also earns points for managing not to spoil the merits conquered by its predecessor (something very common in sequels). The sequel to the original is also the darkest movie of all, critically questioning the consequences of horror and popularizing a myth (apparently) unintentionally. This is an achievement of the beautiful partnership between Williamson and Craven, something that resulted in a franchise that, even if today is not so appreciated for its cinematographic attributes, is certainly loved by the brand that has carved out a generation.",Scream 2
91,jackDee-56565,A acceptable sequel and its enjoyable,7,6 September 2020,Scream 2 is a good movie though it did not live up to the first for me it was too comedic at times but I still really liked but nothing near the awesomeness of scream,Scream 2
92,TheNorthernMonkee,"entertaining, but forced",6,9 August 2005,"SPOILERS One year after 'Scream' gave life to a dying genre, this entertaining but incredibly forced sequel was released. Continuing the story with the old survivors plus new casualties, 'Scream 2' is a fun affair, without ever actually returning to the highs of the original. Blatantly attempting to resurrect the glory imposed on the first outing, it manages to remain immensely predictable for the majority before hitting you with an exquisite twist at the end.Two years later and Sidney Prescott's (Neve Campbell) life appears to be back on track. Happily settled at college, she still gets the occasional prank call, but will happily laugh it off thanks to caller ID. Yes, with a new 'perfect' boyfriend and life sorted, for Sidney life can only go wrong. So let's not be surprised when suddenly a copycat killer begins to replicate the events of the past.Yet again the amazing Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson present us with the life of Sidney Prescott. With bad acting and some weak lines, you do know what your going to get with these films, and in regards to blood, you are rarely surprised. Ultimately though, the film is lacking. Less intellectual than it's predecessor, you only begin to grasp the genius at work when the eccentric film buffs class is taking place and every man and his dog pokes fun at the regularly inferior 'sequel'. This in itself is a brilliant masterstroke by writer Williamson who is blatantly aware of how this film will fail to live up to the original. Williamson is in fact so definite on this fact, that he abandons the intelligence soon after this early scene and resorts to jokes about the cast ('Friends' jokes for Courtney Cox, references to the cast of the film 'Stab' which is being made as a tribute to the original film) and the surprise twist at the end. Aside from these though, Williamson's input is limited and lacking in comparison with what he achieve in the first film.The other problem of course is the same reason why so many sequels fail to live up to their predecessor, mainly that they are not original. 'Scream' changed horror and it did it in a fresh and keen way. In contrast 'Scream 2' is just another entry into the curriculum vitae of the cast and nothing new. Yes the plot is new and yes we do have new characters, but the feelings you get from watching a ground breaking film are absent. The film in effect, is like the first film but without the relevance.'Scream 2' is not a bad film to watch. Often entertaining, albeit in a predictable way, it does provide a few key moments. That's all that can really be said about it however. Once again the acting is weak, and once again you don't care because most of the characters will die. The film is basically a repeat of it's predecessor but without the charm, intelligence and original feel. Watch it and be amused, but don't expect too much. Your average teenage horror story.",Scream 2
93,swilliky,Sequel is not the original,5,14 August 2016,"The slasher sequel takes on the horror tropes of sequels and revisits the plight of Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who is now in college. Many of the survivors return including Randy (Jamie Kennedy), Dewey Riley (David Arquette), and reporter turned best-selling author Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) and a new killer is on the loose targeting students connected to Sydney. New characters are added to the victim or suspect list including Hallie (Elise Neal), Cici (Sara Michelle Gellar), Mickey (Timothy Olyphant), and Sydney's boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell). A movie was made within the movie making this sequel even extra meta. There is even more horror movie talk as the bodies start to pile up starting with a couple in a movie theater, Phil (Omar Epps) and Maureen (Jada Pinkett Smith). The sequel does not hold back on the gore with plenty of killing as director Wes Craven both chides and embraces an audience that continuously shows up to view these brutal murders.The mystery is even more complex as potential suspects appear including Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) cameraman Joel (Duane Martin), and the exonerated former suspect of Sydney's mom's murder Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber). The movie pays homage to the original while at the same time referencing plenty of other horror movies sequels as inspiration while also taking on the challenge of making a sequel that is better than the original.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Scream 2
94,gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"While lacking the spark of the original, Scream 2 still feels worthy enough as a continuation of the franchise",8,30 October 2019,"After the success of the original, the sequel entered development as quickly as possible. A year later, Scream 2 came out in theaters and turned a profit despite competition with James Cameron's blockbuster Titanic and while not as well received as the original, it's considered by many to be one of the best horror sequels as time went by.A lot of time had passed since the events of Woodsboro, California, but a killer is on the loose once again only this time at a college in Ohio. Sidney, Randy, Dewey and the other college students including Cotton played by Liev Schreiber are being attacked and they must find out who the actual killer is before they'll end up being killed.Scream 2 managed to be quite as good as the first although the original is still the best. However, before I can give this some praise there are some problems that brought the film down. First of all, the story is hit and miss. On a positive note, it does a nice job expanding on certain aspects of the first including having Billy Loomis's mother appear and it still managed to have some funny comedy and some scary chills that the original film offered. Also I like it's social commentary on sequels. Unfortunately, everything else is just a retread of the original with the killer reveal being not as fresh this time around. Even the pacing's not that good. Don't get me wrong. I liked the beginning and the climax of the film despite being somewhat predictable and cliched as it does bring some intensity when Sidney fights against Billy Loomis's mother and Mickey. Unfortunately, it's not very brisk enough and kind of dragged the film for a while.That being said, everything else is still good. The acting, much like the original, is very good from all involved as Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, and others including Liev Schreiber, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Laurie Metcalf, Jada Pinkett Smith give some very good performances as well. The characters are still likeable and even the new additions despite having limited screen time are still interesting enough. The direction is really neat, the cinematography is well spent and Marco Beltrami's score, much like the original, suited the atmosphere, suspense, and tone really well.Overall, while Scream 2 lacks the spark and retreads the first film, it's still a worthy enough sequel. Check it out and you won't regret it.",Scream 2

The one thing I enjoy about the Scream movies is that, the killer can actually get hurt. In most slasher films, you can't even scratch the killer without him stabbing you, or cutting of your head. In the Scream movies the killer will get hurt if you hit him. He will fall if you push him. He will hurt if you cut him. At least these movies are realistic. I mostly enjoy all of the Scream movies, this one wasn't perfect, but I still enjoy it. The film is very good, but not perfect. I still enjoy this film, even if there are some things about it that I don't like. I'm going to watch ""Scream 3"" today, so I hope I enjoy it like I enjoy most of the Screams.

96,Jack the Ripper1888,ungh!,8,14 April 2002,"If you thought SCREAM was bad, then you will be even more disappointed with SCREAM 2. This movie is even worse. Collage grads and survivors from the first movie are now in college (and how coincidentally that both of the two teen survivors both ended up going to the same college) when yet another knife wailing maniac begins killing off people on campus. So...that isn't very original. It is pretty much just the first movie's script rewritten (only dumber). When we learn the identities of the killers, we think ""Oh yeah"". But, they are both people who were underdeveloped. For one of the killers, we never really get to understand his motive, but hey. The other killer *POSSIBLE SPOILER* turns out to be one of those people who was secretly involved with the first movie. But, in this movie, we don't know about that until the very end. Which makes it just look like writer Kevin Williamson just made up that tie-in motive because he couldn't think of a better one. He too, obviously had no idea who he was going to make the killers out to be until he got to the part of the movie where the killers are supposed to be revealed. And that really isn't that good of a plan. Especially if you are writing a sequel. The main goal of a sequel is to surpass its predecessor. This sequel doesn't do that. Not in the least. The most exciting part of the movie would probably be the end credits with the song ""I think I love you"" playing by Less Than Jake. I'm gonna give this un-defying horror movie 2/5 just because the end credits were better than the first film's.",Scream 2
97,deatman9,A good sequel.,6,17 October 2012,This movie was good but I don't think it was as good as the first one. The creepy atmosphere is lost in this one. Though the acting is pretty good and there are some pretty intense moments.This movie follows Sidney Prescott two years after the she escapes the murderous boyfriend in the first one. Someone has dawned the ghost face costume and is trying to copycat the killers murders. Sidney is once again the main target of the ghost face fury.This movie was not bad at all. It just was not scary at all compared to the first one. I also found I did not care about the characters as much so when They dies it made no difference.,Scream 2

This sequel is somewhat funnier and arguably more clever than the original, but it is just as annoying, and the characters seem to be even more stupid than in the first.  Here's hoping that the survivors of part two all die a quick and painful death in part three.  After all, these characters have been trying their hardest to die in the first two ""Scream"" movies, and have only been unsuccessful because the killers have been even more dense than the potential victims.  Killing the leads would redeem the whole series.",Scream 2

100,Geeky Randy,"Wow! This Is The First Time Geeky Randy Meeks Has EVER Been Wrong! Not ALL ""Sequels Suck!""",10,17 February 2001,"Two years after the Woodsboro Murders, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) leaves home to major in acting at Windsor College. Everything is great now.  Her horrible past is behind her.  She has a lead role in a play, is making great friends, and even has a sane boyfriend, Derek (Jerry O'Connell). When everything seems to be going great, two students that attend the same college as Sidney, are brutally murdered by a psychopath in a Father's Death Costume.  Sound familiar?  Yes.  Copycat killer. This copycat killer chooses his/her victims in the order that a victim was killed in Woodsboro.  Similarities of the victims in Woodsboro and Windor are the names.  Maureen Prescott - Maureen Evans.  Steven Orth - Phil Stevens.  You get the picture. The killer wants revenge.  But who is the killer?  And what did Sidney ever do to drive somebody on a killing spree?  If the killer is following Woodsboro, the killer must be from Woodsboro.  But who could it be?Could it be one of Sidney's new friends?  They seem fine, but you never know.  One of them might be from Woodsboro.  Or maybe it's somebody in Woodsboro that she already knows.  A fellow survivor of the Woodsboro Murders?  Dwight `Dewey' Riley (David Arquette), Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), and Geeky Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy).  Why would they want to kill her?  Dewey's sister died trying to help Sidney in the terrifying Woodsboro Muders, maybe Dewey blames Sidney for his sister's death.  Gale, maybe, we all know she's hungry for publicity, maybe killing is the only way to get some.  We all know Randy is in love with Sidney, maybe he thinks he can never get her, so he wants to kill her; Randy and Sidney both go to the same college, doesn't that seem a little strange; they went to the same high school, and now they go to the same college, hundreds of miles away from their hometown, Woodsboro?  Or even Cotton Weary (Liev Scheiber), the innocent man who was sent to death-row because Sidney falsely accused him of murdering her mother three years earlier, and now he want revenge?  The tale is just as terrifying as the original. This film is the best sequel I've ever seen.  It is just a good as the original.  No complaints.  Very scary, very funny, and very original just like `Scream'.  It's even very sad at one part is in the film, which also almost made me cry.  I won't give it away, but it has to do with Ghostface in the newsvan, (you'll know what I'm talking about after you saw this, or if you've already seen it).  You'll be touched by this shocking scene if you're a big fan of the original.  It's also got movie trivia, just like the first.  It's totally a movie for the horror buffs. I gave `Scream' 10/10, I decided it's fair to give `Scream 2' a 10/10, because it was just as good.  If you loved `Scream', I suggest you see this one too.  I would change nothing.",Scream 2
101,acidburn-10,Wes Craven does it again,9,1 June 2007,"The Plot line = 2 years after the horrific events in Woodsbrough Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) attempts to try and move on with her life by attending college along with fellow survivor Randy (Jamie Kennedy) but yet again there's another killer whose after Sidney's blood, after two college students are murdered while attending the premiere of ""Stab"" which is based on the events of the first movie and after that Sidney starts experiencing deja vu when the killer starts stalking her and taunting and as the body count begins to get higher and higher Sidney realises she's next can she survive again or will she end up dead.Scream 2 is everything a sequel should be more gore and a higher body count and plus yet again a long list of suspects. To be honest this was one the sequels I was looking forward too and gladly it didn't disappoint me. It still managed to keep the intensity and humour the first one did, the first Scream was like a tribute to 80's slashers and was quite frankly much better than them all and Scream 2 is a tribute to the 80's college slashers and again better than all of them put together.The characters themselves really made the movie as well the ones who came back are the lovely level headed Sidney (Neve Campbell) back, my fave Randy (Jamie Kennedy) the horror movie film buff who sadly doesn't get enough screen time, Dewey (David Arguette) the lovable silly policeman and the bitchy but sexy Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) who all come back but will they survive this time. We also get a host of new characters such as Dereck (Jerry O' Connell) Sidney's new boyfriend and possible suspect remember the first one could history be repeating itself, Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) the freaky Tarantino film student, Hallie (Elise Neal) Sidney's roommate and new best friend, Cotton Weary (Liev Shreiber) who appeared briefly in part one who got accused of killing Sidney's mother but was wrongly accused and could may well be out for revenge and lets not forget fellow scream queen Buffy er no sorry I meant Sarah Michelle Gellar looking gorgeous as ever in her few short lived minutes as one of the victims.The kills in this movie are cool, the suspense is there We also get lots of cameos (you spot them), a great phone conversation between Randy (Kennedy) and the killer and even a few nods Friday The 13th's way. But overall, this sequel rocks.The acting Neve Campbell is brill as always, David Arquette is lovable, Jamie Kennedy didn't get enough screen time, Courteney Cox is even sexier and bitchier in this one and gets yet another slap from Sidney. Jerry O' Connell did fine although a bit dull but still likable, Timothy Olyphant has great hair and has fun, Elise Neal was OK but not very interesting, Liev Shreiber to be honest I found that there was really no need to fetch his character back because he didn't bring anything new or exciting to the movie, Sarah Michelle Gellar is stunning as always, Laurie Metcalf truly shines although not until towards the end, Jada Pinkett well I was surprised to see her in this but does fine as one of the first victims and Omar Epps is cool but gets killed way too fast.All in all Craven does well again, injecting the suspense scenes with lots of tension, the film is definitely a worthy follow up and well and truly has it's moments and also I loved the cheesy twist ending.",Scream 2
102,Darkside-Reviewer,Who's the suspect now?,7,26 March 2019,Scream 2 is the worst of the franchise but still is by no means a bad movie its main problem is it follows the first movies story a little too much making it a little to predictable with its plot and making the who done it aspect of the movie easily guessed by a casual observer other than that the movie has a great cast who are at there best in every scene and we get some interesting kills with some decent gore I'd give this movie a watch but don't expect the best Scream movie going in.,Scream 2
103,eibon09,Cow Manure,2,13 November 2000,"Scream(1996) proved to be the major undoing of the Hollywood Horror film and Scream 2(1997) continues the trend of overrated and overbearing horror features in the USA.  This proves that most filmmakers in American today are clueless when it comes to making great horror films.  Scream 2(1997) begins on a good note but degenerates into a 2 hour repeat of the first film.  The opening scene in the movie theatre is a good homage to Lamberto Bava'a Demons(1985).  The acting overall is as lousy as the first film.  The movies of Dario Argento and Mario Bava may have had their share of flaws, but overall they almost always delievered something magnificent.
The first two Scream movies would have been wise to spent less time having the murderers behaving like failed stand up comics and more time making them into scary figures.  Neve Campbell gives the only decent performance of the feature.  Its a pity that she has to again run from her attacker until she is put in a corner.  The success of Kevin Williamson as a Horror Screenwriter must be a sign of the times.  I do not believe that he would have the same success in the late 1960's to mid 1980's because people had higher standards for horror films then.
Wes Craven has shown with his involvement in the Scream trilogy that he's a has been filmmaker.  At least movie makers like Dario Argento, George A. Romero, and David Cronenberg have not sold themselves out.  Scream 2(1997) plays its homage to the college theme slasher flicks of the early to mid 1980's.  It also rips off great Italian Giallos such as Torso(1973), Deep Red(1975), and Tenebre(1982).  If Tenebre's final fifteen minutes were breathtaking then the final fifteen minutes of Scream 2(1997) were horendous.",Scream 2

The comedy is minimised in favour of excessive violence, which, because the script avoids building up character, has, ironically, less impact than the original.  The early dispatch of Sarah Michelle Gellar without giving her anything to do is criminal, while Neve Campbell's inexpressivity is almost Franjuesque.

I should've seen Scream and Scream 2 back in the nineties where I was a kid, but I was just too frightened to see it. I think I had either Scream 2 or Scream 3 on video cassette.The first movie, Scream, was scary, but Scream 2 takes things to the next level. Basically, Scream 2 was more scarier than Scream. You can even tell the sequel is scarier. Scream 2 was very suspenseful. I liked the suspense. It was hard to predict what's going to happen. It's much more darker. I still found it very frightening despite being more older.I very much liked watching Scream 2 on my own with the lights turned off. Yes, I even had my blankets with me for the entire duration. It was a terrific experience. These are the sort of ""horror"" movies that interests me.The thing I didn't like was that it's easy to figure out who the killers were. I wasn't surprised at all. I knew there'd be a couple of killers, but I just didn't know their motive. You'll find out their motive if you see this till the end. However, I did like though who the killers were. It made sense I suppose. It just had to be those two. Both the choices on who the killers should be were right in my view.Sidney Prescott has another challenge. She's in college now. It's a new start for her until the killers show up. Let's not forget Sidney Prescott's ""friends"" who are also in this fight. I know Sidney Prescott likes Dewey or Dwight, but I don't think she likes the journalist or reporter named Gale Weathers.I really liked the part where the killer calls Sidney Prescott, and she answers the phone. The killer suddenly showed up at the doorstep attempting to attack Sidney Prescott. I also liked the part where a student named Cici Cooper gets killed a bit earlier. There were many good parts throughout the sequel. What's your favourite part?Scream 2 is the second best movie in the series no doubt. I think Scream just edges it.Scream 2 is a ""horror"", ""mystery"" and ""thriller"" movie. It's the greatest horror sequel to have come out from the nineties.",Scream 2

It also stated the famous lines AKA. the 'Three Rules' of a horror movie. Scream 2 as I said before, is aimed at horror sequels and yet again, it has it 'Rules To A Sequel.' The plot is almost identical to the first Scream. Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is a student at Windsor College. She has a new group of friends and is adjusting perfectly. That is until two college students are murdered at the opening night of 'Stab,' a movie based on the events at Woodsborro.

With outstanding performances by Arquette, Cox and Campbell. The script is once again great and the score still chilling. The film is bloodier than Scream with more deaths, as the rules have stated.

So, I had pretty low expectations of this film and on top of that, I've had a number of friends say that this is the worst in the series.  Needless to say, my expectations had hit rock-bottom!After seeing the film, I must say that I thought it was pretty good.  I don't know where I'd put this film compared to the first one, probably about the same likability for me.  I thought this film had a lot of good things going for it, I thought the story was pretty good and really kept you guessing.  I also REALLY liked the comedy in this film, David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy crack me up!  The only major complaint I have about this film is that they killed my favorite character in the series!  I won't give it away for those of you that haven't seen it, but the choices are pretty limited, there were only 5 or so actors that were in both ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" (and only one of them dies in part 2, so when you see the film you'll know who I'm talking about).The acting was pretty good in this film, I really enjoyed the cast in this film.  There were a lot of familiar faces and a lot of cameos: Tori Spelling, Heather Graham, Sarah Michelle Gellar, David Warner, Wes Craven, Joshua Jackson, Portia de Rossi, Omar Epps, and perhaps some others that I missed.  The core cast was really good as well: Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Jerry O'Connell, Liev Schreiber and everyone else. Great cast!I guess if you're into teen-slasher films and liked the first ""Scream"" film, then you should definitely check this out.

116,jhaggardjr,Very good horror sequel,8,22 June 2000,"While its not as good as the original, ""Scream 2"" is for the most part a very entertaining horror-comedy. Director Wes Craven, writer Kevin Williamson, and stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette came back for this sequel. This time Campbell's character Sidney Prescott is away at college when murders start happening again. Cox (as Gale Weathers) and Arquette (as Dewey) arrive at the campus to find out what's going on and to try to find the killer (since the cops are no good in these movies). ""Scream 2"" isn't as good as the original because it's a little slow-moving at times which wasn't the case with the first film. Still, I was entertained for the most part, and the supporting cast of new actors do a good job. The only other actors to return from the original are Jamie Kennedy as nerdy Randy (the horror movie expert) and Liev Schreiber as Cotton Weary, the man Campbell had put in jail for the murder of her mother but found out at the end of the first movie that he was innocent (Schreiber's part in the first movie was very brief; here he has a major supporting role). New cast members include Sarah Michelle Gellar (TV's ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer""), Jerry O'Connell (TV's ""Sliders""), Jada Pinkett (Mrs. Will Smith), and Laurie Metcalf (TV's ""Roseanne""). ""Scream 2"" is violent like the original and also like the first film has a sharp sense of humor. Worth a look.*** (out of four)",Scream 2
117,baileycrawly,More of the Same,6,18 September 2020,"Scream 2 is unique in the sense that it offers more of the exact same thing from the original, but it manages to pull it off slightly better.Granted, that's not to say it's a good film.We open up in a theater for the premiere of the tackiest film-within-a-film that's perhaps ever been committed to screen: a theatrical adaptation of the murders that occurred in the first film, based on the book written by the local reporter that involved herself in the original film. Of course, because it's a horror movie, we're gonna hand out masks of the killer to everyone in the audience so they can wear them and pretend to stalk around the theater killing the audience members, and it's all fun and games... until it's not.The opening for this film is the best thing it's got going for itself, because the rest of the film is just more of the same. It has a lot of the same cast from the original (a commendable achievement), including Neve Campbell's Sidney Prescott, who finds herself once again getting strange phone calls from a voiceboxed serial killer. It's a continuation of the same character-study kind of work that was done in the first one, expanding upon Sidney's badassery but not really justifying its own existence.You've got Jerry O'Connell (of Stand By Me fame) in perhaps the most awkward musical number in a horror film of all time, and even the great Laurie Metcalf (fresh off Roseanne at the time) couldn't save this film.It expands upon the relationship between the reporter, Gail, and the police officer Dewey, which really isn't interesting at all and provides nothing to the plot but filler material.Just like the first one, this film is way too long and they're trying to do far too much with it. It would've been a satisfactory experience at 80-90 minutes with most of the subplots either cut entirely or edited down to practically nothing and with the focus almost exclusively on the slasher element.This film is just a rehash of the original, trying to take what Wes did for the genre with the original and take it a step further. As is often the case with films like this, it takes everything two steps back. However, this film manages to have at least a couple entertaining scenes scattered throughout the boring and ass-numbingly long runtime.",Scream 2
118,SKG-2,Hell freezes over; I liked a sequel,8,27 February 1999,"One comment I read said that they didn't like sequels, but who does.  Well, SOMEBODY must like them, otherwise Hollywood wouldn't keep on churning the bloody things out!!!  With rare exceptions, I am not one of them, and so I was surprised to like this film, which I saw instead of THE RAINMAKER that night.  It's just as funny and surprising, and almost as scary, as the original.  Some have complained about who the killers were, and sure, logic wise, it's a bit creaky, but in the sense that this is an homage to horror films (slasher films in particular), it makes perfect sense.  The only problem I had is the problem I had with the first one, and indeed, most Wes Craven films except the first NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET; the climax is way too long.",Scream 2
119,AKS-6,"Better than ""Scream""",7,13 November 1999,"[This comment contains SPOILERS.]Well, as my summary clearly states, I'm one of those people who actually prefer the second Scream to the first. I believe that ""Scream 2"" is scarier, funnier and more interesting than the first one. I really like them both, because the two Screams are the only films that actually makes me jump (=better than Halloween and Friday the 13th). Now, there is one major flaw in the second Scream. The ENDING! My God, that was the most contrived ending I have ever had to endure (almost). I just moaned when I saw the film at the cinema the first time. But, as I said, I prefer it to ""Scream"" and it is definitely the best slasher horror film that I have ever seen.Oh, and David Arquette/Dewey is absolutely adorable!",Scream 2
120,chrisbrown6453,"Scream 2 had to be one of the most anticipated films of 1997. And when it was finally released, you weren't disappointed.",7,17 June 2002,"Picking up two years after the original, we find young Sydney in college, with her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy, the horror movie buff) and some new friends she's picked up along the way (including Jerry O'Connell as her new boyfriend). Reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox) is also back. Seems she's written a book about Sydney and her life, and it's been turned into a movie called Stab! At the premiere of Stab! a couple of people are killed, and everyone thinks its all starting over again. To the aid of young Sydney comes Dewey (David Arquette) who has seen better days. Soon people all over campus are being killed by someone in a Scream mask. Who is it this time? Everyone's a suspect, and everyone seems to have a motive. The only real difference between Scream 2 and the original is now you're sort of ready for the twists and turns. Director Wes Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson still serve up horror clichés, then shoot them down, but it's not as unexpected as before. But that doesn't mean the movie isn't as fun as the first. You still can't guess who the killer is until they decide to tell you (although I was a little disappointed in the ending). And the movie does slow down a little in the middle. Just before sitting down to watch Scream 2 I watched a copy of the original that had Craven and Williamson talking about the movie as it was happening. They mentioned that one of the producers told them they needed to kill someone off in the middle (turned out to be the principal) because you couldn't have a horror film where no one died for half an hour, and I wish they had done something like that here. The movie is still filled with pop-culture references (how many movies can mention Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon and the fact that The Empire Strikes back wasn't a sequel but a continuation of a trilogy?)
The main reason the original was fun was because it didn't assume that the audience is stupid, and just want a lot of blood and guts. Williamson knows that today's horror fans are more sophisticated, and expect a movie that makes sense. I enjoyed the movie a lot, and probably will go see it again. In the movie Randy at one point said, sequels suck. With this one, he was wrong. Here's looking to Scream 3.",Scream 2

There goes my ""useful comment"" rating!Not many movies beat their originals, especially in the horror genre. However, Scream 2 proved them wrong.Sidney has gone to college and moved on with her life after the events of Scream. However, the murders and famous ""ghostface killer"" have followed too. Sidney, Dewey, Gale, Randy, and Cotton all return from the first film. But we also get an interesting new group of people: Hallie, Derek, Mickey, Cici, and Debbie the reporter, who is actually more annoying than Gale.We also have a higher body count, more gore, more interesting kills, and a much better ending (in my opinion).I recommend this to fans of the original movie. 8/10.",Scream 2
122,skybrick736,Scream 2 (8/10),8,21 June 2016,"The genius of Scream 2 is the callbacks and homage it pays to former horror sequels and to the original Scream. Scream is iconic for its self-reflection, its placement in the horror genre, and the rules, which horror movies abide by. My own set of rules to a great sequel differ than the film. The rules are simple but are sadly not achieved as often as they should be. First, continuity, have a story that follows the events from the original or just limit the plot holes and have it be logical. Scream 2 passes the first rule with a big check-mark. Second, bring back major players, which Scream 2 exceeded at by starring Neve Campbell (Sidney), David Arquette (Dewey), Courteney Cox (Gale), Jamie Kennedy (Randy), and Liev Schreiber (Cotton). The third and final rule is a trickier concept to handle by filmmakers, which is maintaining the same atmosphere that made the original fantastic but to steer the story in a new direction. Wes Craven fulfilled all these rules, especially the third by preserving the character's personality, comedic moments, music theme, film style, and general mood and feeling of the film. Craven also connects the dots perfectly beginning to end on killer identity and motive and concluding with a satisfying ending. For all the reasons above, if I was in a film class and had to name a sequel that surpassed its original, one that would definitely come to mind is Scream 2.",Scream 2

124,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,8,25 November 2004,"POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!Not as good as the original, let's get that out of the way. It is part of a trilogy, and sequels are for the most part inferior. Wes Craven knows this, lets get that out of the way. But when the fans want more, and when the story isn't finished, sequels are inevitably made. But it is still a good movie, still better than any over the other teen slasher movies of the period, and retains many elements which made the original so good.OK, now that we understand Wes Craven knew exactly what he was doing, we can discuss the good and bad points. Bad- too many unnecessary characters, though strangely many of them are not killed or even attacked, and most of them do not do much, the twists are too unpredictable to work well, and it is maybe too short. Now the good stuff- each performance is good, though the Killer (s) is (are) too over the top. Neve is excellent again, and i'm not only saying that because i'm a fan, but she has grown as an actress now coping with the fame Scream brought her, ironically mirroring the fame Sydney gets from what happened in Woodsboro. The Arquettes are both very good, Randy is very funny again, and the scares are pretty good. The police car scene stands out. Again the film deals with mistrust and uncertainty, like most of Craven's films, and we sympathies with Sydney's struggles- it seems inevitable that she will never put these events behind her, and that it will be a great struggle for her to get close to anyone- her relationship with her new boyfriend shows this (played brilliantly by O-Connell). The script is sharp, and there are many in-jokes. Overall it is a good film, but a continuation a story because the impact the characters of the first film had was so big, we had to see how they would move on. It cannot be as original or fresh (grr) as the first film, but that does not matter, that's not the point. 8 out of 10.",Scream 2
125,bh_tafe3,Continues the momentum from the original,6,10 March 2010,"Scream 2 came hot on the heels of the original, with Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson signing on again to direct and write and all of the surviving original cast returning. And they are able to churn out a movie almost as good as its predecessor. While lacking the unique feel of the original, this movie picks up the ball and runs with it, crafting an entertaining film from the still fresh approach used in the original.The story here is that Gale Weathers has written a best selling book about the events of the first film, which has itself been turned into a film ""Stab"" (starring Tori Spelling in a nice little reference to a throwaway line of dialogue from the original). Sidney is now at College with a new boyfriend (played by Jerry ""Kangaroo Jack"" O'Connell) trying to move on with her life, but of course, it all starts to happen again. Two students from Sidney's College are found murdered at the ""Stab"" premier. She herself is attacked and she finds herself living once again in a real life horror film where everyone's a suspect.Scream 2 does have some welcome additions to the cast, with Sarah Michelle Gellar, Omar Epps and Jada Pinkett signing up to be slaughtered, and Timophy Olyphant showing some early promise as Mickey, the freaky Tarantino film student. Liev Schrieber's extended role is another nice addition.The script tends to be more an in joke on the original film rather than the horror genre, but there are still plenty of laughs to be had. The kills are more elaborate than in the original, which has the downside of also making them more absurd. Omar Epps death in particular bends logic.Overall though, while not as good as the original, Scream 2 is still far more entertaining than many movies that came out in the same period and is far from a bad way to spend two hours. Well worth a look.",Scream 2

But despite the fun it has with sequels and references to all sorts of other things it still comes back to being a slasher film and that really is a limitation. The original had the advantage of bringing back and all but dead (sorry!) genre and parodied many of the situations and archetypes that typified those films, the sequel does not have that advantage.",Scream 2

Or Just a Bad Sequel?,6,14 September 1999,"I can't decide if this was a really clever parody of a bad horror sequel... or if it just WAS one.I don't think the filmmakers could decide either.  I guess we won't know until we see ""Scream 3.""Horrible script, decent direction = not enough to warrant a need to ever watch it again.

129,Donatien3,"Something Old, Something New.",9,18 October 2020,"The best sequels build on the success of the first film and explores new ground: it's something that ""Scream 2"" does well.While there's the usual self-aware meta commentary (including a discussion of sequels) and kill scenes, ""Scream 2"" feels more like a murder/mystery than another parody of lame slasher films.Perhaps Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson felt they'd made their point in the first film and didn't see the need to stretch the joke for the sake of it. It works well, as simply re-treading the first film in a new location would have felt like an anti-climax.The biggest piece of meta commentary is the epic opening scene, with a raucous screening of ""Stab"", based on a book from Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox), which is a shot-for-shot copy of ""Scream"", with Heather Graham in the Drew Barrymore role. In a clever callback, Tori Spelling plays Sidney Prescott, which was a throwaway line in the first film from Campbell. Of course, people die in the cinema, with Ghostface able to blend in with all the people in replica Ghostface masks and enthusiastically wielding fake knives.Getting to the movie itself, and the original's protagonist Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now at college, and a Ghostface copycat killer is on the loose, with Weathers and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) on Sidney's tail. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber) - who was falsely accused by Sidney for her mother's murder - appears as an unexpected ally.The best moment is the bait-and-switch reveal of the killer: first it feels like a lazy rehash of the original, with Ghostface revealed to be Mickey (Timothy Olyphant) and a mystery partner, but then comes the rug pull, with Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalf) actually Billy Loomis' mother, and out for revenge for her son's death. Not only is it a nice link to the first movie, but it's far more plausible than pulling the 'double-killer' trick again.Overall, it strikes the right balance between fan service, referencing the first film, and trying something new.",Scream 2

Its funny, self-reflective and has an excellent plot and clever script, with plenty of twists and turns and red-herrings. The sequel opens at the premiere of ""Stab"", a film based on the events of the first film. It is a fun and memorable sequence where the rowdy audience all donned in Ghostface masks jump around and cheer on the killer. So when two people are actually murdered by someone who turns out to be a copycat killer, they do it right in the middle of the front row and no one bats an eyelid, thinking it part of the premiere. So begins a spate of new murders and we follow Cindy and the other survivors of the first film, now at University, as they find themselves on the killer's radar.

A new killer is stalking new victims, well awere of the rules of sequels. Here we have some new butcher-victims to ''slice and dice'' and Craven really follows those sequel-rules. The biggest different between S2 and its original is the amount of blood. This is what you can call a ''blood-show'' where the victims are lined up to get knives stucked up here and there. In the first movie I figured out pretty soon who the killers were (or it was at least my theory all the way out), but here it was so many people to choose from and that made it fun! It is ''Cluedo'' all the way, but when the killer (or killers, maybe killress) got revealed it was a slightly bad pick.

143,zac-04879,"Lives Up to the Original, But Really Takes its Time",6,21 August 2021,"A satisfying horror sequel that lives up to Randy's amusing rules for horror movie sequels. You can anticipate higher body count, an engaging mystery and another watchable Ghostface whodunnit, but the blood is slightly tamer and the structure isn't as appealing as the original.Writer Kevin Williamson and director Wes Craven are back to creating enjoyable suspense, fascinating new characters and the undeniably bloody slashings of a pleasing murderer. Without those ingredients and the return of Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox and David Arquette, Scream 2 would've just been a flat fail. Who wouldn't agree that we need the familiar cast and crew for a sequel if it's going to live up to 1996's surprise? Williamson is an excellent writer for these mystery-slashers and Wes Craven executes it amazingly.Why Scream 2 isn't as loveable as the first film is due to the design. Similar to the original, there's a gripping opening scene and the mystery becomes heavier over time. However, the entertainment value between there isn't exactly great. Is there any unnecessary material? There's plenty of it, just like most horror movies, but it gets dull. Scream 2 is pretty alike with Scream, so the massive fans will definitely love a new story and more brutal slayings.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Scream 2
144,Aly200,Adequate Sequel,7,26 July 2012,"I really enjoyed the first film due to its shock value and the terror and suspense it created, but 'Scream 2' kind of failed to impress me as well. The film seemed a little obvious by the close of the film when one of the killers was revealed. Plus you could predict when the calls were going to happen. The one scene that did scare me was the opening scene in the movie theater where the first two victims are murdered. Due to the recent Colorado shooting, this scene seems, to me, to be an eerie omen of the the possibility that this could happen. Still, the film was not the best sequel I've seen. The only good part was the first scene and the returning cast's performances.",Scream 2
145,Jerique,A great sequel to a great horror franchise!,8,6 February 2010,"Amongst the horror genre and slasher-type movies, Scream places at the top, for me. I believe with the addition of each sequel, Jason's value went further down. It's not the same when you speak about Kevin's writing. Scream 2 nearly out shines it's predecessor. Reprisals from the main actors really helped.There was still an incredible amount of suspense and mystery, and still gave the same vibe that Scream does about ""who killed who?"" I enjoyed every minute of the film and I found the character development endearing. No cheating and cheap shots involved in this sequel. It's true and loyal to it's fans.Horror fans will still have their heart pounding and blood turned to ice as it's just as scary as the original. Hardly any comedy doesn't help with calming the mind after a big scare scene either. But, comedic relief is not necessary.It still remains a satire film in making fun of the genre and of itself. It's fun to watch and very re-watchable. It shouldn't be assumed that sequels are always inferior. I believe Scream 2 is on equal grounds as Scream.",Scream 2
146,happyendingrocks,"Oh, you'll scream again... but this time you'll be screaming, ""I want my money back""",4,21 July 2009,"The original Scream was quite clever in how it lambasted the clichés inherent in the horror genre while simultaneously turning those clichés upside down and delivering some fresh elements. But devoting multiple scenes to detailed discussion about how sequels are naturally inferior in a film that does nothing to assert the falsity of that argument? Not so clever.Scream 2 is flawed on so many fronts, it's hard to know which ones to devote parts of my 1,000 word limitation to. I suppose it's best to start at the beginning, which in this film is devoted to a poorly executed and ultimately pointless exposition scene that makes no sense in the grand scheme of the film. Added to that is the lengthy diatribe Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps spar on that bemoans the lack of realistic African-American characters in horror films, which is delivered by characters that stringently adhere to the silliest and most annoying African-American stereotypes prevalent in cinema. Come to think of it, all of the characters of color in this film seem to embrace those same stereotypes, so in that context, the entire logic behind their spirited debate is more offensive than witty.We also spend a great deal of time with Jamie Kennedy's returning horror buff Randy, who continues his nauseating analysis of the flaws in the horror genre, specifically his afore-mentioned philosophy on the tendency of sequels to regurgitate the more successful elements of their original animus with diminishing returns. This bit worked very well in the first Scream, which flaunted its own breaking of this mold, thus relegating Randy's soapbox testimonials to the realm of satire. But there is no satire to be found here, just a series of unfunny scenes that manage the seemingly impossibly feat of making Jamie Kennedy more annoying than we knew he was going in, and pad out an already too-long two-hour running time in the process.Two sequences in particular dare the listener to stick with the film, which ultimately doesn't prove to be a wise decision when this entire mess plays out. Firstly, Jerry O'Connell's lunchroom serenade is such a sappy and idiotic number, any likability his character generates immediately evaporates. Watching the masses of students witnessing his stunt not only joining in the performance, but cheering wildly when he concludes the song and corners Sidney for a cringe-worthy PDA, makes us wonder which genre the film-makers are lampooning here. Hadn't these guys heard of ""deleted scenes"" before? Ditto for Sidney's meaningful discussion with her drama teacher about how artists channel their emotions into pathos in their performances, and the lengthy false-alarm scare that follows.And, despite Jamie Kennedy's claim that sequels utilize more elaborate kills, nothing in this film comes close to matching Drew Barrymore's shocking exit from the first Scream, Rose MacGowan's ride on the garage door, or the grand guignol finale of the piece. In fact, the film is so tepid in this regard, we're left wondering why they bothered pointing out that they weren't supposed to be.The wry humor has become a gimmick here, and though this film does indeed attempt to resurrect the strongest elements from the first Scream, this time out the horror is so banal that the humor dilutes the few true scares to be had. It's a shame too, since the unexpected cameos and humorous dramatizations of scenes from the first film are indeed refreshing and truly funny. But, the film-makers don't find the same balance they did before, so we're left wishing that they either toned down the humor or went the full-blown comedy route. This is far too lite to be a true horror film, but Ghosty's penchant for stabbing someone every 10 minutes will likely dissuade anyone from considering this a pure comedy.The twist ending that we know is coming is dicey at best, and it was foolhardy of the film-makers to believe that casting incidental characters as our killers would have the same impact as the conclusion of the original. Like most of the elements in this film, we have to suspend our disbelief here so fully that we're never able to become engrossed in the mystery or suspense, what little there is.And what super powers do our resilient returning characters have that allows one to be shot in the stomach and another to be eviscerated from behind, yet somehow survive their wounds without incident? The former even resurfaces in the final reel, walks off under their own power, and explains, ""I'm okay, the bullet just bounced off my ribcage""(?!). I'm not sure if this film takes place in an alternate universe future where medical science has advanced beyond our wildest dreams, but if this were the case, surely our killers should have been a bit harder to dispatch than the non-climax here would have us believe.When you consider how disjointed and auto-piloted this film is, it's easy to imagine that the film-makers knew they were working on a trilogy, and were reluctant to use what few surprises they still had left until the final film (this is even more foolhardy now, when we know a fourth Scream entry is forthcoming). While they certainly ensured that Scream 3 wouldn't have a hard time out-doing its predecessor, they also effectively buried any chance of this being a classic SERIES of films, rather than one of the one-hit wonders frequently referenced throughout.",Scream 2

Because the late 90's is a universe-theory of life period, of cloning intelligence.In addition:

151,Indy-52,"i love it as much as the first one, maybe even more!",8,3 January 2000,"this movie has to be the best horror sequel ever. That is because it surpasses its predecessor with ease. As much as i loved the original Scream, it can't top this one. It's just got more suspense, more slashes and more humor. The first one had many dull moments, like the ending (too much talking). But this one never disappoints, although i have to admit the opening scene in Scream 1 is better. But the problem is, it just goes downhill from there. But Scream 2, i don't watch only to see the opening scene, because the best parts are what comes after that. Especially the scene where the two girls have to get out of the car through the unconscious killer. This movie is just much more suspenseful than the first one!Good job Wes, you have accomplished the impossible: a horror sequel that is better than its predecessor.

152,Mr_Censored,"""Scream 2"" overcomes some obstacles to end up a respectable sequel and counterpart.",7,19 June 2009,"Wes Craven's ""Scream"" was such a smashing success that a sequel was quickly rushed into production, and in 1997, ""Scream 2"" was born. Re-uniting Craven and screenwriter Kevin Williamson, the film also saw the return of its surviving stars as well as the now-iconic Ghostface killer, who, for obvious reasons, carries an alternate identity than that of the killer(s) in the first film. Stalking Sidney and her friends at college, the film centers around the damaged character and the paranoia that continues to cripple her life. As Deputy Dewey puts it: ""You probably already know him...or her...or them. They're probably already in your life. They get off on that.""The film can't help but feel redundant when compared to its predecessor, especially when it comes to its surprise finish. That's not to say the film is a complete re-hash though. Thankfully, it still puts your expectations through the loops and keeps you on the edge of your seat with some nail-biting suspense and gruesome blood-shed. In fact, when you compare it to other like-minded films of the time (see: ""Scream"" rip-offs), it's downright nasty and fun at the same time! The college campus setting also helps change things up a bit, and with so many horror sequels ripe for the picking, ""Scream 2"" is to horror sequels what ""Scream"" was to horror movies in general. It ups the ante, raises your expectations and (for the most part) meets them.The direction by Craven seems a little more confident this go-round, which is unfortunate since Williamson's script gives its characters clunky and awkward dialogue to spit, which severely drags down the film. The first one was whip-smart, but this one's a little milder. The tone of the flick and the overall plot is just-right; it's in the little things that bog the flick down. Even still, its flaws are minor, and it's got another great, talented cast, some of whom meet unfortunate and grisly demises. Keep an eye out for wacky Aunt Jackie from ""Roseanne"" herself, Laurie Metcalf, in a seemingly minor but memorable role.",Scream 2
153,dormesher-21565,My favourite,9,2 March 2019,"Scream 2. My favourite in this fantastic Slasher franchise I love this movie its always been my favourite in the franchise Sindey is more bad ass the kills are alot better and its just alot more fun in my opinion.
The reveal of the killer I love In this one it's a great twist and a fantastic final act In the theatre.This movie starts when I killing happens at the premiere of Stab a movie based on the events of the first Scream film and then a new wave of murders begin and the mystery starts again.
Stab will become a stable in the franchise after this movie and is all apart of this movies meta style that runs through the whole franchise.Neve Campbell is fantastic once again and is definitely the highlight of this franchise I also love the other characters in this one aswell another favourite of mine is definitely Randy which I was shocked by his death the first time I watched the movie and it still gets me today he was a great character.You also see more of Cotton Weary in this one and it's great that they followed that story on from the original.The meta style is brillant in this one with the rules of a horror sequel playing full force In this more kills because core audience just expects it that stuff is awesome I love how this franchise plays on that stuff its fantastic and brilliantly.Just another great entry in the series and my favourite just alot more fun the story is better and I love the kills.Favourite moment is when Sidney and her friend are in the car and they have to get out through the window and the camera pans over Ghostface it's such and adds alot of suspence to the movie.Verdict 9.1/10 my favourite in the franchise love every moment",Scream 2

This installment takes place at college, a few years after the original, with most of the main characters returning. People are being murdered and Neve seems to be the main target.Empowerment of Women in Crisis situations may work on the screen, but not in real life.

Not too interested to know why they had the whole sorority kidnap party thing...Besides that, Jerry O'Connell and Neve Campbell have no connection or chemistry it seems like...BAD couple choice! overall this film is still better than ALOT of the late 90s horror films.

158,Dragoneyed363,Incredibly surpassing sequel,10,24 May 2008,"After the Scream phenomenon, it was only natural that a sequel was in the works. While most slasher sequels tend to be a let down and not live up to their first by having a ridiculous premise or not having the needed characters, Scream 2 is entirely different. This sequel was excellent, and lived up to the first Scream perfectly, when I did not think it would on first viewing. I mean, I was expecting it to be good, but not as good as it was. It's premise was wonderful, and the characters are amazing, because it has all the characters, that aren't already victims, from the first and more that are just as fun. All in all, it was a joyous outcome.Scream 2 is not afraid to kill off whoever it wants to, like the one before and after it, even though that one does not have as many fans as the first two. It has some new twists, and the execution style is just as professional and cunning as the first. It keeps you totally entertained and the performances are just as fun. While of course it is not as good as the original, it is pretty close, I must say, and that of course is an accomplishment in itself. After the events of Woodsboro, California, Sidney and Randy soon realize that a killer is on the loose again, this time at the college they are attending in Ohio. Dewey arrives on the campus to once again protect Sidney, and she and Dewey have an unwelcome reunion with Gale. How pleasant, we have all our old friends back, and the cast pulls out all the stops with their characters like they did in the first. It's still gritty and bloody, and it's also loaded with lots of nice material matter. I do not understand why it is not as appreciated as it is, regarding the rating mostly. Scream fans and horror lovers were all pleased with this movie when it came out, so I have heard, and I was as well.",Scream 2
159,thefan-2,"Silly, but on to itself",8,29 April 1999,"Not really a serious slasher movie, but a subversive swipe at our media culture, it succeeds grubbily where The Truman Show fails elegantly.  It helps to have seen Scream 1, if only to recognize that Tori Spelling playing the Neve Campbell character in Scream 2's movie-within-a-movie version of the story of Scream 1, is the very thing the Neve Campbell character jokingly predicted would happen in Scream 1.The punch line of Scream 2 comes at the very end.  The movie's many lapses into false gore, false pathos and false sentimentality are probably necessary evils, and in any case they don't detract from the fun.Things like ""It was my head, but Jennifer Aniston's body,"" and ""At least you were played by David Schwimmer,"" and that bitchy dissection of the latest Party of Five episode by two sorority girls, will all sail sadly over the heads (beneath the dignity?) of art house types who wouldn't be caught dead watching a sitcom.  But there are other things they might get. There's the cell phone/cordless phone theme: Also, caller ID makes its first appearance in a movie in Scream 2 -- there's none of the anachronistic call-tracing nonsense we still see in other movies.   (FBI agent whispers desperately: ""Keep him on the line for another 45 seconds, for chrissake, we've almost got him!"" -- and in real life  the rest of us know who's calling on the first ring.)",Scream 2
160,Mickey Knox,this should've been the last,8,21 December 2000,"After the huge success with the best horror of all time, Scream, Wes Craven comes back with the sequel: Scream 2. Unlike most of the sequels, this one does not suck. Actually it's a very good movie. But not as good as the original. 2 years after the events in the first film, the terror starts again for Sidney. A killer copycats the murders from Woodsboro, exactly in the week of the premiere of Stab, movie made after the events in the first part.Scream 2 does a very good job with the story and the action scenes: very well done and some of them very tensed. Still the phone-terror used in the first part is not that developed and scary. Except for this element, Wes keeps everything that goes well in the original. Including the very clever dialogue that worked so good in Scream.After a surprising success (nobody expected Scream 2 to be a good movie, after the fabulous first part), Wes Craven should've stopped while he was on top. But he didn't. He chose more money in stead of being the undisputed God of horror films. And so Scream 3 was born: much much weaker and stupider than the first 2. Scream 2 was very good and if you're a fan of horrors go watch it. You'll like it. Vote: 8 out of 10.Oh, one more thing. ""What's your favourite scary movie?"" ""Showgirls.

The scene where Sidney and her friend got trapped in a police car while the killer passed out in the front seat yet they both managed to get away is kinda extravagance. Well, maybe it was the killer's trick, though. But how do I know? The ending where Sidney and the killer were dueling was my favorite part. What Sidney did was so awesome. This girl really can act fast and unerring even when in a tough situation. Too bad, the scene where Gale rose up after being shot gave me a weird face.

The reason this one is even half as good as the first one is because of returning director Wes Craven, and the cast of course who all graciously returned. The most disappointing thing about this film was the death of Jamie Kennedy's character Randy Meeks who I loved. After seeing the first Scream my life was forever touched by the lovable rants of Randy. I live my life by his teachings and still to this day shed a tear when I think of his demise. He was more than just a character to me, he was like family. When I was sitting in the dark lonely theater back in December 1997 watching this I shrieked in terror as the blade went into Randy and ended the magic that was his character. I was ticked. The film has it's moments though. I love the evolution of Sydney Prescot and think they took her in the right direction. I hate the fact that Courtney Cox and David Arqette survived this outing. i thought is was placeable in the first one but outrageous in this one. The over all dark town of this film seemed to jive well with the continuation of the first one's more pastel look. Don't think I do not like this movie, because I do. It like the first one defined who I am and I could never complain about that as I like me. I just feel this film could have let Randy live an had Dewey and Gail die.",Scream 2

Director Craven and screenwriter Williamson are back for a second round. And this time, it's with good intentions. Necessary? I perhaps not, but effective? Certainly. The body count's increasing, and the games are back and better than ever.What separates ""Scream 2"" from the other lackluster sequels is how true it stays to its source material, while bringing something new to the table. In my opinion, while ""Scream"" was unpredictable, this film is definitely more surprising in terms of the whodunit premise. There are tons of twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat.Not to mention the performances are still strong. The characters have matured and are evolving in their roles, which is always welcome. The script... what can I say? The one liners pack the same hard punch, and the lines are delivered greatly. As for the suspense, there's definitely more where that came from. ""Scream 2"" doesn't skimp on the goods.Also, remember the iconic 12-minute opening in ""Scream"". Yeah well, ""Scream 2""'s is just as great. Without spoiling too much, the setting's at a movie theatre, and boy does it not disappoint.Anything else? While this is one neat production, I thought the film was bloodier, but not gorier. ""Scream"", in terms of deaths, is stronger, whereas ""Scream 2"" consists of mostly just stabs and ounces of that red stuff. ""Scream 2"" is another home run for Craven.

170,leoxatzian,A slasher sequel finally done right.,7,11 April 2019,"If you thought that slasher movie sequels could be nothing more than an inferior continuation to the original and provide nothing new or innovative, ""Scream 2"" is here to prove you wrong. The entertaining characters, suspenseful directing and unique kind of meta humor that you loved from the original are back and combined with an exciting new plot, proving that even slasher movie sequels can be great as long as there's enough care and passion put into them.",Scream 2
171,rebecca-ry,A Worthy Sequel,7,31 May 2012,"'Scream 2' was the sequel to 'Scream', made only a year after its predecessor, it was clearly in high demand. It was a good film overall, it certainly would not be added to the long list of sequels which didn't live up to their previous films - as it is discussed IN the film. Again, the references to movie cliché's and common movie stereotypes and rules is very interesting and can be really funny as you find yourself agreeing with the characters when they discuss films. Wes Craven created a very worthy sequel, the dialogue, as with the first one, was probably the strength of the film. Neve Campbell's role was pretty much the same with no huge development in her character but she performed well and kept her acting up to the same standard as in 'Scream'. The two recurring characters who really out-did themselves in this film were Courtney Cox and David Arquette, both their characters developed substantially in this film and both actors did so very well. The script was well done but was slightly more predictable this time. When it came to who the killer eventually was, you had already worked out this because they had been absent for no apparent reason from the story for over half an hour. However, Craven did add some surprises and there were aspects of the story - both funny and scary - that you did not see coming. There was a lot more violence in this film and the body count is bigger as stated in the trailer, this film is definitely more horror than black comedy but there are some really great scenes featuring both. Overall, 'Scream 2' is not as good as the first one but it is still definitely worth a watch. Don't watch this unless you have watched the first one because you will be lost within the opening minutes of the film.",Scream 2
172,IamROCKAS,Surprisingly a good follow-up to the original,7,15 July 2020,"The original covered all of the horror movie tropes and the sequel covered all of the horror movie sequel tropes, which I find both meta and awesome. I don't think this is as good as the original but it had some good kills and the mystery element is in the atmosphere throughout the whole movie. Too bad we don't get too familiar with the bad guys before they are revealed, they sit in the shadows for most of the movie. Also, just like in the original, I would love to praise the soundtrack for giving this movie some extra life.",Scream 2

Like many sequels, it took elements from the first film and simply made it bigger! While it obviously isn't as legendary (or good) as the first film, it's still very entertaining and is probably the second-best movie of this franchise. Overall, this was a really good sequel that never slowed down and made it very hard for Scream 3 to be good.8.1/10.",Scream 2

175,TheSeaLion,Better than the original,9,22 February 2015,"I know my statement that ""Scream 2"" is better than the first ""Scream"" isn't a new one, but I have to jump on the bandwagon here because that is indeed the case. ""Scream 2"" is not only better than the original, it's one of the best horror sequels I've seen and the best self- aware movie I've ever watched. While the later films in the ""Scream"" franchise and the abominable ""22 Jump Street"" fail at the sequel self-awareness, ""Scream 2"" succeeds creating an enjoying, scary, and entertaining second installment to a franchise. Opening up in a movie theater at the premiere of the film Stab, a movie based on the events of the first film, two college students (Jada Pinkett Smith and Omar Epps) are brutally killed by someone dressed in the same costume as the original killer. The two college students just so happen to attend the same college as Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell), the main character of the first film. Along with Sidney are several characters returning from the previous film including her friend Randy (Jamie Kennedy), police deputy Dewey (David Arquette), and ruthless news reporter Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox). Also appearing as either victims or suspects are Sidney's new boyfriend Derek (Jerry O'Connell), her friends Hallie (Elise Neal) and Mickey (Timothy Olyphant), and the man that Sidney wrongly convicted of murdering her mother, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber).While self-awareness is something I usually hate in movies because I think it makes them hypocritical, ""Scream 2"" does it right. For one thing the movie doesn't use self-awareness to cover for itself because it's a sequel. Along with that, though, the movie has a few clever inclusions to it to make it look like a typical sequel. A lot of the time, sequels are just the original redone in a different way. With the inclusion of people watching scenes from Stab, the audience is literally re-watching the same movie as the first one. Another example is Gale's cameraman Joel (Duane Martin) knows that to survive he has to get away before anything happens. He leaves the film half-way through, only to return at the end, unharmed and thus surviving the movie. The only time the self-awareness comes off as hypocritical is when a sorority girl named Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar) hears a noise and starts searching the house after she already had the bright idea to leave it.One thing the movie did was develop the characters more. In the first movie, Gale and Dewey are hinted at having some sort of interest in each other, but it's not anything important. In the second film, they expand on that idea to give them a deeper connection. The movie also displays the effects of the first film weighing heavily on Sidney, with minor things like slight differences in her characters actions and way of thinking to more extreme things with her not fully trusting Derek because of her boyfriend from the first movie's inclusion in the murder spree.This movie had a lot of scary and suspenseful moments, the best being when Sidney is rehearsing the play she's in and with all of the effects and extras dancing around on stage with fake weapons and creepy masks, she either sees or imagines the killer running around on stage trying to get her. This movie also carries on the use of elaborate red herrings that the first movie used, making you think it could be anyone. And while this movie does do that, the knowledge that this movie is a sequel makes you wonder whether or not they're going the same route or not.""Scream 2"" is a well thought out self-aware horror film with a lot of attention placed into the atmosphere of the movie. The movie is aware that it's a sequel and that sequels are usually inferior to the original, but the people behind the movie worked to make it better. They did more with the characters, they didn't hit rewind with the story, they let the events from the first film actually effect the story, and made a suspenseful, scary movie all at the same time.",Scream 2
176,DoctorSkyTower,COMPLETE SHAT,1,19 December 1999,"WARNING!!! TINY SPOILERS AHEAD! AVOID READING IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THIS MOVIE!I watched this on TV and contemplated picking up the remote control and switching channels. Wow!!! Have you ever seen a more dramatic opening? The 2nd death was so utterly stupid and un shocking it was (probably unintentionally) funny. I mean, who gets stabbed in the back and then wanders up on stage to die dramatically in front of an unbelievable audience of YOUNG ADULTS acting worse than a classroom full of 8 year old spoiled brats? 
However I sat there and hoped it would improve, since I'd seen the first movie and it was OK. It didn't! This load of shat was boring, predictable and not at all funny, although it tried to be. Nearly every character was killed off like fodder in a war zone, yet this is Suburban Beverly Hills Campus (or wherever the heck it was). When the next character bit the dust, and the next, I didn't care!!! At all!!The story was so lame it was laughable - a mere dumb excuse to kill people and see a ton of blood splashing all over the place. But a movie about another book/movie called ""Stab""? How original a name is THAT??The ending was utter tripe, but I won't delve into that. The killers' reason for the bloodbath was just plain dumb, but I shall leave that for you to deal with.  CONCLUSION: Abysmal Rubbish! BOOO!",Scream 2
177,WasiReviews,I Needed More Scream Content,8,10 March 2021,"The second film in the Scream franchise feels like a two hour extension to the original story with the gang over at college. Right off the bat my biggest issue with the film is the death of Marty. It's not the fact he died; it's the damn way they killed him like seriously? He didn't even get a night time kill, they killed him in the damn middle of the school's campus. My second biggest gripe is the fact the whodunnit aspect of the film was incredibly dumb and soo far out that nobody can tell who it was because the culprit wasn't in the film for like an hour after the 30th minute. Then there was Steven Ulrich's mom that I didn't care for, and who came out of nowhere. The positive aspects of this are mainly Sidney, she's a great protagonist (arguably one of the greatest horror protagonists) and keeps it up in her second best performance in the Scream Franchise. No matter how bad this franchise gets (Scream 3) Sidney, Courtney and Sheriff Dewey will always be an awesome crime solving trio kind of like Scooby Doo without the dog. Also can I talk about Courtney like damn this is peak Courtney Cox. Whoever did Courtney's hair in the third film should be jailed. Sidney's boyfriend Derek Feldman is kind of cringe but also kind of cool sometimes, especially towards the end of the movie. Gale and Dewey are such a great couple I'm glad they got married in real life and Wes Craven made fun of that in the 3rd film where they get married both in the film and real universe. The soundtrack was new and improved it trys some of those cool 90s horror beats that pay zero tribute to the 80s and instead makes it on it's own which I can appreciate. Overall it was fun but I recommend finding and watching the 1080p remastered version of Scream 2 because the version I watched had awful video quality. Overall it's not a bad film; especially if you need more Scream content after finishing the first Scream then this is definitely for you.",Scream 2
178,twpain,Awesome Sequel,8,7 June 2020,Scream 2 is an underrated movie in my opinion. There is really good Ghostface sequences and you get to learn more about the main character. This film really keeps you guessing who is behind the acts of Ghostface!,Scream 2
179,drawlife,A horror sequel that defies all horror sequel expectations.,9,3 September 2015,"Watching horror movies is one thing, but surviving them is another and Scream 2 sets the bar higher, and to be honest it should have ended here. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson take it to high gear this time around. It's a lot less subtle and more in your face, which is a nice change of pace compared to the first film, cause you cannot do what you did in the first movie. Like the first film, it's hilarious with the self-aware characters and the jokes that come with it, but it still takes the kills very seriously. Craven and Williamson keeps the guessing game going and it still makes us wonder who the damn killer is. The main players, Neve Campbell, David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Jamie Kennedy are back. What makes this Scream special is that the cast is likable, perhaps in my own opinion a little more likable than the original. The last two don't have any characters that are as likable as first Scream and this sequel. All the cast are great. Jerry O'Connell, Timothy Olyphant, Elise Neal, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Liev Schreiber, etc. They all come to play and bring their A-game. You also feel for most of the cast. The script has fun making Derek, played by Jerry O'Connell a potential suspect. The film show's Sidney's rightful paranoia, like the little moments where Derek offers her a seat and she sits next to Timothy Olyphant's character Mickey. You can't help but maybe feel a little sorry for him, but yet ponder if he is behind all the killings. Williamson does a great job juggling all these characters. What I respect about Scream 2 is that it doesn't play it safe at all. It takes risks and makes no apologies. They kill off, who is arguably the most popular character in the series Randy Meeks. It takes balls to do that, but I'm glad they did. I love Randy, but his death just made Scream 2 that much more unpredictable and immediately the stakes are much higher. They didn't play it safe. Props to Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven. Some may ponder that Sidney and Randy were destined to be together, and probably should have died in the third film while they end up as a couple, but even if that may have been cool, killing him off in this sequel makes everything unpredictable and makes a bigger shocking impact. Speaking of impact, the killer reveals are quite a surprise. Mickey(Olyphant) was expected, but Craven and Williamson do a nice homage to Laurie Metcalf's Mrs. Loomis, Billy's mother. Breaking a rule of a serial killer typically being a male, as well as tributing other female killers in cinema, particularly Mrs. Voorhees from the Friday the 13th franchise.The first Scream is game changer, but in the second film, it solidified Sidney Prescott being poison. If you're friends with Sidney you die, like poor Randy Meeks. You would think all the main players are safe, but they're not, at one point you even think Dewey is toast. You just don't feel safe for anyone else, and what I love is that it spoofs itself, cause Randy's argument is that sequels, especially sequels to horror films are garbage, ironically making Scream 2 being one of the few horror sequels that is considered to be worthy compared many atrocious horror sequels that killed the genre. It's meta, even before people knew what meta was.9/10",Scream 2
180,Jerry Ables,Fantastic sequel,10,8 November 2001,This film works very well as a sequel to what is very easily one of the greatest horror movies ever.

181,darkwizard404,Decent sequel,7,14 October 2021,"This was a decent sequel but has its fair share of negatives. This one was slightly longer which was unnecessary.

The characters in this movie are not only smart, but they actually care for each other.  There are problems though. The movie seems to loose track of where and how the killer gets where he is. They put them in most places at once or gives them very little time to get there from where they were earlier. And how does the killer get everyone's phone number? And how does he jam a door so no one else can escape yet he escapes when he needs to? I was kinda hoping  this movie would answer some of these questions. But I like how they give the killer personality. HE's not dull but scarier than most killers and more interesting than Michael Myers in halloween: H20.",Scream 2

Now i'm not saying this movie was a major bumber, but it was nowhere near as good as the original. I think watching scream 3 would be a waste of time and money. Here is my score for Scream 2: C",Scream 2
185,darkjosh,"Like Most Sequels, Nowhere Near the First",6,23 November 2000,"For some reason, Scream 2 seems like a movie that was forced to be made just because of the huge success of the first's original formula, that is, to overtly reveal the cheap tricks of the horror movie.  It doesn't seem fresh, has a thin storyline, contrived characters, plays like a rehash, and concludes with an ending that seems patched on and is completely unsatisfying.Scream 2 starts up with a fantastic shocker of a scene, where a murder takes place in a movie theater showing the film ""Stab,"" a spinoff of the events in Woodsboro in the first Scream film.  It's a terrific opening, as we see that Neve Campbell is now in college and is unnerved by the killing, suspecting it could be the 'sequel' she was warned about in the first installment.While the movie may start with a fantastic, twisted scene, it's all downhill from there.  The survivors from Scream are back, and their familiarity helps bolster the sometimes slow, plodding scenes.  There's also much more gore here, but while Scream used it sporadically, Scream 2 certainly seems to rely on it to shock its viewers rather than the clever, manipulative scripting of the first.  The device of revealing the horror movie convention doesn't seem as fresh anymore; instead it seems like a cheap convention itself.Not to say there aren't some scenes in Scream 2 that aren't wonderfully shot by Wes Craven, including a thrilling (if not too short) car chase, a frenzied search for a cell phone, and a poignant death.  But it's ending is much too farfetched and strikes the viewer much like the killer strikes with his knife: completely out of nowhere, without warning.Scream is by far the superior of the trilogy, feeling much more inventive than this sequel.  When a film student in the movies remarks that ""the sequel destroyed the genre,"" you can't help but feel it's true at the end of this movie.  Fans of the first will be certainly be disappointed with this film's lackluster script and contrived ending.  6 out of 10",Scream 2
186,Phantasm01,Just as good if not better then the original,8,25 July 2006,"""Scream 2"" is possibly the best horror movie sequel ever, and that's because it stays in touch with the ideas and plot structure of the first film, relying on the old clichés to give us another fresh and involving thriller. I'd even go so far as to say that this movie is superior to its predecessor, and that judgement lies with the character development and its comical treatment of the subject matter, while also being as cunning and inventive as ""Scream,"" keeping us at bay until the unexpected resolution.""Scream 2"" is a parodical look at the first film, beginning with a special screening of the new movie ""Stab,"" which is based on the book ""The Woodsboro Murders"" written by Gale Weathers. At the screening, two college students are brutally murdered by a man in that same old ghost mask. Not that he/she would be easy to spot: the studio gave away ""Stab"" costumes to all the audience members, and everyone is running all over the place. The whole movie angle provides for some of the tension, because no one believes that the murders are interconnected, perpetuating the action.Soon, news of the murder gets back to Sidney Prescott, now a college student, who consults Randy, also at college, on what he thinks is going on. She now has a potential boyfriend, Derek, who appears to genuinely care for her, and friends Mickey and Halle, typical college students who are put into the story for good measure.Or are they? Like ""Scream,"" the sequel also makes everyone out to be a possible suspect through their actions and their words, which keeps the suspense unbearable in wanting to know who the killer is. As Sidney and others have their own opinions, reporter Gale Weathers, now a network reporter, retrieves her old ambitions and does everything to get the story, with exhonerated convict Cotton Weary, the man formerly accused of Sidney's mother's murder, chasing her for airtime. Not to mention the pesky reporter who looks up to Gale with every inch of her being.The film's shock quotient is extremely high, keeping us involved and wanting to know who is going to get killed next. Most of the murdered characters are secondary, leading up to murders of certain important actors that point to other as the suspects. The plot has all the machinations and clichés of the first film, again using it to its advantage in propelling its plot forward while giving those old horror tactics a fresh new look.What really makes this movie shine over the predecessor is the characterization of its characters. The Sidney of this movie is much stronger, much more stable than in the first movie, which provides a lot in keeping the movie going. Neve Campbell reprises her role, and does some of the best acting of the movie. The relationship between Deputy Dewey and Gale Weathers is intensified further here, and Courteney Cox and David Arquette are the perfect pair for the job. Cox especially shines here, bringing out more of Gale's ambitions which later become replaced with fear. Liev Schreiber portrays Cotton Weary, who really has nothing to do here but follow people around, but watch out for his chance to save the day.Telling you anymore than I already have will spoil the movie, which is full of surprises and stunning twists. This movie has a more adult feel than the first, which will provide for even more entertainment to moviegoers. There is so much fun to be had with ""Scream 2,"" which is solid entertainment full of suspense and intelligence.",Scream 2

Now onto Scream 2, this was a good attempt to jump out of the shadow of the original. The story line was weak and there was only one killer who had a motive. I was glad to see they kept 4 of the original characters,but like I said there was a weak story line, the motive by the killer was complete crap and to top it all off they killed off my favorite character.......guess who that is.

190,Funky A,This movie says that sequels suck and proves it!,4,18 February 2000,"I did not have high expectations for this sequel of the overrated Scream, and I didn't get much. What I got was a good discussion about sequels, appearances by Randy and Dewey(the only characters I liked in Scream) and a pointless slasher with an even weaker story than the first one. I didn't like the characters in the first Scream. They annoyed me. Well, the characters in this one are replacements for the victims of the first movie and survivors of Scream. So I hated the characters in this one as well. It is even less frightening than the first one!!! The fresh side of the first one is not there anymore(the movie is almost identical to the original Scream). You know the scenes before you have seen them, since they are the same as the original Scream, and when I say same, I really mean SAME. But as they say in this movie, sequels suck... The killer(or maybe... killerS...) was logical in the first one but this time, it's so stupid(------ SPOILER WARNING: I mean, come on, they introduce a character that you knew nothing about at the end and say it's one of the killers... This makes it impossible to get that ""How could HE do that"" feeling. And another thing, maybe I found this one even weaker than the first one because they killed the best character, Randy. Randy was the best character and they KILLED HIM!------END OF SPOILER---------- Anyway, Scream 2 is even weaker than the first one in my opinion. Still, it's an above-average slasher, much better than craps like Urban Legends and I Know What You Did Last Summer, and all the other ""sons of Scream"". But, again, that doesn't make it a good movie.

On the other hand, I believe that this is a great sequel, but I didn't enjoy it as much as the first.In this film, history repeats itself. After the events in Scream, they decided to make a movie within a movie called Stab. Someone is trying to act out the killings in stab. A copycat killer is on the loose!Even though I had fun with this film, I just thought the original had more to say about the story structure of horror films.

193,Xophianic,Better than the first!,9,6 February 2000,"I really enjoyed SCREAM because I thought it was a very original horror movie. I liked SCREAM 2 for the same reason. The story line is pretty much the same as in SCREAM, but I thought the acting, characters, and death scenes were all better.Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has gone off to college to become and actress. Now that she has left her past behind her, she is doing better. She has a new best friend/roommate named Hallie (Elise Neal), a new boyfriend and a new life. But when somebody starts killing people in the same style of the killer, Sidney finds out that her past has come back to haunt her. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), old prime suspect proven innocent of the murder of Sidney's mom from SCREAM, returns to try and get publicity for his part in all of this. Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy) returns as the movie expert and Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox) return to try and protect Sidney.The plot is pretty much the same as SCREAM, but instead of poking fun of horror movies, they poke fun at sequels. When the college students argue about whether sequels can be better than the original, it's priceless.The acting is even better in this movie than in SCREAM. Neve Campbell does her usual teriffic job. David Arquette and Courtney Cox are even better in SCREAM 2 than they are in SCREAM. Sarah Michelle Gellar and Jada Pinkett are the equivilant of Drew Barrymore in SCREAM. They both do fair jobs, especially Sarah. Liev Schreiber and Jamie Kennedy do great jobs, and Roger L. Jackson returns at the bitchin' phone voice. (By the way, in a movie full of the biggest teenage stars of today, Joshua Jackson has a good cameo.)The character development is even better in SCREAM. You will, once again, find yourself screaming at the characters to run and get away. Sidney and Gale are just as cool as they were in the first one. Dewey and Randy are both extremely better characters in this one than in SCREAM. In SCREAM, Randy was annoying and an almost pointless character. In SCREAM 2, he's my favorite. The addition of Cotton Weary in this movie is suberb.I thought SCREAM 2 was better than SCREAM. Most people will think it is just as good or almost as good as SCREAM.

But that was before the opening night of 'Stab', the movie account of the horrific slayings at Woodsboro, based on the best-selling book written by Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox). Now a 'copycat killer' is one the rampage and wants Sidney dead, again. As the body count rises the pressure becomes unbearable. No one is safe, and everyone is a suspect.The great performers return from the first film - Neve Campbell is brilliant as Sidney, and Jamie Kennedy reprises his role as geek Randy perfect and David Arquette and Courteney Cox, who where rudely underused in the original, deserve credit for their more-developed characteristics. Wes Craven returns to the director's seat again, and he puts lots of effort into this killer sequel.

The killer chases innocent teens and kills the off one by one, it may seem silly to some buts it is actually quite good all the way through. If you havent seen scream 2 i recommend you see it.

I though Scream 2 was good and hip but it cannot live up to the amazing original. Neve Campbell is one of the finest actresses around and she portrays this role very well, again.

199,GluStick,Great movie. How many horror movies can say that about their sequels?,8,7 July 1999,"This was a cool follow-up to the scary Scream. It tells about the survivers from the first movie. It has Sidney being stalked again by a different psycho while she's at college. It has great action sequences and some really good scares but, of course, it's not as good as the first. The end of the first was better than this but the end will have you on the edge of your seat also. It's really hard to guess who is stalking  Sidney because you really wouldn't know even if you went down the whole list of the cast. It's someone that isn't even the person you wouldn't think. It has a really good plot and great acting and it's really good because most horror sequels suck so much. It's fun and at the same time frightful. Scream 2: B+",Scream 2

Now, Sidney, Gale, Dewey, and Randy search for clues of who the killer could be as more people fall victim to Ghostface.review: The sequel to one of the most popular slashers of all time, Scream is just ok. The beginning is cool where two college students are murdered in a theatre while watching a movie based on the Woodsboro murders. Then after that there are some funny scenes involving the survivors from the original and there new friends. Then the second death scene is cool.

201,Rinho18,My number 142 movie ( contains story + spoilers ),8,30 January 2001,"Scream 2 is my number 142 movie. It is a good, but ridiculous, horror flick. I think that part 2 is the worst of the Scream-series, but nevertheless good. I can understand why someone dislikes this movie, because the characters sometimes act very stupid ( e.g. the car crash - if you have seen the film ). The story : While watching Stab"" ( which deals with the incidents of Scream"" ) two people are killed. The police has not any suspicion, because everyone wears those Stab""-dress. The next day Sidney Prescott ( Neve Campbell ) is frightened because she gets a phone call by  the killer ( the killers ??? ). During the following days many people are killed by the murderer / murderers. In the end Sidney Prescott and the TV-correspondent Gale Weathers ( Courteney Cox ) meet the killer/s in the auditorium of the school. The final showdown begins....I have to admit that I usually like all horror films, and this one is no exception. Although it is one of the more ridiculous ones, it is nevertheless scary. The actors are quite bad. It exaggerates in the end. If you try to keep yourself a secret from everybody ( by wearing a mask ) , you do not take your mass off voluntarily, do you ?!? But that is the same as in Scream 1 and Scream 3. Question #1: Why did Sidney and her friend not take the mask of the guy in the car, who is unconsciously. Question #2 : How is it possible to sound one´s horn if you try to take the mask of the guy ?Question #3 : The killers kill everyone almost as fast as possible, right ? But why do they make a sensation with killing Sidney ? She is their main-victim, but they just do not want to kill her ? WHY ?????This is definitely not one of the best horror movies. But it is a good one.All in all, I rated this movie 8/10 and recommend it to fans of horror films or to fans of the Scream-series ( of course ). I am pretty lucky that a film ( Scary Movie"" ) made fun of these horror movies. If you have any questions, feel free to ask them.",Scream 2

The story-line is good and I really enjoyed it. Although I didn't find it scary, one scene made me jump out of my skin, and I think it had it's desired effect. I still don't really see why these films have an 18 rating, as I really don't think they're that bad. I will say that when I found out who the killer was I was veeeeeeeeery shocked and I didn't expect it at all! Overall I would say that Scream 2 is a good film with some tiny scares, but with an overall comedy feel to it (especially with all the hideous nineties clothes!). I would give it 8/10 and say that it is suitable for anyone 14+.",Scream 2

I think the actors did a very good job in this movie and a very good story MUCH stronger then scream 3 storyline this is one year i think after the first one and sidney is still freaking out like she thinks the killer is her boyfriend cause thats what happned in the first one and what happens to her boyfriend BOOM!! he gets shot while being tied up on that platform i think Cotton wiery played a big role in this movie helping everyone out ALOT! I think he eared sidney's trust  by the end of this movie some people die well duh i mean some major people die like RANDY but he came back in scream 3(on videotape) and helped sidney and friends out by explaining ""the rules"" All i have to say about this movie VERY GORY VERY BLOODY VERY GOOD!!!!!!!

Definite recommendation for all.,Scream 2
206,c_p_c,Another Round of all the Screams!!!,6,23 April 2003,"It is hard to avoid the fact that Scream 2 is a lot like the first one, same plot line, different setting, victims, and of course killers.That being said, this is not a bad movie.  If you enjoyed the first one, you will like this one just as well.  The body count is a little higher in this movie and of course everything is a little drawn out,as sequels tend to do. However, the clever acting, dialogue, and scary scenes are all still there. Craven and his team deserve a little respect for making a decent addition to the horror genre and not screwing up what the original SCREAM had going.A little more exaggerated, but still filled with plenty of screams, SCREAM 2 rates a 6/10",Scream 2
207,mbworm,"Cool, fast and scary, but a notch down from the first",7,6 October 2006,"If you followed Wes Craven's ""Scream"" intently, there's no denying you'll be craving for more of the originality and unpredictability that made it such a hit. And although ""Scream 2"" is down a notch on that scale, it still hits the mark quite effectively and turns out as a fast, slick and brutal sequel that is high above your average slasher fare.Sydney(Neve Campbell, a little better acting here) is the likable, sweet heroine from the first story, in which her boyfriend and a friend were terrorizing high school students because of Sydney's dark past, which is dwelled upon in all three ""Scream"" films. She has moved on to a remote Ohio college, where she is now studying to be an actress. Paranoid and traumatized, Sydney is thrown back into the nightmare when scary murders begin plaguing the peaceful campus. One by one, her friends begin to get picked off by the angry killer in the ""ghost face"" suit that has made these movies a landmark in horror history. A bit clichéd and a bit less predictable, this ""Scream"" is still a worthy horror film and stands on its own, whereas most sequels fail miserably. David Arquette and Courteney Cox (from ""Friends"" and previous ""Scream"" fame) get thrown in the mix as well, reprising their hilarious roles and on screen romance as an ambitious cop and a bitchy reporter who survived but are stalked once more alongside Sydney. Kevin Williamson and Wes Craven conjure up another awesome scarefest and the deaths are relentless and creative up to the satisfying conclusion. As aforementioned, it's all not as tense or dark as the first. But it gets points for taking on a more serious tone and keeping the murderer well shadowed until the surprising unveiling. Good acting from the supporting cast and all around good editing make Scream 2 a hit. Great bloody and humorous fun. Unique and scary, 7 out of 10.",Scream 2
208,Car316,I'll say it...better than the original.,10,23 January 2001,"In my opinion this sequel to the entertaining original is even better. I felt it had a little more energy. I also felt that the characters of Gale, Dewey and Randy were better developed. The suspense was just as high. The Mystery behind the identity of the killer was also just as interesting. The movie is just a whole lot of fun. Overall a great sequel, even better than the original. ***1/2 (out of four)",Scream 2
209,tarzan61,Worthy Sequel,9,20 October 2005,"Scream 2 lives up to the original and delivers just what we want. The blood spills everywhere, the question of who it is remains intact yet again. (You won't guess who it is) Dewey is trying to be Mr. Cool now, rather than some Keystone Cop, and now he wants some Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox)! Sydney is really to fight again, and she gets the chance. Gale's new cameraman is a black dude who knows that brothers never survive so he books it. Cotton, the man Sydney accused of killing her mother, pops up. He wants to get his innocence spread around with a TV special. And then there's good ol' Ghostface, with his mean calls and enlongated mask. Good times. Once again, a blonde with noting important to the plot dies.So there you are, another romp in slasher tribute and lotsa blood. Just as good as the first and crying for attention. Get this one too.",Scream 2
210,ARTaylor,Exception to the Sequel Rule,10,16 October 2012,"In one early scene, Randy claims that sequels are inherently inferior. The characters then list several examples of sequels that have matched and possibly surpassed the original. And Scream 2 ranks among them.Scream 1 was great. I gave it a wonderful review. But somehow, Scream 2 managed to do it all better. The suspense is greater, the kills gorier, the laughs funnier, and cast better.With Scream 1 having been made into a movie within the movie, Sydney and the other survivors are all trying to move on with her and Randy in college finding new friends and loves. They're reunited when the killings begin again as someone sets out to make a sequel. A new setting means new rules with some twists and turns along the way.Just as before, we have no idea who the killer(s) is until the final act. We get the same kind of false leads and misdirect, such as people being gone at Ghostface's appearances and wearing the same boots as the killer. Once the identity(ies) is revealed, it's great to go back and see how the person(s) manipulated events without the mask. SPOILER Mickey's motivation works well within the movie. Ms. Loomis' also works well, but I don't like that they never really built her up. She comes out of nowhere with little basis before the finale. END SPOILERThe cast are all wonderful. Neve Campbell shows a great progression in her character, and of the four movies this is the one I think she's sexiest in. Cox, Arquette, and Kennedy all return as wonderful as before. O'Connell, Gellar, Schreiber, and Neal are great in new, or at least expanded, roles. None of them are merely copies from the first movie. Though it's Kennedy and Olyphant steal every scene they're in, much like Randy and Stu did in the first. Their dialog together is great, especially as they keep referring to various sequels. At least none of them look quite as ""evil"" as Billy did.Of course, being a horror movie it's the scares that are really matters. The suspense is built up much better than the first. The scene where Sydney must escape the cop car is probably the most suspenseful in the entire series, maybe in the genre. The movie also plays on the fact that audiences know the standards set by the original.Scream 2 is definitely on par with the original, and in my opinion the best of the series. This is definitely a must-see for fans of the original and of horror. There's really nothing to disappoint here. It may share the same general story as the original, but like Terminator 2 it adds enough to be its own experience.",Scream 2
211,Chris-332,"Funfilled and clever, but a couple mistakes.",8,5 February 2000,"When I first saw Scream 2 I thought that it was way better than the first one. Then when I saw it a couple more times, I noticed the problems of the movie. Although the script is as fresh with its characters and dialogue, some scenes in the movie are very predictable. It wasn't scary at all. The main killer at the end was stupid, I admit that. I loved the first killer that you found out about, as well as his/her motive. But then the movie introduced the partner, who turned out to be the main killer. It was really stupid. They cast the wrong person for it, and it just didn't work in many respects.Now, with the problems out of the way, I can tell you about the good things about the movie. I absolutely loved the whole idea of Stab in this movie. It created something totally different in the new movie world. For those of you who have not seen the movie, Stab is a movie-within a-movie based on the events in the first Scream. Tori Spelling plays Sidney, David Schwimmer plays Dewey, etc... It was very clever. It was also just as funny as the first one, and I was roaring with laughter during the scene when Dewey sees Gale and has a little talk about her book. Jamie Kennedy was in the spotlight for most of the film, and he did just as good a performance as Randy as he did in the first one. The whole cast of new people fit the Scream team very well, especially Jerry O'Connell, Sid's new boyfriend away at college.So, all in all, the movie was very good despite its weak ending and its sometimes predictable storyline. I used to think it was the best Scream, but the more I think about it, the more it's the worst one. It still is very good, though, and is a worthwhile and worthy follow-up to the greatest horror movie of the 1990's.",Scream 2

214,timefreezer7,You have to have a sequel !!!,8,5 June 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** ... as Stew said in the original Scream . This movie was a complete story by its own . But after the success of Scream the continuation chapters were inevitable . Although Scream 2 obviously does not compare with the first part it has some major improvements . The first is that the plot unfolds much more continuusly than the first. There is not an inch of dead time since the non action scenes are used for the dramatic development of the characters like the theater scenes . In Scream the parts where Sidney (Neve Campbell) was whining about her mother were kind of annoying . Also Jamie Kennedy was kind of irritating as Randy the last time . Here he is more mature and reliable without overacting and screaming . Also (thank God) there are less quotes from other movies just the necessary amount .PLOT : 2 years after the gruesome murders in Woodsborow the events of Scream were made a movie called ""Stab"" based on the best seller book by the reporter Gail Weathers (Corteney Cox) . During the avant premiere a gory murder takes place in the most tragic way ( I won 't say more than this is better than the Drew Barrymore opening!!) Soon it becomes clear that a psychopath has decided to be the successor of the killer in Stab and has focused on the University campus where Sidney and Randy are now students . He is a copycat killer following precisely the same methods . The threatening phone calls , the black costume with the ghostface mask and the knife-using bloody slasher killings. Gail Weathers arrives on the scene to help the police and fulfil her own ambitions as well . The story is very good and the cast reunion is effective. The psychological horror is once again inherent : the maniac can be literally anyone . An obsessed movie fan who sadistically wants to poke his fun to Sidney by reviving her worst nightmares . It is very chilling since most of us have suppressed fears and subconciously always live in the sheer terror they might resurrect . Apart this psychological factor the writer made sure to give a motive almost to everyone . Even the most unconfessed motives are apparent . For example Dewey (David Arquette) and Randy are never exposed for their possible obscure motives but anyone with a common sense of logic can guess their motives for being the killers . Despite a few original scenes there are more chliches than the last time , unfortunately . E.g. Cicy is a supporting cast so you know she doesn 't stand a chance to live . The trapped in the car scene no matter how suspensful , it is contrived and very stupid . And finally the ending : the biggest flaw is that the killer 's motive is stupid or even better inexistant . There is a shocking revelation but it does not compensate for the bad taste the ending leaves us . It is not only disappointing but it is unrealistic and , even worse , not suspenseful. As soon as the killer is unmasked the agony freezes . In Scream that point was simply the beginning for the edge-of-your-seat climax .I will have to warn you though that the fault is not the writer 's , at least totally . Kevin Williamson 's original draft is rumoured to be darker , had a different killer and better ending with a cliffhanger to be answered in #3 (it is obvious the obsession of Williamson with the Star Wars trilogy) . Probably the director or the producers changed it for PC reasons . Overall Scream 2 is a good sequel . It is worth seeing to keep up with the story . It has some good scenes but it is utterly destroyed by the ending . Bewarned . I haven 't seen Scream 3 but I hope it will restore the memory of the series .SCREAM II          7.5 / 10",Scream 2

Let's review what I consider to be the top five continuity problems / unlikely occurrences from Scream 2.5.  Cici's fall from the balcony is inconsistent with the way she is thrown.4.  Sidney and Halle switch places in the car.3.  Seven major characters just happen to find themselves in the same place for the film's climax (Sidney, Gail, Dewey, Debbie Salt, Mickey, Cotton, and Derek).2.  While the climax definitely takes place at night, the very end of the movie, which we are made to believe occurs right after the climax, appears to be happening at noon.1.  The killer is apparently clairvoyant and/or psychic.And yet I like the movie (and the other two - which are also flawed in such ways) anyway.  In truth, I let the Scream movies get away with more than any other series of movies out there.  This is partly because all three have their share of clever moments, but I think it's also because I'm not sure how many of the problems are intentional.

One of the big things from the original scream was the constant horror movie references and it's a huge part of what makes the film so enjoyable. Scream 2 is the same.The guessing game is back again and done just as well as the first.Much like the first there are some very memorable scenes. The car scene is great along with the film class scene.Acting is very good also.Characters are very fun and enjoyable.Negative:
A lot of it is identical to the first. Which is bad for a couple of reasons. Makes it predictable.Killers motives and personalities were identical to the first.Fake out deaths were one too many and the other cast same as the first.A lot more dumb character moments in this but I mean I expect that so it's not a huge deal.Another not huge deal ghost face is very clumsy but Sydney would be dead very quickly if not.Critical score 7/10Enjoyment score 8.5/10.",Scream 2
220,TruPretender,"...2, the ""Back For More"" movie.",5,25 October 2005,"...And the audience was desperate for a sequel! Yep, the inevitable was near, so near it was a only a single year after the original ""Scream"" that we saw a continuation of the Wes Craven movie that spawned a huge following. This film did nothing more than take the first film to a new and alleged stereotypical setting that would be ground zero for another slasher story. I can say, however, that this film was, in event, actually better than its procedure. I guess most sequels sometimes feel more intriguing than the originals, but only to an extent. The feeling is usually only a left-over sentiment from the original winning a fans heart. In ""Scream 2"", there is both, a sentiment, and excitement that runs along the entire film. Better yet, the first film may as well not even exist, seeing as Kevin Williamson made quite sure that any pre-requisite films need not apply this time around. You hear so much about the first one, why even bother watching? All you get is twice the gore, twice the cheese, and all that goofy Williamson dialog, fit with cheap so-called innovation.This time, we have a new movie opening up appropriately titled 'Stab'. A hot'n'happening college couple are out on a date to inspect it, or rather, he is, she should be back in the dorm studying. At any rate, trouble ensues when the culture-oriented colleagues become the hot topic of the following morning news.Yes, a second killer is here, and Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) cannot help but feel that somehow, it is all her fault. If this is incorrect, than Campbell gives off the wrong signals all throughout the film. Anyway, the public media creates a frenzy at a nice little college where Campbell and Kennedy from the first, now reside. Guess who else in back...Gale Weathers! Yes, the convenient 'Stab' franchise is based on none other, than the ""Scream"" original caper itself! How Very! (or not!). David Arguette also comes back as the laid-back, humble cop Dewey. We get to see more of Kennedys' rambling about supposed pop- culture sequels such as ""Aliens"" . We also receive information about slasher movies located at a college campus. We learn of ""House On Sorority Row"", ""The Dorm that Dripped Blood"", even a little bit about ""Showgirls"". How fun! In any case, blood baths return, as well as more predictability and that 'lingo' issue Williamson had with the first one.Arquette, Campbell, and Cox are well on target, keeping their characters up to par with the original formality they began with. Kennedys ""Randy"" is more intellectual, and given the treatment of a saint...and for what? All he does is sit side and give his own commentary about sequels and trilogies. How original...right! Perhaps if he was not such a film geek before... Other cast members are fun to watch. Jerry O'Connel, Timothy Olephant, and Rebecca Gayheart are nice and steady. A real joker about this, is the disgustingly goofy way that Sarah Michelle Gellar has a bit part as a typical sorority girl on campus. Please...it was enough in ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"" also written by Williamson, but I remember finding out she was in this after ""Summer"" and thinking it was pretty ridiculous. There is, however, a performance that stands out major from the rest of the cast, and the award for best actor/actress in this installment goes to Laurie Metcalf, for a great comeback into film, as well as all the little manifestations she creates.The writing is slightly better than the original, and obviously so, as the first one was the starting point for all this madness and violence. The issue of extreme language and convenient movie knowledge still present, only this time, we have a full classroom of film studies, where everyone is just like Kennedys' ""Randy"". Williamson is too enthralled to slow the pace, and thusly the story is quick and sharp, if sometimes repetitive and lacking. I suppose it is likely that Williamson reached a certain status of narcissism with the success of the first film. It is all too fake by the end. Some of the dialog is just as hammy as Thanksgiving dinner. Albeit entertaining.Wes Craven gives his usual storytelling in genius fashion, but the impact on pop-culture is still all to shocking to believe. We still have the same direction as the first, with no real end of the tunnel. New back stories and twists may come off as new direction for the story,but for the most part, it just says the same old thing over and over again. Maybe by ""Scream 3""...",Scream 2
221,fofml,Good sequel,7,8 November 2000,"You know what they say about sequels... they are never as good as the original. But that discussion is also in the movie, proving that some sequels are even better than the original movie, like The Godfather 2. I say Scream 2 is a great sequel but not better than the original. It's not worse either. There are 2 things I like the most about this movie:1.) Gale Weathers. Courteney Cox has created an unique character which is very different from Friends' Monica and she is very good in both parts. Gale is very sassy and even bitchy at times but even tough she is all that you still hope she'll make it. She's definitely the character I enjoyed the most in all the Scream movies.Sorry, but number 2 contains a HUGE spoiler, you shouldn't read on if you haven't seen the movie yet. You have been warned.2.)The killers. Well, actually just Laurie Metcalf. I mean the other guy wasn't bad or anything,but he wasn't such a big surprise. But Laurie Metcalf? When the movie began and we met her character I thought, ""hey, that's Jackie, ""Rosanne's"" sister!"" Then I thought it was too bad her character in Scream 2 is very similar to Jackie. She seemed really typecast. Her character seems insecure, not self-confident and you first think the only reason she appears in this movie is that Gale Weathers has got an ideal victim for her smart one-liners. You think her purpose is to get some laughs. But in the end, you notice she is anything but ""Jackie"", she is one big psycho!!! Congratulations to the casting people and producers, that was a very clever move and I think very little people could tell she was the murderer. I loved this surprising ending!!!!",Scream 2

I thought the film was good because at the beginning 2 people are watching Stab(a film based on Woodsboro murders)when the real killer, instead of fake ones in the theater, murders them and calmly leaves blaming lots of innocent people who didn't know that the killer was in the same room as they are in. But now Sydney is in college and loving it. And is trying to get over the murders from the previous film and lives nearby Dewey's home with a big security system. I personally thought that when Ghost-face had them in the police car I thought that he would crash the car resulting in everyone inside dying suddenly upon impact. But I was scared to death when Sydney was making her way out of the car window(as in the front driver's window the only exit). I was holding my breath when she crawled out and stared down the killer who was temporarily knocked unconscious. For at least five minutes or so. Until he gets out mysteriously and kills Sydney's friend right in front of her. I was scared to death when Cotton was deciding whether or not to kill Sydney or let her live. I was like ""let her live please, the mother is crazy, kill her, not her!"" I was holding my breath when he had finally decided to let her live and kill the mom instead. Because he had forgiven her and thought that she had deserved to live instead of the crazy mom breathing down her neck.",Scream 2

I didn't rate Scream 2 highly the first time and this repeat viewing several months later didn't change my mind.SPOILERS AHEAD, DON'T READ IF YOU HAVEN'T WATCHED Scream 2.The female killer character's numerous appearances never fit into the feel of the rest of the film, she stands out like a sore thumb in all her scenes and may as well be wearing a ""I'm the killer"" badge.I found myself laughing out loud when Sidney decides to run to a dark and empty theatre calling out ""is there anybody there?"".

228,very_doubtful,So many flaws it is surprising that the film is still enjoyable (!SPOILERS FOR SCREAM 1&2!),6,20 April 2000,"What'd I expect? I mean, Scream was absolutely outstanding. It combined suspense, fun and originality in a never-before-seen way. To come up with a sequel that is better than Scream is a mission: impossible. I was aware and prepared that Scream 2 wouldn't beat the original. But still I was fairly disappointed. Scream 2 had almost none of the cleverness and wit that made its predecessor so originally entertaining. In addition, it changed the characteristics of some of the persons from the first one which was very confusing.The story was basically a repetition of the first Scream (which isn't that tragic) but with less twists and surprises in it. In Scream we had the time to get to know all the important characters including the killers but it still wasn't easy to guess the killer right. In the end there was this unique experience: ""Oh, of course it was them, why didn't I realize this earlier?!"". When I watched the film again I had to admit that everything perfectly fit. Scream 2 totally failed in this point. The reason why it was almost impossible to figure out who the killers were, is that they had nearly no screentime until the very end. It could as well have been Norman Bates or Santa Claus. It is very easy to hide the killers by not showing them at all.But nonetheless, Scream 2 had some pretty cool scenes. The opening scene in the movie-theatre at a sneak preview of ""Stab"" (a movie based on the events at Woodsboro in Scream) was excellent. Like in the original Scream it was very cruel, sadistic and maybe even more inventive. It didn't have the same impact one me though. This scene left me hoping for more. Another exciting scene includes Randy, Dewey and Gale Weathers standing on the lawn of the college. They get a call from the killer who is able to see them. They run around trying to find him/her even attacking some students. But then, in my opinion, Williamson made a big mistake by killing Randy. His death in the very same scene deeply disturbed me. Not because it was too cruel or anything like that. There was just something wrong with it, I thought he was the wrong person to get killed and that he should be among the survivors. They'd rather have killed Sidney Prescott, that would have surprised everybody and made this series unique! (Remember Randy: ""I'd let the geek kill the girl."")One more good scene that comes to my mind was the one in the sound studio which was very thrilling. Dewey is trying to call Gale through the soundproof pane when the killer is attacking him from behind. That was very clever. But again I have a small complaint: What does it need to kill Dewey? A nuclear bomb? Normally the lunatics are the ones that are (almost) immortal but no matter how much he gets stabbed, he doesn't die!There are some very illogical scenes too, for instance when Sidney first runs away from the car, then decides to go back to see who the killer is. And the two agents that are supposed to protect Sidney: Were they on the drugs? My grandmother moves faster than these two did, and believe me, my grandmother is not that young anymore!The irony that made Scream so amusing is reduced to a minimum in this sequel. The discussion about sequels was nice to watch but other than that...almost nothing. Why did they eliminate one of the most important elements? Instead we see all sorts of persons having all sorts of psychological problems. Sidney is still suffering from what happened to her at Woodsboro. Her boyfriend is not that happy either because his relationship to Sidney is starting to fall apart. Dewey has become a complete ghost. That kind of naive touch that he used to have made him the most enjoyable person in the first film. And Gale Weathers now feels alone and abandoned (*sniff*). Even the dead people are not happy. It seems as if all the persons have been replaced by emotionless robots. Especially Dewey has lost all his charm. The whole film is more like a psychological drama than a teen-horror slasher and that is not what I was hoping for.If Craven had deleted some scenes, the movie wouldn't be that boring either. Some elements are weird, some are boring and others are weird and boring at the same time. Sidney belongs to a theatre group. I guess it was supposed to make Sidney look more like a real person but in fact it just slows down the film. And I didn't quite understand the point of Sidney's boyfriend being ""abducted"" by some freaked teens. I think it was only used to explain why he appeared in the final scene.Let's face it: Stu and Billy were not that agile. But in Scream 2 the killer simply runs into every single obstacle. I wasn't quite sure if he wasn't even blind. I found myself laughing at him several times, especially when he followed Cici (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and stumbled over the couch etc..But despite of all these flaws mentioned above the film still could have been far above average. But they decided to shoot one of the most pointless and boring endings in movie history. Mickey was quite a good psycho but Debbie Salt aka the mother of Billy was about as frightening as a banana. Laurie Metcalf tried to pull off some kind of Mrs. Voorhees-thing but she is so implausible that it gets ridiculous. Scream 2 turned out to be one of the only films in horror history to end with a shoot-out, not very scary either...Don't get me wrong. Scream 2 is still one of the best films in this newly discovered genre (teen slasher). It's just way worse than the original. It is illogical and boring at places. But overall it is still enjoyable and provides decent entertainment (except for the ending).My rating: 6/10",Scream 2

230,Mileskolehmainen,Slightly better than the original,9,10 November 2014,"I am very surprised at the three star rating on here. Rotten Tomatoes (a website that's not a fan of sequels) gave this a (slightly) better rating than the first (Scream: 78%, Scream 2: 81%, it's not much but still.) This is a sequel that won't disappoint, it's still very clever, and a tad better than the original. The characters, new ones and survivors, are well acted and likable. The scares and chase scenes are very effective, and I'm sure you will find yourself at the edge of your seat in many scenes, and you're gonna jump a lot too. The script is pretty great also. The twist (and the rest of the film too) pack many surprises. So, if you haven't seen Scream 2, and are a fan of the first Scream, I recommend this movie to you. 8.8/10 (P.S. don't look at the IMDb page for Scream 3 if you haven't seen this one, it will (obviously) tell you who survives this movie)",Scream 2

Scream 2 tries to do what the original did which was to come up with a fantastic and shocking opening, now while i like the idea of the killer sat amongst people wearing the same outfit i did not think the opening was quite as good as the originals.The death scenes are a bit more gorier but very predictable. Something i don't always like in the script is that the killer always seems to fall down or seems to be clumsy, which is something i don't like because i think it becomes stupid and predictable.Kevin Williams script offers new characters, new settings but nothing much more than that. Having seen the first you know or you can best guess that there will be two killers, one you may probably expect the other was a shock for me but a super ending and a better one to what Williams had originally written.Wes Craven shows just why he's the master of suspense and horror by giving a good second helping of the Scream pie.Worth the watch but don't be surprised by the predictable deaths.",Scream 2

233,rickypeters-49138,Probably the Best in the Series,10,7 March 2019,"Scream was a phenomenon and a sequel seemed inevitable. Unlike most slashers franchises, however, it seems that the Scream franchise has something new to say. While the first film was a commentary on horror fandom, Scream 2 mostly ditches that in favor of the celebrity of murderers, copycats, revenge, and the expectations of a Hollywood sequel.Never does Scream 2 feel cloying and cutesy and, in fact, I'd say it has more guts than its predecessor. The film loves subverting expectations at every turn, kills off beloved characters with malicious glee, keeps our leads in constant danger, and actually manages to continue developing the survivors from the first film. In most sequels, if a surviving character returns, they're rendered more or less catatonic (Halloween II) or they're killed off in the opening minutes of the film.Wes Craven proves once again that he's a master of suspense with a few genuinely nail biting sequences that might just be the best of his career.Don't be fooled - Scream 2 is way better than you'd ever imagine it would be and well worthy of your time.",Scream 2
234,troutman,Good Sequel,8,24 April 1999,"While watching Scream 2 it is hard to tell whether or not it is better than the original or not.The ending of the first film was certainly better and the way that the ending of this film is set up is really disappointing.The revelation about the killers in the end of the film is sort of disappointing. One of the killers motives is obvious and ties in well with the first film the other killers identity just does not make sense though serves the message of the film about blaming film violence for real acts of violence.The death scenes are good and the acting mostly is great. The women in this film are hotter in this than the first which always helps. Overall in the Scream series - the first one worked better in the cinema, the second works better on video.",Scream 2
235,Adec,A solid sequel...,8,16 August 1999,"I really enjoyed the first Scream film, in fact I'd go so far as to rate it as a modern horror classic, so I was hoping that this film would be all that it's forerunner was, and would be another thrilling, knowing, well structured horror chiller...and for the most part it achieves this, although that said it definitely lacks some of the originality and class of the original.Scream 2 has it's share of tense scenes and well paced scares, and is again helmed with edgy style by Wes Craven, but similar to a discussion by actors David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy in the film, it fails to be bigger, badder and scarier than the first film, despite it's best efforts to deliver to the contrary.Perhaps it's just a case of the original working so well that this fails to match up in comparison, as it's still definitely one of the best chillers to come out in quite some time, (and far superior to most modern efforts) and it does have a good twist ending that works well...although it must be said it isn't as convincing as the original films twist was, but there's just something about Scream 2 that feels slightly by the numbers.
Then again maybe it's down to the fact that this film was made so soon after the original, or that almost no matter what this film tries it can't match the freshness and originality that the first one had going for it. Or maybe it's the fact that the first film basically came out of nowhere to impress while this one has a stylish parentage to live up to that brings about the feeling that it isn't as satisfying as it should be, but whatever it is that feeling of ""almost, but not quite"" definitely comes into play.The acting for the most part is well done, with Neve Campbell once again providing a very solid lead, ably supported by the likes of returning players Courteney Cox, Jamie Kennedy, Liev Schreiber and new faces Sarah Michelle Gellar, Timothy Olyphant, Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Elise Neal and Heather Graham all fun in their various roles. However it's not all acting joy as Jerry O'Connell and David Arquette both seem to sleep through their roles, while Laurie Metcalf goes a little too far over the top in her role to be totally convincing. But even so there aren't any real embarrassments performance wise here to speak of, and for the most part everyone works quite well in their respective roles.As mentioned above Wes Craven does another very classy job of directing here, and while at times Kevin Williamson's script seems to be trying a little too hard, for the most part it's well written and paced, as is the film that it's based on.Maybe I'm being too critical, as the film based on it's own merits is still a darn good watch, but I just couldn't shake that ever so slight feeling of disappointment. Still that said Scream 2 is a very enjoyable horror film, and just so long as you don't go in expecting it to be all the original was you should have a pretty good time here.One man's opinion. 8/10",Scream 2
236,Brian Blueskye,CAN IT BE ANY MORE PREDICTABLE ?,1,16 September 1999,"Wow, this time Wes Craven really gave away who the killer was. If you can't figure it out in the first 30 minutes, there is something wrong with you.
One thing I like about these ""Cast now in college"" movies is that they try to continue the series, with 2 or 3 people of the same cast in the same college, with new characters. This movie is nothing but a wannabe horror version of House Party 2. The movie is just lame, boring, and the killer is obvious too soon, and it's obvious what is going to happen next in the movie.",Scream 2

241,pieschel,Meet back up with the Woodsboro gang for a wilder ride!,6,6 July 2000,"When I say wild, I mean much, much wilder. The killing is about doubled and the killer is showing little mercy. Even though this movie did not please people as much as its prequel, its still fun to watch and the only living characters from Scream are guaranteed to please you yet again. The acting is no different then that in Scream, but the appearances differ. The movie doesn't have much of a plot but you don't care very much once you start watching it. Most of the killing is senseless and the characters are not always smart in what they do in these horrific situations. I might make Scream 2 sound bad, but it really isn't that horrible. This is one of those movies that you either really like or you really hate.",Scream 2
242,Chandlergellar,"Its time to ""Scream"" for a second time!",9,1 August 2005,"Although i did really enjoy ""Scream 2"" i feel that it didn't have the same spark as the first one. The surviving cast Members return, Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, David Arquette and Jamie Kennedy, as well as being joined by new people Jade Pinkett (smith), Sarah Michelle 'Buffy' Gellar, Jerry O Connel and Elise Neal. The film starts with another Scary opener and its with Jada Pinkett and her boyfriend waiting to see ""Stab"", its a movie based on the murders that happened in Woodsboro a year earlier, but not much to their knowledge their life will be a scary movie in the movie theatre, In the film ""Stab"" they are watching Heather Graham is re acting Drew Barrymores performance as Casey Becker. Jada is playing Maureen Evans a bright young Women and hates scary movies. after her boyfriend is killed hes after her but the audience think thats its a funny stunt, but it turns out not to be funny at all when she dies in front of 200 people. When than see a familiar face Sidney Prescott, shes now at college with her new best friend Hallie played by Elise Neal and now Sid discovers its happening all over again. We than get introduced to Sidneys new Boyfriend Derek played by Jerry O Connel and too Woodsboro survivors Dewey and Randy. suddenly out of no where Courtney Cox is back as Gail Weathers and she brought along Cotten Weary because she wants Sidney to talk about what happened the year before, Sid is not happy and walks away. The next scene is about a young blonde Girl named Casey ""CICI"" Cooper played by the ever sexy Sarah Michelle Gellar. She is alone because shes waiting to pick up her drunk Friends from a party. She is talking to her Friend on the phone when someone is beeping in, its the killer and she starts being harassed just like Casey Becker in ""Scream"", Gellar was outstanding in this movie as every other thing she does but I'm a huge fan of her work and everything that she does (Buffy, i know what you did last summer) and i was pleased that she was in this movie. after the killer adds her to his death list, he is after Sidney and she is attacked at a party while everyone has gone to investigate the murder of Cici. than her boyfriend goes after the killer and is than put up as a suspect. basically Mrs Loomis has come after Sidney because she killed Billy and she has a student helping her with the murders. with help from Gail and Cotten, everything turns out to be fine! plus the Killer is killing people with similar names to the original victims which gives the film a brilliant twist. although this wasn't as good, it still is one of my favs!three cheers for: Neve Campbell- Always brilliant in these films! Sarah Michelle Gellar- shes amazing in everything that she does and I'm her biggest fan plus shes HOT in this film Courtney Cox- proved once again that she can play other roles and not be Monica all the time.David Arquette was AWFUL! i don't know why they don't kill him off, he is a terrible actor and the the way he ""Walks"" because of his stab wound from the last movie makes him look even worse of an actor.anyway like i said 9/10! its worth seeing over and over again!amazing camera work from Wes Craven, he truly is the suspense master!!",Scream 2
243,laika-lives,"Not Quite The Godfather Part 2, But...",9,7 April 2006,"'Scream 2' is one of those films that seems to have suffered most from the backlash against the knowing, self-referential horror films of the late nineties. Not only is it the sequel to the film that started the whole movement ('Wes Craven's New Nightmare' notwithstanding), but it carries the postmodernist game-playing to a new level. Horror purists loathed it for being populist and 'ironic', critics hated slasher movies on principle, and the larger audience were suffering from in-joke fatigue by the time they saw it. So unfortunately, nobody notices that not only is it a better film than the one it succeeds, it's probably the best horror film of the period.The opening sequence is particularly striking. Everything that made the original's celebrated opening sequence so iconic is either subverted or built upon. So again, a young woman and her boyfriend are stalked and murdered, but this time it plays out in a crowded cinema (showing a tacky reinterpretation of the original, just to reinforce the connection). Where the horror used to be in isolation, it is now found in alienation - the nightmare of dying in front of hundreds of people and nobody lifting a finger to help you is particularly potent. The iconography of ghost-face is played upon here too, not only in the film-within-a-film but the masks members of the audience wear. Given that the film seems to be a refutation of the old 'violent movies cause violence' argument (Sarah Michelle Gellar's character acts as the voice of sanity, Timothy Olyphant's character parodies what Wes Craven clearly considers the voice of insanity), it's striking that in this opening sequence the audience is seen as partly culpable for the murder. The moment when a bleeding Jada Pinkett-Smith cries out on stage, framed by the projection of ghost-face's mask (and bleached out by the white light, an interesting visual cue back to the debate over black characters in horror films that opens the film), and the baying audience subside in uneasy realisation, is one of the most indelible images in a horror film I've ever seen, and a slap in the face for the (real) audience, who have come to the cinema in order to see people get sliced up, after all. It takes a brave movie to implicate its viewers before the film has really got going, and certainly underlines the fact that this is neither a dumb slasher flick or a cheap cash-in on the success of the original.The potency of the death of this character we have only spent a few minutes in the company of illustrates something else about 'Scream 2' (and 'Scream', for that matter) - that, despite the repeated use of the word by lazy magazine and newspaper critics who ought to know better, they are not 'ironic'. No wonder Kevin Williams turned the definition of the word into a running joke in his later script 'Teaching Mrs Tingle'; he must have been sick of the misallocation of the word in almost every review he read. It implies a style that contrasts the apparent and actual meaning of situations and dialogue. Irony in this sense undercuts what we are being shown and what the characters experience, usually turning it into bathos. There is no irony in the deaths of the characters in 'Scream 2', unlike 'Final Destination 2', for instance, where characters being sliced into pieces by a flying wire fence or crushed by a falling pane of glass are both moments of horror and moments of humour. In contrast, when Hallie buys it so soon after surviving the film's most excruciating suspense sequence, it's horrific because she's a likable, funny character who doesn't deserve to die. The audience responds to the characters on an emotional level, mainly because of Williams's unfairly uncelebrated skill at creating three-dimensional characters in just a handful of scenes (compare with 'Scream 3', scripted by Ehren Kruger, where only Parker Posey's self-obsessed film star stands out), but also because of the skills of an above average cast (particularly Courtney Cox-Arquette, Jamie Kennedy and Liev Schreiber - although frankly Laurie Metcalf calmly pockets the entire movie in a single scene. Compare also Neve Campbell's likable, determined Sidney with Jennifer Love Hewitt's Julie Jameson in the 'I Know What You Did Last Summer' films - a drip written (initially by Williams, irritatingly) and acted with half the skill, who constantly needs rescuing by her boyfriend as though she were the heroine of a Victorian melodrama). These are not the corpses-in-waiting of most slasher films, but funny, rounded individuals with their own foibles who die senselessly and horribly. The humour (and it is a very, very funny movie) is not at the expense of the horror, or the characters enduring it. It's also worth noting the real skill with which Craven orchestrates the suspense, the excellent use of music (particularly some borrowed from the 'Broken Arrow' score), Tori Spelling's gameness (although she gives away the plot twist of 'Stab' in that interview!), and Portia di Rossi's remarkable eyebrows. This movie needs serious re-assessment. Personally, I think it's richer than your average horror-snob's favourite.",Scream 2
244,enjoyuk,"Highly glossy, highly trashy",2,25 September 1999,"Scream 2 is a poor movie, honestly!.  I must admit I wasnt a big fan of the first one, and I didnt expect too much of the second.  You would think that all the ""SMART"" pretty young things, who spout off all the way through the film their knowledge of horror movies, would simply leave town for couple of weeks until the murderer was captured.  The Killer in the Scream series must be the biggest joke going, for all the amazing things he does like chasing down police cars and killing two armed cops, you would think that he would be able to chase someone through a house without clumsily tripping up over everything and anything.  Scary, my arse. I spent the best part of eight years in the states, and I never met anyone as irritating and as annoying there as the college kids in this movie, I was practically shouting for the killer as he bumped off this annoying lot.Here are are few questions that have been floating around my mind since subjecting myself to Scream 2: Is Dewey related to Michael Myers? You can stab him 1500 times and he still survives at the end.Why does the killer always turn into some third-rate comedian when unmasked? and then really emphasise the word ""F**k"" when speaking.Why does Wes Craven never have a likeable character in any of his movies?Is there any overweight or normal looking people at Sydney's College?WHAT the hell was that terrible, terrible music all about that came on whenever Dewey & Gale were in the same scene.And finally...... Why does everyone hero worship Kevin Williamson and why is his name above anyone elses on the movie posters?.

Is Scream 2 one of them? Definitely not. The first Scream film worked well because it played with the rules of the slasherflick (although it is far less original in this than you might think, as Wes Craven's own New Nightmare did pretty much the same thing) without subverting them and because it brought a much needed energy back into the genre. I don't think Scream is a true horror classic (I didn't think it was very scary), but it's still great fun. Scream 2 aimes for pretty much the same thing. It's another postmodern slasher where the characters know the rules of the genre and where the filmmakers play around with them.Sometimes, it still works. The whole sequel-discussion will please anyone with a casual interest in film, the cameos by Heather Graham and Tori Spelling (as Neve Campbell's character in the movie-within-the-movie based on the events in Scream) are cleverly inserted into the film and there's even a hint the filmmakers are trying to confound the audience' expectations (one slashing is an example in particular). It's not as though Kevin Williamson's film-literate script is a complete waste of time. But apart from these clever flourishes, there's very little here. Sure, he throws in 'subtexts' like the media's obsession with violence and, more notably and bravely, the whole relationship between violence in media (and film in particular) and in real-life. But as it doesn't do a lot with its subtexts, so what you're left with is your usual barrage of killings and a whodunnit storyline. And a lot of it isn't nearly as sharp as Scream. The dialogue has its moments, but the character interplay is as shallow as possible and there's an awful scene where Neve Campbell has to dodge a real knife among fake ones in a stage play. It's the type of hugely theatrical scene that doesn't work at all in this type of film. Apart from that, the conclusion to the whole whodunnit isn't nearly as satisfying as Scream's.What makes it worse is the rushed execution. Wes Craven is a gifted horror director and not a gifted stylist and Scream 2 brings out the worst in him. The entire film is shot in a dull, predictable fashion and at times it almost looks (cinematographically, anyway) random. Worse even is the handling of the typical horror film staples. The shocks are telegraphed early but don't work because of clumsy editing (the first 'shock' is a case in point). The gore level is very low (actually, apart from the sound effects there is nearly no real gore) and it doesn't have any atmosphere. Craven is talented, but here he's clearly rushed his work in order to release before the genre dies again.And that's the whole film's problem, it feels too rushed. Which is also noticeable in the music, where they use part of the Broken Arrow soundtrack as Dewey's theme (or is this a VERY misguided popculture reference?). I really think with (a lot) more polishing Scream 2 could have a competent, enjoyable romp, but as is, it's only occasionally entertaining.Rating: 5/10",Scream 2
246,WandrinStar,Scream 2 (1997),7,24 April 2012,"70/100. Apparently Scream didn't get the message from earlier slasher movies that the sequel is supposed to be bad to average. What I really like about Scream 2 is that it doesn't try and be all that different and they for all intensive purposes cop to that fact in the movie by referencing it consistently even playing reenacted scenes from the previous years film. As if that point wasn't already shoved down our throats we are constantly reminded by multiple characters that sequels always are inferior. Why such the high grade? Because not only is the story just as scary and funny, but its characterization may even be superior. By the end of the film Courtney Cox as Gale Weathers is not the same person she was at all in first Scream, and you really feel for Sidney understanding her inner demons and reluctance of trust toward her college boyfriend after her fling with her psychopathic high school sweetheart. It was fun to see more than one character from a previous slasher film especially since I enjoyed all of the characters previously. One of the few teen slice and dice movies where you actually really pull for your favorite characters to come out alive. Liev Screiber is fantastic in an expanded role as the hard luck former lover of Mrs. Prescott looking to cash in on his misfortune of being wrongly accused for her death as detailed in the first Scream. Kevin Williamson writes his crass dialogue beautifully which really made me wonder why more characters haven't been fleshed out similarly before. I was a big fan of the opening which I felt was even better than the slightly over-the-top intro with Drew Barrymore. Although the final showdown was somewhat of a let down, scenes such as having to crawl past the killer to escape the pinned police car and Sarah Michelle Gellar's frightening encounter with Ghost face certainly gave off enough thrills. Admittedly not as good as the first, Scream 2 in my mind very well might be the best slasher sequel made to date.",Scream 2
247,joaniekilbride,"'Scream 2' ends up a fun, bloody and silly slasher...",7,10 December 2004,"Scream 2 It has been two years since the tragic events at Woodsboro. Sidney Prescott and Randy Meeks are trying to get on with their lives, and are currently both students at Windsor College. Cotton Weary is out of prison, and is trying to cash in on his unfortunate incarceration. Gale Weathers has written a bestseller, ""The Woodsboro Murders,"" which has been turned into the film, ""Stab,"" starring Tori Spelling as Sidney. As the film's play date approaches, the cycle of death begins anew. Dewey Riley immediately flies out of Woodsboro to try to protect Sidney, his ""surrogate sister."" But in this sequel to the 1996 horror film, the number of suspects only goes down as the body count slowly goes up! 'Scream 2' is a fun slasher. It is faster than the original but also much more diabolical, which isn't good in this situation. Neve Campbell once again gives a good performance as Sidney, and other good performances include Sarah Michelle Gellar, Courtney Cox and David Arquette.As stated in my one line summary, 'Scream 2' is a fun, bloody slasher that goes over-the-top sometimes but it still has a nice momentum and execution. The death scenes are good,particularly CiCi Cooper's scene. I enjoy Kevin Williamson's style of writing, particularly in this film.So, In the end, 'Scream 2' ends up being everything it wants to be... a fun, bloody, silly slasher...3/4 R- strong, bloody horror violence and language",Scream 2

Horror movies basically died at the end of the eighties and begin of the nineties. Low budget horror movies like Dead Alive and Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer were very unknown, don't think many teenagers of today can find any interest in these movies like I can, but there have been classic horror movies in the 90's like Silence of The Lambs and Candyman were pretty good. Scream was good re-hash of some of those Friday The 13th rip-offs. It made around hundred and six million , not true blockbuster , but very profitable gain from its budget. Entertaining and Enthusiastic, but not as good as some of earlier horror movies like Silence of the Lambs, Candyman, Dead Alive, and Henry: Portrait of Serial Killer. Scream 2 was rehash of its orignal, the storyline is mediocre, but everything else just plain trash. This movie is tries to take every aspect of the first film and tries hard to re generate it. Result, not as good as it should have been. This movie had a lot potential, but just didn't deliver like the first one did. The killers weren't relevant or developed towards the plot. I actually knew killers from start to finish without any spoilers. I'm dead serious!There is a sequel that is about to begin production. I think  Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson should stop this movie trend while their ahead. If horror movies are going to based around whodunit plots.

251,EllisDee,The killer killed the movie,6,5 October 1998,"""Scream 2"" could have been a good horror film with its fairly good cast, but unfortunately, it violates an important law of horror movies:  the killer(s) and the slayings have to be distinctive, interesting, and inspire terror from the audience!  If killing is the business of the killer(s) in ""Scream 2,"" then somebody had better file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Except for toying with Sarah Michelle Gellar over the phone a little, the killer(s) in this movie just stabs and runs.  How terrifying...Ironically, when ""Scream 2"" has an in-class discussion about sequels being inferior films, it ends up referring to itself.  The Friday the 13th series often get maligned as mindless slasher films, but at least Jason killed some of his victims in unusual ways, such as swinging one of them against a tree like an axe or smashing & electrocuting another one by smashing a TV set on his head.

Frankly I felt the gore wasn't very extreme, nothing compared to Steve's intestines, and Casey's body in the first. The main characters are strong ( Sidney and Gale ) though I have less emotion for Sidney. Gale has taken on new heights and is still fully enjoyable. Though many were angered at one character's untimely death, fans and those who weren't previously, can still find themselves having an extreme good time.

255,VenomX,"Feels rushed, lacks real innovation *SPOILERS*",6,6 December 2002,"*SPOILER WARNING*The main rule I have when it comes to sequels is this: do not release them too early or it'll feel rushed and do not release them too late or my interest in the franchise will decline.  Scream 2 breaks the former rule, released a year after the original, it's goal is to spoof horror movies by having a killer imitate them in his killings.  In the sequel, it's goal is to have the killer imitate horror movie sequels.  Sound confusing? It is.One thing that most horror movie sequels have in common is that they all drag us through the same path that the original did, and end up being really weak.  Add that to the already rushed nature of this film and we have ourselves a film that pales in comparison to the original.  The part that these films always contained that entertained me is the entire ""who is the killer?"" feeling, I actually found it much more present in this one than the original, but in the end, it all falls apart.The killers in the end are revealed to be two very underdeveloped characters, which destroyed the ending for me.As soon as the killer took off his mask, my initial thought was ""Who is that?"", then ""OK, I think I know who they are, what was their motives?"".  Turns out that character's motive was that his accomplice would pay his tuition if he dressed up as a Ghostface and killed people, (on a lighter note, wouldn't if have been a little easier just to rob a convenience store? Less blood involved).  His accomplice turned out to be an annoying reporter-type character that was using that disguise to ""get closer"" to the university and get revenge against Sydney (very underdeveloped motive here).On a positive note, this film does build up the suspense quite well and the whole ""Whodunit?"" theme is very much present (I started pointing fingers to several characters throughout the film).  We do get more gore than present in the original and a general sense that the writers were serious about the whole ""sequel"" thing in the beginning of the film.  A little disappointing, definitely suffers from all the flaws that sequels do have.  Not as groundbreaking as the first one was, still a decent watch though.5.5/10",Scream 2
256,joedamato-1,Sensitive Neve,10,20 December 2004,"With Scream Wes Craven proved once again he's one of the world leading horror directors, but Scream 2 is much better to me than the original.

I'm not going to encounter the good directress, nice script etc. I knew it will on the highest level long before watching (Like in Craven's all movies). I can't have any gripe at all. Perfect sequel! Much comes to Campbell, but thanks to this film I know such a brilliant actor like Timothy Olyphant and all the others closer to leading ones were either already my favourites or they became after Scream 2. Neve Campbell here god, it's not even the half of enough to say she's good. She's something much-much and much better than just a pretty face and nice actress. She makes you crazy. As you watch you want to help her all the time. She's able so save the most condemned to failure project, but here as we also had Kevin Williamson involved, this project was condemned to become classic and make famous everyone connected with it. Wes Craven is obviously the only director that would never disappoint. I know that since first watched ""The snake and serpent"". He manages doing sensitive movies.

And that flicks like this spawn their copycats , just the way they were spawned themselves- right out of the monotonous , teenager - slashing stupidity of "" Friday the 13th "" , "" Texas chainsaw massacre "" and the like . Pardon me for blaspheming , I know these are true classics to many , but , let's face it , folks - what's frightening about a movie where there are no surprises to speak of , no originality , no real suspense , just one stereotype after another ? WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE , MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO . It was fresher then .Now , it's like a fish slowly rotting away on a fish market one week after it's been pulled out of the water . Wow , how yummy .Wes Craven is a true genius - he found out a way to make big bucks by selling something that's been sold more times than Viagra .The story is ridiculous , the conclusion barely makes sense , and that first scene in the theater- boy , what a farce ! A girl , fatally stabbed with a knife through a dashboard ( these serial killers must be doing a lot of workout ) crawls out of the lavatory bleeding like a pig , stumbles through the crowded theater just to scream her last scream right in front of the movie screen and then drop dead - instead of searching for help ?It's a straightforward comedy , no need for a parody - because that's what the whole movie already is . Someone's killing teenagers ? Really ? Oh ,no ! He stalks them , calls them on the phone using a voice modulator , mask and a big knife ? How original , how new , never seen before ! All the teenagers are pretty and sexy ? Well , another surprise , in other slashers they usually look like Quasimodos .As far as I'm concerned , this is not horror , this is pure commercial exploitation of the horror genre in the most shallow , dumb , farcical and materialistic manner .

273,TheBeardedWonder,Mediocre with little to say and minimal gore,5,11 October 2021,"Not sure what the reviews here or critically are talking about when it comes to the gore - there's very little here. Even main stars from the first are killed off-screen multiple times, presumably so they could keep the options open to have them come back in a sequel - which literally does happen. One lived through everything just to be dragged into a mini van and stabbed out of the cameras view. Talk about lazy!Entire sub plots are brought up and dropped, characters seem to do things for no reason, the gore has been edited out so much it's almost a TV edit, and the flick thinks it's smarter than it actually is. It actually has very little to say about sequels or diminishing returns, at least the fourth had some clever things to say about reboots and remakes. The first has a TON to say about slashers and violence and tropes and gender roles within them, etc. This has basically nothing to comment on about sequels other than 'they're bad.' Yes, that's about the start and stop of their views.The Greek tragedy idea is brought up and goes nowhere (this flick doesn't even fit the definition of one btw so what happened here?) Oh, it was apparently rewritten multiple times when the original script leaked. No wonder people disappear and reappear at random and people do/say things that make no sense.That explains just about everything and why it's such a quickly thrown together flick. Seriously it came out less than a year after the first one. Imagine writing, editing, setting everything up and hiring people, filming it, and chopping it together in under a year.No wonder this has nothing to say and is light on the gore. Why did the killers even kill the people in the opening scene? They have nothing to do with anything. Every death in scream 1 made sense to the plot, literally within the first scene of scream 2 that's dropped and nothing makes any sense.Which is totally OK if you're going for a brainless splatterfest.

When I saw this film I applauded once again for Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson. The sequel was good, but of course will never be as good as the original. We once again see a serial killer targeting Sidney Prescott, played again by Neve Campbell, who is now in college and is involved in ""another game"" of horror movie mayhem. The movie has more deaths, gore, and laughs for the ride which makes it great entertainment. This is a worthy sequel.",Scream 2

What the hell are you people on?  This is by far THE best horror sequel of all time.  Much more solid than ever before, the horror genre reached it's peak with this film's release.  Someone here wrote that the killers were not significant to the story....  Hum, did you even WATCH the movie, or did you just scan through it?  The killers here were even more relevant than in the first one. Granted, it couldn't have happened without the first one, but darn...  Also someone wrote that there is one death every five minutes.  Were you drunk when you watched the movie?  After the first ten minutes, there's not a death scene in over an hour.  I loved the first one, and to try to top it was a little too much to ask for.  But this movie gave one heck of a fight to try to do it, and I personally think it did in fact top it.  The person who wrote that Wes Craven never has likable characters...  You need to get those arrows out of your ass.  Johnny Depp and Heather Langenkamp from ""Nightmare on Elm Street""?  Julie in ""Wes Craven's New Nightmare""?  Angela Bassett in ""Vampire in Brooklyn""?  And ALL the characters in ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2""?  Even the bitchy ones were rendered entertaining.  I was left literally with my mouth wide open while reading your comments.  You trash brilliant movies like this, and praise such idiotic, trashy and terrible films like ""The Waterboy"", ""Big Daddy"" and other complete and utter s***. I can't wait for ""Scr3am"", because they say it's more mature than the two others, which is just what this series needs; one more excellent entry to make this the best horror series in history.

But they only get worse fellas. All these movies are predictable; you know who is gonna get it & when. They try to make these movies have twists by making the killer have some sort of relationship to the lead, played by Neve Campbell. At first I blamed Wes Craven for these movies, but then I realized that it was screenwriter Kevin Williamson. Hmmm, why are these movies so dumb...? Could it be because that he used to write ""Dawson's Creek"" ? Why is he even bothering trying to ruin the horror genre? Because of him, every independent film company is making these stupid teen-horror flicks. Where is Jason when you need him to rid us of all of these dumb characters?",Scream 2

It is definitely not a horror flick, but then neither was its prequel, so if you get this in order to be scared out of your mind, then you will be disappointed. However, if what you expect is an entertaining film with a few shocks and its fair share of laughs, then you will enjoy Scream 2. The body count is high (with several old favourites going under the knife), the acting is good, the humour is there, and the end is as surprisingly superb as ever.

280,svswinger-2,Upon further review.......,9,6 January 2000,"The first time I saw this movie, opening night, I couldn't have been more disappointed. After the opening scene, which was great, I thought Scream 2 spiraled downward and every scene was worst then the one before it, finally wrapping up with the worst ending ever seen on film. I hated this movie. That is, until I was able to see it again on video. Sometimes it takes a second viewing on video to really concentrate and pay attention to all the little details to really appreciate a movie. This is one of those movies.   While I still believe the ending was terrible, I thought the rest of the movie gets better every time I watch it. The opening scene is fantastic, and (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) I loved the idea of the killer sitting in the movie theater amongst hundreds of look-alike killers, with nobody knowing who the killer is or if he's even there. As Jada Pinkett finds out in a very clever scene, he is there.   I thought the best scene in the movie occurs when Randy, Dewey, and Gail are standing in the grass courtyard at the college, and the killer calls them on Gail's cell phone, playing games and watching them from a distance. I love the camerawork used while following Randy around as he searches for the killer. One shot in particular has the camera looking down on him from the sky, nobody else visible in the whole shot, which gives a feeling of me against the world, which Randy must have been feeling. The whole scene is great.   Is Scream 2 better than the original? No, but you can't compare a sequel to its original, because it will never compare (as they discuss within the movie.) ""Sequels by definition alone are inferior films"" Scream was one of the few horror movies I could truly call great, and Scream 2 is likewise one of those rare sequels that at least approach the quality of the original (such as with Lethal Weapon 3 & 4 and Die Hard With a Vengeance).
   Now for the ending. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) They hinted throughout the movie as to the killers identity ""Mrs. Voohries was a terrific killer"" But I never thought they would cop out and go for the simple answer of ""Billy's mother?"" She was terrible as the killer, and did nothing but annoy me the entire movie. Mickey at least was interesting, but his character was barely even developed and then, all of the sudden, here he is, your serial killer. I thought for sure going in that Stu somehow survived the first Scream and was coming back for part two, and when they introduced Debbie Salt as the killer, my heart took a dive. The ending was pathetic, and I still hold out hope of a decent killer in part 3 (maybe Stu), but I still give it a 9 out of 10, with the ending keeping it from a 10.",Scream 2

283,jacobhenrytucker-1,Fabulous!,10,4 March 2007,"When I saw the previews of Scream 2, I cringed. I thought it would be one of those sequels where it all goes wrong after the original. How wrong I was, this film was just as good as the original.Once again, Scream 2 manages to maintain it's uniqueness with a different storyline altogether. The cast are exceptional with David Arquette, Neve Campell and Courtney Cox. The beginning looked a bit dodgy but it finally got to the storyline.Another thing you will notice which is different from the original Scream is that it's more humorous. It's got it's jokes now and then which in my opinion is not too bad as long as it remains suspenseful which it did.Sarah Michelle Gellar also has a small role in the movie and does a very good job of it.The only negative thing I have to say about is that near the end, the script seems rushed and the dialogue is too long but that's all.Would I recommend it? Yes 10/10",Scream 2
284,Gen S2rt,"A good sequel, but not to outshine the original (what sequel does?)",9,17 January 1999,"""Scream 2"" is pretty good when compared to the original, which many sequels aren't, but like the man says, sequels are by definition inferior films, so at least this one wasn't THAT inferior. In this film, a series of copycat murders are happening around Sydney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and the new killer starts coming after her and the other Woodsboro survivors. One thing I missed while watching this was the occasional laugh from the first one. This one had a couple of good lines, but ""Scream"" was definitely funnier, making fun of its own kind of movie. The funniest part in either film still remains as the moment in ""Scream"" when the killer is coming up behind Randy (JAMIE Kennedy) as he watches ""Halloween"" and says ""Jamie, look behind you!"" (referring to Jamie Lee Curtis). The acting in this film is not quite as good as it was in the original, but wasn't bad. Dewey (David Arquette) had a couple of moments of overdoing it, but not too many. The main problem with the film was the 'who's the killer' mystery.  There are more suspects to deal with, and the filmmakers seemed worried that if the killer's character is developed too much before revealing that they are the killer, then people will figure it out prematurely. As a result, when the killer is revealed, perhaps you didn't see it coming, but you aren't really shocked that this person could be a killer because you don't really know much of anything about them. One thing you start to learn during the movie is that just because someone was involved in the first ordeal, it doesn't mean that they aren't a possible suspect now, nor does it necessarily mean they aren't a potential victim.  Depending on how suspicious you are of people, there are countless numbers of suspects in the film, and to a really on-guard person, just about anyone in the movie is a suspect, which makes it really hard to identify the killer.  There was one thing I didn't like about the movie, and one character was murdered who I still think should have survived. I really can't see from here how they are planning to make ""Scream 3"" after this film seemed to burn the bridge to another sequel. It isn't necessary, seeing as how the same characters (mainly Sidney) have gone through the same type of ordeal twice, which is just on the edge of plausibility.  Maybe it's just so they can call it a ""trilogy"", but it really wouldn't be, because there really is a difference between a trilogy and a film with two sequels. In general, one sequel is enough and maybe pushing it, and a second sequel is almost always too far.  ""Scream 2"" is still scary, and may even be as scary as the first, although the opening scene of ""Scream"" is still the scariest of it all. This sequel doesn't make the same mistake many sequels to good films make, which is abandoning suspense altogether when it is too busy going all out with what it may have held back on in the first film, which in this case would have been as much gruesome death as possible. While it does have this extra gore (obviously it's going to -- this is a horror movie, after all) it still manages to have the same suspense that made the first one terrifying. If you loved the first film, you'll probably like this one too. This is still a good movie, but the first one, as always, was the best.",Scream 2

288,timesplitterz,not a worthy sequel but not a bad film,7,18 April 2011,"Scream 2 is an odd film to say the least, it in no way lives up to the first film but is not a completely terrible film. After watching this film recently (having not seen it in several years) I was left feeling confused about the movie. Having Sid at college is a great settling for a slasher film, it has creepy corridors, college parties, loads of suspects and much more elements that could be used, but the film doesn't seem to utilises them well enough.The film didn't have the same sort of scares that the first film included, the scare scenes in this film just don't feel as they did in the first. The movie also fails on doing what made the first film so brilliant which was the nod to previous slashers and horror movies, it became less of a parody and more of the many films the original Scream was poking fun at. However saying all this the film still has its up sides, there are some great scenes within the film and some of them are quite remember able. I personally felt that in some of the cool scenes there is much room for improvement and that they could of done so much with them. It does have its moments and there is one scene that is sort of moving in its own way but not much more then that. Scream 2 is good if your looking to put something on with a couple of mates thats fun and has its jumpy moments as well but thats all it is while the first one was fun to watch with friends but was really cleaver. In conclusion Scream 2 isn't the best of Scream films but it includes some great moments and as always unpredictable Killer/Killers.",Scream 2
289,Sweetie-10,Better than the first part!,1,1 May 1999,"Well, ""Scream 2"" is much better than the first part. Maybe it is because I watched the first part on video and the second in cinema, but I am just 14 and I almost started to cry at the beginning of the film when the killer is running after the woman in the movie theater. It's sooo scary, too when Sydney and her friend are in the car with the killer and try to go out of it. This movie is really great and full of suspense!!!",Scream 2
290,pinback-6,And why should this scare me?,5,25 May 2000,"Granted, when I rented the film I had very low expectations. I found out that I didn't think the film sucked, but I had many problems with it. First of all, the killer/killers is/are so easy to spot that it's almost embarrassing. Again, the musical score is utter and total crap. And also it's not nearly as funny as the original. I thought the funniest scene was in the ""movie in the movie"" when Tori Spelling is going to take a shower and we get a shot of the shower knob with water streaming down EXACTLY like the one in ""Psycho""! That, and that they for some reason play the theme from John Woo's ""Broken Arrow"" every time David Arquette enters. Other than that, it relies on stringers instead of atmosphere and suspense, which is truly despicable. It's well shot and edited, and pretty well acted, but that's about it. Above all, the film is too predictable and too stupid to be scary, and that's not a good thing for a horror film. It's not bad, it's and allright film, just not something particularly memorable.

291,j-kirby247,Can it Be...? A Sequel That Doesn't Suck?,9,26 March 2012,"That is exactly what it is. A sequel that doesn't suck. This continuation is actually as good as the origin of the quadrilogy (god I really hate that word, why not just call it a trilogy plus one). Anywho, you know what is next (sorry for sounding so self-important).Basic Story Guide: Two years after the Woodsboro murders, everyone from the original movie (who survived) have gotten on with their lives. While two collage seniors are attending a movie preview of ""Stab,"" the movie adaptation of the ""Woodsboro Murders,"" not just the event itself but a book written by Gale Weathers, both are killed by someone wearing the infamous ""Ghostface"" mask. Sidney Prescott is attending Windsor Collage along side Randy Meeks when she receives the news of the two murders and is adamant that this is just the beginning, while Randy is skeptical. After the third victim is found murdered, Gale sees a pattern: some of the names match up to victims of the first killing spree, and there is only conclusion, a copycat on campus and wanting to make a real sequel. Sidney is once again pitted against Ghostface, but by the end, not everyone who made it out of Woodsboro may not make it out of Windsor Collage alive.Verdict: While this movie is not as good as the Scream, it is (as the title implies) a sequel that does not suck. A rarity in the horror genre. Those who were attracted to Screams style of bloody violence, the meta humor, and the mystery of who-done-it, will love Scream 2 as much as the first.",Scream 2
292,will51224,"Finally, a worthy sequel!",9,23 July 2001,"!!!SPOILERS!!!Although Scream 2 has its flaws and may not be as entertaining as the original, I found it to be just as scary, funny, enjoyable, clever, and even as original as the first Scream.  The opening theater scene was just plain genius!  Great dialogue, GREAT casting (Jada and Omar make one terrific team!), and of course, horror!  It was very intense - I was VERY into it - and it was so clever how it was the complete opposite of Scream's opening scene (Casey was alone in a house, while Maureen and Phil were in a crowded theater/bathroom).  Although Casey's opening scene was scarier because you're more likely to get killed at home then in a crowded theatre, (and it was weird and far-fetched how no one noticed that poor Maureen was being stabbed to death) it was still just as clever and intense.Once again, Kevin Williamson delivers a script with witty dialogue and well-developed characters.  It may not have as great a plot as Scream and Scream 3, but considering it's a sequel to a masterpiece, I'd say it's good enough.  And, of course, Wes Craven is able to produce extremely intense, suspenseful death scenes, complimented nicely by another one of Marco Beltrami's magnificent scores.  My favorite scene was the car crash. Completely terrifying!  It's great how just when Sid (Neve Campbell) and Hal (Elise Neal - pretty good actress) get out of the car and you can breathe a sigh of relief, Sidney decides to unmask the killer, and, unfortunately for Hallie, it backfires and the killer pops out again!I have to admit that guessing who the killer was wasn't quite as fun as in the first, but the identity of one of them (Billy's mother - played well by Laurie Metcalf) was a great twist and made up for it.  Also, Mickey (Timothy something) was just as funny as Stu in the original.I was heart-broken when Randy (Jamie Kennedy) and CiCi (Sarah Michelle Gellar) died (I'm a big fan of Buffy) but their performances were superb nonetheless.  Jerry O'Connell was even pretty good as Derek, Sid's new sane boyfriend (my sister always goes ga-ga over his cafeteria singing scene) and Liev Schrieber was great in his biggest role of the Scream movies; he made a good possible suspect.  Neve, David, and Courtney do great jobs as well reprising their roles.It would be unfair to say that this is just as good as the original (after all, Scream is a masterpiece), but Randy was wrong: all sequels DON'T suck!

This is of no exception to the rule despite humor to the contrary at first where the film-students boast & brag about sequels being better such as the case of Empire Strikes Back etc. In fact, after having seen bits of 3 too, I'd have to say this was the worst installment yet! They even go out of their way to make fun of themselves in the middle of the movie. And that ought to give you a clue that this is a genuine joke of a 'horror movie' in itself. The humor though is kinda stale after a while. On the other hand, however, it is nice to see that someone doesn't take himself that seriously like most others, despite the fact that they do tend to make their audience laugh rather than scream as intended.Anyways, no tits/almost no blood -- yep, a 2 in my book.

Scream1 and 2 each have certain elements and scenes that are rest assured not coincidentally almost exactly alike. For instance, Dewey, Gale, and Sydney are your typical Scream heroes, (or at least it looks as though they are). A question asked during both movies is `Did the boyfriend do it?' You've got to be a certified genius to figure out who the killer is in this murder mystery, because in short, everyone's a suspect!The sensational teenage cast plays a big role in bringing Scream2 to its full potential. Jada Pinkett, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jerry O' Connell, Liev Schreiber, David Arquette, Courtney Cox, Tori Spelling, and of course, Neve Campbell are what make up this phenomenal cast of Gen. X's. The scenes are gripping as each one takes you on a trip through terror lane, using each important character as your tour guide for the intense adventure.Though the movie is exceedingly interesting, it is obviously not the most realistic movie. Everything revolves around killings, and key word, possible killings. Even so, Scream2 isn't so far from reality (okay, it is, but Craven did his best anyway); the outrageous parts were done to look as believable as possible.As many more people were killed in the sequel than were in the previous movie, (remember, all second flicks have twice the mayhem), which has proved that the more murdered, the merrier. Characters were literally torn apart, and the audiences liked it, despite how gruesome it may sound, it definitely caught their attention, and it certainly caught mine!Scream2, directed by Wes Craven, also starring Elise Neal, has earned it's A in the ever lasting genre of horror movies.",Scream 2
297,time_2_scream,FANTASTIC!!!,8,16 August 2001,"this movie is great but not quite as good as the other two scream movies in the trilogy but u should still see it because it is really very very good. MAJOR SPOILERS!! for the rest of this comments now i'm mainly writing this to explain some things that the ppl who didn't like this film said was bad or unrealistic. so here goes.1. the killer mickey does seem realistic if u watch the movie again cause u will notice that he does carry a camera around ( most noticeable in the scene where u r once again introduced to gale weathers when she is listening to the police officers statement) and throughout the movie he is always pointing the finger at someone. but miss loomis i have to admit didn't have much of a clue but she too points the fingers at someone else such as the scene where she tells the other reporters that she thought it was supicious that sid's father was gone abroad again and u will notice that she and sidney never meet throughout the movie until the end. but i thought that having her as the killer was a very good twist and very surprising so i'm not complaining.2.in the car scene the camera focuses in on the gun because the killer then takes it for the finale and that explains why they had a long shot looking at it. and of course sidney and her roommate hallie wouldn't have noticed it, i mean they just escaped and they were probably bloody scared that the killer was going to grab their legs as they escaped.3. the horn sounded because her other hand was leaning on the horn when she was about to unmask the killer.4. they couldn't smash the windows because it's a cop car and the back windows r a lot more reinforced that the others and they also didn't want to make too much sound in case it woke the killer.5. in a who dunnit flick the killer always reveals himself to her main target, if he didn't then u would be pretty annoyed if u never knew who the killer was at the end of the movie and besides they thought that they were gonna kill sidney anyway so they weren't afraid to show her they're real identity.6. back to the car scene, sidney does try to take off the mask of the killer, the 1st time she gets scared cause of the horn noise and the killer might have woken up and remember she is still leaning over him, and the 2nd time she goes back but he killer isn't there. there i'm done answering the questions of the STUPID ppl who just didn't understand  the film (no offence intended). now just a quicky on how much i luv this film. the cast were once again brilliant and the i think that there were more suspense scenes in the sequel such as the car scene and the soundproof rooms. i also loved the camera shots throughout the movie most notebally (i have no idea how to spell that sorry) the final camera shot which goes over the whole university at the end. overall very very good definately not a bad sequel but not as good as the first one because that was the origianal one and that's hard to top but scream 3 is the best of all of them. so watch this movie it definately deserves a higher mark that imdb users gave it just because they didn't understand it so GO WATCH NOW.",Scream 2

Sidney's boyfriend was annoying as well as Cotton who could seem to never shut up. The ending was strange considering it took place in a theatre room with a bunch of flashing lights glaring all over the place.

The first killing in the original was very well executed, and convincing, but in this, the first killing is poorly executed and unconvincing, although the idea behind it is quite good.This film is probably worth watching, but does not have the spark of originality that the original had.  It is scary in places, and has funny moments but this is by no means as good as the original was.",Scream 2
300,djgold_1999,It was indeed better then part 1,10,15 September 2008,"Yes, it's true that original movies, like part 1 of any movie or series is claimed to be the ""best"", just because it kicked off everything.Well if that's so true? Then howcome Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me, was 10 times better then the first part and made more money? I can't speak about this movie, on the the money part. Is it better then part 1, much much better. Non-stop action and killing. Story was good and had twists. The first 1, was more like an 80's slasher flick. It really didn't have much of a moral, it did have you wanting to ask more questions.This movie did have a huge cast of names, that a big now. Omar Epps, Jada Pinkett Smith, just to name a few. But sorry to dissappoint, but Elise Neal stole some of the movie, from Neve Campbell. She was much prettier and had personality, not ""dim-wittedness"".If someone would like non-stop action horror with a good story and the least amount of ""yawns"" and slow-downs in a movie, watch this. It's much better then the original. Piece of advice, never ever ever watch Scream 3, absolute garbage, boring and has no story, even if it was paid to have one. Thank You for reading, just accessing my hypothesis.",Scream 2
301,IIscr3amII,Wonderful!!,10,7 August 2002,Scream 2 was even better than the hit Scream. It was twice as scary and entertaining. It also had surprising new killers that nobody would have guessed. Scream 2 is what every horror movie should be like .. Three words to describe it would be thrilling and wonderfully scary!,Scream 2
302,Mhjm6,I just have to say....,2,13 October 2005,"that this is one of the dumbest horror movies I have ever seen. When it's not trying to be ""scary,"" {not by a longshot} it just wastes the rest of it's time with bad acting explaining how revenge is being plotted. That's all it's about. The first movie was mediocre all by itself. It was only inevitable, like many sequels, that it HAS to worse than before. It's not even very surprising when you find out who the killer is, and that's the only good scene in my humble opinion. I somewhat enjoy the soundtrack from time to time except for the rap songs, but that's probably the only 2 likable things about ""Scream 2."" I was disappointed when I actually WANTED to see this movie.Overall: 2 stars {at the most!}",Scream 2

How in the world could this movie have gone wrong? Good cast but a horrible script I guess. Neve Campbell, Jada Pinket, and Sarah Michelle Gellar couldn't even save this sorry excuse for a horror flick. I give this one a D. There were only two good ""jump scenes"" and the ending was totally stupid. I don't think I'll be going to see ""Scream 3"".",Scream 2
304,nedjo,9 out of 10,10,4 September 1999,The 1st one is one of my all time favorite movies. I give the the 1st a 10 and the 2nd a 9. It's not as bad as some people say it is. Since the 1st one was so good people had such high expectations that scream 2 couldn't match them. So rent the movie again and just don't hold a grudge about it and just watch it. Neve Campbell (my love) is great as Sidney.,Scream 2
305,Pinupguy,Not as scary but twice as funny,8,1 October 1999,"Scream 2 was flawed from the beginning. The release of this film so close to it's original was warning enough that this film would not be as good. The movie process can be a quick one but the process of making a GOOD movie is a little longer. With that said though Scream 2 is still pretty darn good.With the release of Stab, a film depicting the events of Woodsboro, copycat murders soon begin and so does a media invasion on the university that valiant Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is attending. The usual run from the killer scenes are there as is the who dunnit mystery of the original but has varying degrees of success with both. Scream 2 isn't as scary as it's predecesor instead replacing the horror with bitchy banter between Sidney and Gale Weathers (Cox in her returning role) and never ending pop culture references which do get tiresome with no suspence until at least 3/4 of the way through the movie (besides the opening scene).The cast isn't up to the caliber of the original either with the returning characters simply going through the motions. Neve seems bored, Kennedy's oddly reserved as Randy and David Arquette is back sporting a limp which he concentrates on more than his acting. Cox on the other hand is sensational. She's twice as bitchy and even colder second time round. As for the new recruits. They are as bland as the returning ones with a few exceptions. Pinkett betters Drew Barrymore's infamous opening scene, with her pro black attitude at the premiere of the white dominated film, Stab. Olyphant is also good as the ""freaky Tarantino film student"" as is Laurie Metcalf as a rival reporter. This film has high expectations to live up to and while it's a great film in it's own right, as a Scream sequel, it doesn't even rank. Grade - B+",Scream 2
306,urban_legend,Up to par with the original,10,19 March 2001,"This is one of those sequels that is just as good as the first.  Nothing was lost in the transition.  Supposedly there was a different first draft of the script that had a different killer, but I don't see how it could've compared to this.  Don't get me wrong, the first one is by far better, but this one is also good.  The only problem I had with part 2 is the whole part about the copycat killer.  I would've made for a better plot if that angle were carried throughout the film.  And once again, the opening fifteen minutes are extremely gratifying.  Too bad Mr. Williamson didn't stay around for the third installment.",Scream 2
307,mrghstfacenc17,WHAT A GREAT SEQUEL!!!,10,28 March 2000,"when i first heard that they were going to make a sequel to the amazing SCREAM, i was truly mad. i didnt think it would be any good because all sequels suck. but since i loved SCREAM so much i wanted to go see it. i went in the theater and walked out completly amazed!(again) this movie was excellent and it was made and released a year after the original! i couldn't believe that they could make a sequel like this. wes craven and kevin williamson didnt let us down. they made a terrific sequel. bcuz of this movie i have good faith in other sequels...

308,oliverz-91768,Okay - 3/5,6,18 October 2020,"I really liked Scream 1. And I do like Scream 2.There's a lot to like here. Neve Campbell actually does better in this one than Part 1. Her acting is slightly better and the character feels a lot more mature. Gale Weathers gets a TON of development and it's really nice to see her go from one of my least favorite characters to somehow you can really cheer for at the end. They went that route with the first Scream but didn't really quite get there. It's quite impressive when you consider that Scream 2 had more a ways to go.However, the biggest problem is that the film shelves a lot of terror for character development and plot. The plot is a bit more well-rounded than the first. The characters are deeper and generally more likable. But it definitely shelves it's scares for characters. The first film managed to balance scares and substance. The ratio was more scares to substance, but this one is mostly substance over scares. Unfortunately, this film somewhat fails to balance the elements. It feels less like a horror film and more like a pretty good college flick.Not bad though. I had a blast watching it, even if I was bored during the second act.Also that twist came from left field. I don't want to talk about it but geez it was stupid",Scream 2
309,Vandendam,Not much to say,6,16 June 2019,"The Scream movies will be in our minds forever!It's not that they were wonderful, but they were at that time and still even to this day one of the best slasher movies ever made.If someone ask you for a good movie, you can always say.... Go watch a SCREAM movie!",Scream 2
310,killer_tray,a plot outlook *Spoiler*,8,20 July 2006,"alright, this movie didn't surpass the first, but it sure put some sequel writers in there place. The movie is constantly saying that when your pushing the tenth movie in a horror series(Jason for example), maybe you should think where you going.Sidney, now in college, has a new best friend, Boyfriend, and and life all round. Though she is still friends with all the survivors, Randy, Dewey and Gale(well sort of). Then her life is turned, once again, upside-down by the new movie release of ""Stab"", a movie based on the the novel ""The Woodboros Murders"" By Gale weathers. During the opening night of the film, a couple is brutally murdered. Sidney sees the news of the two murders, paranoia starts to take over. Randy, at the same college, tells her not to worry in between arguments with Mickey, a friend, that sequels ruin originals. Gale, to Sidneys shock brings out Cotton Weary(the man originally accused of Sidney's mother's murder), Cotton, unlike Sidney, wants the spotlight and his 15 minutes of fame that he thinks he deserves. Sidney refuses to talk to Cotton on camera and hits Gale(again). Gale is then asks a lot of questions by Debbie Salt, a press reporter.Soon after, Cici, a sorority girl, is murdered and Sidney comes close to being killed. Derek is attacked, but survives. Derek is asked by Sidney to keep his distance until they find the killer. Gale arrives and is told by Debbie that a girl was just murdered. the next day, while Randy, Dewey and Gale are discussing who could be the murderer could be, The killer calls Gales cell phone, Randy answers and says that the killer can see them. Dewey and Gale look around for the killer while Randy keeps him talking on the cellphone. Randy is then pulled into Gales van from behind and stabbed to death.Meanwhile Sidney, receives an instant message from the killer saying that she is going to die that night.While the two bodyguards search the library. Sidney stands near the stairway. Cotton corners her and asks her about an interview that they could do, then gets rather angry at her when she refuses, and when he yells at her in the library he's arrested and all of them go to the police station. Sidney finds out about Randy's death, and Cotton is released from lack of evidence against him.Sidney and her best friend,Hallie, are told that they will be moved to a safe location until the killer is found. Derek says that he will wait for Sidney, then when Sidney is out of sight the phat boys take him to the theater because Derek gave Sidney his ""letters"".they tie him to a prop, have a small party around him and then leave him there. Sidney regrets having to leave, but thinks it'd be better. But then the killer shows up crashes the car, kills the two detectives and then while trying to escape kills Hallie. Sidney runs back to the college.Dewey and Gale are attacked while looking for evidence of the killer identity, Dewey is attacked and the killer, unable to reach gale, runs off. Gale timidly goes out looking for help when she runs into Cotton. Then she starts to back away as she sees the blood all over his hands. Cotton frantically tries to tell her that he found Dewey and tried to help him. She runs out of the building and up to a pay phone that Debbie salt is talking on and calls the police telling them the murderer is Cotton.Sidney runs into the theater and onto the stage looking for someone. Then The set starts moving, and Derek is revealed still tied to the prop, drunk and out cold. Then as she begins to untie him, The killer steps onto the stage and pulls off his mask. Its Mickey, he pulls out a gun and says that without Derek there, hes been having to do all the killing that night. Sidney stops untieing Derek, Derek shouts that he not the killer and while swearing at Mickey, Mickey shoots him dead. As Mickey is explaining that he intends on blaming the movie for his actions, Gale walks in Followed by Debbie Salt who is holding a gun at her. Debbie salt tells them that she is Billy's mother. She then shoots Mickey down, Mickey shoots Gale, who falls into a large gap between the stage and the stairs leading to the audience's seats.Sidney runs away backstage and starts making the sets and props fall on Debbie, who is trying to shoot her. Then Debbie tackles her and puts a knife to her throat. They hear a gunshot during their fight, they look and see Cotton(who has Mickeys discarded gun). He is aiming it at Debbie. Sidney explains that Debbie is Billys mother and that the dead guy on the floor is the other killer. Debbie says that if Cotton lets her kill Sidney, then he'll be the one in the spotlight. Cotton tells Sidney that Debbie does have a point. Sidney looks unbelievably at him. Then he says that the interview is looking pretty good right now. Sidney says to consider it done. Cotton shoots Debbie in the lung. Then as Sidney and Cotton are looking at Debbie, Gale appears and it helped out of the Gap by Cotton while Sidney picks up the other gun. Mickey springs up and Gale and Sidney finish him with a couple of bullets, then Sidney shoots Debbie in the forehead. ""just to make sure"".In the morning Dewey, who is found alive to Gale happiness, is taken to the hospital. Cotton finally gets his spotlight for being the hero and Sidney walks out in the press waiting for her.all in all this movie is pretty cool. It tells us that it's not always wise to make a sequel, by making a sequel.",Scream 2
311,FischMan-2,Ugggh,1,29 December 1998,"I saw this movie the day it came out because a bunch of my friends asked me to go and I wasn't doing anything. I wish I had been. I wasn't a big fan of the original, and this one has made me lose almost all faith in horror/slasher movies altogether.I would probably blame it on realism. As with most horror movies, the killers don't follow any known psychcological profile of a serial killer. And something that bothers me moreso is the way that it is referred to as a copycat killer, when that is not what it actually is, although it appears that way at the beginning.It had some good puns in it, but those couldn't help fix the rest of it. I chose to not go to a party once because I found out that they were going to be watching this movie there. I can't stand it. I've said it before and I'll say it again, if you want a fantastic horror/slasher movie, rent Hitchcock's ""Psycho.""",Scream 2

Sidney and Randy are now attending Windsor College and are trying to lead a normal life. However when two students are murdered at the sneak preview of Stab, a film based on the events in Scream, Sidney and Randy along with Gale and Dewey realise that there is a wacked out copycat killer on the loose who is desperate to finish what was started in Scream.  This film was definately scarier and more jumpy than the first film perhaps because I saw this in the cinema and saw the original on video.  However I still reckon the first one was better.  Having said that this was very well made and had some excellent death scenes plus some great in-jokes so chances are if you like the first one you will like this.",Scream 2

Before the movie started I did not have high expectations for ""Scream 2"", which is probably why I loved this movie. Although it did not have the amazing opening scene or as original of a twist as the first one, ""Scream 2"" still delivered. The same people that survived in the first film are back but this time Sid is at college. I ended up jumping more in this movie than I did in the original. This movie had some intense scenes, such as the car scene were the killer is knocked out and Sid and her roommate have to climb over him. Also, this movie had dramatic points that actually made me feel bad. I throughly enjoyed this movie considering most horror sequels are just ridiculous, but ""Scream 2"" is quite the exception.

Now from a long distance perspective Scream 2 wasn't too bad.  I mean her boyfriend in this one is hot and the scene with him on the cross and her going through some serious doubts was well done I thought.  A for effort. You knew the ""but"" part was coming.  Scream 2 was okay but...COME ON!!!  I give full pardons to those characters who have not been in Scream 1 and have not been...heretofore...chased by a raving psychopath with a knife.  Think about this seriously folks.  It's school time and you've just gotten rid of...barely... a murderous duo who slashed half of your friends and acquaintances.  What is you summer activity most likely going to be?  That's right boys and girls...martial arts training and marksmanship training.  You would also be carrying around...IF NOTHING ELSE FOR CRYING OUT LOUD.. a can of mace. Okay those thoughts aside.  Say maybe these characters are not going to let the violence of society turn them hard and coarse. Fair enough I can respect the pacifist's viewpoint.  But for god's sake it starts happening again and you just casually hang around.  A danger to you friends and significant others?  No my friends you would get a car...check all the trunks back seats etc.  Get in your car and drive.  Where?  Who cares somewhere else where your friends are not going to get hurt.  I mean she essentially was the cause of both her roommate's and her boyfriend's murder.  Sigh.  Just had to get that off my chest.  I'll probably watch Scream 3 if it comes out too. hoping against hope that one of the characters picks up a gun before the end when it's basically pointless.",Scream 2

I had high hopes when I went to see this movie in local theatre, and most of the hopes came true: great action, fantastic slasher scenes, etc.... But I already knew in the first half hour who were the killers, and that's not so great. But that isn't the worst thing of this movie... cause that would be the ending. Never in my life have I ever seen such a forced ending in a movie. Where Scream 1 was a parody on all horror movies, scream 2 was a parody on Scream itself... But overall, I rated it a 8 because of the frightening scenes in it. But believe me, this sequel isn't worthy at all to the original, fantastic Scream.

Better, I would give Scream a 7/10 but this i would give a 9/10. One of the killers was easy to spot but the other was very surprising. The first killers in the original were obvious from the beginning. Thats why i liked Scream 2 so much; because it was a surprise. It was more interesting than the first, plus the acting was better than in any on the series of Scream films. Sequels are not usually better than the original so that was another surprise too with this over average film. Why does everyone think this film is bad??? its interesting, (more interesting than first at least). Sequels, Sequels, Sequels, why does nobody think sequels are good? Not all are.

The first Scream, obviously, was a by-the-books horror film that worked, because it knew its own tricks, but fell into them anyway. Very post-modern. But Scream 2, in my opinion, is more of a comedy. The opening scene at the movie theatre is a hilarious send-up of the weird phenomenon that the original film became. The movie satirizes Hollywood and the media, showing how truly ridiculous it can be when the press latches on to a particular tragic story, blowing it out of proportion until it becomes less about the people involved and more about the very fact that it even happened. I, for one, loved many of the little in-jokes (""it was my head on Jennifer Aniston's body""). Granted, we'll have to explain them to our kids when they catch it on USA twenty years from now, but no one ever said it was timeless. And yes, the ending is weird and forced (though i do love the line, ""bob dole on the witness stand, IN MY DEFENSE"") and lacks the surprise of the original.

The script was genius, the characters were genius, it was overall a great movie. We were all wondering ""Where is this new, fresh franchise gonna take us next?"" And that's when we got Scream 2.Scream 2 is Scream 1... In college. Let me ask you if this sounds familiar. A dragged-out, suspenseful start where Drew Barrymore gets killed. We get that, but with Jada Pinkett Smith in a movie theater. Remember how in the first movie the biggest suspect was the boyfriend? I will give this movie props for not doing exactly that, as it turns out the boyfriend isn't the killer, but, come on, we all saw that coming. Remember when we though Dewey died, but he didn't? Well, that happened in this one, too. But the worst similar plot point of them all is... THERE IS TWO KILLERS. AGAIN. Except this time, it's Timothy Olyphant, and Billy's (the killer from the first movie) mother. And guess what? There's a dragged-out climax, where when we think the killer's dead, she comes back to life and gets shot in the head. Isn't that just unique?The best sequels are the ones that are original, while also keeping the first movie and continuity in mind. Toy Story 2, The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather Part 2. Scream 2 just takes that philosophy, rips it up into tiny little pieces, and throws it into the fireplace.

(especially : The cop car scene, CiCi's phone ordeal, Stab : The Movie (very original) and just about the whole film)But like all movies, it has to have a flaw (2 infact)1 : It could focus more on the smaller characters like Halli, CiCi, Mickie, Randy and Joel and 2 : The killers sucked !!!

330,bernie369,A good sequel which parodies sequels,5,14 July 2005,"To be honest, let me say first that though Scream 2 is a common sequel, I like it because it makes fun of itself. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson bring in some new characters like Sidney's new boyfriend Derek Feldman (well played by Jerry O'Connell) but also some already known characters get a bigger part this time. The best example is Cotton Weary (very believable played by Liev Schreiber), but also Randy Meeks (again cool performance of Jamie Kennedy) can be seen again.Of course there some other new characters too but the you will soon recognize that the focus lies on Sidney, Dewey and Gale (Neve Campell, David Arquette and Courtney Cox).I don't think it makes any sense watching it without having seen the first part cause there are many references to it.In the very beginning of the movie Wes Craven also makes fun of or rather accuses the behaviour of the fans of splatter-movies. They are personated as violence-seeking almost mad crowd who can't wait to see some people getting slaughtered. A very shocking way how they are presented and it may be exaggerated but not that unrealistic. It makes you thoughtfully, but of course you don't have to deal with it and an also just enjoy the movie.My résumé is that if you like Scream you'll also like this one, although the only thing that has been approved is the hairstyle of Courtney Cox.",Scream 2

Actually, after first part i expected the same stupid things... I keep wasting my time. I do not recommend to anyone to watch this movie. This movie contains stupid scenes such, when police car crashes when scream is driving, then girls are out. When Cindi is coming back to see who is he, there is no one. Did scream also get out from window??? I do not think it is good idea, and then if he got out from the door, were girls too stupid not to hear it? Scream(s) appear when they need and where they need... I always write short reviews, this time again. Because i do not really want to waste my time for writing long review for this stupid movie..",Scream 2
334,Marisol33,Almost Better than the original,8,6 September 2009,"Wes Craven hits it big again with this amazing sequel! NO one was really expecting this to be better than the original, ( most sequels SUCK ) but this was a much anticipated movie and hit hard hwen it came out. This very closely came to surpassing the original. Sydney still believes that there is a killer waiting to get her, and she's right, with a movie about her life coming out, more muders start to occur. And she soon again finds herself in the middle of vicious murders. And she finds out that it is again a tag team duo, Micky, the freaky film student, and Billy's mother, who also, like her son, seeks good old fashion revenge.... What made this movie so populare was that it took Scream to a new level, bringing in other stars, and having movies inside a movie, and it mixed comedy with horror. Tastefuly, in one of hte first secens, we meet a college class discussing how sequels suck. This all thrown into one makes for a fun movie that is packed with it's share of thrills. I liked the sequel it was better than most sequels turn out however I still prefer the first but it was satisfactory to my demands. The premise of the sequel is that the survivors of the first movie all go on to college as well as three new members to the group and after the movie Stab based on what had happened to them last year came out two people were murdered and they think that they could be next so they are now wondering if it is a person trying to make a real life sequel. I would recommend this to people who have for one thing seen the first movie and liked it. Also if you are going to watch this make sure that you are thirteen or older otherwise it will be to violent for you. Second of all my advice would be for you to watch it with a friend otherwise you may be afraid to pick up the phone if they call. I hope that this review has helped you in making a decision about whether or not you will watch this movie!",Scream 2
335,Dingo-5,WONDERFUL,10,30 July 1998,This is the greatest sequel ever made.  Of course it is part of a trilogy so not quite a true sequel but it still is awesome. Equal if not superior to the original,Scream 2
336,Dingo-5,A hilarious and intense piece of media savvy gold.,10,26 November 1998,"A New ClassicScream 2 is everything a great movie needs.  A great cast (Courtney Cox is perfect as the bitchy Gale Weathers, Sarah Michelle Gellar is beautiful), a great director (Craven gives the film a very cool look and feel), a great writer (Williamson's script is a witty mix of one liners and references). Though not nearly as scary as the first, 'Scream 2' is much more rewatchable and delightful.  This movie will keep you laughing and has some pretty intense scenes.  ""The Cop Car"" scene is very intense yet a great one liner. Wes Craven's best film that can juggle comedy and horror in such a media savvy way.",Scream 2
337,Dingo-5,wonderful,10,9 August 1998,"The killer is not predictable because there was no way to tell who it was.  This movie is not horribly gory.  It is witty, funny and suspense filled a must see",Scream 2

So I gave it a solid 8/10. My only real complaint was the survival of the Gail Weathers character she just irritates me. So in a way that must make Courtney Cox a good actress. As for the rest of the movie the pace is well balanced with a good mix of suspence and a good twist as far as the second ghost was. It is also a good movie to see rising stars like Joshua Jackson and Rebecca Grayhart.",Scream 2
339,JustBo,"Scream all over again, only bigger and bloodier",10,30 March 2007,"I thought Scream 2 wasn't really a bad movie, but It did remind of the original (and better) Scream a little bit too much, making it VERY predictable, plus I definitely think they should have killed off a lot more key characters.But the overall setting is good, the acting is 'okey' and the murders are definitely the highlight of this film, few and far apart, but the kills were more graphic and gory then the first! You get all your stabbings, head stabbings, head impalings, slashed throat and bullet wounds.Nice job! This one might just also have one of the coolest and suspenseful chase scenes EVER involving the character of Gale.Watch it for the gore, but don't expect a slasher classic like the first.",Scream 2
340,spotlessmind03,As Good a Sequel as There Ever Could Be,7,4 January 2011,"Where Kevin Williamson's screenplay drew upon the rules of slasher movies as an inspiration for a teen killer in ""Scream"", his script for the sequel in turn recognizes the rules and traditions of popular horror sequels and references itself constantly as being aware of this status.""Scream 2"" isn't as well put together as the first but director Wes Craven manages to make a pretty scary and intriguing horror romp out of Williamson's script, cleverly mixing scares and in-joke humor together to rush out a sequel to one of the greatest teen horror satires ever. There are real moments of terror in the story, which finds Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) once again dealing with a psycho slasher in a ghost mask who is stalking her and her close friends in a pleasant Ohio college town. Courteney Cox reprises her role as reporter Gale Weathers, who turned out to be an unexpected hero in ""Scream"" and returns to gain more fame, capitalizing on the murders taking place at Sidney's school. David Arquette also returns as the funny Deputy Dewey and his scenes with Gale are some of the best comic moments in the film. The cast is better in this sequel, and besides the main trio of Campbell, Cox and Arquette, Jamie Kennedy returns as movie buff Randy, and you've also got appearances by Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jada Pinkett Smith, Jerry O'Connell, and even the always delightful Laurie Metcalfe (of ""Roseanne"" fame) in a hilarious cameo role as an aspiring reporter.Where the film is overlong, it proves itself to be an ultimately entertaining and clever retread of the first. ""Scream 2"" still takes the time to establish its characters and environment before people start getting picked off by the killer. Wes Craven has an eye for scary chase scenes and these are the highlight of the film. Among these are a jolting car chase, a clever revamp of the opening from the first film set in a sorority house, and even a surprise moment of horror in a crowded movie theater at the premiere of ""Stab"", ironically, a film within a film gimmick based on the events of the first film. It's touches like this that keep ""Scream 2"" above routine slasher material, but not for long. The twist (that is to say, who ""Ghostface"" actually turned out to be) was genuinely unexpected, even more so than the first, and echoes some classic twists from earlier films in the genre that inspired ""Scream"" itself. Craven is still at the top of his game stylistically but it doesn't get much better than the original ""Scream"".",Scream 2

Body counts begin to tally and so does the investigation. The list of suspects grows, most of the old characters make it back. (Even one of the dead ones makes a cameo. Durring a party scene at a ""martini mixer"", Mathew Lillard is in the background. Blonde hair, glasses. Apparently he and Neve were dating. Some guys get all the luck.) The bad guy reveal was a little cheesy, but it is a good movie all the way. Not as good as the original, but stands on its own.",Scream 2

In 20 years time people are going to be talking about how good it still is much like how the original Halloween, Friday The 13th and A Nighmare On Elm Street are still good.  Scream was very good that film, in Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson re-created the slasher ganre and in fine style but Scream 2 took the next step to the hall of fame of slasher movies.  The story line of the second one is so much better than the original it is not funny.  With Kevin Williamson now starting work on the 3rd Scream to finish his and Wes Craven's involved in creating the next great slasher movies.  Of course even though Wes and Kevin will not be involved in making a 4,5 or 6, I think we know that Mirmax will not stop at just 3 Scream's but Mirmax will have to go on and create 6 or 7 of them.  If the 3rd one is half as good as Scream 2 it will be a great film.  Everyone go and see Scream 2 Now.",Scream 2

The ending was suspenseful, as was the scene with Ci-Ci (played by the gorgeous Sarah Michelle Gellar) in her house. The movie mixes suspense with humour wonderfully. A great movie. Kevin Williamson has done a great job to make a horror sequel that has kept up with the original. No other horror film has done that. Brilliant work.",Scream 2
347,ca-2,Mildly amusing,6,28 February 1999,"The humor was enough to carry the movie... barely.  It's really just another plot-lacking slasher flick.  The only difference is this one doesn't take itself too seriously.  If you really want to rent a horror movie, go rent something like Carrie, the Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, or even the original Hellraiser.  If you just want a mindless slasher movie so you can laugh with your buddies, then sure, rent Scream 2.  There are a lot of inside jokes, so it helps if you've seen the original.",Scream 2
348,markb-14,A few shocks but lacked a good mystery,7,25 July 1999,"Some sequels require you to see the original movie before you really understand what the sequel is all about.  Well, I saw Scream about a year ago, and I still didn't follow some of Scream 2.This movie (like the original) did not live up to its name.  It didn't make me scream.  Yes there were scares, and I found myself at times shouting ""Don't do it!"" to these stupid college girls who seem to lack common sense in the face of impending death.Despite the plot being obviously focused for screams and laughs only and nothing more intelligent, this film did have me gripped.  But I still believe Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson need to learn an important lesson.  The more credible the story, the more frightening it's going to be.As with the original, the end of the movie was a let-down.  Revealing the identity of the serial killers in a classic ""I'm now going to explain exactly why I've been killing everybody"" scenario smothers the atmosphere so carefully crafted.  Whatever happened to mystery and suspense?",Scream 2
349,Fiorno68,Lacking the edge of the original,6,11 July 2000,"On the bright side, Scream 2 only suffers from a few major flaws. Unfortunately, the biggest problem is: It's not scary.  While the humor is up to par with the first Scream, this one lacks the tension to bridge the media-savvy jokes and one-liners.  Some of the characters appear paper-thin- a pitfall Scream had successfully dodged.  Lastly, the ending seemed to fall flat: cheesy, unrealistic, and thrill-less.  But all that aside, this is still an entertaining film.  It is well crafted, generally well acted, and witty.  Furthermore, it adds something new to the trilogy, and really, that is all that is required of it.",Scream 2

I cannot say that I liked this film better or worse than the first one, but I can define some of the points I liked and disliked.First of all, I liked that this movie had more of a plot to it.  The original just kind of went along without much of a story, but the killer(s) in this movie actually had a real motive.   It was not as graphic as the original ""Scream.""I did not like this movie because it was not as scary as the first.  It tried to copy some of the original scares, but everybody was used to them already.  They tried to make the beginning better, but it did not have as much of an effect on people.All in all, I liked this movie.  If you were a fan of the first movie, and even if you were not, I recommend renting it.  You should see the first movie first, because it goes back and the mystery has to do with the original killings.  Most people did not like it as well, but I still recommend renting it.",Scream 2
351,Cotton69,Cotton Returns!!!,10,13 February 2000,"What made this movie so good was that Cotton Weary had a major part in this film.

354,theendisnear1985,Even worse the second time around.,2,6 May 2010,"""Scream 2"" is a movie that asks you to believe another serial killer has targeted young Sidney Prescott (survivor of the first film, and now a college student). If this weren't enough to swallow, her high school friend and fellow survivor from the first film, Randy, conveniently goes to the same university. And wouldn't you know it, along come the other remaining survivors, so now everyone can play along in another round of the same old game. How convenient, eh? Once again, the killer is able to accomplish many things by seemingly pure, blind luck (only in the movies). The opening of the film is a laughable exercise of a series of implausible events that lead to the first deaths in the movie, kick-starting an entire series of conveniences for the killer to do his work aided as if by the gods of Hollywood themselves. Characters manage to get into situations that would only happen in the movies, and the killer is presented with opportunities to chase our poor survivors down school corridors and alleys, all making great scenes that belong right in a movie, yet ironically the characters are self-aware of all the clichés even when they are a part of them.",Scream 2

I suspected Mickey from the early beginning, and don't get me wrong, Mickey is the best Scream killer. It was just predictable. Mrs.Loomis was a good turnout to be the second killer, but I just didn't believe it.Good movie, good story, good acting. Not scary, but it is hard to make a movie scary today.

It was still suspenseful, and had that horror movie element to it that made the first scream so good. The acting, just got better, Neve, Courteney, and David play their roles exquisitely, and i can't imagine other actors in the roles of Sidney, Gale, and Dewey.

Gellar stands out as always as the doomed CiCi Cooper. ""Do you want to die tonight CiCi?"" Doesn't it just give you chills?

It is symbolic in most of its features, as strongly demonstrated by the real killer, who is, or seems to be a journalist. Craven and Williamson also underline how media, and not violent movies, can bring young generation to psychic disease. It is not a case that Gale Weathers renounces to her scoop for Linus (it is symbolic, not sentimental). Wonderful, of course the scene in the studios where, behind a glass, Gale meets Linus' hand.

Apart from that minor flaw, 'Scream 2' is fantastic.It has just as much suspense but the film doesn't trap you like the first one did. It had as much, maybe even more gore than the original. Plus, more killings can't be too bad. Craven does a good job at the directing and Williamson does well with the script, making it hip and interesting.If you liked the original 'Scream' then you should check the sequel out...you probably wont be disappointed.Scream 2: 9/10",Scream 2

378,rachel89,Not so scary,8,17 October 2007,"This wasn't so scary, and i'm not a huge fan of horror films because i usually hate them. This one was different, except for one scene. The deaths were mediocre, except the one of Randy Meeks. The shock tactic of the reactions before the reveal of the bloodied body was brilliant. The others weren't as bad. It was a really good twist at the end, fantastic way to include revenge in it. Plenty of Red Herrings and bucket-loads of blood. Not seen the first or last yet, but this has to be my favourite horror film to date.Some of the actors were mediocre, whilst others were fantastic as the characters. Jamie Kennedy as Randy Meeks and David Arquette as Dewey Riley...fantastic!",Scream 2
379,Mrperfect125,"love it, no i mean it, i 100% loved it so much!!!",10,10 September 2007,"introduction title-Scream 2cast:David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Jamie Kennedy, Laurie Metcalfe, Elise Neal, Jerry O' Connell, Timothy Olyphant, Jada Pinkett Smith, Omar Epps, Liev Schreiber, Lewis Arquette, Duane Martin, Portia De Rossi, Rebbeca Gayheart, Heather Graham, Tori Spelling, Luke Wilson, Philip Pavel and Christopher Doyle.i think this sequel to the first scream is far amazing and better than the first and it involves new characters but eventually killed by the killer. the scenes that i like was that Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) and Hallie McDaniel (Elise Neal) struggles to get out of the police car with the killer inside and the impaled body of Officer Richards (Christopher Doyle) outside and another one was when the second killer, Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalfe) was nearly hit by the sets on the stages.here are the list of deaths: 1.Phil Stevens (Omar Epps)-stabbed at the ear 2.Maureen Evans (Jada Pinkett Smith)-stabbed 7 times to death 3.Casey 'Cici' Cooper (Sarah Michelle Gellar)-stabbed at the back and then thrown to the ground 4.Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy)-stabbed 4 times to death 5.Officer Andrews (Philip Pavel)-throat slit violently 6.Officer Richards (Christopher Doyle)-violently impaled on the head with a large metal pole after a car crashes 7.Hallie McDaniel (Elise Neal)-stabbed on the heart multiple times 8.Derek Feldman (Jerry O' Connell)-shot at the heart with a handgun 9.Mickey Altieri (Timothy Olyphant)-shot multiple times by Sidney and Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) 10.Debbie Salt (Laurie Metcalfe)-shot at the neckthe thing that i like about this movie is because it's more bloody and gory,it's more scary and frightening. i give a rating A- because scream 2 is the best sequel ever.The movie started when a young couple Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens were brutally murdered at a cineplex watching the sneak preview of a movie called 'Stab'. Stab is the movie telling about what happened on the previous Scream. It was also based on the book 'The Woodsboro Murders' and was written by the tabloid twit Gale Weathers. After that Sid ney aware that it's happening again. On this movie, also there's the movie geek Randy Meeks, the lovable and huggable Dewey Riley (David Arquette) and cute Sidney Prescott.Also, in the scene where Cici is stalked by the killer and was killed is very similar to the previous Scream scene where Casey Becker and her boyfriend were stalked and murdered. Finally, the killers were finally revealed to be Mickey Altieri and Debbie Salt, whom is the mother to the previous killer Billy Loomis. The car scene is quite intense and scary indeed. I really don't like the scene where Sidney playing as Cassandra on a play and saw the killer. So that's all, and i really appreciate Scream so much because it was very entertaining. The Scream 2 can really need a little bit of improvement.",Scream 2
380,manuup2007,okay sequel,6,27 October 2007,"well I'm quite fond of the scream franchise, i will say scream 2 would be second rate out of the trilogy. it shows all the cast of the original reprising their roles, the character I'm most fond of is Courtney cox's(Gail weathers). the story is a bit weak towards the original and the scares are not as good as the first. but it is enjoyable to watch. i like the way they cast Sarah Michelle gellar in the film but not the way they killed her off, i think she is good in horror films. it is bloodier than the first, the good part of the story i like is when the trio find out when the firsts killers mother is the killer in this and the tense finale. my actually favorite scene in the film is when dooy and Gail meet up again for the first time in the film and the music playing compliments it, all in all the film is okay,if it was more scary and more like the original,the story is good but the scare factor should be better. its good but not great.",Scream 2

For anyone who has not seen the film I must warn you not to read on as a go over the events of the film for there will be spoilers.WARNING: SPOILERS!!!  DO NOT READ ON IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!!!!!! SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS
""SCREAM 2"" picks-up two years after the conclusion of the first film. The series heroine, Sydney Prescott is in college trying to live a normal life when two people are murdered at a sneak preview of ""Stab"", which is a horror movie based on what happened in the last movie according to surviving character, Gale Weathers.  Suddenly survivors of ""Scream"" are brought together when a copycat killer attacks them and murderers classmates. Like in the first film you are left guessing who the killer or killers are until the end. The film is darker than its predesessor and lacks a bit of the magic which made ""Scream"" such a fun, thrilling and original film.  The infamous phone voice was dull this time around, not scary or interesting as it was in the first one.  The ending is also a little off.  While I find it reasonable or exceptable that Mrs. Loomis,(mother of killer Billy Loomis from part 1), was the brains behind her plan for revenge, it wasn't shocking as the revealing of the killers was in the first movie.  The first film tricked you until the end and made two likeable characters turn out to be deranged sickos which made it more effective.  In this film it was just like, 'oh okay your the killers'. But dispite a few things it's still a funny, thrilling sequel and it does fit as a trilogy",Scream 2
382,Jgskywalker89,Not Bad,6,4 March 2007,"Well, Randy, you were right. This sequel definitely did not exceed the expectations of the first Scream. I did like the plot twist with Debbie Salt revealing herself to be Billy's mom. Once again, Neve Campbell does an excellent job portraying her role as Sidney Prescott and Jamie Kennedy as the movie geek yet comical, Randy Meeks. But, I was very disappointed about the fact that they killed off Randy was the biggest mistake. I thought the trilogy would have been much better if they let him live and get Sid and kill off either Gale or Dewey. Plus the dialogue was not too great and Mickey's motive was just plain stupid. Overall I'd give this a 6-6.5/10.",Scream 2
383,KeepsGettingBetter,Don't Expect the First,7,3 June 2012,"Good things: At no point did this movie feel dumb or forced. The plot was very good and the acting was good as well. I enjoyed Gale and Dewey's expanding storyline as well as learning more about Sidney's past with Cotton. The actors I liked in particular were Jamie Kennedy, reprising his role of Randy with much enthusiasm and just plain good acting, and the acting of the killer/killers (I won't reveal who), was just as good as the first installment. The movie was again very satirical, like a Scream movie should be. Also, I cannot stress this enough, the character development is phenomenal. There are two deaths in particular in the movie where I definitely felt something. Not necessarily because the deaths were brutal (which they were) but because I actually felt something for the characters. Things that were lacking: It was supposed to be more violent and gory, but I don't feel that it was. At times the chase scenes with the killer got kind of boring, in my opinion. I felt the suspense was a little different, and the movie itself didn't feel like a classic horror movie like the first and it didn't feel like the first movie either. But I guess we shouldn't expect it to. As a fan of the first one, the second one might be a little disappointing but is still definitely worth a watch as an entry to this fantastic franchise.I won't give this an 8 because I don't feel that it's quite an 8. Maybe a 7.5?",Scream 2
384,HPYpinkpanda129,A great trilogy,6,30 July 2006,"I love the Scream trilogy. The sequel to the terrific horror saga ""Scream"" was a good movie. I think that everyone should watch all three movies ""Scream 1, 2, 3"". All together they're a great set and great casting. However, I'd say that Scream 2 is my least favorite out of all three. But if you want to know the whole story it's a must see. One of the best things about this film is that Sarah Michelle Gellar is a part of the cast. She's a great actress and worth watching. She has one of the best death scenes in the movie. It's very important to watch the first one before Scream 2 and 3, you'll get more out of it if you do. Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson are phenomenal creating one of the most chilling horror films of the late 90's.",Scream 2

Once upon a time Wes Craven used to think originals plots, but now... my God!! A really must-to-see film If you're studying cinema and you want to learn how not to make plots, the institutionalized Microsoft Word ""Cut and Paste"" from older films. Anyway, one of the best examples of A.J.F.C (American Junk Food Cinema)... why miss it if you want to expect all? why miss it if you're tired of the surprises of Life and you want to enjoy the most expectable scenes in the history of Cinema? I think brothers Lumière would have destroyed their invention if they had known so that it was going to be used. I'm talking to you now, Craven: set a vegetable store and the brains will thank you.

The first one was good. Real good. But this one just sucked.They plot was just dumb. Reveng, talk about dull. We never even met Billy's mom in the first movie. We all knew that she never cared about him. Why would she need to avenge his death. Wow. This was just bad. I also hate how Randy did not get Sid. He survived the first time. He should have got her.Overall I would not waste your time watching this bad bad movie. I am not even sure why I wasted my time watching it. I think Randy said it the best in the movie. Segels always suck. There is never one as good as the first. Billy and Stu were the only ones that could kill right. They should have left it at that.",Scream 2
387,lilmikey42291,Scream 2 is pretty good,8,18 April 2006,"Scream 2 is undoubtfully very inferior to the first Scream, but is actually quite superior to the other big horror movie of 1997 I Know What You Did Last Summer (also written by Kevin Williamson). We all know what happened so here's my grade for Scream 2.ACTING: Great performances from the returning cast (David Arquette, Neve Campbell, Jamie Kennedy, and Courteney Cox) Sarah Michelle Gellar was also good as was Jada Pinkett and Omar Epps. However, I wasn't fond of Jerry O'Connell, Elise Neal, or Laurie Metcalf. Everyone else was decent. 8/10 SCRIPT: Not as hip or scary as the original without question. I liked the sequel discussion though, but the end was a bit weird as was the beginning (I mean come on no one can get away with murder in a movie theater and if one of the killers moved out on their son, why would she kill for him) ARGH! There were parts about this movie that just annoyed me. 8/10 GORE: A lot less than the original. 6/10 SUSPENSE: Really I only found the end and the car scene to be truly suspenseful. Every else while not dull was OK. 7/10 SCORE: The same as Scream pretty much which was great and the songs chosen were great too. 10/10 OVERALL: 8/10Extras were great on DVD too.",Scream 2
388,bruingal-28746,Beginning Scene is Too Unrealistic,3,13 July 2016,"The beginning scene at the sneak preview of ""Stab"" is too unreal. No ONE behaves like that inside a theater room; people running around with fake knives, throwing popcorn at the screen, and acting like it's a playground. Second, WHY would a horror film based on real murders allow masks and fake knives inside the theater ? It's common sense. I just find it too unrealistic and cheesy. You don't put people in danger by handing out killer's masks, making it way too easy for actual murders and/or dangerous activity to take place. Don't get me wrong, I love Wes Craven and re-watching 90s flicks, but the only thing making this film tolerable is Gale's character and Deputy Dewy.",Scream 2
389,Mark152009,Scream 2 is awesome,8,8 December 2005,"Scream 2 is an amazing movie! I have just recently watched it, and I thought I would tell you guys about it. Well, first of all, I loved the opening sequence with Jada Pinkett. I think that the SCREAM movies have a way of making you really feel sorry for it's victims. I was really surprised when Sarah Michelle Gellar (Cici) was killed so early in the movie. In my opinion, Cici was my favorite character in the SCREAM 2 movie. I thought it was really cool how she was incredibly calm while she was on the phone with the killer. I really loved her death scene. I mean, to get pushed through a window, stabbed two times, and then thrown off of the balcony onto concrete. I mean, that was a death scene right there. I was surprised, but happy about Randy's death scene. I am not a really big fan of Randy, and when he died, I heaved a sigh of relief. I do have a few dislikes about SCREAM 2. I really did not like the whole acting thing for Sidney. I thought it was boring. I wasn't at all surprised with the killers. I knew right off that Debbie Salt would be a killer, but i didn't know her motive. It all fit together when I found out that she was Mrs. Loomis. If you look at Mickey in the classroom, you can just tell that he looks like a killer. So I was not at all surprised when Mickey and Debbie Salt were the killers. I loved it in the end where Cotton saved the day. Cotton is one of my favorites. Everyone knows that is very rare that a sequel can overpass it's original. I'm so sorry, SCREAM 2 fans, but SCREAM is way better.",Scream 2

392,iris-7,Even worse than the first!,1,1 November 1998,"This movie was simply long and boring, not to mention, a waste of my time. It was similar to the first Scream in TOO many ways which made it predictable and not too suspenseful.  However, I did think this movie was horrifying, in a way that ""I wanted 2 hours of my life back!"" If there were to be yet a another sequel, I would not bother wasting my time. This movie was not very enjoyable at all.",Scream 2

The cast Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette, Jamie Kennedy, Jerry O'Connell, Jada Pinkett and many more makes this thriller come to life.

By the time I managed to see the sequel I had seen it about 15 times.  My first thoughts were sequels never live up to the standard of the original but I`ll go and see this anyway(as Randy would say ""sequels are inferior films"").  I was amazed to have watched a sequel that actually was as good as its predecessor.  The elements of whodunnit was as strong as Scream,  The comedy probably better,  the gore as good as and most importantly the story was fantastic as was scream.  I order everybody to go and see this masterpiece and then buy it.  Hurry up with Scream 3 please, I want more!!!! Do you like scary movies?",Scream 2
395,jackal-29,This is what a sequel is all about...,10,8 January 1999,"The best damn movie of 1997, and cross over to 1998, as one of the best films of the year. Scream 2, is not so much like the first, as it is self reflecting, it, still has the same smart wit that the first had, with a lot of new faces, and a great story, and plot, and unlike the first which i love, this movie will have you asking yourself who the killer, or killers are... I went with like 6 people, and only one guess one of the killers, right, and he had no idea who the 2nd killer was, so this movie delivers, i just hope the 3rd is as good, cus i know kevin williamson, and wes craven have out done themselves with SCREAM 1, and 2. Personally i can't wait for part 3, and oh yea neve campbell is so hot, she makes J.L.H from i still know... Look ugly, i'm like in love with neve, anything she is in is awesome, she has not made a bad movie yet the closest she has gotten was ""wild things"" which came close but was still pretty good, and worth watching, but neve is my scream queen, hell she is just my queen, i hope she is in part 3, cus i'd love to see what they do to the character of Sidney Prescott...I want to scream again.",Scream 2
396,juicy1,Sorry but Thumbs down.,1,19 January 1999,I watched the film Scream and I was very impressed in the way the film was structured. The way they jumped right in to the action at the start of the move. This film kept your interest the whole time and i was on the edge of my set.However Scream 2 was rubbish. This film lacked originality and to be honest was a complete bore. The film was to predictable and lacked vision and plot. Sorry but for me this film was not worth the watch.,Scream 2
397,drusilla-3,Even more twisted than the first one.,10,16 February 1999,The story starts off with two people standing in line to see the movie which is basically the novelisation of the book that Gail Weathers wrote. The story moves on to Sidney Prescott (played by Neve Cambell) who gets a call identical to the one she gets in the first Scream. The film is very twisted and at times very unbelievable but its still a good horror film despite an unrealistic ending. The best killing scene is probably on the balcony of a sorority.,Scream 2
398,Tiger-97,Extremely disappointing.,6,5 April 1999,"I enjoyed the first ""Scream"" a lot, and when the sequel came out I was desperate to see it. It was a big disappointment though. Just about all of its chase scenes were very short and not even a quarter as witty as the first one's. They were therefore pathetic,except at the end when Sydney fought back. In fact,sometimes there were no chase scenes. Another thing is that the background music of ""Scream 2"" was not half as good as the background music of the original. Whereas in the original,you had a wide variety of great music,in ""Scream 2"" you have the same music over and over again.",Scream 2
399,M!CH@EL,"As good, if not better than the first.",9,13 June 1999,"'Scream 2' is as good if not better than the original. Some won't agree but it is bursting with originality, suspense and shocks.It is far more self referential and extremely clever - looking at if violent films can influence viewers to commit violent crimes, analysis of the media, the effects of the first on the surviving characters.Okay, I'll admit the opening scene and the killer revelations don't match up to the first 'Scream' but could they ever? The film is still packed with tense scenes. The scenes of Gale in the sound recording studio and Sidney and Hallie trapped in the car are pure tension.The film manages to stay fresh despite this being Ghostface's second outing and I hope it stays this way for the third and final installment.The film is totally enjoyable. It is one of my favourite ever films and definitely my favourite ever sequel. Kevin Williamson is a modern day writing genius and Wes Craven gives the film a good pace and times the shocks just right.In closing,the film is witty, clever, scary, jumpy, gory and the characters are likeable. What more could anyone ask for? Recommended.",Scream 2
400,slick-35,What the hell are you all on?,10,12 April 1999,"I'm sorry but I have to disagree with nearly everyone else on this page, I personally think Scream 2 surpasses Scream in almost every department. The only place where the original wins is in the music. The story, characters, humour, Scare factor and the rest, are all a lot stronger in Scream 2, so if you enjoy a laugh and a scare in the same film go and see Scream 2 over Scream I guarantee you'll enjoy it more.",Scream 2
401,Skewthat,One Sharp Spoof,10,10 April 1999,"In order to fully understand/enjoy a movie like scream 2 you must understand its intentions.  Kevin Williamson was a truly avid fan of cheesy 80's horror, with its cliches and vague hints.  Williamson's intention with this movie was, like in Scream, a mix of these cliches and few but clever clues about who the real killer(s) is. For someone like myself who has, to some extent unfortunately, seen many of these films this film was a delight. I don't know a greater movie going experience than to sit with close,intelligent friends and try not only to guess the ending but things such as timing (which Wes Craven adds his talents) and to revel in joy when those around see your dorky 'skills'. For those who are avid mystery/horror fans this is not just a movie but a test of skills. For those who are not the exprience will be great but not on the same level, One reason the movie will get mixed reviews",Scream 2

I and my family like this movie so mush that we purchased it.It is an excellent movie if you love horror movies. I love Scream 2, and I figure you all must too if you are reading this comment.  There were some parts in the movie that I didn't care for though.I also did not like all of the cursing that was involved in the movie.  I do not like cursing at all.

The opening seen is cool. There is a couple of seens that are drawn out a little too much, but all in all plenty of chills and laughs. It was a good sequal the 3rd one is a better overall story and gives closure.",Scream 2
408,kenny_k,Better than the first!,10,4 July 2000,"Like they said in the film, there are exceptions to the rule that the sequel doesn't every come up to par with the original. Well, this is the exception for many reasons. SCREAM 2 is longer and more exciting than the first. The mystery is more complicated, and killers are who you'd least expect but makes sense. The script is definitely better than the first. It's definitely more scary and riveting, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. The film goes against the standard horror flick clichés, and at times, the characters are still f-ed! That makes one think: ""What are they going to do now?!"" People actually made sense in this movies in various parts! Something needed in horror movies forever! This is a quality film, and of a higher standard than your average horror flick and higher than of its original. So sit back and enjoy!",Scream 2
409,sunofsun,If you exclude the last 15 minutes...,9,24 August 2000,"then this is the most exciting thriller there's been in years.  Containing some of the most engaging scenes of terror seen in a Slasher film (well, a who done it/Slasher film).   This is the most eerie, dark, creepy instalment of the trilogy.  Loved the pulse pounding soundtrack!  Even the look of the film was stronger than the other two.Frankly, bashing this film and praising the third is enough to make me recommend watching them again.  The third was a watered down, boring, insainly silly, would-be character piece that was a forced and pathetic attempt to link the trilogy together.  Suddendly characters had no backstory.  They said lines to push the story forward.  There was even a lack of Close Ups.  It showed that Craven's interest in the series was wanning.   If the weakness in Scream two is the ending... the weakness in two is everything after it's intense opening.Re: Scream 2, if removing a certain character was too much for you to handle, then that's too bad.  It's called good drama.  I couldn't believe that they did it.  I felt angry, I felt upset... then I realized, exactly how powerful and effective the scene was.On the downside, the last 15 minutes are rather... inept.  Equally as stupid as the ending of the ""Murder she wrote-eqse"" Scream 3.  Recommendation, forget the end... the rest will scare, thrill you and make you laugh.",Scream 2

The people act so stupid. Like the part where the guy walks up to the reporter with blood on his hands and she assumes he's the killer. How stupid can you be? Like the killer is going to walk right up to you with blood all over his hands without a weapon or anything. That would be like confessing to the murders!Yeah, and then the actual killer is not too bright either. He tears off his mask in from of Sidney when he could have just shot her and be done with it. And then, Sidney listens to the guy even though she knows he's a murderer when he says her boyfriend was involved, even though he's hanging from whatever that prop thing was. Come on!

The way the ghostface is shown through the movie is pretty unique and it feels like a scary movie although it's still funny at times, which is nice.
I won't go much into the plot and stuff, but I'd say the movie absolutely a blast to see and this Scream franchise is probably my favorite in terms of the horror genre.
Looking forward to see part 3.",Scream 2
412,smg_ktu,The Domino's Pizza of Horror Movies,7,2 November 2001,"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I intrigued you with the title, huh? But the reason I chose it was the reason I saw this movie in the first place was for ""the most gorgeous woman walking God's green earth,"" namely, Sarah Michelle Gellar as CiCi, but as you can see by the Domino's reference, her performance was done in 30 minutes or less. The rest of the movie was OK, but I was disappointed after CiCi was killed. The whole film went downhill from there for me.",Scream 2
413,kessengers,Great sequel!,8,3 August 2021,"At the time of it's release a lot people I know didn't like it at all. I have no idea why either. The lines are funny, the cast good and it even has it's scary moments. I have no idea why they did part 3 without Kevin Williamson doing the screen-play. His scripts made the movies clever, funny and down to earth. Plus the cast in part 3 is laughable compared to the telented cast in 1 and 2. I mean in this one you got David Arquette ""in no doubt his best role"", Neve Campbell ""in possibly her best role as well"", Courtney Coxx, Liev Shrieber, Jamie Kennedy, Jada Pinkett Smith, Timothy Olyphant ""Go!"", Jerry O'Connell, Omar Epps and Sarah Michelle Gellar. Oh and Roseanne's sister from...Roseanne is in it too. Also look for Joshua Jacksan ""Dawson's Creak"" in a small role as a film class student.",Scream 2
414,reelwood-19378,Best sequel,9,13 August 2021,"I love this flick 2, wasn't sure if I would cause Billy Loomis wouldn't be in the film (it's like chucky without Tiffany it sucks!) Star quality cast with a great psycho twist ( I was actually surprised) My friends wish we could write scary movies or Star in them...So..enjoy.",Scream 2
415,michealdeidre,underrated sequel,8,3 August 2021,"Kevin Williamson was totally a head of his time. Scream 2 uses the same tricks as Scream, but it's matured and even more meta for a post muderspree story. Highly recommend re-watching if you haven't seen it in awhile!",Scream 2
416,greenstemz,Fun sequel,8,15 August 2021,"This movie is a lot of fun and entertaining. Some things don't work of course though. Like how they use Han Zimmer's score from Broken Arrow whenever they show Dewey. Jerry Connell ""singing I think I love you"" to Sydney. Things that make it clever though for example, is when it pokes fun at other movies and even at itself. I like how Timothy Olyphant trys to come up with sequels that out-due the originals to Jamie Kennedy's character. It discusses sequels when it itself is one...trying to out-due the original and in some ways it does.",Scream 2
417,yamiletr-59678,Wish it was shorter,7,13 September 2021,"There were a lot of moments where the film was stronger than the original, but the long run time and (slightly) overstuffed plot drag it down.",Scream 2

419,james-clarke797-1,The Best 'Scream' Movie,10,2 April 2008,"I was a huge fan of the scream series( i first watched scream when i was 9!) and i have to say that this is the best by far. I like both of the other movies, but with 'SCR3AM' i found that it was more funny than scary (Especially Sarahs Death, why would you hide between scream costumes!) and with the first scream, i know its a classic but lets face it, it isn't very scary any more, like Halloween and nightmare on elm street. What i found so scary about this movie is that you can never guess who is going to be killed next, for example, who thought that out of the main movie, Sarah Michelle Geller would die first? I thought that she would be one of the final ones to die, if not one of the survivors. The ending also really surprised me, i thought that the killer(s) would be the sorority sisters, or Hallie ( i thought it would be girls!) my favourite scene had to be either CiCi's death scene, or the scene where gale is chased (and where Dewey appears to be killed) i think that this movie is definitely one of the best i have seen, and i recommend it even if you haven't seen any of the other scream movies! 10/10",Scream 2
420,filipzd,Very good...,10,23 March 2002,"It was an exelent movie, good acting, camera... scary, it's just one good scary movie! This sequel is much better than the first one (Scream), more killing, more blood, scaryer, more interesting and nice. Good work Wes!",Scream 2
421,tkyle48,Scream 2,10,8 July 2010,"This movie is so good. It's like the perfect horror movie. You have equally gore and drama. Which is always great. I cant stand people that don't like this film, it's great. People have forgotten about how great a horror movie can be. Now days, they want, blood, blood, blood, and even more blood. Many horror films now days lack drama, suspense, and a good storyline. If anyone who was born in 2000 till now wont like it because horror movies now don't have story just blood. But if you were born before 2000, then you will love it! Plus it has the biggest stars of the 90s. Jada, Neve, Sarah, Omar, and many, many others. You have Wes Craven you is the master of mixing gore with a good story line, and Kevin Williamson, who is a great writer. I recommend this film if you enjoy horror and gore, with a good storyline and drama.",Scream 2
422,littlebigmano13,The best of the Trilogy...,10,13 July 2004,"Scream 2 was the best movie of the trilogy by far. With the hippest cast, cleverest plot and thrills chills and spills around every corner, Scream 2 not only surpassed the original but was not able to be beat by the sequel that follows it.Once again, Kevin Williamson comes through with a fantastic script with edgy plot lines and twists. The identity of the killer or killers will keep you guessing to the very end. David Arquette, Courtney Cox and Never Campbell reprise their roles of Dewey, Gale and Sidney flawlessly, and Leiv Schreiber, Laurie Metcalf, Jamie Kennedy and Jada Pinkett round off the cast with essential roles played to a ""T""Wes Craven delivers yet again when Sidney Prescott finds herself amidst killings again at while away at Windsor College. The killings coincidentally coincide with the release of ""Stab"", a movie based on the book written by Gale Weathers on the killings two years ago at Woodsboro. Dewey soon appears to find out what is going on and to make sure Sidney and the others are protected as the killings increase until the slam-bang finish which is sure to go down as one of the best in horror movie history.Overall, 9/10",Scream 2
423,ddean-52016,My personal review on Scream 2,7,31 May 2015,"As Far as sequels go Scream 2 does a very good job at upping the Steaks and pays homage to its original. Scream 2 follows the Character Of Sydney once again as she has just gotten use to a normal life and settles in to society until Ghost face appears in a cinema showing Stab where hundreds of fans appear in ghost face masks which makes it a lot easier for the real ghost face to kill who ever he wants. After the murders in the cinema Sydney slowly realizes her life is in danger again and we are introduced to some familiar characters and a few new ones. Throughout the movie we are shown many kills and in my opinion they are not quite as good as they could have been as a third of the kills were off screen and all we could do is hear them, but that's not always a bad thing as one of the kills taken place in a van is very impactive even more so as it is a well loved character being killed. Over all the film has many jump scares, doesn't take itself to seriously and does an amazing job of giving the audience tension in my personal opinion anyway and also in my opinion Scream 2 manages to surpass even its original and many ways which is what I love in any sequel but don't get to often",Scream 2
424,mylucky444,Come on its not that bad,7,27 November 2005,Now we all know that its not as great as the classic first. But this movie is a lot better than most people say. In my opinion I thought that this movie had almost as many great scares and laughs as the first. At some points it drags on a little but for the most part it proves to be very entertaining. More great performances from Campbell and Kennedy. Like all the other slasher movies each sequel is a little harder to believe that another killer wants the same person dead for a whole other reason but once you get past that this movie will give you a great ride. Once again Wes Craven brings you a movie that full of thrills and laughs. In my opinion its definitely worth spending a few bucks on if you liked the first one.,Scream 2
425,screamfantheory,Arguably superior to the first film.,7,11 March 2017,"Scream 2. As much as you may love the original Scream, you may not enjoy Scream 2 nearly as much. Most fans consider the first superior; it has a 6.1 compared to Scream's 7.2 on IMDb, a 61% on Metacritic to Scream's 63%, and it rarely beats the original in both forums and rankings of the films. (To be fair, it does have 2% higher on Rotten Tomatoes, at 81%, to Scream's 79%.) After all it is a sequel, which deems it a dumping ground for many fans of the genre, including Randy.Randy's argument in Scream 2 is simple: sequels are often paint-by-the- numbers Hollywood cash grabs (looking at you, Friday the 13th Part 2), following the original verbatim, with no original screams or laughs. Scream 2 initially does follow the structure of the original. The victims of the second movie match those in the first movie to a limited extent, leading Gale to invent the copycat theory, which states that the killer is patterning himself after the original film.Williamson is, in the meta style beloved by fans of the franchise, stating that Scream 2 is, prior to his death, inferior to the original. After this point in the film the copycat theory falls apart, as Randy was obviously not killed in the original. Starting at this point, the film becomes far more exciting: all bets are off, as the death of the franchise's most beloved supporting character kicks off a whirlwind building to an epic chase in a theater which comprises roughly the second half of the film.One of the more often discussed points of Scream 2 is that Mickey's love for sequels foreshadows that he is the killer. Sidney believed Billy and Stu killed because they ""had seen one too many horror movies""; she may also have believed that Mickey simply took his love of sequels too far, leading him to join the serial killer network described by Mrs. Loomis near the end of the film and promptly join her on the murderous rampage which claimed the lives of eight innocent students. In effect, Mickey symbolizes support for the sequel in the horror genre, and when he kills Randy, who represents disdain for sequels (going so far as to claim they ruined the horror genre), Williamson sends a much-needed ""fuck you"" to those who, although fans of the first film, disregard the second.Furthermore, as sequels are often deemed unoriginal, enjoying them may imply that sequel lovers are themselves less original. In Scream 2, this is certainly true, as Mickey's motivations are hardly unique, both in that he agrees with the moral majority which believes horror movies create psychos and in that he fills in for Stu's role in the first film, in acting as the sidekick who is first to go. Williamson would be hard-pressed to cite an example of Mickey expanding meaningfully on the Scream mythos as he functions as a killer. In effect, Mickey himself also represents the convention of the horror sequel: a paint-by-the-numbers cash grab (as I described earlier). Thus, Mickey's death essentially represents the death of the unoriginal sequel; much as Scream hoped to end horror clichés such as ""I'll be right back"" and investigating a strange noise, Scream 2 hopes to end unoriginal sequels.I have heard criticisms that Mickey's character is too on-the-nose, in that he is a film director ranting about the psychological effects of horror films. However, this critique falls apart quickly when we compare it against the incredible reveal in Scream 1, in which Billy states the famous line, ""movies don't make psychos, Sid. Movies make psychos more creative"". The Scream franchise has never been particularly subtle, ranging from the thinly veiled allusions to Columbine in Scream 3, the aforementioned scenes in both the original and the sequel, and the rant about the increasingly contrived additions to the Stab franchise (time travel is a major plot point of Stab 5) which implies the pointlessness of any Scream film past Scream 3. And I have never heard any of those films criticized for their bluntness.Scream 2 understands the genre deeper than even the original film. Its first major point of analysis is its middle finger to detractors, its second the (naive) death of unoriginal genre sequels. However, there is another key insight.It occurs when Mrs. Loomis shoots Mickey. In order to understand why this death matters, we have to understand what Mrs. Loomis represents. Out of all seven killers within the movie franchise, nine counting the MTV television series, Mrs. Loomis is the only one not affiliated with the genre in some way or form. Billy and Stu are casual fans who took pointers from the genre. Billy mentions The Exorcist, and Stu mentions watching a few horror movies, likely slashers such as Halloween, Friday the 13th, and A Nightmare on Elm Street- and taking notes. Mickey is a film student, obsessed with proving that sequels can be better than the original. Roman is a film director who abandons his in-movie movie Stab 3 for the real movie Scream 3 and set in motion the events of the first film, after creating a ""family film"" documenting the affair between Maureen Prescott and Hank Loomis, Billy's father. Jill enjoys watching Shaun of the Dead with Kirby. Charlie flirts with Kirby about minute details of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, films everything, and asks his classmates randomly what their favorite scary movie is, awkwardly Ghostface without Piper is familiar with horror tropes, as we learn in her reveal in which she rants about the sexist assumption that the killer had to be the son of Brandon James, and finally, Kieran does not seem to be aware of the genre, but he is a bit of an exception already, having been the only Ghostface to be killed by another Ghostface and be part of 2 separate killing sprees.",Scream 2
