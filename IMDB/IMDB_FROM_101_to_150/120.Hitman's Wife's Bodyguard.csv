0,SnoopyStyle,Salma takes center stage,6,10 July 2021,"Bodyguard Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) is haunted from losing a client to hitman Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson). He lost his credentials in the aftermath. He's taking a sabbatical from violence and guns. He's kidnapped by Darius' wife Sonia (Salma Hayek) to join her in rescuing Darius. Then the trio gets kidnapped by Interpol to stop supervillain Aristotle Papdopolous (Antonio Banderas).The first movie is a mess but I like the actors' chemistry. I especially like Salma Hayek's scene stealing turns. I thought that the movie needed to make the duo into a trio. In this sequel, that's exactly what happens. Salma Hayek becomes a central lead. She's as crazy as ever. I like her craziness coupled with Ryan Reynolds. The story remains a mess. Quite frankly, the plot doesn't really matter. It is frenetic to the point of chaotic. Nobody should care about the diamond drill. I just enjoy some of the moments with the three leads together. Everything else around them is a blur and there are great actors being wasted as supporting characters. What the franchise needs at this point is competent writing and a director willing to let these three actors cook for long stretches. It doesn't need a heavy hand at the wheel pushing the plot.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
1,boblipton,Better Than Its Predecessor,6,26 June 2021,"2017's THE HITMAN'S BODYGUARD had Ryan Reynolds as a bodyguard tasked with guarding hitman Samuel L. Jackson until he could testify at the Hague. I wasn't very pleased with it, although the combination of Samuel L. Jackson's profanity, Reynolds' buttoned-down character, and a large body count seems to have pleased the box office. Perhaps it was the fallout from DEADPOOL In any case, they made a sequel, and I just looked at THE HITMAN'S WIFE'S BODYGUARD.Antonio Banderas is a Greek kazillionaire who has a plot to destroy Europe, leaving Greece the center of civilization. Jackson gets in his wy, gets kidnapped, and his bride, con woman Salma Hayek, gets Reynolds to help her rescue him. Eventually, this gathers the attention of Interpol, and Frank Grillo, who wants to get back to Boston, ropes the three of them in.It's far more competent than its predecessor, and Miss Hayek's manic performance is a treat, as is the handsome location shooting of Terry Stacey. Jackson is slightly more contained, Reynolds is slightly more repressed, there's Morgan Freeman as Reynolds' father, and one very good gag about Bondian supervillains' ridiculous schemes. Stick to the sharks with lasers, guys!",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
2,Prismark10,Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard,4,4 July 2021,The main plot of Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard dates from the global financial crisis of 2008. Since then there has been another kind of global crisis altogether.Greek supervillain Aristotle Papadopoulos (Antonio Banderas) is so vexed that poor Greece is being financially punished by the European Union. He plans to use a super drill on an underwater junction box that holds the data for the European Union's computers and install a super virus.Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) is the former triple-A rated bodyguard who has lost his bodyguard licence. He is haunted by his association with the notorious assassin Darius Kincaid (Samuel L Jackson) and is in therapy.While taking a break abroad. Bryce is dragged back into action by Kincaid's wacky wife Sonia (Salma Hayek.) Before long all three are recruited by Interpol to stop Aristotle's' dastardly daft plan.The movie is a cartoonish action film. At least it has some mindless fun. Bryce has the recuperative powers of Deadpool given the punishment he takes in this movie including being run over at high speed.The plot makes no sense. Constant swearing is meant to be witty. The best part is the wordplay between Reynolds and Jackson when Bryce introduces his father.Hayek is hysterical. Banderas plays Aristotle like he came to Greece via Spain.,Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
3,nogodnomasters,Driving without a seatbelt,7,30 June 2021,"There is zero character introduction. The script assumes you know the characters from the first feature. Ryan Reynolds teams up with Samuel L. Jackson, Salma Hayek, and Frank Grillo to save all of Europe from a cyber attack from Greek Millionaire Antonio Banderas. (If Sean Connery can play a Russian in a serious film. . .)There are lost of shootings, car chases, and laughs. Not as good as the first one.Guide: F-word. No nudity. Distant clothed sex scene.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
4,kosmasp,Say hello to my little filos,9,11 August 2021,"If you know your greek you will recognize this tweaked version of a Scarface quote (the 80s Scarface that is in case you have a very well versed film knowledge). Another thing to know: the film features a lot of foul language and a lot of violence. Is there a big story behind it? No this is more about shooting cool stuff, explosions and quotes to take home.As a Greek I sort of almost wanted the villain to succeed. Of course not really because after all he is bad and evil, right? But it was nice to see a Greek bad guy for once - and very well established and sawn into the financial crisis and into general history. And while it is not an actual Greek playing that role (Papadopoulos or Papad..less as he is also called by Sam Jacksons character at one point), Antonio Banderas is not only a great actor who is great, he also learned or knew some Greek words he threw in there for good measure. Always a nice thing to hear that and while it may only be a minor detail, it is something that is much appreciated.Also his history with Salma Hayek makes this almost meta. Not to mention a ""cameo"" that I wasn't aware of, that has a funny scene with Samuel L. Jacksons character ... his voice may be one of the most recognizable ones ever.So this is case of style over substance ... but in a very good way.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
5,paul_haakonsen,Essentially it went as most sequels tend to go...,5,25 August 2021,"I did thoroughly enjoy the 2017 movie ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"", so when I saw that there was a sequel coming out and seeing that they vastly improved on the cast, I must admit that I was thrilled to get to sit down and watch the 2021 movie ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"".However, while ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" certainly was watchable and entertaining enough, it just didn't have the punch and the comedy that the 2017 movie offered. And it was a bit disappointing actually. And oddly so since they really upped the game with the likes of Morgan Freeman, Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas added to the cast list.The storyline told in this 2021 sequel was just a bit too mundane in comparison to the first movie. Sure, the movie was fun and entertaining enough for what it was. Just a shame that it never managed to get up to the same level as the 2017 movie ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" did.Of course it is fun to see Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson back on the screen together. And I do admit that having Salma Hayek as part of the main cast was definitely fun, especially with her particular character and that accent.There is a good amount of action in the movie, though it does feel a bit wasted given the movie's otherwise mundane storyline.I must say, though, that ""Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" wasn't as entertaining as I had hoped. But it is adequate enough for a single viewing if you're in for an evening of some light-hearted action comedy.And I do find it a shame that writers Phillip Murphy and Brandon Murphy didn't manage to take this 2021 movie up to the same level as its predecessor.My rating of director Patrick Hughes' 2021 movie lands on a mediocre five out of ten stars.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
6,BandSAboutMovies,Dumb fun,6,21 August 2021,"Bodyguard Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) and hit man Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) are back back together. Still unlicensed, Bryce is forced ito come back into the killer's orbit by Darius' wife, con artist Sonia Kincaid (Salma Hayek). Now, they have to save Europe from a killer virus and the plan to make Greece great again from Aristotle Papdopolous (Antonio Banderas). And just who might Morgan Freeman be?This film is a sequel to the 2017 film The Hitman's Bodyguard and features Reynolds, Jackson, Hayek and Richard E. Grant reprising their roles, with Frank Grillo (alwats welcome in more films!), Tom Hopper, Banderas and Freeman joining the guns and comedy party. Around 150 of the crew came back to work on this sequel as well.Incredibly, while Jackson met Freeman when both were struggling stage actors in New York, this is the first feature film they've ever appeared in together!The story really isn't as important as the fact that this movie is filled with action setpieces. I'd never seen the original, but was instantly taken in by this fun film. It's mindless explosions and stunt-filled mayhem, but after the end of a long week of work, isn't that what you want sometimes?",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
7,CinemaSerf,Unnecessary sequel that just about holds it's own...,6,14 September 2021,"OK, so it won't be troubling any awards jurors anytime soon, but as a fun - throwaway - vehicle for Ryan Reynolds, of whom it has to be said usually excels in the production of such films, this is just an harmless piece of much needed escapism that allows a decent cast including Samuel L. Jackson as arch-nemesis ""Kincaid"" with his feisty sidekick wife ""Sonia"" (Salma Hayek) and an awkwardly cast Antonio Banderas as ""Aristotle Papadopolous) to demonstrate that fun can be had whilst travelling around Europe making a movie. Sure, it's nowhere near as good as the first one, but after the 2020 most of us had, this is an unashamedly uplifting series of set-piece scenarios that see plenty of shoot 'em ups and far fetched stunts that essentially allow the star to get shot at, wet, locked in a car boot and generally taken advantage of (no, sadly not THAT kind of advantage). It delivers what it says on the tin, it's not a piece of deep and meaningful cinema, indeed once you've seen it you will probably put the kettle on and forget all about it - but there is a place for this kind of disposable stuff, and Reynolds et al deliver well enough here to raise the odd smile and cheer a man up for an entirely unchallenging 100 minutes.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
8,zardoz-13,A Sequel That Tops Its Predecessor,10,18 September 2021,"As the sequel to 2017's ""The Hitman's Bodyguard,"" ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" is far funnier and even more satirical than its hyperactive predecessor. Actress Elodie Yung is the only cast member who doesn't reprise her role as Michael Bryce's girlfriend Interpol Agent Amelia Roussel. Scenarists Tom O'Connor and Philip & Brandon Murphy make no mention of Agent Roussel's absence in their screenplay. Nevertheless, supporting characters in the original film encore in cameos, including Richard E. Grant as the paranoid accountant Seifert who sought Bryce's services after the disastrous airport debacle involving an infamous Asian executive Kurosawa (Tsuwayuki Saotome). Moreover, we learn about the circumstances surrounding Darius Kincaid's incredible shot that put Kurosawa in a coffin. A similar group of nuns that accompanied Michael and Darius on the bus in the original appear on ferry with Michael and Sonia. Salma Hayek's role has been considerably expanded. She takes front and center rather than loiters on the periphery. The latest cast addition is Morgan Freeman. Not only does he play Michael's adopted father, but he also is a bodyguard himself, who has amassed more accolades than Michael. We learn about Michael's aversion to Gelato ice cream. Tough guy actor Frank Grillo is cast as an abrasive Boston detective inexplicably reassigned to Interpol who strongarms Michael and Darius into their latest escapade. ""Expendables 3"" director Patrick Hughes, who directed ""The Hitman's Bodyguard,"" is back at the helm, and he has conjured up some spectacular stunts for our heroes to survive as they contend with a madcap Greek villain, played with suave aplomb by Spanish actor Antonio Banderas. Like the original film, ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" takes place primarily in Europe as well as on the Mediterranean, though it was filmed largely in Croatia.""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" opens with our grieving hero Michael Bryce still reeling from the loss of his Triple-A-Bodyguard license because Darius killed his most important client. We find Michael flat on a couch in a psychiatrist's office as the action unfolds. The psychiatrist (Rebecca Front of ""Marionette"") suggests Michael stash his guns and enjoy a nice vacation on the picturesque limestone island of Capri in southern Italy and maintain a daily journal about his recovery. Meantime, Bryce is still obsessed with facing a tribunal so he can get his Triple-A-Bodyguard rated license back. His shrink compromises with Michael and allows him to keep his penknife as long as he dispenses with his firearms. Meantime, the nation of Greece faces stiff sanctions from the European Union as the country's economy spirals into a freefall. EU Chairman Walter Fiscer plans to impose them in four days. The chief villain in ""Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" is Aristotle Papdopolous (Antonio Banderas of ""The Mask of Zorro""), and he threatens to burn all of Europe's infrastructure if Fiscer refuses to reverse the democratic vote that brought about the issue. Aristotle swells his chest with oratory and proclaims, ""Financial markets will collapse, and millions of lives will be lost while Greece will return to her rightful place at the center of civilization!"" The last we see of Fiscer is as Aristotle's henchmen slip a plastic bag over his head to suffocate him.Meantime, on sunny Capri, Michael Bryce is actually trying to recuperate. Sprawled on a beach cot, he tries to imagine life without bodyguarding, guns, and blood as he reads a book and listens to serene music. Little does he realize that dozens of armed killers have swarmed into the area and are shooting it up while he indulges in his reverie. Michael's dream vacation ends abruptly when a bosomy babe, Sonia Kincaid (Salma Hayek of ""Bandidas""), rips off his head phones, and our hero realizes he is under fire in a battlefield. ""The mafia took my husband,"" screams Sonia! ""We have got to go get him!"" Little does Michael know that Sonia visited his shrink and tortured her about his whereabouts. Sonia explains that Darius insisted on Michael by name. Little does either know Sonia misunderstood Darius. Instead, Darius asked for anybody but Michael Bryce! Sonia shoots their way out of Capri, straddles a motor scooter with Bryce riding tandem, and the killers pursue them in a bullet-riddled chase. Ultimately, Sonia and Michael wind up plunging from a towering cliff into the sea to surface in an underwater grotto. Remember the surprise in the end credits of ""The Hitman's Bodyguard?"" Darius did enough time in Bellmarsh Prison to secure Sonia's release and then he broke out! Now, they were on their honeymoon when Darius mysteriously disappeared. Sonia stuns Michael when she announces Darius and she plan to have a baby. ""My God have mercy on our souls,"" moans Michael. Not surprisingly, Darius isn't pleased when Michael and Sonia rescue him from the mafia and Sonia realizes her goof.Meantime, Aristotle plots his EU reprisal. During a secret rendezvous with Europe's most notorious cyber hacker, Gunther Van Weber (Blake Ritson of ""RocknRolla""), Aristotle learns how to penetrate tungsten carbide data junction boxes with a diamond drill. Thousands of these boxes in classified locations are scattered across Europe. After drilling into a data box in Zagreb, Croatia, Gunther uploads his lethal virus and weaponizes everything connected to it. A high velocity power surge fries the power grid, and the toll starts out with 75 dead. Aristotle's henchmen murder Gunther, steal his virus, and set out to destroy the rest. Interpol Agent Bobby O'Neill (Frank Grillo of ""Beyond Skyline"") learns from his mafia contact, Carlo (Miltos Yerolemou of ""The Danish Girl""), about the next attack, but this colossal comedy of errors takes an even funnier turn when O'Neill clashes with Michael, Sonia, and Darius after they have iced Carlo. O'Neill coerces them into doing what Interpol cannot.This synopsis covers only the first 20 minutes of the 100 in ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard."" You can only imagine the insane hilarity and big surprises left in its remaining 80 minutes.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
9,neil-476,A hoot,8,24 June 2021,"In 2017 we saw The Hitman's Bodyguard in which personal security operative Michael Bryce finds his fortunes inextricably entwined with those of professional assassin Darius Kincaid (Samuel L Jackson) and his wife Sonia (Salma Hayek). The unexpected success of the movie leads to this sequel in which Bryce, trying to shed the unhappy personal and professional consequences of the previous film, finds himself thrust once more into the problematic lives of the Kinkaids.There is some story here to keep you interested: it's not totally predictable,mand Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman are thrown in to liven things up.But this trades on what made its predecessor successful - an amusing script, loads of action, wall-to-wall profanity, gory but often slapstick violence, and effective chemistry between the three principal actors.In fact, the entire cast seem to be having a blast, and this comes over. Salma Hayek, in particular, is a hoot, with several good boob and age jokes, and a couple of bursts of hilarious obscenity-laden invective.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
10,morrison-dylan-fan,The Wife's Hitman Bodyguard.,7,22 June 2021,"Going with friends for a weekend in Milton Keynes,we originally planned to see Nobody (2021) until the Cineworld in Milton Keynes was charging double the price for this ""peak hours"" showing (£14 a ticket) then the one local two us was (at £7!) Looking at the second option,we randomly picked a film playing at the Odeon, got the tickets for £8 each,and prepared to meet the bodyguard.View on the film:Taking on the hitman and the bodyguard, Salma Hayek gives a mesmerising performance as Sonia, whose tongue-twisting one-liners are delivered by Hayek with a real relish,which is matched with an infectious enthusiasm as Hayek dives into the high-kicking action set-pieces.Shaken by their last encounter, Ryan Reynolds gives a very funny turn as Bryce, who Reynolds locks into panic mode, bouncing from a reunion with trigger-happy assassins,to terrified at running into world dominating baddies, whilst Samuel (yel) L. Jackson unleashes hilarious one-liners with an ice cool scream.Directing for the first time since the original movie in 2017, director Patrick Hughes & cinematographer Terry Stacey criss-cross a globe-trotting Spy Adventure atmosphere of glossy panning shots following the trio down the dressed to the nines streets of Italy, with cracking Action Comedy set-pieces,exploding from whip-pans landing on Bryce finding himself stuck in a shoot-out,to one-liners being fired between the trio,whilst driving in a thrilling car chase sequence.Using elements of the first film as a basic set-up,returning writer Tom O'Connor is here joined by Brandon Murphy & Phillip Murphy for a bubbly Action Comedy screenplay,which loads up fish out of water buddy Comedy zingers for Bryce to be hit with,with neat twists revealing the family behind the hitman's wife's bodyguard.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

13,tabuno,An Above Average If Not Breakthrough Action Comedy,7,24 June 2021,"Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, and Salma Hayek reprise their characters in this sequel to the action comedy The Hitman's Bodyguard (2017). In a rather more convoluted plot that adds Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman to the list of characters, this sequel does not really break any new ground, but does pull together the elements of action comedy in a bit splashier way and incorporates a decent dose of emotional backstories and somewhat more personal intimate scenes that add a nice balance to the action comedy. The threat to the European Union is quite a nice new spin on mass destruction. There are a few places where the movie threatened to become an unintended parody but pulled itself out with experienced acting. Overall, this movie is an enjoyable summer movie that offers a little mental attention to follow the plot and the relaxed luxury to join in the visual and auditory physical action, the light-heartedness, a few poignant moments and come out satisfied if not ""exuberantly"" and ""amazed.""",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
14,The-Sarkologist,Zany and Over the Top,8,19 June 2021,"I seem to be going on a bit of a Ryan Reynolds bender here because this is the third Reynolds film that I have watched in a week. Maybe I should cap it off with Deadpool since I've been doing a bit of that. Anyway, I ended up going and seeing this because the first one was pretty good. You could say that it was one of those old school over the top action films, and that is seriously something that has been missing of late. Well, all I can say is that this film certainly didn't disappoint. In fact the entire cinema was cracking up in laughter (all five other people mind you - thanks CoVid).This is basically the sequel to The Hitman's Bodyguard, and as I have suggested, it is pretty much as zany as the first, except that they decide to have Darius' Kinkaid's wife play a much bigger role, and once again they don't disappoint. Like a lot of these films they have this nasty bad guy that is planning on destroying the world, or at least destroying Europe, and all there happens to be is a group of misfits - a hitman, a con-artist, and a bodyguard - as they keep on reminding us, that stand in the way to total destruction.Like, as I mentioned, this film was hilarious, especially when you find out why Sonia Kinkaid is caught up in a gunfight when she is first introduced, and she doesn't let go for the rest of the film. In fact, Reynolds, Hayek, and Jackson all just seem to bounce off of each other perfectly, and I guess that is one of the reasons that this is such a great film. Sure, it isn't original, and it certainly won't be winning any awards, but it is one of those films that is such a great ride.Mind you, once again the French have outdone themselves with the title, because it happens to be 'Le Femme de Mon Meilleur Ennemi', which basically translates to 'My Best Enemy's Wife'. Yeah, they do seem to be able to come up with much better titles than the English version, but I guess that's the way it goes.Still, if you like action, and you like a lot of laughs, I definitely recommend giving this film a go.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

Jackson he's in his 70's or close to it. I love how Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) character handles everything the events so well especially in a hilarious way even during the chaos. The same impressive aspect with Samuel it's impressive how Morgan Freeman does everything at his age mid 80's.

He now has to save the famous assassin with the help of his wife.Since I had already watched the first movie I already knew what to expect from this one. It was funny and it was combined with plenty of action scenes that made it even more interesting than what it already was. For one more time the interpretations of Ryan Reynolds who played as Michael Bryce, Samuel L. Jackson who played as Darius Kincaid and Salma Hayek who played as Sonia Kincaid were very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Antonio Banderas' who played as Aristotle Papdopolous and Morgan Freeman's who played as Senior.

17,cruise01,"Action packed, fun, and entertaining sequel.",8,18 June 2021,"4 out of 5 stars.Hitmans Wifes Bodyguard is a good action comedy film that may have less laughs than the first movie. But still fun and action packed that makes it an entertaining summer blockbuster film.What worked? The film is very fast moving. So fast moving that it skips out any story development like an introduction to Antonio Banderas villain character. And his agenda of causing destruction. Then, having Ryan Reynolds Michael Bryce character going on symbatical to help face against his conflict with losing his bodyguard license. Salma Hayeks character showing up with bad guys in every scene. Chasing them and leading them into shoot outs. While she wants to save her husband Samuel L. Jackson. Next thing you know they are chasing a device that the bad guy wants.It is action packed. Lots of shoot outs. Car chases. And fighting to make it entertaining. The film tries to be bigger than the first. With lots going on with plot. It even has an interpol agent played by Frank Grillo who was very much underused in the film.It may not have much laughs or humor than the first. The script may be lacking the humor. But still a lot of fun with the cast ensemble. Seeing Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, and Salma Hayek nitpick at each other throughout. About family, relationships, and there past trauma. Antonio Banderas does play a good villain. Even with his henchmen who are similiar to the three characters.What did not work? The films plot may be forgettable. Even some side characters like Morgan Freeman making an appearance. And Frank Grillo.Overall, it was a fun film with lots of action but forgettable story.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
18,Floated2,Falls short of the original,3,5 July 2021,"Having not completely enjoyed the original but there was a much lite fluid approach and entertaining factor along with subtle humor. This sequel, things are far more over the top, repetitive and the plot is predictable and at times confusing. It isn't nearly as fun as the original.

19,eddie_baggins,More of the same with Hayek stealing the show,5,30 June 2021,"If there was ever a film that really didn't need a sequel it was 2017's The Hitman's Bodyguard but thanks to a worldwide box office gross that was well in excess of $150 million dollars and some public sentiment that ensured it found a willing audience upon arrival on home video services, Australia director Patrick Hughes and his two leading men find themselves back doing what they do best in a generic sequel providing very much of the same in this covid delayed sequel The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard.Overcoming what is surely one of 2021's worst titles, Bodyguard gets to coast off the sleepwalking Ryan Reynolds as bodyguard neurotic Michael Bryce and the constantly yelling (swearing) Samuel L. Jackson as bloodthirsty hitman Darius Kincaid with the two performers barely raising a sweat creating a charismatic bickering duo that is enlivened by the increased screen time of Kincaid's wife Sonia who gets to be bought to life by a having a blast Salma Hayek whose having as much fun as she's had in years with this role.Full of sass, crazy eyes and eye catching outfits, Hayek is the main reason why Bodyguard doesn't feel like more of a slog, as the film around her is unable to give Reynolds and Jackson the same great moments scattered throughout that the first film managed to do while Hughes bloody action set pieces pile up also without managing to bring much in the way of goodness to this outing that see's the unlikely trio taking on Antonio Banderas's definitely not Greek villain Aristotle Papdopolous from being a very naughty boy and taking down power grids across the European lands.You certainly never watch a film of this ilk for the story, with this sequel even more so than the first feeling like a genuine old-school adult orientated Hollywood action comedy that use to be frequently found in cinemas across the 80's and early 90's (think The Last Boy Scout, 48 Hrs etc) and the story is almost like an afterthought that merely exists to allow Hayek and Jackson a chance to make innuendo laden jokes about their love life/want for children or for Reynolds to fall victim to another moment of bodily carnage that most surely should've sent him to an emergency ward.Despite these narrative hiccups and a pedestrian approach to most of its material that will fail to surprise but will likely induce a few hearty chuckles and well delivered smiles, Bodyguard is far from the worst Hollywood comedy to come along our way over recent times and considering the genre is now mostly dormant with streaming offerings and TV shows carrying on the baton, its nice to be able to watch a genuine genre offering that could've done more with its all-star cast but gets by regardless with the bare minimum effort.Final Say -Very much more of the same following on from the first film, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard does nothing new these four years on from the first outing bar including a scene-stealing Salma Hayek in a far bigger role as it gets by with some killer gags and a lot of unneeded filler.2 1/2 seat-belts out of 5.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

24,stevendbeard,Great Chemistry,8,13 June 2021,"I saw ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"", starring Ryan Reynolds-the Deadpool movies, Green Lantern; Samuel L. Jackson-Spiral, The Spirit; Salma Hayek-Like a Boss, Everly; Morgan Freeman-London Has Fallen, Wanted and Antonio Banderas-Dolittle, The Expendables 3.This is a sequel to the 2017 'Hitman's Bodyguard' with Samuel returning as the hitman, Ryan as the bodyguard and Salma as the con artist/wife to Samuel. The producers gave Salma a bigger role here than she had in the first movie-which is fine by me-mostly concerning her desire to have a baby, while killing bad guys. Ryan has been spiraling due to events from the first movie-involving Samuel-and has had to seek psychiatric help. Ryan is basically told to take a vacation-no bodyguarding, no guns-but that doesn't last long, when Salma comes to him seeking help with a problem. It seems Samuel was kidnapped and they need his help. The usual gun fights, car chases, etc. Ensue with lots of things exploding-my kind of movie-and all 3 of the leads have great chemistry together. Especially, Ryan & Samuel. Antonio plays the bad guy with a plot to destroy Europe and Morgan plays....well, it's better if you don't know beforehand. Lets just say, Morgan has a personal history with one of the main 3 leads. There is a scene just as the end credits start-which could point to another sequel-and at the very end is a funny dedication to 2 actors, Gary & Johann.It's rated ""R"" for bloody violence, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.I would definitely buy this on Blu_Ray.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

27,alindsay-al,An Average Action Sequel,5,1 July 2021,"I enjoyed The Hitman's Bodyguard so was excited for its sequel here and I watched it today and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees Michael Bryce bought out of sabbatical to work with the hitman he has a vendetta against and his wife.Main Character
Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson are back in the two lead roles and there is no denying that they have strong and enjoyable chemistry together. There characters are in different points then they were in the previous film and they play it up well enough. The two of them aren't as entertaining as they were in the previous film but they they do just about enough to keep the energy alive.Supporting Characters
Really the only supporting character worth anything for me is Morgan Freeman and that is mainly because of how entertaining it is to see Freeman on screen in a film like this, he doesn't play a large role but it is an enjoyable one for sure. Salma Hayek has a much larger role in this film and she annoyed me here, she is just a shrieking violet for the majority of the film, she worked in the previous film because her role was small but she is just way too much here and it made this film worse then the previous film. Antonio Banderas plays the bad guy and similar to Gary Oldman in the previous film he is just as generic and dull as they come. He is so cliché and literally anybody could have played this role with this being another really week element of the film. Frank Grillo plays an FBI agent and his role is completely pointless, he sleepwalks through the film and his role seems majorly unnecessary and just there to pad out the runtime.Story
The story isn't exactly the part of the film that is focused on but it is really poor here, the film attempts to put some depth into the characters but it just doesn't work. Every twist is expected and the film doesn't even try to be inventive, the focus on Salma Hayek's character is annoying and it just doesn't work for this film and the dull villain and poor storytelling does very little for me with a pretty stupid ending.Script
The script has some moments, the humour occasionally hits and had me laughing or at least chuckling which is better then nothing. But some of the humour and pretty much all of the drama falls short and lowers the quality of the overall film.Style
The film has some really decent action scenes, they are brutal but enjoyable and you see all types of action scenes that keeps the film moving pretty well. But the film feels longer then it actually is, I did see myself checking my watch and maybe it is an overuse of action or maybe plot elements that do not need to be in the film.Overall
Overall, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard is an average action film. If you loved the first film then you will probably at least like this one, but I liked the first film and did not really like this one and I am not sure it is worth the time to watch it.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

29,smatysia,A rollicking good time,8,15 October 2021,"This movie appears to be a sequel to a previous film that I have not seen, and was not aware of. It seems to partly be a parody (or homage) to James Bond movies, with its beautiful, exotic locations, and its gigantic fiendish plot with innumerable armed henchmen. The violence is off the charts, although somewhat cartoonish, and the body count is astronomical. The frequent(!) bad language is yet another of the little jokes in the subtext. While one expects this from Samuel L. Jackson, the real treasure of the film was the character of Salma Hayek, who, while lovely and charming, was more than a little crazy, and her continuous and fairly inventive streams of profane invective. Made me chuckle almost every time. I liked this movie way more than I thought I would.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
30,kirbylee70-599-526179,SOPHOMORE EFFORT,6,31 August 2021,"A hit movie these days guarantees one thing that it will be followed by a sequel or if they can keep being hits a franchise of films. In some cases like JOHN WICK this is a good thing where those involved attempt to not just repeat the success of the first film but make the next chapter just as good. Unfortunately most movies that have sequels suffer from a sophomore slump and THE HITMAN'S WIFE'S BODYGUARD falls loosely into that category.The first film was a bromance between top professional bodyguard Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) and hitman Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson). Kincaid was turning states evidence to The Hague against Vladislav Dukhovic (Gary Oldman) in return for the release of his wife Sonia (Salma Hayek). By the end of that film Bryce was back to his old self, Sonia was released, Kincaid escaped and they were reunited.This film kicks off two years later. Bryce is having issues still with what happened back then. He's filled with self-doubt and the triple A review board is about to decide whether to renew his license as a bodyguard or not. Seeing a therapist she tells him he needs time away from the guns and violence and sends him on a vacation to Capri.Relaxing on the beach wearing headphones he's unaware of the carnage around him until Sonia yanks off his headphones and pulls him to cover. She's tracked him down and needs his help. Darius has been kidnapped and specifically asked her to get Bryce to save him. As the bullets fly all around them the make their escape. They save Darius who tells Sonia what he said was anyone BUT Bryce. As they leave they are captured by Interpol agents.Agent Bobby O'Neill (Frank Grillo) needs their help. Wealthy madman Aristotle Papadopoulos (Antonio Banderas) wants to destroy the European power grid because the European Union has placed demands on his country of Greece. His plan is to crush the European monetary system and create chaos. O'Neill sends in Bryce and Sonia as the buyers for the plans revealing the location of the grid hubs with the standard madness that follows in the wake of any and all Kincaids.With the secrets locked in a steel case and a bomb watch attached to Sonia's arm they go to the only place Bryce thinks he can find help, his father (Morgan Freeman). But Papadopoulos is not so easily put off and his men capture the trio. More twists and turns follow and double crosses take place and eventually it will take Bryce and Darius uniting as a team to set things straight, including rescuing Sonia from the clutches of Papadopoulos.The movie is filled with plenty of gunplay, explosions and action just like the first film was. And Ryan Reynolds once more is hit by so many vehicles you wonder how he could still stand (because it's a movie in case you didn't know). The mayhem that follows this pair is major and the body counts high. And for some reason not a single policeman is in sight anywhere.The problems start with Ryan's character. At the end of the first film he seemed to be back in control of his life. It looked like everything was finally falling into place, he got the girl, he got his job back and all was well. But as this film opens it's as if all of that never took place. Instead he is a wreck, worse off than he was at the start of the first film. To make matters worse it takes him most of this film to get back on track again.The next problem is with Hayek. She is one incredible actress when given the chance to do so. But here she tends to rave, rant and scream more than anything. I'm sure it was a choice made to give her something lighter than what she's done in the past but it becomes grating after a short time. Jackson plays it as smooth as always and yes, he drops the MF bomb repeatedly here. Fans of that will be pleased while others will tire of it. Banderas reeks of evil here and does a solid job.In the end the movie is entertaining enough but not one I'd watch a second time nor add to my collection. Is it worth a night's rental? For fans of the first film and the actors involved probably. But if they decide to make this a trilogy I hope they work a little more on the script. With the time they had they should have done that here.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

32,aidanratesmovies,"Not as bad as some say, but still not great concidering the talent involved",6,4 July 2021,"A weak story and scriptural problems aside, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard is a mostly fun and rather funny little action comedy that fully dedicates itself to what it wants to be- even if it doesn't quite know what that is. Most of the cons of this movie come from the script and story at hand. Not only does it feel rather familiar, and formulaic, but it clearly has no idea where it wants to go, and just seems to let the film run on autopilot until they find a way to get it's characters to a plotpoint. Some moments can also just be a bit melodramatic, and take you out of the entertaining experience and vibe of the film. Salma Hayek also overacts quite a bit in a lot of her scenes, and her role seems stretched out to lengths it was never really prepared for. All that aside, I did find this movie to be rather entertaining. The action scenes were well choreographed- especially towards the end, and Jackson and Renyolds truly give the film their all despite the films rather angry tone. I laughed quote a bit throughout, not every joke works, but surprisingly most of them do, and I had fun in the end enjoying this dumb little action comedy. Some smaller pros are the cinematography, excellent, and the soundtrack which varies from a bunch of classic tunes that I feel fits the vibe they were going for. In the end, The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard is far from perfect, but it sucrefs at what it wants to do, even with it's unclear direction.My Rating: 5.7/10.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
33,AudioFileZ,Dissappointing Second Installment,4,7 July 2021,"If this is to be an on-going franchise I'd say this second installment doesn't make a strong case for it. I remember liking the first one (it's a little fuzzy as to how much) , but this one did not make a very good impression from the start It felt weak and clumsy right away. The initial scooter chase for instance was poor. However we have the triple threat of Selma, Ryan, and Samuel and a big budget. Oh, and Morgan Freeman with Antonio Banderas.As the movie progresses I'd say it's not a great script at all. It uses a lot of violent shoot-outs to carry the water. Not really a substitute for a good story. As we get about half-way through there is an attempt at some acting, but again the story is just goofy over clever.

But I was pleasantly surprised here!After recently losing his bodyguard licence, Michael Bryce is forced into action by Sonia Kincaid to recover her husband Darius Kincaid. The trio are assigned to take down a villain hell bent on causing complete mayhem across Europe!I found the film to be quite enjoyable! It's 1 hour & 33 minutes of action, shoots/explosions, laughs & eye candy, Salma Hayek especially was smoking in this film! The film wasn't as bad as I thought it was going be, I was expecting it to be w0ke & although it did appear like that in the trailer & the first 5 minutes in the film, the rest of the film sees the trio leads doing all the fighting, shooting driving & mayhem!The villain however, was weak to non existent! Like himself, his motives weren't touched & heavily focused upon as much which made the plot feel somewhat empty & not taken seriously, that's not to say the comedy was bad, but I felt there could've been an equal balance!Overall it's a solid comedy with a basic plot! Don't expect too much with this one! It's a fun action packed thrill ride not to be taken seriously!

38,Abdulxoxo,Just as enjoyable and amusing as the first one,8,21 July 2021,"Bodyguard Michael Bryce is taking a sabbatical; but gets drawn back into the game by Sonia, the wife of Bryce's frenemy from the first film, assassin Darius Kincaid.Firstly the plot, it's so ridiculous. There's so much going on and very little of it is for any good reason to be happening other than to set up the next chase, fight or gag. But I'm pretty sure nobody liked the first movie because of its 'coherent plot'. The best way to enjoy this movie is to go in knowing the plot is preposterous. The characters were just as diabolical as they were in original movie. Reynolds and Jackson played off of each other nicely and were really funny. Their chemistry is what held the first movie together and is no different in this sequel. And top of that is Salma Hayek, she was really good in her few scenes in this first film and luckily she has a bigger role here. She is just as foul-mouthed and every bit as dangerous as her husband Kincaid. Salma Hayek was very enjoyable and she nailed the role. Antonio Banderas was having fun as the villain, Aristotle Papadopoulos. There's also a larger cameo (arguably supporting role) which is bizarre, but actually quite funny. Another thing to enjoy apart from the performances, is the grand scale action sequences. There were all sorts of sequences including boats, cars, bikes, you name it. They were very entertaining and managed to maintain the right balance of humour and violence during these scenes. There were even some repeated gags from the first film which I enjoyed a lot. The soundtrack was good, keeping the energy up throughout the movie. The cinematography was slick as well. However some of the action suffered from poor editing. It keeps cutting frantically.On the whole, there's so much to enjoy about this film; the good cast performance, entertaining action scenes, and lots of funny moments. This film didn't sit well with the critics but as a fan of the original, this sequel is as every good and amusing as its predecessor.

39,arungeorge13,The kind of sequel that exists because the original made money! [+44%],4,3 July 2021,"No one really expects a solid plot from a film that's titled Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard, but what we do anticipate is a series of running gags coupled with silly-but-fun action set-pieces. The film - starring Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L Jackson, Salma Hayek, Morgan Freeman, Antonio Banderas, and Frank Grillo - is the sequel (to The Hitman's Bodyguard) nobody asked for but also the kind Hollywood frequently keeps gifting us. To sum it up, it is cut from the same cloth as its predecessor. We have a save-the-continent plot that involves flushing out a device from the baddies' clutches. This time around, Sonia Kincaid, (Hayek) the wife of Darius Kincaid (Jackson), carries more weight in the screenplay. Her presence, while always refreshing, adds little in the form of humour. It takes two to tango, but three is a tangle, they say.Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard revels in its pop-culture references (that ranges from 1987's Overboard to an Ace of Base song to a whole story around Italian gelato). Some of the self-referencing manages to raise a chuckle or two, though that's not nearly enough to see it all the way through. Director Patrick Hughes also completely wastes the services of Morgan Freeman and Antonio Banderas - both characters confusingly written and portrayed. The sequel won't win over any new fans, but it may mildly satisfy whoever enjoyed the original's wackiness.

It feels like I may have missed something.Final Verdict: I really enjoyed the prequel. The sequel was not original. The foul factor that came from hitman along with his shown relationship entertained much more than the foul factor coming just from wife. The story of bodyguards' mother was not funny. Apart from that the final nature of his step dad.I liked the fertility take the most. The other thing I liked is the clean aspects, like unethical progression in sexual context were absent.

Yes there are less jokes and a lot more dialogue with a lot of back story included with each of the 3 main characters but....There isn't as much action as the first, apparently difficulties filming through the various lock downs but the action in the film is up to parr with the previous.My only grumble with the film is the plot involving Morgan Frerman?

47,bob-the-movie-man,A movie that's a pain in the A-double-dollar sign.,5,22 June 2021,"Positives:
As a comedy thriller, it does pass the '6 laughs test' in terms of the 'comedy' element. Some of these are minor chuckles. A few are really good belly laughs.Among these are some of the outrageous tirades of Salma Hayek: her accent makes some of the dialogue unintelligible, but given its X-rated nature, that's not necessarily a bad thing! As a mid-50's actress (Oh God - - don't tell her I mentioned her age!), Ms Hayek indeed has an arrestingly attractive form.Seeing Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman on the screen is never anything other than a positive. (Although Banderas is like Sean Connery in failing to tailor his natural accent to any role he's ever in!)Negatives:
A general problem I have with 'comedy thrillers' is that the comedy nearly always negates any of the thrills. Ryan Reynolds is not playing Deadpool in this one, although he might as well be doing so based on the number of times he is hit by cars and other solid objects. The result is that although it has the trappings of a Bond or a Bourne - exotic locations (here, mostly Italian ones) ; exotic woman; car chases; heavily-armed henchmen; huge explosions - it delivers none of the tension or excitement. When matched with some rather dodgy post-shoot special effects, the effect is generally underwhelming.The plot here is shallow and ludicrous. A McGuffin involving a diamond drill tunnelling into ""Europe's data hub"" to implant a virus is infantile.If there was an award for the clumsiest movie title of 2021, we may already have a winner.Summary Thoughts on ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"": Sequels are very occasionally better. Often they are much worse. This one, I have to say, delivers very much ""more of the same"". Given that the writer/director team of Tom O'Connor and Patrick Hughes are in the driving seat, that's not much of a surprise. The shtick is mildly diverting, occasionally downright funny, but quickly outstays its welcome. The 100 minute run time felt, for me, much longer.Looking back at my 2017 review of the first film, I think I was being over-kind giving it 6/10. I think this is neither better nor worse. So if you want to average the two and give each 5/10, I wouldn't object! But, again, it's one I will struggle to remember much about in a few month's time.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web or Facebook.

It just became almost incomprehensible.Since everyone is indestructible, you can't care about the action or the characters anymore. It's just filler.

I barely knew what happened in the first one, but fortunately that's not necessary to enjoy this stupid, ridiculous, yet hilarious sequel.The casting was awesome. Salma Hayek was incredible as the crazy and madly in love wife of the notorious hitman played by Samuel Jackson. She managed to be even crazier than her husband. Their chaotic and loud relationship provided so much intense and vulgar jokes that I thoroughly enjoyed. Ryan Reynolds returned as the failing bodyguard who tried to cope while wanting to kill himself whenever he's with the chaotic hitman couple. I loved the chemistry between the trio and there was a lot of fun with them.The action sequences were another entertaining part of the movie. They were over-the-top and violent. The editing can be very quick and choppy a lot of times, but the actions felt very fast and most importantly, fun.The quickest part of the movie was definitely the story. Clearly the direction and script did not care so much about crafting a coherent plot. The main arc itself, which was a digital virus that would wipe out the whole Europe, was ridiculous and stupid. Characters changed erratically and in dumb ways.Also, when I saw Frank Grillo in the movie, I immediately got excited because he's a badass. However, sadly he only said some vulgar stuff and didn't do much. The same was for Morgan Freeman, who also had very little screen time.Despite the obviously dumb plot, it's important to know that this movie's main and only goals were mindless fun and messed-up comedy. So don't mind the low critic's scores on Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic. Instead, the audience's score was a much better reflection.Overall, great character chemistry, dumb comedy and action that I thoroughly enjoyed. 7/10.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

The original flick was a straightforward, dumb action-comedy movie with a bunch of Hollywood stars attached to the project, which was always going to be financially successful. Fan-favorite comedic actors like Ryan Reynolds (Pokémon Detective Pikachu) and Samuel L. Jackson (Spiral) bantering for over an hour-and-a-half? Of course, viewers will run to the theaters...This sequel follows pretty much the same formulas of its predecessor. Every remotely emotional moment or storyline is replaced by a random joke or nonsensical action sequence. A vast majority of the dialogues feel like stand-up comedy or improv from the actors. Even the villain portrayed by Antonio Banderas (Dolittle) checks all the caricatural boxes of the ""bad guy"". From the writing to Patrick Hughes' (The Hitman's Bodyguard) direction, it all feels too familiar and unexciting.The bloated runtime, the overwhelming amount of jokes, and some rough language might be a tad too much for some audience members, but the phenomenal chemistry between every cast element is enough to compensate for an otherwise forgettable flick. Hopefully, a more than certain third film won't add more apostrophes to its title...Rating: C.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

All kidding aside, as an Action Comedy; The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard does just enough! An extremely self-aware execution that knows well about its boundaries and limitations.The perfect blend of Serviceable Visuals, Delightful Humor, and plenty of Ludicrous character chitchats; all that stuff turned it into a complete popcorn flick. Before you say anything; I know It's awfully cliché, outrageously generic, and clearly over the top but the truth is that we all seen this coming. Didn't we? That's why we got ourselves here in the first place, isn't that right?Now, barring its explicit cheesiness and second-rate CGI, there are some fine pieces of Action as well. Fistfights, Guns, Explosions; you are getting the whole package. As for the segment of Comedy; I gotta tell ya, Jokes may not always land but whenever they do; it's efficient and will make you laugh.And the Onboard cast has made a significant contribution in making it all work. Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L Jackson, Salma Hayek; it is quite clear that these three have carried this entire film. The arresting chemistry between these actors was a bonus. And Oh! I almost forgot; Morgan Freeman is there too. What a Guy!",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

57,trinaboice,Funny but exhausting and vulgar,6,17 June 2021,"IN A NUTSHELL:
The bodyguard Michael Bryce continues his friendship with assassin Darius Kincaid as they try to save Darius' wife Sonia. The goofy action flick is directed by Patrick Hughes and is the sequel to The Hitman's Bodyguard. The trailer for the film tells you exactly what to expect: tons of bloody action, gorgeous locations, a stacked cast, snarky humor, and a bloated plot. You WILL laugh and be entertained, despite a few of the film's flaws.THINGS I LIKED:
Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, and Salma Hayek made such an entertaining, killer trio. Some critics are saying they phoned it in, but I disagree. They all look great, especially Salma Hayek even though there are jokes about her age. She's actually 54 years old, but she looks absolutely fantastic. They are the magic that makes this movie so fun.The cast also includes the wonderful Morgan Freeman, Antonio Banderas, Academy Award winner Gary Oldman, Tom Hopper, and Frank Grillo among others.You get to travel to a lot of beautiful destinations including England and Italy. They actually filmed some of the movie in beautiful Croatia.Some really crazy stunts. Most of them are incredible, while a few are so over-the-top and exaggerated that they are funny in a good way.I always love twists.Tons of humor.Tons of action sequences.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
It definitely helps to have seen the first movie to understand the dynamics of the characters and this hitman life.I adore Salma Hayek, but sometimes I couldn't understand what she was saying.As much as I get a kick out of Ryan Reynolds, he kind of plays the same character in every movie.Some of the CGI fire and explosions looked fake.The title of the movie doesn't exactly roll off your tongue.There are a lot of flashbacks that provide jokes but often drag down the pacing.The plot is completely unimportant and no one will care about it or even remember it 5 minutes after watching the movie.There could have been some heartwarming and emotional moments, but the film squashes them with humor instead.Overall, the movie is loud and mindnumbing.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
This movie is NOT appropriate for kids.Tons of bloody violence
Tons of profanity, including sooooo many F-bombs, crude and vulgar language
Conversations and portrayal of ""doing it""
Lots of destruction
You see dead, bloodied bodies
Lots of cleavage
There is a complete disregard for human lifeYou can see my full review on my Movie Review Mom YouTube channel!",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

Except if you count Salma Hayek's performance who clearly is the stand out here. Both Jackson and Reynolds play second fiddle to Hayek's outrageous performance. She's crass, vulgar but undeniably sexy. Hearing her drop F Bombs every other sentence in her strong Mexican accent is hilarious. Other than that this sequel has nothing new to offer.Ryan Reynolds plays the same character here as he has done all throughout his career. This is by no means a bad thing as he always delivers the laughs. Samuel L Jackson is once again playing a caricature of himself. The chemistry between the three is what sells this film and keeps the movies head above water. Antonio Banderas is the villain. It's obvious like the rest of the cast, he's having a whale of a time. For the most part we the audience are too. There's some recycling of gags from the first movie but hey, recycling is good right?The plot is too old hat to even bother with so I won't even go there. We're here for the action and Director Patrick Hughes has proven he's more than capable in this department.Sadly though who ever hired Ryan Reynolds stunt double must have been blind as a bat. It was often jarring and apparent that a double was being used for most of Reynolds action scenes. Hell! I look more like Ryan Reynolds than his stunt double does and I'm a short fat middle aged bloke!I really enjoyed the first movie and hoped for a sequel. Possibly my expectations were set too high. This follow up like 'A Quiet Place Part 2' is entertaining but not a patch on the original.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
61,BrnzReviews,Ignore The Negative Reviews This Was Great!,9,6 July 2021,"Hitmans bodyguard was a classic comedy starring Ryan Reynolds as the bodyguard and Samuel L. Jackson as the hitman once again and truly is such a funny film. This movie has taken that comedy and tried to up it a level and dont get me wrong it is a very funny film but it lacks the story aspects as the first one, comedy wise and action wise its great and definately worthy of the watch but don't go into this expecting a major storyline to keep you engossed within it, its the type that the comedy is where its at and without it it would probably just be another sequel.Samuel L. Jackson & Ryan Reynolds have this great type of chemistry, two actors who are in completely different types of movies compared to each other but can work so well together it's truly inspring. Its an interesting take to see the hitmans wife get involved a little more, but as usual he is a bodyguard of many talents annoying being one of them, i really enjoyed this and I'd highly recommend it to everyone, no matter what kind of movie goer you are, this is worth every minute so check it out now!",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

This movie has none of the good qualities that the first film had. Sure, it has comedy, and yes, this movie did make me laugh sometimes, but it wasn't nearly as funny as the first. And the action just looks terrible compared to the original. The original had smooth action scenes, with great camera work and choreography. The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard's action is not only worse, but it's lacking in the amount of scenes.So, the comedy and action is worse, now what else? The script. The antagonist is just terrible. He's the least bit interesting and cliched to bits, and I already forgot his name. And the plot is dumb beyond belief. The whole story starts because an Interpol agent decided to hire a hitman, a bodyguard, and the hitman's wife to save all of Europe. And what's worse is that he just hired them after they killed his informant. Then after being questioned, he says to not worry because they're ""idiots"". If they're ""idiots"", then why would you hire them in the first place? You literally put the fate of Europe in the hands of a bunch of ""idiots"". And I know this movie isn't supposed to be intelligent, but this is really bad writing.This film was just a huge let down. It's worse in every way when compared to the original. And if there's going to be anymore more sequels, then I really hope that they look upon this film and improve. Overall, the film's a 3/10, it's a hard pass.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

Overall rating 39/100The worlds most lethal odd couple Bodyguard Michael Bryce (Ryan Reynolds) and hitman Darius Kincaid (Samuel L Jackson) are back on another life threatening mission. Still unlicensed and under scrutiny Bryce is forced into action By Darius's even more volatile wife Sonya (Salma Hayek) the trio get in over there heads in a global plot and soon find that they are all that stand between Europe and a vengeful and powerful madman.This film was just a great big pile of meh. The cinematography was great, I liked the set up for Michael Bryce. The opening was fun. The action was very entertaining in parts, with effective uses of gore. It was very funny in places. Mostly due to the fantastic chemistry between Ryan Reynolds, Salma Hayek and Samuel L Jackson. Who, to be honest were the only thing that made this film watchable. I liked some of the new characters introduced, how the two storylines were set up and formed together was well done, and the final act was fun enough.But the pacing was all over the place and extremely rushed, with a complete lack of explanation to half the scenes, it was just dragging you along expecting you to keep up. It was painfully generic and predictable. The villain and a lot of the film was corny, and sorry Antonio Banderas but awful. A lot of the characters and the movies humour just got annoying about halfway through and it just turned into screaming matches. The plot was very oddly structured in parts. The script was terrible and felt like it was a scrapped idea from the 80's. There were so many lapses in the logic that just didn't make sense. The editing was chaotic and choppy, they thought adding more explosions and overusing some comedic moments could mask the mediocrity of the film and it didn't. There was some extremely poor and predictable plot twists, and frankly just unneeded attempts at character depth and background that just fell flat.So, overall The Hitman's bodyguard 2 is just about entertaining and funny enough to be a possible fun diversion for some. With undeniable chemistry between the three leads. But the novelty eventually wears off, and all you are left with is a painfully predictable and generic, mediocre film that adds nothing new to the genre and was a sequel that frankly shouldn't of been made, despite the cast trying there hardest.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
70,gavinp9,Fun & fast,7,13 June 2021,"'The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard' is a sequel to the 2017 ""odd-couple"" film, where Michael Bryce (Reynolds) is a bodyguard to hitman Darius Kincaid (Jackson). This time around, Darius' wife Sonia (Hayek) is added to the mix, with pleasing results! Plot is pretty simple - Darius & Sonia are attempting to have a belated honeymoon in Europe, and Bryce is attempting to have a sabbatical from bodyguarding. They end up getting involved in foiling Papadopolous' (Banderas) plan to take down Europe data servers.Nice to see lots of pre-covid Europe - Italy, Croatia, UK - and also plenty of car chases/explosions/gun fights. The film does well to tread the line between action & comedy and covers both bases equally well. The highlight is definitely the dysfunctional relationship between Reynolds, Jackson & Hayek - plenty of great lines and quips. Also nice to see Morgan Freeman, as well as blond/evil Banderas.Plenty of unbelievable moments, but lots of them played for laughs. Plays like a well-made Bond spoof. The dream sequences are particularly funny, with Reynolds' charm always coming through. Very satisfying ending - I'm on board for the third!",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

It isn't masterpiece and will never win any awards. But Its entertaining throughout and the pacing is great so that doesn't matter. My main issue with this one, compared to the previous has to do with the comedy aspect. The first one had me cracking up non-stop. This time around I maybe cracked a laugh a couple of times.

(""I'm going to come for you and get you ha ha ha"" type lines).The extras look like professionals in mimicking real acting, than actually really acting.Hollywood hasn't worked out that movies are an escape from peoples daily lives, and to get any upbeat movie (at all) is like candy.

Michael's peace is soon disturbed when Sonia Kincaid (Salma Hayek) forces him to rescue her husband Darius (Samuel L. Jackson). Thus the three end up facing Aristotle Papdopolous (Antonio Banderas), who threatens Europe with a virus. Michael must now work with the deranged duo to protect Europe from the virus.This sequel comes across in a similar, but appropriate way. The action scenes in the film come across in an exaggerated but entertaining way. The action scenes are put together a bit quickly and filmed with some movement, but fortunately the entertainment of the film is not lost because of this. One explosion is also a bit more believable than the other.The friend-enemy relationship between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson comes across in an entertaining way again. Despite the fact that the chemistry between these two works well, Salma Hayek manages to steal the film with her busy comedic character. It's fun to follow this trio on their mission through Southern Europe. In addition to the three protagonists, the rest of the film cast also delivers good acting. One just has a bigger role than the other. Antonio Banderas looks more like a villain from an old James Bond movie.

There are a few nice tries, but, that's all.The effort of creating fun is there, but, it doesn't deliver. It only goes so far as to make this be not boring, but, it's not fun, except in a few short stretches.For example, there's a great setup for a joke and some fun regarding Selma Hayek's age. A younger woman makes a reference to it in a night-club. But, then... nothing. We just see that Selma's angry about it. Well, yes, any woman her age would be. She's angry and then starts shooting people. So, unless you're a woman who wanted to shoot people in such situations several times, it's not fun, really. Compare this to, say, the running joke on Sofia Vergara's age in Hot Pursuit, which was a little funny and _much_ more fun.Don't get me wrong, Selma Hayek looks _amazing_ for her age, which is somewhat expected. The movie does look good overall.Also, the pairing of Samuel L Jackson and Morgan Freeman is completely waisted. There had to be so much to do here, with Mace Windu meeting the US president...The original was not very good, but, better than this. Let's hope there's no more sequels.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

The story is rather boring and rather hash scenario just to put everybody in this situation. The characters and joke aren't that funny to the point some jokes are made again. Ryan's just a center of abuse the whole film. Sonia's character in the first was good as a filler between Darius & Michael scenes. However she's more in the forefront in this and when you have her combined with Darius just freaking it and shouting F bombs every two minutes & talking about Sex it gets real tired real quick. Banderas just like Gary Oldman is a good actor his voice alone just screams bad guy, but he's not in the movie until much later and his whole plan involving Greece doesn't really add up when the majority of the film takes place in Italy.

82,darkreignn,A 7/10 on entertainment value alone,7,21 June 2021,"""Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" isn't a complex film - in fact, in some ways it's barely a film; this movie could be seen as a one hour and forty minute long collection of clips, all of which end with a silly punchline or ridiculous gag. Seemingly made for the ADD, MTV generation, ""Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" moves from scene to scene without hesitation - one joke comes after another after another, rinse and repeat, until the credits start rolling (and even then, more jokes await). And I loved it.This movie was pure, straight up popcorn entertainment from beginning to end - but what else can you expect from a film titled ""Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard""? You're not getting high art here, and you're not even getting a semblance of the comprehensible story the first film had. More of a parody of ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" than a parody of classic action movies, ""Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" takes the dial, turns it to 11, and then rips it off. Everything is notched up to the extreme here, from the jokes, to the action, to the characters and the story they inhabit. Nothing that occurs during the plot feels remotely believable, but that's part of the fun - as long as you can roll with it.Just like in the first film, Patrick Hughes directs some competent, bloody action. You get your fair share of violence here, and it's certainly a blast to watch, made even more fun due to the film's three leads. Ryan Reynolds, Samuel L. Jackson, and Salma Hayek have fantastic chemistry, and you can tell they're having a blast in their roles. They are so good around each other that practically every single joke lands. From Ryan Reynolds' deadpan delivery, to Samuel L. Jackson and Salma Hayek's violent outbursts, watching their personalities collide with each other never got old, and unsurprisingly, made for some of the film's most hilarious moments.While not as laugh out loud funny as the first movie, ""Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" was consistently entertaining, and constantly humorous, even if I didn't find myself laughing as hard as I did with the previous film. The jokes come so fast and so often that I was practically always chuckling; at the end of the movie, my face hurt from smiling. I'm not lying when I tell you this movie is fun - it's engineered to be a good time, and it certainly is. I can tell you with confidence that if you're a fan of the three main leads, you'll like this film. But is there anything you won't enjoy?For one, while the ridiculous and overblown story was part of the entertainment value, it did throw me off, especially since the first film's story did feel somewhat believable. Nothing in this movie can ever, or will ever happen, which makes it hard to relate to real-world occurrences. Also, because of the almost constant rate of comedy, the movie hardly has any serious moments to it - in fact, I'm struggling to think of any one moment that took itself 100% seriously without the incorporation of some type of gag. For some, these things may not be an issue, but for me, it honestly did take some getting used to; however, once I figured out the type of movie I was getting, I could easily adjust and settle in for the ride.""Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" seeks to be nothing else other than entertaining. If you're looking to sit back, relax, and watch a movie where you can leave your brain by the door and laugh, this is it. It's not quite as good as the first film, but it's certainly just as fun.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

Salma Hayek is still too hot for many to handle. Antonio Banderas, as good as he is but still off for the role, i must add.

The cinematography is passable, and music not horrible.There ends all the positives.All the rest is just noise. Dumb, stupid, nonsens noise. Salma is particularly annoying and is both horribly cast and phoning in coursewords like Bruce Willis after a bottle of vodka.

Ad to the mix Salma Hayek, the fast-talking, femme fatale wife of said bodyguard and you had all the sparks necessary to retain the brainless fun of the first film.Unfortunately, the jokes are too formulaic and repetitive and the physical comedy too mundane to generate any big laughs. Antonio Banderas and Morgan Freeman are criminally underutilized in their supporting roles.The scenic locales and the high production value action sequences don't accomplish much given the writing and the bedrock of mad cap comedy that made its predecessor such a hit is sorely off the mark.This film illustrates that even slapstick, so-called brainless humour films requires creative writing and witty dialogues to spur interest.Another example of a solid comedy that shouldn't have been sequel-ized, Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard is a big let down despite its talented cast who unfortunately, werent backed up by good writing.Not recommended! Even die-hard Ryan Reynolds fan will cringe at this one.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
91,PCC0921,Runtime Can Be the Key Sometimes,7,23 June 2021,"Released: June 16th, 2021
Viewed: June 21st, 2021The surprise hit of 2017 was the Hitman's Bodyguard (2017). The movie only cost 30 million dollars and made over double that in the States. Double that total, plus a little more and you get the worldwide take, so, the movie made a lot of money and that is why we are here now. It is a formula that has been seen before, involving huge stars, huge stunts, comedy and action. The tried and true buddy comedy formula, in the first film, involved a convergence with Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson. It was a hit and didn't anger the critics much. So, now we have the sequel.In addition to Reynolds and Jackson is Salma Hayek, who plays Jackson's, Darius Kincaid's, heavily charged wife, Sonia. This film brings her character to the center stage (considering her character was used, in some ways, in a wasted way, sitting in a jail the whole first movie, talking on the phone a lot. This is not including a great flashback sequence explaining how they met), because it looks like she is out of jail for this film. As was seen in the first film, Jackson's seasoned hitman has angered many criminal organizations and again he is in danger after being kidnapped by another group, who wants him dead. Enter Reynolds', Michael Bryce, the triple graded bodyguard, turned broken man, who has finally conquered his demons after many lengthy psychiatrist appointments and found a place to rest, until Sonia finds him. She comes enlisting his aid to search for his old, kidnapped buddy, Kincaid.What this film tried to do was correct the flaws, that the first film had, but created it's own flaws, making this film no worse of better than the last film. They are fairly close in quality with each other. One of the flaws this film fixed from the first film came from the runtime. This film was 15-20 minutes shorter, which was nice. The first film was a little bit too long, which effected its pacing. It rolled up and down, from action to non-action and from comedy to crime. It had a problem identifying itself as either a comedy, action film or something else. The pacing lost its way, to the point, that we kept forgetting about Gary Oldman's bad guy character, because he would pop up out of nowhere, just sniveling, lying and crying. He would be another wasted character in that film. The runtime of this film helps contain everything in a much better, tighter, compact package.Along they way, the three of them become embroiled in a terrorist-type plot to destroy Europe, led by new bad guy, Aristotle Papdopolous, played effectively by Antonio Banderas. We also meet Bryce's father, who was hailed as the greatest bodyguard ever, but never appreciated Bryce himself. You'll have to figure it out on your own, who the actor is, who plays Bryce's father. It's kind of a spoiler, so I'm not mentioning it here.Another flaw they corrected in this film was the character building. The pacing that this film establishes from the start helps the plot explain the characters backgrounds better. We learn a lot more about Kincaid and Sonia. We learn a lot more about Bryce's backstory. It makes these characters more tangible and you understand more about why they are the way they are. So, by putting a better human face on the characters, it allows you to cheer them on more.Compared to Gary Oldman's bad guy in the first film, Antonio Banderas' Aristotle character has a much better, fleshed out, personality, that we can understand. He has a reason why he is doing what he is doing. He has a background that explains a lot more and the emotions released by his character are more grounded and not teetering to one side too much. He also has a closer connection to our anti-heroes, which drives the plot ahead. Samuel L. Jackson does what he does well and his contrast to Hayek, although, kind-of, unbelievable, still works well in this film.Unbelievability is a necessary evil that you have to accept in these films to enjoy them. Case in point, Reynolds and his Bryce character. This man gets hit by so many cars in these movies and gets up with only scratches. By the time you are done with this film, you eventually accept this unbelievable character ability as one of his character's attributes. It's part of his persona in this film's universe. It's part of the comedy relief of this film. What I liked about his performance in the first film carried over into this film. A lot of Reynold's recent performances have been high energy, over-the-top renditions. I do not bring that fact up as a negative though, especially the Deadpool movies, but in the case of these films, it was nice seeing a more subdued, lower-energy Reynolds. By bringing his broken bodyguard's energy down, it helped emphasize the frailty and childness of Bryce's character. It also helped make some of the unbelievable comedy moments, that his character was involved in, easier to consume and more humorous.What hurts this film, is the action to comedy ratio. This one felt like it wanted to be funnier then the last one. It was relying a little too much on the silliness. This is more evident by the reduction in action sequences in favor of bad humor or silly reaction shots. I was really surprised to see that the budget for this film was twice as big as the last one, because on the surface this film looked like the budget was cut. Maybe the flash and fireworks was cut back for actor's salaries? Maybe Covid protocols played a part in it? I have no idea what would be the reason why this film looks cheaper than the last one.So, each film has their issues and their strengths. Despite the flaws, these films still deliver well enough to be entertaining and to be seen. You could piggy-back them together into one huge film and this film is a nice, compact, shorter, piece of work, that can be clipped to the end of the first one. In the case of this film, it delivers better pacing, an easier plot to follow and characters you can understand better, but by sacrificing some of the good attributes found in the first film, they manage to create some moments of silly boredom, compounded by not as many laughs. Still, not bad.7.1 (C MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

It was a below-average movie despite the famous cast and the huge budget. The plot brought NOTHING new, and the dialogue is very lackluster. The worst thing about it is that it's filled with stupid things and plot holes you can't just ignore them.Pros: It's independent from its Prequel (Hitman's Bodyguard), so you can watch this while not having watched the first one.Cons: Almost everything else is a con. It just felt like the director wanted to make a sequel just to make a sequel without any effort to make it feel unique.The Dialogue feels like it's written by some twenty-year-old amateur. The plot is very inconsistent and the entire idea of ""Destroying Europe with a Virus"" is so dumb you can't just turn a cold eye on it.Oh and Bruce, our protagonist, somehow never dies, not with a bullet, not with a dozen cars stumbling into him at a significant speed.I can't just go on and tell you every little thing that is wrong with the movie.

111,Dr_Mark_ODoherty,Funny film about the profession of body-guarding and guardianship.,10,9 August 2021,"This is a very funny action film, I think, about a swashbuckling hitman and his super-attractive wife,
who swear as often and enthusiastically as they can - to the dismay of their super-correct bodyguard.I also think that one should take this audacious - as well as a bit annoying - action film as a cautionary tale; that bravery and fiery courage have to be tempered with prudence, caution and altruistic values :)There is of course the proverb ""Fortune favours the bold"" - but in my experience that only applies about 50/50 of the time. However, the odds of successfully completing a mission of body-guarding increase tremendously, if one has a sense of propriety and cultivates good manners - which improves ones ability of guardianship when protecting virtue, goodness and decency :)In short, this film is lacking a bit of a spiritual and ethical component - as well as political correctness. After all, Americans are quite virtuous and spiritual-minded, I think. So I think we should just stick with that American tradition, and go into battle with the Almighty and a Guardian Angel at our side - regardless if that gun-fight turns out to be a tragedy or comedy :)",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

No story apart from a very simple bad guy trying to blow something up and the team have to somehow stop him by somehow coming together.Ryan Reynolds, Sam L Jackson and Salma Hayek are type casted perfectly as they were in the first film. There are a bunch of proper laugh out loud moments involving Sam Jackson famous line with guns, guts and violence. Rocking around famous locations and was nice to see a bit of sunshine from different counties.Then this is where it goes down hill, Hayek doenst have to scream every time a gun is pulled! The story is non existent! Just another cast member used poorly like Gary Oldman, Antonio Banderes being a typically latin and telling everyone hes master plan. The Twist was terrible having morgan freeman as Bryces adopted father who then double crosses them to the bad guy.Its funny the first time, will be ok to watch the next time and then probably be dead by the third.

When the movie calms down for a second and takes a few deep breaths it's actually quite funny but this doesn't happen enough. Also the digital effects look all wrong. It's better to have fewer practical effects that look right than loads of digital effects which look wrong.,Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
127,ThomDerd,"Excuzzz me, what's the bad guy's plan again?",6,22 August 2021,"Banderas is now Greek. And wants to wreck havoc in the EU. Although the movie was (at times) fun and it's cool to see Samuel Jackson and Morgan Freeman in the same film, a star-packed cast can't get this film rated above 6. And 6 is already too much.Where to start...Pace is inconsistent and compared to the 1st film there are some really boring parts. Action is focused on bang-bang and car chase, coupled with some extreme shouting from Salma Hayek. Acting is ok (if you can stand Hayek).Storyline is outdated and exaggerated but keeps the European vibe of the first film, which is consistent.Comedy is prevalent throughout the film and there are some good moments.And of course...Antonio Banderas:
He plays the villain, Greek billionaire Aristotle Papadopoulos, but he doesn't take the role too seriously and he still is the one and only Antonio Banderas, with the one and only Spanish accent we all know. He delivers some funny one-liners mixed with a few popular Greek words and almost looks like a villain BUT with a really weak and bad plan.Comedian Ryan Reynolds does well in comedy.Frank Grillo is always a nice addition, even though his role in the film is not essential.Nice cinematography, photography and great Italian landscapes. And some truly funny moments.Maybe since they're chasing a Greek, they should have done more shots in Greece, so it could have been more relevant. Because in the overall story the connection with Italy seemed rather weak.To conclude, there's a few reasons to watch this film. But it's not as good as the previous one, so be prepared.I personally enjoyed it but it's no more than a 6/10.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
128,alexscott-35299,Very disappointed!,5,21 June 2021,"So after I really enjoyed the first film, I had high expectations for this one. I found myself very disappointed during the film when I realised that this film is just full of action cliches and boring scenarios. The comedy is great just like the first one but it's not enough yo carry this film, Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson really do carry this film and are the only things that make it watchable. For how good the cast is I really expected this to be amazing and a great follow up but instead it was just so so disappointing, every action scene was unwatchable and sometimes it was just hard to understand what was even happening because of the awful shaky camera work. The story didn't feel like it was progressing ever and just felt like it was the same scenes over and over again just in new settings. Honestly I can't believe how terrible this film is and if it wasn't for the hilarious dialogue the rating would have been way way lower. Disappointed!",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
129,waltermwilliams,Hitman Sequel Is Never Boring.,7,14 June 2021,"Sequels rarely work because it's all been done before in the original so the plot lines are usually a case of SSDD.This is where ""The Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" is different.It's a fresh take on characters well established after the first movie which I also gave 70% score too upon reflection.A number of key creatives in both cast and crew return for this sequel, which is probably why it doesn't fall into the usual sequel syndrome and fail.Amongst those making another appearance on the big screen are Salma Hayek and Richard E. Grant, but the newbies are Antonio Banderas and Frank Grillo plus another huge name almost bigger than God!One of the biggest surprises in this movie is the man who plays Mike Bryce's (Ryan Reynolds) father seemingly retired from Hitman duties and living in Tuscany.Even Assassin Darius Kincaid (Samuel L. Jackson) was left speechless when introduced for the first time on screen...although in real life these two actors have worked together before on stage, but not in a feature film and Jackson considers him a mentor.It's a big year for Reynolds whose ""Free Guy"" is also finally being released in 2021.Like the first film this one was also shot entirely on location in Europe with some amazing backdrops in Italy, Croatia, Slovenia, Bulgaria and the UK.The first film put Michael Bryce into therapy, but this sequel will put him into hospital after he is hit by a car, run over by a boat, punched in the face, shot, stabbed, burnt and drowned.He's the Road Runner of Live Action Cinema.Get on board this second road trip from hell that even involves an E Type Jaguar.You'll laugh till it hurts, but Im sure the stunts hurt Reynolds even more.Hit me baby one more time with this action, comedy, crime sensation!The Aussie Connection: Australian born Writer, Producer and Director Patrick Hughes continues to establish himself as one of Hollywoods most in demand film-makers...grossing millions worldwide at the box office.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

The real treat of the first one was the bickering between Ryan and Samuel. Now there is some of that but not nearly enough to make up for how boring the first half of the movie is.When the real action starts, it makes up for the lack of humour in this movie. Even a surprise appearance by Morgan Freeman was a missed opportunity for a good chuckle. If they had gotten Kevin Costner as his dad, that would have made for a greater laugh than Samuel being surprised that Morgan was Ryan's dad (stepdad). The black thing was just low hanging fruit. A nod to Kevin Costner and Whitney Houston's ""The Bodyguard"" would have resonated more. This definitely felt more like a rushed movie to capitalize off the first movie's relative success as I'm sure if this had waited a year or 2, it definitely wouldn't have been made.

137,PerryAtTheMovies,"Not a fulfilling movie, but funny as hell....",6,16 June 2021,"Initial Thoughts:
Well, it was definitely a funny movie for the first half of the film. I laughed pretty much all the way through until the action decided to finally arrive. However, constantly trying to laugh gets exhausting when you're in theatres to see an action movie. I guess doesn't really matter how many high-profile actors you put into one movie. Eventually, you hit a wall and think to yourself, ""I guess this is the best we're going to get."" This is especially true when you don't feel like a movie has fulfilled you.I could nitpick each performance, but I won't bore you with all that. Instead I will mention my one peeve about the villain. Not ""evil"" enough and not convincing enough. Other than a little spiel at the beginning of the film I wasn't convinced of the bad side. The bad side shows up for 5 minutes and then not again until the final quarter of the movie. This film ended up being more of a comedy love affair than an actual action movie like I had hoped for. Each lead did a stellar job in their roles for a time, but like I said earlier, things just got stale. An example of staleness is it's funny the first couple times you eject from a car unscathed to be hit from somewhere else, but anything past three became boring.The last negative I'll touch on is the visual effects. It faltered a few times throughout most notably near the end when characters are running from an explosion and they look super animated, with superspeed, doing the impossible. I know this movie needn't be taken seriously, but there's just a few things you would expect from a sequel/big budget film. Other visuals that got over used are the explosions at odd times and the endless barrage of gun fire with no reloads. Again, this same repetition of lacking, or too much, becomes tiresome.Back to the top on comedy. This movie was definitely funny for good chunk of its time and it didn't feel forced. Others in the theatre also found the movie funny as much as I did, so I'm not entirely out to lunch. The comedy could have been reduced a bit to help focus on the story, but overall for me there, well-done. Lastly, the music for the film I thoroughly enjoyed. Like the first film I found that the music selection worked out well for the scenes they were chosen for. In some place it definitely enhanced a scene.Overall:
This film was probably 65/35 on the comedy to action ratio. I found that to be semi-bad, but still enjoyable. One should not expect a serious movie, but should be able to still find some entertainment value. If you've been waiting to see this film than I'd suggest waiting for it to stream, but if you can't wait. A cheap night at your local theatre would be the better option.""Should I watch this movie?"" My answer is 'Yes, later rather than sooner'.Enjoy the show!",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

157,grarunkumar1994,Not worth the time.,4,4 July 2021,"Hitman's Bodyguard was a hit mostly due to the contrast between the lead characters who both were hugely popular thanks to MCU films. Both the characters were absoulute opposites- a ruthless hitman and a bodyguard who works by the book. The charm of Sam Jackson and Ryan Reynolds did help a lot with a plot that was not usual.The sequel however doesn't have any of that advantages. Sam Jackson doesn't have the same charm he had in first film and a Ryan Reynolds trying too hard to be the one he portrays in social media acting as a decent guy. He has become too much monotonous that its boring now. He's no deadpool here yet he acts like one occasionally.Totally ridiculous was the addition of Salma Hayek's character which is reckless and dumb most part of the film, acting like a 10 year. Although written to be funny, nothing in the film is enjoyable even a bit. Surprise addition was Morgan Freeman in a role which got ruined immediately with Ryan's unconvincing interaction.Overall a nonsense film with no logic, yet completely unentertaining thanks to poor writing and acting.Except for Freeman there's nothing in the film worth the time.Ryan should try more diverse roles than 'confused-action hero'.Below Average.!

For this movie though you have to remove the messy rushed plot, unbelievable plot armor and predictability from your mind to make it as fun as people are saying.

I just didn't expect it to be ""SOOOOO annoying"". Her delivery of lines sounds so fake, deliberate and annoying, her role seems so redundant in this sequel, I just wish they had taken another option in story-plot, one where she's not the main character and her voice wouldn't be heard THAT much. If there is ever a 3rd sequel where Salma Hayek is the main character again, I don't think I'd even TRY to watch it cos I don't think I can survive another 10 minutes of her fake swearing.On the whole, this sequel simply did not serve justice to its first, even the jokes.

182,jditch,Very Bad Design Choices.,3,17 June 2021,"Firstly the sound was abysmally poor and I really expect better. The treble on sound effects was extremely high, whilst the rest of the sound was quite low. It wasn't the cinema, it was the film. The beginning is almost unwatchable for this reason.The editing is atrocious too. Good stuntwork is wasted with 2 seconds of stunt footage displayed. Talking of cutting, the entire film is basically 1-³ second shots stitched together. It's awful to follow.The script was piss poor. I don't expect mega scripts for my Ryan Reynolds films, but I do expect to not be bored all the way through by them. This one was a bad one for sure. There's nothing surprising and it's edited in a way that reveals all its secrets before they even play out.Lastly, the film's understanding of Europe and infrastructure is so bad it's almost amusing. I'm not sure they even looked at a map of Europe before basing their film here. It would have helped.Final criticism Samuel L Jackson/ Morgan Freeman attheir absolute worst.

They were very well developed and had good character arcs. Especially Ryan Reynolds' and Selma Hayek's character.The story was a pretty decent basic, but cliche, world's going to end unless we stop it story but it was still decently told (I am biased because I do like those kind of stories) and the dialogue was sometimes cringy, but mostly pretty good. Where they messed up was the villain.They casted Antonio Banderas who is an amazing actor but unless my ears were deceiving me he had his same Hispanic accent when the character called for a different more European accent. Either the studio didn't give him a lot of time to create a different accent or he just didn't want. He did a good job, but if they would have changed his nationality to something more appropriate for his accent or casted someone else then it would have been better.Overall the movie is worth your time and money.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

The action is great on the big screen.The story is very repetitive and predictable, so my rating is merely from the action, comedy and preferably the two leads of Samuel L Jackson and Salma Hayek.

Salma Hayek is horrendous in what must be the most annoying and obnoxious character ever! She delivers every single line yelling in high pitch and using the most unnecessary vulgar languaje ever, and that's coming from a huge fan of Deadpool, in case you think I'm being squeamish. Samuel LJ has never been less funny. But even though, the movie becomes more watchable whenever Salma Hayek is off-screen.I am surprised with some of the names involved in this mess.I give it a 5 because they certainly made good use of the stunning locations.Ryan Reynolds grabbing a bottle of Aviation Gin, his own brand, brings product placement to a new level.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

This is not some Marvel movie and ain't politically correct movie.It's better than the first one in every way.-The plot isn't something special but its better than the first one.-The chemistry between Jackson, Reynolds and Selma is even better than in the first one. Frankly they make the movie.-The bad guy is pretty cliche, but he's more involved then in the first movie. Banderas is playing him well. Morgan Freeman is also great as always, although he doesn't have a big role.I think the biggest issue people had with this, it's because its a different kind of movie compared to the first one. The first one was more of an action movie with funny moments. While this one is more of an action comedy. It really doesn't take itself too serious, it's vulgar and def not politically correct. Ryan Reynolds character is more of a comic character in this one. In the first one he was cool tough guy bodyguard with a few laughs. In here they took him way down the comic path. He's almost similar to Deadpool.Overall I liked it. It's also really cool to see non politically correct movies these days.

Too, as of late, with Ryan Reynolds all you ever get is violence and a filthy mouth. Even still, I paid hoping to be entertained... sadly a waste of time. The acting is at points rather fair but overall slightly passing. The story line falls into the standard plot and ends with a fizzle. For those who like Reynolds and Jackson, you might find something redeemable and worth your money in watching it... as for us, very disappointing!",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
194,afrocut,What Anguish looks like,3,23 August 2021,"It's done, they did it, they found a way for me to not only hate and never want to hear or see Samuel L. Jackson use the F word but to also find Salma Hayek repulsive. This has got to be one of the worst excruciating forms of visual and audio tortures I've endured in quite awhile. Scene after scene includes watching Ryan Reynolds as Ryan Reynolds be thrown around, made fun of, shot, hit and belittled by every single character in this dreck as Jackson's and Hayek's repulsive characters talk like intoxicated sailors at a filthy strip club. Watching Jackson tongue Hayek is something I never knew I never needed to see and now that I have I feel like I've filled my brain of all the nightmare fuel I'll ever need. Hearing that same pair share orgasmic passion with one another is like hearing a rabid raccon fight a Possum outside your window in the middle of the night...terrifying. Following in suit is a bunch of other once great actors either being misused or completely ruined, including Morgan Freeman, Antonio Banderas and Richard E. Grant. Even new comers are misused, Frank Grillo is hardly here and Tom Hopper hardly has a character. Then there's the score that kept nagging at me as if to scream out that this was a rip off of something else. I spent all night humming the tune and dying for the answer. Finally landing on the King Crimson tune ""21st century Schizoid man"" as the possible culprit. As you can tell, I did not like this movie, but I will admit that the stunt actors, special effects workers and camera operators are giving it their all.

This is totally a fun film filled with lots of action. So, just go to theaters for that and you won't be disappointed.The big 3 of Samuel L Jackson, Ryan Reynolds and Salma Hayek (who is STILL incredibly beautiful) were clearly hamming it up in the film and did this for the easy paycheck which I do not mean as a bad thing but it felt like good friends making a film with no pressure on them because they have nothing to prove anymore and are established legends.The storyline is all over the place; felt like a Quentin Tarantino film with how chaotic it was and running in so many circles.Again, Hitman's Wife Bodyguard was a plain, fun, action film that lacked any importance.Would have been curious how different this film is if the 3 leads were headed by young actors still trying to establish themselves in Hollywood instead of veterans already successful.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

The Rest Of The Cast Is Absolutely Great And Powerful. I Loved That This Sequel Was Fast And A Ready, Go And Die Type Movie And Worked Very Well, Including Explosions And A Ton Of Swearing For The Thrilling Ride.

Ryan Reynolds and Samuel Jackson seem to just jell as a comedic team, and Salma Hayak adds a perfect cherry on top.But the second fails in so many different ways. The jokes feel recycled and unoriginal. The characters don't grow or mature, stuck as tropes of the past...and in many cases get worse.In the first Reynolds was a bodyguard trying to solve problems in an unteneble situation but doing a great job in the finale, proving that he IS actually a great bodyguard. In this one, he's just a useless head case who never does get it together. In fact, the whole ending is a nonsensical jumble we end up being thankful for, just to get it over with.I expected much better from this great cast. 😢",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

Usually, with sequels I re-watch the original to get refresh my memory of who the characters were. I didn't this time and was very annoyed watching this ensemble. I don't get their banter and hostility this time around. It was more irritating than funny.I loved Morgan Freeman's intro which was a good chuckle but he had all of 5 minutes in the movie.Salma was annoying but I can tolerate it because I can't stop admiring her ageless beauty. Sam is Sam just another Al Pacino type actor screaming his lines. Ryan Reynolds always good adding his flair for comedy.

There was some crazy car chasing scenes and big explosions. The VFX and the Cinematography were excellent.I like the addition of Morgan Freeman, Frank Grillo, my favorite, and Antonio Banderas.

There are things this one did better than the first and overall I prefer it to the first one. There wasn't really a joke that failed to hit in this film, regardless of how dark the jokes can get. The chemistry with the main cast is great. I love what they did with the wife in this film and she is the stand out of this film while Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L Jackson are great as always. The action is fun. There was never a dull moment in this film there is always a joke or a piece of action. One thing that this film did better than the first is the depth to the characters and digging into their past.The Bad- The story isn't great is ridiculous and doesn't really work, however it doesn't take away from the fact that this is an entertaining film.Overall Thoughts- Although there are great action and comedy pieces of this film the story is just that bit too muddled up.

I don't remember his character as such in the first film (perhaps I've just forgotten?). The addition of Banderas and Freeman were a nice touch, but they were under utilized to the point that there was no connection to them.

Someone off camera had a check-book in one hand and a gun in the other and saying, ""Do It Now!""
The writing was sloppy and they over emphasize Selma's character so much that she is just another Mary Sue. Although Ryan tries to pull it from the fire a few times with his special brand of sarcasm and humor, it fails on so many levels that this is more flop.

Many fun moments (although tooooo many curse words, at times it just degrades the style) ... funny moments that you don't have in the almost-90min version.For example with the Scottish aid (which i found kind of cute to insert a Scottish way of talking around American English speakers :), and a few other scenes which have disappeared in the shorter version.Also the editing in the 90 min version is weirder than in the long version.To be honest, the 90 min version feels kind of flat ... while i had a real good time when watching the 117 min version.If you didn't appreciate this movie, maybe check which version it was...

-The story wasn't great and is quite predictable
-I struggled to understand what Salma was saying in some scenes, not sure if it was just me, maybe I am going death
-I don't like that they didn't explain what happened with Michael's girlfriend from the first movie
-First movie superiorPositives:
-Just like the first one, there is lots of great action

-Salma did great and played her role really well
-Similar to the first one, Samuel and Ryan had a great relationship and played their roles really well

Including Salma Hayek is not really a good choice. Her acting is mostly yelling and using profanity. Using profanity has made more films funny in the past specially with Samuel L. Jackson and Ryan Reynolds's way of cracking jokes but this movie is not one of them. Those inclusive use of profanity gives out a cringe feeling to the viewer and most of the time it is out of the line and does not have any use to make the movie funnier.

Jackson (S. H. I. E. L. D /Avengers) and Actor Frank Grillo (Boss Level/Avengers) so because of that there is a tend of proactive positive reception.To be honest, the movie is tremendously entertaining and all laughter and comedy scenes makes me feel like watching Ryan Reynolds reenactment of his previous character in several movies in this Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard. . with his witty character.So if any movies contains comedy, I am all in to favor the movies.Critics
The only unnecessary scenes in this movie is the nudity .. which is gross. If the director want to make 3rd installment of hitman bodyguard, please exclude any nudity related scenes.

This movie is so instantly forgettable that a friend had to remind me that Morgan Freeman was even in it. Ryan Reynolds can be good. Buried was an amazing showcase of his range but he just plays varying degrees of Deadpool now and its already well past boring. He needs a better agent because he's appeared in nothing but absolute dross for years now (outside of the original Deadpool and Life). A waste of a talent.,Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

F among other dumb swearing's , then you have the woman who acts like a man and the men who acts like women. This is how women act these days in the USA? Like monkeys?

The movie presents you its own universe, its own series of rules and tries to execute a storyline based on that.That's where this movie shines. This is not Nolan or Tarantino. It is a simple movie with screwed up character. They understand that and explore their qualities and flaws to their limits.It's action packed, a simple story and funny as hell but not in a comic way, but instead just how well the characters are explored.Reynolds and Jackson are as good as you think they are. Even Grillo steals the show when he's on screen but the real diamond of the movie is Hayek.She pulled out a bad ass, sexy, screwed up, violent character so well, that makes you understand why the movie is titled the way it is.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

I really enjoyed this movie but it was a little too long for me . I wish I cut some minor stuff out it would've made it a lot better in my opinion. I think Ryan Reynolds and Samuel L. Jackson are hilarious together and I like the callbacks to the first movie with the ace of bass song. The action is really well filmed. The only other bad thing is I think salma Hayek was kind of annoying but that's a little nit picky. Overall I did enjoy the movie but it's just a little too long for me. I give the hitmans bodyguards wife a 5.5.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

The worst movie in 2021.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
309,dhooghesven,Are you kidding me ?,7,4 July 2021,"After enjoying this sequel I couldn't help myself and started reading the reviews on here. So please allow me to balance out the reviews so far.The movie starts a little while after the first one ended. We find out what happened to ""The Bodyguard"" and with some very creative writing the disaster duo are back at it again for a wild ride in southern Europe. And I do mean WILD !The script in predictable and not very original, but isn't that always the case with spoofs ? Top Secret, Airplane, Hot Shots main story fits on a business card but all became classics. I will let you discover the rest of the story yourself, but please take the negative reviews with a (huge) grain of salt. You don't go to McDonald's for their gourmet cooking.This movie brings back everything you loved from the first flick, adds some amazing performances from A list actors and then turns it up to eleven. The result is over the top humor and mayhem across Europe. The chemistry between the 3 main characters is undeniable, what probably polarizes a lot of viewers. You'll either cringe start to finish or soak it up and ask for seconds.Since this is a sequel I truly can't understand some of the reviews, this isn't a 10/10 movie but certainly not a 1/10 either. What the absolute Frack did you expect ?The people complaining about the language are the worst. Have you ever seen a Samuel L Jackson movie or even a Ryan Reynolds comedy ? Of course you are going to get carpet bombed with ""F bombs"" and naughty language (oh the horror). That reminds me, kudos to Salma Hayek to being the most vulgar of the three.In short if you liked the first one, you'll enjoy this one. J. B spoof, with Loony Tunes slapstick and immature comedy minus a star for a sequel. I say bring on ""The Hitman's Wife's second cousin once removed Bodyguard"".",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
310,smasica-33426,Suffers From 'Sequel Syndrome',5,6 July 2021,"I liked and enjoyed the original because I like Reynolds and Jackson. Salma is a decent actress, too. This film basically suffers from what I call 'Sequel Syndrome'. This is where the writers/director/producers believe that if a little of everything that made the original a good film is fine, then the sequel will be better if they exponentially overdo everything. And I mean everything. I'm no prude and I'm used to some F-bombs dropped into a film for dramatic effect. But this film was ridiculous. Especially Salma's dialog. Yes, she was salty in the original, but here? Wow. Everything from the cardboard villains to the chase scenes to the shootouts to the CGI. Others may not have a problem with this, but I do. Too many potentially good sequels have fallen into this trap. To me, it's sloppy and lazy film making. This could have been so much better. I'm being too generous giving even five stars.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

""Is it possible that... ha-ha, didn´t see that coming"".The sequel tried to repeat it but was predictable. There were no more surprises. Didn´t even smile once.Same goes for this one.

314,TerrificTom,How Do You Hater's NOT Get It?,8,15 July 2021,"I almost didn't watch this movie because of all the hate-reviews. Seriously, there are just so many BAD movies out there I don't have the time or inclination to sift through them all. So I really rely on user reviews to figure out, first off, which movies are NOT worth watching; and second, which movies might be worth watching. A movie can be B-grade and still be worth watching if enough elements come together. An A-grade movie can be a mega-budget mega-blockbuster and still not be worth my time. So I'm always looking for the little clues in the reviews that tell me which is which.So why was this movie, though clearly defective in the plot category worth watching anyway? Because it was FUNNY. Which is, FIRST and FOREMOST, the requirement of a COMEDY. This movie is not first of all a thriller. It's not first of all an action movie. First and foremost a movie with Ryan Reynolds, advertised as a COMEDY has got to be FUNNY. By the way, that includes the Deadpool movies. It includes THIS movie.I laughed during this movie. I laughed in spite of the plot holes and the bad editing and the convoluted, unresolved, and even unbelievable relationships IF the scenes were FUNNY.Not believable. Not exciting. Not emotionally satisfying. But FUNNY.Yes, there were times the humor crashed into absolute absurdity and those scenes were less enjoyable. But even then, in spite of myself, I found myself laughing at the absurdness of it all.Will this be a classic? No. Does it break any new or original ground as comedy, thriller, or action movie? Not even close.But for it's one hour and thirty-two minute runtime (which was long enough without being too long), it was great for what it was. An entertaining comedy.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

You can certainly tell whether or not you're going to enjoy the film within the first 20 minutes.Don't start this film expecting it to be a logical, thoughtout story. It isn't.

Same story, same plot, same actors but a new look, yet imaginably funny. The movie was directed by Patrick Hughes. The cast is unbelievable, Ryan Reynolds as Michael Bryce, Samuel L. Jackson, Salma Hayek as Sonia Kincaid, Morgan Freeman as Michael Bryce Sr. And Antonio Banderas as Aristotle Papdopolous.The movie is the sequel of 2017 super hit The Hitman's Bodyguard which earned $270 million with only $68 million budget. The movie continues from the first one where Michael is having a depression over loosing his AAA license of bodyguarding. Sonia and Darius wanted to have a baby but Aristotle who was a Greek billionaire wanted to put his country in the top of European powers by destroying all other European countries by creating a data hierarchy. That's were Michael, Darius and Sonia come in.One thing I have to admit, this is the best if not one of the best comedy movie in 2021. Jackson as Darius is just mind boggling. There are more than a hundred WTF moments in the movie and Ryan Reynolds is the icing in the cake. There are some cringes between Michael and Sonia which is laughable. Salma as Sonia is astonishing. I was disappointed when Sonia was not used as much as in the first movie. I was surprised by her take on the sequel. The filming locations were all around Europe and it was beautiful. The action sequences were all Michal Bay esque with explosions and body counts all over the place. However the movie is exactly similar to the first movie. A super powerful person wants to be in power of his country and a bodyguard is forced to work with a hitman to save Europe. Antonio Banderas was not used in this movie as I was expecting. Morgan Freeman is just another celebrity cameo in this. The CGI was just bad. The explosions which were hard to shoot were just cartoons and the helicopter rides were full on cartoons which I really hated since it was having over $90 million dollars in budget. The story was copied and original.This movie is super funny. But the plot is extremely boring and predictable. Characters were underused. However this is a star packed comedy where the stars were brilliant in their acting and you should watch the movie.Personal Review: 6.5/10

365,davidgiorgione,Genuinely Hilarious!,9,18 August 2021,"I don't know what's wrong with people nowadays, this movie was really really funny. Although the story doesn't hold the same intrigue as the first, especially the ending, it makes that up entirely in its humor.From start to finish I found myself laughing pretty hard at the dynamic between Jackson, Reynolds, and Hayek, even more so than the first movie. It was absolutely golden even if some of the jokes were low tier or unoriginal, the charisma still made them feel fresh.If you go into a movie titled ""Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard"" expecting them to reinvent the wheel you'll be sorely disappointed but if you have any ounce of joy in your body and can tolerate Reynold's style of acting/dry comedy (which granted isn't for everyone) you'll have a great time.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
366,rsjovertoom,"You shouldn't need a review, but here it is",6,23 July 2021,"Why are you checking reviews for this one? Are you really that thorough? You know what you're going to get, and I don't think you'd come back after the movie wanting to know what everybody else thinks of it. It's not that memorable.Anyway, let's get into it. This movie is exactly what you expect it to be. Stupid over the top plot with a silly villain who needs to be stopped by Reynolds, Jackson and this time around Hayek as well. It's a silly flick that focuses on banter between the leads.Pro's: the banter's still fun. Reynolds and Jackson were awesome in the first one, and Hayek does not disappoint as she joins the verbal fireworks this time around. There's some cool action too.Con's: Uh.. yeah the movie's kinda bad otherwise. Worse than the first one, which was quite bad to begin with.Go watch this for the dialogue, not for plot, character, setting or any of that storytelling stuf. The actors are having fun, but the movie doesn't give us much else.For these kinds of movies I always feel like I have to give them a bad grade because there's too much stuff that's just not good. So I ask myself: did I enjoy myself while watching it? Or did I find myself wanting to leave? No. I had a fun time.

There is ostensibly little to complain about in the sequel, beginning with the script, which probably looked good on paper. The movie is well-shot, the pace is good, the acting passable. There are a few smiles to be had. But the film falls flat for doing nothing more than going through the motions. The utter lack of character development (unlike the 1st film) and lack of emotional involvement in the characters (as a viewer) are critical to this being an unrewarding experience.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

377,lizziemariejb,Better than most are giving it credit for... 7.5/10 (rounded-up generously for balance),9,5 July 2021,"I had an absolute BLAST at the theater with this movie. Was it the love of the cinema experience and my delight at returning to the theater after all this time? Perhaps. Was it experiencing it with my 16-yr-old son and the HUGE laughs we shared and the joy of finding something we both can enjoy together? Perhaps! Is it my somewhat inexplicable love of movies that do action or spy stories with deep satire and ridiculousness like the Kingsman franchise? Perhaps.But no two ways about it, I truly enjoyed this movie. The first one was okay, but didn't make an impression on me. I think they kicked everything about the first into overdrive, and the more ridiculous and over the top tone actually helped make it better. We aren't supposed to think it's realistic! Leaning into a farcical plot and villain, action and jokes; it made more room for enjoyment.It's a great return to the theater: loud, fast paced, truly funny, and HUGE stars. So dumb it's funny, but not in way so many ""comedy"" films end up being. If you have a teen son, take him and have a blast like we did. If you're looking for an easy fun time at the movies? Go for it. Surprisingly I recommend this movie, even if you didn't love the first one. It's better.And by the way, not ALL critics killed this one in their reviews. I just noticed the roger ebert critic gave it 3 out of 4 stars. It's nice to see a professional reviewer give something like this a chance for once! I agree with her rating 3/4 or a 7.5/10.

I've been hurt by sequels before.This film is hilarious. It inherits the same comedic timing and gripping action sequences the previous film had. There is less back and forth between Reynolds and Jackson, which is a big reason the first film was so good, but Salma fills in the gaps beautifully.In the first film I wanted more of Salma's character, who is over the top in a believable and funny way. We got a lot more of her in this film (as the title told us we would) and I am so glad that we did.Her performance was impeccable.This film is worth your time, and even worth re-watching.

Directors need to take a look at the old classics and see how its done. Take Heat for example, totally realistic and exiting to watch rather than this rubbish they keep throwing our way.One could say yes but it is intended for younger audiences but Salma Hayek's lines if you can call them that scuppers that line of reasoning. Did she get paid per profanity?So the movie is not really fit for younger audiences thanks to the poor dialogue which seemed like a contest to see how many times the F and C words could be fitted into a scene.The Action scenes were not worth watching if you are over eighteen and have at least some critical thinking ability.So I guess the movie was aimed at people who just want some background noise and flashing lights while they drift off into a coma.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

Samuel L Jackson has had the same for decades. Hard not to enjoy it as he seems to be. Salma Hayek is the reason you go and watch. Obviously. Antonio Banderas is miscast as the villain. Forget the plot is what I do in most of these types of films so I don't mark this film down for this insane one.With so many bullets flying and so much abuse these ""heroes"" take its just too hard to watch them bounce right back up and go on like nothing happened. It's not necessary for Reynolds to be hit by cars and shotguns etc.I was hoping for something new. Something unexpected. I didn't get it. As I said, it's worth $2 for sure.

Hayek really shone as an action star and I am pleased to announce that my money wasn't wasted to see this, especially given the legacy of its predecessor, The Hitman's Bodyguard.My lone issue, beyond the plot, was that it was almost nonstop action from the beginning to the end. The audience needs at least one breather.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard
428,ray512122,Don't waste your time,1,22 July 2021,I enjoyed the first movie. Wasn't the best comedy but it was entertaining. The sequel took a nose dive. I am not a prude but I couldn't understand the amount of swearing by Hayek's character. It was cringey and sounded more like a kid who is trying to be cool by cursing. The story was all over the place and they really dumbed down Reynold's character. I can't give a full review of the movie because I wasn't able to stomach watching the whole thing.,Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

But guess what, it's a FICTIONAL action comedy.I loved SLJ, Reynolds, and Hayek together.Hayek brought the extra special touch of being one crazy bitc*.

If you enjoyed the first one, give this one a shot, because it has the humor your probably looking for. But it is just so scrapped together and awful. The story is just so bad and almost ruins the somewhat franchise that they could have had. They completely wasted the potential this sequel could have.

The only people who think this isn't funny are people who are looking for an action only movie and are disappointed by humor. I saw people complaining about A-listers running around acting stupid. And maybe people with a low IQ who don't understand the jokes. It is a little slapstick, but personally, that's what I enjoy. Ryan Reynolds rarely appears in movies that aren't hilarious or have humorous undertones, so watch another movie. I enjoyed it!",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

There should have been a big reveal by the end,something more ,and better. The movie has potential, it can be good and really good in the future if the creators take a different approach to it, I'm not saying I know better than the creators ,I think the people who watch the end product can always have something new to share based on their experiences,just an observation.

Unfortunately found the comedy in this one less funny, mainly due to recycled jokes (most others feel forced) and, as much as I loved her in the first one, Salma Hayek (or rather her accent) , which, due to its thickness, you have trouble understanding so most of her jokes fall flat. Also she talks so fast at times its grating after a while. I think less is more when it comes to her character. I would've preferred to see more of Elodie Yung as Amelia from the last film, but nothing is mentioned of her at all. All in all they tried too hard to make it as funny as the first one but I guess they couldn't think of any original jokes to keep it fresh. Shame as this could've been as good as the first with a bit more thought. I rate it a 7 for the stellar cast alone.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

So what does she do...... Salma walks around in her bra and shoots the bad guys by yelling. Yes readers, That's her special move YELLING.Michael in this movie looks like the guy who is suffering from every disease known to man( and probably some undiscovered ones too).Let's talk about the hitman Darius, all he does in this movie is do some ugly kissing with Salma and talk about his broken nuts.The side cast which includes Morgan Freeman, Grillo, Banderas( the main Villain) makes you feel like a one-dollar bill in a Ferrari showroom.So the question arises why did they make it...

The film feels like they weren't sure what could be the bad guy so they but a vague computer virus that was somehow transmitted by a drill bit because you know drilling and hacking are the same thing (?) It made fun of itself like the Expendables but didn't have the whole idea of being a cheeky play on aging characters going for it, the first one had a point this one was aimless and sloppy with painful jokes, if you like the hitmans bodyguard skip this one it kind of ruins it retroactively.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

Morgan Freeman's character is totally wasted, could have been a jewel of a role but alas it is not to be... where are the screen writers these days? And Antonio Banderas as a Greek super villain?The plot is a very basic ""save the world"", ""save Europe"" trope with very little beyond that. It has some over the top, gross, rated R stuff tossed in with some action it that seemed a bit forced but overall okay. It is a comedy with some stupid but fairly good laughs and Salma Hayek looks amazing as the eye candy. There is still some chemistry between Ryan Reynolds and Samuel Jackson so I was very happy to waste the time watching it.

539,SamMoviesHD,"Good, but meh....",6,19 June 2021,"Explosions. There were a lot of bloody explosions. Very, very action packed movie, involving a lot of fight scenes and many shooty shooty bits too. Let's start with the characters. The main ""baddie"" is ""Darius Kincaid"" who is played by Samuel L Jackson. Personally, I am a big fan of Samuel L Jackson, but I couldn't help feeling that the directors did not manage to get his full potential out in this movie. There were a couple funny jokes here and there, but overall just a bit lackluster for my liking. His wife, ""Sonia Kincaid'', who was played by Salma Hayek was his ""partner in crime"" and they did all their crime together. I really enjoyed Salma's performance and I feel like she was the best character. The ""hero"" in this movie, played by Ryan Reynolds, is ""Michael Bryce"". I really enjoyed Ryan's performance, but I can't help but think that the producers really could have done more with what they had. The character is portrayed to be dopy and not the brightest bulb in the room, but this does make you wonder about other pieces of this story adding up. Overall, the main characters have been played very well by these actors, but I do feel like we don't really get to know them that well and over the time of the movie these characters feel very stagnant.Talking about the villain duo, I can't help but wonder what they have done that is so bad to make them the villains. Apart from the first 5/10 minutes of the movie, the only ""evil"" thing they have done is kill many people with absolutely no consequences. I get that this is a movie, but it feels very far-fetched and away from reality. The two are crazy in love, killing everyone and everything that gets in their way, no matter how unnecessary it is. When looking at the three as a trio, you can feel a sort of bond forming throughout the movie, but it doesn't progress as much as I would like it to. They go from absolutely hating each other to then being good friends and I struggle to see a good reason for this? Maybe I need to watch the movie again to try and see why but from the first run through it left me a little bit baffled. Michael Bryce gave off a very ""socially awkward"" feel and couldn't help but find myself feeling a bit confused. It shows him as a multi award winning bodyguard, but there were very few points throughout this movie that proved he was a competent one at that (apart from his impressive ability to never miss a shot).Just like the majority of Hollywood movies, the shooting aim of the ""other"" characters is completely useless and they would not be able to hit a barn door. Whereas our main characters seem to be the best weapon wielders anyone has ever seen, multiple times out gunning several enemies who are armed with machine guns whilst they just shoot with their pistols. As I said at the beginning, their was a stupid amount of explosions, shooting, and fight scenes. There was some points throughout the movie that struggled to see what was going on as the camera's were shaking so much. I know that they are trying to give off an effect by doing that, but it just felt overwhelming at points. With this cast, I would have liked to see more comedy being thrown into the movie as it felt 70% pew pew and 30% hahaha. When the jokes did come around, they felt very forced and I found very few worth a laugh. There were points in the movie that could have been completely cut out, as all it was there to do was set up a joke.The movie felt like it dragged, and there were points of it where I was physically bored and nearly dozed off. Everything felt rushed, we never got introduced to any of the other characters properly, and the story line was so predictable. I wasn't able to build a connection with any of the characters and just as I was getting to know one, another came walking through the door. I enjoyed aspects of the movie, but it isn't one that I will be watching again anytime soon. I would overall give this a 6/10, as I feel the cast's acting saved it somewhat from being a complete snorefest.(ps. I have not seen the prequel, so I am reviewing this movie as a one off)",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

It took me about 15 minutes into the movie to start yelling at the screen why are you even still in this movie. Kill him off writers or whatever.The acting was great all around him. In fact his parts actually for me (Yes just my opinion) made the acting of others around him fall down kind of like if you are acting like you are in Alaska and some guy comes in with a surfboard and says surfs up.Do not get me wrong though. This is actually a very good movie with really big names. Not worth the $50 (Ticket, Travel, Food, Etcetera.

552,bufferoverflow-96310,Had no idea there was a first one,10,26 July 2021,"I have watched this movie twice already and I can say it is going to be one of my all time favorites. Reading other reviews I found out there is a first movie in the series and I am ordering it. I had no idea!The movie is an incredible representation of how movies like John Wick have just become completely fake. In fact they directly allude to John Wick when they pass through a tunnel fighting bad guys, and there are weapons placed conveniently along their path so they can fight non stop.The entire time they are fighting, they have casual conversation, and they are also aware that they cannot die. Reynold's character at one point stands up in front of a hit squad, they all fire directly at him while missing, and he screams, ""Bullet's are allergic to me!"" This was a defining moment. It showed that what we are watching is actually a representation of good vs. Bad and not meant to be actually possible.This is shown again later, when Antonio Banderas' character comes out with his huge gun pumping rounds all over, and does slight damage to the leg of a good guy. Obviously in real life this is not what would have happened, when a man is firing an M249 into a room. But it simply represents: the bad guy is coming out now in style, and doing damage to a good guy for the first time in the movie.The end of the movie was also incredibly satisfying, when Hayek thanks the Mother Mary, I think in real life she would have thanked ""Dios"", (God in spanish) but they probably didn't want to make her statement too controversial so it was toned down.Hayek is 54 years old, probably not getting pregnant any time soon, so the entire premise of the movie I think is assumed to be tongue in cheek. The movie is hilarious. I had to pause many times because I was laughing too much and didn't want to miss it. Honestly I am shocked they got this entire cast together, MORGAN FREEMAN, I mean oh my gosh.I learned a lot of life lessons from this movie, and I look forward to seeing it again. I believe everyone played their part very well, and you would be hard pressed to find a better movie than this.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

560,cakicchuck,Devil's in the details,3,25 August 2021,"Right off the bat, as the plot thickens, there are some really peculiar or rather dubious effects of destruction in ""Zagreb"".CGI could've been more convincing and the location accuracy could've been more consistent e.g. Zagreb DOES NOT have an underground railway system and the license plates used on the cars in the aftermath of ""Zagreb demonstration"" are Italian which is hilarious since Zagreb is in CROATIA.Throughout the movie, there are various inconsistencies e.g. Car chase in Firenze where traffic signs are in Croatian language so as the ""pizza/sandwich bar"". Then, the safehouse ""map"" showing a dot where real Firenze approximately is, all the way to Istria followed by words ""You just take this road...."" as if it was around the bend, instead of more than 400km (or 300 miles)...
I'd dare to say that action scenes are a little.....overboard. (pun intended - for those who have seen or are about to see the movie).All in all - it's a fun movie to watch, legendary cast, but once is enough.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

Awesome action scenes from beginning to end, with the perfect amount of comedy and inside jokes of the actors in real life. They even mention their ages and use that as something more to build jokes upon.I had to write this review because I could not believe what others are saying about this movie, including there is ""too much gore"". In the title you have a pretty good hint... HITMAN, and BODYGUARD, what about those two words make you think there's no blood? In the cast Samuel Jackson ""as himself"" and Ryan Reynolds. What makes you think there's going to be no swearing??Them, along with Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas made a bang up job in this movie that does not take itself too seriously and the whole point of it is to entertain the audience.

Reynolds and Jackson are as good as they always are, Hayek really leans into the over-the-top role of Mrs. Kincaid, and the action is again superb. The story is ok at best with characters making decisions that don't make sense, and plot points that feel like lazy storytelling. With all that said, it's far better that the worst sequels (see Ghostbusters II, The Phantom Menace) but doesn't hit the level of the best sequels (see The Empire Strikes Back, Thor: Ragnarok).

588,adj-410,A movie that you'd enjoy if you're 12 yo.,3,16 July 2021,"I'm a fan of the first movie, it was nicely acted and directed and the harmony between the two protagonists was funny to watch and Laughable to some extent. The plot was predictable yet it exhibited a smoothly written action-comedy storyline.This one, however, just reminded me of that time I was 10 years old and been introduced to Hollywood movies that, as far as I can remember, got me thrilled with their excessive action shots, saving the world plot, normal people that are super heroes, and an antagonist with a weird plan to dominate earth that appears to be perfect. I liked these kind of movies because they were cartoon based storylines, just good guys fighting bad guys, nothing much, no depth intended, it was ok for me to see cars getting explode for no reason, and people die for no reason too! At that time, whenever a movie finishes, I imagine myself to be the hero, the perfect spy, etc. I was a child with big dreams.Today, in my mid twenties, I've decided to watch what I thought would be a nice sequel, a movie that would respect its audience intelligence with a well written plot, or deliver some sort of a message, a meaningful thought, an idea, or well constructed dialogue, that I might not find a total waste of my time, or at least makes me laugh, draw a smile of my face, or follows a logical story development, or characters build... Nothing!I'm really not the biggest fan of things happening for no reason, I find these kind of movies dull and boring, despite the severe action shots used, this movie didn't deliver anything, it was a complete waste, waste of time, and waste of resources, yes I enjoyed the acting of three protagonists, despite of course the plethora of swear words that they thought would be a realistic addition to their performance, however besides that performance, this movie has nothing to offer, really.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

590,PhreshW0rl,The sequel was mediocre but is usually expected for comedy movies!!,5,21 June 2021,"The first installment of ""The Hitman's Bodyguard"" released back in 2017 was an excellent duo for two of Hollywood's charismatic and comedic actors. I did not re-watch the first movie to prepare for the sequel but you it's not viral to watch the first because the sequel is not concise with a plot.Hitman's Bodyguard Wife plot is wrapped around Micheal Bryce(Ryan Reynolds) being on a sabbatical from his lifestyle as a bodyguard. The sabbatical is abruptly interrupted by Con woman Sonia Kincade(Salma Hayek) to save her Husband Darius Kincade(Samuel L Jackson) from death and save Europe from a corrupt rich man Aristole(Antonio Banderas).The movie creates another comedic action film but has too many coerced scenes that feel like a Michael Bay film. The comedy aspect is way too cheesy and typical from what you get from other films from past time. The action scenes honestly override the fulfillment of the film because the gore and stunts made for the film. In all honesty, if you like the current direction of the F&F films since it stop being wrapped around street racing then you'll love this film.I gave this movie a lower score (5 out of 10) than the overall consensus (6.5 out of 10) because I did have high expectations on it being at least decent (which it did not live up to) but it was just too mediocre to agree with the critics. It definitely has a good line of A list actors which also include Morgan Freeman and Frank Grillo but at this point in my adult like the impression on who they cast for a film is not near as important as making an intriguing movie that doesn't feel like I'm playing a game of Jenga.",Hitman's Wife's Bodyguard

We really enjoyed it and so did the busy cinema, there was laughter from start to finish.

I don't feel like Ryan Reynolds' character even seemed like the same character from the first movie. There was no growth for him after the first movie and it wasn't very funny. Salma Hayek's swearing seemed a little forced too. It seems to come naturally for Sam Jackson, but didn't work the same for her.

Especially when Frank Grillo (who I loved in Boss Level by the way) was introduced to Alice McMillan, who's character was named 'Ailso' and Frank couldn't pronounce it and started calling her 'as**ole', I laughed so hard.Plus i loved the violence, gunfire, chases, foul mouth remarks and the comedy. And the CGI was not too bad.The only 3 problems i had, well 2 and a half actually, were (starting with the half) that the plot line was silly. Come on, I mean destroy one data box with a giant diamond drill bit and push a bomb in and bye bye EU. I am sure they have backup data Junction boxes elsewhere. But i guess for the movie to fun the plot has to be slightly silly, that's why i gave a half for this.No 2 is what the heck is Salma saying, the Latino accent is hard enough to understand, but with her enunciating even the profanity . I only got what she said about 2 seconds after she said it.And no 3, the green screen pics when driving were really bad, especially the one where all three main characters were in Bryce's dad's Jag.Other than that, it was one hell of a ride.
