0,SnoopyStyle,a fine ride,6,4 August 2021,"For 400 years, men have been searching the Amazon to find the Tears of the Moon, the flower petals of a legendary tree which can cures any illness or curse. It's 1916 London. Siblings Lily (Emily Blunt) and MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) steal an arrowhead artifact from the Royal Society. It's the key to finding the tree. They are pursued by the ruthless Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons). They hire a boat skippered by Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson). Joachim reawakens cursed Spanish conquistadors led by Aguirre (Edgar Ramírez).As an action adventure, this is fairly good. It's trying to be The African Queen with a healthy dose of Pirates of the Caribbean. It's not as good as either. The chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt is pretty good but it's strictly platonic. They have no romantic heat. It's the fun banter of kidding best friends. Anyone watching them interact in real life would notice their natural chemistry. It's a basic chemistry test mistake. Quite honestly, I would be more than happy to have these two turn into adventure best buddies. Maybe they could find the romantic chemistry eventually in the later movies but they don't have it in this one. I like Paul Giamatti and am disappointed that he doesn't follow them up the river. Jesse Plemons is going full cartoon in his villain acting but maybe somebody else could do it better. Still, it's a fun ride while it lasted.",Jungle Cruise
1,Prismark10,Jungle Cruise,6,8 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise is an adaptation of a Disney Park ride that I can barely remember going to and I have been to both Disney parks in the USA.It also has five writers with various screenplay credits.Dwayne Johnson plays Frank. A down on his luck river boat captain who takes tourists for a ride in the Amazon.He is hired by adventurer Lily (Emily Blunt) and her uptight brother MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) who are on the search for the Tears of the Moon. The petals of a tree of life that can cure any illness. The Spanish were in search for it about 400 years earlier.Set in 1916, Lily finds that German Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) is also in pursuit at a time when the nations are at war. However Lily finds that Frank is a man who is hard to trust and he is full of cheesy jokes.This comedy adventure is a mish mash of previous movies. I found it more Romancing the Stone mixed with the Brendan Fraser The Mummy movies. There is also a hint of the Pirate of the Caribbean franchise.It harks back to two decades earlier when Disney were adapting their theme park rides rather than superhero movies or remaking their old cartoons as live action films.Jungle Cruise is a colourful romp that lacks originality.",Jungle Cruise
2,nogodnomasters,I can't turn it off,8,16 September 2021,"Text: Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) steals an arrowhead from the British archives and absconds to the Amazon with her English snob brother (Jack Whitehall). They are in search of the legendary ""Tears of the Moon"" which she believes will cure disease. They need to charter a boat and they end up with Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) a showman, conman, and punster.Based on a Disney Ride the film is a blend of ""The African Queen"" and ""Medicine Man"" in the shadow of Colonel Fawcett. There are plenty of snakes in the film that begs the question, ""Why can't Paul Giamatti do a convincing Italian accent?""Guide: Disney film.

3,lee_eisenberg,old-style ride updated for the 21st century,5,4 August 2021,"I had never heard of the Jungle Cruise ride until I heard of this movie, and that Disneyland was removing racist caricatures from the ride (well, they kinda have to at this point).As for the movie ""Jungle Cruise"", it was what I expected. Lots of action reminiscent of every adventure movie of the past forty years, and no shortage of CGI. Very much a summer movie. Sure to entertain the tykes.",Jungle Cruise
4,jboothmillard,Jungle Cruise,7,10 August 2021,"Just like Pirates of the Caribbean, this started life as a Disney World attraction before becoming a feature film, it was delayed from release for a whole year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but when it did come out, I was hoping it would be a good ride, directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (House of Wax, Orphan, The Shallows). Basically, in 1556, in South America there is a search by Spanish conquistadors (knights) to find the Tears of the Moon, a mythical tree whose flowers cure illness, heal injuries, and lift curses. Don Aguirre (Edgar Ramírez) stabs the tribal chief for refusing to reveal the tree's location and destroys the village. The dying chief (Pedro Lopez) curses the conquistadors, making them immortal and unable to leave the Amazon River for all eternity. In 1916 London, Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) has been researching the Tears of the Moon, and her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) presents it to the Royal Society, claiming that the tree's flowers could revolutionise medicine and help the British war effort. The Houghtons request access to a recently acquired arrowhead artifact. Lily believes it and an old map are key to finding the tree. But the society deny the request, believing the tree to be a myth and female scientists to be inferior. Lily steals the arrowhead, narrowly evading German royal Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) seeking the tree to help the Germans win the war. In Brazil, Lily and MacGregor need a boat and a guide to lead them down the Amazon. Frank Wolff (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) is a riverboat skipper who offers cut-rate jungle cruises embellished with faked dangers and corny puns. Lily goes to find businessman and harbourmaster Nilo Nemolato (Paul Giamatti). Frank has snuck into his office to steal the keys to his boat back. Frank poses as Nilo and learns of her quest to find the tree, but declines her offer, believing it too dangerous, but reconsiders upon seeing the arrowhead. The real Nilo reveals himself, and Lily is unhappy with Frank's trickery, but accepts his offer after he saves them from a jaguar attack, although the jaguar is revealed to be his pet, Proxima. Frank steals back his repossessed boat engine, and he and the Houghtons depart. Joachim attacks the group in a German submarine, but they manage to escape and journey downriver. Inside Frank's cabin, Lily notices photos and sketches of modern inventions, as well as maps, drawings, and research on the Tears of the Moon. She realises Frank has been seeking the tree, but he insists he gave up a long time ago. A ""cannibal"" tribe captures the group, but this is another one of Frank's schemes, which he claims he was unable to call off in time. Lily is furious and doubts he is trustworthy. The tribal leader Trader Sam (Veronica Falcón) translates the symbols on the arrowhead, revealing the tree's location and that it only blooms under a blood moon. Meanwhile, Joachim locates the conquistadors turned to stone inside a cave and frees them using water from the river. They consist of Sancho (Dani Rovira), covered in honey and bees, Melchor (Quim Gutiérrez), covered in tree roots and branches, and Gonzalo (Dan Dargan Carter), made of mud. Joachim offers to lift their curse if they retrieve the arrowhead. The Spaniards attack the tribe and fatally stab Frank while Lily flees with the arrowhead. As she crosses the curse's boundary, the pursuing Spaniards are dragged back into the jungle by vines. To the Houghtons' shock, Frank has survived; his real name is Francisco, he is one of the conquistadors on a noble quest to save Aguirre's gravely ill daughter. When the Spaniards attacked the natives, Frank defended the village. Frank trapped the conquistadors in the cave where they turned to stone, and he spent centuries searching for the tree to lift his own curse. While Joachim has captured MacGregor, Lily and Frank go on alone. Following the arrowhead instructions, they find a waterfall, and activate a submerged stone structure to lower the water level and reveal a passageway. Joachim and the Germans catch up to them and follow Lily and Frank, along with MacGregor and the Spaniards to find the tree. They learn the arrowhead is a heart-shaped locket containing a gemstone. Placing the gem into the trunk of the dormant tree causes it to bloom under the blood moon. The light of the moon begins to pass, but Lily manages to grab a single flower from the tree before the bloom ends. A fight ensues, with MacGregor killing Joachim, while Frank crashes his boat to block the river, turning himself and the Spaniards into stone. Lily, realising she has feelings for Frank, sacrifices the flower to release him from the stone, lifting his curse and restoring his mortality. Frank, who intended to end his life, decides to continue living to be with Lily. The moon casts one last beam of light, blooming a single flower and allowing Lily's research to proceed. Returning to England, the Royal Society offers Lily full membership, but she rejects, showing Frank around London and teaching him to drive an automobile. Also starring Andy Nyman as Sir James Hobbs-Coddington, and Raphael Alejandro as Zaqueu. Johnson is a likeable rugged hero, Blunt is good as the prim-and-proper scientist, comedian Whitehall is good comic relief, and Plemons with his dodgy German accent is an amusing pantomime villain. As you would expect this is a mission movie full of obstacles and dangers, from raging rivers to fierce creatures, the special effects are terrific, and the comedy is added at the right moments, it is a fun fantasy adventure. Very good!",Jungle Cruise
5,BA_Harrison,Jungle Crud,2,24 September 2021,"I love jungle adventure films, and I like Dwayne Johnson, but Disney's Jungle Cruise is a perilous journey into mega-budget awfulness, director Jaume Collet-Serra unsuccessfully steering this wreck of a movie into turbulent waters with a messy script that lurches awkwardly from one CGI-drenched scene to another.'The Rock' plays riverboat captain Frank Wolff, who is hired by well-meaning scientist Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) to take her and her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) on an expedition into the most uncharted regions of the Amazon in search for the tree of life, the petals of which can cure all known ailments. This being a Raiders of the Lost Ark style adventure, the tree is also of interest to a group of nasty Germans, led by Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons), who has less altruistic reasons for finding the life-giving plant.Lovable rogue Frank steers his CGI boat down the CGI river, while Lily marvels at the CGI animals that inhabit the region, all the while pursued by Joachim in his CGI submarine. After successfully navigating CGI raging rapids and a CGI waterfall, the adventurers discover an ancient underwater mechanism that drains an entire river bed (frightfully clever chaps, these Amazonian engineers), revealing the CGI tree to our intrepid explorers. Unfortunately, Joachim has several supernatural CGI conquistadors on his side, who cause problems for our heroes and heroine.The terrible too-many-cooks screenplay, by no less than seven writers, makes very little sense at times: no explanation is given for how Joachim knows how to locate and reanimate the ancient Spanish conquistadors, each of whom has their own inexplicable superpower. Even more perplexing is the revivification of the tree by Lily, who mumbles some unintelligible nonsense, before snapping open her precious stone arrowhead to reveal a sachet of Miracle-Gro (or something like that-I really wasn't sure).With its muddled plot and overuse of digital trickery, Jungle Cruise is a frustratingly lacklustre ride, but perhaps the film's biggest failure is to never genuinely excite the audience: with his Indiana Jones movies, Spielberg frequently put the hero in palpably perilous situations that kept the viewer on the edge of their seat; it's hard to feel thrilled and exhilarated when Jungle Cruise's characters are engaging in witty banter while supposedly facing mortal danger.2.5/10, rounded down to 2 for the CGI dolphins, the CGI frogs, the CGI snakes, the CGI tarantula, the CGI toucans, and for Proxima, Frank's pet CGI jaguar.",Jungle Cruise
6,paul_haakonsen,Good old fashioned adventure for the entire family...,7,31 July 2021,"Well, the 2021 adventure movie ""Jungle Cruise"" is a definite must watch movie if you enjoy movies that have Dwayne Johnson in it.I sat down to watch this 2021 Disney movie with a certain amount of expectations to it, since it was both a Disney movie, but also had Dwayne Johnson on the cast list. I think he is very well-cut, pardon the pun, for the adventure movie genre.And he doesn't disappoint in ""Jungle Cruise"", let me just say that right away. Yup, he is so well-cast for this movie and really carries it phenomenally with his performance and that particular character.The storyline told in ""Jungle Cruise"", as written by Michael Green, Glenn Ficarra, John Requa, John Norville, Josh Goldstein and Glenn Ficarra definitely was a very entertaining one. And it was the type of storyline that quickly picks you up from the very beginning and takes you along with it for quite the thrill ride throughout the jungle. I was expecting it to be good, but I must admit that the story actually turned out to be way more interesting and detailed than I had anticipated.Visually then ""Jungle Cruise"" is just spectacular. The jungle really offers a lot to look at, and just makes for a grand setting for the movie. But also things like the wardrobe, props, etc. Were really spot on and very detailed, adding a lot to the movie.The CGI in the movie was good, but of course with this being Disney, why wouldn't it be? And the jaguar pet really was a nice touch to the movie.""Jungle Cruise"" definitely has a good cast. Of course
Dwayne Johnson is the main attraction and he carries the movie so wonderfully. I wasn't initially thrilled about it being Emily Blunt to co-star alongside
Dwayne Johnson, but she really put on a great performance and I liked her in this movie. It was really nice to see Paul Giamatti in the movie, and he had a wonderful character here, just a shame that he wasn't given more on-screen time.If you get the chance to watch director Jaume Collet-Serra's ""Jungle Cruise"", you must do so. Especially if you enjoy family movies and adventure movies. So if you enjoyed movies like ""The Goonies"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""Journey 2: The Mysterious Island"", etc. Then you most certainly will also enjoy ""Jungle Cruise"".This is a movie that I can warmly recommend you sit down to watch.I am rating ""Jungle Cruise"" a well-deserved seven out of ten stars.",Jungle Cruise
7,tavm,Jungle Cruise was pretty enjoyable for what it was,7,13 August 2021,"Partly inspired by Raiders of the Lost Ark and The African Queen as well as the Disney Parks' famous ride this movie is named after, Jungle Cruise is way too much exposition though things are kept hopping during most of its running time. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt (along with the person playing the latter's brother) take us on a mostly enjoyable ride to whatever they're looking for. My movie theatre-working friend enjoyed this much more than I did but I liked it fine for what it was. Some of the most enjoyable parts were Johnson's corny puns. So that's a partial recommendation of Jungle Cruise.",Jungle Cruise
8,studioAT,Jungle Cruise,3,22 October 2021,"Take a likeable pairing of Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, throw in a plot that seems to be part Jumanji and part Pirates of the Caribbean and put it together under the heading of Jungle Cruise.That seems to be the thinking behind this film based on another Disneyland ride (I can't wait for the 'It's a Small World' film...).It's fine, it's enjoyable enough, but goes on far too long, and the endless verbal sparring between the leads (not to mention the obsession with Emily Blunt's character being in trousers) grows a bit tiresome over time.Fine enough, but I wouldn't rush to see it again.",Jungle Cruise
9,CinemaSerf,"Solid, if unremarkable, Disney fayre...",6,15 September 2021,"A bit like Chris Pratt, I like Dwayne Johnson. He's an out and out entertainer - there is nothing complicated about his presentation, and here is no different. This is just a family adventure film that sees him taking his clients ""Lily"" (Emily Blunt) and her posh brother ""MacGregor"" (Jack Whitehall) on a search to find a tree with leaves that might have amazing recuperative powers that could eradicate illness. Along the way, they have to battle a jungle brimming with hungry beasties and with some recently revived ancient conquistadors who have an agenda all of their own. The visual effects are as you'd expect from Disney and as far as it goes this is a perfectly acceptable, lightweight piece of cinema. It's derivative, certainly - it has shades of ""The Mummy"" (1999) to the storyline alongside a bit of ""Dead Man's Chest"" (2006) with Whitehall reminding me a lot of the John Hannah character from the former, but it still moves along apace and though hardly taxing for the adults, it ought to keep the young ones entertained for what did seem a slightly over long 2hrs-odd.",Jungle Cruise
10,Calicodreamin,Charming,7,4 August 2021,"A darling cast and a unique storyline make Jungle Cruise a charming movie. There are a few flaws and it's definitely a bit long. But, it's visually spectacular, had a good mix of humor and action, and leading lady Emily Blunt has never been better. A wonderful movie experience.",Jungle Cruise
11,neil-476,Decent family action adventure,7,8 August 2021,"As World War II gets under way, siblings Lily and MacGregor Houghton steal an Amazonian arrowhead which is apparently the key to finding a fabled blossom with is a miracle cure-all. This brings them to the ramshackle river steamer belonging to rogueish skipper and serial liar Frank, and the adventure is under way.Disney turns another theme park ride into a movie, aided by heavy influences from the ride itself, the Pirates franchise, Indiana Jones, and The African Queen. This leads to the most obvious criticism of the movie: it is very obviously assembled from bits and pieces from elsewhere, and doesn't easily forge its own identity.Dwayne Johnson's Frank is the likeable hunk character which he can do in his sleep, and Emily Blunt is generic feisty, somewhat ahead of her time proto-feminist with annoying contradictory traits of imaginative resourcefulness and determination coupled with naivete. Only Jack Whitehall goes beyond cardboard cutout. His effete MacGregor is by far the funniest character in the film and actually has a credible character development arc.The action, effects and spectacle are fine. Many of the shots seem desighed for 3D presentation. There is a plot twist halfway through, a good one which I didn't see coming.This is an enjoyable, undemanding popcorn movie.",Jungle Cruise
12,FlashCallahan,Slowly runs out of steam.........,7,4 August 2021,"When this was first announced, I had little or no expectations for the film. After all, the success rate of Disney rides turned into movies was very average.But after reading some of the reviews stating that it was an adventure movie that could hold up next to Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park. My expectations then went nuclear, and it also had the element of 3D, which I have a weakness for.Johnson and Blunt are wonderful onscreen, bouncing off each other and having wonderful chemistry, which takes away the fundamental problems of the film.The first act is amazing, introducing our main characters with wit and lively action to complement each of them. If it stayed like this for the majority of the film, it could have easily been one of the funniest adventure films I've seen in a long time.However, as soon as the titular adventure is underway, we have more time with Jack Whitehall, who, in all fairness, is a fine actor, but his motivation here must have been him emulating John Hannah in the 'Mummy' movies, and the film also slips from Indiana Jones, to the Mummy franchise. It becomes more fantastical in its narrative, rather than staying with the grounded adventure it promised in the first act.Then, it falls into the POTC, with some twists that you can see coming from a mile off, and if you remember the twist in 'The Curse Of The Black Pearl', they just use that here.Throw in a stereotypical villain and henchman, then you get this film, which is playing it safe all the way through.So, although it's not by any means terrible, but it could have been so much more.",Jungle Cruise
13,deloudelouvain,Nice easy to watch adventure movie.,7,26 October 2021,"If you like adventure movies like Indiana Jones, Romancing The Stone, Jewel Of The Nile, Jumanji and others in this genre you can't go wrong with Jungle Cruise. It's the same entertainment, a bit over the top, not always making sense, but that's hardly the point with these kind of movies. It's just a bit of fun. To me it's very relaxing to watch these kind of popcorn movies. The Rock or Dwayne Johnson might not be the greatest actor but I think he fits in this genre. He's okay to watch in non serious movies. Emily Blunt did a good job as well as did the rest of the cast. The CGI's were more than decent, they clearly had a big budget for these parts in the movie. Jungle Cruise is perfect to watch as a family movie or if you're just a big fan of easy adventure.",Jungle Cruise
14,FeastMode,more shaky cam and quick cuts,5,5 August 2021,"I'm so sick of it. Shaky cam, quick cuts, close ups. I'm used to it in fight scenes in bad action movies. It recently sunk snake eyes for me. But this movie barely has fight scenes. It isn't martial arts. So why is it still being used? So many scenes were difficult to follow, especially the ones involving cgi.That's my main complaint. There were some stupid moments, and i started getting bored by the end. But i had a decent time and laughed a good amount. It's fairly entertaining with a serviceable story. But with the terribly filmed action and being bored during the climax, i can't give this a positive score (1 viewing, 8/4/2021)",Jungle Cruise
15,ThomasDrufke,The perfect combination of old school and modern filmmaking,9,22 October 2021,"It's hard to find a bigger fan of Emily Blunt than me, and as far as his movie career goes - same with The Rock. I've been looking forward to Jungle Cruise for years and seeing it this summer in theatres did not disappoint. I know it got hit hard with some critics but I found their chemistry to be electric and the whole aesthetic and feel to this film was unlike anything else theatres had to offer this year. Old school in style but has modern flare. I would love to see a sequel down the line.9.0/10.",Jungle Cruise

17,tabuno,An Above Average Fun Action Adventure,8,2 August 2021,"Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt headline this comedy, action, adventure thriller in what amounts to a rather entertaining summer movie. This action adventure appears to be a direct descendent of Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), The Mummy (1999); Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003), and National Treasure (2004). Somehow this movie version almost becomes a parody but does not and mostly succeeds in breaking a little new ground in its action sequences and storyline offering its audience more refreshing than expected experience. The animated big cat and several other special effects still have not quite established the maturity of the authenticity needed to completely win over skeptical audience members. And several places in the movie where there are an obvious attempts at live comedic staged reaction that almost fails and loses their timing and punch as well as offering up a few unbelievable staging and remarkable recovery scenes that defy reason to the point of almost breaking the movie fantasy this action adventure that has been casting its spell over the audience. Overall, Jungle Cruise is consistently enjoyable and a moderate breath of fresh air that makes a trip to the theater worthwhile.",Jungle Cruise
18,nairtejas,Enjoyable,7,1 August 2021,"I had a good time watching Jungle Cruise because the thrills just keep on coming.

19,UniqueParticle,Quite a pleasant time,9,30 July 2021,I absolutely love Jaume Collet Saura directed horror films many years ago and now does action/kid's movies. Emily Blunt is gorgeous and Dwane Johnson is always entertaining to watch in role in my role I appreciate all his work!

Love or hate this movie I highly recommend it!,Jungle Cruise
20,Thanos_Alfie,Interesting and funny...,6,21 September 2021,"""Jungle Cruise"" is an Adventure - Comedy movie in which we follow a small group of people on their riverboat cruise and their search of Lágrimas de Cristal Tree. They have to search for it and even face Don Aguirre who led the Spanish conquistadors to South America in 1556 for it.I liked this movie very much because the plot was very interesting and the interpretations of the cast were simply amazing. The movie became even better with some plot twists that I did not expect and some very clever details that were presented. The interpretations of both Emily Blunt who played as Lily Houghton and Dwayne Johnson who played as Frank Wolff were very good and their combination worked very well. The direction which was made by Jaume Collet-Serra it was also very good and he succeeded on creating a bond between his main characters and the audience.

22,eddie_baggins,No Pirates of the Caribbean but a fun family film regardless,6,2 August 2021,"A long time coming with various delays and Covid pandemic's stopping its planned 2020 release, 2021 finally sees Disney's latest theme park ride turned film Jungle Cruise make its way into the market courtesy of a hybrid cinema/Disney+ release, with this $200 million production a nice distraction if nothing more at this time and place.A hybrid of Indiana Jones/Romancing the Stone with a hearty dosage of The Mummy, that also wants desperately to give off the same vibes as the original Pirates of the Caribbean (still the gold standard when it comes to rides to film examples), director Jaume Collet-Serra takes a break from low-budget horror's and Liam Neeson thrillers to take Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt on an adventure filled quest to find a magic plant deep the Amazonian jungle circa the early 1900's in a journey that should entertain the whole family across its two hour runtime that barely pauses for breath from one event to the next.Jam-packed with questionable CGI that will make you long for the days where films were shot on location or at least real life locales rather than green screens at the back of a studio, Cruise is a colorful and energetic affair that does work far better than it had any right too thanks to its charismatic leads that generate nice moments off one another and a playful sense of adventure that is sometimes lost on modern day films taking a more po-faced approach to these type of affairs than necessary.Perhaps darker than one would except from the Jungle Cruise brand especially for a film with more puns than a season's worth of Friends, Cruise does nicely to steer away from a film that adults would struggle too sit through and some of Collet-Serra's action scenes such as an attack on a tribal village or a finale that is enlivened by the presence of comedic scene-stealer Jesse Plemon's make the film more than just a generic family affair, even if the film lacks any type of memorable performances like a Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow or an action scene/spectacle that would've made the film greater than it is.In some ways you wish someone or something managed to elevate the film too a higher level, there's moments in the film where opportunity seems to be arising for it too become a new Pirates level of popcorn entertainment or a very enjoyable Indiana Jones light rollicking adventure but as it stands Cruise is just an enjoyable and unassuming family film that is better than it should've been, but also not as good as it could've been.Final Say -A pleasant diversion for the whole family, Jungle Cruise provides a fun two hours in the Amazon (CGI) jungle with some likeable leads but it never does anything to make one think they will be remembering the film down the river at any time in the future.3 submarines out of 5.",Jungle Cruise
23,digitalbeachbum,Pirates of the Caribbean in the Amazon,1,31 July 2021,"Let's be completely honest with each other. Either you are a Disney nerd and everything they spit out is a golden turd or you are anti-crap and dislike when studios recycle, regurgitate the same CG, same script, same BS every few years. Like Disney does with its animated movies.I bet they used a lot of the same animation/CG that they did in the Pirates of the Caribbean. The scary Spaniards are exactly like them, complete copies in every respect. The story is also very similar to the Fountain of Youth from Pirates of the Caribbean. The surface has changed, but everything underneath the hood is the same.The casting is OK, the acting is childish, the script is meh. The movie is completely predictable. I became bored within a few moments, but tried to stay with it. The family enjoyed it. Silly, childish fun.I didn't care for it. I ended up stopping about half way.If you aren't looking for much in quality, then this might be your thing.",Jungle Cruise
24,SAMTHEBESTEST,As good as any Disney's Modern Fantasy Adventure Drama could get. An attempt to find those lost tools of entertainment from Indiana Jones and Pirates Of The Caribbean.,6,30 July 2021,"Jungle Cruise (2021) :
Movie Review -Disney seems to be doing fine now days with several remakes and adaptations. Those golden days of Disney won't come back now as they were ruling this Fantasy Adventure Genre like nobody else. One of the biggest attraction in this millenium was 'Pirates Of The Caribbean' (2003), and the entire series to some extent. The next films in this series couldn't match the first one and recently their last film in the franchise was way lower in terms of set standards. People aren't much happy with the news of POTC franchise being shelved forever and that new POTC Film with the female character in lead role had already been lashed out even before the first look release. Audience is missing such films now days and this new flick in Disney's amusing park - Jungle Cruise may please audience somewhat on a fair level, if not high. Jungle Cruise is entertaining and quite interesting with fantasy theories too but the most beautiful thing about the film is, it tries to use those old lost tools of Classic Films like Pirates Of The Caribbean and Indian Jones (first three films).It is based on Disneyland's theme park ride where a small riverboat takes a group of travelers through a jungle filled with dangerous animals and reptiles but with a supernatural element. This might remind of 'POTC : On Stranger Tides' and somewhat of Indiana Jones as well. It uses the same old tricks and even if it is too outdated, it still works because of new storyline. The problem is, all this is too mainstream and outdated for 2021, so naturally it becomes highly predictable. The only thing that keeps it interesting is the audience's interest over the same old fantasy adventure tales. There are few things which are just too annoying such as the love story, that's damn too boring and extremely common climax. Thankfully, the film does not drag much and remains steady overall to keep you on board.Dwayne Johnson plays an interesting character, Frank, something unimaginable but who cares when you are in Disney's fantasy park? So, he's quite enjoyable, something what Barbossa did for POTC in negative role, Frank does in positive way. Emily Blunt is rough and tough, very very lovable in almost every scene. Whether it is action, intelligence or tricks, her character has everything. Rest of the cast is okay, nothing much to added here. All the action scenes in the film are shot beautifully with the help of eye pleasing visual effects. Talking about the writing, it's nothing new but still reasonable and pretty complete. The screenplay could have been better though, especially is in the middle portion where it opens all the secrets and leaves nothing for the climax.Jaume Collet-Serra as the captain of the ship takes this cruise through pleasant Adventures. He might have forgot to add couple of twists and tricks which might have worked as surprise elements but it's not a big issue. Few quirky characters would have helped too but it's too much to ask for from Johnson and Blunt. Overall, a little flips here and there but the cruise finds its destination without any big blunders.

SPOILER SIDE NOTE: Excuse me, Mr. The Rock's character...I know you've been alive for 400 years, and you're ready to die, but if Emily Blunt asks you to go to London with her, then you go to London with Emily Blunt without hesitation...I'm sorry, but that's just the law.",Jungle Cruise
26,southdavid,Jungle is Massive !,5,2 August 2021,"I've been to both Disneyland and Disneyworld in my childhood and so must have ridden the Jungle Cruise ride... I have precisely zero memories of it though. Nevertheless, Disney have again transformed one of their rides into a movie, which is certainly no ""Haunted Mansion"" but it's no ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" either.Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) is an English explorer who believes firmly that, hidden in the Amazon basin, is the ""Tree of Life"", a rare plant whose leaves are an elixir for curing any ailment. Together with her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) they head to South America and procure Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) to transport them up the river. However, they are not the only people seeking the legend, Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) wants to use the bloom to turn the Great War in Germany's favour and a long dead Conquistador, Aguirre (Edgar Ramirez) may not have ceased his search just yet.Ultimately, I thought it was satisfactory. I liked our three main characters and I enjoyed Jesse Plemons turn as the unstable German Prince. Paul Giamatti has a nice cameo as the owner of the port where Frank recruits his tour patrons from. The action scenes are generally decent, particularly as the film gets going and the gang leave the port. The CGI work I didn't find to be particularly good though, especially in the scenes at night and involving Aguirre's gang. It doesn't undermine the whole movie, but those blurry visuals are one of the things I can remember about it, writing the review 48 hours later.The problem for me was that it never quite kicked up that extra gear to get out of ""average"" and into ""good"". It's doesn't have that one aspect that elevates it beyond competent. As others have said, it's really similar to ""The Mummy"" in terms of both plot and character, but's not as good as that film.I'd probably give the characters another chance if Disney did make a sequel, but I can't see me rushing back to watch this any time soon.",Jungle Cruise

The jokes arent really funny. So what's left? A rather mediocre story is left, that lasts half an hour too long (2 hours in total!).Not recommended. Better watch one of the many Raiders of the Lost Ark movies with Harrison Ford, because those movies excite, those movies are really adventurous and they are also quite funny, everthing Jungle Cruise isnt.",Jungle Cruise
28,lisafordeay,Decent film with bad CGI,6,1 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise is a 2021 Action Fantasy Comedy starring Dwanye Johnson,Emily Bunt,Jack Whiteshall and Paul Giamatti. A botanist named Lily Houghton(Emily Blunt) teams up with her flamboyant brother MacGregor Houghton(Jack Whiteshall) across South America where they are guided by Frank Wolff(Dwanye Johnson) who helps them find a mysterious tree that has been cursed decades ago. The tree allows people who are sick or injured to heal again(yeah sounds like the magic flower from Tangled doesn't it). However Lily isn't the only one who is seeking for the tree,as a German prince named Joachim(played by Jesse Plemons who I swear reminds me of Philip Seymour Hoffman) is also seeking the tree. Will Lily,MacGregor and Frank find the tree ?Overall I thought it was a good flick. Not many people will like it due to the bad CGI,the actual plot itself and the blink and you miss it action sequences. But I guess the main reason why I watched it was for Dwanye Johnson as I always admired this guy. Sure his typecast as the next Vin Diesel who is always in Jungle themed films or playing these really sarcastic charming men but overall I enjoy his films(as I seen most of them). I also liked the chemistry between Dwayne and Emily.There is even a twist in this film which I did not expect(without giving too much away its on one of the characters).C.",Jungle Cruise

The movie could look stupid and I'll go see it the watch the People's Movie Star. This was one of those movies, or rather it starts that way but there is a point for me when everything gels and suddenly it becomes a movie worth seeing.The chemistry between DJ and Emily Blunt was typical, but Jessie's Plemons and Edgar Ramirez we're good villains.If this is Disney's next effort to make a ride or attraction into a movie franchise this was indeed not Pirates of the Caribbean.

30,DarkVulcan29,A cruise to remember,8,9 August 2021,"Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt have suprisingly good chemistry, seeing the trailers didn't think they would click, but then I saw the movie, and boy did they play off each other perfectly well.The story begins with an Indiana Jones like feel to it, with some Pirates of the Carribbean mixed in. Emily Blunt plays a tough female lead with such a strong ambition for adventure and to find what she is looking for. Dwayne Johnson plays his role a cross between Han Solo and Jack Sparrow. Jesse Plemons is also quite a joy to watch has the main villain, you can see he is having fun with his character. Effects are pretty good, and some surprises.

31,stevendbeard,Indiana Jane,8,1 August 2021,"I saw ""Jungle Cruise"", starring Dwayne Johnson-Ballers_tv, Baywatch_2017; Emily Blunt-the Quiet Place movies, The Wolfman_2010; Edgar Ramirez-Point Break_2015, The Bourne Ultimatum and Jesse Plemons-Judas and the Black Messiah, Battleship.In case you haven't heard-and I don't see how you haven't, but-this movie is based on the Disneyland amusement park ride. On the ride, a skipper takes a group of people through the jungle on a boat ride that is surrounded by wild animals and nasty natives. And all the time, the skipper tells bad jokes or puns-some are so bad they are good. And just because it's a Disney movie doesn't mean it is suitable for little kids, because it's not-it's rated 'PG-13'. There are some scenes that might frighten little ones, as well as some of the bigger ones, too-my wife was squeezing my arm on several occasions. Dwayne plays the skipper that is hired by Emily-a sort of Indiana Jane-to be a guide to take her down the river in pursuit of a magical flower that grows only in a certain area of the Amazon. Edgar plays a conquistador that failed in his quest 400 years earlier to find the flower and Jesse plays a Nazi trying to find the flower to help Germany win the war-this story takes place around 1917. The effects are good and the story has a nice twist near the end and if you are a Metallica fan-like me-you will hear a new version of 'Nothing Else Matters'.It's rated ""PG-13"" for adventure violence and has a running time of 2 hours & 7 minutes.I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on DVD.",Jungle Cruise

34,kevin_robbins,This was a fun family film but far from a classic,6,31 July 2021,"Jugle Cruise (2021) is a movie we saw opening night in the movie theatres. The storyline follows a brother and sister search for a tree of life, of sorts, in the deep jungles of Brazil. They hire a local boat cruise driver to help them find the tree. Meanwhile the Germans are also looking for the tree to help them in their mission for world domination. This movie is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (Orphan) and stars Dwayne Johnson (Rundown), Emily Blunt (Edge of Tomorrow), Paul Giamatti (American Splendor) and Jesse Plemons (The Irishman). The storyline for this picture was pretty much copy/paste of The Mummy just not as good - a brother and sister hire a local to track down the mummy in a unique CGI filled environment. The CGI animals and environment were awesome in this and the action was fun. The acting was solid and the chemistry between Johnson and Blunt was perfect.

Lily travels from London, England to the Amazon jungle and enlists Frank's questionable services to guide her downriver on La Quila--his ramshackle-but-charming boat. Lily is determined to uncover an ancient tree with unparalleled healing abilities--possessing the power to change the future of medicine. Thrust on this epic quest together, the unlikely duo encounters innumerable dangers and supernatural forces, all lurking in the deceptive beauty of the lush rainforest. But as the secrets of the lost tree unfold, the stakes reach even higher for Lily and Frank and their fate--and mankind's--hangs in the balance.Bottom line is this film may have some issues with its dialog. It does. But the set pieces , musical score , over the top FX visuals , first rate action sequences and the star power of ""The Rock"" along side Emily Blunt trump any of the writings short comings. Disney has put together a fantastic period piece Summer Blockbuster with its Jungle Cruise chocked full of tasty adventure tropes (arcane curses, snakes, evil Germans).

42,rgkarim,"Cruising Down A River Of Fun, Laughs, and CGI",8,30 July 2021,"LIKES:Pacing:
The movie takes little time to get things going, an adventure movie that lays down the stakes, tells you the purpose and then gets going with quick character introduction. Jungle Cruise's pacing only continues to move at a steady pace, continuing to give you the feeling of being on a supped up version of the ride as it blazes a trail down the Amazon in search of the mystical fruit that can cure all. And yet, it still provides ample opportunity to give you the character dynamics, background, and interactions that you hope to get with main characters.Fun Movie:
With the goal of being geared towards families, Jungle Cruise accomplishes the mission of being fun for the whole family to enjoy. A great blend of comedy, warm hearted interactions, cute CGI animals, and some decently balanced action are all wonderful mixtures to set you on a fun adventure. I found myself diving back into the golden era of Disney live action movies, that found a way to bring some heart without crossing over too many boundaries of dark, kiddy, or sappy, that many of the modern era movies tend to tread. That fun was due to a lot of things for me, which I've talked about below.Darker Elements Make For Stakes:
Part of what helped make it endearing were the darker elements of the movie. Like the first Pirates, life in this movie is not magical rainbows and ignorance to the struggles of the world, oh no not even close. There is a darker history in the realm of the Amazon that holds danger and excitement, and this story used it well. Like Pirates of the Caribbean, the actions of man speak volumes in this story and paint some engaging characters that are very reminiscent of the Barbosa and his pirate crew. Their motivations, alongside the abilities granted to them, are part of that Disney magic I love to see, familiar to be nostalgic and fun, but different enough to warrant originality points.Design/Setting:
Disney knows how to utilize their resources well to craft these worlds we fall in love, and Jungle Cruise continues to show off their muscles. The Jungle itself is beautifully crafted, feeling much like the dark, dangerous worlds of the rain forest that we've read about so often. It's vibrant colors hide many dangers, and I loved seeing Disney dance with what flora and fauna they could bring to challenge our group. Deadly bugs, booby traps, even the water itself was crafted amazingly to be the deadly playground for these daring explorers to test their merits in. Costumes get a shout as well, a variety of clothing from the past that showed off the trends of our ancestors, and also managing to give some flair to the normal tribal outfits that stood out to me. Yet it was the CGI conquistadors who get a bit more of a thumbs up in their animation and unique structure. I can't say much without ruining it, but the cursed heroes are certainly amalgams of their curse and I loved getting to see how their abilities varied and reflected the very prison they stomped around in.The Comedy:
While not quite as clever or genius as Pirates' writing, Jungle Cruise made a solid effort in bringing the laughs for this reviewer and his fellow audience. The Rock is a natural at dad jokes and puns, but also using that same sarcasm and stubbornness to his advantage to sell many of his lines. A CGI sidekick offers its own brand of comedy as well, a unique pet that has human like qualities and blunders that bring out some well-timed dialogue. And of course being Disney, plenty of accidental slapstick keeps things whimsical and fun despite the shadows they face beneath the leaves of the Amazon.The Acting:
With such a dynamic cast, I must say I was impressed with how well everyone worked in this rather bold idea. The Rock as the leading man continues to be a fun actor, while not really playing too different of a role, he has mastered his performance quite well to always make his films entertaining despite the one note he plays Jack Whitehall has the quirky brother role down as well, a sort of Jonathan from the Mummy like quality that is again entertaining and yet touching at the right moments to offset the strong personalities he is with. Jesse Plemons did a nice job in the humorous toned down villain role that Disney movies love making. I could picture more from him in the future, but was good for what I think the studio made him do. Ramirez was quite the main villain, and had a lot of fire and looks to his role, but... he just needed more time on screen to really show me everything he had. The champion of the movie is of course Emily Blunt, whose diversity, quirks, and execution were nearly perfect in every aspect. Balanced and strong, but again with vulnerabilities of her character, she is an example of a main character I hope other movies take a page from instead of the mess we have been getting.DISLIKES:The CGI:
Again, better than what I could generate, the Jungle Cruise still has a ways to go to blow me out of the water with the realness of their CGI. Much of the movie has that artificial tone to it, primarily in the animals that roam about the jungle. Sometimes it works well given the human qualities they want to bestow, but the artificial look still needs some practice before they obtain the levels that Avatar and Transformers accomplished long ago.More Time In the Adventure:
Several times the movie decides to take shortcuts on the trip, reducing the potential obstacles of the Amazon to merely tracing a line over the map. I understand it was to help save time and money, but these quick bouts of missing the river sort of felt like an incomplete adventure, one that could have involved much more fun from the Disney studios. Crocodiles/gators? Deadly birds? Heck even some sort of serpent would have felt right at home in this Amazonian lore to really give the adventure the complete picture it needed. Such interruptions disturbed the natural flow of the story, and in some cases shortsheeted the characters they were starting to build up resulting in incomplete use of the cast. Looking back at movies like Pirates of the Caribbean, it's amazing how spoiled I was with the balance they achieved, and though Jungle Cruise has approached this more than other movies it still has room to improve.The action:
Ahhh, the modern age has sort of messed up the action genre given the lack of balance and political preferences that seem to plague everything these days. Jungle Cruise managed to inject some themes into their fights in this installment, granting them the child approved fights (for the most part) as the group decked it out. Normally this works in an animated film like Toy Story or Zootopia, but in a movie like this... it again feels a bit disappointing at how diluted the fights feel. Submarine chases with little bite to them, promising fights with cursed soldiers reduced to a few edits of chops before switching to something else, and poor extras making exaggerated stabs at nothing before getting pushed away are some of the ""fighting"" you have to look forward to in this tale. I'll say it again, but looking at the first pirates movie shows you can have engaging sword fights, battles against the ships, and some decent chases that are adult and kid friendly as they fit into the theme.The Cursed Conquistadors:
These guys took the brunt of being cut from the film and I had wanted more involvement with them given how quintessential they were to the story. With interesting and dynamic designs, a power set to be truly terrifying to work around, and some personal connections, the group dropped the ball on new landmark villains in place of more laughs and toned down violence. Many of the side soldiers seemed to have stories of their own, but their personalities were lost to the two or three other stories this movie had and that was a shame given their potential. This movie really needed to look at not overdoing it with the stories and finding one or two tales to hit and weaving the side stories in a bit better.The VERDICT:Jungle Cruise turns out to be another fun ride to movie translation that has a lot of family friendly elements they were gunning to achieve. The pace overall is welcoming to a variety of attention spans, and infuses lots of laughs, toned down fights, and character development to help the audience enjoy the adventure at hand. A world with lots of beautiful designs, one may feel as immersed as I was in the visuals and sounds the studio made to try and get us in the South American biome. And the acting is another great example of casting that gives performances with remarkable chemistry, well timed delivery, and a mastery at points of playing Disney characters.However, the movie still fails to achieve the fluidity that Pirates of the Caribbean had all those years ago, potentially due to the sensitivity of the current generation. Cuts in the adventure and making the story predictable sort of lightens up on the edge the movie was starting to develop, and the comedic aspects of the CGI characters while cute sometimes gets in the way of the adventure element I was hoping to see. Yet it's the action and bad guys who suffer the most In this film feeling sort of rushed and censored in order to allow more age groups to see the film and capitalize on its success. I'm not saying it has to involve dismemberment and blood, but Pirates proves how darkness can be wielded to engage a story and still be okay for audience members. Still, the movie was much better than I anticipated and therefore I'm giving it.Action/Adventure/Comedy: 7.5

43,rannynm,Makes The Magic Of The Riverboat Attraction From Disneyworld Come Alive.,9,7 August 2021,"Take a trip to the Amazon Rainforest in Disney's new, beautifully produced film Jungle Cruise. Starring such talented actors as Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt and Jack Whitehall, the film is inspired by the famous theme park ride and liberally incorporates details from it as well, like the boat captain's terrible puns and a reference to the ""back side of water."" It's a great family film!Set in 1916, Jungle Cruise opens in London, during a meeting of scientists. McGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) is presenting to the crowd as his sister, Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt), goes about her mission to collect a precious artifact from the archives. She ropes her brother, a rare gay character in the Disney universe, into the adventure she's been chasing since her childhood, determined to journey into the Amazon to an area called Lágrimas de Cristal and find a magical healing tree called the Tears of the Moon. Lily hates the rough-around-the-edges, scam artist Frank (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) as soon as she sees him, but she grudgingly agrees to employ him as their skipper down the Amazon, with the conniving German aristocrat Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) nipping at their heels. Many adventures follow and the characters, as different as they may seem, grow close as a chosen family. There's also a pretty unusual supernatural backstory.As with any Disney film, the production quality of Jungle Cruise is incredibly high; each and every small detail in regards to the graphics and overall look of the film has been addressed thoroughly. This film's previously-mentioned punchy one-liners delivered by Dwayne Johnson allude to this film's origins in the theme park ride. The Rock undoubtedly, unquestionably puts on the best performance of the film, and his chemistry with Emily Blunt's character is what truly carries the film through some slow moments when the script seems to lose purpose. Viewers begin to forget the overall goal of the mission as plots and relationships mix. However, this problem only shows up in the last third of the film. Another major star in the film is Jack Whitehall. His character is especially significant given that it's one of the few instances where you can see an LGBTQ+ character on screen, and his struggles coming out in a rigid, heteronormative society are beautifully represented in a heart-to-heart with Frank. In summary, the cast and production quality take this film to a new level, while the script tends to bog it down.Jungle Cruise promotes teamwork, grit, the victory of good over evil, and, my favorite message, that no matter how different we are, there's always something we can unite over. We're always stronger together.I give Jungle Cruise 4.5 stars out of 5 and recommend it for ages 8 to 18, plus adults.

Dwayne Johnson plays Frank, a steamboat captain who resembles Humphrey Bogart, which I believe was done purposefully. The story and settings made me think of a movie mashup of Jumanji and Pirates of the Caribbean. The only thing missing was Johnny Depp, but with his current legal issues, he may not be in too many Disney films going forward. Time will tell.However, for a film based on a theme park ride, Jungle Cruise is right up there with the original Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. It was a fun watch, hardly ever boring. On another note though, the acting could have been better. It felt as though Emily Blunt was just phoning in her lines, like she really didn't care.

Director Jaume Collet-Serra has given us a film that's entertaining but, not entertaining enough. There is barely any genuine humor in the movie & a lot of tedious exposition. Dwayne Johnson's Jumanji franchise is so much better. The action set pieces are fantastic. The visual effects are phenomenal. Dwayne Johnson is brilliant as Frank Wolff. Emily Blunt is spectacular as Lily Houghton. Johnson & Blunt share this effortless camaraderie in all their scenes together. Edgar Ramirez is effective as Aguirre. Jack Whitehall is amazing as MacGregor Houghton. Jesse Plemons is outstanding as Prince Joachim. Plemons' performance is the highlight of the film & I wish he had more screen time. Paul Giamatti is good as Nilo Nemolato. The supporting cast is impressive. Jungle Cruise is worth a watch if you're a Dwayne Johnson & Emily Blunt fan. Just keep your expectations relatively low.

Then look no further than the Disney Live Action film JUNGLE BOOK.Yes...Disney has made another movie based on one of it's them park rides and this one is more like the first PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN film than most of the other attempts.Directed by Jaume Collet-Serra (several Liam Neeson action flicks like NON-STOP), JUNGLE CRUISE is part PIRATES, part INDIANA JONES and part AFRICAN QUEEN (look it up, kids) as we follow an adventurous young lady in the 1910's. She heads to the Amazon and hires a ne'er do well Jungle Cruise skipper to take her up river.Pretty standard set-up, right? We've seen this ""mis-matched"" frenemies premise before but in the hands of Emily Blunt and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, it is a very entertaining (albeit familiar) ride with 2 tremendously charismatic performers working off each other very well and they look like they are having as good a time in this film as we are.They are joined by a bevy of assorted characters that help fill out this journey. Edgar Ramirez and Veronica Falcon are enjoyable enough as a couple of characters along the way, while Jack Whitehall surprised the heck out of me as the wimpy brother to Blunt's character who becomes more and more three dimensional as the film progressed - something I didn't think this film would even think about doing.A pair of wiley veterans - Jesse Plemons and good ol' Paul Giamatti - are also on board and each add some (but not a lot) to this film. Plemons is the main villain and he just wasn't villainous enough for my tastes while I wanted much, much more of Giamatti's character than was in this film (and it is a rare film, indeed, that you are left wanting more with a Giamatti character).But make no mistake, this is a Rock and Blunt flick and these two professionals hold the center of this film together very, very well.Director Collet-Serra keeps the action (and comedy) moving along at about the right pace, never dwelling too long on any of the plot points (for if you were to think too much about any of it, it would fall apart) and (for the most part) keeps the action sequences fun and coherent and avoiding over-directing, over-CGI-ing and over-loading these sequences.Speaking of CGI, the main issue with this film is the special effects work - it is not the best (probably a budget issue) and, at times, you really need to suspend disbelief in watching the CGI and convincing yourself that it is a Live Action film you are watching and not a cartoon.But, since the intended audience for this film are families, the less-than-perfect CGI (at times) is forgivable as JUNGLE CRUISE provides plenty of PG-Rated action and fun that the entire family will enjoy.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Jungle Cruise
53,juanmuscle,I watched it cause I wanted to take a break,10,4 August 2021,"From the hardships of real life or hardcore storytelling which is what I normally gravitate to and I got just what I wanted! I did feel that it could of been a lil' toned down in some parts in the beginning but later it became clear to see that the spectral conquistadors were pretty scarry! But it was all in good fun , but they were kind of scary, but I loved every second of it no matter what! I read the reviews and wanted to check it out myself. One thing I didn't understand were the comments referencing other movies that had been done better, I did not see that at all, I saw some slices of Raiders but this thing felt like it did it's own unique thing and did it well! It was totally adorable across the board , cute sweet and very funnny and the play on words I found to enrich my heart with some sort of good vibes and infused me with jolly feelings. I really enjoyed this from beginning to end, I did not see any plot holes cause it explained everything that it needed to and it was interlarded with witticisms and quips and tons of cool stuff! I highly recommend it , but just a couple of times with the angry conquistadors I found myself a lil' too scared! But that's OK, cause it all worked out! :) Anyway I loved it! I would highly recommend it and I think lil' lil' kids could get some fun things out of it if they go with older folk!",Jungle Cruise

Cheap C. G. I. Effects are used through the movie which sometimes insult the logical viewer.No I wouldn't recommend this even to my wort enemy.

56,Horror_Flick_Fanatic,Action adventures for families,8,2 August 2021,"It's a good action and adventure family film that is quintessential Disney. The Rock keeps the mood lively with his many jokes and puns. The production value such as the sets, CGI, wardrobe and the cinematography are top notch; exactly what I would expect from a Disney production. The Rock and Emily Blunt have good on screen chemistry. The pace of the film is fast with quick witty dialog lines and swashbuckling action scenes from both co-stars. The directing is superb. The entire flow of this film is as smooth as soft creamy sweet butter.However, as much as I liked this film, I couldn't help comparing and contrasting this modern day film aesthetics with the older classic ""The African Queen"" (1951) with Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart. It made me think how a remake of The African Queen might have look like today, without the Disneyfication in the script. I think the Rock could have pulled off Bogart's character.",Jungle Cruise
57,bob-the-movie-man,This Amazon based Disney attraction delivers!,9,2 August 2021,"Dating from 1955, Jungle Cruise was one of the key attractions at Disneyland when it first opened. Full of corny spiel from the lovable boat captains, the experience is nicely evoked in the new Disney movie: a true summer blockbuster that delights.Positives:
Cut the movie open and it reads ""summer blockbuster pleaser"" through the middle. This is largely down to the charisma of its two stars, Blunt and Johnson, who prove why they are both such bankable commodities. It's clearly based on the ""will they/won't they"" simmering sexual chemistry between two polar-opposites, as featured in movies such as ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""The African Queen"". (Since the theme park ride was heavily influenced by the latter, this is no surprise). But there's also a heavy dose of tongue-in-cheek ridiculousness as featured in other great B-movie homages such as ""The Mummy"" and (most notably) ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". (A few scenes directly mimic the Indiana Jones movies.)The supporting cast also have fun with their roles. Jack Whitehouse, doing almost a like-for-like copy of John Hannah's character in ""The Mummy"", could have been extremely annoying. But although he's the comic relief in the piece, he steers it just the right side of farcical, avoiding Jar-Jar Binks territory. (""When in Rome"" he declares, swallowing a flagon of fermented spit. ""God - I wish I was in Rome""!) Jesse Plemons, one of my favourite actors, who proved his comic chops in ""Game Night"", here delivers one of the most over-the-top Nazis since Ronald Lacey's Toht in ""Raiders"". Rounding things off is Paul Giamatti with a bizarrely comic performance as Nilo, a competing riverboat owner.Special effects, cinematography (Flavio Martínez Labiano, of ""The Shallows"") and James Newton-Howard's score all add to the lush blockbuster feel of the movie. And director Jaume Collet-Serra (who did the clever shark B-movie ""The Shallows"") keeps the movie clipping along at a fine rate, with only a few sections of character-building dialogue to get the kids fidgety.Negatives:
I mean, it's popcorn nonsense of course. The Amazonian 'McGuffin' is a tree that only comes to life under very specific conditions. And isn't it amazing that watery machinery (developed by who?) still works after at least 400 years, when my dishwasher gives up after ten? (But it's done with verve and style, so who cares?)Although the screenplay is actually very slick for a movie of this type, it feels like a script by committee at times. A single writer might have been tempted to duck the Hollywood ending and leave things on a more thoughtful, albeit downbeat, note.Summary Thoughts on ""Jungle Cruise"": This was a pleasant surprise for me. A fun and light-hearted movie that ticks all the boxes as a summer blockbuster. It nicely evokes the cheesiness of the theme park ride operator (past alumni have included Robin Williams and Kevin Costner), especially with Johnson's opening scenes. But then rounds it out as a spectacular and appealing tongue-in-cheek adventure.And, by the way, in case you fancy sitting through the interminable end titles to watch a post-credits scene.... there isn't one.(#takenonefortheteam).Parental Guidance: One question might be whether, with a ""12A"" certificate, this summer blockbuster is one that your kids might enjoy or be freaked out by. A comparison with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is perhaps useful here. There are quite a number of ""jolts"" involving snakes and bees but probably not as bad as the ones you get in an uncut version of ""Raiders"" (think the spiked Satipo; the mummies/snakes when escaping the 'Well of Souls'; and the melting Nazi bad-guys). So if you have kids that lapped up that stuff then I don't think they would have any issues with this one.(For the full graphical review, please check out One Mann's Movies on the web, Facebook or Tiktok.

After watching Jungle Cruise, i just wanna pretend that this movie was made by other company and not Disney, because Disney already releasing Cruella in May and that movie still my pick for best films of the year so far, so Disney already releasing a great yet dark film and they must releasing the light one too, Jungle Cruise is the one, my main problem in this movie is unfortunately the main duo, Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, it's the same case for me like Patricia Arquette and Christian Slater in True Romance, Johnson and Blunt was very good when they are separated, but when they're together, the performance become a mess, for Johnson it was alright, for Blunt it was alright too but sometime it's bad, why?, because they're chemistry is not there, and until one of the last scene of the movie, i started to see it and feel it, but that's it, and that was my main problem and the others was just some cringe and stupid scene but not much, now there is still a fun and good thing in Jungl e Cruise, and the best thing in the movie was the action, James Newton Howard score, and Jesse Plemons amazing performance, those three things really helping this movie and my rating for the movie, Jungle Cruise is almost an ok movie.",Jungle Cruise
59,pietclausen,Expected more,5,31 July 2021,"Emily Blunt kept it alive, but the rest of the cast were not up to scratch. More a rumpus through the jungle with too much talking, almost like rapping a bad song with nowhere to go.",Jungle Cruise
60,Sir_AmirSyarif,What a waste of colossal talent!,5,30 October 2021,Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt's charms can't rescue Jaume Collet-Serra's 'Jungle Cruise' from sinking. It's competently made but it's also lifeless and plagued by a slew of plot issues. The film aspires to be so many things that it fails to accomplish any of them properly. What a waste of colossal talent!,Jungle Cruise
61,kjproulx,A Fun Adventure that Feels too Familiar,6,3 August 2021,"It goes without saying that unless you're talking about Pirates of the Caribbean, Disney hasn't exactly hit a lot of home runs when developing a film based on their theme park rides. Tomorrowland had its moments and there was a bit of charm to The Haunted Mansion, even though the film wasn't good, but due to the lack of quality in this area, I couldn't get myself all that excited for Jungle Cruise. I'm a fan of both Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, so that alone was going to get at least one eventual viewing out of me, but I actually checked it out on opening weekend, and I must admit that I had a good time with it. It's a mixture of many adventure films that have all been done better, but those elements made it a fun ride. It's very far from great, but here's why I'd still recommend Jungle Cruise.Jungle Cruise gets going right off the bat. A riverboat skipper by the name of Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) is enlisted by hunter Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) to take her and her brother to an enchanted cave to discover if the myths are true. Without going into details of what they're searching for, this film builds to a very colourful finale, but this aspect is actually the film's biggest downfall. The first act of the film feels like a mixture of Indiana Jones and The Mummy (which is what everyone else has been comparing it to as well), but with the feel of Pirates of the Caribbean. That may seem like a complaint, but it borrows aspects of all these films without feeling like a rip-off. As I said though, it's really the third act that is an overall detriment.As the film gets going, I was chuckling quite a few times at the cheesy one-liners Johnson would deliver and his chemistry with Blunt was also terrific. Her character was very likeable and her motive was reasonable enough to serve the story. The biggest issue I had with the film is that where it all leads to didn't feel unique enough. It felt like visuals and settings that have been seen many times before. Once the adventure aspect of the film concludes, I was more or less just wanting to see their journey back or for the film to just end. I would almost call the first two acts of the film very good, but the conclusion really bogged it down for me.Overall, nothing about this film felt original, which is what kept me from being able to call it great. It's undeniably fun to watch, due to the stars having a blast, but it's just visually like many other films. It has some great moments and Jesse Plemons as Prince Joachim stole the show for me. His presence just ate up the scenery and I loved it. Jungle Cruise is far from being a bad film but I would direct everyone to many other adventure flicks before this one. Still, as I said, if you can look past the fact that it's a bunch of the classics all meshed together, it's quite a fun experience in the end. Now in theatres and streaming on Disney+, I can mildly recommend this one.",Jungle Cruise
62,Movi3DO,Fun adventure,7,31 July 2021,"The Rock? In the jungle? Jumanji sequel?A new adventure in the jungle from Disney. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt embarked on a journey searching for the legendary tree of life.As an adventure, it was solid and entertaining. The cinematography of the jungle was amazing with beautiful wide shots of the rivers, hills, and trees. Also, the main characters had a lot of action and came through many places in the jungle. The designs of the the cursed characters, especially the one with the snakes, looked amazing. If you watch this movie in the theater, it would be quite a great experience (it's still great watching on Disney Plus). Of course, this was all expected from this type of movie and also from Disney.The story, tho, wasn't as solid as the adventure. The biggest problem was that there wasn't a sense of urgency or strong justification for why the characters wanted to go on the trip. The backstory felt rushed and didn't have a big impact on me or how I felt about the characters. Because of this, at the end, I didn't feel as satisfied as I could have. There was also a theme of sexism in old society, and it felt forced.The cast did great playing their characters. I liked Dwayne Johnson the most, not that he was phenomenal, although he did bring the charisma to the character. However, the story didn't do a good job of getting me invested in the characters. The villains were of course bland and not memorable.Overall, a fun enough adventure that I would still recommend, despite its problems in story and characters. 6.5/10.",Jungle Cruise
63,Neptune165,Too much CGI,4,1 August 2021,"It's so cheesy and quippy just really really stupid. Dwayne Johnson is painfully miscast, He can't take on every role there is. He simply didn't belong here. For another thing, the bombardment of poor CGI got very old, very quick. Even though it wasn't a large part of the movie, There was no real sense of adventure or fun, just a mish-mash of highly predictable set pieces tossed together. This movie copied many themes and even the whole plot from the mummy 1999, from the first scene in the library till the last scene and even the whole setting in 1916, they can even cross it with the mummy cast and story in the sequels. Disney just copies and pastes from other movies. That's all they do now. Sometimes they do it from their own movies.",Jungle Cruise

67,SoumikBanerjee25,I miss the Old Disney!,6,2 August 2021,"As someone who grew up with an impressive catalog fraught with their incomparable creations; it pains me to see Disney in such a sorry state nowadays. Hard to believe, this is the same studio that had at one time brought us some fine pieces of work in the same Genre (Fantasy/Adventure). If I were to take names, Pirates of the Caribbean, The Chronicles of Narnia; these two come first to mind.However, for the past few years; fate has not been so kind to them. Lawsuits, Protests, Strikes; they have been in the news for all the wrong reasons (They still are), And now that everyone's once-beloved Studio is slowly losing its charm, It's high time; they take these matters all the more seriously and try to recuperate their legacy before it's too late.Now, coming back to my review...""Jungle Cruise"", as luxurious as it may sound from the title; I'm sorry to inform, it's not quite up to par with general expectancies. With discernible commonalities to Disney's past endeavors; this is yet again the same platter presented in a different way. Now that is completely fine as long as they do it in a proper fashion! Which, with all due respect; hasn't really been the case over here!At the same time, having two very likable personalities at the forefront has surely helped. Cause let the truth be told, Dwyane Johnson and Emily Blunt; both pretty much carried this entire execution on their able shoulders.Without them, things could have been much worse; I reckon!Apart from being Visually Poignant; needless to say, this meticulous style of presentation has the Trademark of Disney written all over it! Not to mention, the Score; which as you'd expect, neatly complemented the on-screen depiction. Hence from a technical viewpoint, I am pleased to say; everything went rather smoothly.When it comes down to Humor, for the most part; it's been hit or miss. But I'll admit, I had fun with a few one-liners occasionally! Albeit, the same cannot be said about its Screenplay! Attributable to its stagnant nature; the pace drastically drops and as a result, the movie hangs heavy at certain moments. Even the final act has been a victim of a similar treatment!Reading through all of this, if you still can't get ahold of my final verdict; then let me just simplify it for you.This is an honorable OTW (One-time-watch) at best. Not entirely child-friendly (Please keep that in mind); but an entertaining and charming ride nonetheless. If you happen to have a mood for some Adventure stuff; rest assured, you would be having a good enough time with this.",Jungle Cruise
68,MrDHWong,Provides predictable thrills that should keep young viewers on the edge of their seats but all others need not apply,6,5 August 2021,"""Jungle Cruise"" is an adventure film based on the Disneyland ride of the same name. Starring Dwayne The Rock Johnson, Emily Blunt, and Jack Whitehall, it provides predictable thrills that should keep young viewers on the edge of their seats but all others need not apply.In 1916 in London, Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) and her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) attempt to persuade the Royal Society to allow them access to a rare artefact that could help in locating the fabled Tears of the Moon tree, which contain a flower with the ability to cure all known illnesses. When their request is denied, the two of them instead steal the artefact for themselves and quickly set off for South America. Shortly after arriving in Brazil, the siblings meet the eccentric river cruise guide Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson), whom is hired by the pair to aid them in their search for the tree. Unbeknownst to the trio, the unhinged German aristocrat Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) is hot on their trail with the intent to use the tree to gain immortality for himself.Since the late 90s, Disney has occasionally been adapting their selected theme park rides into movies, each with varying degrees of success. Some have gone on to be among the highest grossing films of all time, with the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise raking in over $4.5 billion at the box office, while others bombed so badly I forgot they even existed, like 2002's ""The Country Bears"". ""Jungle Cruise"" is the most recent ride to get the big screen treatment, and with little other source material to extract from, it just narrowly manages to justify its existence.As someone who has actually been on two variations of the titular ride (California and Hong Kong), I can say it was quite fun travelling on a boat through these imaginatively set up jungle areas. To enhance the experience, they have raging torrents of water, exotic animals appearing from thick trees, and the sound of the natives drumming in the background along the way. They truly make you feel as though you have been transported into a colonial era jungle, so naturally translating something like this into a film will never be able to live up to the real thing.This adaptation instead goes for a typical adventure fare in the vein of Indiana Jones, so much so that anyone who has seen films like that will likely be bored from the constant clichés thrown at us. The entire plot is something that has been done to death so many times before - adventurers seek out world-changing MacGuffin to prevent it from falling into the wrong hands - been there, done that. Of course, being a Disney film, the target audience here is young children so it is doubtful that they have seen anything remotely like this before. With that said, I think said children will probably find this film to be a fun distraction to keep them occupied for the two hour runtime.As far as visuals go, the film is a huge mishmash of CGI and obvious green screen effects. None of the jungle animals looked real at all, obviously being products of something created on a sterile computer. Because of this, I didn't feel any tension during the action scenes. For example, a part where Lily and Frank are swinging on a vine made me laugh out loud at how fake it appeared, clearly being a product of poorly implemented green screen editing in post production. Now whether this was done intentionally to pay homage to the cheesiness of the old adventure serials from many decades ago or if it's just laziness on behalf of the filmmakers is up for debate, though I'm going with the latter. Again, I had to remind myself that the main group of people watching this is children who aren't going to care too much about things like that so I suppose it doesn't really matter in the long run.There's something interesting about how Dwayne Johnson has this ability to instantly become such a likeable presence on screen regardless of whom he shares it with. His character Frank, despite making the odd cringe-inducing pun every now and then, was one of the best parts of the film. I liked his confidence in how he was able to find his way out of a sticky situation whenever the plot required it. He's the type of hero that kids look up to, which means he is the most practical selling point for a film like this. Additionally, both Emily Blunt and Jack Whitehall played off Johnson quite well as the British sibling duo Lily and MacGregor. The stark contrast between Lily's adventurous spirit and MacGregor's timid mannerisms made for some fun banter between the both of them. If all three of these characters didn't work as well as they did, then the film would have been a complete failure.Overall, it would be easy to dismiss this project as yet another example of Disney trying to milk their intellectual properties for all they're worth, but we need to remember who their target audience is. They have, and always will, catered to younger demographics when it comes to promoting their media, and a film like ""Jungle Cruise"" is a perfect example of just that. It kills two birds with one stone by both offering a fun movie for children while also advertising the very ride it is based on for any potential tourists wishing to visit Disneyland one day. Even if people like me can't enjoy it as much as the kids do, I can at least appreciate its ability to entertain and shut them up for a while.I rate it 6/10.",Jungle Cruise

Maybe that's just because I tend to like Charlize Theron a lot, but I will say Emily Blunt did a great job too. Maybe I just haven't seen her enough yet. I can see why Disney chose Emily Blunt, also (she's very talented).I never thought a movie based on a ride would be good, but this is definitely the best movie (available on streaming) I've seen this summer (even though I haven't seen Cruella or Black Widow yet -- am I leaving anything else out?).However, I still think directors and producers today don't obsess over each scene (or the movie overall) like in the past, resulting in slightly less quality movies.

Yes, I suppose Universal Studios could sue Disney for stealing the template to ""The Mummy"" (1998). But, hey...hope Disney steals a ""Fast..."" storyline at some point.This movie is fun. And that's all you should be concerned about. For those who forgive Marvel movies for the same offenses, sorry you refuse to draw the same comparisons. Perhaps you are too dense to see how often they cycle through the same stories. And too illiterate to see they hide their references well.This movie wants you to like it. Emily wants you to like her. And that is admirable.Forget the woke-ness of its message. In any other world the ""plucky"" Blunt would be knocked cold from any male dockworker. So you already know this is a fantasy already, since she can defend herself against the roughnecks (I dare her to pretend to do so in real life).

The unlikely pair encounter innumerable dangers and supernatural forces, all lurking in the deceptive beauty of the lush rainforest. Jungle Cruise is another adaption from one of Disney World's most beloved rides, and creates a whole adventure from the experience. Disney has had some success with their film adaptions of rides, most notably Pirates of the Caribbean, but the others have fallen short from something memorable. Jungle Cruise exceeded my expectations. It doesn't suffer from trying to find some logical story when the ride has none. Now, that isn't to say this is great or anything. Beneath all of the fun action scenes and excitement, it's a fairly basic story that we've seen a time or two. It takes inspiration from such classics as Romancing the Stone and The Goonies. Sometimes it feels like it's trying to make up for its average storytelling with all the diverting bustle. Honestly, it takes a good 30 minutes of setting up before getting into the promised boat ride. It's smooth sailing for a bit, but without compelling antagonists and a few twists (one being a bit far-stretched), it can't reach the level it thinks it's at.If anything succeeds, it's the chemistry of the two leads. The two are wildly entertaining and perfectly cast in their roles. They're good with the comedy, especially with The Rock's puns straight from the ride, and Blunt has all the skills of an adventurous soul ready for anything. Jack Whitehall slowly grew on me as the movie progressed almost making him feel like a lead as well. Overall, I nice choice of actors. On the ride, we're given beautiful sceneries of the Amazon. A few of the visual effects needed some work, surprisingly when it's just the back ground while on the boat, but it's pleasant to look at. Director Jaume Collet-Serra had big plans for the movie, but may have overstuffed it a bit. What it needed was some time to breathe. Constantly, something is happening, so when we get though slower moments it can ruin the pacing. Most of it comes from time taken to tell a backstory that isn't all that remarkable. But I guess some of the information is helpful. Jungle Cruise is an alright movie. Nothing super notable but a pretty enjoyable movie. With the lack of adventurous movies and ones kids would be interested in (even though this is PG-13), this has been a hit with most general moviegoers. If you're not expecting too much, this is worth the watch. And maybe if you are expecting big things, this could be for you.",Jungle Cruise

80,MovieCriticOnline,Please.. no more..,1,3 October 2021,"I know it's based on a Disney ride so you expect a bit of levity, but could they do something in Hollywood without the standard formulated repartee? Everything was so overly choreographed to the point that I never felt any danger.So much violence for a Disney film and I don't mind violence but it seemed like every 3 minutes there was a 5-minute action scene with fighting.You knew nothing about the characters and characters don't matter anymore in Hollywood, because it's all plot, action and special effects.Everything was done with 100% foley and voice over which made it sterile. I know it's supposed to be a ride, but can we have a minute break without the camera and actors moving? It was nauseating. I don't think they stayed on one shot more than 3 seconds without an edit. Try to find 10 seconds in the film where they didn't cut to another shot. Good luck.The editing was so disjointed. From medium, to close up, to wide, to close, to medium, to profile etc. And it was only done to keep up ""the energy"" but instead was too distracting.And then the annoying score. It was wall-to-wall music telling us how to feel.Also what was really annoying was the constant rack focus, which was likely done in post, but I kept thinking stuff was out of focus to then realize they were focusing on one actor, and then 2 seconds later they rack-focused on another actor in the same shot. Bizarre.Every action was forced by the characters, which is a sign of bad writing. Don't create actions in a film driven by deliberate poor decisions from the characters. For example, if someone tells you, you will die if you got that way, and then you insist on going that way you are letting poor decisions create the action rather than letting the action come to them.This movie epitomizes the majority of films in Hollywood, all rides, no heart.Lastly, the Jaguar looked so fake.There is a reason why this bombed. Do better, Hollywood.",Jungle Cruise

But with an amazing cast and great chemistry between Johnson and Blunt.This movie was made for unexpected entertainment. Let's be honest though, this movie was all thanks to the special effects department. Shots were beautifully done and it was almost like watching a moving art gallery. I cannot recall the last really good family movie I enjoyed with my son, this one was very good. After all, I had to watch Cruella by myself because he said it was a girls movie!Crazy but after seeing Johnson dressed in clothes from the 1916 I would have liked to see him in a movie from that era.

Though more Uncharted than the almost-perfect-script the Mummy movie has. It does share many elements, and some of the structure as well. Probably why it is a good release (the old tried and true). If you know not of either, you could compare it to a Pirates of the Caribbean.. which is adequate, as this being based on a Disney ride as well.It is a ""fun"" adventure with fantastic elements, a ""treasure"" to seek, and villains to put a damper on the hero's journey. But in the end, it feels somewhat hollow.. as if it didn't stick the landing or it missed something to tie it all together. The Lore itself is a bit lacking, and the tone is weird, although not entire bad.STILL! Animal and Jungle Visual Effects are impressive at times. As is the added artistic style throughout (be it the little map animation or enchanting credits, as well). Good characters, interactions and many of the OBNOXIOUS skipper jokes we all love.I might not watch it again (I might, if I completely forget about it ), but I would still recommend it for a Friday-night.** Also.. for a movie with a Spanish cast (which is very good, although too much on the side).. couldn't they help the Rock with his pronunciation?",Jungle Cruise

88,DeBBss,An unremarkably entertaining movie,6,1 August 2021,"There's nothing really exceptional about Jungle Cruise. It tells a safe and simplistic story that's also fairly predictable. In honesty, I wasn't expecting the story to be anything special considering its's a Disney film. What really carries this movie are its characters. Dwayne Johnson knows how to play a charismatic character, and in this film, he does a great job. It's hard not to like Frank in this film, he actually outshines all the other characters. Lily and Macgregor are just really unremarkable. I don't know if they're supposed to be stereotypes or parodies, but they seem quite one-dimensional with their character traits and development.One of the biggest flaws with this movie are its visuals. There's way too much CGI, and it's very noticeable. The CGI itself wasn't particularly bad, it's just that there was too much of it. And the pacing was a little off. There were times where the story should be ramping up, but it just slowed down.Jungle Cruise takes a lot of inspiration from other movies but it doesn't reach the same level as those movies. Jungle Cruise isn't a bad movie, it just plays everything in the most safe and predictable way possible. You can certainly find entertainment out of Jungle Cruise, but don't expect anything too special out of this movie.",Jungle Cruise

Director: Jaume Collet Serra
starring: Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, Jack Whitehall, Edgar Ramirez, Jesse Plemons, Paul Giamatti etcDr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) enlists the aid of wisecracking skipper Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) to take her down the Amazon in his ramshackle boat. Together, they search for an ancient tree that holds the power to heal a discovery that will change the future of medicine. I was incredibly disappointed with this film, and it was for me one of Disney's weakest entries in their live action cannon.My first few positives would be the cinematography, background to the plot and fun set up. As well as the charming tone and chemistry between the leads. The film was visually stunning. With some beautiful cinematography and the scope of the film was fantastic. The shots built such a rich and colourful world and was one of the films strongest elements. I liked the background given to the plot, the details about why the ancient tree was so important and setting up a lot of the film's mythology was a really great element. Leading to a fun set up when Lily and Frank met that introduced the characters well and was a solid way to develop the plot into the second act. The film did also have a lot of charm in places. This was mostly due to the lead performances from Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson. Their characters were so likeable and charming that it really made the scenes work a lot better. The chemistry from Emily and Dwayne was also excellent, they worked excellently together. They bounced off each other very well, with some fantastic banter and even well written romantic chemistry between them both that worked so well.However, my first few negatives would be how generic and corny the film was. The lack of set up. The messy first act and the poor villains. The film was unfortunately very unoriginal. Following far too many tropes from this kind of genre. And borrowing far too heavily off other better films before it. It felt like a rehash of other films and didn't do enough to carve its own brand and product. The film was also extremely corny, the dialogue was very poor and so by the books and it just didn't work. This film just went to over the top and corny and it really made it awkward to watch. There was also a lack of set up to the main plot point. It felt like they did only half the job with the set up. Setting up the main two characters on their journey well. But almost forgetting about the actual threat to their journey and not setting up the villains properly. There true intentions were shown too late within the first act. The first act in general was very messy. It felt rushed and unfocused and did a mediocre job with setting up the main plot point and needed a lot of refining. The villains were also poor. One was way too over the top and campy and didn't pose enough of a threat for me too care. And the other more interesting villains were extremely underused and were a missed opportunity.My next few positives would be the humour and fun scenes. The connection between the villains. As well as the action and great worldbuilding. I thought some of the humour really worked. The jokes between Lily and Frank worked very well, and some of the corny puns from Frank also worked very well mostly due to Dwayne Johnson's comedic timing but also reflecting what the ride is like in real life. There were also some fun scenes with the boat that worked well, seeing how Frank did his tours on his boat was incredibly entertaining, and a lot of the scenes with just the characters travelling on the boat were also fun and thrilling to watch. I also liked the connection between the villains. I liked that the film connected the two villains. I think it would have been even more messy if they had two separate villains with different goals. But the film did a good job at connecting them both and having both characters have a similar goal. The action was also a lot of fun. It was entertaining, funny and well-choreographed. Emily Blunt especially did a fantastic job with her action scenes that really made her character stand out. I also thought the worldbuilding with the film was excellent. The film went into good amounts of details of the curse with the villains and really expanded the story world of the film excellently. It left it open for more to be explored and added more layers to the film that was needed.My next few negatives would be the terrible CGI. Most of the humour falling flat, the pacing issues. As well as the bad queerbaiting and annoying character moments. The CGI within this film was poor in places. Considering its 200million budget, you could tell when green screen was being used. And so many of the animals looked laughably unrealistic. Most of the humour in the film fell completely flat. It was awkward to watch. The film was trying way too hard to make the jokes land and it achieved the complete opposite. With jokes that didn't even really work the first time repeated constantly to the point where it got annoying and tedious. The film had so many pacing issues. I honestly got bored through a lot of the second act. The pacing was so inconsistent, ranging from completely rushing over scenes to just dragging along without much happening in the plot. There were also some annoying character moments. Frank would often trick Lily into certain scenes, were it would appear something was happening but then it turned out to be planned. This made the pacing extremely clunky. And it just meant the plot wasn't really going anywhere and it completely ruined any form of tension that was created. One of my biggest issues with the film was the Queerbaiting. Disney keep on doing this. Where they have an obviously gay character, but never mention anything about it apart from one copout scene that fell flat, and Disney achieved nothing apart from making themselves appear diverse when they weren't.My final few positives would be the fun character designs, the great plot twist and character depth. And the fun final act. I thought the character designs for the cursed soldiers were great. They were inventive and fun, and all the different crew had their own distinct design, and their powers were interesting and dark in places. I also thought the plot twist was excellent. I didn't see it coming at all. It added a much-needed twist to the film. Frank being immortal really added so much more depth to his character and raised the stakes due to the connection with the villains. Finally, the final act was also entertaining. The action was fun, the tension between Frank and the villains was well developed. And it was fun to watch.My final few negatives would be how predictable the film was as well as the odd creative decisions. The film was painfully predictable, especially in the final act. This was disappointing because so many elements were entertaining. But I could see the twists and certain plot points happening from a mile off. They were corny and caused a massive eye roll. I also thought that there were just some bad creative decisions with certain characters in the final act, where they would just go off randomly with another character for no reason and it felt very out of place to me.Overall, Jungle Cruise is held together by the charms of its leads. It had its charms and was entertaining. But borrows too heavily from other films and fails to carve its own path. In an unoriginal, predictable and dull film that unfortunately falls flat. And is sadly one of Disney's weakest live actions.Overall rating 54/100.",Jungle Cruise

91,ayoreinf,Stop counting the plot holes and enjoy the ride,8,8 August 2021,"This one is a joy ride that was given a plot. The plot is secondary the ride is the important part. So the movie takes us on a joy ride the way Disney knows and very loosely weaves a plot that does carry the movie from start to finish, mainly because the cast is first class performing their roles at the highest quality even when the roles are mere cartoons (take Jesse Plemons for an obvious example).So stop counting the goofs and the plot holes, you'll find plenty of them but they don't really matter. The ride is the purpose of the entire thing and if you come in for the joy ride that's exactly what you'll get I know I enjoyed it and all those who were in the auditorium with me coming out with a content sigh saying - ""that's Disney"" - yes it is and that's what they do best.",Jungle Cruise
92,movieman6-413-929510,Long cruise at a slow pace.,5,1 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise is an action adventure film directed by Jaume Collet-Serra, the director of The Shallows and Unknown.In the film, explorer Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) travels to the Amazon jungle with her brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall). Here she tries to research a mysterious tree that could cure all diseases. With the help of riverboat captain Frank Wolf (Dwayne Johnson), they can travel the Amazon rivers more easily. Lily must find the tree before others find it in order to use the tree and its possible gift for wrong purposes.Disney based the idea for this film on an attraction from their Disneyland theme park. So the writers of this film had little story to base the script on. This is reflected in the story of the film. To fill the two hours of playtime, they seem to mix up different storylines, which only complicates the film unnecessarily. Many of these storylines are also very similar to stories from other films, so that this film itself does not come across as original. If they had kept some storylines away and kept the movie so shorter, the movie would have been better.This movie is more fun for a younger audience or to watch with the family. But due to the long running time, children can lose interest in the film. Families can also watch other better movies together at home.Older viewers can see the visual effects that things were filmed in front of a green screen or that most of the animals were placed in the film using CGI. The CGI animals can be entertaining for younger viewers. Thanks to the green screen, it is also possible to visualize what people can see when they visit the attraction in Disney World.The acting is well done by most of the film's cast, but due to the size of the cast, not every actor has as much to do with his role. For example, there are too many villains in the film. What works best in the film is the mutual chemistry between Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson. Dwayne Johnson's character also makes a lot of bad puns. Many of these jokes can also be heard in the Jungle Cruise attraction.",Jungle Cruise

94,dasa108,Worse than I expected.,4,20 August 2021,"We have an unlikely story: there is a frantic woman unable to accept risks or analyze reality and who feels in her veins the obtuse feminine empowerment that continues to sting in our century; Our heroine is accompanied by a delicate gentleman who clearly seems to like to be with people of his sex and a hero who has an unlikely story behind: it is almost impossible for a Spaniard to appear Samoan. Leaving this aside, we have the other big problem: the mission loses interest as credulity is lost. The fantasy behind heroes and villains evaporates any chance of being interested in the plot and it does not work on almost any level. Leaving aside the promotion of acceptance and empowerment values to which Disney has us accustomed, I must say it with all the letters: the film is not original and it hardly stands up.",Jungle Cruise

The Rock is not nearly as fun or interesting as Johnny Depp. Emily Blunt is way past her prime for such a role. Her brother in the movie is not as handsome or mysterious as Orlando Bloom. And the evil captain has nothing against Geoffrey Rush.Further more, the effects are cartoonish at times. Maybe that was the intent, but, it doesn't work.At long last, the forced feminism is so out of place that it really hurts.There are but a few decent jokes and essentially no good ones and the action is not very fun.A lot of money was (miss-)spent on this one, but, that doesn't mean you should spent 2+ hours watching it.",Jungle Cruise

However, what makes it such a forgettable let-down is the procedure of discovering that it drags you out to... no point. This dull but enjoyable Disney journey, quite living up to the title 'Jungle Cruise', is a real drag to nothing. That's what's most disappointing about the film. What makes it feel like a slow haul is the predictable design to the brim with uninteresting fantasy material and a lame antagonist.And it's seriously not just the villain of the tale who is unexciting; each of the lead heroes, including the characters played by Emily Blunt, Dwayne Johnson and Jack Whitehall, are partially dreary. And cannot rescue how tedious the adventure can get.The main point is that although the acting is strongly satisfactory and its plan missed the target, Jungle Cruise is pretty entertaining. There's no doubt against the fact that the majority of Disney adventure fans will leave pleased and fulfilled after this tale. It doesn't necessarily mean that viewers are best left to experiencing the journey in cinemas, but why not class it as true popcorn fun?If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Jungle Cruise

Delayed due to COVID-19 and released directly to OTT, Jungle Cruise has a good adventure, but the story seemed to lack attraction with loose ends.Johnson's Frank is fun, though. The screenwriters have given him a boatload of cheesy puns as a nod to the theme park ride, and Johnson sells it like he always does. He continues to be very watchable and light, and he and Blunt are clearly having a blast together. Their energy is infectious. Blunt, meanwhile, is wholly wonderful and operating on another level. She is completely and effortlessly at home as Lily is delightful to watch.It is a fine adventure with two genuine movie stars that may very well become a rewatchable staple like the films it references. But on first watch, it mostly comes across as an earnest and safe homage.My Rating : 6/10.",Jungle Cruise

105,galahad58-1,Familiar Cruise,5,2 August 2021,"Disney decided to copy just about every aspect from the Brendon Fraser Mummy movies. Each of the three main characters are identical to the three mains of the Mummy and a bunch of the scene come straight from the Mummy movies.The sad thing is that Johnson cannot act. He is an entertainer who can be good in the right situation, but this isn't one of them. Blunt was flat - very flat - not sure if she was trying too hard to be Rachel Weisz, but it was not her best performance.The action was dull and boring - been there, seen it, and seen it again and again and again.The story just fell apart at the end:
1- The cursed people can go so far from the river before it recalls them. But somehow the Rock gets his former companions into a cave - which by the way - would be closer to the water and imprisons them. That didn't make sense.2- The story tells how the tree blooms every time the moon is at a certain stage. Of course, it happens during this cruise. But it also means that it happens often - so the fight for one petal (from the tree) doesn't make sense since the tree will rebloom as soon as that lunar cycle comes again.3- The German character was such a bad, bad, bad and idiotic presence that was unnecessary - I guess they figured they would add an Indiana Jones moment to the film.4- There was only one way into the tree's home - one way - yet Johnson slams his boat into the opening and seals it. Now, the water is right behind the wreck of the boat so the cursed individuals are still in range of the water (according to the earlier scenes) so that did not make sense. And then with the entrance sealed - how do they get out? If they free the boat then the cursed individuals come back - and without a boat how do they manage to get back to civilization? Did they swim all of those miles?I gave this film a 5 because of the visuals. It is a decent rental film for a mindless adventure night. The story and acting are just terrible though.",Jungle Cruise

Disney did a great job building a strong female character development without making it political. My buddy for and daughters loved it. Which made me happy she came off like a female Indiana Jones she high added to the cleverness of the movie.The cgi characters felt a little like reused pirates of Caribbean 2, but still charming.I was however a bit baffled by the inclusion of things that have been deemed politically incorrect that have been changed on the ride, but are ok for the movie. Not that I thought any of the movie was offensive. Just a curious noteThe only sad part is that the show leaves off with a possibility of sequels, but I doubt Blunt or Johnson have the commitment like Johnny Depp has for continued sequels. I hope I am wrong. And I liked that the rocks ego and big guy tone that is in every movie was downplayed in this movie. He seemed to fit the character more in this movie rather than all his other movies where the character is always built to be a pseudo Rock character.There is so much to like about this movie.

The plot is wafer thin, and padded with so much pointless action it is exhausting. The use 7 cuts minimum to convey a simple scene, sometimes more than 20. It is horrid, like how Wes Anderson does his films now.The jokes do not land, at all. The writing is very poor and they can't make any of the material work. The pacing is rapid fire and the scenes that should be held on to are sped up.The visuals are the worst part of the entire piece, the background looks like poor quality CGI with the characters and foreground stuck on in the cheapest way possible; the same issue they had with 'The Witches'. The Colours and illumination never match up. Neither do the camera angles. Everything is nauseating and ugly. I haven't felt this nauseated since 'Cats' from 2019.Disney sank lower than last year's awful and disgraceful 'Mulan' movie remake. And that says a lot because I hated how that turned out, as did anyone with a functioning brain.Disney has absolutely no idea anymore how to make a movie, let alone write a script; they even lost the technical competency to produce or direct a movie any more. They seem to not know how to do the basic tasks to produce a sequence of scenes that don't look like a disjointed mess.2/10 the worst film I've seen this year, and one of the worst pieces of crap I have ever watched (I gave Mulan last year a 3/10 for much the same issues and they somehow made a worse film.)",Jungle Cruise

There she encounters the foul-mouthed and conniving Captain Frank (Johnson) who swindles his way into becoming their guide and navigator.Their journey to the heart of the Amazon forms the rest of this story with healthy dollops of cannibalistic tribals, undead conquistadors and enchanted beasts.Disney doesn't disappoint, by giving us a fun ride with healthy helpings of humor albeit, without offering any real plotline or sophistication.The Indiana Jones style infusion of history and archaeology is complimented by Disney's superior CGI and animation to give a wondrous end product and perhaps a universe that might spur more sequels.Johnson and Blunt have sparkling chemistry and is ably complimented by a splendid Jack Whitehall in a rib-tickling supporting role,An ideal brainless weekend watch for the entire family.

113,AdrenalinDragon,A decent family Jungle romp,6,8 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise is fine for what it is. A simple kids adventure movie with fun action to it and some decent moments from The Rock and Emily Blunt. It's not trying to be high art or anything special, but gets the job done for kids and families. The special effects look good and there's a good amount of jokes that work. I'd probably pick this over almost all of the Live-Action Disney films honestly. It's an alright watch.6/10.",Jungle Cruise

Nothing feels natural here, this should have been a cartoon. This is a movie that fails to deliver and really disappointing, this will probably be for the kids.",Jungle Cruise

Viewed: August 3rd, 2021When you make a PG film these days, not only do you have to entertain the kids, but you have to remember the older viewers as well. You still want to fill these seats with parents, as well as, with kids. If the parents aren't happy they might not bring their kids anymore. You also need to entertain those older viewers without insulting their intelligence. Thinking you can get something past the kids, that the parents won't notice, doesn't always work. It can hurt the trust between the director and the audience. In the case of Jungle Cruise (2021), director Jaume Collet-Serra tries to weave a tale that works for both, but runs into a couple of issues. These issues are minor and there are still some good bright spots found throughout the film.This is a classic tale that has been seen before, but this one is based off of a Disney theme park ride. I actually had the pleasure of taking the Jungle Cruise, while visiting Disney World back in 2018, so that helped give me some insight into the idea behind this movie. I could relate to the film in some way. By no means, do you need to take the ride, in order to enjoy the film, but it helps. It is that classic jungle adventure film, seen throughout film's ages, which includes action, comedy, romance, evil, danger and all the other ingredients needed for this type of film.Emily Blunt plays Lily Houghton, who is much like a female Indiana Jones, who, along with her brother sidekick Aguirre, are trying to track down a legendary plant that could cure all forms of diseases found in the world. Dwayne Johnson plays the river Captain Frank Wolff, who actually does a nice job portraying the one-lined jokester of a captain. Also in the cast, one of the other reasons why I wanted to see this film, is Frank's competitor in the river business, Nilo (Paul Giamatti), doing what he does best as a loan collecting jerk.As, Frank, Lily and Aguirre make their way through the Amazon they are pursued by a German aristocrat named Joachim, who has his own submarine and also wants the power of the plant for his own uses. The film takes place in 1916, so the writers are playing up the idea that the world is gearing up for WWI. Lily actually expresses to Frank that the plant could help with the war effort, so we know the time-period and what is going on in the world at this time. There also is a plot arc that takes place in the 16th century involving early conquistadors, who also searched for the mythical tree and the fate that comes to those who search for it.There is an underlying feeling throughout the film of familiarity and when I figured it out it didn't bother me too much. You can clearly see a Disney-type template in the film, based off of the Pirates of the Caribbean films (2003-2017). The captain, the tough female lead, the weak sidekick, the political aristocrat, the adversary, a curse, a treasure, a ship, supernatural sea creatures, etc. It works for Jungle Cruise, in the fact that those films were PG-13, which allowed the filmmakers to teeter into the sexual innuendos and under-the-cuff jokes that you can't really do in a PG film so much. It helps Jungle Cruise, because there is an invisible wall in-between our two main characters, that doesn't push the unbelievability of romanticism between the two. It allows the film to concentrate on the film's other positive aspects and have fun being humorous with other sections of the plot.The problems arise when we revisit the kids/parents thing mentioned above. In one early scene in the movie, while Frank and Aguirre are trying to get the boat down the river, while being chased by Nilo's men, they are separated from Lily. Unknown to them, she becomes ensnared in a cage full of birds and is hijacked by pirates to be sold on the black market. As her cage is taken into a building the birds are flying above in the air. Down on the river, the boat takes a turn around a bend and Frank sees the birds circling the building. Frank yells, ""Lily!"". How did Frank know that was Lily in the cage? There must have been a scene/shot that was taken out of the film for time constraints, thinking that the kids won't notice the plot flaw here, but forgot that the adults might notice. That was a major plot flaw. There is no indication that Frank or Aguirre noticed what happened to Lily, but you have to keep the movie rolling along.The other thing that was a hard sell involved Emily Blunt's Lily character. She does a fine job executing the positives of the character into an entertaining performance. It just wasn't a good idea to make her look like a seasoned action-hero. I was having a hard time buying that aspect of her character. Sure, she can be tough! Sure, she can be heroic. She can be smart and carry a gun. She can be all those things. Her sexist nickname from Frank is ""Pants"". Another clever commentary about her character and a reminder of the time period, being the fact that the film still inhabits a period in our history when women didn't wear pants. She is tough, but I felt she showed a fearlessness that was too over-the-top. She also had an agility and fighting prowess that could have been like Jackie Chan's. I couldn't buy that character flaw either.The film does manage to entertain the viewer with plenty of action scenes, stunts, nicely crafted CGI landscapes, smart one-line jokes (intended to be stupid jokes, which makes them better when The Rock says them), colorful characters, a complementing soundtrack and a story that carries you to the end. There are just a few continuity, editing and plot flaw mistakes that brings this film down from being really good. It's still a strong film and one that should be seen in the theaters.7.0 (C MyGrade) = 7 IMDB.",Jungle Cruise

120,FKDZ,Entertaining and well paced family adventure film,7,9 August 2021,"It's not the type of movie I have watched in quite a while. But knowing what I went into I actually enjoyed it a lot. It has a lot of similarities between other Disney adventures, the first one that came to mind for me was the Pirates of the Caribbean, just a bit more friendly.I have to say, Dwayne kicked it out of the park in this movie for me, normally I'm pretty indifferent about him when he's in a film. And it's not like this is a extremely diverse performance, but it just worked out really well. Emily Blunt just as much, though I'm a fan of her already.In regards to authenticity to the Jungle Cruise ride in Disney land, this will be a treat to watch. There's not too much references but the ones that are there are good.The directing is beautiful. Visually this movie was fantastic. The CGI is pretty good overall, measured to Disney standards, though in some parts overused and a bit lacking in realistic animations. There is a ton of CGI in this movie though, so beware.This adventure movie also managed to not make me bored during its 2 hour runtime. Yes... you do have to sit through some of the clichés. But they are short enough that you don't really mind.The script is your typical romantic adventure treasure hunt movie. Fine. But you can predict everything in this movie. The spectacle and visuals made up for it though.Now, there is a bit of ''in your face'' social messaging regarding gender roles, which I thought for the lead actress and her role was fine. Because it had the right payoff. But they shoehorned the romantic preference for the brother. I did not have a payoff, it was just kinda.. there.But all in all, just good old adventurous fun 7/10.",Jungle Cruise

124,gcsman,"Delivers just what you expect, but a sequel might be difficult?",6,7 August 2021,"Disney scored a huge hit with Pirates of the Caribbean (2003), which was vivid, fresh, and insanely clever, and spun it off into a whole franchise. Are they hoping Jungle Cruise will do the same? There are lots of similarities but maybe not ... it's good but not quite at the level of PoC. However, it never lags. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt play nicely off each other, there's lots of engaging action and variety (as long as you don't think too closely about some of it), and it finishes up in the true Disney mold.At the beginning of the third act though, there's a big twist in the plot that utterly changes an important character's identity (no spoilers) and that really doesn't feel right given everything that's happened up to that point. And after that point, the obligatory wind-up action scenes just go on too long into the realm of sensory overload. ""if the only thing happening is relentless physical action, it's a sure sign that no story is being told."" (from Ursula LeGuin.)Still, enough of it is fun and yes it's suitable for the whole family. Enjoy the ride.",Jungle Cruise
125,skullhead739,Cute Disney kids film? Delightfully not.,7,1 September 2021,"This film reminds me greatly of the new Dr dolittle combined with pirates of the Caribbean. It starts seeming immature and average with Dwayne Johnsons character feeling pretty average and typical and the screenplay felt kids like but flips the switch unexpectedly and becomes very interesting.Dwaynes character develops and becomes more likeable and without spoiling feels off and is not normal. The plot picks up and is actually quite scary and creepy definitely not kid friendly. It is very similar to pirates of the Caribbean with these mutated magical decayed people that come after them. Then they have Germans in a sub marine also after them and it's a race against all party's to take a magical item from the Forrest.There is forced romance throughout the movie and it definitely isn't the films strongest asset. The end is quite typical and cheesy but still good with anticipation as they fight for their lives. It was a pleasantly unexpected story that was very fun to watch. It wasn't the best at the start, had a okay romance but overall the story and characters were great. I would definitely recommend this, 7/10 for me.",Jungle Cruise

She finds her challenge not only in the adventurous journey down the river but also in the fearless skipper Frank (Dwayne Johnson), and their witty rivalry becomes more and more intriguing and entertaining over time.Well set villain Prince Joachim (Jesse Plemons) with his German accent and his submarine make the hunt through the Amazonas river even more fun to watch.

128,Spartan_1_1_7,A Decent Adventure Escapism. The Rock and Emily Blunt make a fine Duo.,6,9 August 2021,"Disney's Jungle Cruise is a movie that in some ways feel like it could have come out in the late 90s or early 2000s while, at the same time, is definitely a modern one. In essence, it's a mesh of Pirates of the Caribbean and The Mummy, with the former being the bigger influence. It's nowhere on their level of quality, though, but in the pursuit of that, it does end up being entertaining enough that it is a decent watch. Adventure escapism.The Rock and his charismatic self in the jungle (shocker) with the charming and gorgeous Emily Blunt make a fine duo, easily the strongest part of the movie. They work well off each other. Their banter, them one-upping each other, the eventual romance, it was fun. Add in a side-kick brother extra comic relief character and a cool pet and you get a team that you can certainly get behind in a journey through the Amazon.The villains, though, were lame. Jesse Plemons as the German prince was hilarious at times but they goofed him up too much. Way too cartoony. The discount Captain Barbossa could have been the intense one instilling some much-needed thrills and tension but I guess Disney just doesn't like going there anymore.Visually, the movie can be a looker at times, especially with some creative transitions and cool cinematography. BUT it is also overly reliant on CGI and as an adventure movie trying to mimic those classic ones, it falls way too short in terms of giving you that REAL feel by going on location or having proper massive sets and having a nice blend with CGI. The greenscreen usage is also apparent in several areas taking away from the good shots and giving you that ""ugly"" feeling. The OST wasn't anything special but did the job.The plot is a standard adventure mystery affair. One person is trying to find a mystery, hires a specialist to help them traverse the locale and chaos ensue. A few twists here and there but nothing major or shocking. Still enjoyed the dedication to the adventure vibe. However, I did not like how the movie is 2 hours long and yet it feels as if it's running, perhaps has something to do with the editing because there were far too many cuts. Let moments breathe.All in all, not a bad time if you're looking for an adventure movie. A bit too childish but still enjoyable. And if I were to rate it, I'd give it a 6/10.",Jungle Cruise

131,hoernkeem,"Jungle Cruise (2021, Jaume Collet-Serra) While not amazing this is a fun, vibrant family adventure",6,20 August 2021,"After a year delay due to the COVID pandemic Disney's 'Jungle Cruise' finally hit theaters July 30, 2021. The film stars Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt and costars Edgar Ramirez, Jack Whitehall, Jesse Plemons and Paul Giamatti. The film is directed by Jaume Collet-Serra who has been directing films since 2005 and is branching out with this big budget, potential franchise picture. He has been directing Hollywood movies since 2005 with two very specific themes. He is either helming low budget horror films such as 'House of Wax' and 'Orphan' or he is directing Liam Neesan movies such as 'Unknown' and 'The Commuter'. That is a very odd yet specific wheelhouse. Somehow this landed him on Disney's radar and he must have impressed Johnson because not only did he direct 'Jungle Cruise' but he is directing Johnson's turn as a superhero in DC's 'Black Adam'.In turn of the century London we are introduced to scientist, explorer and troublemaker Dr. Lily Houghton, played by Emily Blunt and her brother MacGregor, played by Jack Whitehall. They are trying to convince the Royal Society to fund an expedition to the Amazon to find a legendary flower known as the Tears of the Moon that can supposedly cure any illness. The Royal Society scoffs at the legend and at the idea that a woman would have the audacity to petition them. Undeterred Lily and her brother set out full of vim and vigor. They encounter buff, and fairly clean riverboat captain Frank Wolf played by Dwayne Johnson. I just imagine a turn of the century Amazon river boat captain being generally on the dirty side. After a lively encounter the three along with Frank's CGI ""murder cat"", as MacGregor calls Frank's pet jaguar, set out to find the legendary flowers. Jessie Plemons plays a German aristocrat who is also on the trail of flowers and wants them for the glory of Germany. Throw into the mix some cursed, ghost conquistadors and you have the recipe for a pretty fun adventure. Along the way many back and forth encounters occur, and we do get one slight twist that was unexpected, but not that mind blowing.This film channels much of the success formula of movies like 'Pirates of the Caribbean', 'National Treasure, and the Indiana Jones series. It has got humor and adventure and some ripe yet wholesome comedy. It is very beautiful and colorful if filled with a bit too much CGI. Some of the CGI really works well. I liked many of the transitions such as the view change from map to river and back, but too much of a good thing gives the viewer the visual version of that sickly sweet feeling. I am not sure I really cared too much about these people or their lives, but I had fun watching this as a flight of fancy. Despite the fact the plot and the action and the premise are all on the ludicrous side you just can just sit back and enjoy it for what it is. Even Jesse Plemons as a duplicitous bad guy was hard not to like because he played a very stereotypical German with his off kilter comedic style. I think certainly Disney would love this brand to catch fire like some other recent forays so they could build a new tentpole series. I am not sure if this will quite have the box office and acclaim to generate a sequel, but if it did spawn one I imagine it would be very similar to this: quite fun, but basically empty headed which isn't necessarily a bad thing in the realm of a Disney live action family friendly adventure.Eric's Grade: C+",Jungle Cruise

I went into this cautiously optimistic and came out feeling underwhelmed and bored. Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt are fine. Their chemistry works sometimes and feels really awkward at others but their script doesn't help. The script leaves a lot to be desired along with the runtime leaves me feeling bored. I found myself checking my watch a lot during the second act because I just didn't care about the characters or what they were doing. The plot tends to take a backseat to explain the backstory of the villains and The Rock's characters but I don't really care about the villains or The Rock's character. There are two villains in this film and while one is completely forgettable the other is only held up by Jesse Plemon's engaging and energetic performance. His character sucks but he definitely helps keep me interested. The action started out fun but got bland and WAY too over reliant on CGI which at points looks really bad. The music felt really bland at points but they have a instrumental rendition of Metallica's Nothing Else Matters which was cool to hear. Towards the end of the film, Emily Blunt's character makes a really awful decision that contradicts what her character wanted and what The Rock's character wanted. As it deals with the end of the film, I won't spoil it but I was very annoyed by it. If you want a turn your brain off kind of movie then this would be perfect for you although don't expect a lot.",Jungle Cruise

That's literally what this movie feels like! And, at a certain point, the plot falls apart on you. There was no chemistry between The Rock and Emily Blount. This is just silly eye candy for kids. The ending was extremely bad. Far too sappy for my tastes. Too many loose ends left behind. This was sloppily written and poorly executed, even for a kids' movie! As is usual in movie trends these days, they bombard you with so much action and dialogue that you lose track of what's going on. That happened to me at several points.

Weird... Then in the middle we get a jarring PSA about sexuality. OK, back to the generic film that I somehow just don't care about despite Emily and Dwayne being among some of my favorite actors. Neither struck me as being particularly engaged in their roles, unfortunately. About the only thing that I found interesting was the villain. Love that guy!Beyond that there is plenty more to find fault with, from editing mistakes, massive plot holes, improbable situations, and oddly some blatant cultural insensitivity because they're still the go-to bad guys?Then the constant yammering about a woman wearing pants? Oh please.The last act was both the best part and the worst of the film. For sure the most interesting, but also unbelievably frustrating because very little made any sense.

They were at once funny, proficient, and entertaining. Blunt and Johnson made an outstanding on-screen pair. Frank's 'true self' (Francisco) reveal took me by utter surprise, I loved it.Paul Giamatti's Nilo (and that parrot of his), Jesse Plemons' Prince Joachim (so casually cruel), and Jack Whitehall's MacGregor Houghton (he brought great balance to the script) were amazing as well.Edgar Ramírez's Aguirre made for an unforgettable villain. The rest of his Jungle-transformed conquistadors - Dani Rovira's Sancho, Quim Gutiérrez's Melchor, and Dan Dargan Carter's Gonzalo - were also excellent. Their VFX designs left nothing out. The lot of them reminded me of Davy Jones and his crew from ""Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest"". Such detailing was worth appreciating.The Jaguar Proxima was a character in her own right. Her CGI was amazing. The lithe jungle cat truly felt alive on screen.Director Jaume Collet-Serra did an amazing job with this title. He adeptly dodged more than a handful of cliché-corners. That took remarkable action-adventure story-telling skill indeed.Screenplay must not be under-estimated for ""Jungle Cruise"". Michael Green, Glenn Ficarra, and John Requa did the story justice by crafting memorable dialogues and captivating, though fictional, 'Amazon Jungle' lore implementations.Flavio Martínez Labiano's cinematography was unwavering in its attention to heart-stopping thrill and mind-numbing excitement.James Newton Howard's musical scoring for this movie proved that the man had not lost his touch.Jean-Vincent Puzos's production design more than 'fit the bill' where ""Jungle Cruise"" was concerned. On a similar note, the art direction team and Larry Dias's set decoration skills also did good by this project. Paco Delgado's costume design was eye-opening and inspired. The VFX and special effects teams brought some of their best work to bear on ""Jungle Cruise"" movie.A major shout-out to the stunts department for making several sequences credible and heart-wrenchingly good.I'm breathing a sigh of relief knowing they didn't actually shoot the film in The Amazon rainforest. The place needs all the aid and attention it can get, given the ongoing carbon-sink and climate-crisis issues that are plaguing it, no thanks to Brazil's Bolsanaro. ""Jungle Cruise"" was filmed in Hawaii and Kaua'I (one of its main islands), as well as in North America. These location choices truly made the film appear stunning and realistic in parallel.The movie was definitely worth the wait, and the expense, to catch it on Amazon Prime Video, a mere day before it released in theatres in my city. In my defence, tickets were sold out and I simply refused to wait a day longer.",Jungle Cruise

That must have been hard to achieve.Unlike The Mummy, our couple here has literally no chemistry, and The rock has chemistry with almost anyone.And one more thing: the latest attempt of Disney at ""female power"" narrative turns into LGBTQ bashing.

I watch movies like this for a little escapism.Your fam will probably enjoy iy though. It is a bit longer than it needed to be.

The project was a labor of love for Walt Disney and has thrilled millions of guests with the scenic cruise, animated animals, and the cringe-worthy puns and jokes from the captains who have made it an enduring legend.Since attractions ranging from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"", ""The Haunted Mansion"" and ""The Tower of Terror"" have made their way to screens along with others over the years; it was not much of a shock to hear that The Jungle Cruise was next in line to make the leap to the big screen. Despite several release date changes and then a lengthy delay due to Covid; the film has finally arrived backed by a star-studded premiere at Disneyland.When Doctor Lilly Houghton (Emily Blunt) with the help of her high-maintenance brother MacGregor (Jack Whitehall) desire to find a mythical item and gain entry into a prestigious organization; they are hampered by the sexist views of early 1900 England and forced to steal an artifact and race to the Amazon.With a dangerous foreigner; Prince Joachim Jesse Plemons and his goons in hot pursuit, Lilly and her brother find themselves in the company of a boat captain named Frank (Dwayne Johnson); who in dire need of money uses all sorts of methods to gain a charter and take Lilly and her brother into a dangerous area.Along the way, all manner of humor, action, and dangers arise as everything from hostile natives, animals, rapids, and of course, The Prince stands in their way. If this was not bad enough; there is also a matter of a curse that must be factored in which presents an even bigger danger than before.In a race against time, Frank and Lilly must learn to trust and work with one another and decipher the clues to save the day and keep the forces of evil from winning.The film takes a bit of time to get going as while there is some action and great scenery and sets; early on it does seem to be unsure of what type of film it wants to be and what type of story it wants to tell.Is it a madcap adventure with a dash of romance? Is it an FX-laden action spoof? Perhaps it is an over-the-top action film that recalls the fabled cinematic adventures of old?In reality, the film is a combination of all of the above. I had flashes of ""The African Queen"", ""Romancing the Stone"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Pirates of The Caribbean"", and ""The Mummy"" during the film.While the MacGuffin element of the film may be a bit confusing for some with more questions than answers; Blunt and Johnson work very well with one another and Whitehall provides a wider element to his character making him more than the comic relief in the film.The FX are very enjoyable and the film mixes the humor with the action well including some of the best jokes from the attraction.While it may at first glance be considered just a routine adventure film; the movie blends a strong and enjoyable cast with a fun adventure that recalls the thrilling cinematic tales of old but does so with a fresh and modern twist.4 stars out of 5.",Jungle Cruise

It's fiction!The other thing, yeah there are great adventure films but who only wants to watch 2/3 classic films ever because they're great?

The music is standout, but what does not work in this films favour is the length of the movie itself and the chemistry between the two leads. You simply cant believe there is any real chemistry between the two. Heck, Jack Whitehall had more chemistry with the big cat in the film than Blunt and Johnson.

The plot is pretty dull and nothing new or inventive which is what lets the movie down slightly but the casting and actors performances are what make it fun, the comedy with the rock and Jack Whitehall was really funny and made me laugh way more than it should have with how cheesy the jokes are. The effects were hit and miss, some looked amazing and some of the wide shots were fantastic and then some bits just looked dark and impossible to understand what was going on.

Despite it's flaws Jungle Cruise is still a fun film that your whole family will enjoy.",Jungle Cruise
166,MovieWarfare,A fun adventure movie with a messy plot,6,29 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise (2021) is another attempt at making a movie franchise based on one of their rides at their theme parks. The only real success so far has been Pirates of the Caribbean. Most of the time it is Tomorrowland (2015) or The Haunted Mansion (2003). The premise is ""Dr Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) enlists the aid of wisecracking skipper Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson) to take her down the Amazon in his ramshackle boat. Together, they search for an ancient tree that holds the power to heal -- a discovery that will change the future of medicine"". So is this more close to Pirates of the Caribbean or Tomorrowland?Firstly, Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt truly carry this film. Dwayne's scoundrel and charismatic performance surprisingly works well with Emily's posh and outgoing performance. Both have great chemistry together and when they are both bantering with one another, it is enjoyable to watch. The majority of the movie is about the characters on the boat which is what the ride is about. So I do appreciate the fact that they did attempt to keep it faithful to the ride it was inspired by.Jungle Cruise feels like a 90s movie but that is not quite a bad thing in this case. It is advertised as a fun family adventure movie and I do believe it succeeds in that aspect. There are some silly but fun jokes that mostly land and there are over the top action sequences that are fun to watch. We get the 90s comic relief guy and even over the top villains as well. For the most part, it does feel old fashioned but it works and I can definitely see families enjoying Jungle Cruise. There are also some really nice twists and revelations that genuinely surprised me as well.However, the plot is a bit messy in its execution. For example, it takes quite a while for the Jungle Cruise to actually start and even when it has finally started, there is a lot of downtimes that don't advance the plot. The film's length is over 2 hours and it feels way too long. The movie could have easily cut 15-20 minutes of runtime and made it a better film, pacing wise. Dwayne's character, Frank Wolff, is the cliche cynical and shrewd character who is initially unlikeable but gets better later. Jungle Cruise takes almost over halfway in the movie before he actually becomes likeable which was way too long in my opinion. Jungle Cruise also has a villain problem as there are two villains in this film. Aguirre, the cursed Spanish conquistador, who wanted the tree's power to save his daughter but is now immortal and Prince Joachim who is some german guy. Both are chasing the protagonist but Prince Joachim himself feels like a giant waste of screen time even though he appears more than Aguirre. You could cut Prince Joachim and the plot is still the same, that is how irrelevant his character is.Jungle Cruise (2021) has an abundant amount of CGI. It feels like CGI was the first solution to everything by the director and it shows. It wouldn't be as jarring if the CGI itself was good. Unfortunately, this is not the case as the CGI is very noticeable and not great by 2021 standards. The shots, editing and cinematography are also disappointing average and never feel like it tries to do more with it despite it being a big blockbuster. However, the music score by James Newton Howard has got to be the most disappointing aspect of Jungle Cruise. James has done scores for many great films such as King Kong (2005), Unbreakable (2000), Fantastic Beast franchise etc. For some reason, James gives a very weak score for Jungle Cruise (2021). There is no soundtrack here that sticks in my mind and it has no iconic theme like Pirates of the Caribbean.Overall, Jungle Cruise is a fun action and adventure film that is reminiscent of classic 90s films such as The Mummy (1999) but never as good. Thanks to the chemistry of Dwayne and Emily, the Jungle Cruise manages to stay afloat to keep you engaged but it certainly ends up being a very generic and forgettable movie. Nevertheless, it is better than a lot of Disney's previous outings that were based on theme park rides. Not as good as Pirates of the Caribbean but better than Tomorrowland which is a huge step forward.",Jungle Cruise
167,Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,Jungle Cruise Sails Through Choppy Waters,8,30 July 2021,"Bon voyage, Streamers! Another weekend, another option from that media conglomerate Disney! The latest adaptation of Disneyland ride into a big budget movie is Jungle Cruise, premiering in theaters and on Disney+ with Premier Access. Disney had great success with the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, which was maybe the first film adaptation of a theme park ride; and it was buoyed by spectacular effects including the daffy, virtuosic performance from Johnny Depp. Why not try again, right? In a sense, it would seem like a movie based on a theme park ride would need an over-the-top hook like a Depp performance to make it work, but Jungle Cruise has The Rock and Mary Poppins 2.0, so... Anyway, here's how Jungle Cruise fared in its waters.I've never been on the Jungle Cruise ride, so I have no idea if there is a storyline there. I'm going to assume there is not, so the screenwriters had to develop a plot to get the characters on an boat in the jungle and stuff happening. The basics of the plot are that Dr. Lily Houghton (Blunt), a brilliant and adventurous scientist ignored in the science community because she is a woman in the early 20th century, sets out to find an elusive tree with healing powers in the heart of the Amazon. Reluctantly accompanied by her younger brother, McGregor (Jack Whitehall), Lily determined with her wits and an ancient artifact believes she can locate the tree and survive the foray into the jungle. Lily and McGregor engage the services of a riverboat man, Frank (Johnson), who has secrets of his own, to get them deep into the jungle. All the while, mysterious strangers and nefarious villain lurk in the recesses of the jungle threatening to derail Lily's quest. Hijinks, puns, and CGI ensue.Look, the story is ridiculous, but it's a Disney movie. It reminds me of the quest to harness Vibranium from Blank Panther. Everything is so broad and vaguely sketched. The villains are evil for evil-sake - there's no definable motivation or characteristic, except that they are bad guys. It does take too long for the Lily, McGregor and Frank to get on the river and on with their quest. I can see a viewer getting a little bored about 20 minutes in. The movie does pick up when some cool special effects show up and inject some energy into the story. Once you get to that point, it should be smooth sailing to the end.On the positive side, Johnson and Blunt are a good big screen pair. They have good chemistry, even if the relationship is ridiculous. Blunt has that easy charm she carries in every role. She's believable as a plucky and headstrong scientist. It's easy to root for her. Johnson has charisma for days. Even though he is saddled with some groan-inducing one-liners and puns, he sells them the best he can and maintains his cool. I'll also shout out Jack Whitehall. He does a great job of keeping up with his superstar co-stars and even steals a scene or two. While I think the CGI is great, it overpowers anything from Edgar Ramirez and what's worse is that is steals from Pirates of the Caribbean without adding anything special. Nevertheless, the production design and magnificent set pieces are a great reason to see this movie.Jungle Cruise is a fun, summer Disney popcorn flick. It has issues with its plot and pacing early on, but it gains steam as it sails along. Blunt and Johnson do a great job of keeping the movie light and entertaining. Even though the story is ridiculous, you at least root for the characters and can get lost in the special effects, sets and costumes. I wouldn't run out to see Jungle Cruise, but a Saturday matinee with a bowl of popcorn, especially with the family, could be fun.",Jungle Cruise
168,Mccadoo,Good old fashioned popcorn movie,9,2 August 2021,"My wife and I were looking for a good action movie for our ""movie night'' and at first I was reluctant to pay for this movie but in the end I did and I'm very glad of it.Jungle Cruise is something we don't get much of these days from Hollywood and especially from Disney; a simple fun and entertaining movie that doesn't try to shove a political agenda down your throat. We need more of these kinds of films because they are what most people are sorely missing these days; a check you troubles at the door adventure film that entertains for a few hours then goes away. It's a niche that superhero movies used to fill. Before they became agenda driven drivel that are less interested in entertaining and more interested in indoctrinating.Jungle Cruise is simply a fun ride (pun intended) for the entire family. Johnson and Blunt have great chemistry which I must admit surprised me at first. Johnson is his usual likable self=depreciating self who can be a badass when needed. And Blunt is perfect as the female adventurer with a mind of her own and a real talent for taunting Johnson's character. They play off of one another extremely well. I think that was the key to the movie being so good.Is this a deep and thought provoking film? Of course it isn't. And anyway, if you're looking to movies these days for deep and thought provoking messages you're in real trouble! This is a fun night-at-the-movies movie that will keep you interested and make you smile for a few hours...isn't that all that movies were ever supposed to do? Don't over analyze it, just watch it and enjoy the ride!",Jungle Cruise
169,RetroRick,"Great visuals, good leads, especially Blunt",7,2 August 2021,"Likeable, light-weight adventure movie in a traditional mode. Dwayne Johnson is likeable as ever but it's Blunt who provides the stand-out character. The latter looks at first like she's going to be another Mary-Sue sort, and to an extent she is, but it's a credit to both Blunt & the writers that she ends up being arguably the most animated and believable character, both an unstoppable force and vulnerable in turns.The implied but - as is de rigeur these days - not quite achieved - romance between the leads seems slightly clunky in its rendering, even more so when the nature of the story plays out (age-gaps are always a bit controversial aren't they?) but they're both so likeable no-one really cares. Jack Whitehall also pulls off his role as a slightly braver than Bertie Wooster type fop with aplomb & it's hard not to think that he won't be becoming an even bigger name in the future on the basis of his screen presence here.The main demerit is probably just the fact of the film's inherent - and no doubt intended limitations. I'm not a fan of the supernatural element in adventure films, so I've tended to avoid unashamedly fantastical films like the Mummy or Pirates of the Carribean preferring your traditional Indiana Jones types say over the slightly sillier Last Crusade for example. This film starts out more like the first couple of Indiana Jones movies but then the supernatural element hits us.Most people will probably be fine with that, but to my mind it would have made for a better adventure if hadn't ventured off into the fantastic. It doesn't really matter, it's still great fun, if slightly less than the sum of its parts in the final reckoning.Credit should also go to Jessie Plemon's evil but not that evil German Prince, whose restrained villainy is amplified mainly by the simple fact he's a first world war era German keen on establishing some kind of enduring Reich. Plemon's is fun to watch, not least perhaps because his whole character, devious but bounded by honour, seems to have been based on the German prince who kidnaps series 2 Lord BlackAdder (slightly obscure but influence was tangible)But even that is over-analysing, just switch off and enjoy.",Jungle Cruise

Director Jaume Collet-Serra presented this adventure in such a way that in every other scene we see we try to connect it with a movie we have watched before. Clearly the word jungle has enough predecessors but the main thing we remember while watching this film is Jack Sparrow and his adventures. Dwayne Johnson has also given a fun and enjoyable performance. When it comes to pacing, even though the runtime is almost two hours it feels very fast paced. Editing and transitions needed more attention to it. The story isn't something really extraordinary or very good but if we see it totally then it's enjoyable.

Chemistry between DJ & Emily was pretty much perfect minus the overuse of the word ""lady"". The film had me reminiscing other films such as POTC & The Mummy. However, the film lagged at times causing it to feel a slight bit too long. Overall, enjoyable- would recommend watching, especially in theatres.(My Ratings)
Overall: 90/100
IMDb: 9/10
Letterboxd: 4.5/5The Review....
If you were to ask my family & friends if I laugh a lot. They would more than likely say 'no'. However, this movie lightened me up to the point of not being able to contain my laughter. It didn't take long for the jokes to start, and though they were ""dad jokes"", I very much enjoyed them.Chemistry between DJ & Emily was surprisingly great. I wasn't sure how to feel about the pairing at first, but they worked well off one another. The only thing I didn't care for was that DJ went from calling his female co-stars in ""Fast and Furious"" 'woman' to 'lady'. It got old quick, but it still works out in the end.It was truly hard to not reminisce about other movies in ""Jungle Cruise"". The constant ""hey lady"" had me remembering ""The Mummy"" with Brandon Fraser, the Conquistadors reminded me of ""POTC"", and the water draining had my sister remembering the second ""National Treasure"" movie. Although this film pulled from other films, I'm sure, it still had somewhat of an original feel.This is part enjoyable and part gripe. I could be wrong, but most if not all the film felt like it was done in front of blue or green screen, and so the lack of ""sets"" didn't give it a true adventure feel, however, the animation wasn't terrible and at parts it was believable depending on the scene.Lastly, the only other real gripe was that pace was good for about 95% of the film. That last 5% kind of lags after a good laugh, or a high action scene, thus making the film feel a bit too long. Again, it was still an enjoyable watch.",Jungle Cruise

If they cut the massive backstories and intricate details and this flick would be a real winner.Other than that this is a fun ride that will please most moviegoers looking for a few laughs and some light entertainment.I can be a pretty curmudgeonly about Disney junk but even I had a great time.

180,mikecanmaybee,Too Long,2,21 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise is over 2 hours of relentless so called action with 1000 groan inducing quips by the Rock that get quite tiresome after the first half hour. It morphs from an action flick into some sort of weird Sci-Fi about an hour and a half in with something about snakes. Jungle cruise should have been edited down to a hour and twenty, but what we have is a terribly Long, unhinged, sack of Amazon feces.

You can see these special effects in both locations and characters. I liked the background music and sound effects.The acting crew was well-chosen. Dwayne Johnson, Emily Blunt, and Jesse Plemons were awesome in their roles. You see a wide variety of different locations in the movie. Locations like the jungle, river, cave, town, etc. I saw a lot of nice action scenes. My favorite scene was escaping with the boat from the harbor.

Cliche characters and predictable ending with a couple of twists here and there, along with some great humor and punchlines, wonderfully delivered by the Rock who does an excellent job as ""Frankie"" and a great case of Emily Blunt as the relentless semi-attractive explorer.Great acting all-around and great scenery capture (CGI = OK) will make this a fun viewing for everyone, on the flip side it's not as good as Inidiana Jones or the PoC, however if you need to choose one new family movie this summer, this should be on the top of your list.Exact score: 77 / 100.",Jungle Cruise

187,thegulls1,"Charming Performances from the Rock & Emily, but...",5,31 July 2021,".. there are script problems. Tried to squeeze too many 'Disney Ride' concepts into the film, I guess. The Rock was BORN to play that role, but the CGI and weirdo effects and creatures detracted from his work.We saw it as the first feature of a drive-in double-feature, and, to be honest, if it had been the second one, we would have departed as soon as the plot became entangled with haunted legends and creatures. An old drive-in movie screen hardly does credit to the favourable special effects anyway--see it at a Dolby theatre, or wait until you can see it on your own HI-DEF screen at your home theatre.This, I guess, is the challenge Movie Companies face these days: lure folks to the Big Screen to be dazzled.

Forcing a classic ride to be a movie without good writing was a recipe for disaster. The story sucks. Chemistry is lacking. Paul Giamatti's character was unduly minimized. Villains were lackluster. Go back to stories and don't worry about casting mega stars Disney.",Jungle Cruise
196,HollisWoods,"Fun Dwayne Johnson movie, but -",7,2 August 2021,"As far as ""movies based on attractions"" go, the only thing I could compare Jungle Cruise to is Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl. And that first Pirates movie had the right cast, right story, right music, right everything. This made it so hard for Jungle Cruise to even compete. Even without comparing the two movies, Jungle Cruise on its own just doesn't stand out. However I do have to praise it for the originality and it's effort to present a new story. The costuming was well done too, the character designs of the cursed people were cool, and James Newton Howard once again presents an epic soundtrack for me to nerd over. I'll tell you, my favorite scene, hands down, was when the epic instrumental cover of Nothing Else Matters blared over Frank's origin story flashback. The story told paired with this music was honestly the best part of the movie.So not everything was bad, but I'll continue complaining before I give the film more praise. I'm a female in the LGBT community, so don't get mad when I say the feminism and gay pride messages were too on the nose for me. Now I get the time period and how women were seen. But I didn't have to be reminded that Lily was wearing pants every other scene. And the whole concept of girl power was thrown in our faces way too much, which seems to happening a lot in film these days. Again, comparing this to Pirates, Elizabeth Swan definitely wore pants a couple times. But nobody made consistent comments about it, and Elizabeth was naturally presented as a strong woman as the main trilogy progressed. No one batted an eye to see her in sword fights, but if Lily does anything it's ""gasp how could a lady behave this way.""Now MacGregor as a gay character was presented more naturally, I would say. I didn't exactly pick up that he was gay until further in the movie, but it was totally believable when I did realize. I think his character arc overall was well written and I like how he developed throughout. However, I just have a hard time wrapping my head around the fact that Frank would ridicule Lily wearing pants every five minutes, but completely accepts MacGregor coming out to him in that one scene. Frank's two different outlooks here just don't match, and I saw that scene more as a way of Disney telling fans directly, ""yeah he's gay because here at Disney, we support gay people."" It just really took the overall meaning of what that scene could've had.The last thing I'll complain about is the stupid romance. It was way too rushed, way too predictable, and honestly not effective. I would've loved it way more if the two became chaotic best friends and partners in crime. Frank's sacrifice in the end would've had a more emotional impact for me if it was Lily crying over the loss of her BFF rather than a sudden lover. I loved Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson together on screen. However, the romance was a big miss, and just made me roll my eyes.Speaking of the Rock, are Dwayne Johnson movies their own genre? Because I would never ever watch Jungle Cruise on it's own, but if I planned on watching one or two of Dwayne's movies, I might slide Jungle Cruise in for a mini marathon. With Dwayne Johnson movies, you pretty much get the same fun, action experience with Dwayne being super cool and occasionally funny. Not that it's bad that his movies seem the same to me. I enjoy all his movies for the most part. And Jungle Cruise is just another Rock experience.Circling back to the original story, I think it's awesome how Disney once again invented a whole adventure to a ride that didn't really have one. Even if it's not as good as Pirates, they still accomplished this. I also loved the nods to the original ride. The actual attraction really is all about the skipper & any dad jokes they can throw to the guests throughout the attraction. Jungle Cruise really was packed with corny jokes and did it's best with comedic moments, and I feel that truly captured and glorified the true spirit of the attraction. Also loved the appearance of Trader Sam. You can visit Trader Sam's bar at Walt Disney World's Polynesian resort. Makes me wonder what other little Easter eggs and lore I missed. Also loved the part when her and MacGregor were lifted by the submarine, and Trader Sam just dipped and left MacGregor to his fate. I laughed way too hard at that.So yeah. Overall, fun Dwayne Johnson movie, but could've been better.",Jungle Cruise
197,mocaler,Enjoyable except for the plot,6,31 July 2021,"The visually were good and the acting was enjoyable, except for the over the top main protagonist. Basing the story on characters undertaking a dangerous journey based on a myth was a thin premise and done too many times before. Adding supernatural elements was silly. I wasn't a fan of the amount of alcohol consumption portrayed in it, especially since this is supposed to be a kid friendly movie. It was not a good message. Also, the whole myth aspect weren't good messages either. Added to that was the steeling by the supposedly good people. I actually feel that this movie has a lot of things which are bad for kids to see in the portrayed positivity. That being said, I do like how the gay reference was done in a Disney film, although I would have liked it better if the guy was portrayed as more competent. His character at least developed during the film. I liked how they critiqued the sexism of the time and had the female lead be a strong character.",Jungle Cruise

This is that film. (Oddly, another in this line is Mary Poppins II, also with Emily Blunt.)There are too many obvious villains given nothing original to say. Staged scenes look staged. The romantic twinkle comes to our love duo exactly on time. The self-outed gay brother is given little more to do than be picky about his wardrobe, his cosmetics, and his tea, while late in the film he suddenly becomes a prize boxer with near superhero skills (perhaps the scriptwriter was doing penance for the earlier stereotypes).The leads took this mess and made something of it. They were funny. They were fun. They clicked. They Made It All Work.Thank them. Don't thank the screenwriter(s). I counted 1,128 different parallel plot lines all configured to close in on each other about 20 minutes before the film's end. Thankfully, 704 were resolved.I forgot. The CGI.

But this is really by-the-by, Jungle Cruise is an enormously enjoyable Disney adventure flick and its nice to see Disney portraying a character who is subtly hinted to be LGBT.Possibly down to the Worldwide Pandemic thus far Jungle Cruise hasnt perhaps been the smash-out-of-the-park blockbuster hit it might have been Pre-covid, but Disney is more often than not great at this type of flick and gets two thumbs up from me.",Jungle Cruise

Dwayne Johnson is as charming as ever, and assisting him are the company of Emily Blunt and Jack Whitehall. Blunt has been apparently finding her path in Hollywood with well-crafted popcorn entertainment and more thoughtful films like A Quiet Place; I certainly hope she continues to go down this path of success.By the way, if Metallica was going to license 'Nothing Else Matters' to any composer to cover it for a Disney picture, Jungle Cruise definitely makes the most sense.Grade- 3/4 stars.",Jungle Cruise

Competency is present in this film but without heart, it all rings hollow.On a technical level, the verdict is the same. The shot selection is adequate without being unique or interesting. The rugged production design is good but undercut by the sterile CGI (which is grossly over-used). The soundtrack is fitting yet forgettable. And the editing does little to impact the experience in a meaningful way. Ultimately, Jungle Cruise takes proven elements of other movies without providing anything new of its own, leaving audiences to accept it as a decent production but forget it as soon as it's over.Writing: 4/10

231,Entertainmentsparadise,Funky Expedition,5,10 August 2021,"Join the voyage as Dr. Lily Houghton and tour guide Frank Wolff expedite a journey to find an ancient treasure.With the cheesy comical appeal of Frank Wollf ( Dwayne The Rock Johnson), an easy to follow yet effective plot, and the hint of a true love story, Jungle Cruise proves to be your typical Live Action Disney excursion.Overall this is a very fun film with moderate pacing mixed with some PG action. The easy going nature of the plot makes for a happily ever after ending. The casting is put together well, and the plot could be seen as boring yet Disney did an effective job of countering that by giving the viewer more. More comical scenes- allowing The Rock to be The Rock. A plot twist towards the end of the film-who is this Frank Wolf? Which leads to a deeper meaning behind the story and the love aspect- unexpected.If you are looking to watch a fun easy going film with (typical Disney Live Action) and you have a full house ready to spend $30 on movie night then this is for you. It may be worth it for a good time and a long time... its 2 hours but felt so much longer than that. If you want more action and a deeper plot like the 'Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of Black Pearl ) this isn't for you.",Jungle Cruise
232,supermellowcali,Great for kids,6,31 July 2021,"Not much to be said on this one... very silly story, in similar fashion Pirates of the Caribbean, well done but nothing special. Good for a young audience but probably not for ages over 12 or so.",Jungle Cruise
233,shawthingproductions,Even the kids were bored.,1,1 August 2021,"I don't know what Disney was thinking with this. They clearly didn't have much confidence in the product themselves given how the special effects look (cheap and nasty). Even the actors, normally good, seem to be on ""cruise"" mode. I'm almost embarrassed for Dwayne and the costume they had him wear.The jokes do not land, even with the kids. The plot is thinner than a piece of paper. In fact, I will go so far as to say this film has zero redeeming factors about it whatsoever.",Jungle Cruise
234,alexglimbergwindh,Average is best,6,8 August 2021,Loved the first act. Great casting with the only decent would be the rock.Then the movie turned into a weird mix of pirates if the Caribbean and the lack of color grading didn't help with my visual experience.,Jungle Cruise
235,661jda,Summer is starting on 7/29,7,30 July 2021,"This is a great movie if you're 10-16 years old. It's still good for others, but it gets old fast. Johnson and Blunt make an unlikely, but likeable couple and hold the show together relatively well. With this film, Blunt proves she can master anything: historical drama, comedy, adventure, just anything. But the real gem is Jack Whitehall as her brother. He plays the token gay character - a little trite, but he is funny in his own right and plays well with the rest of the cast. The only thing that I can really complain about is the villain who isn't really that villainous at all. One thing though -- If you're going to see it (and I think you should), go see it at the movies where you can sit with your bucket of popcorn and coke and enjoy the scope of the picture as it should be seen.",Jungle Cruise
236,Golightly678,"So Disney, it's boring",5,4 October 2021,"TL;DR: Got bored. Knew it wouldn't get better, not wasting more time. Cast was fine. Direction was something else entirely.Long version:I grew up in love w pirates of the Caribbean and Swiss family Robinson and i loved both at the parks and loved the movies more as an adult. I have loved most of what Disney makes from the very beginning. Gave credit to movies i didn't personally like but saw the quality in them still. So i was surprised i actually couldn't stand this from the very beginning.The brief moments of funny were so heavy handed i couldn't enjoy it fully. The story is nothing I'm familiar with but that doesn't matter if the movie can't stand on its own. The whole thing was way too saccharin for us. Just everything about it. It was obviously made for kids, fine, per usual. But this is way over the top in some way. I can likely guess it's the Direction. Disney might be trying to form a new method. I've noticed this a few times over the years. This didn't time it didn't work for us.",Jungle Cruise

Despite that, I enjoyed it. Emily Blunt (Lily Houghton aka Pants) and Dwayne Johnson (Frank aka Skippy) had undeniable chemistry. The movie was light-hearted, fun, and worth 2 hours of a lazy day. I hold one entire star back because the plot has too many goofs and while they've used a repetitive storyline, justice was not done.The movie could have been much better, it did have a scope, but well, they had their chance.",Jungle Cruise

We have seen too many instances of cities and treasures coming out of waterfalls. But Emily Blunt is good and more than her chemistry with Dwayne Johnson its her relation with her brother which I found appealing. Its not a bad film its just nothing original there. I have done the ride in Orlando many years ago. Dora and the city of Gold is also on similar lines and I found that more exciting and well made. This movie needed more thrills and plotting but its a decent watch.",Jungle Cruise
248,benjaminskylerhill,Fun and fleeting.,6,1 August 2021,"It's overstuffed with too many characters, subplots, and exposition dumps; but that doesn't stop it from flaunting it's abundance of personality and charisma!It's briskly paced enough, witty enough, and well-acted enough to keep one engaged throughout its entirety, and they give the characters just enough development to give the action sufficient stakes so that it rarely drags.Predictable as it may be, it's quite a bit of fun. It does it's job plenty well, even if it is an absurd adventure based on a theme park ride.",Jungle Cruise
249,filmbuff-05706,Worth A Disney Plus Watch.,8,6 August 2021,"As we all know, Disney has been a bit unoriginal for Disney standards. Remaking their classics(or having a spin off), sequels, and the like have been abundant in Disney, and other companies too.With the knowledge that Jungle Cruise is a Disney World ride like Pirates of the Caribbean, I went into this with both excitement and doubts. That said, Jungle Cruise was a worthy trip to the theater.The plot is headed by Emily Blunt(who was the titular character in Mary Poppins Returns) playing Lily, who is in search of a tree who's petals have the power to heal- making for a medical revolution. Along the way, she meets a jungle tour guide named Frank, played by Dwayne Johnson. After a deal, they work together to find the treasure.There is much to admire about Jungle Cruise, such as the cast. It also includes Paul Giamatti, and Disney Channel star Rapheal Alejandro had a couple of scenes. Even though I don't watch much of his work I must report that I perked up when he appeared.The cinematography is also well done, and very pleasing to look at. Some of it looked very real, even though some of it surely wasn't.Frank also tells many puns in the movie, most of which are in his first scene, in an attempt to amuse his tour guide attendants. To paraphrase one of them: ""I had a cross eyed girlfriend once. We could never see eye to eye."" As a lover of puns and corny jokes, they made me laugh hard.There are other funny bits as well, though this by definition is not a comedy. One line in the final scene made me and a friend crack up kind of obnoxiously and we quoted it a couple of times. I won't spoil that one, but Emily Blunt says it and it's a pun on profanity.Despite the joys Jungle Cruise offers, it did have it's criticisms. I mentioned the lack of orginality, though as someone who went to Disney World just once 13 years ago, that alone didn't bother me.While nothing really needed to be taken out, there were some moments that seemed to slow down the movie and sway my interest. I can't think of how I would change these moments, but I did feel antsy when this notion occurred.I did very much enjoy Jungle Cruise as a theatrical experience(Thanks to the pandemic, I haven't seen a movie on the Big Screen since Toy Story 4), but as for my recommendation for others, I would only suggest it for theatrical viewing or as a part of a Disney Plus subscription. I would not rush to buy it for a $20 DVD or $25 Blu-ray before doing either first. (I may own this but I am in no rush as of now.)That noted, with all things said and done, Jungle Cruise is a worthy watch despite it's shortcomings and is worth the ""ride"" either way.Note To Parents: While not too violent, please note the PG-13 rating before taking the really little ones to see this. It may be a little too intense in some areas.*If you enjoy this, please check out and (positively) vote on my other reviews by clicking on filmbuff-05706. I'd greatly appreciate it, dear reader! :)",Jungle Cruise
250,loganwmedia,Jungle Cruise,3,21 August 2021,"It channels influence from ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and others to the point of mimicry, and has trouble exercising its own imagination. As a result, I did not find it to be very entertaining. Jesse Plemons talks to a bee, though - that was fun.",Jungle Cruise
251,vader1948,Awesome !,10,30 July 2021,What a fun action fantasy movie! It moves right along and definitely brings fond memories to all of us who have a Disney heart. This adventure is right out of our imaginations as we have always wanted things to be. A sure fire story lends to the action so well I was really pleased with it. Well done to the screen writers who took a simple amusement ride and created a whole world of excitement and thrills out of it. Dwayne and Emily were great perfect casting for this genre. 👍🏻,Jungle Cruise
252,fonnyhariyanto,good disney's adventure movie,9,17 August 2021,"Simple words, love it because it was funny, entertaining, good cgi effects, very good acts from all the cast. This movie looks like a mix of indiana jones and pirates of the carribean movies. I'll wait for the sequel.",Jungle Cruise
253,tarekali-19909,excellent must watch film,9,4 August 2021,"It has been a while since we had such fun watching a family film together. Jungle cruise has 2 of my favourite actors - Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt - who deliver smashing performances. Their on-screen chemistry is brilliant, and they display their individual passions clearly and credibly. There's a sweet love story here. The villain of the movie hearkens back to the moustache-twirling days of yore, with a ruthlessly driven mind played brilliantly by Jesse Plemons.The dialogue of the film is witty and entertaining, and remarkably sophisticated, tackling sensitive issues with taste and class. The special effects and settings are authentic and really well done. Set pieces are magnificent and breathtaking. You can almost feel the steamy heat of the Amazon in each scene. The supernatural aspect is a nice welcome twist, always. Just like the Pirates franchise, Disney really knows how to spin off classic theme park rides into excellent movies. The jungle cruise within cruise was a funny meta twist.There's a massive twist half way through the movie that absolutely nobody saw coming, which really changes the perspective on a major character. Bravo script writers. The soundtrack by James Newton Howard is epic in scale, reminiscent of earlier classic adventure films. This is an excellent must watch film.",Jungle Cruise
254,atj-19320,Cliche,7,6 August 2021,"Very typical and cliche Disney movie, nothing too fresh really, just all felt really familiar. The dialogues, the action sequences, what happens next, cinematography, forced romantic feelings shown, a useless kiss scene...literally all the same formula. Besides visuals and atmosphere, it's not the best. It also felt really dragged on, definitely could've shortened the run time. One time watch at best with family. Mainly watchable for visuals and family audiences.",Jungle Cruise
255,vadim-berman,"Ignore the critics, it's an OK movie",7,1 August 2021,"I miss the 1980s simple, brainless entertainment. Jungle Cruise is just that: budget Indiana Jones mixed with Pirates of the Caribbean and a couple of twists along the way. Which is a good enough reason for me to see the movie.It is not a masterpiece and it does not have to be.Turn off your brain, relax, and enjoy the ride.",Jungle Cruise
256,thokocnamangale,Surprisingly impressive,7,31 July 2021,"I haven't seen a movie like it in a long time. I didn't have high expectations heading into the movie, I thought it'd end up a cliche movie with some sort of jumanji homage; that or Edge Of The World. However, it is a very fun adventure film despite the plot being a bit trite but everything else is done well and it makes up for it. The casting was great and it was good to see Jack Whitehall get a big break in a movie. Dwayne Johnson and Emily blunt's played their roles very well.I thought it'd be more of a historical adventure film, so I was a bit skeptical when they brought some magic in but it worked just fine, it's Disney I don't know why I was surprised. It reminded me of pirates of the Caribbean and why I liked it so much.",Jungle Cruise

258,archangestelle,Watch Pirates of the Caribbean and The Mummy 1999,3,30 July 2021,"Everything looked fake and generic, no wonder it's based on an amusement park ride.The woman, I thought she was talentless, (I only realized she is Emily Blunt from Edge of Tomorrow while watching the end credits.) but now I understand she had a bad role, without charisma or charm.The jokes were lame, the enemies were more ridiculous than scary. This movie is mostly for children and for those who like Disney parks.I know the enemies did wrong, but after 400 years, I think they suffered enough.This movie reminded me of Pirates of the Caribbean and The Mummy 1999, those are more entertaining movies.",Jungle Cruise
259,brainsmasher-66,Not a must see but might be a classic,8,9 August 2021,A little long; but that's my only knock. This movie sticks all of the landings. Dwayne Johnson is taking the baton from Tom Cruise--a guanteed good time at the movies.,Jungle Cruise

261,moviematthewh-60783,"Great cast, action & comedic bits, but a stale plot",7,30 July 2021,"Perfect duo Dwayne and Emily, they were perfect for these roles and bought many comedic moments to the film. The action was great, well worth experiencing this on the big screen as I did. Only issue was the plot is very repetitive as in they need to find something that will help everyone etc, we've seen it in heaps of other films, so nothing special plot wise. I did see many resemblances to films such as raiders of the lost ark and the first pirates of the Caribbean film, which were great films to base ideas off of for this film around many aspects such as the adventure side of the film and the comedy. Overall it was an exciting and funny big screen adventure.",Jungle Cruise
262,TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,Incredibly Forgettable,3,31 July 2021,"I knew, or thought I knew, this movie would not be amazing, it would just be a fun, mindless action movie, with a few good pieces of fantastical eye candy here and there, something like Pirates Of The Caribbean. However this movie goes a step further and fails my expectations of any fun or action whatsoever. The first 10 minutes fly by so abrupt you have to try to focus, in an ACTION MOVIE, on what is happening story-wise. The cast of the movie have very wooden acting, even Emily Blunt, who was a great actor in other movies this year such as A Quiet Place Part II. The movie's plot is incredibly basic and after the hyper-fast first few minutes that it's not very hard to follow. I bet you could fall asleep for a while half of the movie and you would miss nothing because of how many plot points there are that contribute nothing at all. The four extra antagonists besides the main one just might not exist at all, as they serve only as jump scares (which by the way, I'm tired of seeing, Hollywood). The movie's visuals could not be any more bland, the movie is just wood and stone, and nothing else, and it hurts my eyes to look at because of how bored the film feels. The movie is unfunny because the majority of the humor is bad jokes, which the studio prays the audience will find ironically funny, which they ended up not finding funny because comedy does not rely on the irony of it being bad humor and therefore funny. There is a plot twist I shall no say, but it does come out of completely nowhere as an excuse for later events to work out, which gave me the impression the film was being made up as it went along. The one good thing about the movie is one action scene involving the main antagonist killing a handful of scientists in ways unexpectedly brutal for a Disney film. This is only, however, a brief moment of violent bliss before sinking back until a movie that is definition of mediocre. The main set pieces of the movie, you would expect, would probably be breathtaking or cool to look at, but all that it is is just unfortunately bored looking locations. The majority of the fight scenes are basic and obviously not hard to replicate, comprising of punching, punching, and I almost forgot to mention, punching. The film is so trope-filler I could predict every step the characters would take next, and watch them unravel unfortunately accurately. This is an awful movie I would never want to see again. It's not the worst, but if you wish to see it, make sure you buy popcorn, so at least you have a bribe to keep watching.",Jungle Cruise

269,ksharath1999,"The wild adventure of Dr. Lily and Frank, the boatman through Amazon in search of the mythical Tree Of Life",6,4 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise is one of the better surprises this year had in hold. It is nothing more than a visual treat with enough moments to cherish. Coming to performance, Emily Blunt's cuteness and beauty stands above all and feels just like a cherry on top of the cake adding to the positives of the movie. Adventure sequences with some standard CGI/VFX sequences succeed in providing the engaging sequences that form the major part of the movie. Surprising additions like the unexpected suspense and the way they dealt it with the rock music was thoroughly entertaining. Creepy elements and some violence makes this one a stand out among Disney movies. Last but not the least the vibe frames and the light heart moments also adds to the delight the film provides.However, the adventure took its own time to become engaging, till then there are some lag and dull moments. The climax is a typical disney one which feels to be pushed after a near proper ending serious sequence.In the end, Jungle Cruise can be classified as one of the better watchable adventure of the year.Rating:65%",Jungle Cruise

271,syldt1,Disney's ol' 80's blockbuster + CGI galore,6,3 August 2021,"Have I surrendered to the standards that rule the film industry this days?Or is it maybe that I like Dwayne Johnson and I find Emily Blunt slightly more tolerable than the rest of the new generation of actresses?The truth is that I actually enjoyed this movie (not necessarily the CGI galore: CGI sets, CGI river, CGI jaguar, etc.), it gave me the thrill of a 80's blockbuster and, for me, that alone made it worth to watch.Then, most 80's blockbusters, as loved and iconic as they are, are also very silly, corny and cheesy, and Jungle Cruise shares those traits, and some more specific to the present times (pandering to minorities, studio's agenda, etc.).But again, for me it felt like a vehicule to revive all those ol' good movies of yesteryear, with all their flaws, their corniness and implausible plots included, but filmed with all the technical wizardry of today.I could have done without the convoluted bit about the Spanish Conquistadors, and the respective Spanish actors that played them (whom I mostly like in Spanish productions).That plot is underwhelming and looks quite murky. I get it, Collet-Serra nodding to his homeland is understandable, but it does not add to the film.On the acting side, The Rock and Emily Blunt are correct in their respective roles and share good chemistry and it's that chemistry what mostly drives the film.So, if you are an 80's kid and can let yourself get engulfed in nostalgia, you might enjoy this.If, instead, you're looking for something innovative or groundbreaking, then this is not your movie.Note: Like some other fellow imdber stated before, it irked me so much that nobody seemed to care to learn how to pronounce ""lágrimas""! Seriously folks, is not that difficult.",Jungle Cruise
272,finaldestination-g,Only watch it in cinemas,7,3 August 2021,"This movie is not made for home screens, the effects and the experience on the big screen is way better especially that the story is mediocre and borderline boring and it stretches for more than 2 hours. I liked that Disney almost had a 100% gay character on it. Progress I suppose.",Jungle Cruise
273,helghast-1337,It's decent. Worth a watch.,6,1 August 2021,Seemed a little long at times but overall it was a fun movie. Not gonna win awards (or at least it shouldn't. Who knows these days ?) but it's still worth a watch.I'm at a crossroads here. And it's not really a spoiler but one of the characters enjoys members of the same persuasion and I don't get where it fits in the story other than trying to be progressive (they do explain but other than a 20 second story it has nothing else to do with anything). I really don't mind and I'm a proponent of anyone being themselves but when it feels forced for the sake of posterity I don't particularly like it. I'm sure it will get more harsh criticism from certain types out there.,Jungle Cruise

But all the CGI and fantasy elements sadly broke my suspension of disbelief halfway through where it went from 'Jungle Cruise' to 'The Jungle Book'. I can forgive the CGI pet, but snakes that can communicate with people, people who have been dead for 400 years coming alive as CGI monsters, etc? Not for me.",Jungle Cruise
277,Gorillaboi,An average run-of-the mill jungle adventure flick,5,2 August 2021,"If this movie came out in the early 2000s, it would have been considered half-decent. It's got the same vibe as The Mummy and Pirates of the Caribbean.But in 2021 where it's not been long after two Jumanji films set in the jungle (which also star Dwayne Johnson), was there even any need to make this film?Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson give respectable performances. But not enough to save the movie from a boring plot, boring villains and a somewhat forced, cringe love story.All-in-all, a very forgetful movie which was lucky to snap up an Emily Blunt to even be involved in it.",Jungle Cruise
278,bianca-423-52002,Disney Fun,8,30 July 2021,"Firstly, can people please stop complaining about CGI - honestly, what do you want them to do? Use hand puppets? The film is reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean, it's fun, silly and will be loved by children and adult Disney fans - if you're looking for a CGI free adult adventure movie - it's not for you.",Jungle Cruise
279,afrocut,Take the ride,6,3 August 2021,"Disney has a bunch of rides at their park that fans have been demanding, no thats not the word, requesting? No. Asking? OK, asking 'why doesn't this ride have a movie?' After all ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" was successful and popular at some point and even know ""the Haunted Mansion"" was a complete bust we could see something better in the future, so why not ""Jungle Cruise""? It couldn't be hard to come up with a movie about an adventure on a jungle cruise could it? To no shock from any one ,the answer is no it's not. The biggest shock I experienced with the movie was just how fun the cheese can be. This stars Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt as the films main heroes, this should have already been a sign of how unshocked I should have been. They are such likable people and have an incredible ability to turn the worst idea into a fun passable time. They also share some fantastic chemistry that makes their characters really click. It also stars Paul Giamatti and Jesse Plemons as the villains and that right there is enough for me. Both chew their scenery with their branded forms of acting, although Giamatti is not nearly in it enough, Plemons shows up sporadically as an over the top nazi who's more cartoon parody then human and its funny as hell. But its Jack Whitehall who steals the show as the stuffy brother forced along on the adventure. Usually this character can appear as an annoying trope, the Mummy franchise comes to mind, but here he is very endearing and an entertaining character, one who's story can be seen as grating to those who hate ""Woke"" culture being forced into everything, but here it works and it feels natural. These characters are all a blast to watch from one silly and ridiculous set piece to the next. It's unfortunate though that they are forced into some very dark and blurry CGI with another set of villains ripped right from The Pirate franchise. These characters add a twist and some interesting backstory, but come extremely rushed and muddled in night time gloom of the CGI Jungle. These scenes can completely take you out of the quick wit and fast pace plotting that serve the absurdity of it all. Still, it's a good entertaining ride.",Jungle Cruise

Nothing special about this movie, and it's just like every Disney Movies.I know the ending when Frank turn into a stone that frank will not be a stone again, and his cat start make a noise and Emily back there. I was really kinda shock that Disney movie can be like this, that Frank get stabbed by a creepy creature with a sword until the sword through his body.The cinematography was good, and the acting was super good, if you need movie to refreshing I think i recommend you to watch this, if you tired with your life or your job.This movie was super fun, and this movie made for a family movies, and it's not the best or the masterpiece of Disney Movie.",Jungle Cruise

The Rock And Emily Blunt STEAL THE SHOW AND ARE THE HEART AND SOLE OF THIS FILM, Their CHEMISTRY ON SCREEN IS LIKE NEVER BEFORE And ADORED IT, EVEN GIGGLED THROUGH. The Comedy Is SOO WELL DONE And Will Have You Cracking Up In No Tip Top Shape. Plot And Story Is BEAUTIFULLY INTRIGUING. Cast Was Good And Wonderful Performances, Especially From Edgar Ramirez, Raphael Alejandro And Jack Whitehall. INCREDIBLE VIBES THAT I GOT FROM THIS MOVIE: Pirates Of The Caribbean, Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, Even Dora. The Characters And The Endless Adventure Is Soo Much FUN And Some That Will Suprise You Along The Way. Soo Many JUMP SCARES. 2 Hours That Are Perfect. Cinematography IS GORGIOUS And Beautiful Shots. The SOUNDTRACK IS FIRE. Jaume Collet Serra's Directing Work Is PERFECTION AGAIN. Basing It Off The Disney Ride Is Genius And Added To The Fun.I Had Such A BLAST With Disney's Jungle Cruise And One Of The Top Films Of 2021 For Me. Highly Worth The Wait, NEEDS TO BE EXPERIENCED ON THE BIG SCREEN!!",Jungle Cruise

283,Dunkaccino,"Entertaining for sure, but nothing special",6,29 July 2021,"Jungle Cruise is the latest Disney live-action film. The director is Jaume Collet-Serra, who directed many entertaining Liam Neeson action flicks. Glad to say, the direction is gorgeous here.Despite being type-casted, Dwayne Johnson gives a very likable and charming performance. His character and Emily Blunt's scientist character is the best aspect of Jungle Cruise. Their chemistry is very enjoyable.Now there are some dumb Disney jokes, obviously for younger audience to have fun. The jokes are mostly presented by the comic relief character, McGregor.The three main cast work well, but unfortunately not the villains. There are 2 groups of villains, one is the Germans, the other one is some supernatural trope of people. Why can't there just be one?The film asks you to believe a lot of things. There's a certain thing explored about a character in the 2nd act that just didn't work for me. You'll know what I'm talking about when you see it.The movie at times feel like a Disney ride, which is its source material. Jungle Cruise is perfect for people who want a CGI-filled fun ride.",Jungle Cruise

I must have had a big grin on my face for the first 40 minutes.The Rock and Emily Blount were both very funny and had enough chemistry to make their pairing believable. The CGI was impressive and wowed me visually.The story is typical Disney similar to Pirates of the Caribbean. The bad guys are scary but humorous at the same time. The first 2 thirds of the movie was fun but the ending was predictable and a bit tedious. Since I already knew what was going to happen I just wanted it to end. I enjoyed this movie and highly recommend.,Jungle Cruise

He played the role of Emily's brother & he rocked it with his performance. He brought so many comedic moments.2) Great Comedy And ActionThe action & comedy were moving along at about the right pace, never dwelling too long on any of the plot points.3) World-BuildingThe sets, costumes, animals, vibrant colors, darker elements of Amazon, the intro of main characters, every single thing was beautiful enough to maintain the classic atmosphere.",Jungle Cruise

293,antony-69,A rare miss for Johnson and Blunt,4,3 August 2021,"Entertaining in parts. Jack Whitehall is the absolute star of the show. However, the special effects are terrible and, most importantly, so is the plot.It's not that it's a bad story per se. It's that it's wildly derivative of so many other films. In places it even acknowledges the films it rips off by playing the theme tunes of said films during the stolen scenes. Watch out for the obvious nod to Raiders as an example.In this Jumble Cruise, you will find a mix of Moana, POTC, ROTLA, The Mummy, African Queen, Paddington, Dora The Explorer and more.A couple of hours of average entertainment.

Take a dose of early Pirates of the Caribbean, a spoonful of the Jumanji remakes, and a sprinkling of Indiana Jones. That's what this movie was.The casting was on point. I had no idea Paul Giamatti was in this and he was perfect for the role. Emily Blunt was outstanding, and Dwayne Johnson fit his role like a tight fitting glove.Cliches and tropes? Check. Do I care?

I know there's a covid thing going on right now. Just choose unpopular time slots. You won't be disappointed. The production value of this movie is really that good. It's an uplifting movie with great cinematography and well paced editing, so that it's really hard to pick up something bad. However I gave 8 out 10 because the plot wise, it's not really new. You'll feel the combined taste of Indiana Jones and The Pirates of Caribbean. The best thing about this movie for me is that the main PC characters are very well integrated into the story. Each character has just the right amount of the purpose, though we don't get to hear about Lily's life much - another deduction point. Maybe that's left for a sequel?

309,nincubura,Mindless Action Compensates for Lack of Real Creativity,6,2 August 2021,"At least the beginning of Jungle Cruise does well at invoking the themes of the park ride -- which centers on the relationship between the skipper and passengers. That earned two stars. After that, the writers rely upon over-the-top slapstick action, to compensate for a lack of creativity and substance.Unfortunately, I suspect that corporate executives ordered up a mindless hyper-violent video game that should be adapted to film. While the story makes a positive effort at encouraging animal right, that is far outweighed by the objectification, patronizing caricature, and bloodlust, for death of indigenous peoples. Profitable media does not necessarily make good media.This production indicates that the studio has lost its soul in pursuit of profit -- which is the job of every good corporate executive. The real Jungle Cruise ride is not a roller coaster, which this production attempts to be. The ultimate feeling that this digital media barrage of special effects delivers is relief -- when it ends.Yet again, Dwayne Johnson carries the load of showing both compassion and empathy. That alone earned two additional stars. The experience of compassion and empathy is apparently unknown to the writers, who simply take a piecemeal approach of, ""wouldn't that be a cool scene?""",Jungle Cruise
310,mgentalen,"Amazing, Electrifying Ride!",8,2 August 2021,"I went into Jungle Cruise with very low expectations, so low, I was ready to make ""Dwayne is a terrible actor jokes."" As with my piece to "" Cruella"", I was in love with Jungle Cruise.Without giving any plot away, Dwayne pays a captain, ""sailing"" in the Amazon, and plays it off as a "" character"" to tourists. We get the Jungle Cruise that we all know and well, the corny one liners from the Park, the ""scared"" tourists, and yes, going ""behind"" the waterfall.Boat parks at the village, we meet Emily Blunt's character who, after much arm twisting , gets Dwayne to take her and her brother down the Amazon with this ""special"" necklace. Along the way, we meet Indians and a prince with a odd accent who want to derail their plans.There is plenty of adventure and suspense, enough funny one liners to put a smile on your face to think you are back on the attraction. The only reason I did downgrade two stars, thee 2nd act could have been edited down.All in all, this is a see in theatres!",Jungle Cruise
311,Felixhug,2 extra points for just being entertaining,7,1 August 2021,"It's almost impossible to see a solid production anymore coming from America. Everything is either overly dramatic or PC corrected the life out of anything that was remotely a story.This movie is probably only a 5,but I gave it a 7 because it deserves extra applaud for just wanting to entertain. No propaganda, no political nonsense. That was incredibly refreshing. Maybe not all hope it lost.

Well, there are several things that I didn't like about the movie, but then I think it's from Disney, then I can change my perspective a little bit. The storyline is good and the cast is pretty cool, with solid performances from The Rock, Blunt and Edgar Ramirez as well. However, some effects were stupid and some aspects went too far in terms of fantasy. In general, it's a watchable movie, but I don't think I watch it again.",Jungle Cruise

They were really enjoyable to watch and the puns throughout the movie were the best part. They really were even the fact there were so many and I mean there were a lot I still enjoyed it more than the actual film which wasn't bad but it wasn't amazing. Might watch it again in the future when I'm bored or it'll be my new movie to fall asleep to. I saw it in regular version some scenes seemed like it might be cool to watch in 3D but other than that maybe wait for Redbox. Definitely don't spend $30 on Disney+.,Jungle Cruise
315,Yee_Reviews,"Disney's Uncharted, Dora, Mummy, Jumanji, etc..",5,30 July 2021,"Good: The Rock and Emily Blunt really ""Make"" this movie. Without them the movie would not have as much charm and wit. Like the famous Jungle Cruise attraction, there are some good puns/jokes to be had.Bad: The characters are generic, and villains can be too cartoonish at times. The lore is alright and not much of a treasure hunt concerning the puzzles or creativity in the adventure. The CGI of the villains is awful.Overall: Unfortunately, the movie falls into Disney's cash grab of employing high-prolific actors and having high production in a sub-par story capitalizing on its IP's. It is a fine movie because of the Rock and Emily Blunt, but there are much better treasure/adventure movies out there.2.9/5.",Jungle Cruise

I'm a huge fan of both lead actors but this was not the movie that the trailer promised and the trailer was the best bit.

To me the first half of the movie seem to replicate Indiana Jones movies. And then the second afternoon to pirates of the Caribbean. So that's all the creativity Disney has these days to copy other films? The movie was too long for my taste and the CGI was way overused and not that great. The worst part is that the producers trying really hard to create a romantic chemistry between the two main characters but it just did not happen. The kiss near the end was very cringe-worthy. You can tell it was awkward for both actors.,Jungle Cruise
329,clarks58,Movie mixture and just plain fun,8,6 August 2021,"Add The Mummy,Guardians of the Galaxy,Indiana Jones. Avatar with a little Tremors thrown in and you get Jungle Cruise. It starts out fun and continues throughout with a bit of an over reach for a few minutes but still well worth it.Really enjoyed having this type of movie back to just enjoy without any agenda or heavy philological issues.Just plain fun.",Jungle Cruise
330,madden-brad,Fun for kids. Disney plots recycled though,6,2 August 2021,"I like the acting. The swashbuckling. The silliness. I forgive most things for a kids movie. It is getting a bit silly how much recycling Disney is doing. The Rock has to take the heart or arrow head to a place put it in a thing to make a thing happen-is this Moana (which is a better movie) or is this Pirates (which is a better movie). Still, I had fun with my kids, so I don't care too much. :-)",Jungle Cruise

332,chitara-69170,Enjoyable,7,4 August 2021,"This movie is Indiana Jones meets The Mummy, with a little of African Queen thrown in. The story is good, but the scriptwriters IMHO tried to cram a little too much into the first hour so that part does seem rushed. As others have mentioned, there are two sets of villains, one set begin as comic relief then turn really nasty, the other set begin as heartless, yet ultimately become almost tragic. There is also a sub plot in the middle which is not satisfactorily resolved, and the ending, intended as romantic, is slightly macabre.There are some interesting SFX, and plenty of jokes to lighten the mood, without which the story would turn into a Rider Haggard novel without the necessary pathos. And the acting is fine, with good performances all round. Go and see it, and have a good time without taking it too seriously.",Jungle Cruise

334,gillespiesan,"Impossible not to like, difficult to love",7,30 July 2021,"Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt are their usual, hugely enjoyable selves and even Jack Whitehall isn't particularly annoying. The story zips along pleasantly enough, delivering all the necessary action as it does so and, before you know it, two hours have passed agreeably enough. And that's about it, really...You can't help but enjoy everything while it's happening but, once done, there's not an awful lot left on the bones to pick over. Hollywood being what it is, I'm sure a sequel is in the works. There really shouldn't be. They just barely managed to make this initial movie work, trying to repeat that process will, on the evidence of what we have here, be a very risky endeavour. Leave well alone and move on to the next Disneyland attraction would be my advice. Jason Statham in It's A Small World, anyone...?Kudos, by the way, for the excellent use of Metallica's ""Nothing Else Matters""....",Jungle Cruise
335,GeorgeMezori,Above average,5,2 August 2021,"People found some parts funny and enjoyed it. But it was too disney for me. I think the casting was good but the movie was really for kiddy kids.

338,thomasbgleeson,Will easily kill an afternoon,7,31 July 2021,"Borrowing from the Pirates of the Caribbean and The Mummy plots, Jungle Cruise is an inoffensive and easy watch. The film relies heavily on the likeable leads Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt. Like many of Disney's films-based-on-Disney-rides, the plot is thin to say the least but it will entertain the young and bemuse the adults who might be less interested. Even the contrived Jack Whitehall allows the audience a few laughs despite Disney's first ""openly gay"" character still very much in the closet. If you want a family friendly action blockbuster then you could do much worse than this film.",Jungle Cruise
339,BOOKSMART1,Fun During Jungle Cruise,6,13 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise is a fast paced fun movie. Absolute perfection from start to finish, pulls you in and doesn't let you go til it's over. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy and occult seeking Nazis. Dwayne Johnson does a sterling job as Skipper, even if his performance does constantly remind me of Harrison Ford for some reason. This movie is a real treat for the whole family.",Jungle Cruise
340,pn977,Boring despite Emily Blunt's Charm...,5,7 August 2021,"As the movie progressed, I was waiting for a scintillating moment, but there was none of that. Couldn't get a single laugh through the whole movie. Emily Blunt was quite charming, but couldn't overshadow the dull plot. Was expecting it to be something like Jumanji, but failed to be anywhere near it.",Jungle Cruise
341,crazysounds,A fun and beautiful movie,7,2 August 2021,"This movie is fun and entertaining. Younger audiences will most certainly enjoy it. With a bit more editing, the movie could've easily been made into a rated G. Don't expect this movie to be a masterpiece.The movie certainly has many flaws that adults will find unbearable. Including the fact that its is a clone/copy/spin off of Pirates of Caribbean.Given that we live in modern times, Disney has decided to bank on inclusivity (obviously for monetary reasons) and take full advantage of including a LGBTQ character in this movie. The character is portrayed in a very stereotypical manner to provide extra comedic relief. It is more of an insult to the LGBTQ community as opposed to a nod.If you want to watch this movie with your family that includes kids younger than 13, you need to watch it first and/or have the remote handy; so, you can fast forward the undesirable scenes.",Jungle Cruise
342,quiqueperique,Pretty solid Disney adventure movie,8,7 August 2021,"This was a very enjoyable film. The casting is perfect and the chemistry between the characters is what makes this film, mainly Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt which are great together.It remind me of the original Pirates of the Caribbean with a touch of the Brendan Fraiser Mummy and old classic period adventure films. And it totally works!The only questionable thing for me is that the german bad guy feels a little cartoony and flat , but it didn't bother me too much, it is Disney after all so is understandable.Is this gonna be the next big Disney cash-cow adventure franchise? Most probably yes.Is it the next Indiana Jones? Definetely not.Overall this is a really good family fun movie.",Jungle Cruise

The Dad jokes are so bad they are brilliant. Think Peter Pan meet's The Pirates of the Caribbean and you have the story.It's worth watching more than once..... not many of today's movies can say that!",Jungle Cruise
344,StephenIsADumb,"Very Fun Adventure Movie, Slightly Awkward Writing",7,1 August 2021,"This movie is quite reminiscent of The Mummy as some have mentioned. Cheesy, funny, cool SFX, and lots of action. Some characters aren't exactly well-written and humorous moments sometimes fall flat but overall it was very enjoyable. Disney may not always hit the mark but this one definitely deserves some praise. If anything may draw you to go see it it has a unique quality for as much as it borrows from others in the genre.",Jungle Cruise
345,clauzy82,A Fun Family Cruise,6,7 August 2021,"A pretty entertaining film, the action comes fast early on, slows down and becomes predictable but remains fun. The cast Emily Blunt (Lily Houghton) puts in a stellar performance, the clown of the movie Jack Whitehall (MacGregor Houghton) puts in solid show and is fun throughout. Other stand-outs are Paul Giamatti (Nilo) and Jesse Plemons (Prince Joachim). Dwayne Johnson (Frank Wolff) is entertaining and funny, as an actor he knows his limitations and he was a bit hit or miss when it came to emotional acting, making any chemistry between Frank and Lily flat.In brief, Lily is an English explorer is in search for the Tears of the Moon flower, the petals of which can cure anything. Not taken seriously or accepted by her piers because she is a woman as they withhold the arrowhead from her which holds the secret to the sought after petals. She must use her own initiative and take the task into her own hands, followed all the way by her buffoon of a brother, MacGregor. The task includes travelling the formidable Amazon in Brazil to find the location of the flower. Frank, who runs a jungle cruise with his hard bartering and cheap jokes he becomes the only captain who can navigate the impossible task (which turns out to be not really that difficult). The jungle cruise adventure that follows does have its dangers, mainly in the form of Prince Joachim who also searches for he petals to win the war and some long lost Conquistadors are they myth or legend? Who will get to the tree first?Not reading too much into it it's a fun feel good action adventure for all the family, it's no Indiana Jones but rather more on par with Allan Quatermain, if you like a good old fashioned adventure quest or Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson then give it a watch you won't be let down and the kids will love it (Cartoon violence with a few frights but suitable for children).",Jungle Cruise
346,akellashashank,"Watchable "" Cruise ride """,6,30 July 2021,"Cruise is not as effective and entertaining as anticipated but Dwayne Johnson - Emily Blunt are good together and did hold the movie, especially loved Emily and she is the reason for me to sit through, Emily supremacy. Jack Whitehall as Emily's brother is apt and Jesse Plemons is fine. Could've been way better at effects and entertaining part, as it lacks the punch. Bland Disney adventure which failed to get to the peak of other adventure flicks.Even though it has good dose of action/adventure sequences, I felt they're bit underwhelming. Not an outright bad one , watchable. Average !!Emily rocks <3.",Jungle Cruise

359,dslr88,A laughing all the way to the bank jungle cruise,4,4 August 2021,Time for another one of those cynical disney money making schemes based on one of their theme park rides. This indiana jones-pirates wannabe has state of the art effects... That is if we were still living in 2005. Most of the cast is fine but it would have been so much better had a nathan fillion or a ryan gosling being in the lead male role other than dwayne johnson who is just too bland. This is passable but not exactly wonderful entertainment. Theres some action but it all feels so lame and half hearted as if the director decided at the last minute to just let the visual effects guys work it all out.

368,juanquaglia,Atrocious,1,31 July 2021,"As soon as the film started I noticed something was wrong. The pace was very fast and the editing was sloppy. The film doesn't breath, it doesn't stop for even 1 minute to let us get to know the characters and empathise with them, which is a major mistake. But the problems don't stop there. It seems that every single aspect of Jungle Cruise is wrong. The plot is convoluted and full of tired clichés. Many elements have been ""borrowed"" from better films like Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean and Jumanji. The acting is unusually bad for stars like Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson; they seem uninterested for the whole of the film. It was so painful to watch that I couldn't even finish this movie.",Jungle Cruise

Well, that's what this it, just a harmless silly but entertaining adventure movie. It is basically a mix of Indiana Jones and PotC and Jumanji. The main storyline of the first (adventurer seeking a lost mythological land and treasure) and the mythological monsters and humour of the second and the dangerous jungle setting of the third.The movie is well paced but a bit uneven, sometimes a little too fast for my liking with the camera not really showing what's going on, and sometimes slowing down with slow talking parts that take a little too long.If you're looking for some good harmless fun on a saturday night with a box of pop corn, you can't go wrong with this.

376,docpal,Most pathetic adventure once could experience?!,1,31 July 2021,"The starting plot was a bit suspenseful, but within minutes you will realize that the director of the film was struggling to keep up with the suspense. Screenwriters have really tried hard to include some punch lines and stupid comedies, but as of today's film standards those comedies are far outdated and frankly speaking shouldn't be even considered funny by children. It wasn't an adventure movie at all as far the name suggests, moreover just running the scripts to end the film. I suppose Disney have lost the charm. Total waste of 2 hours and the money that was spent for creating this pathetic cruise. Would recommend just to watch it once and never think about it again.",Jungle Cruise

It's a miracle I even have friends ;)Nah, seriously: this movie is worth watching!Edit: was going to give this movie a 9, but Disney openly going for a gay main character? About time! Plus one!

Just, meh.It's a movie you'd put on with your kids and enjoy it because your kids are enjoying it. The writing is very typical with this new era of movies - Corny, layered with one liners designed to make your skin crawl with embarrassment at the attempt of being ""funny"".Yes, the action scenes were also corny.If you've watched any Marvel or DC movie that came out in the last 10 years, you've already heard this script.I just hope the next generation of movies don't continue on with this theme of uninspired, cash grab content.",Jungle Cruise

393,Persiska,fun to watch with some Popcorn,6,4 August 2021,"Mix ""Indiana Jones"" with ""The fountain"" and sprinkle some ""Journey to the Center of the Earth"" on top of it then you have Jungle Cruise.In the End was fun to watch with some Popcorn.",Jungle Cruise
394,chloeurc,Pirates of the Caribbean/Indiana Jones/Anaconda 2,7,17 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise review:Pros:
Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson are actually GREAT together. The chemistry, the vibe and the humor that they display with each other is perfect for this movie. Jungle Cruise itself isn't perfect but it's a total typical Disney fun film. It has a very Pirates of the Caribbean/Indiana Jones (and Anaconda Hunt for the Blood Orchid if you've seen that) vibe to it with cool music moments and even some romance!If you've been on the ride at Disney a bunch of times you will get a lot more of the jokes then if you are not familiar. The ride Jungle Cruise at Disney is KNOWN for its corny dad jokes, if you bring your dad beware of the dumb jokes that will crack him up! Its a movie any Disney family will love, although small kids might get scared or repulsed at some parts.Cons:
Its nothing new. It will remind you of so many movies when you watch it that it could be a little disappointing because it's not anything out of the ordinary for a Disney movie. They didn't get a little creative in the slightest. If you like Dwayne Johnson you will love this movie, if you're wanting to watch him do something different when it comes to his acting, you're out of luck.There are moments where you feel a little bit of a political message with sexual orientation, feminism (in the early 1900s) and animal rights. Although thats not all bad it can be annoying and out of place for a science fiction movie that takes place in the jungle. Also, the beginning of the film has a slow start.All in all though it is still enjoyable! It's cheap fun entertainment (unless you paid 30 bucks on Disney+) Go watch it for yourself and take a run through the jungle! I gave it a 7/10.",Jungle Cruise
395,maverickcowboy,This the best summer fun movie!!,9,31 July 2021,"I was a bit hesitant to see this one but thought I would give it a try. Boy, was I wrong. In my opinion, this movie is absolutely fantastic. The characters are all great, the story line, the action. All top notch. A bit of story flaw but it is quickly overlooked. I can't stop raving about it so go see it. You'll smile. And being just over two hours, it was well worth it. Seemed to go too quickly but well worth the time and money. This would make a great drive-in feature as well.",Jungle Cruise
396,sauerkraut-96467,Quirky but fun,7,4 August 2021,"This movie was not 100% what I was expecting. At first I found it corny and a bit campy. As it moved on, I began to enjoy it. It is somewhat reminiscent of the original Mummy movies. Same types of characters and story line.",Jungle Cruise
397,ItzyNixie,Booga Booga garbage,4,7 August 2021,"It should be entertaining in an early Sunday morning when you are not fully awake, but even in that scenario, the movie is full of awful stereotypes that don't let you enjoy what should be an easy-going movie.If you have young kids, they may like the movie in the same way the would enjoy a rollercoaster. Don't think, just enjoy the ride.The acting is overall mediocre, except for Emily Blunt that gives a decent performance even with this limited Disney character.Dwayne Johnson... sorry, but just shut up, you're not a good actor nor funny.",Jungle Cruise

Great family friendly film and great that it stays true to the spirit of the Jungle Cruise ride. Was worried that they would try too hard and make it more complicated than it needs to be. Silly humor, reasonable plot, likeable actors and off we go on a great adventure!",Jungle Cruise
401,NullUnit,Fun ride...,8,3 August 2021,"This was a decent action movie. Some ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" feel to it without the gory parts. (very Disney adventure overall). Good for the entire family. I don't find Dayne Johnson a spectacular actor, and the storyline gets a tad stretched at one point, but this is still worth catching even if you aren't a DJ fan.The saddest part of the entire film is the first 20 seconds... during the Disney logo.. when I realize my childhood has died because Metallica has a theme song for a Disney movie. Yes Metallica, sure the worst song they've ever written, but still.. it's Disney with Metallica. Oh times have changed.",Jungle Cruise
402,Hoverwolf,Kinda silly actually,3,4 August 2021,"Cute ending, but not much plot substance. Too much action / CGI for my eyeballs for such a meandering storyline.

403,pronuke,A fun movie,7,22 October 2021,Not a big fan of the rock but this was a fun movie. Just don't take it to seriously. It has the over the top to stupid to ever be believable effects but that's ok in this movie as it fits the overall scheme. Just an enjoyable movie.,Jungle Cruise
404,amnatario,Leaves a plastic taste,6,2 August 2021,"Make no mistake, ""Jungle Cruise"" is a competent effort. Solid cast, millions spent in special effects, great set. But it lacks ""meat"", the wow effect to make a real impression.",Jungle Cruise

Emily Blunt and Dwayne Johnson were great though.",Jungle Cruise
406,eandrusk,A Cheap/Corny Blockbuster through and through.,4,6 August 2021,"Basically an old story (Mummy Meets Pirates of the Caribbean) with new Actors/Actresses. I think I really wanted to like this movie? But in the end there were some fatal flaws: (1) Dwayne Johnson's character, while entertaining and believable just had really poor chemistry with Emily Blunt. I kind of felt like I was watching 2 siblings kiss at the end. It was just awkward.... terrific actors, but terrible romance on screen (2) The special effects were cool, and I loved the scenery, but some of the main happenings in the movie had been stolen from other movies almost polar-by-play, for example, in the scene where Emily Blunt steals the arrow-head from the library and falls off the ladder - kind of a big part of the Movie the Mummy -- some of the elements of the movie also felt like a nod back to Pirate of the Caribbean...in the end, elements of the movie just were not unique enough to be considered on their own merit. I've said it lots, but honestly the movie writers are just copying the SAME. DAMN. OLD. MOVIE. Over and over again! Please stop! Get your own ideas Gens Y and Z. In the end, I felt like they could have done a TON of stuff with a theme of Conquistadors, but they just didn't do any research and they didn't use their brains to try to make something more creative. There were some cheap laughs with the tribe knowing Dwayne Johnson, etc. Which were nice fluff, but in the end the plot just wasn't there to make a hearty movie. A Cheap/Corny Blockbuster through and through, but I guess it had a Disney ""feel good ending"" which I liked, so I wouldn't refuse watching it again if forced.",Jungle Cruise
407,docbennettstid,Too Obvious,4,31 July 2021,"Was hoping for more, but all was expected. The action scenes were copies of numerous other Rock movies. Music was directly lifted from past Disney productions.Don't waste your money, you have seen this already.",Jungle Cruise
408,platon_mp,Little something for everyone!,8,4 September 2021,At first i thought i was going to be bored as i dont usually find joy in such movies anymore (im 24). Jungle Cruise proved me wrong. This movie starts just fine but it gets better as it progresses. When you think thats just it theres a surprise that grabs your attention and advances the plot. Also Dwayne can act!In the end i got nothing crazy to complain about as i left with a smile on my face.,Jungle Cruise

410,drwbonfield,Adventure Fantasy that ticks the boxes,7,11 October 2021,"Another decent Disney Adventure Fantasy Movie... Rock = good, Jack Whitehall = Brilliant... and then Emily Blunt... I found her character rather annoying to be honest. Its taken bits from the all others that have gone before it, there's some of the pirate of the Caribbean films in there, some Raiders of the lost ark - it mashed them all together. What you get isn't a classic, but its a decent enough effort. Its cert 12 in the UK but i think younger kids will like it.. its not scary or dark it's Disney !",Jungle Cruise

419,itzakkunwarak,Watch this old fashioned typical Dismey's fantasy ride for Emily Blunt,6,3 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise, is a typical Disney fantasy movie where protagonist as well as antagonist are in a journey to hunt treasure as they believe the stories told by the legends are real. I have seen Dwayne Johnson earlier in JUMANJI and this is nothing new for him. But, Emily Blunt after A QUIET PLACE II she did this with such a delight it was outstanding. Jack Whitehall as McGregor is a comedic relief to watch and Jesse Plemons as Prince Joachim is okay.I didn't enjoyed the story of the movie that really, maybe because I have seen a lot of fantasy with with almost same storyline. There is a twist in this movie on who really is Dwayne Johnson's character Frank but that wasn't really enough atleast for me.As this is a fantasy movie, a lot of VFX is used and it is done in a good way, I really enjoyed the VFX of this movie. The background music of this movie could have been better. The runtime of the movie could have been shortened in editing. Talking about direction, the directorial aspect of the movie is okay. As this is a Disney's product and is targeted to kids and is rated PG-13, don't watch this movie with an expectation of seeing some violent action scenes. There are action scenes where characters get hurt and also die but are choreographed in a comedic way talking kids in mind.So, watch this movie if you have time and you are ready for one more Dwayne Johnson fantasy movie.",Jungle Cruise

It truly is the 'adventure of a lifetime'. The jungle was beautiful and well done, but the best part was the chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Emily blunt (who was amazing). Proxima the jaguar was the cutest though... Some of the monsters CGI was kinda ugly but that doesn't matter when you have a great movie all around. It can't reach the heights of the first Pirates movie but nevertheless better than all 4 sequels and overall amazing movie. Thank you Disney 👍👌",Jungle Cruise

However, the story was really bad to start with, they could have taken it to so many better places, but didn't. Leave your brain, humor and common sense outside the theater, as this movie does not need them.

Good actors have iconic roles that you can't see any other actor being that character and I'm sorry you can replace any actor with the rocks roles especially this one.

All their film releases in recent history have been remakes, reboots, prequels, sequels or spin offs to already existing properties. I shed a tear every time I see what they are doing to the Marvel franchise.Anyway, I was a fan of the jungle cruise ride in my younger years and figured I would give this a go. When it comes to the story you get a pirates of the Caribbean vibe, all the way down to a curse. At times I found the movie forcing some ridiculous interaction or event simply to push the story along. The chemistry between the rock and blunt was good until it turned romantic I guess. The kiss and any events meant to indicate romantic feelings toward each other felt forced and awkward.Overall the movie felt like it was a forced adaptation from a company that continues to milk everything it owns right into the ground. As far as adventure / fantasy movies there are many out there much better than this. I would recommend a skip to this unless you are a die hard disney fan. Even then I think most over the age of 12 would find this movie boring and uninteresting. Some may enjoy it but for this guy, I say save your time.",Jungle Cruise

But since I am not that kind of movie snob I instead review them based on how much fun I had while watching it. Will this be the newer generations The Mummy? Unlikely but you never know. I can see myself revisiting this in a few years time, and I will enjoy the experience just as much as I did the first time.Give it a watch if you like fun, don't watch it if you gave Fight Club a score higher than 8.",Jungle Cruise

463,paulroberts-53775,Great family action film,9,31 July 2021,"Anything that Emily Blunt is in she shines as an actor who has the world at her feet. I went into this film not expecting much, but was I surprised on how much I enjoyed this movie. Disney sure knocked this one out of the park. The rock was on his best form and the chemistry between him and Emily Blunt was undeniable and the banter between the two is what made the movie pop. The CGI was impressive and the animals were believable and just check out the leopard on how well that was done. Jack Whitehall was also excellent as the possibly gay brother and was able to show off his acting chop.The only disappointing thing about the movie was the limited screen time of Paul Giamatti who I feel was grossly underused.All in all a good movie and well done to all involved.",Jungle Cruise
464,Engerek01,Bad CGI and simple boring story.,4,8 November 2021,"First thing first. Emily Blunt is phenomenal. She gives 100% to the scenes and does everything right. You can't help but fall in love with her right from the start.Unfortunately, everything else falls apart. The story is simple, boring and doesn't make sense at some points. You keep expecting something exciting is going to happen but that moment never comes.CGI is all over the place. It doesn't feel natural and feels like overgrown kids make-believe fighting with dolls.Combining story and CGI, the movie can't decide what it wants to do. The movie stats with tones of color and music suited for a lovely children movie but than displays the most disgusting brutal scenes, for no obvious reason. I am asking, why?Actors are generally great, except Dwayne who doesn't like acting very much. Doesn't matter if it is a romantic scene, action moment or something funny, he always has the same exact face. Which gets boring very fast.Despite good acting, characters are 1 dimensional, some doesn't even have dimensions at all. I've seen zombies in movies that had more diversity and character than at least half of the characters in this movie. Which is a shame because I think that's a missed opportunity.The ending is the most typical and simple you can imagine which didn't bring me any joy or sadness or any emotion at all. It ends with an ""exhausting"" joke which did put a smile on my face because it defined the movie perfectly.Suggestion: Next time, invest 10% of the CGI budget to enlarge the writers room and actually bring life to at least some of the characters. With that, the movie could easily become 8 or 9, even 10 with the right polish.",Jungle Cruise
465,mpstratos,Easily Forgettable,5,31 July 2021,"It's one of these movies you forget you ever watch it. The casting is amazing but the characters have no depth, and the script is average at best.

The plot was a bit fanciful and the ending predictable, the bad CGI was distracting and it went a little long (though not by much).

Story line is usual boring one and Dwayne Johnson fails to impress.,Jungle Cruise
470,abeachedwhale,Predictable Stale adaptation of Disney Ride,4,31 July 2021,"Should you see it? Meh, if you've seen pirates of the Caribbean or the African Queen or been on the ride at Disneyland, prepare to be disappointed. They try to make it seem ""fun"" but most of it comes off very forced. Not very original. There's a macguffin, some romance, some carefully placed LGBTQ stuff to make it politically correct. They didn't expound upon that to not alienate anti-LGBTQ people. Which makes it even weaker. Kids might be scared by the Pirates of the Caribbean style animation. A few jump scares too.There's a lot of ""nods"" to things previous. The ride at Disneyland this movie was based on was heavily inspired by the classic movie ""The African Queen"". And the parallels to it are uncannily obvious. But, adding a big name to the male lead draws crowds, even though Johnson looks uncomfortable aim his role.Main Characters: Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is a suspender wearing, flask sipping, river slob just like Humphrey Bogart in the African Queen. However, as Disney does in ALL of their movies now, there's sarcasm up the wazoo. Which is understandable if you've ever been on the ride at Disneyland, the cast members ""guiding "" you along the track and making puns. Some of the puns made are... okay. Most of them are dull and don't hold a candle to some of the routines I've seen at the theme park. As I was watching in the theater what I saw made me think, wow, the writers must have explored every script option at least twice, because the dialogue didn't flow. It was cut up and couldn't get into a rhythm.Emily Blunt: Her character is one dimensional. Typical ""ahead of her time"" feminism trope. I personally really don't like Emily Blunt. She's white, always has a ""know it all"" attitude in all her roles, and doesn't have as much range as her employers or agent might be trying to pass her off as. Her acting technique seems to be ""neutral face"".The villain (Jesse Plemmons) was... ok. It apparently takes place during the early 20th century, around World War 1. I could hear in my head people saying about the villain, ""oh yeah, the Nazi guy? He was creepy. What is it with those Nazis and classical music?"" That made me chuckle because he wasn't a ""Nazi"" but the writers chose a German because ""most people hate Nazis"". Not the actors fault, it's all on the production company. In my humble opinion, that's a very safe artistic choice. This character and his attributes harkens back to Fitzcaraldo with the music playing. At least that's what I saw, insane guy with connection to classical music.The plot was so bad that they had some of the main characters verbal explaining what happens next. Example: ""Look, xxxxx is happening which means that xxxxxxx will happen!"" Very confusing plot when you try to think about motives and the like.Is the choice of name for main conquistador inspired from Aguirre: The Wrath of God? Maybe, I frankly don't care. The Aguirre character and his comrades are undercooked. They're just there for ""cool CG effects"".It wasn't as bad as the Marvel superhero movies though. It is effective at giving the atmosphere of the ride at Disneyland, that's one good thing about it.",Jungle Cruise
471,vishalspeaking,"You know it's good, if it's inspired by a Disneyland ride",6,28 September 2021,"Dwayne and Emily are good in their respective roles.The back story was really really good.The animation was top notch and as a whole was a great watch.I would recommend you to take your loved ones, especially kids who would enjoy it in theatre.A great one time watch.",Jungle Cruise

You can never have a movie anymore without throwing in PC garbage.,Jungle Cruise
481,brionesb,A surprisingly solid family friendly action/adventure!,7,1 August 2021,"I'll be honest, when I heard Disney was making yet another movie based off of their Disneyland rides, I wasn't looking forward to it. Except for Pirates of the Caribbean, every other film based off of a ride they have made felt like it was forced and lacked any charm as well as great storytelling. I'm happy to report that I was wrong this time!The Jungle Cruise opens up with us listening to MacGregor attempting to make a pitch so that they can get access to an arrowhead being held by the Royal Society of explorers. MacGregor has been enlisted by his sister Lily, played by Emily Blunt, so that they can get ahold of this artifact so that they can find a mystical tree with magical healing petals which are supposed to cure all kinds of ailments which she intends to use to do research for cures of all kinds of disease.We eventually discover that Lily does indeed get ahold of the arrowhead & has started off on a journey to South America in search of Nilo, a person that she believes can help her find the mystical tree. It is at this point that we are introduced to jungle cruise tour guide, Frank, played by Dwayne Johnson, who is currently ferrying a group of tourists through the riverside. Lily reluctantly decides to trust Frank who is in serious need of money & off they both go in search of the mystical tree and its magical healing petals!Both Dwayne Johnson & Emily Blunt as the primary leads of the show are both very likable and make for an entertaining show. Dwayne Johnson does a great job as usual and uses his great charisma & charm in playing the somewhat cynical con artist with a heart of gold. I liked that he was able to pull off the Disneyland ride's famous corny dad jokes and silly sense of humor without being cringey, while also playing the big buff action hero with a heart! This movie role plays to his strengths very well. Emily Blunt also does a great job playing the tough as nails, ball busting female role very well and perfectly plays off Dwayne Johnson's goofy character.Jesse Plemons as the German aristocrat, also in pursuit of the same mystical tree with the magical petals is also played very well too. He does a great job playing the villain as both an over the top mustache twirling bad guy, with just enough silliness that the character doesn't come off overly serious given the kind of film this is trying to be. Jack Whitehall as Lily's brother MacGregor also does a great job of being the diva-ish sidekick but also fits in well with the tone of the film.Overall, I thought the story being told in this film was very strong without being overly complicated for a family friendly summer blockbuster. Far too often lately, I've found that a lot of supposedly fun summer blockbuster movies try too hard to be clever with a convoluted story that the audience really doesn't care for. The filmmakers did a great job in delivering a light-hearted and fun adventure that tells just enough story to make us care but without going overboard. Although this movie is rated PG-13, I think most families will be able to enjoy it overall due to the action sequences not being overly intense as would normally be expected nowadays.I highly recommend this film for anyone that wants to go see a fun, silly, action packed adventure with lots of charm. If you are at all familiar with Disneyland ride you will also get a lot of enjoyment out of the callbacks to the corny dad jokes that are told by the ride operators and the overall silly tongue in cheek moments too. Bravo to Disney for going back to the basics and telling a solid story that perfectly matches with the beloved Disneyland ride that everyone knows and loves!",Jungle Cruise
482,kinejin,Kinejin,4,29 September 2021,"Sad to say, this is a really bad film, despite the excellent casting of Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in the leads, and the ever-reliable Jesse Plemons in an interesting turn as a proto-Nazi villain -- straight out of the ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" playbook. I wasn't expecting much from this film, given the source material -- an amusement park ride! -- but thought the sturdy cast could help elevate the material. Even excellent actors such as are on hand here can't help lazy and derivative material. The numerous sexual innuendos are a bit puzzling, especially in a scene between Johnson and Blunt's characters early in the film, apparently to appeal to adults woefully assigned with accompanying their children, but are really out of place and inappropriate. The CGI was expected, and despite such excellent studios as WETA and ILM behind it, was lackluster and unconvincing. Not even worth a view on TV; use the time for anything else.",Jungle Cruise

The movie have some great visual effects but some of them feels a bit outdated.Dwayne Johnson as usual did a charismatic perfomance and Emily Blunt seems to enjoy the role of the heroic and strong Dr Lily who is somewhat a female Indiana Jones, Both the lead shares a great chemistry together(no romantic chemistry, they lack it, a lot) and it's one of the main attraction of this ride.

Surely to say about culprits : they were all evil except the Prince did excellent play. My cudos to director who picturised such thought. There has far words to say about this film.

514,shyamkrishsai,Disney Adventure Ride,8,30 July 2021,"Visually stunning, and entertaining. Disney's adventure magic again. Felt nostalgic as this felt on similar lines as of pirates of the carribean. As both of them are Disney theme park rides. Dwayne proves again to be at his best in adventure roles. Really would have been nice if experienced in a 4DX screen.",Jungle Cruise
515,Lt_Frank_Bullitt,At least it wasn't boring,5,7 August 2021,"The usual The Rock- stuff, meaning solid action and an acceptable storyline. But the special effects and CGI, poor, very poor.",Jungle Cruise
516,bennie026,"The mummy, pirates, national treasure combined",1,24 August 2021,Nothing original about this movie. Makes sense now that the Rock can't get work elsewhere. Disney current ownership is destroying Walts dreams. Hopefully covid sterilized them. The best part was the jungle book Jaguar.,Jungle Cruise

518,tigerscom,Retread script,6,14 August 2021,They basically used a very similar script from pirates of the Caribbean. The guys are cursed cannot die. Where Caribbean had characters that looked similar to fish this one had the characters with jungle attributes. It was a fun movie but the script was very similar. This is what Disney does.,Jungle Cruise
519,mikethet,It's a spectacle but not spectacular.,6,1 August 2021,"It was alright, some parts fun, some parts good. Mostly tedious but pops in enough good small surprises along the way to make it worth watching.Moral of the story though...
Preach wonderous values of sacrifice to save the world from disease then selfishly give it all up to save the one you love... thus dooming millions... but it's ok because luck solves all problems.It's also massively ignorant of history to an insulting level, and no not for why you think, no not for why you think. Regardless, for the nutritional value of visual candy it's worth watching.",Jungle Cruise
520,turboscirocco,Pretty weak for a Disney film with Dwayne Johnson.,5,9 August 2021,I gotta say I felt this movie was pretty weak for a disney film with Dwayne Johnson.It's not a bad movie by any stretch it just could have been a whole lot better. The story line felt hollow to me.,Jungle Cruise
521,goodolludwigvan,Corporate slop,2,3 August 2021,"A cynical cash grab of a movie without a single creative thought of its own. Everything here has been done before and better. Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, etc. This is corporate slop, committee movie making without an ounce of originality, the movie equivalent of a Big Mac. You don't buy it for the taste, you buy it because you know at least you won't get food poisoning. An hour later you forget you had a meal at all. It was just empty calories. That's what this film and virtually everything from Disney studios is these days. Empty calories for your brain.No thank you.",Jungle Cruise
522,jjwolverine,Confused mess of a story,3,25 August 2021,"This move was not at all what I expected. I thought it would be a kid''s movie based on the boat ride at the theme park. It started out well, but soon degenerated into a confused plot that left me wondering what was going on, and what the story was actually about. Then the snakes came out. Lots and lots of snakes. And 400-year old ""dead"" people. After an hour I was thoroughly grossed out by the snakes, vomiting, and gross ""dead"" river men, and so completely confused as to what was going on, that I walked out. You may like this movie, but it was not for me.",Jungle Cruise
523,noeljoshu,Its an acting race,9,1 September 2021,A fantastic movie to watch after a long time especially during the pandemic. The amazing part is that it was like a race for acting by everyone and especially I love the part played by Jesse Plemons who did it amazing to watch. Definitely a must watch movie.,Jungle Cruise
524,Phoneutria-03,A different movie for Disney.,7,6 September 2021,"I found this movie to be more surprising than I had imagined as this wasn't a live action movie the studio usually make because i believe this was based on the 'Jungle Cruise' ride in Disney world. Although for this, the movie was pleasantly surprising. I enjoyed the fact that it was a little like a Pirates of the Caribbean movies, its adventurous and has great actors, what more can I say?",Jungle Cruise
525,TheToday,Fun enough,7,25 August 2021,"""Fun enough"". Jungle Cruise follows the Pirates of the Caribbean ""let's make a fantasy/adventure movie out of a Disneyland attraction"" style and it does it decently, I'll give it that. It's fun, it's entertaining, it's original ish, and nobody can deny the strong chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt.It's not the most original movie in the world. Actually, it's kind of what you'd get if you take The Mummy (1999) and the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie, throw the two in a blender a see what happens. It has resourceful things from both worlds and it's inevitable to think of them but, at the same time, it does it with its own style, and that's what works. So you get exactly what you were looking for: an entertaining enough summer adventure for the family, or that kind of movie you'd watch during a boring and rainy Sunday evening when you don't have any plans and don't wanna think too much, just press ""Play"", laugh and enjoy it.",Jungle Cruise
526,zarcos-01818,Wrong guy,6,4 August 2021,"First of all, an entertaining movie with beautiful visuals. Nothing amazing, nothing boring. But Dwayne. I read a lot of ""great cast"" reviews but Dwayne just doesn't cut it for me in that role. Haven't felt any chemistry between him and Emily Blunt. Relation between them felt dry. She definitely made an effort but Dwayne just isn't enough. Someone like Gerard Butler would have been a much better fit. And a better actor.",Jungle Cruise
527,sdoornik,Great Entertainment for Disney Fans,9,16 October 2021,"Fantastic movie! The ""subtle"" reference to Disney's ride was brilliant. Thoroughly enjoyed every moment of this movie! It has great humour, casting and enough action to hook in the kids and adults alike. This has become a new family favourite.",Jungle Cruise
528,DieselJester-1,A fun adventure/comedy worthy of the likes of Indiana Jones,9,1 August 2021,"If you took The Mummy, Indiana Jones, and Pirates of the Caribbean, this movie would be the result of it. It has the action and the adventure to keep a good pace throughout the movie with jokes and puns spaced in between to keep it lighthearted enough for kids and adults. While Disney has been hit and miss with movies based off of their attractions and rides (Pirates = Good, Haunted Mansion = Bad), Jungle Cruise delivers.Would definitely recommend as this movie is going into my family's normal rotation of movies to watch.",Jungle Cruise
529,stuart_cheek,Easy family viewing,8,30 July 2021,Yes I know this sort thing has been done before but for easy watching with kids this was great. The casting was great and whilst predictable it was a decent enough story line. Overall I thought a fun family film and well worth watching.,Jungle Cruise
530,bigBang8,Very enjoyable,8,2 August 2021,It was just oozing a sense of adventure up until the very end. The very last scene could be cut out and it would be 10/10.CGI was one of the best i've seen and it was always on screen. So it got to the point they can afford to do this for the entire run time without obvious cut backs which is amazing.,Jungle Cruise

532,josh-edmunds,One of the best from Disney,10,31 July 2021,"This movie is a beautiful watch and music to join along with.While people are trying to like it to the first Pirates movie, I believe it was so much better than that!Having Dwayne and Emily as the main cast was a fantastic pick! The addition of Jack Whitehall was a good choice and added a bit of charm instead of being the typical scared sidekick!Artistically it was beautiful to watch and the music throughout was a perfect pick! At one point the addition of a guitar has a Trans Siberian Orchestra feel and the music followed like TSO.Overall I think it's definitely one of Disney's greatest live action movies and I'll definitely see it again!",Jungle Cruise

534,tdestepheno-41630,Good clean fun!,9,3 August 2021,"Good, clean, family movie. Exactly what I needed, and pretty much exactly what I expected. There was even a plot twist I didn't see coming. I wish there were more movies like this. No sex, no swearing, no gore, just thrills. It doesn't need to win any awards, it just needs to entertain. And that it did!",Jungle Cruise
535,biplavpoudel,Fun family movie,7,17 August 2021,This was a good family movie. Don't expect this to much on par with first few movies of Pirates of Caribbean and Mummy. CGI was awful on some part. Some dialogues were terrible. Some dad jokes and gay jokes mixed in between. Acting was- for most part- decent.But this movie is way better than most of the movies released this year. You wouldn't waste your time by watching this movie with your family.,Jungle Cruise
536,darcynader,The best movie-based-on-a-ride that you'll see this year,8,13 August 2021,"Clichéd, derivative, and entirely silly. Loved every minute of it. A great cast, exciting action, fun effects, and a script that's as good as it needs to be. Sometimes movies can just be fun.",Jungle Cruise

Got to say I was pretty impressed. Plenty of good action and, yes to other people's review points there is plenty of Disney wokeness baked in, but they at least found a way to tamp it down to make it tolerable. The banter between The Rock and Emily Blunt is fun to watch and the actors put on a good show. All in all, I would give this movie a high review, definitely worth seeing. We need more entertaining movies like this. People need to remember that Hollywood will always bake politics into movies but I like how they did this with it not being over the top. Bring in good writers and good actors like this and keep the good movie times rolling.",Jungle Cruise

541,ashuj-89103,Disney has lost the plot!,5,7 August 2021,Disney is just becoming more and more insufferable with every movie they make and this Is not different.The so called attempt at comedy was simply not funny and don't even get me started on the choice of actors and the acting itself.Its just plain stupid.,Jungle Cruise
542,nsrnaful,Worth the wait !!!!,8,8 August 2021,"So it's been quite a long time that Disney has been teasing the Jungle Cruise, so yet again, Disney gave us hope to Watch a terrific movie again. Guess what - it came to be an excellent movie, just like how the viewers were amused by the trailers and teasers. Throughout the whole film, the picturization/storyline and the VFX were tremendous but nothing extraordinary to remember repeatedly. It's just a great movie to watch with your family in this pandemic. The movie overall was spotless; however, the character of prince Joachim seemed pretty dull and witty. Overall it's a great adventure/fantasy movie in quite a while!!",Jungle Cruise

544,kayla-21836,Better than expected,8,12 August 2021,"Went to the movie theatre to see this, and I picked this one, not sure if I was gonna like it or find it boring but I didn't really think twice and watched it anyways. The movie slowly started to become more entertaining, and there was also many funny moments I didn't expect, and it was also refreshing see jokes more savage related, that weren't dirty, or naughty due to it being a family movie, and they didn't seem forced.Another thing I was impressed with was all the sight seeing backgrounds, and some of the action... I kept questioning ""How they did that?"" The only thing I found off was all the violence the characters got in that got repetitive, and some scenes were too predictable but again I understand that's why it's called an action movie.Overall I'd recommend, this movie was also over 2 hours long and I didn't even bother checking the time until the credits.",Jungle Cruise
545,aristeidischamilos,A New Franchise with Potential,8,20 August 2021,"When it comes to original content Disney either gets it really right (e.g. Pirates of the Caribbean) or really wrong.So you can imagine I was a bit on the fence before watching this.But the movie pleasantly surprised me! It has stunning sets, costumes, cinematography and production. The story is not bad either with some nice twists.The best thing about this movie is Emily Blunt and the Rock as they have fabulous chemistry and the spark of an amazing film duo!The movie has franchise potential not as much as Pirates of the Caribbean but certainly better than Alice in Wonderland or Maleficent!I think it's worth checking out for a fun time.",Jungle Cruise
546,gkuchmek,only for the simple-minded,2,29 September 2021,"Disney's whole mode of operation now with film is to just throw a lot of money into the CGI dept and hope for the best. Sure, they spent some money on the latest ""actor"" to be en vogue, but -trust me- The Rock and Emily Blunt are 5 trillion miles from Bogart and Hepburn; they can barely keep this thing afloat.After having your eyes pummeled by ""great"" CGI (tell me how ""great"" it is in 5 years!), you get a rehashed ""plot"" leftover from Pirates of the Caribbean and that crappy Mummy remake in the 90s. Plus a lot of Indiana Jones tropes to really drive the point home.Sorry, but Disney is over. Yes, this will make its money back (mostly overseas), and maybe even warrant a sequel; but surely Walt is spinning in his grave!",Jungle Cruise

They took the curse from Pirates from the Pirates of the Caribbean, cursed sailors - I'm sorry conquistador's from the same movie, that hidden thing in the arrow pint is so Lara Croft, there is Mummy elements, Indiana, The Beastmaster...

550,Disneylover34,Disney Pulled It Off.,7,12 August 2021,"Disney's endeavors into the live action realm of recreating already done successful films hasn't gone well, this is obvious. When I heard the idea for this film I excepted very little, especially with the very limited source material. However. This movie was a pleasant surprise. Emily Blunt gives a convincing and exhilarating performance, while Dwayne Johnsons character plays well as the exact opposite of Blunts. The movie stays close to the ride without relying too much on the attraction. The side characters contribute a considerable amount and have many shining moments. Some issues arrive in this film for me with its Italian Caricature. This ""Funny"" character is not believable and very stereotypical, never provided a laugh. Other than this the movie never takes any considerable risks but stays true to the Disney formula and succeeds at it. This is a great adventurous family film that should be seen in theatre for best experience.",Jungle Cruise
551,giedriusles,Summer pick,7,10 August 2021,"Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt engages in a very warm, sensual and fun summer adventure that will remind you - Pirates of the Caribbean .personally, i didn't expect anything special from the movie,but.....the story and dynamics between the actors really worked very well, the film is perfect for the summer season.video quality and effects are high quality, so the film is recommended for both family and friends, but the right company for one viewer - it is best not to hear the story and see it for yourself,",Jungle Cruise

553,alelorier,definitely not pirates of the caribbean,4,24 August 2021,"This is the kind of movie that was supposed to launch a new franchise for Disney but is ultimately failing to do so.Basically the story is almost precisely the same as the first Pirates. The problem is that neither Dwayne Johnson nor Emily Blunt have managed to come up with as strong a performance as Johnny Depp did with Jack Sparrow. And no Geoffrey Rush on top of that.So all in all while its witty and full of well choreographed actions sequences and lavish FX, it just fall short of being exciting even bordering on uninteresting.I'm not sure that the current trend of signing up actors that have a tremendous bodies is really the way to go. Dwayne Johnson is certainly impressive physically but as far as acting is concerned can't say I saw a movie where I found him really good.",Jungle Cruise

555,luhgnut,Meh - Formula Adventure Movie from Disney.,4,12 August 2021,"Disney movies bore me. Why? Because there is no danger. Nobody dies in a Disney movie anymore. Everything is a false ending and this is no different. Whole time I'm watching it, I'm thinking.....""I've been here before."" It's ""Romancing the Stone"" meets ""The African Queen"", with a dash of ""Chitty Chitty Bang Bang"".Without the remote possibility of a primary cast member being killed off in a movie, there is no movie. It's just eye candy. Which this if full of. The ""Cat"" is pretty bad CGI......The writing is pure laziness.Actors don't seem quite sure on how to handle a greenscreen.The matting was bad with obvious splits between action and the mat work.. In 4K it's glaring.Cute movie for the kids I guess. And the easily entertained. Other than that. Pure formula.",Jungle Cruise
556,Mo9z,Okay,6,6 August 2021,"Movie was fun at times, some funny dad jokes, good visuals and solid casting. However, even with the casting I felt like the chemistry wasn't that great between Emily Blunt and The Rock, it felt more like friends rather than romance and some of Dwayne's acting wasn't that great especially near the ending. Also this movie felt like a rip off of both Pirates of the Caribbean and The Mummy, not as good though.",Jungle Cruise

You get the Jungle Cruise.- that's the most I can say with out giving away any twists or spoilers.Emily Blunt, The Rock, and the rest of the casting was very solid. Expect many dead Pan one liners (it is the Jungle Cruise)Many call backs to the ride's one liners, and many Easter eggs from other Disney related movies (and parks)I didn't give this a 10 because I think the music was severely lacking.

She is firstly gorgeous on the screen (again as always), her acting is impeccable and she is so funny, her comic timing is just brilliant!!But unfortunately she just isn't enough to carry the whole film.Dwayne Johnson is kind of mediocre for me, and the role given to Jack Whitehall just got annoying half way through (ok we get it, you're scared of EVERYTHING!!). The main villain too is just not evil enough, he is more camp than bad...I understand it's a Disney film aimed at a younger audience (yes I am 35 lol), but for such a big adventure film story it needed more!!CGI wise - some of it hits beautifully but on the whole the animal effects in particular just look bad! In my opinion for a $200 million budget I think more could have been done.My 3 star rating is based on Emily Blunt alone - mixed with some lovely set pieces!!",Jungle Cruise

573,Cartoonyloonie,A great cast but rehashes a lot of elements from previous films.,6,1 August 2021,"Jungle Cruise is an alright film thanks to the chemistry between Dwayne and Emily that makes it entraining enough to watch for all ages. How ever the narrative is nothing special, and is Disney basically recycling some of their story elements from the past but changing it up a bit to make it some what more interesting. The plot is similar to Tangled with its premise of a specific plant having the ability to provide healing for all kinds of diseases or wounds, except this film is a treasure hunt race between the protagonists and antagonists similar to films like Atlantis: The lost empire.Villains: This film has two sets of villains, one being played by Jesse Plemons, and the other being a group that has a back story with Dwayne character. Jesse character, is one dimensional that has an unclear reason for trying to locate this plant in order to win a war, something that is only mentioned once through out the film and is never really explored further. The other group of villains were pretty great since they had a connection to the character of Dwayne and the Jungle, but didn't have a lot of screen time unfortunately.Supporting characters: The supporting characters to our protagonists is McGregor and a tiger, that although had some funny moments, didn't really have anything to add to the story besides just being there for comedic moments and has a plot device when the story couldn't carry on its own.Stakes: The stakes were pretty high with some close call moments, and knowing how important this plant is to the characters, specifically between Dwayne and the group which is revealed later, really helps create a strong ending.",Jungle Cruise

Kind of a mish-mash of Raiders of the Lost Ark, Mummy, 20000 Leagues Under the Sea, and others. Even the music, which was composed by a first rate composer, was sub-par.

578,jandlhillson,The Mummy meets Pirates on a Goonies adventure ... PFFT!,6,10 August 2021,"My god what a terrible let down after waiting such a long time to see this film due to Covid.Right from the off set the similarities were apparent & all characters akin to the mummy exactly! Take for instance, Lily the feisty ""I am not afraid"" stubborn & intelligent adventurer seeking her ""holy grail"" bringing along her often clumsy & awkward bumbling idiot brother, the weaker of the 2 looking up to his wiser beautiful sister & been her caddy-man with the comical upperclassman element thrown in & afraid of cobwebs let alone the jungle beasties!Our feisty heroine also needs a hero though, somebody strong, brooding & the charismatic charm that she instantly despises & finds him totally aberrant. However comes the journey & the completely predictable telling of the classical bad guys giving chase, seeking the same thing, classic pitfalls and you have yourself ""Evelyn, brother Jonathan & Rick"" from the mummy where rather that the archaeological search in the tombs we're this time going cross jungle and meet with the Goonies treasure ship or is the tree ...hmmm can't remember!Boring as hell.",Jungle Cruise
579,KarenC2020,Action packed - fun filled.,6,3 August 2021,"I enjoyed this film, but I would have enjoyed it a lot more if their were more women in the film, and behind the camera. I think Jesse Plemons is a great actor, but I was unable to tolerate his bad accent, and horrible acting, probably because Prince Joachim's dialogue was idiotic. Had they written the part of the antagonist for a women with a different narrative it would have been a much better movie. I really wanted too see this because I am a huge supporter of Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt films. I thought they had great chemistry. Jack Whitehall was wonderful. I hope to see him in more feature films. This film is a fun ride - I recommend it!",Jungle Cruise
580,kimmy1358-474-779881,FAVORITE MOVIE OF THE YEAR,10,4 August 2021,"""JUNGLE CRUISE"" IS HANDS DOWN, EASILY, TRULY MY FAVORITE MOVIE OF THE YEAR!!!!! I LOVED EVERY SINGLE THING ABOUT IT, BEGINNING TO END!!!!! It reminded me of ALL my favorite things!!! (""Tangled"" especially.) It had comedy, mystery, action, romance... It was truly EVERYTHING!!! Tbh, I might have not seen it if The Rock weren't my mom's favorite actor, but I'm SO GLAD I did! It was SO GOOD that I didn't leave to get candy, even though I tried 3x! I physically could not leave my seat!""Jungle Cruise"" was The Rock at his best! He has never been better & I have never loved him more! I think I've FINALLY reached the age where I'm looking at him in a whole new light. Also, tbh, I've never been the biggest fan of Emily Blunt, but I truly LOVED her here! Between her outfits & her long blonde hair, she looked SO BEAUTIFUL! I fully expect women to dress up as her for Halloween at Disney this year.I want a sequel SO BADLY!!! Idk how it would work, but I would LOVE it!As we were leaving the theater, some boys joked: Will return in ""Jungle Cruise 2: Jungle Cruiser. 2 Jungle 2 Cruise."" I know it's a joke, but I need it!!!(Spoiler: I'm SO GLAD I did not see it in 3D! There were parts that made me JUMP!!! Definitely do not recommend for children.)",Jungle Cruise

582,snuffles-77101,too much unnecessary cgi ruined it for me. kept being pulled out of the film.,4,1 August 2021,"The film itself wasn't all that bad. Just mindless fun which is all it needs to be. Performances are good. However SO much cgi just pulls all sense of wonder, tension and realism out of it. CGI is fine but so much here is gratuitous. In one shot frank throws some coiled rope over a piling and i'm pretty sure the rope is cgi....why!?",Jungle Cruise
583,douteke,Not really there...!!!,4,8 August 2021,"I was so hopeful and expectant, but got quite disappointed!It's nothing like the Indiana Jones movies for sure.The attempt at comedy moments didn't really work. Johnsons accent and shoes did not seem quite of the period. Then the accent of that money lender,that was also atrocious! How whack was that?!The graphics though and the acting went quite well!",Jungle Cruise
584,abdelrahmanmasry,A great movie ... If you're 9,4,5 October 2021,"Dwayne Johnson makes another sweaty appearance in a new safari movie. Expect lots of jumping around and protagonist-like charm that no lady - Emily Blunt in this case - could resist.Nothing but family friendly dialogues and 'intense' fight scenes under mundane orchestral pieces fit for 'exactly this kind of movie'. A must watch if you're babysitting, unless you've already watched Brendan Fraser's The Mummy then you can skip this one.",Jungle Cruise
585,Vivienco,Indiana Jones did it better,5,6 August 2021,Filled in a rainy afternoon but that's it. Was expecting something better. The jokes and puns were flat and a bit grating after the first few. Dig out the old Indiana Jones movies....much better.,Jungle Cruise
586,billcrook,What a Summer blockbuster should be!,9,2 September 2021,"I purchased this movie to watch from home and will watch it multiple times. I've liked Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt in previous movies and from reading the other reviews decided I would probably like this one. I was not disappointed. This movie is filled with action from beginning to end, lots of jokes from Johnson that are so bad they're funny and the chemistry between Johnson & Blunt is really what makes this a delight to watch! Special effects are everything you would expect for a big budget film, plus the soundtrack by James Newton Howard is top notch! So if you loved the Indiana Jones movies you should love this one as well.",Jungle Cruise

590,jbbabycrafts,Meh,4,2 August 2021,"We streamed it on Disney + with our 13 and 15 year old boys. At an hour and a half in we were checking to see how much was left- and shocked to see how much was left. This movie could have benefited from a good haircut trimming it down. We were all really confused about the storyline. The consensus at the end was- that was weird. We've watched Journey to the Mysterious Island, Pirates of the Caribbean, Jumanji I&II all many times. This movie really lacked the magic. Not sure where the hype reviews came from. Did they watch the same movie? Also not sure who this is geared towards. Too long and scary for younger kids. I'd say wait for it to be free in Disney Plus or available at Red Box.",Jungle Cruise
591,reggieltd,Not Disney's finest,5,8 August 2021,"With the cast and the premise this film could have been a family laugh riot but it just misses the mark. The film tries to be National Treasure, Pirattes of the Caribbean and The Mummy rolled into one.......there in lies the films problem it has no identity of its own.Dwayne Johnson is perfectly cast as the skipper and u have to think after the super serious roles of A Quiet Place 1 & 2 Emily Blunt just wanted to do something a lot more light hearted and fun. But she brings some heavy weight credibility to this film and the chemistry between her and The Rock is right there up on the screen.The action sequences are good, the cgi not bad and keeps the film ticking along, but do feel in older films like Pirates and even The Mummy the action sequences are better and more exciting. Overall its a decent, fun, family film that you'll enjoy but probably forget as soon as you've seen it.",Jungle Cruise

Great plot twists and visuals all throughout the movie. The Rock did an Excellent job. He has really evolved in his acting skills. Should definitely be looked at as an evolved actor not just a wrestler now. Good family fun I would recommend to anyone.,Jungle Cruise

596,Mobius_loop,Pleasantly surprised at revisiting my 11 year old sense of wonder,9,24 August 2021,"Yes, this is indeed the ride at the Anaheim Disneyland with a fairly elaborate wrapper. My first encounter was as a wide-eyed 11 year old who realized even then this was terrible cornball kitch, but I found it an enjoyable ride as part of the whole Disney suspension of disbelief experience. Scroll forward a whole lotta years and a bemused middle aged me seeing virtually the same ride. Mildly amusing (but truthfully the other lines were too long). This set my expectations pretty low, but I'm pre-disposed to like any movie with Dwayne Johnson. Going into it, it started to look like a somewhat amusing spin on Tomb Raiders with a ready made McGuffin with a real monacle wearing Tuetonic villan to boot. Jumping forward a bit. The Rock is really quite good with deadpan humor. Feed him some really old jokes and he carries them off well. Airplane it's not, but it sets the tone at just the right level, and never takes itself too seriously. The acting on all parts was superb. Each character including the villians came off true to form and I didn't sense a missed note. Half way in I was feeling 11 years old again waiting for the next surprise. This is a good place to be.",Jungle Cruise

601,tommomarshall,"It's a 'wait for it to be free, Sunday afternoon' kind of movie!",6,30 August 2021,"This film is entertaining enough. Lots of action, very good CGI, and an okay plot. Mildly amusing at times, and an easy watch. It's certainly not, 'edge of your seat' entertainment, or 'laugh out loud' comedy, but it's not bad.The film is just that bit too long (could have done with being 20-30 minutes shorter), and somewhat lacks that connection between the main actors (although it is well acted). A few forced jokes thrown in for the children, but they almost have a negative impact for adults. Again, it's all, okay. Nothing special.Definitely not one to spend too much money on. Wait 6 months or so for this to be on Sky Cinema, or rentable for a few bucks. And then if you're looking for an easy watching, Sunday afternoon kind of film, then yeah, this will do nicely. Or just watch Jumanji again.",Jungle Cruise

Great acting, storyline is sort of from African Queen, bit of The Mummy series, bit of Indiana Jones, bit of Monty Python too. The thing I didnt like and really hurt the film was too many scenes with overwhelming darkness. Couldn't see what was going on.",Jungle Cruise
603,peterbodey,Solid Adventure Family Film,7,15 August 2021,"Although a bit clique at times, Jungle Cruise is an entertaining adventure film that offers some action and CGI. For me, Jungle Cruise was a decent movie. That's about it.

In it, our brave heroes would sail the Amazon while fighting anaconda's, puma's and man-eating natives.This movie is pretty much that in a movie! It even has the snakes, big cats and natives. So of course I enjoyed it. Dwayne and Emily are also enjoying themselves and it's a blast to see them playing as the skipper with the dad jokes and the strong willed heroine.",Jungle Cruise
607,Tikinaut,Less is More,3,21 August 2021,"As my title says, Less is More. Instead of a story driven film the producers decided to go with a huge, over the top, CGI heavy movie. It's essentially The Mummy meets Indiana Jones meets Pirates of the Caribbean. The end result is a confusing and meandering repeat of plots, situations and characters we've already seen in past films.Is this a movie I would watch again? No. And while I like both of the lead actors, they were the only good thing in this movie.Definitely a missed opportunity for a cool franchise. This could have been much better. Too bad.",Jungle Cruise

Indiana Jones, The Mummy, Pirates of the Caribbean, were slightly decent, had enjoyable characters and funny scenes.On the other hand, this one is predictable, tenuous and has non imaginative action.It bags non creative tropes from different good or tasteless so-called adventure films, stale lines and gags, stereotyped characters, doubtful visual effects and image.It is a tiresome and unsavoury waste of time.Disney, you dud(sic!) it again!",Jungle Cruise

617,rodriguezarturo1,Disneyland fans will love it.,6,7 August 2021,If you're a huge fan of The Jungle Cruise ride then you will enjoy this film. It feels like this movie gets a little confused about what it wants to be in about the third act. Dwayne Johnson is entertaining and Emily Blunt does a great job as well but I think most people will forget this movie exists in a few years. I say it's still worth a watch 6.2 out of 10.,Jungle Cruise
618,nickimcneill,So much fun!,9,3 August 2021,"I really enjoyed this movie a lot. Yes it was ridiculous sometimes and campy but I smiled and laughter most of the time.

So if you like those movies, then you will probably like it.",Jungle Cruise
619,onekingprods-54469,Walt Disney Meets 2021 Disney with Mostly Good Results,6,4 August 2021,"As Disney Studios themselves have articulated, in order for them to do their part to spread the message of equity and justice in this world, they need to make money and stay relevant on the world stage. They know that, in order to do that, they have to make movies like Jungle Cruise, so they do. But they're very careful not to enforce any traditional ideas of gender or morality, but rather to gently tip the scales in the direction of progressivism. As long as their movies accomplish that, they're glad to continue to entertain, and this movie is definitely entertaining.That said, Emily Blunt shines in this film, as she so often does. Johnson is charismatic, as well. Credit where credit is due, both of these actors have staying power for a reason, and they're wonderful together. Also, the music and cinematography definitely whisk you away to the magical world of Disney and you're glad to go for the ride.Like lots of modern films, the simple story starts to get bogged down by too many moving parts plot-wise, and the CGI distracts, from time to time. For adults, it will annoy occasionally, but for kids, they'll eat it up.Speaking of the kids, I encourage parents to not put their parenting on hold, just because you're watching a ""Disney"" film. On the contrary, watching a Disney film circa 2021 means you BETTER be involved as a parent, as you watch with your kids, and Jungle Cruise definitely makes that clear. It's a different world now, and we can't pretend otherwise, But for the most part, Jungle Cruise helps us forget that for a while, and does so with aplomb.",Jungle Cruise

626,goelp-32768,A decent Disney movie.,8,3 August 2021,"Well, well. So being clear I'm not a kid but these Disney movies are just amazing, and there isn't any rule that states that only children can only watch these movies, on the contrary these movies should be watched by everyone as it holds those basic human values that we, the new generation regularly ignores. .So, the story is basic, a regular hero and heroine, a jungle filled with magic, and some bad and cursed guys trying their best to stop these main leads to get an ancient magic that can cure any illness in the world and break their curse so that they can also live a good life.So, apart from the story, the movie is amazing. The thing that I liked about the movie was the character's acting. One of the best things about this movie was its cast. No one would have imagined The Rock in a Disney movie, but here we are, and I'm not disappointed. He did pretty good and Emily Blunt was amazing, as always. There's nothing I didn't like about this movie apart from the story.Acting was incredible, VFX were mind-blowing, and the direction was amazing. So, if someone would ask me if they should watch this movie or not, I'll say ""Yes, it's a good movie, wasn't expecting this amazing movie from Disney but it's a type of movie which isn't only for children. So, yeah, go watch it.""",Jungle Cruise

628,eidolongrey,CG-obvIous!,6,31 July 2021,"Was it a decade, or more, ago that Indiana Jones & the my god it was bad was released? One of the key elements of that film that quickly wore thin was the obvious & over abundance of of CGI effects. This film suffers the same burden.There are few movies, especially heavily budgeted ones that don't make use if some special effects, but the problem is over use. Foreground animals & characters become very obvious especially when sitting on top of, at times, an almost entirely rendered background.The film is intended for a younger audience, but I'm unsure even with their excitable minds whether they will be able to ignore some of the more obvious faults.All the actors are good; of course they're hamming it up, it's Disney. Standing out as always is Jesse Plemons, revelling in his bad guy uniform. Emily Blunt excellent as always; Dwayne Johnson solid in his 'cheesy' role. Jack Whitehall played well; cooler than expected which I preferred ... some of the 'joke' lines regarding his sexuality were more than outdated, not quite 'Carry on...' but not 2020s.Overall, reasonably enjoyable, but still can't score it particularly high. It's a heavy re-serving of 'Pirates of the Caribbean.' There are moments; pretty sure the designer nodded to Herzog even if the director / Disney could not be so bold...The kids will enjoy, but it won't light up their Summer.",Jungle Cruise

Not even the great CGI could save this mess.Where have all the good storytellers gone ? Disney should better give it next time to John Favreau, look what he made with the Star Wars Universe !I guess kids will like this, but before you spend extra money on this, better wait when its running in the regular disney plus program to dissapoint you too.DISNEY GIVE ME MY MONEY AND MY TIME BACK !!!",Jungle Cruise

The balance between with the comedy, drama and adventure parts is good. Nothing feels over the top or forced.The unraveling of the plot where done such a enjoyable and clever way that it had my attention throughout the whole movie.This is quite the achievement since I easily get distracted and have the attention-span like a five year old.The chemistry and dynamic feel between Dwayne and Emily is great!The way that they make fun of and constantly irritates one another is cute and made me smile a lot because I can really relate to Dwayne's characters ""ironic the glimpse in the eye humor"" so much!If you want to experience an adventure and have a really good time with a couple of laughs I couldn't recommend this movie enough !",Jungle Cruise

I really admire DWAYN JOHNSON, be he is no Jack Sparrow. The ""special effects"" were Disney-like fantastic... but WAY TOO MUCH for one movie. I was exhausted after watching it, and now - several days later - am having a hard time remembering what the plot was all about. In summation, it was a bad rip-off of RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, complete with Germans trying to get to the ""treasure"" ahead of the British expedition.IF... you want to see a really GOOD ""Jungle Cruise"" movie, then pull up the 1951 Humphrey Bogart and Katherine Hepburn in THE AFRICAN QUEEN. Both were nominated for Best Actor, as well as John Huston for Best Director. Bogart won the Academy Award. That's where the Jungle Cruise attraction idea came from in the first place. You can sit back and enjoy this movie - you won't have to sit on the edge of your seat for 2 hours.",Jungle Cruise
645,yasoo-04,It had its moments...that's all,5,4 August 2021,"The movie started really well, entertaining with interesting characters, anticipated adventure and good jokes.Upon the middle, it is like the genre changed and many plot twists and reveals happened so fast.At the same time towards the end, the movie felt so long and lacking originality in terms of plot and ending.",Jungle Cruise
646,kevlawayne,Great exciting family friendly movie,10,31 July 2021,"Great acting, Great casting, exciting story and a lot of fun. The chemistry was so good obviously Dwayne and Emily were amazing but Jack Whitehall was perfect we need to see him in more movies. Really hope there's a sequel.",Jungle Cruise
647,abiramone,"We've seen it before, but boy, does the formula works.",8,18 August 2021,"I didn't have an expectation towards the movie, not because I wasn't interested or aware of having Dwayne Johnson as the lead, due to him always having bald head and look almost like the same person in every films, simply because I want to enjoy it more, like the old times being a kid watching Disney movies.You may felt you've spent 2 hours on a formulaic Disney movie that you've seen it before. But I didn't complain about the aftertaste.The film is fast paced, funny, with a balanced chemistry between the casts and has an entertaining plot. Like I said, it's seems like we've seen it before, because the they are using similar formula with Pirates of the Carribean, with a little 1999 The Mummy, but in a good and successful way, the way they wished to do in Pirates movies after the third one, but failed miserably.I don't understand the bad reviews. The only thing that I noticed something off was the CGI, it seems like a lot of stuff needed to be, and should have, been retouched. The score and soundtrack also didn't leave a mark, it shoud have a memorable riff of music in intense scenes and the third act, like it did for Pirates movies. But this one was bland, to say the least.The rest was an enjoyable cruise.",Jungle Cruise

651,usfder-70853,Nice and entertaining movie,8,2 August 2021,"I went into the movie not expecting much, especially after seeing that it is a current day female lead Disney movie. Aka i was expecting a Mary Sue.But while Emily Blunts Character is capable she is not a Mary Sue.Now for the Movie, while the plot is somewhat generic: ""Go to the Amazon, find mysthic flower that can do X"" it is very nicely setup.And setups are a common theme here: Something is set up early in the movie and actually leads to a payoff later in the movie.The Character actually have depth to them and some development and aren't just tropes or one off characters.They all do their job pretty good and the bad guys actually speak the language they are supposed to speak 95% of the time.One major flaw for me is the CGI.It just looks cheap.Like 2010 B Movie cheap.But overall i have to say i enjoyed watching the movie.",Jungle Cruise

656,shampyon,Made for theaters; not a lot for the grown-ups,5,31 July 2021,"Of course a film based on a theme park ride is going to be largely spectacle. No-one should go into this expecting Shakespeare. But while this will probably be a lot of fun for the kids, it's not quite as engaging for the adults in the audience. Characters are fairly thin, the CGI use is heavy and takes a lot of the weight out of the action. There are a lot of moments that would probably look amazing in IMAX or 3D but fall flat on a regular TV.Disney hit gold with the balance of spectacle and engaging characters in the Pirates series (especially the first), but in the years since they've had limited success repeating the feat with their other ride-based films. This movie doesn't change their streak, but if you have kids it's not a horrible way to keep them occupied for a few hours.",Jungle Cruise

660,nabischexnayder,A mummy movie wanna be,4,21 August 2021,"This movie is watchable bugs it's not a movie I would want to watch again and I have a few points as to why.1. The ""romance"" was so forced and unnatural that when they were flirting I was confused. I was literally caught off guard when she said she wanted him to stay. They had no chemistry and she was flipping her emotions towards him like crazy.2. The main villain felt completely useless, I honestly believe it would have been a more entertaining movie if the main villain was the conquistadors. They had all the right elements to be a villain with a redemption ark. The prince felt whiny and forgettable.3. The actors felt like they were in the wrong movie. While the brother could be enjoyable at times, his sister (Emily blunt) and frank (the rock) looked to out of place. It felt as if they only wanted big names to be the main characters.4. The jokes were pretty bad...so bad that some were funny but not all of them. The pants joke was so over used and not funny that I couldn't take it seriously. I understand that the time the movie is placed in warrants weird looks for a girl wearing pants but it felt over used.5. The plot really dragged on but I did like the frank twist towards the end. But I couldn't stand the tear and the arrowhead just all of it felt weirdly confusing. For a moment I thought they were all looking for separate things. Also for someone so knowledgeable on the tears of the moon it felt as if lily (Emily blunt) didn't really know anything.I could go on but I'm exhausting myself, I would recommend watching the movie once and getting your own opinion on it but I would never watch it again.",Jungle Cruise
661,mridulish,Solid casting,8,30 July 2021,Acting was very good. Story: a bit cliche. Not boring. It's very good for family and kids. If you want to spend good time then this is a good one.

Kind of like Pirates of the Carribean/the Mummy (1999) vibe.Dwayne Johnson has a nice roll with a dry sense of humour that kind of cracked me up some of the time. It has some good special effects and some twists that made the whole experience entertaining.,Jungle Cruise

666,jonathanschoenlein,Not to Par with Disney Quality,5,17 August 2021,"This movie clearly had an identity crisis and tried to put all of its influences under one roof to create a film concept that ended up being a jumbled mess. You clearly can see the influences from films as The Mummy (1999), Indiana Jones and The Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) and The Pirates of the Carribean: Dead man's chest (2006).The script that was used for the final project takes the blame for most of the shortfalls of the film and its cohesion. In addition we have poor character development which didn't give the audience any incentive for emotional investment in the characters.The villain of the movie was not really that interesting or unique enough to create a memorable character. This has been a staple of Disney Films of creating memorable stand out Villains.The film has slow scenes that makes me feel they just added scenes just simply extend the screen time to just over 2 hours. I rather pay for a good quality 1.5 hour film than waste my time and watch a mediocre 2 hour film.Disney has a history of putting out quality product, but this film I feel was far from hitting that mark.",Jungle Cruise
667,thepatrioticpencil,Swing and a miss!,2,30 July 2021,"Jungle Cruise is clearly another attempt at Disney to capitalize in another one of their beloved rides. Jungle Cruise might be an attraction at Disney Parks but as a movie in runs dry. The movie obviously borrows its concept from its brother ride Pirates of the Caribbean but sadly it does not measure up with obvious story line, sequence and plot points. The bad guy is as generic as the devices used in the movie which have been seen in other pictures in the past. Emily Blunts and Dwayne Johnsons chemistry as banters go is superb but as a love interest is as believable as this movie is sure to NOT get a sequel. Sadly the people behind this movie do not waste the opportunity to inject the audience plainly rejected act of social commentary, if they had invested the same energy into giving the movie an original formula instead of a rehash of past properties it might had a chance to hold its own. As a bored Saturday time killer it works, maybe to waste time at the mall, and or for the kiddies they MIGHT enjoy it. I suggest you leave to watch when it is available without pay.",Jungle Cruise

I went with zero expectations and I had fun with it. But that's about it.It tries to to clone the formula and success of Pirates of the Caribbean and The Mummy, but it doesn't succeed. Maybe because it was conceived as a clone, and not as something original. Or maybe because The Rock pales in comparison to Johnny Depp and Brendan Fraser.",Jungle Cruise

The positive reviews read like a Disney pool of interns pandering to greatness that just wasn't there. It all seemed been there done that and let's do it again. Highly un-original which was disappointing. Blunt & Johnson were extremely ""smug"" in their performances and Whitehall gave me and other audience members the "" cringes"" often. Why he was cast is a mystery. Paul Giamatti must have just wanted a check. It showed. CGI was good but not great.

685,mihir89,Could have been edited better !,5,4 August 2021,I like action adventure movie even if the story is the same old same old with new characters. The issue I found was the editing. Felt like the whole movie was shot in 2 seconds cuts and all in closeups to the face when the characters talked to each other. Was any part at all shot in a jungle as it looked like they CGI everything.Dwayne Johnson was also not very good in this. Looked little off in terms of energy or style. Can't put a finger on what. Good movie to watch but could have been much better.,Jungle Cruise

I guess the production team believed this would create the same experience for audience as the Dwayne Johnson's Jumanji sequels did. But people are getting used to these kinda flicks and as a result there are chances where people may find this boring. This is still a one time watchable movie, but nothing new. In my point of view, it didn't give a roller coaster experience but still a decent one.",Jungle Cruise

The villains that turn into trees and beehives? The crazy German villian that suddenly goes soft for the last 45 minutes. Weird and not pulled off technically with bad CGI. The second half is a total mess. I would not consider watching this again. The Rock is jeapardizing his career signing up for this recurring type of roll in the jungle. He must have some funding need - maybe his 4th Ferrari or something for the so-called new NFL, but he's going to make himself the Spock of jungle movies. The Rock as President? Not after this movie.

Sounds good.Disney CEO: It's settled. Start finding people who want to make it.Mickey: Well alright and I'll see if The Rock will star in it after making that Jumanji sequel people didn't knew they wanted.Disney CEO: You do that Mickey.Mickey: Oh, Boy I can't wait to tell my creator about this!I know you know this isn't Jumanji 4 but there is one in talks. And I personally call it Jumanji 3.5 souley because The Rock's in it.So the story is nothing new or special just a treasure hunt adventure through the jungle to find tree with healing powers. That element from the trailer sounded similar to the Robert Downey Jr. Dr. Dolittle from last year; but different. Not fruit but peddles.Johnson and Blunt have terrific chemistry. And they're dialogue and direction feels like it's coming out of My Fair Lady and other fast-talking movies. Never thought I'd hear it in a Disney movie. I can't recall a time when they did do something like that.At first I thought The Rock was going to be that liar revealed type of character throughout the entire movie but he doesn't do that he has a twist on what he is while Emily Blunt travels along. He's 400 years old and knows all about the Brazilian jungle.Some of the villains have this Curse of the Black Pearl vibe as the story progressed and it feels forced by the CEO. Almost as if after the writers wrote the story they gave them just one change. Now that's me theorizing.Also I saw this in 3D. So cool in that format been over a year since the last time I saw one in 3D it was Onward. Before the COVID pandemic became a big deal in America. Where I'm from.Yet I had fun. This is a mindless popcorn movie like Pirates and don't expect there to be a sequel (the ending kinda teased one), but if they look into it, while working on a Pirates reboot then I'll see if this doesn't go down the same fate as that franchise.7 stars fun adventure flick.

715,skunker88,"Great casting and twist, but the clichés leave lots to be desired",7,22 September 2021,"The casting for this film is wonderful; Emily Blunt and The Rock are a great combination! Jack Whitehall is a wonderful supporting character, and his interactions with the oddly-cast-yet-oddly-fitting Jesse Plemons make the subplot all the more worthwhile. Paul Giamatti is a hilarious cherry on top to the exposition and ending of this film. The setting of the Amazonian jungle is incredibly well executed and the natural enemies to our adventurers create an awesome contrast between comfort and danger for the pampered crew.The film's story is intriguing and ropes you in from the start; the characters are lovable and, as you would hope for a expedition-centered film, you want the characters to reach the end goal, rather than to happen upon it. The ""subantagonists"" (I'm referring to them as this because the film is more about man vs. Nature) such as the jungle natives and German pursuers make the race for the flower all the more exciting. The twist around 2/3rd in the film actually made my heart race; the overdriven action and freakish demises of a few may make this movie a deal breaker for parents with younger kids, to be totally honest.The cliches in this film (if you've seen it, you know to what I am referring) take away sooo much from my enjoyment. They are honestly the only thing holding me back from giving this movie an 8.If you have younger kids, like 9 or below, it made be wise to hold off on this movie, as there are frequent scenes of high intensity action that could be ""scary"" to little ones. There's even a scene with body horror (or as much as Disney can get away with), and a few jumpscares! All in all, a great film for fans of good actors, but don't go into this movie expecting a Shawshank plot.",Jungle Cruise
716,danydarko-34609,"Jungle Cruise is here, is it the new Franchise Disney is hoping it to be?",7,2 August 2021,"Probably yes. Jungle cruise is much of a crowd pleaser film. There is something for everyone, from Dwayne's funny play on word jokes(I have to admit I laughed at most of them, even the guilty pleasure ones!) to Emily Blunt's heroine mishaps, to Jack Whitehall's dry humour. For the first half an hour if your a real movie buff you will notice the uncanny resemblance to the first Mummy(1999). Very similar characters and Very similar story line. But I won't give anything away and even tho very similar, Jungle Cruise proves it is in fact it's own vehicle. It is a welcome return to the summer blockbuster genre, big, loud and most importantly, fun. I have no doubt there will be a sequel as this first adventure proves to be something worth watching. It does get a bit like Pirates, but again, I won't spoil anything. If you know what you like, and this looks like you're kinda thing then watch it as you probably won't be disappointed. Dwayne and Emily's chemistry again proves they knew what they were doing as it is a lot of fun watching the two play off one another. The film slows down a bit in the middle act but before you have time to complain, it roars back into the adventure and fun for the finale. A good fun time for all the family, unless you're looking to take it all seriously, in which case, as Logan would say.....""you picked the wrong film bub!"" Hope this has been helpful and wish you all the best. Until the next time.....May the force be with you.",Jungle Cruise

725,rangerxus,A decent way to spend a hot afternoon in a cool theater,6,5 August 2021,"Entertaining movie but not great, not original, and not memorable. Definitely a mass produced factory-line Disney movie with the obligatory but average CGI that at times appeared too cold to reach realism.The acting was fine. Though Blunt and Johnson tried hard they were just shy of reaching the onscreen chemistry needed for a believable attraction and live happily ever after ending. Plemons as the antagonist of the movie was more a parody than to be taken seriously as a catalyst for the movie's plot line. I did think Paul Giamatti's performance was one of the best of the movie even though a small role.Understanding this is a Disney movie for family audiences helps set the right level of expectation. It is a decent movie for a family ""outing"" though the Christian conservative right may be offended and question the need for inclusion of one scene in particular. I'm sure it will be cut from the Russian release of the movie.Not a summer blockbuster in scale, but a decent way to spend a hot afternoon with the family.",Jungle Cruise

The movie felt it was a mix of many movies put into one - The Mummy, Indiana Jones, Hook etc. There is a lot of forced humor that just fell flat. The villains are just ok. The movie also felt too lengthy and the only thing keeping me awake was the constant movement of my seats as I watched it on 4DX. Wasn't worth the money. Could've been a lot better.",Jungle Cruise

It's a generally fun movie.The ending keeps it from a 7 for me, but overall the frustration and confusion I personally felt about the plot got answered in the end. Emily is yet again charming in a Disney role. Dwayne is yet again in a jungle movie. The casting was good, so there was a good foundation to build the movie.It gets convoluted sometimes, and the beginning sequence was so fast I got whiplash, but it's a kids movie, so I don't mind speedy exposition and zany physics.6.5/10 for me.(what was with that rock music though?

As always chemistry is on point with whatever actor she teams up with and Johnson is no exception. It is mostly fun but the story is iffy and yes there is memories of Pirates and The Mummy all throughout. The rating here on IMDb is pretty much spot on, audience on RT has inflated it to over 90 which it is not. Just have fun with it.

731,hitman_alex,CGI ruined it for me,5,23 September 2021,"Jungle Cruise mixed The Mummy with Indiana Jones and Tomb Raider and that was ok by me. Casting was also a good choice and the script was pretty good.The pacing was fast forward and the only scope of the soundtrack was to make sure the audience is paying attention to whatever is happening.And the worse part was the CGI, that cheap looking CGI. I could not get absorbed into the adventure due to it. The worst kind of CGI.I'll probably have to rewatch the first 2 Mummy movies and Indiana Jones movies to recover after this.",Jungle Cruise

A good refresh of Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean or the Mummy type of story.That said, nothing here is innovating or really new, except putting two great actors together: the Rock and Emily Blunt. The best of the film are the actors. Perhaps it's enough to renew the adventure genre. Imagine Indiana Jones without Harrison Ford, perhaps an impossible fact.Very amusing at the beginning but starts to lose a little of interest in the middle of the film, luckily the plot improves later. I would have cut the film to 1 hour and 30-40 minutes.",Jungle Cruise
737,kmvandenburg-651-254887,Jumanji for Disney,6,31 July 2021,Dwayne Johnson sticks to what he knows. An adventure movie that is fun and family friendly. The movie seems like it could be in the Jumanji trilogy except the comedy is missing Jack Black and Kevin Hart's flare but you do get a bunch of Dad jokes. Emily Blunt proves her talent again. She can do action and quick wit banter better than anyone. Her chemistry with Dwayne makes the movie flow when the script sometimes hits rough waters.

All over the map as far as plausibility, ability to follow the do anything kind of weird legends etc. But like I've mentioned enjoyable. The Rock can make a meditation movie interesting.

747,koushiklaxmipathi,Killers of the flower moon,4,4 August 2021,"* The film had a rocky start; the first 15 minutes weren't precisely ludicrous but were non-engaging for me as an audience
* The characters look so stupid throughout the film, Like Lily Houghton(Emily Blunt) getting duped by Frank(Rock)
* The gimmicks pulled off by Frank are so lame that any sane person would see through them, but our Lily couldn't(Oi, someone tell her!)
* Though, it was supposed to be an adventure movie. It never gave that adrenaline rush or a thrill that you would generally get from watching such movies, e.g., Jumanji movies
* The lack of sense of thrill could be attributed to its generic and predictable screenplay
* It felt that Characters meet because the script demands them to do so, rather than creating a compelling scenario for them to meet
* It's like "", Yeah, we need a hero, a heroine and a sidekick for the adventure.""
* Generally, adventure movies have a wafer-thin plot. This film is no such exception to that
* To that, add lack of proper execution. I never really felt the motivation of the characters to undertake such a hazardous mission which is a classic case of faulty execution
* Jesse Plemons was a generic bad guy with a terrible and forced accent(dew it!), Jack Whitehall tried his best to make me laugh but all in vain
* The visuals were striking enough, though, not 200 million worth striking enough but striking enough nevertheless
* Emily Blunt is the star of the show, though her character was poorly written. She brought out her earnest self. Well, Rock is just himself in all movies
* There were scattered attempts at horror, but in the face of poor writing and clunky dialogue. It felt like a squandered opportunity
* The twist in the middle was a decent one and intriguing
* The ending was generic and predictable(Cmon, What did you expect?). I thought they would go the unexpected route, but no!* Overall, Jungle Cruise is partly entertaining but let down by poor writing and shoddy execution

more than one antagonist. Use of CGI becomes more and more evident in certain scenes (a la Pirates of the Caribbean) which always seems to slightly diminish the stakes in these adventure stories with their otherwise earthy, antique settings.Overall, a fun movie that tries to represent the spirit of the attraction it's based on fairly well.",Jungle Cruise
786,stepfarrugia,Are you kidding me with these positive reviews?,2,1 August 2021,"Do you know how I know 2021 is so far away from 1999? Simple. The writers of this movie thought we'd all forgotten about ""The Mummy (1999)""Funny thing, the Mummy 3 (which was a flop) ended with a ""sequel joke"" saying they found mummies in mexico. Guess the writers of this film didn't take the joke as it was meant to be.Because apparently everyone forgot the very popular blockbuster this movie is absolutely ripping off. It's literally the same story, instead of rivers of sand, an actual river.Starting off with Blunt, the heroine with an adventurous passion and a very obnoxious brother who is incapable of doing anything except whine who is even dressed exactly like the one they ripped off. Hat and all.Then there's the villian, who is a superpowered person trapped in time, who someone from its caste is trying to revive with magical powers the people of the world don't believe in.Then, the big gun comes along. He has some problems with the unfair local Jefe, and he needs money, and is using the heroine to save him. They need a guide! And they find a good looking funny Hero of the story who becomes the main protagonist.I'm not gonna give out any spoilers, However if you watched the Mummy, just superimpose the faces of the new actors over the old ones. That's pretty much a spoiler though right?So just do yourselves a favour, go in your old DVD rack , or your parents, there is bound to be a copy of The mummy. Put it in a DVD player, and put a couple of plants on the TV.I literally made this account just for this.",Jungle Cruise
787,cvoulgaris-32641,NOW THAT WAS UNEXPECTED!!,9,3 September 2021,"Emily Blunt ladies and Gentlemen...what a performance! Wow!!All the cast played well...i mean really well. But Emily Blunt was playing so natural, like she was borned to play this role! I mean if i had to compare her to someone that would be Harrison Ford on Indiana Jones. And if i had to choose between Harrison Ford and Emilly Blunt i was going to choose Emilly Blunt 7 days per week!! WOW!You have to watch the movie to see what i mean...
Now as for the movie, it was a pleasure to watch. Its like a new Indiana Jones movie on the Indiana Jones production quality we r all used.It has humour, adrenaline, plot, sound design, cinematography, visual effects...everything was perfect.If you have kids you dont wanna miss this movie.If you dont have kids you still dont wanna miss this movie. Its not a night movie, but if you have a couple of hours to spend on an evening go for it.",Jungle Cruise
788,palm_first,Full of actions and adventures,7,7 August 2021,"For me I had a lot of fun watching this film because of the actions. The film does look pretty ambitious so it makes the film so enjoyable, but sometimes it does feels too overstuffed. Now the story in this I'm not a fan of it and the character performance I didn't liked it but sometimes it can be funny. Also the villain they could've give us a better character arc. Now that is just something that I didn't liked in this film.Now if if you love action movies you should watch this movie. It's full of fun actions, comedy, adventures and many great visuals but not all elements works in this film.Verdict: 7.8/10.",Jungle Cruise

793,suzumiyayukiteru,Well... it's a Disney movie...,6,30 September 2021,"I'll keep to just the main points.Pros:-
1. Great Cast/ Acting
2. Great Visuals/Graphics
3. Family Friendly
4. Fine action & comedy
5. An expected plot twistCons:
1. Typical Disney/""And they lived happily ever after""
2. Interesting story but again, typical Disney
3. There could've and should've been a little more action, mostly feels comedy but that's to be expected from Disney
4. The movie overall is fine, but nothing extraordinary. The story, even though interesting, would've been way better if not made by Disney, and slightly feels like a feminist version of The Mummy, so don't expect much, cause expectations may lead to disappointments 99% of the timeEnjoyable for the average viewers looking for some funny adventurous movie with good cast and some action, great for kids/family, great for Disney fans.The cast is great, visuals are great as well, subtle mysterious and explorative vibe of the movie along with subtle puns from The Rock makes it even better, and let's not forget the beauty of Emily Blunt. Overall, a very fun movie and great for a Sunday afternoon with your family or cozy in bed with yourself.",Jungle Cruise

It is a fun movie for families to see, nothing more. I pay respect to Johnson for choosing Emily to work with as I am a huge supporter of hers and just like her former co stars he pays her the respect on screen so she can shine. His frame and muscles normally take over so it was nice to see him try to be in the background and focus on the banter. I love the chemistry they have, the back and forth during some of the interviews promoting this movie went down a path that you wouldn't want for a Disney movie if you know what I mean :) Not the best movie of their careers but one to just have a laugh with. 6.5/10.",Jungle Cruise

Is this supposed to be the new pirates of the Caribbean
If so it only managed to do one thing, it makes u appreciate johnny depp even more
Don't waste your time or money on that movie, just skip and watch pirates of the Caribbean again or the mummy or even indiana jones all these are solid fun to watch movies that doesn't ask u to completely cancel your brain to enjoy it !",Jungle Cruise

803,carmen-diana,Disappointing,6,15 September 2021,"I was really frustrated by this movie: it had lots of potential, great actors ... and ruined by ignorant biases and plain wrong facts.I am surprised that in times when being political correct is so important, Disney out of all studios comes out with such a movie and noone complains:
Disney teaches us that there was a random german prince that of course acts as a nazi (because all germans are, right Disney? :( )there's a submarine in 1916 (really?!!) and on top, this submarine is in amazon - and can reach the waterfront!We have absolutely no info on why this random prince is the only person in the world interested by ...

804,thelooserboy,Fell asleep,3,14 September 2021,"This was a bad ripoff of Indiana Jones. Terrible acting, the script was probably slapped togheter in a week, zero chemistry between Emily and Dwane, the action scenes were too much with no breathing room, you can't even understand what is going on. And of course Disney threw in the usual PC crap into the mix to make it even worse. A nazi villan with uniform and medals and an U-boat...I think we beat that horse enough. Sounds like a 5 year old came up with the plot. The visual effects and the Metallica sound track was the only positive about this movie.",Jungle Cruise

Having low expectations was probably a reason I actually enjoyed it. It was campy, predictable but fun and packed with action.

The problem is the continue feeding of Black Legend against Spain and the Conquistadors. Absolutely inaccurate. England wasn't as developed and clean at the time nor Spain so dark. So tired of Disney and it's continuity of the Black Legend against Spain and our legacy. Here the Briefing are the ""good guys"" as usual...well tell that to the natives of the north or elsewhere under the British or it's pirates. Come on Disney!!! Enough is enough!!!",Jungle Cruise

To the top rated viewer who claimed 10-16 years olds will love this - you were very wrong. I had to force my child to remain seated..7 minutes into the film. I love Dwayne & Emily as actors, but only separately.This film is bad for 'any interested parties' as Emily claims after 15mins. Admittedly we're used to the new Disney plot lines and the solidity of Marvel, but I don't even know how to describe what we've just witnessed. If my 10 y/o can see through a CGI leopard then I'm pretty sure an adult can. In the words of my daughter- 'This is absolutely shocking' lol.",Jungle Cruise

They argued and one decided to storm off and play Roblox.We found it to be very enjoyable. Dwayne Johnson was his usual quirky self, with those usual one liners, not to mention some splendid 'DAD' jokes! The movie's pace is on point, Action on point, CG Effects 'Well done.But I finished the movie with a slight empty feeling.Couldn't put my finger on it for a while. Then it clicked. The soundtrack / Score. To me a great adventure movie should have a memorable soundtrack. When we hear the Jaws theme, We know it, Indiana Jones, Halloween, Jurassic Park. These scores make a movie great. I found the music to be a very generic orchestral score. It's strange, James Newton Howard has scored some great movies in the past, and his soundtracks have been noteworthy. Here not so much. All in all a great movie, slightly let down by a score that just isn't memorable.",Jungle Cruise

Emily Blunt plays one of her most likeable characters to date and we even get a little bit of a side to the Rock that we don't typically see. (Unexpected great chemistry between both actors) There is great character diversity and the imagery is beautiful. There are two sets of villains. The Germans are a bit repetitive to raiders and provide the least amount of entertainment, luckily the conquistadors save that. The action scenes are brilliant and bring similar thrills that made the made the first 3 pirates films and Indiana Jones so fun.

831,smak-72430,A little regurgitation of Pirates of the Caribbean,3,31 July 2021,I honestly expected more. The story line was there but it was recycling plots from other movies. It was entertaining to an extent but I think the movie is only rated high because of its actors. Imagine Dead Mans Chest but jungle style. That's about it. I really expected more and was let down... god I hope they don't try to do a sequel. Don't pay for this movie either. Wait til it comes out for free or stream it somewhere else... the only thing good to say about it is that I don't regret the time lost. But 3 stars because of recycled plot.,Jungle Cruise

833,jester-74409,Great fun. Go See It!!,9,31 July 2021,"Honestly.. Brilliant film!! All the best elements from the very best adventure films, all combined into one. The protagonists of The Rock, Emily Blunt and the show stealing Jack Whitehouse echoed the virtually identical three good guys from the first two Mummy films (Frazer, Weiss and Hannah). Also Supernatural homage to the Pirates of the Caribbean films baddies and they are being pursued by Germans, led by a very likeable character, that pleasantly had ZERO Nazi references. The always efficient Paul Giamatti added as a great supporting addition, to a superb cast. People will dissect and try to find fault, but I really can't identify any. I hope there is a sequel.Disney smashed it. Go see it!!",Jungle Cruise

All I knew was that it was PG-13 and the Rock was in it, so I had no idea exactly what to expect other than it was going to be something to do with the jungle and something to do with a cruise.The plot is a basic adventure story with a few twists thrown in here and there. In some ways it was reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean Curse of the Black Pearl.Because I don't want to give anything away I will just say, the best part of the movie for me was hearing my 12-year-old laugh at the corny dad jokes and some of the other scenes in the movie because if you can make her laugh out loud at some silliness then you've produced a good movie.I give this 4 out of 5 of my own arbitrary popcorn awards🍿🍿🍿🍿",Jungle Cruise

Superstar cast and amazing special effects make this movie what it is. Its packed with comedy, action and reveals you didn't see coming. It looks STUNNING, I watched in 3D and was not disappointed. This was a great film to see with the whole family, however there are some parts that could be scary for children 5 and under (Its based in a Jungle with creepy crawlies, paired with the occasional jump scare and slight murder) The plot, if broken down, could be seen as cliche at times but instead of tearing this movie apart, I simply enjoyed it.

843,PuzYT,average modern Disney film,7,7 August 2021,"As of recent I have not been fond of the live action remakes that Disney has been making for the past few years. Seeing them going back to the classic formula of taking a ride to making it into a movie is a nice change of pace. I honestly was a little bit intrigued about this movie but it was pretty alright. I wouldn't say this movie is excellent, even though Frank's jokes honestly made me laugh a few times, but at least it's not recycling one of their classics that I imagine they pull out of the Disney vault annually.",Jungle Cruise

845,dctullisauthor,"You've seen a fair few parts of it before, but it's still a lot of family-oriented fun.",7,4 August 2021,"Mixing up a handful of famous adventure movies, Jungle Cruise succeeds in creating its own blend of family friendly fun. If you throw The Mummy, Pirates of the Caribbean, African Queen, and Raiders of the Lost Ark into a pot with a current Disney spin - you'll find this film. There's certainly drawbacks to that in the form that it recycles many effective parts and pushes a bit of current politics, yet collectively the charm can not be denied.The film succeeds in reinvigorating the spirit of the classical adventure genre, with some creative twists that I did not expect. It does however falter by certain underdeveloped plot points and the overreliance in established tropes and character archetypes. I certainly wish Disney would be more courageous in backing more creative scripts, however I cannot truly fault this film for being a safe yet great time. That's really what it is. It's fairly derivative of a variety of classics, but the stars are charismatic, it's occasionally quite creative, and there's plenty of fun to be found here.",Jungle Cruise

We all were able to watch the movie without anyone getting scared or having to have the two little ones leave for any reason. It's pure entertainment, is it the best movie in the world? No, but at least it's a fun family movie that my in-laws watched because they can't stand super hero movies. Which we all love in our house, but this was a nice change. I won't give any spoilers. It has that feeling of The pirates and mummy franchise. Feel good movies.",Jungle Cruise
878,iflog,The Summer Blockbuster Returns!,8,1 August 2021,"Great movie; terrific casting, massive CGI, a gotcha storyline and an ending that, well...is completely satisfying. My only gripe would be it's length; about 15 minutes too long. But that is no reason to pass on this one, not even close. Emily Blunt shines, literally, because she is glamorously perfect in every scene - not a hair out of place, ever...as it should be in a Disney movie. And Dwayne Johnson scores not only with a gargantuan presence but with a mountain of one liners delivered with deadpan perfection. We really liked this movie, and really, who wouldn't?",Jungle Cruise

They seem like an odd couple at first, but you can tell they genuinely like each other. The whole movie was exciting and had tons of conflict, keeping me interested the whole time. Overall, the movie was great, it left me feeling good in the end and thinking about it the next day.",Jungle Cruise
881,maziwest,Great Movie- Resembles the ride!,8,1 August 2021,"They did a fantastic job giving the Jungle Cruise attraction a sort of back story / purpose. They used details from the attraction itself in the movie, such as the Skipper giving corny jokes, the pistol, and the Indian attacks. The jokes were fantastic!! I highly recommend. They did some solid casting for this movie. I gave it an 8/10 due to a scene or two just not fitting in, not really sure why they would include these scenes. I don't want to spoil but you'll know it when you see them. With that being said some scenes were drug on just it make it last longer (IMO).Overall it was fantastic and I promise the 2 hours are worth it!",Jungle Cruise
882,wisewellnessyl,Comedy and Action,8,1 August 2021,"This was a great adventure film for the whole family! Excellent jokes throughout and plenty of action to keep you interested. The special effects were fantastic and remind me a lot of Pirates of the Caribbean films. While I thoroughly enjoyed both of the characters, the topic of conversation between MacGregor and Frank as they chopped tree limbs was a detour from the plot and had no real place in the story. It was completely unnecessary to include and didn't add anything to the film. Emily Blunt was wonderful as always! I was glad to see Veronica Falcon in the film. She was a favorite actress of mine from Queen of the South (tv show.)",Jungle Cruise
883,xjtxnfgst,Pirates crossed with Jumanji and press repeat,2,1 August 2021,"Oh my word - how lazy were the writers of this. From the beginning it feels like a cheap version of the Pirates franchise - cursed undead bad guys (used as a plot device to save the good guys), the lead in love with his ship (or boat in this instance), crazy unplanned amazing escapes, and everything being dependent on some last minute moonlight!The Rock dials it in by taking his Jumanji character and removing the likeableness, replacing it with worse jokes than an early 2000s Jack Whitehall performance (where it's either Dad jokes, public school encounters, or homophobic rubbish).At no time is Emily Blunts character believably falling for the Rock. Too little relationship development, which is odd given the first hour feels like overly extended character development with very little plot.Predictable conclusion, lazy repeated story telling, all in all the bad cgi Jaguar was by far and away the best character. Do yourselves a favour, don't waste your money and watch Pirates or Jumanji again for free. Please don't make another one!(On the plus side, and the only reason it gets an extra star, if you have young kids, the extended run time means might actually get through a bottle of wine in peace whilst they watch this rubbish).",Jungle Cruise
884,guybug,Great movie!!,9,1 August 2021,"Personally, I LOVE this movie!!! I love the plot and cast. Might be bias because I love everything with Jack Whitehall but removing my bias I still love this! The character personalities are great, and the jokes are just like the ones you hear on the Disney ride. I love McGregor, he is absolutely someone who shouldn't be in the Jungle and seeing him in that environment is amazing and funny. Also, when McGregor came out to Frank I totally didn't expect it. That is an awesome detail. As someone apart of the LGBTQ+ community, seeing my favorite character be gay made me so happy I was practically jumping from my seat. Moving on, Lily is determined and fun. She goes through the movie wearing pants in a time period where women are shamed for doing it. Frank is awesome and his puns are so bad its good. They all have their own interesting back stories, I love it. A lot of people say the storyline/plot was sort of bland and I can see that but to me the characters and their personalities make up for it. Love it!",Jungle Cruise
885,dannyapostol,Not for me,5,1 August 2021,"For me was boring. Maybe its for kids. I like the acapella version of the song from Metallica , Emily Blunt and certain scenes reminiscent of Pirates of the Caribbean.1. Plot, rather stilted. Personally I didn't like it.2. They talk about the movie taking place in the Amazon and clearly the Amazon is such a magnificent place that it could not be represented in the movie.4. The language, they decide to speak Spanish in several parts and the Spanish in The Rock is really bad, many unintelligible and mispronounced words.5. Animals. Why the Leopard looks like the size of a Bengal Tiger. All the animals looked very unrealistic.",Jungle Cruise

This movie definitely paid homage to the classics and others that came before it on multiple occasions. Multiple scenes feel like small little love letters to films like The Mummy, Indiana Jones, Tomb Raider, Pirates of the Caribbean, all while being respectfully unique. I'd highly recommend this film to anyone who's a fan of the high adventure genre.",Jungle Cruise

890,matirocks,Horrible,1,5 August 2021,"Horrible. The storyline was terrible and most actors sucked. The only reason this movie is even relalvent is because Dwayne Johnnson and Emily Blunt are in the movie. Sorry but this is just a horrible movie but this is only my opinion (and my family's)
I do not recomend this movie. Cg was below average for a 2021 movie.",Jungle Cruise
891,nathanebatten,The Worst Movie I've Ever Seen,1,5 August 2021,"I cannot believe how many positive reviews there are of this film. A classic case of having a concept without any idea how to write a story. The characters were entirely unrelatable, unfunny, and predictable. The story was pathetic. The move was generally awful.The only reason this is even watched is because it's made by Disney and it has a well-known and well-liked cast. Why don't people know how to tell stories anymore? Great characters, an exciting plot, an interesting twist. Instead, we get lumbered with no character, a boring plot, and predictable storylines.People don't seem to want to tell stories anymore - CGI and big budgets mean that studios can get away with lazy storytelling as they don't need to necessarily write a good one to engage the audience. If you want to watch a good film with a good story from Disney, watch a Pixar - they (at least for now) know how to tell a story.In short, this film is very exciting for an idle-minded child or your general moron.",Jungle Cruise

893,cywvvy,Great fun for all the family,9,7 August 2021,"This is a great film for two hours of escapism of good humour fused with CGI with very well paired actors.

897,nheilsberg,Mostly good buuuut not the best,6,8 August 2021,"Obviously Dwayne Johnson is one of my favorites and a crowd pleaser. Emily Blunt is pretty great as well. However some unnecessary lines were added to this film that seemed well out of place. When the brother is hot he comments ""my balls are sweaty"". Just not that funny to be honest. As well when the general at the end says ""oh schister"" not that swearing is needed in a Disney movie but they could have played it up a little more.

We went with a friend who worked on the cruise in Anaheim for years, and I will say - she was less impressed.Perhaps it was the thrill of being out in a public setting like this for the first time in years, but I was giddy as a five year old the entire time.

I was expecting a dieselpunk Pirates of the Caribbean. A little mystery, a little romance, some witty repartee, a hummable soundtrack, and action sequences to boost the run time from 1:20 to 1:45.The soundtrack was meh, the mystery and romance were there in reasonable amounts.As for the script I liked the callouts to the African Queen, The repartee was mostly there but some scenes felt out of order and just cobbled on. A dead squirrel to summon piranha in the water he just told her to swim in.A lot of the action didn't make sense.

937,v_jay3,Good family fun,7,8 August 2021,"Went with wife and kids (9-10). All enjoyed the film and rated it much higher than me. Felt a bit slow in the middle.Good performances by Dwayne, Emily and Jack.",Jungle Cruise
938,carolynanderslyman,"African Queen + Pirates of the Caribbean, with a Disney spin",8,31 July 2021,"Was about 30 min too long though, hence deduction of a couple stars, but otherwise a fun ride. Looking forward to visiting Magic Kingdom now again soon to see how they've improved that attraction to follow this film!",Jungle Cruise
939,jdiam-857-125722,Best movie of the year so far!,9,31 July 2021,It's on par with the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. It didn't appear to have as big of budget but the story and acting were better than the Johnny Dope franchise.,Jungle Cruise
940,marcelo-122-302926,Very weak.,3,1 August 2021,"It is inconceivable that in 2021 Disney doesn't have a language coach to guide somewhat proper pronunciation. The conquistadors spoke the word ""lágrima"" correctly a dozen times in Spanish, but no one could say the exact same word with the exact same pronunciation in Portuguese.Not only that, the timeline and music are totally forgettable after s few days.Very weak movie for Disney.",Jungle Cruise
941,davewillie-139-279371,Typical Dwayne Johnson Movie,6,13 August 2021,Jungle Cruise was a typical Dwayne Johnson movie. Decent family fare. Not very imaginative. Jokes were extremely pedestrian. Tolerated 30 minutes before I had to take two shots of Jack to be able to continue watching.,Jungle Cruise
942,blamb133,Couldn't finish,3,12 August 2021,The movie would have been better if Emily Blunt's character had less lines.,Jungle Cruise
943,kylehendersondj,So fun!,8,1 August 2021,"Loved this movie. The casting was on point and there was plenty of comedy, action, love and just all round fun in it. Would definitely recommend watching. I thought the imdb rating was quite low on this one for what it deserves.",Jungle Cruise
944,darleyplano,Jungle Cruise,4,15 August 2021,I liked the characters but it does not hold up alongside of Johnny Depp and the Pirates movies. I bought mine through Disney+. That was the best part of it.,Jungle Cruise
945,dugchugger-97001,Jungle Cruise Delivers,9,3 August 2021,"Apart from a cheesy adventure story with a mythical-tinged storyline, breathtaking scenery and the obligatory contentious love story resplendent with a quirky side-kick... what else did you expect? It's no Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean, or The Mummy, but it shares a similar nuance with Romancing the Stone, Tomb Raider, King Solomon's Mines (Richard Chamberlain) and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's brand of Jumanji and Journey2.I'd make this a date movie or something fun to watch with mates; but if you're watching this alone and expecting something more cerebral, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment.I love this movie and would like to see more movies like this.",Jungle Cruise
946,ghaza-56283,"So bad, even for children",3,6 August 2021,"The use of VFX is bad, the cinematography is bad too. The story has nothing new or charming about it. Almost funny jokes, Heavily relying on Dwayn and Emily's presence.The only good thing about the movie is Emily Blunt's Acting.Not sure if children would enjoy the movie but overall it is a cheap cinematic experience for adults.",Jungle Cruise
947,navinbhuiyan,Excellent Story with Good Acting.,10,8 August 2021,Recommended to watch in halls. Excellent combination.,Jungle Cruise
948,jhogberg-07571,Simple and enjoyable - not more.,5,31 July 2021,"The movie tries to tick all the boxes for a classic adventure movie with kids as the target audience. It was enjoyable if you take it for what it is, and the acting is great from the main cast - especially from blunt. However, the whole thing is shot on green screen and the CGI leaves a lot to ask for and makes you dream about going back to the real life settings of Indiana Jones. The plot really isn't that great either with unnecessary characters and plot holes. It does make you giggle at times though - for both the right and wring reasons.Worth a watch if you watch it with your kids.",Jungle Cruise
949,norarydding,A pleasant surprise,7,2 August 2021,"What a pleasant surprise! Didn't really expect much after watching the trailer, but I found this to be a fun movie with a very likeable cast, great effects, and also some twists that I didn't see coming. Glad i watched it!!:))",Jungle Cruise
950,sambondster,EXCLUSIVE COMEDY FOR ENTERTAINMENT,9,28 July 2021,Not boring and not for people with high IQ.just watch and keep laughing.....,Jungle Cruise
951,bjnewton-27214,"Great cast, boring plot that has been used.",2,22 August 2021,"The Rock and Emily Blunt carry this, but they can't save it.Save your time.",Jungle Cruise
952,thomas-582,Visually annoying,5,2 October 2021,"The chemistry between the protagonists is what kept me going until the end. As did the humor, including the dad jokes.As for the rest, the movie feels completely artificial. Visually it is just pure CGI, unnatural HDR lighting and colors. While you could argue that this is completely intentional, there's clearly a trend in this direction and unfortunately it's such an annoyance to me that I just can't enjoy the movie at allKudos to the actors though that can pull it off to make a full movie just on the green screen and still transport emotions.",Jungle Cruise
953,briandean-00798,Boring,1,17 August 2021,Took 3 kids to go see this in theaters ages 3-7. Movie could not maintain their attention past the popcorn.,Jungle Cruise
954,richarddavid-74619,Very funny,9,31 July 2021,Jack Whitehall was excellent really fun film. Kids loved it.,Jungle Cruise
955,bigtr,"Solid 8, maybe 8 1/2, very enjoyable",8,2 August 2021,"This movie left me smiling throughout. From the moment the movie opens, I'm smiling, because they used ""Nothing Else Matters"" as the opening music - one of my all-time favorite songs. The Rock's first scene had me cracking up. From his sass, to his Dad Jokes and seriously lame puns, Mr. Johnson definitely delivers. Definitely a wild, funny, enjoyable ride that is worth watching.",Jungle Cruise
956,ehperu,Better than expected,10,30 July 2021,"Huge Disneyland fans, we've been waiting for this movie with some anticipation. I am not one to go out of my way to leave a review but felt compelled to do so. This is an EXCELLENT family film. Borderline PG, but guessing the action/fight scenes and suspense pushed it to pg-13. Had a lot of fun...the corny humor matches what you'd experience in the jungle cruise ride in Disneyland. Really was a fun movie. Anyone who suggests otherwise must be a very boring person.",Jungle Cruise
957,jensmahlernielsen,JungleTubbies,1,17 October 2021,Just like eating fastfood you feel cozy in a river of clichées from any adventure movie from the last 100 years. Only 4 screenwriters are credited - it should have been all or none.The indigenous people and their culture is portraited as phony and easily totally obliterated (twice in the movie).It is OK to have an amazon ride in Disneyland but putting Disneyland rides in the Amazon is so not 2021 - and feels like Preparation for Appropriation. The Amazon indigenous people are few and precious.,Jungle Cruise
958,aliraewriting,Pirates of the Amazon,5,28 August 2021,"Didn't think it was possible but Disney literally ripped off its own series. This movie started out as the actual jungle cruise and very quickly turned to Bootstrap Bill and cursed gold coins and tribal indians turning Jack into a fruit kabob. Change the Caribbean to Brazil and switch the pet from a monkey to a jaguar and you've got yourself a brand new family adventure film. An adequately entertaining movie over all, but lacking the chemistry that Kierra Knightley and Orlando Bloom brought to the whole franchise. Disney's scraping the bottom of the barrel... what's next, rename Lightning McQueen and call it Autopia?",Jungle Cruise
959,ocuntay,Sooo much fun,10,1 August 2021,"We went with children, soo much fun! It was like a roller coaster, a job well done! Although some scenes may be a little too much for younger audiences.",Jungle Cruise
960,asilve,Fun story with lack luster chemistry,7,22 August 2021,The story overall was fun but there were a number of things that really sucked. The chemistry between characters was seriously lacking and the 'romantic' aspect seemed so forced.,Jungle Cruise
961,lsaxinger,Really loved it! Lots of adventure - NEVER BORED!!,10,31 August 2021,"I love this movie! When Frank led the adventure cruise tour in the beginning, I laughed so hard because I thought I was at Disneyland! I'm a Disney geek and can't tell you how many times I've ridden the Jungle Cruise ride. It made that experience as fresh as my first ride!! So many of the same jokes and gags from the ride. I can imagine how freaky it would be to ride this on the actual Amazon!!I had a very stressful week this week, and this totally distracted me made me laugh and left me feeling in a great mood! Great movie!!",Jungle Cruise
962,costy_tica,Two hours of pure cliches.,5,18 August 2021,It's an extraordinary performance to gather all the possible cliches in a single movie.,Jungle Cruise
963,flima-03186,Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.,1,4 August 2021,"I wanted to see a light and adventure movie with my nephew and nice. But don't have enough words to say how this movie is bad. I love both of the main actors but this is so absurd and stupid that I felt sorry for them to be involved in such a poor, nonsense, silly and absurd script and movie. Everything was obvious, the story was not catchy at all. And the spotted jaguar behaving like a dog and the bee answering yes and no was way too much for me to buy. This movie sucks big time.",Jungle Cruise
964,valeksiev-81093,time to loose,4,7 August 2021,Nothing special. No chemistry between the characters.,Jungle Cruise
965,erivera-06060,I liked it better when...,4,6 August 2021,"I liked the better when I watched the first time. This movie reminded me of the mummy and pirates of the caribbean. Same Disney story, looking for treasure, cursed gold, cursed people and a unbelievable love story with a lot of annoying banter.",Jungle Cruise
966,justthisleah,Just plain fun,8,31 July 2021,"I was looking forward to seeing this in hopes it would somewhat be the next ""Night at the Museum"" or ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" and I definitely think it could be (if they continue this as a series). This movie was entertaining, fun, and exciting, just a great popcorn flick. I think it's definitely worth the watch. I'm no critic, what I'm looking for in a movie is for it to be entertaining, and Jungle Cruise did just that.",Jungle Cruise
967,tarekdemachkie,It fun but predictable,5,31 July 2021,It fun but predictable. Fell asleep half way for a few minutes!,Jungle Cruise
968,House789,Copy and Paste,7,1 August 2021,"It was a good movie don't get me wrong, but they basically took the plot of Pirates of the Caribbean(another movie based off of a Disney ride) and just changed a few details to make it ""different"". The acting was solid and I loved Dwayne Johnson in it but overall very repetitive to PotC.",Jungle Cruise
969,scubaboy-72039,My favorite Disney move as of today!,10,30 July 2021,"The Chemistry Between the actors is amazing, highly recommend this movie.",Jungle Cruise
