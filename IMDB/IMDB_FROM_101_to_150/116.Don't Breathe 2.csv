0,SnoopyStyle,like the first half,5,9 September 2021,It's 8 years after the first movie. The original house has been burnt down. The Blind Man (Stephen Lang) is raising young Phoenix (Madelyn Grace) in a different isolated house. He's overly protective. A creepy man takes an interest in Phoenix and follows her back home with his gang of thugs.I don't mind the first half of the movie. It's interesting to see the story from the other side. I don't like the revelations in the second half of the movie. They are either too convenient or too unlikely. Why can't he just be a creepy child trafficker? The other issue is that the story should stay in that house. The Blind Man should have a way to turn off all the lights in his own home. I really like sneaking around although I don't know how long that could last. I'd rather find out than doing what this movie does in the second half.,Don't Breathe 2
1,nogodnomasters,My Name is Phoenix,8,25 August 2021,"Our blind Navy Seal, Norman survives another day living in an isolated house. He is raising a girl (Madelyn Grace) as his own who is not his daughter. She is an orphan from a house fire, which we later discover was cooking meth. Norman looks for redemption Silas Marner style (They should have named her Eppie). From the TV we know there are folks being kidnapped for organ transplants in the Detroit area. When intruders enter his house wanting to kidnap the girl, it is another fight to the death in the dark.This is another enjoyable feature in the genre of oddball home break-in films. I even liked the ending. The main issue I have is this sequel is made five years later and who the heck remembers the first one? There is no quick recap of events.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",Don't Breathe 2
2,kosmasp,Family to the death,7,14 September 2021,"Our main character at one point says ""breathe, breathe"" ... which is kind of ironic considering the title of the movie! That aside, the sequel works if you can suspend your disbelief in more than one way. One of the things you have to be aware of is the role/character Stephen Lang is playing.Now I do assume you have seen the first Don't Breathe movie, even if this also works as a standalone of sorts. It does continue the story from the first one or rather picks up where the other one left off. Before it does leap and jump into the future (few years ahead).So if you can dig a bit of a transformation of Langs character and can forget the evil he has done ... at least push it back and don't hate him that much .. the movie sort of works.There is a lot of violence, most off screen, but we do get to see a lot horrible stuff. Not for the faint of hearted for sure. And an expected bonus scene after the credits (if you know one is coming) rounds things up ... sort of.",Don't Breathe 2
3,jboothmillard,Don't Breathe 2,5,19 August 2021,"The first film was a big hit scary movie, I saw the trailer for the sequel, and I was intrigued how it was going to play out, it got mixed reviews from critics, but I wanted to make my own mind up. Basically, it has been eight years since the previous events, former Navy Seal Norman Nordstrom aka The Blind Man (Avatar's Stephen Lang) lives in relative solitude in an isolated cabin in the suburbs of Detroit with his Rottweiler, Shadow. He has since taken in and raised orphaned eleven-year-old girl Phoenix (Madelyn Grace), telling her that her mother died in a house fire. The Blind Man's only connection with society is supplies dropped off by his friend, former Army Ranger Hernandez (Stephanie Arcila). She convinces the Blind Man to allow Phoenix to join her on a trip to town so that she can have some time out of the house. While running errands together, Hernandez stops at a gas station to refuel. Phoenix uses the bathroom and a man named Raylan (Brendan Sexton III) tries to talk to her before she leaves with Hernandez. Raylan and his men secretly follow Hernandez back to the Blind Man's cabin. They wait for Hernandez to drop the girl off before ambushing them. The men kill Hernandez and Shadow. The Blind Man goes outside looking for the dog, while Raylan's men enter the house to kidnap Phoenix. The Blind Man finds Shadow's dead body before running back to the house to protect Phoenix. A struggle ensues between the Blind Man and the gang members, in which he kills several of the men. It is revealed that eight years ago, Phoenix's house burned down because a meth lab in the basement exploded. Raylan, a notorious drug dealer, was taken into custody after the explosion and sentenced to eight years for various crimes. The Blind Man found Phoenix unconscious outside the burned house with his dog and took her home to fulfil his need to have a daughter again. After being released, Raylan found out his daughter was still alive when he saw her leaving flowers for her mother's memorial at the burned house. Phoenix tries to run away but is knocked unconscious by Raylan's cohort Raul (Christian Zagia). Raylan releases his own dog to kill the Blind Man, who is reluctant to kill the animal and traps it in the attic instead. Raylan firebombs the house and leaves with his men and Phoenix. Norman escapes from the burning house, but not before freeing Raylan's dog, who bonds with him. He finds Hernandez's van, arms himself with the weapons inside, and leashes the dog so that it can guide him to the gang's location. At the gang's abandoned hotel hideout, Raylan tells Phoenix that he is her real father, confirming it by showing they both have a streak of white hair on the right side of their head. Raylan reveals that Phoenix's real name is Tara and introduces her to her mother Josephine (Fiona O'Shaughnessy), who is alive but terminally ill. Her mother explains that she accidentally triggered the fire eight years ago while cooking meth. The accident exposed her to lethal chemicals, poisoning her internal organs. Raylan abducted her not out of love but because they need a new heart for her mother. Phoenix is drugged and taken to a makeshift operating room, where a back-alley Surgeon (Steffan Rhodri) explains that his lack of proper equipment means he will have to remove the heart while Phoenix is fully conscious. The Blind Man causes a blackout, stopping the surgeon from extracting the heart. Raylan orders his men to investigate, but they are ambushed and killed by the Blind Man. Raul is against Raylan's plan and decides to help the Blind Man find Phoenix. Norman intercepts Raylan, his wife, and the surgeon at the hotel's empty swimming pool. The Blind Man kills the surgeon, and struggles with Raylan, but Raylan's dog interferes and turns on his owner. In the struggle, Raylan accidentally shoots and kills his wife, causing her to activate her electric chair, sending her towards the empty pool with Phoenix handcuffed to it. The Blind Man gouges out Raylan's eyes and leaves him for dead and saves Phoenix. Severely wounded, he tells Phoenix that everything Raylan told her was true, confesses his various crimes, including murder and rape, and tells her that she is better without him and to leave him. Raylan, despite his injuries, appears and stabs the Blind Man. Before he can slit the Blind Man's throat, Phoenix kills Raylan with a machete. She tries to help the Blind Man, but he responds that she already has saved him. After the Blind Man dies, Phoenix leaves the hotel and heads to a children's home she saw when she was running errands with Hernandez. She approaches children playing outside the home and introduces herself as Phoenix. Also starring Rocci Williams as Duke, Bobby Schofield as Jared, and Adam Young as Jim Bob. Lang goes from a frightening blind man to a slightly more sympathetic character with a good sense of hearing, he is certainly less evil this time than the drug gang, and the little girl is pretty good. First it was a robbery gone wrong, this follow-up goes a completely different direction to a kidnap and a nasty plot to steal a little girl's heart, but again the perpetrators get more than they bargained for. This sequel is much more violent and darker in tone, I don't know if it's as engaging or clever, I can see why it has had mixed reviews, but it's a reasonable horror thriller. Worth watching!",Don't Breathe 2
4,BA_Harrison,Better than the first one.,6,15 October 2021,"Note to self: when building a 'panic room' for one, don't make it water-tight, difficult to open from the inside, and leave a grille at the top big enough for, say, a hosepipe, for example. Yup, the plot for Don't Breathe 2 isn't quite as water-tight as the individual panic room that features in the movie, with several weak points where the whole shebang threatens to burst apart at the seams. But hey, if you can accept such flaws as 'not staying to ensure a character is dead so they can't come back and kill you later', then this sequel can actually be a lot of fun, especially if you enjoy brutal on-screen violence, of which there is plenty.Stephen Lang returns as The Blind Man, an ex-Navy Seal who has developed heightened senses to compensate for his lack of sight. He has a young daughter, Phoenix (Madelyn Grace) who he keeps on a tight leash (metaphorically speaking), afraid that something bad might happen to her. Which it does. It turns out the blind man isn't really her father; he rescued her from a fire when she was very young and has been looking after her ever since, lying about being her daddy. Now her real parents want her back, but not because they miss her: mommy, a drugs chemist with a dodgy ticker, needs her daughter's healthy heart so she can keep on cooking up illegal pharmaceuticals.As a fan of all things splatter, I really liked the brutal action in Don't Breathe 2 - it's hard hitting and good 'n' gory - but I also enjoyed the total absence of a good guy. Obviously, Phoenix's parents are badduns, but The Blind Man is, in his own words, a killer, a rapist, a monster. It makes a nice change from having an obvious hero to root for: all you can hope for is that Phoenix, real name Tera, makes it out alive, and at times, it looks unlikely. As bleak and as nihilistic as all of that sounds, the film isn't without a sense of humour, albeit as black as it comes: the mother saying thank you to Phoenix and blowing her a kiss as they are prepped for surgery is hilarious.",Don't Breathe 2
5,CinemaSerf,Better than adequate sequel.,7,15 September 2021,"Despite myself, I actually rather enjoyed this. Certainly the plot is pretty far-fetched, but once the film gets up a head of steam, it is quickly paced with some well placed jump scenes that work quite well. Stephen Lang is effective as the blind fella, trying to rescue his ""daughter"" from her long-lost family, and is especially so once we find out just quite why they are so keen on re-uniting. Madelyn Grace is also quite competent as the young girl ""Phoenix"" and I found Fiona O'Shaughnessy's particularly odious ""mother"" character quite detestable too. Not great, no, but kills an hour and a half easily enough and reminds you to always honour your dog - or else!!",Don't Breathe 2
6,zardoz-13,A Half-Baked Sequel With Some Surprises,7,7 September 2021,"The message in co-writer & director Rodo Sayagues' above-average sequel ""Don't Breathe 2"" is don't mess with a blind man. Stephen Lang reprises his memorable role as the indestructible Norman Nordstrom, the blind homeowner in Fede Alvarez's ""Don't Breathe"" (2016), and he is the only character from the original movie. This gruesome, heavy-handed, far-fetched follow-up must have been a nightmare for its focus group. Nobody remotely qualifies as a role model in the macabre Fede Alvarez & Rodo Sayagues screenplay. Unfortunately, this violent, gritty, nail-biting suspense thriller lacks the infinite imagination of its frightening, claustrophobic predecessor. Indeed, the blind guy in ""Don't Breathe"" was a murderer, a kidnapper, and a rapist. Although hardly a poster boy for any cause, Nordstrom's zeal for revenge motivated his behavior. Not only had a reckless motorist killed his daughter in a car accident, but her lawyer also had used loophole in the law to exonerate her. Consequently, Norman kidnapped and impregnated her in hopes of siring a replacement daughter! Inexplicably, for the sequel, Alvarez and Sayagues have rehabilitated the former Navy Seal blinded by shrapnel in the Gulf War. Moreover, they have made him over into a kind-hearted but grumpy old guy with a soft spot for dogs. Nordstrom emerges as far less villainous than the cretinous goons with whom he tangles in this white-knuckled, R-rated, 98-minute sequel. Lang's compelling performance as the ""Don't Breathe"" villain ferreting out the burglars in his home was unforgettable. Alas, this same character struggles to redeem himself as a father figure raising an eleven-year-old girl whose fate hangs in limbo. While ""Don't Breathe 2"" qualifies as far less straight-forward than its forerunner, it is far more complicated. The wholly despicable villains this time around are depraved tweakers. The meth-heads' leader has been searching for his own long-lost daughter. Quite by accident, early in the story, he finds her and sets out to bring her home to her mom.""Don't Breathe 2"" takes place eight years after ""Don't Breathe."" Raylan (Brendan Sexton III of ""Russian Doll"") and his crackhead wife (Fiona O'Shaughnessy of ""The Halo Effect"") were cooking up meth when an explosion destroyed their basement lab and flames wreathed their house. Suffering grievously during the inferno, Raylan's wife inhaled smoke and flames. Although she survived, her heart as well as her lungs were permanently impaired. Now, she needs a heart transplant or she will die. Her doctors insist a blood relative must be donor. Once he has served out his eight-year prison sentence for meth, Raylan combs Detroit for their missing daughter. Miraculously, Raylan lucks up and finds his daughter, Phoenix (newcomer Madelyn Grace). Our eleven-year-old heroine doesn't remember either her mom or her dad. Apparently, Norman discovered the urchin in the charred remains of Raylan's house. Afterward, the blind man took her home and nursed her back to health. No, Norman never adopted her. Meantime, he teaches Phoenix how to survive in this ugly world and rarely lets her go out on her own alone. The only person Norman trusts is a former U. S. Army Ranger, Hernandez (Stephanie Arcila of ""The Aliens""), who keeps him stocked with supplies. Hernandez persuades him to let her take Phoenix into the city for a girl's day out. As far as Phoenix knows, she has no relatives. Raylan is surprised when he stumbles across her. Naturally, the little girl doesn't trust Raylan and evades his clutches because Norman's intimidating Rottweiler Shadow came between Raylan and her. Later, Raylan and company tail Hernandez to Norman's two-story home. Tragically, Hernandez isn't around long after she takes the impressionable little girl back to Norman. One of Raylan's fiends buries a hammer in her skull and kills her.The first thing Raylan and company do before they break into Norman's house is lure Shadow out on a wild goose chase. Eventually, Norman leaves the house and searches for Shadow. Tragically, he finds the poor Rottweiler sprawled in its own blood in the wilderness. Our white-haired hero returns to his house and clashes with the tweakers. Norman gets sliced up quite a bit in the process. Scrambling into the basement, Phoenix conceals herself in a compact metal cabinet with a steel grille for a lid. One of Raylan's henchmen floods the cabinet and dangles two live electrical wires inches above the water line. He threatens to electrocute Phoenix unless she bails out. About this time, Norman shows up and starts whittling down Raylan's thugs. Unfortunately, Raylan's henchmen overpower Norman, catch Raylan's daughter, and bombard Norman's grand, old, wooden mansion with flaming Molotov cocktails. Norman barely escapes from the raging conflagration. At one point, Raylan had turned loose his own dog to prowl the premises for our hero. Norman had a chance to kill Raylan's dog, but he lets the canine live. After Raylan and company leave, Norman puts Raylan's hound on a leash and lets the dog lead him to Raylan's hang-out in a condemned motel. Raylan and his thugs do their best to kill the blind man, but a resilient Norman survives all attempts. Warning: don't exit the theater as the end credits roll, otherwise you'll miss a critical end scene.""Don't Breathe"" spawned this problematic sequel because it coined $157 million on a measly $10-million budget. Imagine our young heroine's surprise when she discovers that the family reunion she has dreamed about will be short-lived because mom desperately needs her heart and father needs mom to keep cooking up meth for their livelihood. Sayagues and ""Don't Breathe"" lenser Pedro Luque have done a splendid job of evoking fear, especially when Phoenix discovers to her horror that she has been lined up as the donor who will provide her dying mom with a new lease on life. Whew!",Don't Breathe 2
7,trashgang,the magic of the original one is gone,7,11 October 2021,"Sequels, always in for a discussion. Take this one for example. The first flick I gave it a 9 but here the surprise of the blind man is gone, in fact the whole magic of the first one is gone.But still it isn't a bad flick. Here and there it lacks a bit of suspense but when the fights and killings are on, it's gore galore.If you haven't seen the first one you surey will ike it but as a sequel as said it lacks here and there with the surprise.Gore 4/5

8,mm-39,Not as good as the first!,6,1 September 2021,"Don't Breathe 2 is the prequel for Don't Breathe. There is the daughter who is not the blind guy's daughter with a plot twist of who's evil and not! Well there is some scares and chases. Yes there is evil plans and a plot twists. Well directed and acted, but missing the strong story of the original. Don't Breath 2 is just another part 2 movie. Forgettable but watchable.6 stars.",Don't Breathe 2
9,deloudelouvain,Watchable but not as good as the first one.,6,7 November 2021,"Sometimes sequels are better than the original but that's not the case for this one. It's entertaining though, but you have to have a high tolerance for scenes that aren't very plausible. A blind guy and a kid taking the mickey of a bunch of hardcore thugs, it's a bit far fetched if you get what I mean. That said, if you can pass that, there's enough good bloody scenes to make it an enjoyable horror/thriller. The acting wasn't bad so that's also a positive. It's just the storyline that will put some people off. There will not be another Don't Breathe 3 if you ask me, and if there is I'm sure the quality will go down again.",Don't Breathe 2
10,thesar-2,Breathing New Life,7,15 August 2021,"You could Purge 1 & start here. But, why?Part 1 was a refreshing restart in horror, especially when the grand majority lately are cheap, jump-shot ghost stories. I loved the first one and I REALLY liked this one as well. This is in the same realm of Purge 1-2, Collector 1-2 and Strangers 1-2 where all four series had home invasion horror as the 1st movie and the follow-up on a whole new level.Right off the bat, I have to get a few things off my chest. I HATED the filter used here. It's mostly brown, tan or in-between. This was NOT a pretty movie to look at. Considering the subject matter and the John Wick-number of bad guys dominating the script, I can see why they wanted to make it look ugly. But, that doesn't change the fact it looks bland and boring.Also, no spoilers, but what the second dog does is enormously far-fetched. You'll have to suspend your disbelief there for the climax to happen. And while we're on that dog, the other major thing it does is as equally unbelievable. But, again: plot.And speaking of plot, from the cold open's important event to present day, there's an eight-year gap. But you wouldn't know that with how the characters look or act or provide exposition. It's as if this whole movie took place inside a weekend.But, the rest of the movie? Oh, hell, this kicked ass and SHOULD be seen with part 1 despite not having to and they really couldn't be further apart.A house explosion leads The Bad-Blind Man from the original film and girl to go live in an isolated house where the Man trains her his old Navy Seal survival skills so he doesn't lose another daughter like he did prior to #1. But, some REAL BAD MEN would like to take her for something very bad. The Bad-Blind Man has other plans for those men. Annnd, should we root for him?There. I gave you a synopsis without spoilers and believe me, that's only about 10% of this movie. So much more for you to learn, explore and jump a mile when it happens. Also: No one is safe, sadly. This IS an all-around cutthroat film.I would say: if you liked the first one, you should see this. But, frankly, they're so far apart in tone, atmosphere and locations, it's like it's a completely different movie. That said, yes, you CAN breathe new life into an already fresh idea/horror franchise.***Final Thoughts: The tagline to Mel Gibson's Payback kept coming to mind throughout this entire movie: ""Get Ready to Root for the Bad Guy."" Because...wow. The ratio of bad to good-hearted people here is almost outrageously comical.",Don't Breathe 2
11,Edvis-1997,6,6,24 August 2021,"I wanted to like it more but I couldn't. Let's say it was really good idea, main plot might be very interesting to watch but then... Timing and plot jumps made it more comedy than a horror movie. It had so many unrealistic timing scenes that I couldn't even count on my fingers. Starting from the beginning when the real father somehow been at burnt place at the same time as his daughter. Then scenes with shooting, fighting,the same guy operating girl that was shown on TV,electric turned off at exactly moment, wheelchair moving... I had to even check if that wasn't fantasy movie. Another bad thing about this movie was scenes without logic. When this blind guy told girl to hide in a box? Like what? Hide in a box where encounters can drown or shoot you through those holes... Electric wires never touches water even considering girl going under and above in that water which should raise volume and touch it. How that makes any sense? Blind guy asks dog to show where it lives... Like what was that? What if that dog lives over 100 or 200 miles from him, how does he know how much time he needs to walk. I can't even talk about the ending. Blind guy finally dies and girl goes to orphanage and asks another girl if she can joins them? Huh... what... Even considering it had a lot of mistakes/cons I can't say it was bad movie. I've watched it today and it wasn't that bad to kill time but nothing more. Somewhere about average but raised it a little bit considering it was my first movie at Cinema after lockdown, lol.",Don't Breathe 2
12,ops-52535,a hide and seek...,8,5 September 2021,"Horror thriller with gory elements that youll feel in your guts, is my immediate response to ''dont breath 2''.A fantastic production design, location outfitting, brilliant light and soundwork, combined with a harsh filmography and spiced up by a enthralling score makes this even better than the first of the consept. And there will be a 3rd edition, so hold your breath till then...the acting could be scrutinized up and down, but its far above average for a horrorslasher, so have a look, you wont regret it if you like films made around confined and limited spaces thinks the grumpy old man. Its a must see for every enthusiast of the genre.",Don't Breathe 2
13,UniqueParticle,Rare occasion where the sequel is on par with the original,9,17 August 2021,"Don't Breathe 2 didn't need to happen but with the way the first ended I'm happy the story was continued. It's more grotesque, just as dark in tone if not even more so, the terror is so well done, cast is solid enough and entertainment value should be appreciated! I love these morbid wildly violent movies so much so that I want to own when available. Probably made it even better that Fede Alvarez was part of the crew since he directed the first one. Stephen Lang did so great as the blind man that has to deal with a new group of home invaders and a little girl he care-takes. Love or support my thoughts I highly recommend Don't Breathe 2 to horror fans!",Don't Breathe 2
14,cruise01,Entertaining sequel with a twist.,7,15 August 2021,"3.5 out of 5 stars.Dont Breathe 2 is a pretty fair action horror film that surprisingly was an entertaining sequel. And the writers managed to make it happen without ruining it. The plot follows the blind man (Stephen Lang) who is now living with a young girl Phoenix (Madelyn Grace). When a group of thugs break in his house. And kidnap Phoenix. The blind man goes on a hunting spree. Hunting each bad guy to save the girl.Interesting plot. There is a twist that works. And a predictable third act. Which does leave you questioning if you can have sympathy for Stephen Langs character. The thrills are there. Some characters deaths can be brutal. The music score works well with the film.Stephen Lang is menacing. Madelyn Grace is a new addition. And Brendan Sexton III playing the gang leader. Who is forgettable.Overall, it is an entertaining sequel which managed to work with the twist they give it. The plot is forgettable once it is over.",Don't Breathe 2
15,eddie_baggins,A dreary sequel,2,30 September 2021,"A surprise hit in 2016, horror/thriller Don't Breathe made use of its high concept scenario of a home invasion gone wrong when the intruders face off against a seemingly decrepit blind man only to discover his anything but innocent and hapless but if there was ever a horror film that didn't need a sequel it must have surely been Fede Alvarez's feature that is here returned for the trepid Don't Breathe 2.This time handing the reigns over to first time director Rodo Sayagues, Alvarez takes a back seat role here as this unnecessary sequel takes a much more thriller entry approach to proceedings, mixed with some revenge action as Stephen Lang's Blind Man/Norman Nordstrom and his young daughter Phoenix (played with some attitude by Madelyn Grace) must use all their skills and expertise to fight off a band of ex-army man who want to take Phoenix from Norman's possession for what could only be nefarious purposes.The first film (which I must admit to not being a huge fan of) at least had some thrilling moments and built a lot of tension up from Nordstrom haunting his unwanted house guests but this sequel really has zero moments of dread or suspense outside of a well-filmed tracking shot moment when Brendan Sexton III's Raylan's gang of criminals first enter Nordstrom's house and from there as the film filters into a more revenge thriller mode, Sayagues feature fails to make a mark outside of some gory moments and Lang trying his best to make the most of a dire situation.It's arguable that the film here is damned if it did and damned if it did not in regards to rehashing what has come before it and it would've been hard for Sayagues and the character of Nordstrom to go through another bout of a full length feature centered around him taking it to a group entering his humble abode and while its interesting that this time around the tale tries to paint Nordstrom of more of an anti-hero than genuine evil villain committing terrible crimes, you wonder why on earth your supposed to care about such a vile man or his quest to unleash some form of justice against some even worse human beings.Final Say -Without any scares and with a sense of sameness without the surprise, Don't Breathe 2 is about as pointless as sequels come regardless of genre, with it already past due that Nordstrom and his antics retire for good.1 tube of super glue out of 5.",Don't Breathe 2
16,Tweetienator,Somewhere Lost in So-So-Land,5,2 September 2021,"Well, the first one was solid entertainment despite some flaws (how to beat a guy who depends on his hearing only? Easy, you make lots of noise: put the wash machine, radio and whatever is available on), the sequel is in some parts (some good action scenes) good too. The first I rated 6, this one gets only a rate of 5 (first one got a point more for originality). Final words: if the first one was a solid one for you, you may try this one too - it's dark, it's violent and got some crazy twist in the end, but of course, how the old man moved in unknown territory and killed those dudes is even more unrealistic as some of his actions in the first one.",Don't Breathe 2

One can easily make out what is going on.This time one really feels sorry for the character of Stephen Lang.The movie has a major flaw but that doesn't stop it from being an intense thriller.The flaw - Hernandez asks Phoenix whether she wants to visit her dead mother/burnt house.Now if Hernandez was a local fella, she shud have known that the house belonged to some drug dealers.Also why wud the blind man tell Phoenix that the burnt house was their old house.",Don't Breathe 2

19,jtindahouse,A very different experience to the first - still good though,8,3 September 2021,"It's hard to remember a sequel going in as different of a direction to the original as 'Don't Breathe 2' did. It's been 5 (long) years since that film came out but if I recall correctly 'Norman Nordstrom' was a pretty bad dude. And to be fair he may very well still be a bad dude in 'Don't Breathe 2' but he is also undoubtedly the protagonist. Also to be fair a lot of people may well have seen him as the protagonist in the original. I'm confused, are you? Good. Let's move on.I like that this time around the bad guys are some seriously bad dudes. They are smart, organised and viscous. They are a genuine match for 'Nordstrom'. We see the film from 'Nordstrom's perspective this time around and he seems a lot less superhuman and powerful because of it. It was an interesting dynamic switch. I also really enjoyed the additional character of 'Phoenix'. At first I thought this was no type of film to bring a child into, but they proved me wrong. She was great.I have thoroughly enjoyed both of the 'Don't Breathe' movies, but not to the extent that I've hoped to. It's such an awesome premise but it always feels like they leave some of the best stuff on the cutting room floor. I wanted things to get really messed up here and for the revenge aspect to be highly memorable and thrilling. It was enjoyable, but it won't stick with me. Nonetheless though it's a very watchable little action/suspense/horror and one that I would recommend.",Don't Breathe 2
20,billcr12,Plot holes galore,5,14 September 2021,"The first film was much better than this sequel. Stephen Lang is again excellent as the blind ex Navy Seal with some anger management issues. Unfortunately, the story is ridiculous. Lang is taking care of a little girl who he protects from society. Somehow, a group of bad men are in pursuit of her for unknown reasons. When the it is explained, it makes no sense whatsoever. After five years I will have to watch the first one again to figure out parts of the sequel. I am sure a third one will be on the way eventually.",Don't Breathe 2
21,stevendbeard,From Villain To Hero,8,15 August 2021,"I saw ""Don't Breathe 2"", starring Stephen Lang-Mortal Engines, Conan the Barbarian_2011; Madelyn Grace-Grey's Anatomy_tv, Z Nation_tv and Brendan Sexton 3-Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, Seven Psychopaths.This is a sequel to the 2016 hit but with a difference. Stephen was a villain in the first movie but more of a hero in this one. It takes place several years after the first movie and Stephen is raising an orphaned girl, Madelyn-she even calls him dad. She survived a house fire and Stephen is a little over protective of her, even home schooling her-big difference from his persona in the last movie.

DON'T BREATHE 2 illustrates why someone walking down a Motor City sidewalk with a small cooler is more than likely a courier transporting a vital bodily organ stolen from a freshly-murdered corpse intended for a back alley transplant operation to be performed by a defrocked surgeon without the benefit of any anaesthesia, nurses, medical monitors or basic hygiene. This film recounts how arson has replaced baseball as Motown's main municipal pastime, given that most of the DFD personnel have quit in recent years due to the chronic lack of bath tissue at their stations. Detroit's police chiefs always are more interested in making personal gubernatorial runs than in solving homicides, so this blighted region perennially vies with Mexico for having the distinction of the lowest conviction rate for murderers in the known world. DON'T BREATHE 2 is not exaggerating a single bit as it depicts Detroit's chaotic mayhem and unbridled vicious violence.

24,kevin_robbins,This is a horror fans dream movie,9,2 September 2021,"Don't Breathe 2 (2021) is a movie the wife and I caught in theatres last weekend. The storyline follows Norman Nordstrom as he lives isolated from a society that is falling apart. He protects his little girl and keeps her from local schools and hoodlums. Her curiosity puts his endeavors at risk. One day his little girl is seen in the city and a group of kidnappers follow her home. The kidnappers really don't know how challenging their task is gonna be. This movie is directed by Rodo Sayagues in his directorial debut and stars Stephen Lang (Avatar), Madelyn Grace (Grey's Anatomy), Brendan Sexton III (Boys Don't Cry), Rocci Williams (Wrath of Man) and Adam Young (Sex Education). The storyline and settings for this are way better than they should be. There's a subtle post apocalyptic feel to it with excellent violence and gore that reminded me of a slightly toned down Hobo with a Shotgun. The premise, once it's revealed, is crazy and over the top goodness. The movie starts with two fantastic kill scenes and hits the ground running. The final couple kills are cinematic gold. Loved the special effects and use of various props for their kill scenes. This is a horror fans dream movie that is an absolute must see. I'd score this an easy 8.5/10 and strongly recommend it.",Don't Breathe 2

28,Pairic,Savage Thriller,7,18 August 2021,"Don't Breathe 2: The Blind Man, Norman (Stephen Lang) is back, eight years after the events in DB1. He's looking after a young girl, Phoenix (Madelyn Grace) who survived a fire, posing as her father, training her in escape techniques. There are organ-leggers about and a gang comes after Phoenix killing a friend of Norman's and laying siege to their home. Things turn out to be more difficult than they anticipated. Some really savage violence as people are stabbed, shot, impaled with pitchforks, burned to death and heads battered in with shovels. Well staged scenes as Normans hands crash through a window and grab a crook, the hunts through the house and other buildings are impressive as Lang uses his other senses to thwart the gang members. Grace puts in a good performance with not just her hide and escape skills but also her ability to use violence. The bleak urbanscape of Detroit has a Post-Apocalyptic feel to it and it seems plausible that organlegging would occur there. This isn't as good as Don't Breathe (not as much tension) but it is satisfying thriller with some interesting twists.

30,masonfisk,LIKED IT BETTER THE FIRST TIME BUT LANG DOES PLEASE...!,6,8 September 2021,"Stephen Lang returns as the vengeful blind man in this current release. Surviving the events from the first film finds him 8 years later raising a little girl (picked up by him as a survivor of a house fire) in tactical skills just in case something happens (da...da...da!). Lang supplants his income by growing plants for a landscaping firm & since the daughter, played by Madelyn Grace, is feeling the pangs to go to school (she's been home schooled) but Lang's apron strings on her are tight. Letting her spend the day w/the landscaper, played by Stephanie Arcila, Grace comes in contact w/a shadowy figure in a restroom, played by Brendan Sexton III (welcome back!) so the moment Grace is dropped off at Lang's, the clock begins ticking as a pickup full of men creep around the perimeter of Lang's property (dispatching a departing Arcila right away) which becomes an inverted rehash of the narrative of the first film but w/Lang being pursued by the men due to Sexton's assertion he is Grace's true father. As the action leaves one location (Lang's home is burned down) to another (using Sexton's abandoned dog, Lang finds the dog's origins) where his preternatural hearing & sense of touch helps tip the fight to his favor or does it? A lot of good ideas are taken to their full fruition as the story tends to set up something but lazily pay off on it w/the attempt to have that one shocking scene (which brought down the house in the first film) doesn't quite do the trick here. Fede Alvarez, who co-wrote the script here w/Rodo Sayagues switches places as Sayagues directs here where the same pace & taut plotting is evident but I think a few more passes at the screenplay would've made this more of a winner than an also ran.",Don't Breathe 2

32,rgkarim,"More Action Than Horror, Holding Your Breath For More Thrills than Skin Chills",7,14 August 2021,"LIKES:More of a Story:
The first film had a twist with some hints of a tale in terms of what got him to be the cranky man with secrets. However, the sequel expands a little more and adds a bit more flare and polish to the story, helping add a little mystery, depth, and closure on some of the loose ends. All the villains have a little more connectivity, and there is a bit more purpose behind all the darkness that is to come and helps guide the sequences and keep the pace at the level of exciting that thrillers thrived on. I liked the new direction they took with it and felt the adaptation was very good.Good Acting:
A good movie has a good cast who can bring all the characters to life in all their humanity, flaws and strengths. Stephen Lang is the headliner of the movie and though not quite as dynamic as the first entry of his character, Lang manages to take the ""evolution"" of the character into a believable role. A combination of quiet intensity, intense ferocity, and even a bit of self-loathing all work to show off the deeper dive into his character and question his past vs his future. The added levels help add a realistic quality to the elite role and makes you wonder what this ordeal will lead in his journey. Young actress Madelyn Grace impresses in this performance, a child that is stuck between desire of normalcy, vulnerability, and strength demanded of her father can be quite a difficult challenge. And yet she accomplishes portraying all three demanding qualities to a level that is again believable, balanced, and perfectly suited for what the role sked of her. The screams, the crying, and all the other emotions were tightly controlled and really showed how both in control and out of control she was in the whole situation. As for the rest of the crew, the band of bad guys all have their quirks and while they all share a common element, they all had that unique fervor to help them stand out. The leader of the group in particular was the heaviest handed of the bunch, and involved a lot of psyche switching that really captured the insanity contained in the primary antagonist.The New Twist:
Like the first film, there was that moment that had us all horrified about the lengths Lang's character went that sort of stuck with most who had seen the film. Well, Don't Breathe continues the trend and the new twists that come in may be a bit eccentric, but certainly have that level of shock and skin crawl the first movie held. It involves all the characters this time, connecting a lot of story components together and ushering the movie into the third act of suspense. It fits right into the universe of Don't Breathe and seeing just how dark they were willing to go, offers some potential horrors for any future installments int his world. Fortunately, the twist still has enough censorship to not cross the borders of inhumane that other films enjoy.The Thrills:
The biggest point of why most people are going to this film is for the thrills that the first movie captured so well in the pursuit of the truth.. Don't Breathe 2 took the thrills in a new direction, dropping the horror element and focusing more on an action thriller vibe this time around. The use of strategic fighting, traps, and reliance on the other sense are all there, weaved dynamically throughout the movie as Norman strikes at his attackers. Though a tad cheesy at times, our writers put a nice use of the other senses to help gauge how to take out the big bad guy and I loved the resourcefulness they baked into the script. Imagine almost like the Equalizer, meeting Rambo and you've got a nice idea of what I saw in this film. Even better, the movie avoids escaping into the realm of invincible syndrome, allowing our heroes to not be untouchable, but rather adapt. If there is an injury, it sticks, and we have to see the patchwork process they have to do for getting to the next bout. The writers took a trick out of some of the drama playbooks in this one, and shows that not everything is going picture perfect, a nice little twist to keep things engaging and mitigate the predictability that sometimes plagues thrillers.DISLIKES:Violence towards animals:
It's one of my cardinal rules and this movie sometimes crosses the line of unnecessary aggression to the animals. While not as bad as some other movies with pointless animal twists, this film does sometimes go a little too far given my personal preferences.A little cheesy at times:
I said it above, and though the realism is better, there are some points where the theatrics are a bit eccentric to eye rolling levels. Sometimes it has to do with how quickly some of the characters recover, namely the bad guys while the others are indeed limping from the fight. Sometimes it has to do with this supposedly trained young girl, surprisingly not pulling out moves she has been taught, even though she shows some impressive displays moments before. Other times, it has to be where the use of the senses becomes almost Daredevil like without the Marvel Universe dimensions to explain it. Cool at times and out of place at others, the inconsistency is the real biter for me and some ironing out could have helped keep the patterns I was enjoying.The ending fights:
Imagine you've watched all the fights of clever ingenuity and savagery. You've seen the protagonist lured into fits of rage and have to compensate for his weakness as he tries to accomplish his missions. And then once the ending starts to build up with a rather savory fight, you suddenly drop it for an impressive move, but that is much different than what we've got. That's what happens at the end of Don't Breathe 2. Despite all the prolonged moments we've seen, the ending suddenly condenses their decisions into a moment that was kind of disappointing given all the potential he could have had. While realism still plays in terms of his familiarity with his own battlefield, vs the secondary locations, I kind of felt we could have had a few more moments of hunting that suspense of disbelief could have been appropriately applied, after all he does happen to find what he needs at the opportune moment. That would have really helped utilize the random intros in the third act of the movie and help extend the ""fun"" of the movie. It's probably my main issues with the movie alongside the rather lackluster finish of some of the other antagonists that are in this film.Attempting to love a man with a checkered past:
The truth is that if you know the history of the character you are going to have a hard time empathizing with the monster he calls himself in the trailer. We all have our sinful pasts and the movie tries to wave that banner of redemption and work towards forgiving of our past with an honest start. That lesson is great, but... it's executed only half heartedly in favor of still showing the thrills and the darkness they require. I feel for the man, and can relate to the fear of loss of control that he has been quoted in the past, but story group has more work to do to really execute the redemption pathway that movies like Rambo have done better (not counting Last Blood). A little more of that and perhaps more time with the characters who help him could have improved the film.The Ending Story:
No spoilers, but the ending sort of wraps up in a manner that I had hoped I had not seen coming. While the ending is satisfying to a degree, the movie again kind of flops on the execution and quickly sums things up with little finesse. I asked myself questions about a certain character and realized that I had to wait for the credits to finish to get that answer. It suggests a continuation despite the satisfactory conclusion they did, and this may be exciting to some, but I would have loved for them to give a bang of an ending and let the movie have that promising ending I was hoping to see.The VERDICT:
Don't Breathe 2 is not a bad sequel at all given the evolution of the character and story they were shooting for. Gone is the horror element of the film that we had in the first film, but in its place is an action thriller that takes elements of the first film and applies them to a new setting. I loved the continuation and evolution of the protagonist, the setting that utilizes the blind aspect super well, ad a new twist that though is different fits very well with the Don't Breathe Universe. Acting wise the cast hits home and gives each character their own quirks, and the thriller aspect utilizes their characters well to help bring the promised genre. However, the movie still drops the ball on a couple of components that could have really pumped this sequel up in quality. The consistency is always something I like to see and at times it fails to keep the elements it incorporated early on. This is especially true when you get to the ending, where things drop rapidly and the suspense of disbelief is a big requirement without the satisfying fights to help it. Finally, the ending itself could have used a little more polish, but the set up for a potential sequel is too strong for the money market so we'll need to see what's up in the future. Overall though, the movie is a fine addition to the thriller and I would give this film a thumbs up for theater visit given the special effects and intensity of the experience.My scores are:Horror/Thriller: 7.5
Movie Overall: 6.5-7.0.",Don't Breathe 2

The issue I had with the first film, was it sounded good on paper, but bad on film. However, with Don't Breathe 2, it didn't look good on paper, but looked good on film. Ironic.The film sees Norman Nordstrom who's living in solitude after the events of the first film 5 years on & lives with his adoptive daughter, Phoenix. But one night, a group of burglars break in & Normans old habits come back to haunt him as he tries to protect the one thing he loves. However, the reasoning for the intruders break in reveals a surprising revelation with a sinister undertone.I found the film to be better than the first easily. The story is better, there's no plot holes or dumb plot conveniences & it's more enjoyable & less annoying. To make it better, it's an 18+ & features plenty of gory, graphic moments to please us gore hounds. The dark revelation near the end was pretty well done & gave you a perspective on who to root for, even though it was pretty obvious who to root for just like the first film, Norman.My issues with the film is it starts off pretty slow, it does take its time to get going before things get juicy, but it's not bad. The deaths could've been more graphic I think. The runtime & pacing were overall consistent (despite the slow start) at 1 hour & 30 minutes.

I'm not kidding.""Ahem, not really. I understand that Don't Breathe was a winner both critically and commercially, but not every low-budget horror flick warrants a sequel. Plotwise, Don't Breathe 2 completely undoes what the writers (Fede Alvarez, who directed the original + Rodo Sayagues, who directs this entry) built with Don't Breathe. It takes a complete 180° - where the hunter is now the hunted - also conveniently forgiving how much of a bad guy our leading man was in the first film. It also does away with dialogue-free, piped up tension that was so effective in the first (except for a few minutes or so) and turns into an action-heavy home-invasion thriller that's high on the gore factor.The new characters are thinly written and stop making sense abruptly for the sake of twists. A good twist is one that doesn't ruin the plot but also shocks the viewers - we get a great example of a bad twist in this film. Don't Breathe 2 struggles to deliver on most fronts: the action features too much shaky cam. In a dimly lit setup, it often works against the film. Stephen Lang is undoubtedly an imposing presence, however, it's better when he's the bad guy and not some generic, meth-addicted home invaders.

The Blind Man(Stephen Lang) is living a peaceful life, until his past catches up to him.Don't Breathe 2 is a good movie. However, it's not half as good as its predecessor. Director Rodo Sayagues has given us a film that doesn't do enough to justify its existence. This time around we get more of an action movie, compared to the non-stop edge of the seat thrill ride that Don't Breathe(2016) is. The viewer won't really care about any character in the film, except one. This is in stark contrast to Jane Levy & Dylan Minnette's characters in Don't Breathe(2016).

They are not related whatsoever.The house and the location are different. The Blindman is no longer an Army man, but a Navy Seal. While the original film made the Blindman an innocent victim who lost his daughter to a drunk driver and then had a group of thieves break into his home to steal his cash, this sequel totally takes a left turn. The Blindman is no longer a hero but an anti-hero who kidnapped a little girl. He keeps her isolated from other children her own age. He isn't likable in this new film. The only reason why anyone would care for the blindman is because the girl's birth parents are worse and want to use her for spare parts to fix her meth cooking mother . At least the original film had a plausible story. But this one is completely unrealistic.What a colossal missed opportunity to add to the original story. They should have just hired another actor to play the blindman and gave it a totally different and unrelated movie title.

""Breathe Again""; ""Hold it for a bit longer""; ""Are You Turning Blue Yet?"". But no... we just get a boring old ""2"" at the end!Positives:
Five years is an awfully long time to wait for a sequel! I have to admit I needed to read through my original review for ""Don't Breathe"" and the synopsis on IMDB before I went to see this. But, given that it is a fairly standard schlock-horror home-invasion movie, this is a nicely pieced together movie. Debut director Sayagues, who co-wrote the first film with original director Fede Alverez, moves the action along at a non-stop pace leaving you quite exhausted by the end of the (pleasantly short) 98 minutes.Stephen Lang nicely retreads his monster from the first movie as a besotted but anxious parent. But particularly good I thought was Madelyn Grace who plays the 11 year old Phoenix. I never once thought ""there's a child actress doing a performance"". Great job!Negatives:
It doesn't get many brownie points for originality: the blindness dice was already rolled in the original. So here we get some re-tread scenes of ""the blind man being king"", with red insecticide spray replacing the darkness.It never feels quite right that you are supposed to be cheering on Nordstrom: someone with virtually no redeeming features (other than a love for dogs).The original film had a decidedly icky moment with the whole baster thing. Here we have an equally icky, if ridiculous, plot-twist, taking us into a very dark place indeed. But what is supposed to be a shock-horror moment actually had me in fits of laughter, since all I could think of was a particular scene in ""Monty Python and the Meaning of Life""!Summary Thoughts on ""Don't Breathe 2"": We've been here so many times before that it's almost a (bloody) paint by numbers. But I have to admit that I thought this one was well done, and a cut above the norm. The first movie made $158M on a budget of just $10M. This one has a (restrained) $15M budget, and has already made that back. Good for them. The gore factor makes it not one for the illustrious Mrs Movie Man (who wisely didn't come). But for horror fans out for a nice gory little romp, this has its attractions.And by the way, there is a 'monkey' (post-credit scene in One Mann's Movies speak) in this one.

45,kuarinofu,The funniest dark comedy of 2021,5,3 September 2021,"Don't Breathe 2 is a hilarious grindhouse gorefest. I mean, how can mortal combat with a blind superhuman navy seal rapist maniac versus a gang of human organ trafficking meth-dealing Iraq veterans not be the best thing ever?They completely abandon any logic, realism, or sense in this and just resort to pure violence and dark comedy. And the 'comedy' part is real since all the comedic timings in the film were specifically manufactured to be hilarious.If you want to enjoy this film you should completely distance yourself from the first one. The first one was a tense thriller with an interesting concept, a twist, and a mediocre ending.This one is just madness on steroids.There are no plot holes in this film, it's more like a giant black hole inside it.I really enjoyed it from start to finish. When I saw a low-poly computer-generated puppet escaping from a CG housefire in Serbia I knew this is going to be great. I got the feeling that the gory death scenes came first, and the creators just wrote them into the most implausible story ever created.I'm going to try and imagine what the script looked like.'Thank god the father wasn't smart enough to just take the girl when he first stalked her in the public restroom. Since there are no police or emergency services in this world, he would've been just fine with it. Or was she just lucky, because later on, one of the methhead ex-veterans almost drowned and fried her alive in a metal box (which locks from the inside, but opens easily from the outside), he probably forgot that they actually came for her (as well as he forgot to even try to open it), yet luckily our hero knew that water in the tubing means that the bad guys are doing exactly that (hence the superhuman intellect)? Again, coincidentally a trained killer dog befriended our blind man so he can escape the house fire using the convenient ice cold windows on the greenhouse that was in fact - on fire. Using his superspeed and super awareness our lead navy seal was able to chase them down with the doggo, locate the power switch somewhere just in time to stop his kidnapped pseudo-daughter from being rip open alive (after a hilarious line about taking her heart out WHILE SHE IS STILL BREATHING). Aquaman sonar powers helped out our guy again with no-scoping 3 enemies only to get lucky again cause one of the methheads decided that opening up living kids with a cutter is a no-no. The assumption that he's the only superhero in this universe almost killed our lead when he thought that pushing someone's eyes inside one's skull might slightly annoy a human being, but a well-trained 12 y.o. Girl with a machete passed her final exam. And since the girl is completely prone to multiple violent murders, after realizing that her pseudo-father is a superhuman navy seal rapist maniac, her real father is a supervillain who can operate with his eyes inside his skull, and her mother is not only alive but also a meth cook who thought that a living heart of her 12 y.o. Daughter will save her EVERYONE LIVED HAPPILY EVER AFTER.'I'm laughing out writing this while realizing that these are the actual events that happen. I wish I could see the actual script with all this stuff in it. Truly amazing.Don't Breathe 2 is a good pick for you if you love mindless, senseless b-movie trash with lots of gore. If you expect anything remotely close to the first one - I have bad news for you.P. S. Don't forget the post-credit scene.",Don't Breathe 2
46,Movi3DO,Step down from the first,6,15 August 2021,"Don't mess with the blind man.The sequel to Don't Breathe, which was one of the surprises back when I first watched. The first had a simple concept, but the great execution made for an intense and gripping thriller. So coming into this one, although with a different director, I expected another great thriller.And the movie was pretty decent. Stephen Lang returned as a blind yet skillful man. He was again awesome in his role, showing not only good action, but also some emotion. He was for sure the best part of the movie.The thriller aspect was definitely nowhere near the level of the first, which was a letdown. Since most of the action took place in the dark, sometimes it was hard to see the movement, and the editing didn't help much either. Still, there were still great shots and lightning of Stephen Lang's character that made some scenes intense.Overall, a decent thriller that was a step down from the first. 6/10.",Don't Breathe 2
47,Neptune165,Bring back the Girl from the prequel and make the blind man a Villian and the movie is better,3,5 September 2021,"It should have picked up where the first one left off. What happened to the girl in the first movie, and the possibility of her baby? It's not part 2 it's a different movie, I liked the first one, he was creepy and this one tried to make him a hero. NO! How that little girl being able to hold the dead weight of an adult with 2 feet around the pool? They tried to save her by attempting to kill her, electrocuted her, drowned her?!! The blind guy being more vulnerable to being harmed because he was becoming good was dumb. I didn't nearly like this movie as much as the first because first of all there wasn't as much tension making you want to hold your breath and in the first it was about the people breaking into a home and not somebody trying to survive from the people breaking in which in this movie it's the opposite where it's just a classic home invasion in the first half which I don't like because we see that a lot in movies already.",Don't Breathe 2

The performances are very good, especially that of Stephen Lang who repeats his previous role, the cinematography is great, full of chiaroscuro, the makeup effects are well achieved and the script has good twists of the screw. A good home invasion subgenre movie.",Don't Breathe 2
49,SoumikBanerjee25,"Not Perfect, But a Good Enough Continuation Nonetheless!",6,7 September 2021,"Soon after I found out about the sequel and its proposition; I was beginning to wonder whether it was actually required or not. Owing to the fact that the first part is one of my dearests and the film itself was deemed to be among the very best when it comes to contemporary Horror Thrillers.In general, the idea of a conceivable continuation just freaks me out. If you cast a brief look at facts and figures, there were always been more misses than hits. Thankfully that is not the case out this time. Don't Breathe 2 did stand up to the expectations, at least to some degree!Even if it had perceptible loopholes and a few imperfections; I would still consider this to be a well-executed feature. Very much on-point and purposeful! Moreover, a fine piece of work in several respects of Cinematography and Sound can easily be noticed. The latter one; in particular, as Sound does play a substantial role herein.Technical competencies aside, there was no shortage of Gore, Blood, and Truculence. The makers made sure they fully exploit that R-rating and they did! At the same time, the most impressive thing is they successfully managed to uphold the Suspense all throughout its narrative. No small feat, if you ask me!Performance is another highlighting aspect. And Stephen Lang indeed steals the limelight! Thoroughly believable and a terrific showing all around. And I love how the writers didn't glorify his prior Actions nor they posed him as some Good Guy. I like the fact that his character is extremely self-aware of his past sins, therefore; his road to redemption gets to be far more convincing and relatable.Now I do feel certain plot points come across as a little unusual and far-fetched. It's awfully hard to strike a conversation on the same without giving away any SPOILERS. But I will say this, the third act is comparatively unstable. Matter of fact, It is somewhat convoluted and sloppy in a way.",Don't Breathe 2
50,nathanmanson,The first one was good but this one was better,8,31 August 2021,"This it's self was a completely different film to the first and I think it was better. That's not to take anything away from the first one. I loved the first one but I enjoyed this one a lot more. The thing I liked about this one the most was the fact you're backing the old guy unlike the first one. The ending couldn't have been more perfect. She got her dream of making friends and the old guy could die happy. I think they got this completely right and I don't understand a lot of the bad reviews. The only little thing in this film that could be tweaked was when she was in that lock box and it was filling with water, she could've just pushed the pipe out. She could've also just pushed the electric wire out but I guess she's only a kid. It's also not something to mark and film down for, it was still amazing. Great film with a heart felt ending.",Don't Breathe 2

52,MrDHWong,Takes things in a slightly different direction to its predecessor but falls short of recapturing what made the original so successful in the first place,6,9 September 2021,"""Don't Breathe 2"" is the sequel to the 2016 horror-thriller film ""Don't Breathe"". Once again starring Stephen Lang in the lead role, it takes things in a slightly different direction to its predecessor but falls short of recapturing what made the original so successful in the first place.Eight years after his home was broken into, the blind Gulf War veteran Norman Nordstrom (Stephen Lang) has since moved into an isolated house in a quiet neighbourhood with a young girl named Phoenix (Madelyn Grace). One night, Norman tells Phoenix about her past, claiming that after her parents died in a house fire, he decided to adopt her as his own daughter. A short time later, a gang of criminals break into Norman's house with the intent of kidnapping Phoenix, unaware that this isn't the first time Norman has had to deal with a home invasion.The original ""Don't Breathe"" took me by surprise five years ago. For a modern horror-thriller, it managed to stand tall amongst the usual onslaught of jump-scares and over-the-top gore that's churned out by movie studios on a regular basis. Instead, it relied heavily on creating a tense atmosphere and the unpredictability of its villain to elicit scares, which I believe is one of the best ways to make a film of this kind. This sequel, while still retaining some of these elements, tries to shake things up with a new setting and villain characterisation, however, it only succeeds in small parts.It remains debatable whether we should classify Norman as outright evil, but one thing's for certain; he is not a good person. This man did some terrible things in the first film but at the same time he rightfully acted in self-defence against trespassers on his property. His actions place him in a moral grey area, which sets him up as the anti-hero for the sequel. Although this should allow for some further character development, I don't think the film utilised this opportunity as well as it could have. Most of the time, Norman is shown fighting off his adversaries in a similar way to how he did in the original, which while entertaining to watch, doesn't really show us anything we haven't seen before. We already know he's a war veteran whose blindness is a minor setback for him, but in the eight years (five in the real world) since the events of the first film, he doesn't act any different in the way he handles newer, tougher situations. I would have liked to have seen what Norman had learned from his previous experiences but he more or less just repeats the same techniques as before, only against less sympathetic enemies.Another thing that I really enjoyed about the original was the quality of its directing, which is far better than one would expect. Fede Álvarez weaved us all along in an almost Hitchcockian style as we wonder how Norman is going to react to a certain noise, which can give away someone's very location. Since Norman is blind, it is a requirement that the audience is able to understand what it is like to be visually impaired, and both of these films pulled that off brilliantly. Whether it be something as simple as breathing (hence the title) or ripples from water in a puddle, no noise is unimportant to him. In this film, though, Alvarez takes a backseat as a producer and instead allows co-writer Rodo Sayagues to take his place. Fortunately, Sayagues has a near-identical directorial style, and is correctly able to replicate the right amount of tension wherever it is needed.The one main problem I have with this film is the inclusion of the young girl Phoenix, who is frequently placed in dangerous circumstances. Phoenix is said to be eleven-years-old, so scenes of her reacting to graphic violence like someone's face being smashed in with a shovel left a bad taste in my mouth. If her character were an adult, or at least a teenager played by an adult, this wouldn't be so bad but to see an obvious young child witnessing such brutality feels like a cheap move on behalf of the filmmakers. I understand that her actress Madelyn Grace wasn't seeing this for real but I assume the director likely described what she was supposed to be looking at when the cameras started rolling, which considering her age, would have had a similar impact.Like in the previous film, Stephen Lang's performance as Norman is the main highlight of the whole movie. The way Lang plays Norman as someone who is not only blind, but also a skilled military tactician evokes similarities to John Rambo in the ""Rambo"" films. The key difference here is that Norman is missing one of his primary senses, making his methods of combat much more impressive to watch. Though I still feel uncomfortable seeing a child put through such frightening predicaments, I also think Madelyn Grace did a solid job playing the character of Phoenix. Grace demonstrates even at her young age that she knows when and where to emote correctly, especially during the film's climax. I just hope for her sake that she won't come away too traumatised after this whole experience.Though ultimately unnecessary, ""Don't Breathe 2"" has just enough entertainment value to warrant its existence. I still think the first film was able to stand on its own but considering the way it ended, I suppose it was inevitable that a follow-up would be made at some point. Like with ""A Quiet Place"", I hope the value of the series doesn't become diminished over time with several sequels, like with most other horror franchises. If you loved the original or are simply curious to see more of Norman's character in action, then this continuation should be worth seeing. However, if you didn't care much for it the first time around, it's okay to skip it.I rate it 6/10.",Don't Breathe 2

55,trinaboice,Brutal thriller,6,18 August 2021,"MOVIE TITLE: Don't Breathe 2IN A NUTSHELL:
This action thriller was written by Fede Alvarez and Rodo Sayagues, just like in the first Don't Breathe. This time, however, the directing duties have switched from Alvarez to Sayagues for the sequel. The story takes place years after the first Don't Breathe movie ends. The story is about a blind veteran who must use his military training to save a young orphan from a group of thugs who break into his home.This movie is one of those films that critics hate on Rotten Tomatoes with a low score of 48%, while audiences are getting a kick out of it with a high score of 88%. Comment down below which side you agree with! I'd love to hear what YOU think!THINGS I LIKED:
I absolutely loved Stephen Lang in the movie Avatar and I can't wait for that next movie to come out! Stephen Lang is absolutely a believable retired vet with a certain set of skills needed to protect his own home, even though he's blind.I never saw the first home invasion movie in this franchise, but I hear that the protagonist is a villain. As a fun twist, he becomes an unexpected hero in this one.I love it when movies include Easter eggs. In this film, you see Hernandez (played by Stephanie Arcila) wearing a baseball cap with the production company logo ""Bad Hombre"" on it.I loved the last empowered line of the movie.Young Madelyn Grace did a good job as Phoenix. She's so young and has already had roles in Grey's Anatomy: Season 9 and Bunk'd Check out one of the songs at Tidal Wave (From ""Bunk'd"")
Keep watching after the rolling credits for a bonus scene.Twists. I love twists.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
Super slow, cheesy start.Many scenes are visually dark, as they occur at night or in a dark house. That's going to make it difficult to see for people who will stream this movie on small devices.There's not very much dialogue. What there is of it is pretty basic and sometimes hokey.Many elements of the story are completely ridiculous.The biggest complaint I've been hearing about this film is that the first movie didn't require a sequel.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Kids really shouldn't watch this movie.The protagonist is blind with super creepy eyes.Brutal, SUPER bloody, and gory violence and deaths.Profanity, including F-bombs

57,destroyerwod,"Fun for what it is, maybe even better than the first 1?",7,22 October 2021,"I watched this as part of my Halloween Season movie program because the first one was leaning much more as a horror movie than an action movie. The Blind Man was pretty much a slasher vilain and altough the protagonist were not saints by any means, he was portrayed as the bad guy.When i saw the trailers i was really confuse on how they would make this guy the ""hero"". Not the first time its been done in movies, but often the characters change a lot in the process and here, surprisingly it does not goes too unatural. All he wanted was a daughter, and he got it in this one, so his redemption story arc already started before the movie started.The thing is tough, is that if the first one was based on tension and was more of an horror movie, this one is simply an action movie were they mess with a relative and bad ass hero goes on a quest to save her. The only difference is the guy is blind. That said, altough i liked the first movie, its not that much my usual type so despite my surprise in the change of style and this movie not really fitting that much into ""horror halloween"", i had a lot of fun with it.There is a bit of ""plot coincidences"" where you need to suspend your disbelief but outside of that, its pretty effective and i enjoyed it.",Don't Breathe 2
58,lareval,"Interesting premise, sloppy execution, soulless entertainment (Don't miss the post credits scene)",4,17 August 2021,"The original movie was terrific by itself and ended its story neatly. This sequel turns tables and humanizes The Blind Man to the point of making him much more vulnerable than in the first movie. The idea is curious: Don't Breathe following the steps of Terminator 2. The problem is the execution. The film is a chase full of hits and blood that goes nowhere. Whereas the original had memorable scenes (the basement, the twist, the introduction of Norman), I will not remember any scene of this one. There is another filthy family affair that hurts more than heals, but while the twist is disgusting its storyline goes nowhere too. This movie is entertaining and it's not horrible, but it's soulless and unnecesary in the end. Even its post credits scene reveals itself shy to be brave enough to go ahead with the ballsy conclusion. It seems there will be a third outing. Let's see how it goes...",Don't Breathe 2

You literally can't make a descent horror film without getting slaughtered by couch critics. I didn't think it was that bad. The storyline wasn't the greatest but it worked. It had some brutal kill scenes and the main character was awesome once again. Stephen Lang's performance alone is more then enough reason to check it out. 7 stars.,Don't Breathe 2
60,nikola17,Not Bad I Kinda like this movie more then first one,6,27 October 2021,"If you expect this is be more of horror film, well.... it's more action then to less horror in it if you expect more horror like first one ah your got your ass tricked. And yes I liked how this movie has taken to different direction but still don't understand Blindman is now good guy even he was a evil scary psychopaths' person but hey in this movie now he is good guy forks just avoid first film just watch this so you can pretend he is good guy ouranti hero. I remember I saw first film in theater 5 years ago back in 2016 September I remember brings back those days first film was great experience and it was different it was scary as well but at end of day I enjoyed it, it was 8.10 I liked the way how it was shot, suspense was thrilling at edge of your seat and it was scary as well but end of day it was a one time watch forgotten all about Don't Breathe (2016) until this come out I had watch 1st and 2nd movie. They don't connect to each other strange how story does follow up after 14 years with invasion from 1st film. But hey I wish it was just new story that has nothing to do with 1st film this sequel has nothing to do with girl Rocky (Jane Levy) with her younger sister on run after 1st film ended. This story just follows. Blind Man (Stephen Lang) who lives with a adopted 11 year old girl Phoenix (Madelyn Grace) that was found from street, her parents died that her
birth mother died in a fire in their old house. You have a woman that is friends with Blindman, Hernandez (Stephanie Arcila) that looks after Phoenix. Witch later on you feel sorry Hernandez character sadly wish she was more in it or they could switched her character role to another character to another Mexican guy that didn't decide to hang out with thugs he lives, I reckon Stephanie character should off had switched characters Later on night you thugs former marine thugs Raylan (Brendan Sexton III)) is a main villain he is known for Black Hawk Down, Session 9, El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. They break in house for some reason that I will not spoil film I am writing this review without spoiling it. Main villain wanted to break in his house nothing like first movie hide and seek type just because he is Blind. I like suspense is a lot more better then to first movie in my opinion. But then you get a lot of brutally action scenes pretty fun to watch, wish I saw this at theater but during lockdown this film was gonna show back in August, but sadly it's gonna slaright to 4K,Blu-ray, DVD I saw this on fast tracked from theaters you can get it fromYouTube you can watch it from their I payed 25 bucks for rent. Sadly never got to see this at theater I was pretty upset for that but hey it's government dog move sadly had to miss out Black Widow, Suicide Squad at theater would been amazing and sadly more upcoming movies from theater I hope they will let unvacated people go as well. In this movie you have lots of brutal scenes Blindman goes full on action taking guys one by one with guns, knives brutally way it has tons of action. The cinematography and editing are once again top notch. Action is brutally fun to watch but still their are so many plot holes in film, so many of them it felt weird. I understand this film is different but villain we suppose to hate but now he is a anti-hero we have to like him it's like director and writer wanted to do something different rather then just doing samething like first film or just chasing Jane Levy character. It's hard to like our main character is because if you haven't first film, you goand watch it then you watch this movie hours later it's hard to decided to hate or like character their a lot of bad things about this Blindman he is not saint just like what character Money said just because he is Blind doesn't make him a Saint that character has a fact, only bad thing about Blindman he is Isolating Phoenix is reason because he doesn't wanna lose another daughter because he lost one he doesn't have much freedom sadly to say but I wonder if Phoenix finds out what he really did to all bad things he did in first film I wonder how franchise will go from 3 or 4 or 5 depends on how many will they make?? I really enjoyed sequel it would been fun to see it at theater but sadly it didn't show it because we were in 6th Lockdown, I don't want to be Jabbed just to see a movie its my body, my choice and sadly this year it's been worst just been staying strong, staying humble, this all thing will be over soon sadly I won't see those movies in theater hopefully maybe in December hopefully won't betoo long. But with this movie 6.10 reason why I didn't give it a higher rating because it's better movie I liked action it was fun to watch this and that but it's too strange with Blindman being bad to good as anti villain being a old man Daredevil type or Blind John Wick type lol but I don't know its strange weird but sametime it doesn't put me off movie reason why I put 8.10 for Don't Breathe (2016) because it was different it was suspenseful completely it was more of a horror, but with this sequel I had fun with everything but theirs so many flaws to this movie and it's strange in sametime but I prefer this film a lot more better then to first because at least it's not campy film, at least theirs more to see and seeing Blindman kicking butt so that's why I enjoyed it I can watch first film for horror film but with second film I can watch it for action then less horror I am more of die hard of action then to horror but reason why I gave this a 6.10 just too flaws on story, character direction and making Blindman into a good guy so are meant to forgive him I don't but I rather watch this more then first film I am not kidding look give this movie a shot if you stuck at home with Isolation crap just take a deep breathe and just watch film don't think, don't say, just breathe watch film just give it a shot... I still highly recommded this movie even it has flaws.",Don't Breathe 2

Not watching one didn't really hinder me in seeing this one though. Had I not have seen one I could have still watched this and known I had not missed anything. They were almost like two completely different stories and it was interesting to see the directors imagination set free. The Ranger woman in the beginning was a very cool character and I wish she would have been in the whole movie. Also, this is the first time I have heard miss Grace. Despite me not knowing much about her, I feel like she could have brought more to the table in this movie. She never once said something witty back to the bad guys like ""He is my dad, not you!"" or ""Take that!"". Her character was just not memorable.

Don't Breathe 2 is nothing compared to the first. It does have Stephen Lang and the extreme gore, but it misses what made Don't Breathe (2016) so good: the perspective. The first movie was in the perspective of the robbers, making the film more intense because he's an unpredictable antagonist. In this film, he's the protagonist, which doesn't add to the intensity at all. Everything's reversed, and it just doesn't work because of that.The story and its characters also don't work. There's an addition of a new character, Phoenix, who I couldn't care less about. The story is built around her, which is possibly the worst decision you could make, considering she's the least interesting character in the movie. But when the movie does shift from Phoenix to Stephen Lang, it does get better. The action and gore is there, but once again, the intensity is still missing because I had no personal investment with the characters.This movie is just meh. The characters were overall terrible, except the blind man, and the story holds no personal attachment. This film is a pass from me, unless you like the extreme violence or Stephen Lang.",Don't Breathe 2

director: Rodo Sayagues
starring: Stephan Lang, Brendan Sexton, Madelyn Grace, Stephanie Arcila, Rocci Williams, Bobby Schofield, Adam Young, Fiona O'Shaughnessy etcHiding out for years in an isolated cabin, Norman Nordstrom (Stephan Lang) has taken in and raised a young girl orphaned from a house fire. There Quite existence is shattered when a group of kidnappers show up and take the girl, forcing Norman to leave his safe haven to save her. This was pretty decent, definitely not needed but I still had a fun time with it in places.My first few positives would be the cinematography and gore. The uncomfortable tone built and the great action as well as the building of tension. The film still managed to be visually creative like the first film. Not to the standard of the first instalment, but there were still some very clever uses of Norman's lack of eyesight incorporated into the visuals. With Water and the use of low-key lighting or darkness. I also thought the use of gore was excellent. The film turned up the gruesome gore and kills up a lot which I really liked. It gave the scenes a lot more impact and made Norman a much more intimidating force. The film still managed a very uncomfortable tone, due to the innocence of Phoenix (Madelyn Grace) the threat of kidnap from the villains and how they behaved was very uncomfortable and intense to watch. The film managed to create a different kind of tension in parts compared to the previous instalment. And the film did manage to build that edge of your seat tension with particular scenes. It wasn't as consistent but was achieved well at certain points. Finally, the action was great. The kills were brutal and cleverly incorporated with Norman's blindness. They were Clever, hard hitting and much more brutal this time around.My first few negatives would be the rushed background at the beginning. Lack of character motivation or background. And a lot more lapses in the logic. The film completely rushed how Norman helped Phoenix and it lacked any form of background to their relationship, making it feel very rushed and clunky. And it was oddly explained later which didn't make sense as it could have been done in the beginning to set up a better relationship. What the first film did so well was let the robbers/kidnappers have good background and motivation for what they were doing. This didn't have any of that, and whilst I appreciate they wanted to throw you straight into the action. The characters felt one dimensional and rushed. This was once again later explained with the twists, but they felt slightly too late, and the villains still fell very flat in terms of depth and background. There was a lot more lapses in the logic here. The first film felt very grounded and knew the limits of Norman as a character whilst still making it very tense and entertaining. This all went out the window here and there was too many unrealistic scenes or illogical character decisions that didn't really make sense due to Norman. The film wanted to be bigger and more impactful, but in doing that they sacrificed a lot of the logic.My final few positives would be the interesting dynamic between characters and the dark twists and tone. As well as the great performances and Jumpscares. Plus, the final act was intense. I thought father and daughter dynamic between Norman and Phoenix was interesting. She bought out the more soft and protective side of him, teaching her important life skills, but this was balanced with him being too restrictive and negative towards the outside world. I also thought the film had very dark twists and tone. The twists were completely unexpected and very dark. I commend the film for taking some risks, they were bold and unpredictable and took the film in a completely different and much darker direction. I also thought the Jumpscares were excellent. They weren't predictable or overused like in a lot of horror films. They were startling and unpredictable and really made a big impact. I also thought the performances were very strong from the two leads. Stephan Lang delivered another powerful and menacing performance here. He was just as intimidating and unpredictable as ever and his performance was great. Madelyn Grace was also fantastic here. For such a young actor she showed a lot of promise. She delivered in the intense and emotional scenes, and she was very charming to watch. Finally, the final act was very intense and was very strong. The dark twist made the stakes and tension extremely high, and the brutal action made for a very strong final act that was very well done.My final few negatives would be some of the dialogue, the unneeded ending and unfocused tone. Some of the dialogue was poor, it was very generic and made the villains seem stupid. With some unintentionally funny lines that made the tone off in places. I also thought the ending was very unneeded. I found it very strange creatively to kill of the main character without much of a satisfying arc or real change in his character apart from a realisation of his actions. It was just a very mediocre ending. My biggest issue with the film was how tonally unfocused it felt. It was constantly switching which character to sympathise or connect with, and it was way to inconsistent. The film didn't have a clue what to with its characters, constantly shifting between the usual villain and intimidating character, to sympathising with Norman as an antihero and it just didn't work.Overall, don't breathe 2 is definitely entertaining. And had its creative and tense moments. And I respect that it took some risks with its twists. But it lacked the high tension and inventiveness of the first film. And it never felt it fully knew what it wanted to do with its characters. It was a serviceable sequel but not in the league of the first film.Overall rating 67/100.",Don't Breathe 2
68,aastikhimta,It was fine,6,5 September 2021,The plot was totally different from first part and goes in totally new direction. To me it wasn't a great sequel. The ending was fine. Though it could've been better and I expected a little bit more coz last part was great.,Don't Breathe 2
69,flicklover,The Blind Man as an anti-hero?,6,22 August 2021,"In 2016, Don't Breathe was a solid sleeper hit. A simple, effective, nasty little home invasion horror thriller that was very entertaining. It was inevitable that there would be a sequel after the succes of the first one. What was good about the original film is that it all took place in a dark, dingy home. And of course a really good performance by Stephen Lang as Norman. A blind ex Navy Seal that thwarts the attempted burglary of three would be small time criminals. Lang was very creepy as Norman and we sympathize with him in the beginning of the film. But as things get more violent Norman becomes the villain.When I saw the trailer for Don't Breath 2 it was clear that it would be very much like the first one but it did sort of hint that Norman is the protagonist this time. In the beginning we see that Norman living with an 11 year old girl named Phoenix. Norman is very protective of his daughter to the point where she can barely leave the house. Norman let's Phoenix go out with a friend that takes her into town. We see a gangster stalking the girl and confronts her in the bathroom. Eventually the gangster and his goons go to Norman's house to abduct Phoenix. As in the first film, Norman battles the intruders in his dark house in many violent ways. This sequel has more blood and gore than the original. But it feels less like a horror thriller than an action film even though the violence us bloodier. The difference this time is that Norman is not the villain of the film. He isn't a hero per se but he dies protect Phoenix. But the film does show him being pretty cruel to her in that he oblver protects her to.the point of home schooling and barely let's her out of the house. The thugs ultimately are able to take Phoenix from the house and set it on fire assuming Norman was dead. Of course he isn't and the rest of the film is about Norman rescuing the girl. Even though this is a sequel and hasn't of tge same beats as tge first film it is different in that it feels more like a more violent version of Taken in a way. The original has a twist tgat changed the story midway the the film. This one has a twist but it's less effective. The violence is more brutal and excessive but less impactful than before but the story is compelling enough to keep our interest.The first film is in no way a classic but was certainly memorable for it's premise. This is as most sequels are a repeat of alot of the same elements as its predecessor.A mostly average sequel.Grade: C+",Don't Breathe 2
70,movieman6-413-929510,Unnecessary sequel that chokes the tention moments from the first film,4,22 August 2021,"Don't Breathe 2 is the sequel to the 2016 film Don't Breathe. This sequel is directed, written and produced in part by Rodo Sayagues. This is only the first film he has directed. He also partly wrote and produced the first Don't Breathe film together with the director of the first part Fede Alvarez. Fede Alvarez also returns as co-writer and producer for this sequel.The film takes place several years after the first part. The Blind Norman Nordstrom (Stephen Lang) has retired and lives in a secluded house with the young orphaned girl Phoenix (Madelyn Grace), whom he raised as his own daughter. When Norman is confronted by his past, his peace and the safety of his daughter are at stake.This sequel comes across more as a standalone film, which makes little use of elements from the first part. They only use some moments that are almost the same as moments from the first part, only these moments are shown from a different point of view. So it remains an entertaining, but also unnecessary sequel.The entire film is actually told from this different point of view. In the first part, the story was told from the point of view of three burglars who tried to rob the blind man, but did not know that this man was a war veteran, who did not make it easy for them.This second part makes the danger of the first part more like the hero of the story, who is attacked by criminals who are also after his daughter. This storytelling goes a bit against the first part and loses the tense moments. These are then replaced by more entertaining action scenes.Due to the loss of the claustrophobia aspect, you as a viewer also have less need to be quiet, so that you can talk more during this sequel or just eat your popcorn without being afraid to disturb the silence of the film.Stephen Lang does deliver good acting in the film, only his character is a bit weaker, so that the criminals have a better chance against him. Together with Madelyn Grace, he manages to come across as a father and daughter duo, who are trained to get out of most dangerous situations. The actors who play the criminals come across as a bit too exaggerated cartoon characters, who go after the blind man and his daughter for separate reasons.",Don't Breathe 2
71,leesimon-26357,"Weirdly cheesy, with poorly built characters",6,23 October 2021,"It's so hard to describe some confusing elements without spoiling it, but I would recommend the movie, so I will do my best.What's with the very first scene. Was it supposed to look like the ending of the first one? Where are they? And what was with the reveal for why these people were doing what they were doing? The first one had odious motives, but this is maximum cheese-ball.The characters are not bad, until The Cook is introduced. Then everything is downhill. The action is not as good as the first, nor is the story. There is way less to root for in this one, as well. The action wasn't too bad, but again much better in the first one. This was disappointing overall.Anyone else ready to have this be a series of movies, with completely different cast of 'baddies' and the blind guy as the only recurring character? I'm also onboard for this to get as silly as they can make it with new crews for each movie. And I envision Blindy as becoming more and more like a Mike Myers good guy, who can't die, no matter what.",Don't Breathe 2
72,Darkjak007,1/2 home alone 1/2 daredevil,6,8 November 2021,"Don't breathe two pick up 8 years after the events of the first film. Now the blind man(Stephen Lang) lives a secluded life with his current daughter phoenix and from his perspective everything's going well. Only except for the fact that Phoenix is rather lonely, she wants friends, wants to go to school and have a social life of her own. The matter only get worst when all of a sudden a group of men show up to their house and try to take the girl away. Now the old man has to fight and outsmart this as the sin of his past catches up with him. I'm not gonna say that the movie itself is terrible though for a sequel, that clearly didn't need to happen it does still offer some kind of entertainment. It pushes way further away from the horror and suspense that the first film had in favor of more action and drama. While many of the action scenes are entertaining and the gore is over the top. It's still is kind a hard to have your story set around the blind man as more or less the protagonist/hero this time around. Given what he's done in the past that's not really something You can really be absolved of. You can see where the films kind of tries to introduce someone who is quite possibly worse than him. The wise I said well they do try to hit more and more towards the action genre and so when you have a moment that's supposed to be suspenseful it doesn't really come off suspenseful. There's a bunch of jump scares even more so than the first, I honestly feel just rather tacked on just to be more like boo gotcha. I got the carriers most of them are pretty much dispensable I thought what they say to do with the blind man you'll have the focus of the story is really on the little girl Phoenix I'm really focusing more on what is she think of the situation and how she feels though I have to say she has some training from from the old man but it doesn't really come off as believable but one moment she's under the bed and the next thing you know she's under a dresser and it's like she wouldn't not it doesn't come off be able to move in such a way without being noticed. The choices she makes I honestly wouldn't say that they would come off as rather believable and what she does. It's really more of the first half of the movie where the film where it shines once I get to the second half and start pushing Ward's store the end it honestly feels like they just forced this last section just for the sake of how they wanted to ending on a note.",Don't Breathe 2
73,zac-04879,Just as Much of a Let-Down as 2020's and 2021's Sequels,6,6 September 2021,"Completely opposite to 2016's successful thriller, Don't Breathe 2 takes a focus on the original antagonist's point of view, stylishly obliterating several greedy thieves. Although it's frequently suspenseful and flawlessly intelligent, the writers of this sequel seem to have completely ignored the detailed shock of Don't Breathe. Everyone anticipating a second chapter will be entertained, but thoroughly let down.A sequel was inevitable after the original story of young thieves becoming the victims of a clever blind man's tricks. But rather than focusing on revenge of the blind man or a second break in by the original thieves, fans will feel disappointed at the completely new storyline. It occasionally gets repetitive, but is still enjoyably intense.Stephen Lang returns as the epic character, alongside an entirely forgettable new cast, apart from Madelyn Grace as Phoenix. It's even more gruesome and psychotic than the first one, but is duller and not as easily-gripping. Including some brilliant ideas, Don't Breathe 2 could've and should've been a total blast. Unfortunately, it completely fell short when it came to just a simple element: the plot.If you liked this review, check out the full review and other reviews at aussieboyreviews.",Don't Breathe 2
74,darkreignn,A genuinely disturbing thriller,7,14 August 2021,"Foregoing the iconic turkey baster, ""Don't Breathe 2"" is immediately a less disgusting film than its predecessor - that said, it is by no means any less disturbing. Directed and written by Rodo Sayagues, with a writer's credit also from Fede Alvarez, director of the first ""Don't Breathe,"" this sequel seems to have some competency to it right from the start. The initial opening sequence looks great, and sets the stage for some truly tense filmmaking. Echoing Fede's style, Rodo crafts scenarios that will have you on the edge of your seat - coupled with Stephen Lang's dedicated performance, you've got yourself a sequel that is just as thrilling as the original.Following Stephen Lang as the blind Norman, ""Don't Breathe 2"" introduces a new character: Madelyn Grace as Phoenix. Seemingly Norman's daughter, Phoenix spends her days homeschooled by Norman, as well as being trained in the skills of survival. And as fate would have it, these skills seemingly come in handy as, one night, a group of armed men break into Norman's house with one goal in mind - to kidnap the little girl who lives with him. Enter some white-knuckle filmmaking. Rodo takes pages off of Fede's book and utilizes a free flowing camera during this sequence, along with a sparsity of music, that truly works wonders in sending shivers down your spine. My eyes were glued to the screen during this sequence as the camera followed little Phoenix as she ran, crawled, and fought to stay away from her attackers. Similarly, as Norman put his particular set of skills to work in dispatching the men who have begun hunting him, Rodo handles most of the action uniquely with some expectation-subverting moments that were a joy to watch unfold.By all intents and purposes, you'll think that ""Don't Breathe 2,"" at least on a technical level, is on par with the first. That is, until something happens that starts to make it even better. What makes this movie so interesting and watchable is that, almost constantly, the lines between good and evil are blurred; just when you think someone is doing the right thing, albeit through the wrong way, or when you think that a specific character is a ""good"" guy, Rodo pulls the rug right out from under you. There are truly disturbing, borderline sickening concepts and scenarios introduced in this movie, including a ""twist"" that had me legitimately shocked and appalled, in the best way possible. Rodo put some balls on this movie - he isn't afraid to challenge his audience, which I respected.Truth be told, from a purely entertainment based rating scale, I enjoyed ""Don't Breathe 2"" more than the first. That said, from a script perspective, there is some truly awful dialogue here. There's no easy way to say this so I'll just rip the bandaid off: The writing in this movie isn't great. Yes, the scenarios, sequences, and concepts are very clever and disturbing, but the dialogue glueing them together is as poor as poor can be. Stellar lines such as, ""Enough of these silly games,"" and ""You're a bad man. You've done terrible things. At least, that's what you tell yourself,"" will grace your ears; you may even wish to be blind yourself while watching just so you don't have to see the actors deliver them. However, because of how entertaining the movie is from a horror/thriller point of view, it's easy to overlook the laughable dialogue.Look, when I go to see a thriller I want to be thrilled, and ""Don't Breathe 2"" did, indeed, thrill me. It isn't the best written movie out there, but it's packed with enough suspense and violence to warrant a night out at the movies.",Don't Breathe 2

Fede Alvarez this time serves as the screenwriter rather than directing it.Don't Breathe 2 is almost inarguably less scary, less viscerally sweaty, than its predecessor, where every creak of the floorboards helped build the dark-room tension. But it still manages to maintain the tension, although I don't see whether it really required a sequel.To summarise, I liked Don't Breathe 2, maybe not like it's predecessor, but to an extent where I can say that there still was tense atmosphere built around this sequel.My Rating : 7/10.",Don't Breathe 2

This one feels different and is more like an action movie. Which I think is the right way to go.

This time around, the hunter has become the hunted as the veteran looks to protect his daughter from a gang of ruthless organ traffickers.Director Rodo Sayagues does not let the action abate at any point and continuously pivots the characters' motivation and introduces new elements to their backstories to keep us the viewers, guessing, as to who ultimately is on the right.DOP Pedro Luque elegantly captures the POV of a blind man and uses periods of silence and clever lighting to infuse more tension than even the bone-jarring violence.Stephen Lang is as his brutal best as the wily soldier who uses his blindness to his advantage, with the director adding cleverer DIY weaponry to his already lethal repertoire.Brendan Saxton and Fiana O'Shaughessy shine as chilling antagonist, more so as the director peels away the layers of their characters. Special mention must be made of the precocious Madelyn Grace as he defies her tender age to portray the role of Lang's daughter with seasoned perfection.Don't Breathe 2 doesn't rise to the phenomenal levels of its predecessors, but is good, genuine, violent fun.

82,AdrenalinDragon,Old Man doesn't strike Gold twice,5,13 August 2021,"This was basically what I feared a sequel to Don't Breathe would be. More of the same, but much less well executed. Having the Old Blind Man as the protagonist this time around didn't really work for me. He was a terrible person in the first one and trying to make him sympathetic felt a bit off and lacked the punch. Despite that, Stephen Lang is still the best thing going for this movie by a very significant margin.Not only that, but the tension and action sequences this time around are not as well executed as the original. The thrill of the Old Blind Man working out how to take advantage of the situation is less well utilised here, and for the most part he just attacks people like a standard slasher killer. There's no traps, no interesting tactics, it's just weaker in execution in every way.The addition of a little girl companion is mostly just there for conflict and a bit of variety, otherwise like I said the emotional beats and character connection fell flat for me. The film also felt a bit dumber and more contrived this time around. The Old Man's tactics seemed to play out more sloppily in places this time around, and the bad guys were dumb.

It's dark enough to be a horror movie! But its not all darkness and blood and guts and all that stuff. This movie has serious substance! It is an emotionally moving story and even made me cry a little at the end! The bad guy from the last movie has actually become the good guy and hero of this one!

Assuming you've seen the first one, you know that the blind man did some terrible, arguably unforgivable things. Right off the bat, though, we're essentially forced to forgive him and cheer him on in the face of these new bad guys. How the movie progresses, however, brings to light some new things and it was pretty refreshing in the third act. But don't expect to tie in the first one beyond the blind man, played superbly as ever by Stephen Lang, because there is no other connection. This made the experience more confusing than it should've, but perhaps that's my own fault. In the end this sequel offers less creative cinematography in exchange for more creative violence, a far higher body count, and, yes, more gore. None of it felt gratuitous, though, and ultimately I found myself even applauding some of the predictability in the script. Unlike most, I gave the first a 7 and I'll push this to a 7.5, but they each have their standout merits and flaws.",Don't Breathe 2

However, in contrast to the first film in which the viewer could not support any side, here the script clearly leads the viewer to support the blind veteran who would give his life for this girl. Also, although it has less action and suspense than the first, here it has more emotion and dramatic element. In the end he seems to recognize the mistakes of the past, It is definitely more ethical than the first at least on the side that the screenwriter supports and despite the less action it is more mature as a film than the first.

Yes, you should know about the first part but nothing would lose, if you don't. Then of course, the gore and violence is above average, what you expect from Fede Alvarez. Remember Don't Breathe 1 and Evil dead?What i didn't like is also on the same lines then. In the first part, it was the Blind man's territory, and i totally expect him to take over things easily. But in this, the later part of the movie seemed more heroic than genuine. The Blind man behaved like Daredevil in certain cases.What i also didn't like was the reason of the whole hustle.

I'm not a big fan of horror, but can appreciate quality films in the genre. I was genuinely surprised at how good it was. Despite having a few outlandish and gross moments, it was an incredibly lean, mean, and taut genre filmmaking exercise stuffed to the brim with gripping suspense and originality. It was able to turn the tables on all the genre tropes of the ""home invasion"" movie in very clever ways, and used thoughtful character development to help tell its story. When I heard a sequel was being made, I was cautiously optimistic, although I was a bit concerned after seeing the first trailer that they were trying to make someone as morally repugnant as the Blind Man into some sort of a hero. This sequel isn't terrible by any means, and still has some good sequences of white-knuckle tension. That said, it unfortunately ends up being a largely futile exercise deficient in the substance and originality that the first movie comparatively relished in.This sequel is set after the first movie, and the Blind Man is now raising a young girl named Phoenix. A gang of kidnappers looking for the girl show up at his new, off-the-beaten-path house one night, and suffice it to say all hell breaks loose. I am not at liberty to say what happens after that, or what the motivations of the kidnappers might be. The ""home invasion"" sequence involving the kidnappers lasts for almost a third of the film's runtime. It's pretty suspenseful and gripping, and has great sound design, but it shows nowhere near the level of creative prowess as the home invasion in the first movie. This is because the Blind Man's house in the first film was almost like a character in and of itself; the design of the house was meticulously intertwined with almost every set-up between the him and the robbers. The level of creativity this time around pales in comparison, although viewers just looking for the Blind Man to brutally go berserk will certainly get their fill of that. Stephen Lang does a great job playing the Blind Man, and the child actress playing Phoenix gives a strong performance as well. The plot gradually becomes more incoherent and messy, and lacks the tightness and cohesion of the first film. One of the major flaws of ""Don't Breathe 2"" in comparison with the first installment is its near-total lack of character development. The film makes little effort to develop its characters in creative ways, unlike the first film. In the first film, viewers were aware from very early on the distinct personalities of the three main robbers, and the Blind Man was much better developed. This time around, viewers learn shockingly little more about him than they did in the first film--which, in my book, shows that the screenplay here failed to fully do its job. The film attempts to make some commentary about the ethical paradox of trying to get viewers to (partially) sympathize with the Blind Man despite his brutality and misogyny, but ends up trying to do so in a very muted way that ends up narratively shooting itself in the foot.Despite some brutally effective sequences of tension, this sequel feels like a letdown compared to the first film. If there is a ""Don't Breathe 3,"" they need to bring back Jane Levy's character and make a substantial emphasis on creative character development in the screenplay. 5/10.",Don't Breathe 2

There is no need to inquire whether a sequel was a good idea, for the movie was made. If you are looking for a quick, punch-you-in-the-face suspense horror flick, there are far worse movies to take in these days.Thankfully, there are no large turkey basters to fill or expel this time, but there are a handful of interesting twists on the old theme of being trapped in a house with a blind man filled with rage because he is a bad, bad man, probably because of something he did or saw when serving our country as a Navy Seal. We even get to hang out in an abandoned swimming pool, a location assuredly rife with peril, no matter whether you have a disability or not.Who is the villain? Are we all anti-heroes these days? Is it wrong to root for bad people when their hearts are struggling to find the right light with which to wander through the challenges of a world bent on its own destruction? Or is there no hope for our youngest generation, and we must accept the duty of preparing them all for the worst?",Don't Breathe 2

If you blink, or are 60 seconds late into the movie theatre, you'll miss it. There's no real backstory, or build-up to anything...it just happens! Whereas, in part one, we get an idea of the personalities, traits and motivations of all the main characters...we almost 'follow them around' for a while, to get a feel for them, before things start to go down. I'm not even sure I even know any of the character's names.Very far-fetched and 'convenient' throughout. It's just a really bad rehash of part 1. Must be a different director, because this had none of the charms of the prequel. Almost zero tension. Unexplained motivation...and unnecessarily gory.The 'don't breathe' element that made the first film so good, is totally absent.

109,matrixdukenukem,Need & hubris,8,4 October 2021,"After success of 1st one I was wondering why they didn't make a sequel? Because that's why Hollywood does - milk every success as much as possible. And I was ready for this dairy product. But 7 years is too much of a wait and by this time we've already seen a better made blind super hero - Daredevil. So the novelty of it was gone.But I was genuinely surprised. First of all, this sequel only does one thing - ups the ante. The blind guy is still morally compromised like in first one. The bad guys are bad guys with a reasonable agenda and like the first one there's a girl who is caught up at centre of it all. This time the bad guys know how to fight. Thus, twice the thrills and better action.Like John McCain, the blind guy gets bloodied and beat up to pulp and you wonder how is he going to make it and that makes it more fun. First half specially is very edge of the seat fast paced. Second half dips and is where the movie could've used better and stronger writing. Stephen is great as the blind guy and the kid Phoenix is alright. Dogs have done great job so have the bad guys.It's not as bad as people are saying nor its as well sorted as first one. This is more action than horror unlike first one but the action is very well done. I do hope for the third they bring back the horror factor back.It's a 7/10 from me. +1 to make up for unwarranted bad reviews.",Don't Breathe 2

The first one has its significance in this one too, without giving too much into the movie I would just say go to the theaters since they've opened and watch this movie on the giant screen.

114,Benslie,Just doesn't have the same charm as the first,4,15 August 2021,"I honestly have no clue where to even begin with this movie but I'll start with talking about the story and pacing. The story and pacing just didn't match up at all and just didn't mesh properly. This movie is split up between two acts and I didn't care very much for either because despite this movie being ten minutes longer than the first one it felt like it was thirty minutes long...in total. That's how fast this movie goes and it just doesn't give enough time to get in-depth with anything in this movie. Everything had to be bullet-pointed and just shoved in wherever it could be. This movie easily had the potential to be good and you can see with the first half what they were trying to do and then the second half happened. The best way to describe it is they had one writer for the first part and then changed writers for the last bit. If you've seen the trailer, you know that they have the old blind man exit his house and honestly that's where the movie fails. The first movie has great tension with it just being in his house that you got that sense of claustrophobia but here not so much. The acting in this movie also really wasn't that great and I couldn't really connect to any of the characters. In the end, Don't Breathe 2 could've been at least a passable movie but it just flops.

The cinematography is phenomenal just like the first one and the sound design is also great, the way they made this film is great to be honest. The special effects on the gore is crazy good and I couldn't believe just how gory this film was compared to the first one. Stephen Lang as the main character is great again, he plays this role very well. The main problem for me is that they made the blind guys character way too likeable and after the first film I didn't want to like this character but there isn't anyone else to root for other than him and that just gives me mixed signals on what I'm feeling towards this film. Overall though, a decent watch and a happy addition to the horror franchise. Give it a watch!",Don't Breathe 2

I actually liked it better than the first, only because the first film was honestly boring and didn't really have that much of a story, this one has a pretty decent story, and pretty decent action.

124,Luv2Spooge,Pretty good for a night of horror and action,7,19 September 2021,"In terms of actions and horror, it has a lot more than the 1st one. But there it lies the problem as most of it seemed rather forced or unrealistic. The first film was meticulous when it comes to details and so the plot was very realistic and thought out. This one seemed more gearing towards simply a action/horror flick and was more of a cliche. However, again, if you don't take it too seriously, it will give you an entertaining night. I'd compare this to the 1st one like the difference between Rambo 1 and 2.Actions aside, the story element itself is also quite unbelievable at parts. For example, and not giving spoilers, the protagonist moving about his own home like a professional is believable. It is his own environment, he's familiar with it. But when he showed the same kind of awareness in a foreign place, that just comes off really unbelievable.However, that aside, I still praise the creativity and the story writing. When the plot device is revealed about a little more than 1/2 way through, it sends a chill down my spine what these villains were really planning from the start. It was absolutely downright horrifying, which makes you realize this is not simply an action film, but is actually in the horror category.",Don't Breathe 2
125,PerryAtTheMovies,"Enjoyable, but not worth of a theatre viewing....",6,14 August 2021,"(My Ratings)
Overall: 67.5/100
IMDb: 6/10
Letterboxd: 3/5Overall, if you enjoyed the first film I think you may also enjoy the second film. However, you don't need to see the first to understand the second. Emotionally, the movie was ok. Choreography was exciting for the fight scenes. The timing was a little lopsided where the film took too long to get to the point. Acting not great, but not terrible. Stephen Lang's performance is pretty much focal. I'd say wait for this film to hit a streaming service, or go on a cheap night if you really want to see it in theatres.This sequel isn't a carryover from the first film, but rather a story on its own. I enjoyed the story in this film and the direction it took. However, it does take a long time for it to become engaging and interesting. Although it does take some time to get to the point. The build-up for the action and reveal is near perfect because again, a bit too long to get there.The acting isn't award worthy, but it is good enough to convey some emotions and tension. Once again I found Stephen Lang delivering a convincing blind soldier fighting for what's his. This time around there's a slight bit more use of other senses which brought a slight bit more realism to a blind character.Kind of tied into the acting, but ever so slightly separate from it is the choreography for fighting and sneaking. I really enjoyed how fluid the camera work was as enemy goes into an area and friendly uses the environment to get out of the way, or using the elements around to conjure up a surprise attack. That in my opinion was well done and made me enjoy the movie more.The negatives that I found were, rehashing above, timing. It felt too long to get to the point. Even for such a short film at an hour and thirty-eight minutes. I managed to find a way for the beginning of the movie to seem boring. Emotionally the film didn't strike a chord in me. I didn't angry, sad, or scared. I just kind of sat there allowing the movie to play in front of me.Again, Happy Friday the 13th, and as always, enjoy the show....",Don't Breathe 2
126,jcooloti,Not nearly as good as the first.,6,12 September 2021,"I gave the first film 10/10. I loved it... so, so much...This is sloppy 2nds.No longer is our protagonist a flawed hero (so well done in the 1st with the lead female character of the first film), but they have turned the blind man now into our flawed hero... and not very well in my opinion because unlike most people (the writers included), I seem to remember this blind man being a sociopathic, murdering, rapist of sorts... as well as a kidnapper of women (that didn't really deserve to be chained up in a basement and impregnated with a turkey baster).It's hard not to go into what I actually think is wrong with the writing behind Don't Breath 2 without spoiling the twist and turns... which I admit had me wondering up to the film's climax. The only problem is... well, it's just lame and unbelievable. I don't know how else to say it. Now I'm not saying the first was super believable... You definitely had to suspend some disbelief for that movie, but this one is a different kind of unbelievable. The reason the bad guys are closing in is stupid and silly. The first film had me from the beginning, I believed that girl wanted to escape to California with her sister... I believed that cowardly boyfriend was a petty criminal and I believed that kid was immature and taking advantage of his father's security business. I even believed the old blind man's story and his uncanny ability to be the death dealing master of his own house, having lived as a blinded navy seal in isolation on a deserted block in Detroit. However, everything about Don't Breath 2 is unbelievable.The first suspenseful sequence in the house has got NOTHING on the first sequence in the first film involving that fantastic oner (single shot). I'm really supposed to believe this child is some kind of acrobatic ninja?! She sure seemed to lose all those skills later on in the movie...So I wasn't completely disappointed though. It's an alright action film. The horror element has been completely removed... I can live with that but I wouldn't have done it. That's what makes the first one so awesome! But hey, I like action movies. Whatever... the dialogue though! Yikes! ""Bro, he's a navy seal""...""A dead seal, bro."" If they were trying to be funny with those lines they succeeded, but I'm not so sure if they were. And the last scene with the little girl... I hadn't cringed that badly since the last scene in Rise of the Skywalker. It was this last scene that brought my rating down from a 7 to a 6, just barely making this film above average.Was it a disappointment? Well, I wasn't expecting an Empire Strikes Back level sequel here, but it was a little more disappointing than I was expecting. Still with another viewing, maybe I'll appreciate it a little more. Maybe.The first film was amazing on all levels. This is not even close. Having a different director for the sequel (even if he helped make the first one) really brought it down a couple of notches.And that's it. That's all I'm gonna say. See it.

Wouldn't want to miss it and I'm glad I decided to give it a shot after disliking first part.Directed very well, dialogue is decent for this kind of film, story makes a lot of sense and plot twist was somewhat unexpected. A lot of very nice kills. A huge slasher fan in me is satisfied.Don't want to spoil anything; all the scenes with the dog were adorable!

142,paulmcuomo,"An interior sequel, for a problematic premise.",6,14 August 2021,"In 2016, I saw Don't Breathe in cinemas twice - once out of curiosity and then again out of interest in the technical details. I even reviewed it here - I did enjoy it, despite the fact you do need to turn off your logic part of the brain and simply absorb what's on screen for what it is. He had a strong central pair of characters in Jane Levy's Rocky and Dylan Minnette that both brought their own unique perspective to situations and were very well-rounded, it had an ominous and interesting antagonist in ""The Blind Man"" played by Stephen Lang, and the movie was directed in a very tight manner with a lot of creative set pieces and camerawork. Like I said, turn off logic and the movie is a great sit.This sequel carries over that excellent camerawork and set pieces, with very recognisable locations that service the geography of the house well. That's the only real part that does carry over fully from the first film; there are traces of the strong acting, threatening antagonists and an enjoyably silly plot, but it's not all there. The first part is that whilst it is stupid to say you hate this movie based on the fact you're being asked to root for the monstrous Blind Man from the first film in this one, it is fair to say it is a massive obstacle that the movie has to overcome and it can't quite manage that as he isn't a strong enough character to build an entire film/story around.So in this film, the Blind Man has rebuilt the family he lost before the events of the first film, and he has a daughter now symbolically named ""Phoenix"", played by Madelyn Grace who does a good job for a child actor being asked to do a massive amount of difficult scenes. One day, she runs into a gang leader called Raylan, played by Brandan Sexton III, who takes a bizarre interest in her. When the men break into his house to look for her, events similar in a way to the first film unfold, but with just as many twists thrown in.Speaking of the quality of the scares, one thing that surprised me a lot in this film was the amount of gore, considering the first film was noticeably absent of it - by design. This film takes more of an exploitation movie approach, with is odd because it leads to characters doing very out of character things especially in the climax where a character ensues an easy kill for a piece of cheap violence and then it comes back to hurt them. The villains are intimidating and powerful, but they're nowhere near the overawing presence of the Blind Man from the first film, who in a role where he's been elevated to protagonist, essentially just feels like his role from the first film just with the perspective switched, and the moderately sympathetic robbers have been replaced with people who are more unsavoury.The acting is fine; Lang is good in a film that is demanding a lot of him - just like the last film he doesn't have many lines to work with, and it must be very exhausting to act blind and still be realistic with it. Grace does well. Sexton is alright but he does feel mildly out of place, especially when the truth about him is revealed. He also has several smaller cronies with him that are very thinly drawn - it's kind of the cost of the movie having multiple villains is that they can't be drawn the same way as having one big one. The fact that, also, no one in this film has the names like Jane Levy or Dylan Minette makes it hard to remember people beyond hairstyles.Overall, it is a good movie that does seem to draw a line under the series. However, in my personal opinion, they didn't seem to be a point in this film being made - the first one is fairly final despite the arguably open ending, and whilst this has a closed ending there may be a place it can go. We'll wait and see.",Don't Breathe 2
143,TruView,This is now the land of wolves,9,10 September 2021,"This much anticipated sequel to the smash hit picks up about eight years after. We see that the blind veteran and his attack dog, midnight, find themselves in somewhat happier times. Life has returned to their sleepy section of the neighborhood with the addition of a spirited preteen - now in their charge. Keeping her well protected and training her on how not to be a passive victim is of the utmost concern. That need to serve and protect is still very much apart of his persona even after so much violence and misfortune.The retribution meted out by the old veteran toward the armed assailants in their foiled home invasion plot in the previous film might've been considered heavy-handed vigilantism bordering on lunacy but he was certainly NOT the good guy. In this film however, it is made very clear who the bad guys are. They practically have no moral compass to speak of. And while that of our protagonist is broken -it at least still exists. Here he IS the good guy but ONLY by default. On the whole, this movie intimates a long goodbye to the days of plenty, forecasting that in America you will now have to claw, scratch, fight, and apparently steal for every piece of meat. And that friends and family are those who can serve a purpose. It's becoming all so very cutthroat.This suspense thriller has all the right components, in just the right measure, arranged in the right combinations. Its very difficult for a second film to do as good as the first, but then to exceed it is quite another, indeed. This one manages to do just that. Bravo!",Don't Breathe 2
144,bbevis-47954,Lacks Thrills of the Original,2,28 September 2021,"I found myself incredibly bored during Don't Breathe 2, and this is coming from someone who like a good B movie any chance I get.First the acting is bad across the board. None of the drama works and the main bad guy is horribly miscast.Secondly there is barely any thrills. I will give the film some credit for a decent steady cam sequence as the little girl dodges the burglars in the beginning of the film. Everything in this film is predictable, even the twist halfway through the movie if you want to call it that. There is one good kill against one of the burglars about 30-40 minutes in.Lastly, the story. The motivations for characters is out of this world and you have to have a massive suspension of disbelief to believe anything that happens in this movie. The choice to have sympathy for the Blind Man was a terrible decision. Anyone who gives this high reviews remember what he did in the first movie? I don't care about his past or future self. The guy is a psychopath and I couldn't morally root for him.I was bored, didn't care to watch the last twenty minutes and completely regretted waisting money watching this cash-grab-dumpster-fire of a triller.",Don't Breathe 2

There are some gruesome killings as the blind man fights for his life. The film does an impressive job of saturating us in suspense and action. Although the film addresses the early confusion, it takes a dramatic turn as the plot thickens. The vision of the plot becomes clear, but doesnt seem to flow as effortlessly as the first film. Lastly, the film does an excellent job in challenging you to pick a side; especially if you watched the first.Therefore, Don't Breathe 2 is a satisfactory sequel, the plot is different yet still applies the same effective structure as the first.

This film is not exactly what you would say is a horror movie and more of a thriller with just a few jump-scares sprinkled in. The main area in which this movie shines in is certainty atmosphere, most of the movie being set in a empty suburban purgatory filled with dilapidated buildings with their designs suffocated by graffiti. The lighting of the film uses coloring to it's advantage to express the moods of the different scenes. The actors in the movie do a good job of carrying the world of film and create complex characters that will have you changing sides the further we explore what's behind their masks. The story has twists that are intriguing and create great mystery and will have you on the edge of your seat wondering what's next. However, the story feels random when compared to the first movie. The protagonist being blind does not feel necessary in this action revenge story and extra time is wasted on watching the blind man being blind. The fact the movie follows the old man from Don't Breathe serves no point in terms of storytelling and feels like a corporate trick to get you to watch an original movie, which is probably what happened. It also doesn't make much sense a remorseless killer would become the hero/anti-hero of the story in the sequel with no transition. Nonetheless, the film is solid, and while it may not top the suspenseful original, it is certainly an enjoyable film that packs a gory action revenge story into a small runtime that gets straight to the point faster than most movies.",Don't Breathe 2

Camera's whip around hallways and travel along staircases in beautiful tracking shots and perfect CGI integration. These shots, as wonderfully done in the first film, establish our location and set the movie up for the thrill ride we are about to embark on... unfortunately, this time, the location only lasts half of the film and we journey to a new unspecified, unestablished and dimly lit location in the most unrealistic way possible. This half drags the film down, but it never becomes unbearable or bad. Just a tad silly and seemingly rushed. Stephen Lang is back and is once again an amazing ...bad guy? The fun thing about the first film was how he seemed like a sympathetic character and then slowly became unhinged. Here, they try hard to give his choices weight and give his character the much needed relection he needs. It's a smart bold move on the choice of the filmmakers and it works in the final scenes. After all, the entire premise hinges on his character being rooted for. And we kind of do as he takes down his newest threat in new and gruesome ways. These scenes are full of tension and are a hell of a lot of fun to watch. That's why It's just a shame that this movie feels a tad rushed and half baked.",Don't Breathe 2

A little girl has been orphaned and now lives with this blind ex-marine. He is cool but this little girl rubbed a man wrong in the bathroom. He felt soooo insulted he followed her to her house with thugs and then tried killing her. But no matter because the marine is so nice he kills everyone. Easier said than done.The men attempt to kidnap her reguardless and succeed. Wanna hear a dumb plot twist? This jerkwad of a main villain happens to be the father! Oh yes very fatherly of this Marky Mark look a-like is the evil bad guy.So here comes the worst part. Her mom is alive to but dying so she needs her to be an organ donar.Anyway, they all die a horrible death except for the little girl who had it cut out for her now she lives in an orphanage. Maybe she'll be come an old blind kung-fu lady when she grows up in the 2028 sequel. Don't Breath 3: GI-GrannyDon't Breath is a story I'd much rather hear and read about because it's too brutal.

Well, here he is with a daughter Phoenix (Madelyn Grace) in this sequel.The film picks up 8 years (Yes, 8 years) after the events of the first one, which the writers seem to have forgotten. The blind man is still the same, except he raised a daughter after she lost her family in a fire.This is when a group of villains so forgettable that I forgot their names already invade his house. After a cat-and-mouse game we know that one of them is Phoenix's father who wants her back. Blind man of course doesn't want that, and protects her at all cost.Don't Breathe 2 is a violent film. Very much earning it's R-rating. During all the gruesome violence however, I often doubted if some scenes were necessary. The skillful direction from Rodo Sayagues is already good enough. The tension, the suspense, is all there. This film shouldn't be a film relying on bloody violence.Stephen Lang and Madelyn Grace were very good in the movie. Fortunately Phoenix doesn't become annoying. Meanwhile when we root for the blind man and enjoy his badass-ness, he is not a hero.

Another reviewer already mentioned the ""You're a bad man"" line. That will have you rolling your eyes, and as the story goes on, things become more and more ridiculous.The villain's motivation in particular is beyond stupid, and the scenes with the doctor will have your brain finally checking out.In retrospect, the only things I enjoyed about the movie were the camera work (the long single take shot during the initial home invasion stands out, I still don't know how they actually did that), the acting and some of the gore scenes.There's a lot of talent here wasted on an awful script.",Don't Breathe 2

I just wish they didn't give him so many speaking lines. I believe that The Blind Man's silence and swiftness were what made his character so menacing.The cinematography fell beyond short of what I expected based on this film's antecedent, and the editing was painfully turbulent. This bogged down the gruesome action violence and ruined the film's potential to be taken seriously as an action thriller sequel... and I use the word ""sequel"" very lightly here.I honestly feel that this movie was just a petty cash grab, and that not including Jane Levy in this film or a follow-up on her character, Rocky (if she'd been recast), was a deplorably missed opportunity.

181,kooldddon,Enjoyable but lacks when compared to the previous one,7,10 September 2021,"A decent sequel to the 1st one with the protagonist being the only character coming back with a fresh story which is not directly related to the 1st one. As I expected from the trailer this one is a taut and well made thriller with the key setup being similar to the 1st film. The film is enjoyable throughout although it does goes down in some places along the story. Cinematography is very cool and gives great angles to the viewers. The story, screenplay and writing are good. Editing is crisp and the music lends solidarity to the overall setting of the film. I'm not sure this sequel was necessary because frankly both films don't connect apart from just the character of the protagonist. But I could see this as a redemption arc for the protagonist's character briefly. All in a this is a good film and you will enjoy watching this one. The 1st film was miles better though.",Don't Breathe 2
182,ReaLMoisan,Issues with this Film.,4,22 September 2021,"A list of nitpicks, plot contrivances, and plot holes in order of appearance, not severity. Many of these issues are technical or logistical nitpicks and contrivances, but they all add up to break immersion from the watching experience. Maybe you didn't notice, or maybe you don't care about such issues, but some people do. It destroys immersion and enjoyment when you're thinking WTF every five minutes in a film. Every movie benefits from limiting or removing such issues.-The timing and positioning of Phoenix jumping over the upstairs rail is suspect. Judging by the time, distance, and positioning of Jim-Bob on the stairs, and when he walks into frame after the light switch is thrown. Jim-Bob should have already been up the stairs and facing Phoenix and the light switch when she leapt over the rail.-How does Phoenix get into the spandrel (cubby under the stairs) silently? When Jim-Bob opens the doors the hinges are really loud. She didn't have time to quietly open and close those doors even if they could be manipulated silently.-How do the home invaders shoot the dog, Shadow silently? No members of the home invasion crew have suppressors on their guns. Guns are loud, really loud.-How does the Blind Man have the time or ability to glue the lips of Jared shut? Jared wasn't choked out, and there wasn't time to be chocked out and regain consciousness before Jim-Bob shows up seconds later. How do you subdue and healthy man half your age with one hand while being injured, and use a tube a glue with your other hand? Also, the Blind Man didn't have the glue tube in one of his hands when he attacked Jared, so he would have had to subdue Jared while picking up the tube too. How does the glue set in time without Jared breaking the glue seal? The blind man had seconds to jump out the window from the time of the gunshot to Jim-Bob opening the garage door. Jim-Bob was beside the greenhouse, near the back deck which is meters (yards) from the garage when the gunshot went off.-Despite what movie tropes would have you believe, Pheonix would actually be fine if Duke put the exposed wire in the water. That metal box on concrete in a basement is grounded, and tap water is a poor to only an okay conductor of electricity. The second the wire touched the water the breaker would trip, and she would be fine. She would maybe suffer a minor jolt before the breaker tripped.-A small propane tank expelling propane in a basement that large wouldn't be an issue for combustion unless the firearm was fired very close to the propane tank. Duke is far enough from the tank that this would never be an issue. The air would need over 2% to almost 10% propane to risk combustion. The 2.4 gallons of volumetric propane in that tank would do nothing in a room that large. A 3m x 3m x 2.5m (10'x10'x8') room has almost 6,000 gallons of volume for reference.-Most of the propane would have harmlessly dissipated before the tank exploded. Even if the propane ignited, the tank would just spew flame, they rarely explode unless unique conditions are met. Plus, how much propane could possibly be left in that tank? If that tank released into a 1m x 1m x 1m (3'x3'x3') room it wouldn't release enough propane to make the air combustible at 1.2% concentration of propane. Since 2.15% is the absolute minimum required for combustion.-That red cabinet full of water is around 140cm x 60cm x 90cm (4.5'x2'x3') in size. Which is around 760kg (over 1,600lbs) of mass. That's a conservative estimate of the cabinets volume and mass filled with water without including the cabinets own weight. A more realistic volume looks closer to 1,100kg (almost 2,500lbs) of mass. The Blind Man looks fit, but that's an accomplishment. Could he tip it over, impossible considering his hand and shoulder placement, and foot purchase. He would need leverage (feet pushing off the wall), and pushing from the top, not crouching and pushing near the middle and bottom like he is. Could he push it hard enough to make it slide on concrete, never. A 100kg (220lbs) man can generate around 1000 newtons of pushing force, which equates to 102 kilogram force. Disregarding wheels, pulleys, levers, gradient and friction (of surfaces) the general rules is, without acceleration you can only push as much as you weigh. This is why sumo wrestlers usually have significant body masses.-In a life and death situation, you'd shoot the pitbull. The dog isn't the only danger in this situation. The dog barking is giving away his location to armed men who want to kill him. The attic hatch is the ideal choke point to shot someone trying to descend the ladder too. Good thing the home invaders decide to leave the house and sit inside their truck. They prefer to not confirm their kills, and just throw Molotov cocktails into the house and leave. The movie tries to convince you they don't think it's worth the risk or effort, but they know exactly where he is, thanks to the dog barking. The entire plot requires the Blind Man to not shoot the dog.-The Blind Man can hear bells jingling inside a van from a significant distance. How are the bells moving, the windows are rolled up so it's not the wind. Unless the wind is forceful enough to move the entire van, in which case, wind is loud, especially with so many trees with leaves around. Also, why don't the bells make noise when he opens the door and leans into the van, and when he stands there with the door open? A little consistency goes a long way.-They are wrong about needing to keep Phoenix alive for the heart transplant. Thoracic organs are viable for transplant outside the body 4-6 hours after death. The only requirement for transport is keeping the organ at 4 degrees celsius (39 degrees fahrenheit), and submersion in one of multiple readily available heart preservation solutions (HPSs). So a bar fridge and a container of solution would suffice. Which he would require anyway, since the surgeon still has to prepare the mother for the transplant after removing Phoenix's heart.-Also, there's no way a surgeon would saw into Phoenix's chest without sedating, or at least restraining her. Cutting open a rib cage is a precise procedure, and I suspect a conscious and unrestrained patient would move around just a bit. Are they even trying to suspend disbelief at this point?-Three cans of insect repellent make better smoke grenades than actual smoke grenades. Smoke grenades designed for smoke volume, generate around 1,100m cubed (40,000') of smoke per minute, for about three minutes That room with the pool is roughly 6,300m cubed (220,000') and filled with gas in seconds. Guess he got lucky on the repellent brand.-6,300m cubed (220,000') room, and Raylan shoots the Mother centre mass. That's unlucky.""My name is Pheonix"" is way better than the ""my name is Rey Skywalker"" from Rise of Skywalker. So that's something.",Don't Breathe 2

Then the main bad guy was going to shoot the blind guy but the girl pushed his gun away. Then he tells his men to kill the blind guy but not in front of the girl? WTF? There was water spraying right beside the blind guy, but he still could hear exactly where a bad guy was running? You can't do open heart transplant in a old building. I don't even have to explain this. You can't get another person who can make the drugs? Instead of finding someone you rather go through this to get the daughter and do a heart transplant that would 100% fail. I don't need to explain this. Then the main bad guy shoots randomly when he knows his wife is right in front of him? Then the wheelchair started to move, but the girl is too stupid to stand up and use the control to stop it? Or evne pull the mom off? They weren't attached to the wheel chair. Then the main bad guy is blind but someone finds the other blind guy and stabs him? I guess when you are newly blind, you have super powers too. Not only he walked to the blind man, he stabbed him knowing exactly where his body was?

Not so much this turn, infact, the more unique the kills the more insipid it seems, no matter what kind of Vet this guy is, no one is that good.

I was able to believe that a somewhat elderly blind war veteran could take on three stupid teenagers trying to rob his house. What I can't believe is that he could take on five men with guns and various other weapons. This guy has more lives than Michael Myers.There's a young girl in the film which intrigued me at first. Who is she and how did she come to live with the old man? This could have played out in a plausible and interesting way, Instead her subplot becomes so over the top that the audience at my screening started laughing.This is a world where numerous gun shots, explosions, and fires happen but no one apparently hears them and calls the police. This is a world where a crack house looks bizarrely like a dilapidated haunted mansion. This is a world where a child can be put through absolute hell and apparently not be traumatized. Don't

And it did not disappoint for the most part.It is a huge risk to change the villain into a hero for the sequel and I could not help to think about Logan in this movie. But eventhough it is a completely story and movie, it stayed loyal to some elements of the first movie. Especially the glass roof scene was nice. And story wise there is not much to complain about, it is good not more not less.The main issue is the writing. There is almost no dialogue, especially during the invasion. And when the dialogue happened, it was forced and did distract me a lot. I still think if it was better not to use dialogue at all as the shots did say everything you needed.

Surely when you talk about being ""compatible"" you could find a donor and it didn't HAVE to be the daughter to begin with2) So the whole plot was getting the child's heart but the bad guy tries to electrocute her?3) While the girl is in the chamber/locker contraption and it is full of water, THAT is the moment she tries to open a latch at the bottom. Wouldn't it be obvious to go for it as soon as the water started filling up?4) Silenced weapons?5) The first movie included phones which means that this is more into the future which has phones. When the bad guys break in, call 911?6) No fire alarm in the house? Isn't that against the law?7) No neighbors to call the cops or the fire brigade when the house is being broken into/burned down?8) Kidnapping the girl in the first instance would have made more sense. Chloroform her and take her to the house where they're performing the heart transplant?9) Why wait for her to wake up and tell her you're her parents etc? Just perform the operation while she's under?10) The bad father gets poked in the eyes and is up and running a few moments later. First experience of being blinded and you're able to sneak up on the old guy easily?11) Insect killers are spraying everywhere causing temporary fog and blindness. Wouldn't people started coughing their lungs out with that much spray?12) The only reason the bad guys are trying to save the mother is because she's the one who cooks the meth. Why couldn't she teach the others or could they not get any other meth cooks onboard?13) The bad guy who grows a conscience could have helped the old blind guy dealing with the others.

Coming in at just 98 minutes of almost pure action you can't help but enjoy this late summer popcorn flick. I would call it the Daredevil film we deserved but never got. Stephen Lang was superb and I enjoyed the various ways in which he dispatched the antagonists. Madelyn Grace was serviceable but nothing special just like the main antagonist and his henchmen.

The first one is way better than this.I don't understand some scenes, he gets his eyes pushed to the back, and he doesn't wake up in no type of pain, seriously? Just acted like nothing happened. Another part was, that's his daughter and he is caressing her face/hair like that and stalking her in a bathroom. It definitely does not give me father vibes. I'm just not a fan of animal killing, & the little girl didn't save the other dog. However, I'm giving it a 6 because I like Stephen Lang and he plays that part very well!

235,max-siqueira-1189,The Rapist is now a hero??????,1,31 October 2021,"I saw what the writers tried to do here. Turn the old blind rapist man from the first movie into a hero. A way to try to erase and justify their actions but it didn't work with me. Avarage/bad film that misses the main aspect of those who watched the first one: it completely ignores the ""Hook"" that the previous one left. This detail alone makes the movie lose a bit of its essence and logic, but if you completely ignore the ending of the previous movie and pretend it never happened then you can enjoy this one that is basically a copy of the first one.They could have taken the hook from the previous movie and actually made a sequel, but they preferred to go the more comfortable path and opted for the cliché (which I didn't like very much).Another detail that bothers me in this movie is trying to make the old blind man and rapist be the ""good guy"" of the plot. I just can't at any point in the movie sympathize with himself they force this ""hero"" plot. I spent the whole movie rooting for Phoenix so she could kill everyone: her parents and the old man.Sorry screenwriters but the fact that he went to war doesn't make him a god fighter: he's blind and has limitations, he's not Daredevi. Several scenes involving the blind guy run away from reality, as he picks things up in places First-rate randoms without groping like the electrical wire. Running away from a fire ??????It's a good movie if you're willing to root for the rapist/kidnapper and I wasn't. It's the kind of movie that was better left alone in the first one.",Don't Breathe 2

It felt very rushed and everything wrapped up too quick. Stephen Lang was really awesome as the blind man. He was very menacing and unpredictable. I think the first one was a little bit better but it was overall pretty enjoyable. It was very thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat and I didn't know what would happen next. It had a couple twists that I really didn't see coming. I really like all the gore and it had some pretty awesome kills. I enjoyed it but I felt like the ending was rushed and it just ended way too quick. I give Don't Breathe 2 a 5.5 / 10.,Don't Breathe 2

Its a film that definitely didn't need to be made, but compared to other sequels nobody asked for, it wasn't terrible & at least was intriguing to watch.The film takes place 8 years after the events of the first film. The Blind Man is taking care of a little girl who lives in his home. It's not clear if this girl is his daughter (did the turkey baster plan finally work?), or if he kidnapped this girl & raised her as his own. Soon enough, we see that the girl is being stalked by a group of men. They break into the house trying to find her, and a series of gruesome events unfold. We then find out the secret of why these men are after this girl. Long story short, these are all bad guys. The only good person in the film is the little girl.The movie is entertaining enough for a sequel we didn't need, although it's kinda tough to empathize with a guy who tried to turkey baste the girl from the previous film. They humanized him a little too much for my liking but other than that, it's an okay film. There are worse ways to spend an hour and a half.",Don't Breathe 2

Besides, Don't Breathe 1 was a much more suspenseful thriller than this was. However, as a stand alone film, Don't Breathe 2 was pretty good. It had some suspense and a twist or two. I think it would be flogging a dead horse to do a Number 3, though. The little girl coming back to take over where her ""father"" left off. No thanks. Nil interest.Speaking of the little girl, Madelyn Grace did a superb job. A better actress than a lot of adult actresses that get hired for horror films due to their looks and not their acting prowess.So, as my title says...don't compare this film to its predecessor and you will enjoy it much more.",Don't Breathe 2

I definitely recommend this movie if you like suspenseful, slightly disturbing thrillers.",Don't Breathe 2
250,brionesb,"Surprisingly good sequel, that I wasn't expecting...",7,14 August 2021,"Seeing the trailers for this movie for the first time, my first thought was ""why would they make this? What is there left to do that would make this thrilling?"". Given my surprise at seeing the trailer, my first reaction really was that the studio was beating a dead horse & really reaching for a story that reached its natural conclusion in the first and only entry. Thankfully, I am happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised & entertained by this movie when the end credits rolled.The reason that I say that this sequel didn't really have any new stories or ideas to present is because the first movie highly relied upon the novelty of a blind man turning the tables on a group of home invaders. All of what made the original movie such a treat was that we didn't expect the blind guy to be a twisted bad ass. If the studio and filmmakers gave us a slight variation of that same story again for a second time, I guarantee that it would fail miserably because the novelty of the situation and the twists involved would be re-treading the same exact familiar ground. Instead, I'm glad that the blind man was put in the position of the home invading thieves of the first film and was basically the protagonist of this film along with the very young & talented Madelyn Grace as his daughter.The movie opens shortly after the events of the first film, although this time we see a younger version of Madelyn Grace's character Phoenix laying face down in the middle of the street. We then flash forward several years and we see Phoenix on the run in the wilderness, being chased by someone & the dog from the first film. She finally comes up on an open car with a gun laying out on the seat and grabs it, only to be grabbed from behind by the blind man.... But he has no intentions of hurting her nor does his dog, because he is actually Phoenix's guardian and is attempting to teach her survival techniques.We then see Phoenix and the blind man at home, with her cutting his hair and asking about her past. Phoenix is told that she was found laying in the street & passed out in front of a house that was burning down. He took her in under his wing and cared for her since then and has basically adopted Phoenix as his daughter. Of course the young girl is hungry & curious for more details about her unknown past and also yearns to be released from the lonely confines of the house they both live in and wants to be around other kids her own age. Later in the day, a friend of the blind man stops by to pick up some plants that he is selling and has a conversation with him about how Phoenix is doing and finds out that she has been asking to go into town. The friend convinces the blind man to let Phoenix come into town and so he lets her accompany the friend and she winds up meeting and briefly having fun with a few other kids at a park. Just before she heads back home, she encounters a strange man while using the restroom & from there the meat and potatoes of the story begins...It turns out that the man in the restroom wants Phoenix for some reason & tails her back to the home. Without spoiling things or giving away more, the story turns into a story about the blind man's efforts to protect Phoenix from being kidnapped by the group of men who followed her home.If you've watched the first movie, you will be surprised to see that the blind man is now in the role of the protagonist and thus the ""hero"" of our story. It is a bit of an interesting twist to have him play this role in the story rather than being the antagonist because it does wind up setting up some thrilling situations and set pieces which don't disappoint. If you've seen the original Don't Breathe, it won't come as any surprise that the blind man can outwit the numerous guys out to get him but it is fun and entertaining to see how it all unfolds. Because the blind man and Phoenix are put into the position of being the victims, we do see a relatively fresh spin on things from the first movie where the blind man was the one doing all the stalking.At first glance, the story does seem a bit hokey and contradictory to the first movie but mostly because it takes a bit of a left turn in making the blind man the sympathetic character this time around. If you just discard the fact that the blind man was the villain in the first film, everything else as a whole with the story and events of this film mostly works and is solid. Again, I don't think this movie would've been half as entertaining or fun if it just re-did & re-enacted the same story beats and sequences from the original film. It would fall very strongly into the been there done that category and not very well.With all of that said, is this a great sequel? No, but it does the job just fine in providing more of the same thrills as the original movie without feeling like it is an exact carbon copy with everything amped up as is par for a sequel. If you enjoyed the tense cat-and-mouse games that were being played in the first movie, you will equally enjoy this movie as they find inventive ways to play the same game again with the roles reversed. Do I recommend watching this in the theater? Yes, it comes as a strong recommendation if you enjoyed the original. In my opinion, this is one of the more solidly produced movies put out this summer and something that won't disappoint if you want a decent fun & thrilling night(or day) out at the movies!",Don't Breathe 2

There's a lack of tension because the ""old man"" looks to be immortal and everytime he's in danger, we know he's going to survive.I can divide it in two parts: even being enjoyable, the first half is quite predictable, but the second half is a thrilling and unexpected trip.I mean, this sequel isn't bad but also hasn't the ingredients that made Don't Breathe (2016) a surprisingly and intense film.",Don't Breathe 2
257,socialsunshine-12645,"Please, let this be the last one",3,23 September 2021,"What's interesting about this franchise is that in each addition the writers manage to do a poor job at making characters multidimensional/flawed, but human. In each movie they pit the old man protagonist against a group of random people and I guess the viewers are meant to see both sides of the story, but I never do. With the exception of the children and animals, everyone in these films are objectively terrible. Because of this I dont find myself rooting or sympathizing with anyone, which then makes the storyline devoid of any true value.Also why does this man choose to live in the most desolate part of the city, especially since he is someone who is elderly and blind. Like why not just move into a regular neighborhood where you wouldn't always be the target of random crime? Also what's the point of adopting the little girl just to keep her isolated and not give her any real childhood?And dont get me started on the meth making, human organ harvesting people. Like first of all their motivation was so unbelievable. You go around the city and kill people just to take their hearts and hope that it'll be a match for the one group members wife?? Also did they really think that a young child's heart would work for a fully grown woman? And even if it did, didn't she have severe lung and throat scarring (and probably a lot of other organ issues) so the heart wouldn't even do her any good!

Last we saw if the blind man, he was being rolled away into an ambulance. What happened after that? Since his house had been broken in to, the police would have certainly found the basement of captivity, chains, padded walls, cryogenically frozen sperm vat, etc....

The bad guys acted threateningly nihilistic in the beginning like a serious sadistic cult but eventually turned out to be a stupid gang as usual being there around the blind guy for a reason.2. They wanted to a perform a highly serious heart transplant in an abandoned hotel with only one creepy surgeon. Really? Do they have to be this dumb and delusional?3. Dogs are very loyal creatures yes but they don't have sense of moral. So if that dog was raised by evil gang, it would be impossible to domesticate it and turn it against them with just an order. Unless of course the blind guy is an enchanter.4. And you get the all stereotypical horror/thriller characters within a cult/gang (stupid weird looking freaks used as killing machines, cold blooded idiotic leader, gothic entitled queen hyena of the cult, and the one who has a good side to him and betrays the gang)5. This is definitely not a horror movie. The style of the movie does not fit in the horror genre, there isn't any suspense or scare or any mystery or any other elements that indicate it's a horror movie. It's an action thriller, slight on the action and more on the thriller.The blind guy was definitely portrayed as an antagonist in the first events of the first movie, so i prefer the evil version of the blind guy although it was controversial in the sense that the blind guy was home and the protagonists who broke into his house.",Don't Breathe 2

I see that many people didn't have a problem with that. In fact, some people liked this changed. But I find it to be problematic. I'm not going to root for the rapist regardless of how much they try to make us empathize with him. And I found it cheap the way they tried doing this, it was clear as day that they wanted us to empathize with and feel bad for him. And they almost had me when he not only didn't kill the dog but also saved it from the fire, but I wasn't going to fall for it like some viewers did. And then they try to make us empathize and root for him even more when the twist is revealed that the little girl's parents are evil and only want her for her heart. What were they trying to do here?I think I would have liked this a lot better if it were more of a continuation of the first and if it didn't make the the blind man the protagonist. They could have written it so that the family of the girl he kidnapped from the first movie came to avenge their daughter. I think that would have been a better watch but that's just my opinion.Also a couple questions I would have liked to know the answer to: How did they find the blind man? How did they know he had their daughter?",Don't Breathe 2

The plot also seems like it tried to humanize the main character with a father/daughter arc, even though he is a pretty unredeemable character given his brutal history. I did not like this approach at all, they should have just kept him as an antagonist.The movie does have a couple of good twists which make it an overall enjoyable film.

I like these what I call B movies (as in not blockbuster) as they have nothing to prove and can therefore really shine by showing their true colours.I felt like there could have been more exposition (I was a bit lost with the story) so I would give this film an 8.5 out of 10 but overall a really good watch.",Don't Breathe 2

294,valeriiegedeshevykh,Clash of Bad Guys,4,3 October 2021,"Don't Breathe is one of the most successful thrillers made in recent years. As someone who started following Fede Alvarez after Evil Dead, I was looking forward to Don't Breathe and it was well worth the wait. When I left the cinema, I was fascinated by the show Fede Alvarez presented to us. But when I left the cinema, I left without thinking that there would be a sequel. There shouldn't have been any more. We have to stop some things, not every movie should have a sequel. Don't Breathe was one of them. Because when you force to continue what is not open to continuation, will seem odd.Let's briefly touch on its subject... The antagonist character of our first movie seems to have survived and somehow found the child he wanted for a very long time. Although he lives happily with her, our little girl not happy att all and does not like the ""closed"" life that her father obligates. While she is looking for an exit door for herself, someone else opens the door for her. But the person who opens this door will not go back without rip-off the door.In general, i'm writing with a little spoiler why I liked the movies I watched, but there is no need to use spoilers for this movie. I don't even think the movie has anything to talk about in depth. In short, the film is a mediocre production that is full of clichés, completely out of context which is tries to slam bad with bad. While the first movie does justice to its thriller genre, it is obvious that the second movie is nothing more than a cheap hero project.Of course, I will write a comparison with the first movie because the gaps between them decrease the quality of the second movie. The first movie was about a blind man's struggle to protect himself and his secrets from thieves who broke into his house. The second movie is about the transformation of a man who tries to protect a -unknown where she came from- girl like a superhero. The first movie was pretty logical in itself. An ex-Navy blind man who knows his home down to the last detail. There is nothing more normal to that man finding everything inside easily. But the second movie takes our character out of the house and after a while we start watching our character Norman Nordstorm as if he is not blind. After the middle of the movie, ""blindness"" loses its meaning and the movie turns into ordinary action.I was very happy to see Fiona O'Shaughnessy in the movie, but I wish we had met in a better movie. For example, a movie where the perverted antagonist isn't turned into a child-loving hero. Although some will like the idea of making bad characters fighting each other, unfortunately it is a very bad and unfortunate choice for the continuation of the first one, which is a great movie.To sum it up... The first movie was the tense story of a blind man and 3 thieves playing a corner in a tight space. Although the story turned to a completely different phase after a point, the story was basically about the puss-in-the corner and it was doing it right. But the second movie, with its unnecessary twist adds exaggerated action to its story, and goes away from its baseline. I wasn't expecting much anyway, but at least I would like to be satisfied with a nice action. But I never thought I would see the clichéd hero man story. It was a pity.",Don't Breathe 2

Would that be interesting?For one, the movie is one of the rare occasions of a good sequel. Different, but very well made. The old man had me rooting for him even in the first movie at times, which is rare to experience from a horror movie. This movie gives the same mixed emotions where you don't know who to like and who not to like. Plot twists and badassery, that is how this movie can be described.In conclusion - forget about the first movie, stop trying to follow expectations!

303,sheakellen,Don't Breathe 2,7,26 September 2021,"A pretty good sequel, I wouldn't say it's as good as the first but it definitely surprised me.Plot Twists - +2This Movie had some pretty interesting plot twists and it sort of makes you think that one point of the plot is going in one certain way, or makes you think that it would do a sort-of cliché with how the story progresses, and then gives you an entirely different perspective.Violence - +1This is a pretty gruesome movie. Way more violent than the first, and I was wanting to see that from the old man character since he didn't get much violent kills in the first, which I felt he could have, but in this movie, there were more opportunities for him, and this movie DEFINITELY took advantage of those opportunities. Overall, I like the violence in this movie.Story - -2The story was a little bit weird because it barely connects to the first movie, if it did at all. I don't know why they added any story to the kid if it didn't have anything to do with the first movie. Just sort of a weird story.Bad Guys - +2This works with the plot twist since you think the bad guys are here for something but they end up telling you something completely different (unexpected).Overall: 7/10.",Don't Breathe 2
304,crushinrussian-52248,A solid sequel,7,26 August 2021,"I am a big fan of the original Don't Breathe. It had a huge amount of surprises up its sleeve for the audience. This sequel stays faithful to the original, although I may have missed how they tie this to the original. HAving said that, this did not distract me in the least from the finished product.The gore is amped up in this one, as are the improbable story conceits. Without revealing the plot, I will say that the change they made to the blind man character definitely causes the movie to take a different path narratively, but it does not cause a contradiction with the story of the first film.All the actors involved did a tremendous job. I especially thought the actors who played the ""parent"" characters were particularly great. The way they play the characters was camp but not unbelievable.The film's cinematography is also a treat. If you have seen the first film, you know that these movies make great use of lighting. This one manages to use an array of color palettes for effect and it all works.Bottom line: if you have seen the first film, you should definitely give this one a chance. I would not say it is better than the original, but it definitely holds its own, both against the orginal and as a horror film in general. If you have not, give this one a go. If you do like it, you will probably end up watching the original anyway just because they are so inventive.",Don't Breathe 2

I think the second film could of been worse going completely horror like the first film since it's the same material we got.In opinion the movie could of gotten more stale if they didn't take the route they chose in the second film.It was nice to get a sense of a creepy old man in the 2nd film.",Don't Breathe 2

Gone are the protracted silences, the suspenseful hiding and the plot twists. In DB2 we find out that The Blind Man was an elite Military member in days gone by, and they use that background to crank up the action and violence. Its now just Blind Rambo as he moves through the bad guys piece by piece. The ""twists"" are predictable and can be seen a mile away, and the action is good but confined to dark places and tight coridors.

Things I cracked up at during the movie:When the power shuts off in the entire building:
""Go check it out."" -cliche' man""He's a navy seal""
""a dead seal, bro"" -man with bloody mouth.""open your jaw"" - man about to STAB THROUGH HIS FRIEND'S cheek with a screwdriver. WTF, it's just superglue, use the screwdriver to open his mouth or clean his nose or poke through the mouth glue, it's not like it's concrete LOL. Proceeds to stab him through the face LMAO, SMH.""Hey, Hey, Hey.... THANKS"" -the mom when they are about to murder the daughter for her heart LOL.The design of the box for a man obsessed with survival was oddly beneficial for someone with a hose to flood said box. Only opening was on the top? Otherwise it was watertight? Also, that big guy couldn't flip the cabinet over but blind guy flips the whole cabinet over WHEN IT'S FULL OF WATER and a PERSON. Have you ever tried to push even a 50 gallon barrel of water over when it's full? NO way was that possible.When the blind guys is on top of the window of the green house thing, hoping to not fall through (he does). But he's just casually hanging out on the glass with a RAGING FIRE under him. That glass would be literally COOKING him.When the blind guy has the 1v1 fight vs Jim Bob mullet guy and they are SO Loud, and battling in the basement right below everyone else...then Raylan demands his cronie go check out the situation...bring ALL the guys LOL. So cronie walks around the corner and there's just 5 guys casually chillin on the staircase paying no attention to their buddy being beat down in the basement.""Now you're gonna see what I see.... THUMBS"" - blind guyThe ridiculous ploy to get the audience to change sides from blind guy = villain to blind guy = hero. I picture the conversation being pitched like this - ""how about we have blind guy's dog get killed by the gang...but then when the blind guy has the opportunity to kill the gang's dog he spares it because he just LOVES puppies man. After that, he even saves the dog from the fire when the gang leader LEFT HIM TO DIE. Clearly a dog realizes the owner double-crossed him and would IMMEDIATELY change allegiance to the blind man that he was trying to murder 15 minutes earlier.""Lastly - when the Dr, who is a serial killer and clearly would be recognized by the outside world, and also is being paid by Raylan to do his job, decides out of nowhere when he sees a fire exit:
""F**k this s**t, I'm out!"" and just takes off LOL.Anyway, again...for $5 totally worth it, I enjoyed the film, even though I laughed at the silliness. I've definitely seen worse.

Antihero Norman/the Blind Man (Stephen Lang), living in a different house than in the first film, has taken in a young girl, Phoenix (Madelyn Grace), who is orphaned due to a house fire. He raises her as his own, teaches her how to defend herself and at the same time is very protective. Not allowing much freedom. She's homeschooled and rarely permitted to leave the house or go into town.When a gang of degenerate thugs attempt to break in and kidnap Phoenix, Norman is forced to defend his home and his so called daughter. The blind war veteran may look harmless but I assure you he's far from it.Stephen Lang plays the role to perfection. Madelyn Grace is also great. The sequel is much more gruesome and gory than its predecessor. With way more nail biting action and suspense, the storyline and character development unfortunately suffer in return. However I was entertained throughout, couldn't quite figure out how it would end and loved where the writers took us.The antagonists, including the leader of the group Raylan (Brendan Sexton III), feel hollow and meaningless. I guess that's expected at times where characters quickly become casualties. Even Phoenix could've had more backstory. Yet the fast paced hardcore action and plethora of thrills definitely make up for the simple storyline and poor character development. We can't have it all I suppose.It's graphically intense. I really enjoyed this film and definitely think it's worth the price of admission. I thought the third act was hella wicked.Psychotic killer or flawed saviour?Thanks for tuning in8/10.",Don't Breathe 2

Given BJV's vile behavior in the first film, I'd rate him slightly more likeable than any character in any Eli Roth movie but much less likeable than child murderer, Freddy Kreuger. Maybe in Don't Breathe 3, BJV can team up with Dokken and battle the Sight Warriors!This movie also features the Oreo thief from Session 9 as a sucky father!Don't Watch!",Don't Breathe 2

353,mottaz-sharkawy,"What a Stupid, unrealistic and unnecessary movie",2,3 September 2021,"This review contains spoiler even though you'd thank me if i spoil it for you as I would have just saved you 90 mins of drivel.Where do I start, there are so much stupidity here that its hard to know where to begin.What made the first movie great is that the entire movie happened in the guy's house and neighborhood which allows him to move freely and with confidence. Here he goes to another house without knowing its dimensions or size, battles a bunch of ex soldiers in an atmosphere that is new to him all whilst he is injured. The house would be difficult to navigate for a person with sight let alone a blind guy. The final fight scene happened in an area where the majority of the floor had an empty swimming pool for goodness sake. The guy didn't fall in and somehow navigated his way through. Why the hell do you even film the scene in an area like this where its so unrealistic.The bad guy that refused to shoot the blind guy why didn't he just help him get the girl. Would have been more realistic. So after all this trouble getting the girl the guy suddenly grew a conscience. OK.At the end when the blind guy finally saves the girl he tells her to stay away and leave right then and there. WTF. He doesn't know if there are anymore people in the house or not. Why don't you get her to safety first then have this conversation. He suddenly decided to be dramatic and just neglect how the girl is gonna get to safety. Get her to a shelter or orphanage then tell her whatever you want. Hell just get her out the house atleast.He also pops the other guys' eyes out and still the other guy who has just been beaten, stabbed and blinded for the first time can navigate himself to where the other blind guy is. The blind guy didn't sense him moving at all even though he sensed a lot less during the entire movie.When they kidnapped the girl why did they wait till she was awake only to tell her how horrible they are and then drug her again. Why didn't you just prepare her for the operation the first time when they brought her. Why do they have to tell her rheir plan and how horrible they really are as parents.The whole idea of how the blind guy came to raise the little girl is so unrealistic. So he was just wondering around and just found a little girl sleeping on the floor so he decided to take her without knowing whether her parents are around or not. And 8 years later her fatger and the little girl just happened to be at the burnt house at the same time. COME ON.What a load of rubbish, utter rubbish.",Don't Breathe 2

I was a bit confused at first by the plot but towards the end the writers did a really good job tying everything together and at the same time still found a way for the audience to empathize with why he did the things that he did.

378,Rtype77,"No, Norman is NOT a hero",10,20 August 2021,"This movie was marketed as a horror but it's definitely more of an action/thriller flick. As such, it does a great job producing more than enough suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat. For those critics who are too caught up with the fact that Norman is not redeemable based on his actions in the first movie and are arguing that this film doesn't justify its existence, please just get over yourselves for a minute and listen up. This film is in no way trying to absolve Norman of his sins, or indicate that he's a good guy, redeemed, a hero, or even an anti-hero. We all know that Norman is a terrible man, and just because he also recognizes this now does not make him good. The only character that shows affinity toward him is Phoenix, and that's because it's the only reality she understands. She is not privy to his past, and even so has a desire to leave him for a better life. Also, for anyone who believes any amount of redemption is not remotely possible, did you also hate American History X? If so, maybe it's time to set your shiny moral compass aside, and realize there are OBJECTIVE ways to review movies too. Now, aside from the fact that I thoroughly enjoyed this film, if I look at things objectively, here are some observations:Story line is unique but complimentary to the first film. Plenty of twists and turns that were unexpected. Despite the looming presence of Norman, overall this is a story about Phoenix's experience navigating a world full of oppression, and selfish, terrible people.Despite some cheesy lines, the acting was intense, solid, and believable. Props to Madelyn Grace for a tour de force breakout performance.Cinematography was stellar, and added so much suspense to the story. The 6 minute long shot of Phoenix evading bad guys in the beginning was a definite highlight. At times the picture was too dark, but it also played well into the suspense.Pacing started out slow, but worked effectively to build suspense. You know things are going to get intense, and when they finally do it's a fun ride.This is an action/thriller, but surprisingly has some elements of drama and humor as well.Overall, this was a solid directorial debut from Rodo Sayagues, and anyone who says it sucked because Fede Alvarez didn't direct doesn't understand the dynamic of this duo. They worked closely together as a creative team on both films, and in the immortal words of Fede, ""I make films to piss you off."" Based on some of the troll-ish critic reviews out there, looks like they succeeded. Well done guys, great film!",Don't Breathe 2
