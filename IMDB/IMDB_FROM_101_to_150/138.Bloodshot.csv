0,Leofwine_draca,Adequate,5,16 October 2020,"BLOODSHOT is the latest movie from producer-star Vin Diesel, here taking a break from car chasing mayhem for some superhuman antics instead. We're in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER territory with the tale of a soldier brought back from the dead and now almost indestructible thanks to some nifty nano technology inside his bloodstream. It's a surprisingly small scale production with some nice performances (Guy Pearce is always welcome) and plenty of action, most of it quite artistic in look and tone. The set-up assassin storyline is age-old but at least the pacing is fast, although there are some very odd decisions here. Oddest of all is shooting a foot chase through the streets of Cape Town which is meant to be London. What were they thinking?!",Bloodshot
1,SnoopyStyle,a bit bland,5,17 April 2020,Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) is an American special force squad leader. He and his wife Gina are kidnapped and brutally murdered by mercenary Martin Axe. Tech entrepreneur Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce) brings him back to life with new powers. KT (Eiza González) is another one of Harting's projects.I don't particularly like Diesel at the start of this movie. He has his moments but this is not one of his best. It's not the worst thing in the world. The plot is functional. The action is bombastic but somehow bland. That's the general takeaway. The movie is trying to be a big comic book superhero origin story but it just lacks something memorable other than Psycho Killer. It comes off as a bland second tier comic book movie.,Bloodshot
2,Prismark10,Bloodshot,5,27 May 2020,"Based on the Valiant Comics character. Bloodshot is a greatest hits of other movies ranging from Universal Soldier, Edge of Tomorrow to Total Recall and Robocop.Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) is a special forces soldier who is kidnapped, interrogated and sees his wife killed in front of him by villain Martin Axe.Shot and left for dead. Ray wakes up and finds out that he has been augmented and genetically enhanced by tech entrepreneur Dr Emil Harting (Guy Pearce).Harting has other such modified soldiers and it seems that Garrison along with his new team will be used to go on high risk missions.Instead Ray immediately goes looking for Axe to take revenge and test out his new powers.However it might be that Ray is just being used in a complex vendetta and not everything is how he recalls it.The story is not much, but there is a fair amount of action scenes and mayhem. Bloodshot works as mindless fun entertainment even though it is derivative.",Bloodshot
3,claudio_carvalho,Clichés but Entertaining,5,5 April 2020,"""Bloodshot"" is a poor collection of ""Universal Soldier"", ""Robcop"", ""Matrix"" and 'Memento"", among other films, that do not work well. The plot is absolutely predictable and it is possible to the viewer to foresee the story. Despite of the clichés, the viewer that is fan of Vin Diesel will certainly find the movie entertaining. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Bloodshot""",Bloodshot
4,nogodnomasters,I got unfinished business,6,7 March 2020,"Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) is a special ops soldier who dies early in the film. But wait, he's not dead yet. A private company takes his body and with the help of CG nano-blood he is back to life, a lean clean fighting machine. When his memory is triggered he then kills his killer and wife's killer, a man who copied Michal Madsen's dance in ""Reservoir Dogs."" But wait, there's more! Then we have ""Total Recall"" and it is game on!The film has a cliche plot and ending. The feature's main attraction is the destructive CG action. I was disappointed when Vin took a truck to drive considering his F&F past. As always when you have super heroes, you must have super villains.Guide: F-word. Near sex. Near nudity.",Bloodshot
5,kosmasp,Shooting blood,7,21 June 2020,"High concept you say? Well Vin Diesel is a trying to bring the 80s back .. film wise that is. Because if you think about it, the concept feels like something from the 80s and it would have worked way better back then I reckon. Still and while I am not aware of the comic books this is based on, the movie can be fun to watch, with that certain twist in it.It's thin and predictable once you get the main idea (if you haven't already read the synopsis of it that is) ... but entertaining. And the effects are good, plus the movie does exactly what it tells you that it will do ... no ""secrets"" there",Bloodshot
6,classicsoncall,"""It's likely that what you think is real, sometimes ain't.""",7,7 September 2020,"Even as far back as the Nineties, there were rumors of a movie being made based on a character from the Valiant Comics universe. I was a huge Valiant fan and collected all the titles up until the dissolution of Acclaim Entertainment in 2004. Bloodshot wasn't one of my favorites, I preferred 'Archer and Armstrong' for it's humor, and 'Eternal Warrior' for the time travel aspects of it's central character. But I did read 'Bloodshot', and it had an interesting premise with it's nanite technology and it's application for enhanced humans.With that, I thought the movie was far better than it had any right to be. Not as good as the films in the Marvel franchise, but even Marvel had it's clunkers. Vin Diesel, upon reflection, seemed a decent choice for the title character given his build; another good one would have been Duane 'The Rock' Johnson. I don't remember much about the 'Bloodshot' comics I read, so I don't know if the origin story told here matches up with that of the series, but it seems close enough. I did like the representation of the 'nanites' that formed the blood of Ray Garrison (Diesel) following the operation that brought him back to life. With a completely programmable system, Bloodshot became one in a long line of movie super-soldiers that includes Robo Cop, Wolverine and the Unisols from ""Universal Soldier"".Story wise, the movie does have it's predictable moments, so in that regard, it's not entirely original. I do credit the film makers with the CGI that made Bloodshot's healing powers look credible, not to mention creepy looking as well. I'm sure the companies involved would like to spin off this movie with a sequel or an accompanying film from the Valiant stable of comics. Like I mentioned earlier, I had my favorites, but they wouldn't seem to fit in with the concepts introduced by ""Bloodshot"". 'Harbinger' and 'Rai' would appear to suggest better possibilities, and I'd be all for it. It's too bad this film found release during the season of Covid-19, as that has greatly limited it's exposure to a more general public. But if the film makers find a way, I think this could be a good alternative universe to rival Marvel and DC.",Bloodshot
7,paul_haakonsen,"Lots of action, but not an impressive script or storyline...",5,26 March 2020,"Right, well I had the chance to sit down and watch the 2020 movie ""Bloodshot"" from director Dave Wilson. I had never heard about this movie prior to getting to sit down and watch it.I must admit that right away I wasn't having much of any expectations to the movie, as it starred Vin Diesel. And I am not overly much of a fan of his, as his performances in movies tends to be very monotonous and tedious. But still, I do like watching movies that I haven't seen before, so I took the time to watch ""Bloodshot"".While the movie definitely is crammed with action and impressive effects, then I will say that the script and storyline was quite far fetched. Sure, it was entertaining, as it is a movie, but the realism in the script was long gone. Which essentially meant that this turned out to be an action movie where you just disconnect your brain and lean back to watch the action and CGI effects.If you have seen one movie with Vin Diesel, then you know what you get in ""Bloodshot"" as well, because the performance here didn't deviate one ounce from what you get in other movies. While that was monotonous, most of the movie was actually made bearable by the performance of Guy Pearce, as he was just fantastic in his role.""Bloodshot"" is an entertaining enough movie for what it turned out to be, but this is hardly an outstanding action movie. And I doubt that I will ever make a second viewing of this 2020 movie.My rating of ""Bloodshot"" settles on a very mediocre five out of ten stars.",Bloodshot

9,CinemaSerf,The colour of your eyes after watching this...,5,12 March 2020,"Vin Diesel has been killed-in-action. He awakens on an operating table in a high-tech facility where he is told by Guy Pearce that his body has been augmented by nanites that make him all but indestructible. With the help of Eliza González he discovers that he is being manipulated into ridding Pearce of some troublesome ex-colleagues by having a series of lethal groundhog days. There are quite an interesting set of scenes set in the UK featuring cars with European licence plates; and he and Sam Heughan feature in one of the longest, dullest fight scenes I've seen since ""Parabellum"". Some decent cash has been spent on the effects, but nowhere near enough on the plot or the script. Another for the telly at Christmas...",Bloodshot
10,zardoz-13,"Bloodshot Surpasses ""Universal Soldier""",8,31 March 2020,"Vin Diesel does a good job of playing himself. Basically, he plays himself in everything, except in his voice-over performances for the Disney/Marvel ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" movies. He typifies the celebrity actor, as opposed to the actor's actor, like either Matthew McConaughey or Leonard DiCaprio. Diesel realizes his range is narrow, so he confines himself shrewdly to those roles. Sometimes, he ventures outside his comfort zone to act. For example, he dressed in a suit, tie, and let his hair grow out for Sidney Lumet's top-notch courtroom crime drama ""Find Me Guilty"" (2006) where he was an Italian mobster defending himself! Currently, Diesel stars in three franchises: ""The Fast & Furious,"" ""Riddick,"" and ""xXx."" Incredibly, Lionsgate is planning a Diesel-driven sequel to ""The Last Witch Hunter"" (2015)! Now, in his first, live-action, superhero saga, Diesel plays the bestselling Valiant Comic book champion ""Bloodshot,"" and comparisons between ""Universal Soldier"" (1992) and it are inevitable. Principally, Diesel's heroic super-soldier, Ray Garrison, boasts abilities far beyond anything Jean Claude Van-Damme's Luc Deveraux could muster in ""Universal Soldier.""Loyal ""Bloodshot"" fans may criticize this $45-million cinematic adaptation because the filmmakers tampered with its source material. ""Bloodshot"" deviates from the comic book origin story about a mobster in witness/protection, Angelo Mortalli, who the FBI betrays. Instead, Diesel plays a murdered U.S. Marine in freshman film director David Wilson's ""Bloodshot"" who finds himself resurrected as a virtually invincible warrior. Millions of microscopic nanites swarming in his blood Bloodshot as indestructible as Wolverine. These predatory, Origami-looking, nano-tech bots heal all injuries within seconds! Nevertheless, the side effects forge nightmares stemming from his memory loss. Not surprisingly, Bloodshot shrinks from the revelation that the 21st century equivalent of Dr. Frankenstein has reanimated him. Initially, Ray Garrison doesn't remember anything, but he remains convinced someone has murdered his wife and then slain him, too!Whether in the Valiant Comics or this Columbia Pictures incarnation, ""Bloodshot"" takes the resurrected ""Universal Soldier"" type hero to its pinnacle. Scenarists Jeff Wadlow of ""Kick-Ass 2"" and Eric Heisserer of ""Arrival"" appropriate elements from ""The Bourne Identity,"" ""RoboCop,"" ""Source Code,"" ""The Matrix,"" and ""Crank 2."" Mind you, ""Bloodshot"" amounts to absurd nonsense, but Diesel's steely presence makes it worth watching. Credibility and logic vanish after the slam-bang pre-credit action sequence which concludes with our hero's demise! The story unfolds with the tenacious Garrison (Vin Diesel of ""The Fast & The Furious"") rescuing a white, male hostage held in Mombasa, Kenya, from a trigger-happy fanatic. Flown to the nearest base aboard a military transport, Ray reunites with his wife, Gina Garrison (Talulah Riley of ""Mojave""), and they take a vacation in scenic Italy.Abruptly, everything goes sideways. Psychotic killer Martin Axe (Toby Kebbell of ""Warcraft"") abducts Gina and threatens to kill her. Ray must divulge who tipped him off about the hostages in Mombasa. Since his superiors didn't confide in him, Ray doesn't know. Abruptly, Axe kills Gina! Vowing hellfire revenge, Ray advises Axe to finish him off. Axe accepts Ray's advice and dispatches him. Although Ray has died, he regains consciousness in the ultra-sophisticated, super-secret nanotechnology labs of Rising Spirit Technology. This is a private military contractor which rebuilds wounded warriors. A bespectacled scientist, Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearson of ""Memento""), welcomes an incredulous Ray and celebrates this miraculous resurrection. Initially, Ray cannot believe he has been brought back from the dead like Lazarus.Since it is an origins opus, ""Bloodshot"" concentrates on Ray Garrison's bionic rebirth. Earlier, Harting's first experiments involved cybernetic parts implanted in humans augmented as a consequence of their physical handicaps. First, former Navy rescue diver KT (Eiza Gonzalez of ""Baby Driver"") boasts modified lungs, so she is completely immune to chemical inhalants. Second, although Iraqi artillery took his eyesight, Tibbs (Alex Hernandez of ""Samuel's Game"") has ocular prosthetics linked to an array of cameras that feed data to his optic nerves, so he can see better than ever. Third, combat deprived Jimmy Dalton (Sam Heughan of ""The Spy Who Dumped Me"") of his feet. Harting engineered robotic replicas for him. Now, Dalton charges around like a cheetah. Harting uses KT as the go-between Garrison and himself, while Tibbs and Dalton serve as Harting's henchmen. They struggle without success to control Bloodshot when he defies Harting. Predictably, the rivalry between Bloodshot and Dalton boils over into a cliffhanger scene of close-quarters combat.As it turns out, Harting uses Bloodshot to murder scientists and technicians who have defected from his ranks. The RST honcho deludes Ray Garrison into believing each of Harting's former employees orchestrated the brutal murder of his wife Gina. Eventually, Bloodshot realizes Harting has been manipulating him the entire time. At this point, Harting dispatches Dalton and Tibbs to retrieve Bloodshot. Predictably, this objective is easier ordered than accomplished. Director David Wilson indulges himself in an impressive display of computer-generated imagery which illustrates how bullets and bombs disintegrate Bloodshot until his body reassembles itself. Once our hero realizes Harting and his henchmen constitute his real enemies, Bloodshot resolves to destroy them. Dalton suits up in a multi-limbed, exoskeletal combat gear that resembles Dr. Otto Octavius in ""Spiderman 2"" with Toby Maguire.Clocking in at an hour and forty-nine minutes, ""Bloodshot"" rarely runs out of either momentum or mayhem. Once you recover from the showstopping pre-credit sequences, you have the remainder of the movie to admire how our indestructible protagonist contends with the issue of his own immortality. Repeatedly, Bloodshot's enemies obliterate him with ordnance, but to little effect, since those nanites mend him in a frenzy. Occasionally, Bloodshot must recharge himself like Luc Deveraux in ""Universal Soldier."" Once Bloodshot engages in combat, however, nothing can defeat him. Meantime, Wilson stages some stunning action sequences. In one of the most sensational exploits, Bloodshot barricades an underground tunnel with a demolished 18-wheeler, wipes out an army of mercenaries and then executes one of his primary assailants. Vin Diesel looks like he enjoyed playing this larger-than-life hero in this outrageous but exciting fantasy.",Bloodshot
11,Calicodreamin,Enjoyable mindless action,8,14 March 2020,"Went in with no expectations and was pleasantly surprised. I enjoyed the action mixed with new age technology. The premise was interesting and the storyline well developed. The acting was fairly good, and the action well choreographed. The cinematography was amazing and there were some really beautiful shots.",Bloodshot
12,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"You may not need a past to have a future, but you do need a better-than-decent film to get a franchise",5,8 November 2020,"U.S. Marine Ray Garrison(Diesel, sleepwalking through this) is killed, and is resurrected by the RST organisation. They've replaced all of his blood with nanites(oh don't worry, it's going to get much more ridiculous. And if this was just significantly more entertaining, a lot of us could go with it), giving him rapid healing(sadly, he's a lot less interesting than Wolverine), and increasing his strength and speed.Let's pretend that we didn't see the trailer and have everything spoiled. Bad marketing shouldn't be allowed to ruin a good product. Honestly, it's not like they couldn't have made it look appealing without giving away the twists. There are other compelling things about this property. I haven't read the comics - I would like to. Even if I hadn't heard that they were great, I'd figure they were a lot better than this. I'm going to try not to dwell on the fact that, similar to Assassin's Creed with Michael Fassbender, this was something that was never going to work as well as a movie adaptation as it did in its original format.The various augmentations are cool, clever and see (at least a little) memorable use. There's even stuff involving multiple enhanced soldiers. I do wish more of it was fighting, and less of it was chasing. Literally every single action scene in this is uniquely different from the rest of them, and there are several that I haven't seen something very similar to in any other flick. It can be incoherent and it overuses slow motion.How is the plot both so slow to even start, and yet able to then stall almost immediately? Why was it apparently impossible for them to make anyone other than KT(González, getting way too little to do) sympathetic? What is the point of introducing so many pieces of potentially badass sci-fi tech, if it's all going to be used so little? Who working on this was in love with the effect of Bloodshot reforming a part of his body that was just blown apart, and couldn't they have been removed from this? When will studios learn, that if you make a movie out of a graphic novel that is *very* of its time, you have to to do something to update it? Where did all the fascinating ideas disappear to, after the cast talked them up in interviews?This contains violence that is at times just short of an R-rating in gore, and some moderately strong language, and some hinted-at sex. I recommend this only to those who feel obligated to watch, whether it's based on liking the source material or being a fan of someone working on it. 5/10",Bloodshot
13,view_and_review,Formulaic,2,16 March 2020,"Part of me was thinking, ""Don't waste your time. Leave the superhero movies to Marvel and DC."" While another part of me was thinking, ""It's good to have a third player in the game, maybe they will be real creative and come up with a concept even better than Marvel and DC.""Well it failed. And it failed trying to basically hold on to the formula that made so many prior superhero movies successes. Put another way, if this works for all of the others then it should also work for us. So what you got was a heavy dose of CGI, hero poses, and slow-mo destructive scenes; also a rote hero and megalomaniac antagonists with the same old motives (in fact, this antagonist was the very same actor who played the antagonist in Iron Man 3). It was just a lame comic book movie where the protagonists look like cardboard cutouts.Ray (Vin Diesel) was a soldier, and perhaps he was even a super soldier. At some point he was either killed or injured to the point of inefficacy so he was offered up to a company called RST to be made into a super super-soldier. Ray was, through the wonders of technology, made into a body coursing with nanobots that made him like Wolverine with his regenerative ability, like Captain America with his strength, and like Punisher with this drive for revenge or getting even. Or maybe we should say like the Punisher with his drive for meting out his own form of justice.He was opposed by--whenever he was opposed by anyone of any significance--other semi super-soldiers. One such soldier was a Doc Oc type (meaning Doctor Octagon from Spider-Man 2), the other super soldier was like Hawkeye with his vision, and then everyone else was just an extra to rack up a high body count.His biggest advocate was a super-sexy super-soldier named KT (Eiza Gonzalez), who had to breathe through an apparatus on her chest. She was a water rescuer in the navy, but maybe since joining RST she was able to develop her skills as a Black Widow-like fighter because that's essentially what she was. Also assisting him was Wilfred Wigans (Lamorne Morris), a computer geek who, surprisingly, resembled more of Don Cheadle's character in ""Ocean's Eleven"" down to the British accent.So there you have a taste of a few characters you've probably seen in other better movies all here in this movie as though they're something new and special. It is a very very formulaic superhero movie. It is atrociously formulaic to the point you wonder if the writers and creator of this had one single original thought.",Bloodshot

The infrasonic growling voice, the walking through bombs and bullets like he's invincible. The best scene of the entire film was the starting one, where they show him off as this really badass soldier with lightning fast reflexes and a sense of where the enemy might be. From then on it was all just running through walls, punching concrete, etc. Oh, and the woman was a femme fatale and all the devs were smart but pathetic.Bottom line: probably the Van Damme one is still better.

17,thesar-2,Michael Bay's RoboBorg,5,23 August 2020,"Or...How I Learned to T-1000 My Enemies.Really kinda sad here. If not for the TERRIBLE CGI at times and the 40 extra minutes of SLOOOOOOO-MO, I would've loved this movie so much more. But, seriously, despite this being based on a comic book, this couldn't have been more comical in the most needed action scenes.The first act was so predictable and, again, filled with terrible CGI and slo-mo, but I stuck with it. I swear Vin Diesel, though not my type, has a draw on me. He has this charisma that keeps me going. So, I stuck with it and when the twist (EARLY ON - so no spoilers) is revealed, I was pleasantly rewarded for my patience. Not so predictable anymore, eh?Basically, the Hulk in human, military mode is taken hostage and his lovely, too perfect wife is used as leverage for information. Full-Stop - the second she was introduced, I was like: Okay, when is she gonna die? Sure enough, it was maybe 10-minutes later.But, so did Vin Diesel's soldier husband, Ray aka Bloodshot. Or...so We THOUGHT! Enter Guy Pearce, head of special ops of robo-cops and he six-million-dollar (probably more) rebuilds Ray for special missions. But, there's gotta be more behind this too-easy setup. Ray will fight to get the Total Recall he needs to figure out what happened to him.I did like this. I just can't deal with the slo-mo and laughable CGI effects. I just wish if they didn't have the budget for perfected CGI, then they would've got an additional producer. Additionally, if you take out all the slo-mo, like in many Michael Bay movies, it would've been much tighter and swifter to watch.I would definitely recommend it, because when that twist kicks in, the movie really does take off.***Final thoughts: I need to mention there's a lot of genuine LOL moments here, some action scenes really work, the cast is great and I do love me some Superman-type heroes. So...yeah, this IS a recommendation. One of Vin Diesel's better flicks.",Bloodshot
18,FeastMode,really stupid... but kinda cool?,4,23 August 2020,"I'm not really sure why i didn't give this a worse score. the movie is bad. it fails in basically everything it tries to do. it's sloppy and poorly made. but for some reason i didn't hate it. and i was smiling for a lot of it. i even thought about giving it a 5/10 but it felt wrong.i went into this movie blind. i could tell pretty early on that it would max out at ""entertaining action flick."" but the action was poorly shot and hard to see for the most part. most of the comedy fell flat. some was so bad it made me roll my eyes. it was completely predictable. filled with continuity errors and bad ADR. sloppy story telling and directing.on top of all that, it's filled with stupid moments, things that don't make sense, madness-type logic, and general things you can make fun of.having said all that, i can't explain why, but i was still relatively entertained by this movie. even some of the bad action scenes were pretty cool. one of them even gave me goosebumps, an awesome moment with some beastly music.because of the COVID movie drought, there haven't been any new movies in a while, and i haven't watched a movie in over two weeks, which is the longest stretch for movie in probably 10+ years. so assume this score has an asterisk. because there is some pretty indefensible stuff here. but... i love stupid action movies and i would probably watch a sequel rofl (1 viewing, 8/22/2020)

the predictable part i mentioned was when they awkwardly showed the wedding ring on his wife's hand, which immediately caused me to think... she's going to die, and not later in the movie, probably in the next 5 minutes... do better plzthe action scene that gave me goosebumps was at the end of the movie when he went super saiyan. with the music, that moment was pretty epic.",Bloodshot
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Blood, sweat and nanobots.",6,15 March 2020,"Surprisingly, 'Bloodshot (2020)' isn't bad. It's sometimes genuinely enjoyable in a camp kind of way, especially in its opening moments, and it's often rather entertaining even when it isn't, for all intents and purposes, all that great. There's some decent action (as well as some not-so-decent action, of course), the performances are all pretty much on point and the narrative does a lot more than you'd expect it to. The movie has a number of generic twists and turns that are somewhat interesting in their execution and its visual effects are often rather impressive (though, again, they often aren't). Sure, the piece is cheesy and outdated, but it's actually kind of fun. However, there's always this element of mediocrity present. Even when you're entertained, you're always aware of some issue. That, along with the fact that it's only ever so good in the first place, makes for an experience that rests somewhere between 'alright' and 'good enough'. It helps that Vin Diesel is just an inherently funny human being, a bit of a walking meme. His presence definitely elevates this, even if it's difficult to put your finger on why exactly that is. Ultimately, this is a decent flick that does exactly what it needs to without taking itself too seriously. It's not great, but it's better than you'd think it would be. 6/10",Bloodshot

22,Cineanalyst,Misshapenly Clever,8,10 November 2020,"I wonder if some critics even really want clever scenarios, or whether they just want pictures that look pretty and are well paced, and, granted, I like pretty, well-paced pictures, too. For ""Bloodshot,"" indeed, is ugly and choppy. Some of the color correction is hideously garish, especially the yellow in some of the exteriors, and much of the picture looks as though it were photographed by a Michael Bay wannabe with some imitation of ""The Matrix"" (1999) mixed in. The action scenes, down to Vin Diesel's glowing chest and the parkour capabilities of a character with artificial legs and arms, come off as perfunctory. Dialogue tends to be insipid, too, with the camera not even always focused on Diesel's face as he seemingly provides bad ADR for his rejoinders. Meanwhile, computer wizzes are stereotyped as unmanly types amidst all of the machismo, with one of them serving for one of the worst dick jokes I've ever heard in a movie. Somewhere along the way from comic-book adaptation and beneath the superhero, action-junk veneer, however, there's conceptual, reflexive cleverness here. It's one of my favorite kind of movies--one about its own making.""Universal Soldier"" (1992) revenge tale meets the meta narrative construction of Tony Scott's underappreciated ""Déjà Vu"" (2006), or, say, the time-loop artifice of Duncan Jones's ""Source Code"" (2011). Or, more precisely, ""Bloodshot"" follows a thread of reflexive, deconstructed superhero movies we've already seen, namely ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" (2019), largely praised because it looks pretty and is well paced, and another underrated, allegedly boring one, ""Glass"" (2019). By the way, if you haven't seen these three movies yet, you might want to stop reading this review now, as I'm going to talk a bit about how they deconstruct their genre.""Glass"" is the more old-school, following a meta-narrative tradition that may be traced back to comic-book origins with Superman, whose alter ego of Clark Kent and, more so, his coworker Lois Lane, wrote the superhero's story for the Daily Planet newspaper. It's the story-within-the-story, then. ""Glass"" is about the making of the film-within-the-film, as Samuel L. Jackson's character orchestrates for the supes to perform in front of cameras. Like Superman, however, the conceit of ""Glass"" is that the fictional metahumans are real in the story. The conflict between reality and illusion takes center stage in ""Far from Home,"" though, where Spidey's powers are ""real,"" but Jake Gyllenhaal's (hey, the same guy from ""Source Code,"" as it so happens) Mysterio's powers are faked through a system of visual effects and projection--like the movie itself for us, the audience. There's a subplot, to boot, that revolves around a shapeshifting species and the same Samuel L. Jackson partaking in a virtual vacation. Clever stuff for superhero franchises.As for ""Bloodshot,"" everything is manufactured, artificial and enhanced, implanted and dreamed, constructed, photographed and ran through computers. The big twist comes early when the spectator is apprised of the artifice--confronting us with our own supposed suspension of disbelief, as it were. Ultimately, of course, the suggestion is that everything we see in ""Bloodshot"" is a simulation. I really like the association of cinema with dreams, as Diesel's protagonist dies, or sleeps, before the illusion is placed in his mind. The doctor played by Guy Pearce (another nice bit of casting, as Pearce may be best known for starring in a mind-game film also about manipulated memories, ""Memento"" (2000)) even reprimands his computer wiz for ripping off movie conventions in his dream constructions. The murderer's dancing to pop music taken from ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) being one of the more obvious borrowings.So, we have movies as dreams and a movie dreaming other movies. The entire charade, or trick, of the story of manipulating Bloodshot's series of revenge killings is about filmmaking, too. Pearce's doctor and the rest of his team are actors played by actors--pretending characters who are pretending to be other characters (should he fake being a former tennis pro again, for instance), to fool Diesel's surrogate for us, the movie spectator. Moreover, these actors are also the filmmakers. Indeed, one of them is made up of a system of cameras--an otherwise ""blind"" character, which is kind of apt for a poorly-photographed picture, but I digress. Look at all of the viewpoints framed by diegetic cameras in this one: those by the blind cameraman, but also by computer screens, surveillance video and satellite imagery--and from the mind's eye of Bloodshot's implanted dreams. It may not all be well executed, but it's quite cleverly conceived.Finally, there's the process by which all of these movies are largely made nowadays, by technology and through computers. All of the action is framed by characters enhanced by fantastical technology and as created by the computer-generated imagery from their computer coders. Movies implanted as memories and action scripted through computers. There's the guy regenerated by nanorobots, risen from the dead like Frankenstein's monster and akin to the life-death-and-reanimation process of film recording itself, from the deathly capturing of a series of still images to the projection of their reassembled motion. He gets into fisticuffs with an arm man, a leg man and the cameraman, but the real battle is played out via computer hacking. It's all a simulation, so it's all about who can better write simulations.At least someone who wrote ""Bloodshot,"" whether it's the comics, which I'm not familiar with, or the screenwriters, recognized what these movies are ultimately about, although I do wonder what the visual-effects houses that make much, if not most, of what we see on screen make of the junk of turning computer nerds into unathletic, small-penis caricatures who never win the standard prize in such schlock of a female mate (and ""Far from Home"" does essentially the same thing). The woman in this one, by the way, gets about the least interesting power, too, of being able to breath under water while being subjected to the male gaze and otherwise suffocating under her male master. Moreover, given how much these movies are made by committee, with ""Bloodshot"" also being planned as part of a franchise, although we'll have to see how much the pandemic shutting down theatres during its release puts a wrench in those works, it's not surprising that even if such superhero fare is conceived intelligently that it ends up looking rather dumb. Look past the simulation, though, and you might see that this was really kind of smart.",Bloodshot
23,westsideschl,Comic Book Fantasy,8,7 May 2020,"Unlike ""The Rhythm Section"" which was a more realistic tale of someone becoming a revenging superhero this script is straight out of comic book fantasy - no real here. We have a blood stream filled not with blood, but little alien looking nano spiders busily repairing every mishap, i.e. get an arm blown off; within seconds they have made you a new one (forget where all the minerals/calcium for bone, and organic materials for muscle, nerves, etc. came from). The usual formula bad/mad industrialist scientist out to make a load of money & sell his little nano buddies to the highest bidder. Worth eight stars only because the script was a little different & the CGI was fairly decent (although the now decade old grayish swirling stuff is still the main CGI du jour).",Bloodshot
24,The-Sarkologist,Pretty good last film to see before the lockdown,7,14 April 2020,"Well, this is probably going to be the last of the new release movies that I am going to see for a while, particularly since most of the movies have been put on hold for at least six months. Still, it certainly was a film to go out with a bang, despite the fact that even though it was definitely a science-fiction style action film that happened to be based on a comic. Actually, a part of me suspected that it was based on a comic as I started watching it, but then again I still liked it.So, this guy wakes up in a room and has been told that he had died and that the US had given him over to them to run experiments on namely because he happened to be one of those soldiers that had died without having any real connections with the real world. At first all of his memory has been wiped, but then has some flashbacks and realises that this particular guy killed him and his wife, so he steals a plane, flies to Europe, and basically kills him. Well, that seemed to be pretty straight forward except, well, there is much, much more to this film, though I don't necessarily want to say anymore since it might give too much away.Yeah, this is one of those supersoldier type movies, and what we find out is that the protagonist has been filled with nanites which mean that he is pretty much immortal, though of course we do learn that these nanites do have a tendancy to overheat, so I guess he isn't anywhere near as immortal as he looks, but of course being a super-soldier it does make him rather hard to kill. So, I guess the question comes down to how do you challenge this guy?Well, I guess, like a lot of these films, you send him up against the people that made him namely because if some company is going to make a soldier like him then surely they can't be up to no good. Another interesting thing is that their base happens to be all the way over in South East Asia, which is not surprising either since the best place to actually build, and experiment, on such technology, is in a country that happens to be somewhat corrupt (though I don't believe the country where the film is set is anywhere near as bad as some countries out there).Look, it really isn't anything all that insightful, though I do quite like the twist, despite the fact that the trailer did eventually give it away so I did know what was coming. I guess that is the problem when it does come to trailers, though of course there are some people out there that are experts at trailers in that you get enough of the movie to want to see it, but it doesn't spoil the plot twist. Unfortunately, that isn't quite the case with Bloodshot.",Bloodshot
25,slightlymad22,Eliza González Was A Joy,6,11 March 2020,"I just got out of BloodshotI didn't like it, but I wouldn't say I hated it. It is a very silly film that is seemingly aware (At least I hope it is) of how silly it is. It's pretty tame violence and blood wise, it's pretty much all in the trailers which is disappointing.It's full of cliche's, it's action is routine and the effects whilst not bad, are not mind blowing either, there isn't much humour, but I have to say it is hard to hate a film that includes a dick joke which takes 20 minutes to pay off.Of the cast Vin Diesel is a bit bland and Guy Pierce is hamming it up but Eliza González was joy as KTIt features two things I hate in movies, people eating noisily (when they'd never really eat at that moment) and when you see the back of someone's head (Vin Diesel for example) whilst he is talking, but what you can see of the side of his face, clearly does not match what he is saying.There were 16 other people in my screening.

Yet, according to Rotten Tomatoes 78% of the audience liked it. I agree more with the 78%, as I actually enjoyed it.Let's be honest, the premise is nothing new. In fact, the film reminded me of 'The Matrix', 'Source Code', 'Assassins Creed', and 'Edge of Tomorrow', to name but a few. I really loved the photography, cinematography, stunning locations, beautiful score, and fantastic visuals. The tunnel scene was absolutely spectacular! Wow, it was impressively well photographed!Vin Diesel was being just Vin Diesel again. He can't seem to shake that 'Fast and the Furious' persona, no matter what he does. Maybe it's his voice - similar to Jason Statham. They sound the same in every film they do, and personifies type casting. I thought Guy Pearce was very good.'Bloodshot' is a vengeance film, but with a twist. Actually, there's a lot of surprises and twists here - maybe a bit too many to keep track, but either way, still enjoyable. I have a feeling the film will feel stale very quickly after a few views, but it was a lot of fun seeing it for the first time. The film's climax is mostly CGI and nothing new, but it was still well done and very exciting.Would I watch it again? Yes.",Bloodshot

30,Dr_Coulardeau,Deranged Dystopipc Pseudo-Science,8,27 January 2021,"A rather big-budget B-movie. In the old days, B-movies were determined by the small budgets they worked on. Some of those small-budget films could contain at times very interesting ideas even if they were not exploited properly because of the lack of funds. But since they invented special effects - that are expensive - you can have B-movies that do not show the zipper in the back, and at times the front of the actors and monsters. So technically with special effects, you can have B-movies that look great and can satisfy an audience, particularly a young audience used to video games.What makes a B-movie today is not the technical use of special effects or the non-use of them. Nor is it the small budget. It is the plot itself, the story, the characterizations of the various parts, the art and quality of the actors - and, mind you, it is not only a question of names and stars, since younger actors can reveal themselves in such parts in such films. DiCaprio after all started his career in B-movies that revealed him, and he could move fast to better films.This film is a romance in a dystopic futuristic American-dominated and science-enslaved social fantasy. Everything in it is impossible and will always be. To replace the whole blood of a person with several hundred million nanobots in the line Ray Kurzweil suggested with his proposal to inject in the bloodstream several hundred thousand such nanobots. But Ray Kurzweil kept the blood. This film gets rid of that. That's funny but impossible. It is transforming this society of ours into a pure frontier for the military-industrial complex that will eventually get rid of the simple biological humans, except those who are necessary for ancillary tasks, provided they are very obedient. The elite, and even more than the elite, will be such artificial robots with a fully human body but with the nanorobotic stream in their veins.That is already very surprising but spectacular with special effects. But when this nanorobotic man falls in love with another of these scientifically manipulated humans, a woman, mind you, since we have to remain within normal gender orientation, and these two will manage to completely evade the military-industrial complex's control and to be able to live unknown and unnoticed for the rest of their life ever after. That's good. With all those millions of nanobots in his veins, the poor man is a perambulating beacon probably triggering all security alarms and signals within hundreds of kilometers, except maybe if he remains within a totally lead-shielded container with no communication, not even as a waste exhaust with and into the outside world. And will lead be enough to shield this small inhabitable unit from modern and future science? I doubt it.So, let yourself be eaten up by this dystopic fantasy and forget about it as soon as you reach the end. I just wonder why I write a review of it, after all.Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU",Bloodshot

32,leonblackwood,Terrible script with average action scenes! 3/10,3,26 August 2020,"Review:
What an awful film! The acting was terrible from the WHOLE cast, and the storyline was completely ridiculous. I don't know if the makers were trying to stay true to the comic, but that's no excuse for such a terrible attempt at an action/sci-fi film. Even the established actors, Vin Diesel and Guy Pearce weren't that great, and all of the technical jargon went straight over my head. I didn't understand how in one scene, Ray Garrison is learning how to use his newfound strength, and in another scene, he's able to hack into computers and go rouge! After watching the whole film, it all came together but I really wasn't that impressed. The only saving grace was the fight on the lift towards the end, but the CGI was pretty bad. Although I'm a fan of Diesel, I'm beginning to question his acting ability because he only seems to be starring in films where he has to wear a vest, and kill baddies. Outside the Fast & Furious franchise, his films don't really make a big impact, so maybe it's time for him to prove that he's not just muscles with corny one-liners. As for Guy Pearce, this will have to go down as a bad day at the office, and I can't see the other actors gaining any respect for there performances. In all, this film was a massive letdown, and I hope they don't attempt to make a sequel. Awful!Round-Up:
This is the first film directed by Dave Wilson, who must be pretty disappointed with the box office takings, even though he had Diesel on board. He could have easily made this into two films, by spending some time character building, except for jumping straight in at the deep end. With Bloodshot being one of the most popular characters in the 80 million comics selling Valiant Universe, it was a much-anticipated film but it failed in every category. It seemed like the director concentrated on the action scenes, more than the actual storyline, so the flow of the movie was jumpy. Anyway, with another Fast and Furious movie due to be released soon, and a role in the upcoming Avatar 2 and the Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3, Diesel will be able to put this far in the back of his mind, with the hope that no one will bring up the subject ever again.Budget: $45million

35,southdavid,Not even a Valiant effort,4,18 March 2020,"This is not good. Not good at all. On the most part it's competent enough, but it's so pedestrian and overdone it's near impossible to actively enjoy it.Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) is a Special Ops soldier whose wife is murdered in front of him following a successful hostage rescue. He too is killed, but then wakes up in a laboratory setting some months later. Donated to medical science by the army, the engineers have infused his blood with nanobots that will rebuild his body, in real time, as it is destroyed by bullets, knives and explosions. However, Garrison has no memory of his previous life. That is until a chance encounter triggers him and he sets out, with his new powers, to avenge his loss.So, there's lots to dislike about ""Bloodshot"", sadly that starts with its star. I could charitably describe Diesel as a ""throwback to 80's action stars"" but what I mean by that is that he's incapable of expressing any form of emotion beyond anger, and even that's not convincing. So loss, betrayal, confusion all pass by without him so much as taking off a trademark Dom Toretto White vest. That said, it's not like the plot gives him much to work with - there's more going on than I've detailed in my synopsis above but nothing so dramatic or inventive that you won't constantly be ahead of the story, which the film also cribs from other movies, notably ""The Matrix"".I'm never usually critical of this, as it's never normally quite as striking as it is here, but there was little, if any, attempt to convince the audience that the ""London"" chase scene actually takes place in London. Aside from the fact it doesn't look at all like London; the houses, streets and gardens are all wrong - there's no attempt to change the numberplates or the look of the police car, for example. And it's not like it being in London was integral to the story, just say it's in Cape Town, or Budapest, or wherever they actually filmed that scene!All those criticisms aside, I did enjoy the elevator set piece that comes near the films conclusion and from a visual effects standpoint, that work is pretty good. It's just that those elements are part of a movie that is so far below par these days, it's not worth your time.",Bloodshot
36,subxerogravity,"Well, if it doesn't do good, Vin can always blame it on the coronavirus.",6,14 March 2020,"It was ok.
It seems like every time Vin is about to drop one of his billion dollar Fast and Furious film franchises, he also drops a b-movie that same year. B as in the type of movie that would have not made it into theaters if it was not for Vin's uncanny star power. This year's movie its Bloodshot.
I hear the coronavirus outbreak forced Fast 9 to be pushed back a year, so if you are really into Vin Diesel this maybe your only kick for 2020.
No where near as good as a Fast and Furious movie, Vin does get to play a full on bonafide comic book superhero (instead of just voicing one), and that was cool to see(possibly cooler if I was into the comic instead of just knowing it existed).
Past my likening of Vin the film itself overall is a by the book formula that failed with the creative story they try to fit it with.
The timing is just off. They get to a point where we can tell this is a cool idea but then the formula forces the idea to fall short.
However, Bloodshot is filled with some cool visuals and a few cool action scenes but still, it has too many boring parts.
Got to throw some shade on my man Guy Pearce too. He was a horrible bad guy and not in the good way. I expected better.
It's too bad Ezia Gonzalez was only obviously used to parade around and look sexy, at the same time I'm thankful cause it brought something extra to the movie(and it needed extra)
Take if for what it is, a b-movie. If you're ever at home and wonder ""what else has Vin done otter than 9 fast movies?"" Find it on a steaming service. Don't risk catching anything trying to see this in theaters.",Bloodshot
37,jtindahouse,Another bland comic book movie that is at least made well,6,26 March 2020,"I didn't actually know for sure that 'Bloodshot' was a comic book movie while watching it (I've never heard of the character 'Bloodshot' before now) but it certainly had that feel about it. It struggles with all the problems most comic book based movies do. The more powerful the character is the less fun he is to watch. Why can't filmmakers get this through their head? The reason the 'Dark Knight' trilogy worked so well was because Batman was made into a mortal human being. Sure he had gadgets and a suit, but under that he was simply a well-trained man. When 'Bloodshot' is walking toward someone and they are shooting him in the face to no effect, where is the fun in that?For a first directing effort Dave Wilson has put together a pretty clean movie. It is nicely shot, the action sequences are at least filmed well and the pacing is decent. It is hard to fault it in terms of production. The film does suffer from having a PG-13 rating. It feels incredibly safe, both in terms of dialogue and violence. The dialogue especially suffers and ensures that none of the jokes land (and there are a tremendous amount of jokes attempted, particularly in the second half of the film). I can imagine this being a far better film with an R rating. It would give the movie so much more freedom to work with.Sadly, 'Bloodshot' is about as forgettable as films come. There is nothing here to make the film unique or special in any way. Considering they are currently charging $19.99 to watch this (roughly $35 in New Zealand) I would suggest waiting until the price comes way down.

41,alindsay-al,A Below Average generic action film,4,2 April 2020,"With the recent issues with cinemas, this film was made available to watch at home and I have now watched Bloodshot and here is my review for the film. The premise of the film sees a soldier killed in action and ressurected in order to become a super soldier hell bent on revenge.
Main Character
Vin Diesel is the main character in this film and if you have seen any film with Diesel in then you know what you are getting from his main performance. He is good in the action scenes and very believeable in the role and I know it sounds crazy but I actually think he delivered some good acting moments in the film to try and make his character rise above the average material that he is given.
Supporting Characters
Lamorne Morris plays the research Wiggins and I think for some people in this film he will be the most annoying part in this film, but I actually found him pretty entertaining to watch and he provided a bit of humour to this pretty drab film. Guy Pearce plays the main scientist in the film but he is the most generic character imaginable, he is a good actor but he literally has nothing to work with in this film and I thought anybody could have played that role. Eiza Gonzalez plays a female ally of Diesel but you learn pretty much nothing about her character and she again is a really generic character. The henchmen in the film are all boring characters and this film completley wastes a great character in Tobby Kebbell.
Story
The story in the film is probably one of the most bland and generic in recent memory, what doesn't help is that the trailer spoils the majority of the twists and it hurts the enjoyment levels of the film. Though even if you haven't watched the trailer you can guess where this film is going and the film does very little to add anything new as it has all been seen before.Script
The script is also generic, the dialogue feels very basic and lacking anything memorable whatsoever. The humour isn't consistent and the drama never hits the level required for it to be considered emotional and just a bland script overall.Style
It cannot be denied that there are some exciting action scenes in this movie, it is entertaining to watch this super soldier go through a group of bad guys. But my negatives for the style is there is a big overuse on slow motion during the majority of action scenes and it feels like we have been transported back to the late 90's which feels out of date for the film.Overall
Overall, this film is the definition of generic, it had some potential but fails to deliver on it and there are much better action films out there.",Bloodshot

45,kirbylee70-599-526179,A DARKER SUPERHERO,8,6 June 2020,"When things get turned and twisted as they have recently people tend to seek out something that feels comfortable to them. These are times when we seek out entertainment that is familiar to us, that doesn't provide us with something outrageous or too new.Since his rise to fame with the film PITCH BLACK, actor Vin Diesel has attempted to provide fans with that comfortable certain sameness in his films. Consider that most of his biggest hits have been action films like those featuring the character of Riddick or the FAST AND FURIOUS features. These are steady action films where he plays a strong character bent on doing things his way. Now we can add BLOODSHOT to that list of characters.In BLOODSHOT, Diesel stars as U.S. Marine Ray Garrison. As the film opens he and his elite team are taking out a target in Mombasa. Once completed he goes on vacation with his wife Gina in Italy, only to be tracked down by a terrorist named Axe. Axe first kills Gina and then kills Ray as well. But that's not the end of Ray.A company called Rising Spirit Tech has developed a program that returns dead soldiers to life, giving them specific enhancements as well. CEO Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce) informs Ray that in his case his body is filled with nanite technology, microscopic robotic instruments that automatically replace damaged tissue and increase his strength. As he learns to accept the new technology he also experiences flashbacks to what happened just before his death.As these flashbacks begin to haunt him, Ray remembers enough to know that it was Axe who was responsible for Gina's death. Using the nanites in his body to hack into the company's computer system, he locates Axe in Budapest and heads out for revenge. An attack on Axe' team of bodyguards in a tunnel in Europe gives him the chance to avenge both his and Gina's death as he takes out the entire team as well as Axe.Ray returns to Rising Spirit Tech and Dr. Harting to finish out the tests they were doing. What Ray isn't aware of is that Gina was never killed. Instead these are all implanted memories put into his brain by Harting. He is using Ray to get revenge on those who got in his way with his new technology, those who might beat him to the punch with it.He reprograms Ray once more thinking the new target is responsible for Gina's death. After killing the target he focuses on a computer programmer named Wilfred Wigans (Lamorne Morris) in the house, but Wigans sets off an EMP that shuts down the nanites as well as communications with Rising Spirit Tech. Wigans tells Ray everything that's been going on as well as where Gina is now. When he shows at her house he discovers they were never married, haven't seen each other in five years and she now has a family.Determined to take down Rising Spirit Tech Ray recruits Wigans to help him along with KT (Eiza Gonzalez), another of the elite team who has become disillusioned with the motives of Harting as well. Facing off against the rest of the cyber enhanced team it's a battle to the death as Ray sets out to ensure that no other soldiers will ever be manipulated this way.Based on the Valiant comic book of the same name this character seems perfect for Diesel. He can look brooding, get into hand to hand combat, explode vehicles and create mayhem where ever he goes. Don't get me wrong. Diesel is a better actor than most realize (if you don't believe me check him out in FIND ME GUILTY). But roles like this are his bread and butter. They play to his strengths and to the types of films his fans crave. Pearce does an excellent job as well as the slimy inventor who uses his creation to do his dirty work.While I never read the comic it doesn't matter here. Perhaps that actually helps since most movies based on comics these days tend to toss out what made the comic good and reinvent them anyway. I can say that this film will provide fans that comfort they seek, Diesel in an action film that delivers on all levels. Released just as the covid-19 outbreak kicked in the movie didn't get much of a chance at the box office so who knows if it will get a sequel or not. Either way if you're looking for a fun action flick this one fills that need.",Bloodshot

48,s3276169,Unremarkable.......,6,26 March 2020,"""Bloodshot"" fails to resonate because it makes no effort to do anything new or even creative.This is a by the numbers ""Universal Soldier 1992"" knock off that's been given a cyber make over. Its not bad as such, its just been done before and to be honest, its been done, a whole lot better.This film essentially repeats itself over the course of its running time, with a slight divergence from the repetition, at the end. It tries to compensate for this by moving locales and investing in a lot of admittedly quite impressive, CGI.I suspect too, the investment in celebrity action star, in the form of Vin Diesal, was expected to make a splash. I'm not sure if its just me but celebrity means very little to me these days. Indeed, anyone with action chops, even a lesser known actor, could have taken the lead and I would not have been any more or less ambivalent.When all is said and done, a rather unremarkable action flick that's not that bad, its just not that good either.6/10.",Bloodshot
49,questl-18592,Blahshot,4,4 June 2020,"This might be one of the most generic superhero movies I've ever seen. Vin Diesel is working it but he's surrounded by mediocrity. The characters are all one dimensional, there's nothing really creative with the powers on display or the story.There could have been something here, which is sad. Wow does the trailer ruin things though, so if you missed it and have interest in this, count yourself lucky.Also, there are times the special effects are great and then times where they're just... bad. For an effects driven action movie, cutting corners on the action and the effects isn't a great decision.All in all, if this finds itself on a streaming service? Give it a go, it's inoffensive enough and Diesel is always entertaining in his way, as is Pierce. Don't pay for this though, it's not worth it.",Bloodshot
50,aidanratesmovies,Nothing new here,6,12 August 2020,"Vin Diesel's new superhero flick is nothing to be too excited about, as Bloodshot can be entertaining, but is hardly memorable in the long run. The biggest problem with the film is of course the execution. Instead of investing more time in this action flick, it feels rather rushed, and quite average at times, especially in the script department. It's hard to see such an interesting character, and the interesting concepts that follow it, go to waste in such an average and mechanically formed manor. Vin Diesel provides with usual fun grunting self in his performance as the titular character. The rest of the actors are about what you would expect from this type of film, though I did enjoy the performance of Lamorne Morris whose charisma on screen never fails to surprise me. The film can be decently entertaining at times, but sadly becomes predictable along the way, once you get into how the story is going, and does loose its traction a bit as it goes on. The special effects and CGI used in the film are undoubtedly impressive, but you can't help but wish they put more time into the writing of the film than how it looks. In the end, Bloodshot was a bit better than I expected it to be, but all in all, not anything too special. It does waste its talent a bit, as well as its interesting storyline, but for fans of Diesel and action films alike, it certainly isn't a terrible choice to watch.
My Rating: 6/10",Bloodshot
51,masonsaul,Average,5,11 March 2020,"Bloodshot is an average movie that's brought down by its extremely generic and predictable plot with nothing shocking, smart or original. Its also got some inconsistent CG and action sequences that border on being incomprehensible but are relatively enjoyable. However, Vin Diesel is great and Eiza González and Guy Pearce are both really good. Its pretty well paced and the music by Steve Jablonsky is good.",Bloodshot
52,robertemerald,"Exciting, competent",8,28 June 2020,"I'm not sure Vin Diesel should have signed up for new franchise. He's big and powerful and definitely a presence, but I'm not sure he wasn't just a few years too old for this one. Perhaps I'm bias. I was hoping for another brilliant Riddick movie. I have to say Guy Pearce is superb in this movie. There are some really cool particle effects in Bloodshot, and certainly the final action sequence is a triumph and really eye popping. Bloodshot is yet another really cool comic book transfer, and around here we are certainly really enjoying this screen revolution. Marvel have been brilliant and DC get better and better, and they are certainly not the only players in the game. It's all wicked. Bloodshot is a very worthy addition to that game.",Bloodshot

The CGI At TimesSummary:Let's get to the point at hand, you go to an action film you want the pace and effects to make your adrenaline pump right? Bloodshot does not pull any stops, dropping right into a battle scene with an explosive opening that brings plenty of what is to come. Once the story sets up after this, the movie dives into showing off some cool technological components, areas that could very well be seen in the near future given the focus. It's these technological prowess that the movie is anchored on, with much of the designs for story, development, and the action scenes all dependent on the augmentations seen. Fortunately, the movie exploits this to full effect and brings some decent action sequences to the mix, primarily during the explosive climax when all styles of fighting are brought together in a decent finale. However, the factor that really elevates this movies is all the sound and film editing that supports the CGI scenes in front of me. Explosive sound effects riddle the theater with wall shaking goodness, sound tracks of orchestra elevate the moods and adds that adrenaline rush, all while visuals are blended together beautifully. It's definitely these components that were my favorite part of the movie and I think the biggest selling point of this film. However, there are some comedic moments to help spruce things up, usually well-timed jokes or a cliched line from Vin Diesel's repertoire as the primary ammunition. This reviewer though really liked the hacker character though, whose British mannerism and comedy attitude were the biggest relief and fit very well despite being the one pinpoint of light.However, the spectacle of the film can only distract so long from the rest of the things I did not like as much in this movie. Predictability is the name of the game, thanks again due to trailers and just the linear telling this film takes. Obvious foreshadowing from dialogue and a big early scene should give more than enough away for you to realize where the movie is heading, which should allow you to enjoy the spectacle. Bloated dialogue tries to paint a more engaging story, but it does little other than provide weaker backstory and attempts at character development. Sadly, Bloodshot does not do the best job with backstories and character utilization outside of select scenes where they make a start at using them. Perhaps a little more mission use of them, meeting some better development would have helped, but where comic books have time the movies did not so they cut their losses. In terms of the action spectacle itself, the movie hit a few things that I'm not the biggest fan of. Action scenes can really use their work to emphasize violence, bashing, and that epic finishing move. However, in this movie, it gets a little overused, showing off cool portrayals of skin damage and anatomical healing, but at the same time making for boring bouts of Vin Diesel walking. Tough atmosphere it may establish, the overuse was boring at times and I would have loved a little more dynamic work. Dynamic work though does not mean having to have a camera that looks like it's in an earthquake movie, and Bloodshot has its moments where sporadic camera shifts don't bring me into the action, but rather take away from it. Finally, you will hear the CGI looks bad, and I'll agree at times it really does look fake and forced, similar to the Smith vs. Neo fight in the Matrix Reloaded. I'm guessing budget to make the action fights the most realistic got cut, but at least it moves well and has the special effects to lessen the blow. Still, given all the other impacts it was trying to make, I think Bloodborn could have used a little more polishing on this front.The VERDICT:Overall, Bloodshot is an action movie that works to pull the thrill of the 90s action back into the modern day. It's got great editing to sell the action scenes and give you those thrills, alongside a pacing that works for this genre. Amidst this technological stunt show, there are a few decent performances, and the comedic work of the Hacker character helps stir some things up amidst the constant fighting on hands. Still, the movie has an okay science fiction plot that won't leave as much on an impression, especially given bloated dialogue, limited secondary character use predictably. Sadly, the stunning editing still needed some polishing with the CGI work itself, primarily during said action moments. Still given the effects, you could probably find enough reason to check it out in theaters, but otherwise hang out for this one for a home viewing.My scores are;Action/Drama/Sci-Fi: 6.5
Movie Overall: 6.0",Bloodshot

I was pretty tired the first time, and there is a lot of alternating between whispering / hushed tones and loud gunfire.This movie does a lot of good visual action and effects, some stuff I don't think I've ever seen on screen before, it's well cast and the production value is through the roof, but I can't say that it's all that good a story.It's definitely an interesting story, but the movie seeming radically torn between being a promotion of technological power and fear mongering, and the fear mongering bit always irks me because it gets in the way of real progress because someone want to tell a story one way versus another.The majority of the movie you can see in other movies like any of the movies with Wolverine, ""Extraction"" (2020), but there are some special bits that make it stand out. I just don't feel like I care about the action that is happening. When you see someone explode a watermelon, yeah it's cool, but why are you doing it, why are you taking 2 hours to do it?This is a good one-shot, just put it in the queue for when you want to see an action flick.",Bloodshot
55,rannynm,"Unique storyline, awesome action, great stunt scenes",10,19 March 2020,"I like Bloodshot because it has a unique storyline, awesome action and great stunt scenes. This film keep your attention throughout the entire movie.Bloodshot is about a solider named Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) who gets killed in action and is brought back to life by an innovative scientist named Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce), who fixes wounded soldiers by augmenting what the soldier lost in battle. One soldier, named Jimmy Dalton (Sam Heughan), lost his legs in battle so Dr. Harting gave him robotic legs. Ray lost his life and Dr. Harting replaced all of his blood with nanites, which can rebuild any part of his injured body.My favorite part is the elevator shaft fight scene when Ray, Jimmy and Tibbs (Alex Hernandez) are fighting on top of the elevator. The digital effects are awesome, like how the nanites heal Ray every time he gets hurt. The graphics are perfect. The costumes look like army gear with special devices attached. There is some foul language and violence. The cast fits each character, especially Vin Diesel who perfectly playa Ray Garrison.The moral of this movie is that not everything is what it seems. You have to see the film in order to understand the moral.I give Bloodshot 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults.Reviewed by Ethan P., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

But are the people giving him a second chance all that they seem?I found the film to be pretty good. Not amazing, but good enough. The action sequences were ace & appealing enough. My only downer on this was the confusing story-line & of course the chemistry between the main protagonist & KT. I would've liked some romantic chemistry between the 2. Thanks to the feminist whining from Eiza Gonzales we never got this according to some article about female protagonists being seen as strong & not love interests pfft please... alright not a big deal but still, given that the actress is gorgeous as hell, I would've wanted to see that.Aside from that, the film was action packed enough. 8/10",Bloodshot
58,Abdulxoxo,Nothing we haven't seen before,6,19 January 2021,"Bloodshot is a revenge thriller with overblown CGI. It tries to be clever when our protagonist discovers information that makes him question what he's been told following his reanimation. The movie is a confusing mess; but I couldn't care enough about it to be bothered.
As for Ray Garrison, first of all it doesn't help that he was being played by Vin Diesel with his typically emotionless approach. When he is involved in fight scenes he come across as almost indestructible, which takes away any sort of tension you may have about whether he can survive these situations. The supporting performances are relatively mediocre across the board. The action is nothing remarkable as well, the use of slow motion and so many explosions didn't really add much of anything to the story or the fights. Overall, there's something in this story that could have worked with the right casting and writing. Sadly, they weren't present, but at least it's still an entertaining action flick, if nothing else.",Bloodshot
59,omendata,"Crash, Bang, Wallop Formulaic Drivel With Some Truly Awful Dialogue!",5,2 September 2020,"Not much to say about this apart from the fact it could have been any crash, bang, wallop movie made in the past few years as it has nothing new to say plot or story-wise and you will just feel you have seen it all before; it reminds me of many of the Jean Claude Van Damme smash and bash em type movies with none of Jean's impressive martial arts abilities however.Yes the CGI is good but that does not make a movie although judging by the number of 9 and 10 stars shills being paid by the produces of this movie with the usual one review under their belt seem to be desperately trying to unbalance the review rating of this movie you would wonder (no surprise there on IMDB though, it is par for the course just a shame IMDB cannot weed the false reviews out). This tedious movie should be no more than a very average 5/10, if that!You know it is bad when you start to get bored with the repetitive action and wonder ""when is it going to be all over"". I am a big fan of Vin but this does his acting portfolio no favours as it is formulaic, plotless, dumb and with some really poor acting and to add insult to injury they also have to give us the usual BLM remit and stick in a black guy as the genius computer programmer whose acting was beyond a joke and which I had to laugh at every time he spoke a line - not just his fault as the dialogue was truly atrocious beyond bad.My biggest annoyance are the silly London accents and terrible script with such awful London jungle-speak that I guess most Americans will be scratching their heads wondering what the heck the UK actors are actually saying - I am British but even I found the London jungle-speak so low brow and this just makes the movie even more crass and stupid than it actually was...oh and the ending...wow just wow - after being blown to pieces Vin miraculously survives and makes the film just look plain stupid and for this it really does deserve another star taken off to give it 4/10.",Bloodshot

This movie is basically RoboCop and Captain America without the fun factor. Sure Vin Diesel's fine in this movie but he's the only element that really shines in this tired origin story to a character that hasn't even been rebooted a bajillion times like Batman or Spider-Man. I wish this movie was stronger, but it just isn't; at least not for me.This is a cliche-fest that WAS self-aware at some point early on in the movie, but it's like the filmmakers forgot they were developing a character-driven drama and decided to settle on all the most basic superhero movie 101s imaginable WITHOUT being a parody: there's a tragic backstory, a stupid supervillain and a heartthrob who's seemingly duplicitous but not really all bad, and then you have fight scenes that are ripped straight from Venom and Captain America: The Winter Soldier.

63,Prashast_Singh,Extremely enjoyable. One of the most gorgeous action movies of the year.,10,24 March 2020,"Honestly, it's still hard to believe I could've seen this in cinemas almost a week ago had the conditions not been like what they are, and that I just watched it in HD. The moment I heard the theaters were being shut down, I had a feeling that I might have to wait for months to watch this movie, but then it hit the digital platforms today. I instantly decided to watch it, and honestly, it's one of the most beautiful action movies of the year. The action sequences, the visual effects and the rich colors are the reason I felt this should have also been in 3D, even if just for home media now.Vin Diesel embraces Ray Garrison as another action hero as he's one of the top stars in this genre and hence it's almost a cakewalk for him. Seeing him as a nearly indestructible yet at-times-vulnerable superhero was a treat. But most importantly, I have to praise the stunning visual effects and usage of colors during the action sequences. The film has a surprisingly high visual appeal, and rather so much that it does make me feel bad it couldn't enjoy a proper theatrical run.Bloodshot might seem like just another revenge-themed superhero film if you go by the one-line synopsis. But it's a lot more than that, and I was amazed by the high-concept story this film actually has. Overall, I'd recommend this to anyone who's into superheroes/comic-book based action movies. Vin Diesel fans should easily embrace this one. I really do wish to see a 3D re-release at some time in the future.",Bloodshot

67,one9eighty,Film heaven for 15 years olds... Film Hell for nearly everyone else,5,12 October 2020,"Adapted from the pages of Valiant comic's comes a 2020 blockbuster featuring Vin Diesel as the titular character ""Bloodshot"". Resurrected from death and enhanced with nanite technology to make him and unstoppable hybrid of man and machine, this Bloodshot film is an origin story, telling how a dead soldier was brought back to life and turned into something his enemies should definitely fear.After returning from a conflict, Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) is enjoying life with his wife in Italy. One day trouble comes knocking and kidnaps him and his wife. When he awakens and realises, he has been held captive it soon transpires that his captors want information that he just cannot give them. To try and make him talk they kill his wife, and then him. He awakes to find that he has very little memory of his past life, but he is different, he's enhanced with nanites thanks to Rising Spirit Technology company and their leader Dr Emil Harting (Guy Pearce). As he comes to terms with his new surroundings and the people, he now shares a living area with, memories come flooding back. Ignoring the pleas of fellow enhancee, KT, he goes in search of the people that killed his wife and killed him. He thinks that getting revenge will be the end of things, but little does he know that this is not the first time he has gone looking for revenge, and it will not be the last time either.Dave Wilson steps into the directors' chair for this film, and while it is his first major motion picture as director, he does have experience in the in the entertainment industry, but mainly in visual effects in video games. Jeff Wadlow wrote this story for this film and then adapted it to a screenplay alongside Eric Heisserer. With a runtime of 109 minutes this 12A rated film is an adaption of Valiant comics ""Bloodshot"" (by Kevin VanHook, Don Perlin and Bob Layton) which was released in 1992, and then rebooted in 1997, and then rebooted again in 2012. The film retains some of the original content, particularly characters, but minor details were changed including the change of Project Rising Sun changing to Rising Spirit Technology. The 12A-rating mainly accounts for the action, fighting and occasional gore.Vin Diesel leads the cast as Garrison/ Bloodshot, in a role which does not need him to exercise much of an emotional range, and to be fair he does OK without really excelling. Eiza Gonzalez plays KT, a former US Navy diver, who Garrison strikes up a friendship with. She is okay and seems to be torn between following orders and doing what is right. Jimmy Dalton is played by Sam Heughan who dislikes Garrison but also comes across as moody and uncompassionate. Alex Hernandez plays Marcus Tibbs, who is mostly quiet. The four of them are under the watchful eye of Guy Pearce as Dr Emil Harting - a corrupt megalomaniac with a hidden agenda. This isn't the first time I've seen Pearce in a role like this and it feels at time like he's not a million miles away from the to role he played in ""Iron Man 3"" (2013). Along the way Lamone Morris appears as Wilfred Wigans who helps Garrison out.While it is an origin movie, the whole concept was not all that original, and I was reminded of lots of other films in the set-up, the plot, and the outcomes. It was a modern ""RoboCop"" crossed with ""Universal Soldier"", crossed with half a dozen modern comic book films. It did have some decent action going for it, but as a caveat it also had lots and lots of CGI too. The characters did have a development arc, but they were not any richer for the plot that took them to their end point - the only character that grows because of their actions is Gonzalez as KT. The pacing of the film felt a little off, some scenes seemed to be spliced together for the purpose of delivering a pacey movie, but then a little common sense would tell you that it should take more than a few lines of dialogue from Dr Harting before Bloodshot is able to a) find a plane, b) steal it, and c) fly it to London - which FTR was clearly NOT London or anywhere in the UK. What was supposed to be London did not look like England at all, the sun was out, the streets were all wrong, they were driving on the wrong side of the road, the registration plates were not British plates. Other goofs include KT being able to speak at all (if a mechanical enhancement is helping her breath by bypassing her throat, how would her vocal chords work?)... the flour tunnel would have exploded - I learned how combustible flour was in high school... I digress.For all it is flaws, and there are few of them, what you have here is an action comic film that does not need much of a brain to understand. It will satisfy the desensitized masses who just want pretty pictures and lots of bullets and explosions. If you want something that is clever or has an original and engaging plot, then perhaps try something different. Made with a budget of $45 million, which I suspect mainly went on the effects and visuals, I can understand why it only grossed $37.3 million. Yes, it was released during a global pandemic, but I cannot seriously believe that was the only reason it did not become a box office smash - average to ok, but never brilliant.",Bloodshot

69,RforFilm,"Bloodshot might be a way to kill two hours, but for a story about new technology, it feels like a dated 2010's movie",5,16 March 2020,"Who knows what nanotechnology is? For the uneducated, nanotechnology is the use of robots that are miniature size. While I can see something like this used is the future for medicine and business, we are still a while from that kind of tech. I could potentially see the use of nanotechnology to help redirect cells in bodies to heal parts of it faster, and maybe even to areas not originally accessible. Would something like this suddenly find Band-Aid companies out of business? Maybe, but it'll depend of what kind of medical advancements they can do with this.Today's movie takes that kind of healing to turn someone into a superhero. In someway, that's got to make them of the most powerful of all. After all, no matter what ones power is and no matter how strong they are, if injured, they still need to heal. Unless of course your Wolverine or Deadpool and don't need to rest to heal. A story can still create tension with that if they can get to someone they care about. Again, body healing is different then mental healing. So let's see what nanotechnology can do for an action movie in Bloodshot.US Marine Ray Garrison (played by Vin Diesel) leads a successful mission in stopping a terrorist group and saves the life of a fellow solider. He also returns home to his wife Gina to live a nice life on the coast of Italy. That happiness of short lived as mercenaries kidnap them both and demand to know how they uncovered the terrorist location. With no answer, they kill Gina and him. But rather then dying, Ray wakes up in a laboratory. This turns out to be a company called Rising Spirit Tech who builds optics and cybernetic enhancements for disabled US military.The companies CEO, Dr. Emil Haring (played by Guy Pearce) tells Ray that his body is now filled with nanite tech that allows for instant healing. The catch is that he now needs constant reprograming and refueling of nanites. He used his new powers to leave to hunt the men down responsible for killing his wife. He tracks them to Budapest and manages to take them out, but when he returns to the company, he understands that if they can reprogram him, then how much of his memories are true? Were the men the real men? Is his wife still alive? Were his Marine missions real?A movie like Bloodshot feels like the kind of action film I'd see on Netflix; a passable one that serves to kill some time. Is it a bad movie? I can't say so as it can be entertaining. Vin Diesel is an actor that I don't see much as an actor, but a lot like John Wayne, does great at playing himself. He's charismatic, charming, and you even get a sense of his pain when he realizes that everything about his old life is gone. I'm surprised that with the exception of Groot, he hasn't had the chance to play a superhero.But a hero is only as good as the story. I'm aware that Bloodshot is based off a comic so I don't know how close it is, but it feels...like something from fifteen years ago. This isn't much of a spoiler, but this is another movie where the people who gave him the technology are also the villain. We've seen this done several times (even within the MCU from Disney), so I don't know why Hollywood keeps thinking this is an original concept. My guess is that the story was originally done when this was still inventive.I might have been more on board had they cut away from that plotline. Its because the first half of the movie is actually a lot of fun. The tunnel fight, though it can get carried away with the shaky cam, was something that made me glad I saw it. But the second half needed a rewrite? Why couldn't the story had explored the heroes relationship with the military? Or what about questioning how much of his memories are false? Or that there are several people in the military with instant healing? There's a lot of territory that could have been covered.I'll give this five blood bots out of ten. Except for the tunnel fight and Vin Diesel, I doubt I'll remember much of Bloodshot. It might be an alright way to kill two hours on a rainy day at home, but that's about it. For a movie that tries to push some new technology, it feels kind of dated.",Bloodshot

71,bankofmarquis,"""Funner"" than I expected",7,8 May 2020,"BLOODSHOT was one of those movies that I was going to ""get around to see, sometime"" before it left the movie theaters, little did I know that I would leave the movie theaters before Bloodshot did. So, when I ran across it On-Demand at home, I figured I would check it out - probably to let it run in the background as I multi-tasked.Well...a funny thing happened while multi-tasking while watching this film. I found myself NOT multi-tasking, but rather, I stopped to focus on the film, for I was being entertained by the events unfolding before me on my screen.Based on the Valiant comic of the same name, BLOODSHOT tells the tale of Ray Garrison a slain soldier who is brought back to life with nano-technology - technology that allows him to be used as a tool by Dr. Emil Harting.Vin Diesel is the perfect blunt instrument to play Bloodshot. He reeks of testosterone and macho-ness but is a winning personality on the screen with enough charm and charisma to draw the audience in. Ably aiding him is Eiza Gonzalez (BABY DRIVER) as KT - another experiment/tool of Dr. Harting's - their relationship is the heart of this movie and it there is ""enough"" chemistry between the two to make me care about them. The revelation for me in this film is Lamorne Morris (GAME NIGHT) as Wilfred Wigans - a rival hacker who is an enemy (or is he a friend) of Bloodshot. I loved the fun that Wigans brought to the role and the film - he knew what kind of movie he was in and just ""ran with it"".Everyone else in this film is pretty ""generic"" - especially (to my disappointment) Guy Pearce as Dr. Harting. I needed him to be less contained and more broad for this type of comic book film. I read that Michael Sheen was slated to play this role but had to drop out at the last moment due to scheduling conflicts. I would have loved to have seen ""wild. out of control Michael Sheen"" in this role.The direction by David Wilson - in his major motion picture debut - is ""serviceable"", his direction doesn't get in the way. He is a former Visual Effects Supervisor and it shows in this film for it is at it's best when the VFX takes center stage (especially in the fight/action scenes). The key to Bloodshot is that he cannot be killed by conventional means for the nano-bots in his blood stream will reform immediately. So, you get quite a few slow-motion shots of bullets piercing through various parts of Bloodshot's body (with nano-bots flying out) only to have the nano-bots stop their flight away from the body and return to reform the shape of the particular body part (mostly, Bloodshot's head). In lesser hands, this could be an annoying trick, but it worked for me here.The script and secondary characters and the plot is mostly throwaway in this film - clearly we are here for the fight scenes and the VFX - and if you set your expectations correctly, you will be entertained by this film.I know I was - to my surprise.Letter Grade: B7 Stars (out of 10) - and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)",Bloodshot

This film falls into that category, and it's very much an updated version of those old movies, especially the Cannon studio films.Vin Diesel is the lead cyborg human out for revenge but finds he's being manipulated and so on. Don't worry any further about the storyline. He's the perfect lead for this, although others like Jason Statham or the Rock etc could have fitted in.The special effects are very good and Guy Pearce is an excellent villain.BUT that's as far as it goes, there's little more else to give credit for this film. A long time ago, this might have been seen as ground breaking, but it's now very derivative, another Terminator like homage.It's a fine action movie for a night where you want to kick up your feet and switch off your brain, just don't expect too much more.

There is little to no back story of the character, no heart and depth to any of the scenes. The love story is very blurry and feels completely unnecessary. The lines are cheesy and the scenes with Guy Pearce made me cringe. Vin diesel is a fantastic actor, especially on Riddick and fast and the furious, but he was greatly down graded in this film. I wish he could take a role in a movie s an actual super hero. I think he would make a good super hero or villain. Perhaps if they made a part two it would have much more potential then the first if they could give a back story to Bloodshot and we could see him use his ability for good as a vigilantly.

80,kjproulx,"A Big, Fun Guilty Pleasure",6,27 March 2020,"When it comes to schlocky cinema, there are times when it works for me and times when it really doesn't, just like every moviegoer. When I find a film that does work but is admittedly not all that great, I have more fun watching it than I should. Bloodshot was the most recent film to be released that I felt this way towards. So, even though I may talk pretty highly about some aspects, don't let that make you believe it's a great movie, because it's absolutely not. Here's why, with your own discretion, you should check this one out.After Ray Garrison witnesses the murder of his significant other and is then killed himself in the heat of combat, he is then reborn by an organization that has replaced his blood with nanites. These living things/robots work as his blood and allow him to regenerate any wounds, within reason. This also gives him agility and strength, pretty much making him a superhero. Finding out there is much more to this organization than he originally was led to believe, a pretty fun action flick begins to unfold. Although none of the actors/actresses here are giving award-worthy performances, I think it was this assembled cast that made me like this movie as much as I did.Vin Diesel has never been one of the greatest actors in the world, but I've always enjoyed watching him on-screen. His back and forth here with Eiza Gonzalez was likeable and it's probably the best performances I've seen from her so far. It's never a bad thing to add Guy Pearce to your film either, but I'm starting to feel like he is being given incredibly familiar roles every time he is cast. I haven't seen him in anything different from this since his role in Iron Man 3 back in 2013, aside from maybe The Rover.Now, here's where audiences will know whether or not they will want to check this film out if you already didn't. Bloodshot absolutely takes itself seriously, so if you're looking for a self-aware movie that warrants it's schlock, I would say you're in the wrong place. There are moments that had me engaged and others that had me rolling my eyes, but it all worked together as a piece of filmmaking that is forgettable, but also one that I will probably watch one or two more times when I can't find anything else to watch. There's nothing Shakespearean here, but if cool visual effects, a good enough premise, and an overdone conclusion doesn't bother you too much, I feel that this is something you can check out.In the end, I kind of knew what I was getting myself into, simply due to the fact that it was directed by Dave Wilson. Having done the visual effects work for movies like Avengers: Age of Ultron and video games like Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, without ever having directed anything outside of one short film, I expected a little more style over substance. While Bloodshot definitely fits that description, I just had a lot of fun watching it. This movie certainly won't please everyone, but there are far worse action movies out there. In the years to come, I will probably look back on Bloodshot and call it one of my favourite guilty pleasures.",Bloodshot
81,kuarinofu,Wasted potential,5,25 March 2020,"This film could've been greatly improved, but it looks like they knew what they were doing.This looks very calculated and ""producery"".Firstly, the script needed some serious work. The premise was simple but still interesting and emotional, some good writing could've been done there, but again, they didn't bother.Secondly, even the weak and overall lacking emotional background of Diesel's character was destroyed by his attitude. He didn't care one bit. He absolutely cannot act or show any relatable emotion. He can look menacing and scream, that's about it.Thirdly, the action and the overabundance of slow-mo made this film look like it was made in the early 2000s (I explain this in the end).And finally, this film felt like they perfectly knew what they were doing. The budget is very low for an action film, Diesel was their big ""star"" because some people still remember him mostly due to F&F presence (especially for foreign markets, since Diesel is worldwide famous). The CGI was cheap and rubbery (since it was supposedly made by a game cinematic studio, and for game production this is sufficient), the characters are not there, just cardboard cut-outs: a generic ""bad guy"" set of cliches, a generic good-looking woman character (the actress was good though), some random guy nobody remembers and the wisecracking techie. Bloodshot is also not a character in this. All emotional scenes are destroyed by horrible writing and Diesel's attitude.The producers took a calculated risk, and I'm sure that it will work in their favor in the end.As for the film itself, I think that such a story can be written well for the screen and be emotionally engaging. But not now and not in this case.One more thing. I often play videogames and at some point, the film started to feel like a videogame cutscene, and guess what? This is what the director does.

85,msbreviews,"Vin Diesel might be awful as Bloodshot, but the action is even worse...",3,2 April 2020,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)First of all, no. I've never read the comic book, so I didn't know a single thing about the superhero Bloodshot going in. What I did know was that Jeff Wadlow was in command of the screenplay, and we all know how extremely horrible his latest movies are (Truth or Dare, Fantasy Island). Add Vin Diesel as the protagonist and a first-time director (David S. F. Wilson), it's impossible to have high expectations for such a film, no matter how good the source material is. Maybe it could surprise me and end up being a reasonably decent flick...It didn't. Bloodshot is even worse than I expected. I genuinely thought that the action would be the movie's savior. I didn't watch any trailers, as usual, but I did see an image here and there of that red smoke, as well as a couple of glances at the regenerating CGI. Honestly, it's the most disappointing aspect of the whole film. Simply because it's the only thing I was expecting to be decent, at least. The ""final battle"" has some of the worst CGI of the century, and it goes on for way too long. There's an abundance of shaky-cam, the editing is truly awful at times, a lot of action sequences are barely understandable, and even the slow-motion is overused.However, the reason why the movie ultimately fails is, once again, due to Wadlow's screenplay (which he co-wrote with Eric Heisserer, but Wadlow is the main one). As always, his narrative is a total mess. Confusing, lacks creativity, raises tons of logical questions, and the real past of Ray Garrison is empty of any explanation. The ending is not only predictable and formulaic, but it also generates even more questions, leaving the viewer frustrated with so many unanswered plot points. David Leitch and Chad Stahelski (both have Deadpool and John Wick in their filmography) left the project right after being hired as the directors... I wonder why?!The first minutes are probably the best of the entire runtime. I mean, excluding a not-sexy-at-all scene featuring Vin Diesel and Talulah Riley (Gina Garrison). That was cringe-worthy. Nevertheless, the story's concept is really captivating, to say the least (or the comic book wouldn't have its remarkable success). It's one of those action flicks that could easily turn into a successful franchise if the people involved in the project are more talented. With this, I transition to another of my main issues: Vin Diesel.Very rarely, I negatively criticize an actor's performance. I admit that I'm easily pleased by any cast. If you ask me ""what's an actor/actress you don't like?"", I would probably be stuck for an answer. Diesel's display is so emotionless that even someone like me can be affected by it. Besides being a rock throughout the whole film, Diesel has this weird habit of TALKING VERY LOUD AND CLEAR, only to instantly lower his volume so much that he's almost whispering. He does this consecutively and repeatedly in almost every dialogue.There's no care for developing a single character, not even the protagonist. Everyone is just a stereotype of some secondary action character: the funny IT guy, the hot girl who develops feelings for the hero, the male teammate who gets jealous that his alpha territory gets invaded, and the ""motivation-less bad guy who's made look like a good guy in the beginning, but we all know who he truly is""... Literally, the two most talented actors (Toby Kebbell and Talulah Riley) are the ones with the least amount of screentime.In the end, Bloodshot is even worse than I expected. The messy, formulaic, and logically questionable screenplay by Jeff Wadlow and Eric Heisserer is the worst aspect of the movie, but the action is undoubtedly the most disappointing one. The ""final fight"" is one of the worst CGI sequences of the century, and the action throughout the runtime is filled with an uncontrollable shaky-cam, an excess of slow-motion, and some poor editing, making most of these scenes incredibly hard to follow. Vin Diesel delivers as much emotion as a rock, and while the rest of the cast is fine, the characters follow every single stereotype ever written for an action flick. It also doesn't help to put a first-time director in charge of the whole thing, but David S. F. Wilson is far from being the one to blame. Occasionally good action moments and a great concept just barely keep the film breathing. It's one of the worst movies of the year.Rating: D",Bloodshot

87,SoumikBanerjee25,Mediocrity at its best!,4,12 June 2020,"Vin Diesel starrer 'Bloodshot' is All for style and show but nothing for substance. Based upon Valiant Comics' most famous character ; it fails to impress on its first showing. Mainly due to Its execution and writing that hugely lacks a ""Woomph"" factor.
The concept, itself was intriguing enough. Comprising a resurrected man with special powers and abilities; this one was bound to be good. Saddening to see such a Promising premise couldn't be fulfilled at the end. Dave Wilson's directorial solely focuses on glamour and visual effects but forgets the other important aspects. Screenplay is not upto the mark, the same goes for the Dialogues; Badly written and similarly Performed as well. Acting looks lame from all the ensembled cast. Especially Vin Diesel who obviously doesn't have an Wider Array of Emotional range to express at first hand; as usual failed to capitalise on such powerful comic character. Elza Gonzalez looks pretty but that's just about it! Guy Pearce who played Dr. Harting has been a waste too.
For the technicalities, except the Action Pieces and Sound Score everything faltered. Although at times the action pieces too felt overly quick in succession without any proper reason. Abundance of shaky footage didn't help much either. So now the question arises! Would I recommend it? Well that heavily depends.

90,MrDHWong,"A bland, paint-by-the-numbers attempt at starting a cinematic universe for a lesser known comic book company",4,4 June 2020,"Bloodshot is a sci-fi action film based on the superhero comic series of the same name. Starring Vin Diesel in the title role, it is a bland, paint-by-the-numbers attempt at starting a cinematic universe for a lesser known comic book company.After he is killed in battle, elite soldier Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) is brought back to life by the Rising Spirit Tech (RST) company with the help of advanced nanorobotic technology. Thanks to his newly acquired nanite powers, Ray now has superhuman strength and accelerated healing, essentially turning him into the perfect soldier. Plagued by memories of his wife's death at the hands of a dangerous mercenary, Ray escapes from the RST lab to hunt him down and swiftly enact his revenge.Save for a few scenes near the end, Bloodshot is so poorly paced, repetitive, and surprisingly boring that it amazes me that the filmmakers legitimately thought that they could create a whole cinematic universe out of it. There is hardly anything in this film that hasn't been done before in the action thrillers of several years (and even decades) past. The main character is good at what he does, he loves his wife, his wife dies, he is put out of commission, he comes back, he swears revenge on the perpetrator. Rinse and repeat. This would have fared much better had it come out ten to twenty years ago but today it just feels like lazy filmmaking, especially when watched during this golden age of comic book movies.I haven't read the original Bloodshot comic from which this was based on, but that shouldn't really matter considering how much it seemingly has going for it. The whole concept of nanotechnology is becoming more and more a reality, so had this idea been handled better, we could have been treated to an interesting commentary on how human beings are adapting this into our lives. Instead, the film goes for the cliched approach to our hero using this innovation to blow up cars and fight hand-to-hand combat against the bad guys. Granted, the military implications are probably the first and most obvious things that such a technological marvel would be applied to, but it's all handled in such a clumsy, surface-level manner that it never truly leaves any long lasting impression. I'm not saying I expected this film to be some kind of sophisticated piece of art that dissects the notions of man versus machine but I at least hoped for something along the lines of this as a means of finding a redeeming trait. No such luck I'm afraid.Vin Diesel once again plays his stoic one-man-army action hero self, saying little and kicking plenty of ass whenever he needs to. He keeps the film watchable whenever he is on-screen, despite his character being relatively one-dimensional. A good amount of his actions are shown on the computer screen he is being tracked on and most of the injuries he sustains are merely implied, robbing the film of any tension the audience should be feeling. The rest of the cast are highly forgettable. Aside from Guy Pearce, every other actor was just there to either spout exposition or show up later on for a contrived action scene. It doesn't give the audience much reason to care about what is happening in the story if the characters aren't interesting enough to hold one's attention.In the end, I just don't see how this whole thing could work as a cinematic franchise. It simply fails to establish a firm foundation from where it can stand alongside other better cinematic universes like Marvel and even Vin Diesel's own Fast and Furious series. Considering how poorly the film has done at the box office (although most of this is due to the COVID-19 pandemic), it is unlikely there will be a sequel any time soon, which comes as a bittersweet relief to someone like me.I rate it 4/10",Bloodshot

However, the biggest star of this film wasn't Vin but VFX, it was a particle-physics showcase. There's a decent enough sci-fi angle to this so it's a good film across several dimensions.

96,trinaboice,Robotic soldier turns into...robotic soldier with nanotechnology,5,11 March 2020,"IN A NUTSHELL:
Columbia Pictures offers a science-fiction drama based on the popular Valiant comic book Bloodshot (2019) Book 1. I wasn't familiar with the comic book character, but I always get a kick out of Vin Diesel and was ready for a fun popcorn flick. ""Welcome to the circus"" says one of the wounded/enhanced warriors when Ray Garrison joins the super-human squad of medically-enhanced bio soldiers. Cue the popcorn. Most people are calling this a ""one and done"", meaning it's entertaining enough to watch it once but it won't be anything people will want to watch over and over again.TIPS FOR PARENTS:
Lots of violence with various weapons, as well as hand-to-hand combat.
Some scenes of blood. No surprise considering the title of the film, right?
You see a married couple in bed and a side view from the topless wife.
Lots of destruction of property.
High body count.
Some sexual references in conversation.
Reference to Trojan Horse strategy that kids may not understand.
Disregard for human life.
Some profanity.THINGS I LIKED:
If you're a Vin Diesel fan, you'll enjoy his performance and all the action that usually accompanies the movies he's in.
The first time I remember seeing Guy Pearce was in the movie The Count Of Monte Cristo I thought he was excellent in that film and I've enjoyed every performance I've ever seen him in since. I was happy to see him in this too, although much of his talent was wasted.
Eiza Gonzalez is tough and sexy. She first caught my attention in Baby Driver. I love that quirky, musically-entertaining action movie. She mostly makes out with Jon Hamm in that movie, but has a lot more to do in this one.
Some cool slow-motion Michael Bay action sequences. Some people think that's super cliche but I really liked it.
You get to travel to several locations around the world.
Socks with sandals. Ha ha The musical sequence with Toby Kebbell's character was pretty entertaining.
Act 1 is very serious, but the humor kicks in about halfway through the movie and really changes the tone of the film from a drama to an entertaining superhero flick.
I was impressed by Lamorne Morris' British accent. He first came on to my radar as a funnyman American in the popular TV sitcom New Girl: Season 1. Did you know he studied acting on a Chris Farley Memorial Scholarship? That's cool that such a scholarship even exists!
The movie is directed by David Wilson. He actually does a pretty good job mixing full-on action with scenes of computer nerds typing furiously.THINGS I DIDN'T LIKE:
There are some serious plot holes in the story. I'm sure things would have made more sense to me if I had read the comic books.
A lot of things about Vin Diesel's character are simply not explained, like why does he glow? Did I miss an explanation?
The villain played by Toby Kebbell turns into a pansy within minutes of fire power. I think he looks a lot like Enrique Iglesias. What do you think?
Other than some twists, there are some predictable tropes.
Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel's character) is pretty robotic to begin with, so adding nanotechnology to his blood doesn't really change his personality in an interesting way.
We never quite understand what everyone's motivations are. We are never given much backstory on the characters, so they're all fairly one dimensional.
Avoid watching the trailer if you can since it reveals much of the story.

Vin Diesel gives such an amazing and riveting performance in film i liked this superhero character he play's then him playing Groot from Guardians of Galaxy this something different superhero he is playing. Eiza González Was A Joy able it's not just that she steals the movie herperformance her character was unbelievable it's like you like her not because she is cute hottest Mexican chick who have walked threw this earth, she was a joyable, phenomenal and pentrol she brought in potential in film but she did great in flick i feel like their should be a movie about her character of her own movie. i thought this film could been a little better but i know Vin Diesel could do a lot better then this if he was a producer i know this is a cliche action
routine i am pretty much alone in this movie because i really liked it i don't get the Negative reviews of this movie is it because the trailer showed too much the trailer must made a lot people hate it, but for me i liked or either the die hard fans of Bloodshot didn't like the look of character didn't look of it i have no ideas and never will understand with the negative reviews like what do they know? but for me it was enjoyableand yes this review has spoilersplot was Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) a slain soldier who fights in his own in war he goes home he meets with his loved wife Gina Garrison (Talulah Riley) they were in vocation of they live in Italy his wife got kidnapped and he got kidnapped then they shot his wife they shot him. Ray is brought back to life by a team of scientists. Enhanced with nanotechnology Dr Emil Harting
(Guy Pearce) is like boss of his own company but it's serectly classfiled their deaths classified as ""missing in action"" just like Universal Solider you have Katie/KT (Eiza González) known for From Dusk Till Dawn TV Series, Baby Driver, Alita: Battle Angel, a spin off Fast and Furious Hobbs & Shaw now with this i reckon this is her best role she has but will see her more in movie roles but with her role in this film she was a swimmer but she died in drowning in war but i had feelings for her character she was a interesting character like you say i want to get to know her often. Jimmy Dalton (Sam Heughan) is another marine who died in war who ended up with big giant arms on his back witch it looks cool. Tibbs (Alexander Hernandez) who got his legs blown off inAfghanistan so specialty you have soldiers who died from war then scientist brings them back to life just like another version of Universal Soldier but a lot more different in it like they are in under control like Emil is watching them wherever they go just like Universal Soldier like they controlling him. i thought action scenes were decent i loved at tunnel scene, loved all action scenes it was fun not lame or boring all in one take, fight scenes were great between Bloodshot and Jimmy Dalton with his 2 big arms. in this film i wished it could off been a different director this should have went with R RATED because title and material and source with character what he is the movie should been R RATED i mean look at every another Superhero comic book movies like Deadpool first 2, Joker got success a big one, Logan, Netflix Marvel, Punisher this should have been R RATED this could off got a huge success. once again when Bloodshot got shot blown off he repairs quickly his skin rips out and bloodshot repairs himself why would not be R RATED if this was R RATED it would have been a lot better if its R RATED it would been a better material
i mean look it's called Bloodshot so this could been a R RATED it could gone to that material just like with Netflix Marvel, Punisher, Deadpool, Logan, Joker got success R RATED but what made them change their mind to turned this in
PG-13 ?? that sucked but it didn't put me out of movie. i wished trailer didn't spoil it for everyone it didn't spoil for me but i expect this movie to be R RATED that got more of success nowadays comic books movies doesn't matter if it's PG-13 or R RATED it needs better source Material and it depends on character this is not a friendly type character like with Joker or Deadpool, Logan and Punisher got successful same goes wit this because i already i am tried of PG-13 superhero movies i want more R RATED superhero movies this should have been a that type of movie who knows? if this was R RATED could off got more success, but just because nowadays PG-13 doesn't mean it will get a success always believe nowadays comic book movies doesn't matter the Rating look at Punisher, Logan, Deadpool, Joker, Netflix Marvel shows those got massive success in box office those weren't flops people say if comic book movies get R RATED it will flop well now they are wrong. i love this movie it was watchable, it was fun this is something i would buy something out from store and yes box office is not in successful is because that coronavirus is around but in theater that's why their weren't many people in theater but give this a watch whenever you can give it a shot it's a fun movie",Bloodshot

105,akcenat,Popcorn and derivative action sci-fi flick (based on comic book),5,6 June 2020,"""Bloodshot"" isn't the worst - based on comic-book - movie but its small-scale superhero idea resembles a lot on ""Total Recall"". Its (corniness) script is poorly written and that's why film after ~45 minutes becomes boring and repetitive with most of the characters being pretty much one-dimensional and bland. Why is 'Dalton' (Sam Heughan) so sadistic and hate 'Ray' (Vin Diesel) with a burning passion we don't have the foggiest clue. Actually, not even the main character 'Ray' has a proper backstory, not to mention that his quest for vengeance at times seems almost comical. Yet the film-making of the action scenes is brisk giving enough of a sense of energy and speed-ramped dazzle to approximate excitement. Ultimately, ""Bloodshot"" isn't trying to be more than mindless entertainment that wants to awe the viewers with its special effects. All shortcomings aside, ""Bloodshot"" will be enjoyment for Vin Diesel hardcore fans, but this one didn't wow me - it just felt very generic (revenge) thriller and not memorable at all.Rating: 5 (out of 10 - average)",Bloodshot
106,stevenrotherforth,File it under 'Watch when you're drunk!',6,3 April 2020,"BloodshotThis latest vehicle for Vin Diesel doesn't require him to jump a vehicle from one skyscraper to another.
That said it's no more grounded in reality as Diesel plays Ray Garrison a soldier who along with his wife are murdered.
Garrison is resurrected and turned into a living weapon.
His blood is infused with nanotechnology that give him super strength and the ability to heal rapidly.
He then sets off on a quest to bring his murderers to justice.'Bloodshot' has gained some pretty awful reviews since its release and due to the ongoing crisis sweeping the globe this film has made its way on to home media rather prematurely.
This movie isn't nearly as bad as the horrible reviews suggest.
That said it's no masterpiece either!
But if your in lockdown or self isolating then to pass the boredom you're probably intoxicated with alcohol. This helps make this movie perfectly watchable and more to the point, it helps make this movie enjoyable.
Whilst 'Bloodshot' may have had a limited run at the box office, many will probably flock to see this in the comfort of their own home whilst sampling a few beers.
It is that kind of movie.2020's guilty pleasure.
The CGI is mostly lifted straight out of the nineties.
The elevator shaft scene could have been from
'The Matrix Reloaded' or any PS2 game.
Still there is some nicely staged action scenes.
The tunnel set piece looks wonderful with HDR allowing the oversaturated colour palette to pop.
Black levels are inky. This is a movie made for OLED.
Sound quality has real oomph. Punches and gunshots have authority making for an entertaining surround sound experience.Diesel plays himself as usual and whilst it maybe sad that he's never capitalised on a once promising acting career.
By that I mean he's pretty much type cast himself in these kind of roles.
He should be the perfect fit for this movie.
His biceps maybe getting a work out but his acting chops are starting to look a little flabby.
The strenuous dialogue is spewed out even more bluntly by Diesel's monotone delivery.
None of what he says feels believable or heartfelt.
Even when he's grieving over his slain wife.Support comes from Guy Pierce who's just dialling it in as the generic and cliched villain. There's eye candy in the beautiful form
of Eiza Gonzalez and comic relief from Lamorne Morris. In fact it is Morris that steals the show and is the most memorable from a cast of truly forgettable characters.I can't say I didn't enjoy'Bloodshot'.

107,TwistedContent,"Hey, It Entertains",5,25 March 2020,"Diesel-powered ""Bloodshot"" sure delivers on an elementary level - has just enough to offer to successfully float around in the pool of other mediocre action blockbusters. Feast your eyes with cgi battles, loads of slow-mo', the ever amusing Vin Diesel and all the rest, worked out in a classically generic and predictable Hollywood fashion & throughout the movie daydream about how it at least could've been a bit better if they did it in R.""Bloodshot's"" first five minutes were alarmingly upsetting, but, thankfully, the entertainment got improved. Vin Diesel slashes his way through a script that seems to think it has tweaked the usual formula and is also happily self-aware. Well, that's not exactly the case. Most turns, big or small, can be smelled before they are cooked, the characters, for the most part, are also card-board like. So down the mill we run and before the credits start rolling, ""Bloodshot"" shows us a painfully uninspired and whack ending that's so typical it hurts. So what's good? For starters, Vin Diesel. Personally, lately I can rarely take the man seriously, but it doesn't lead to dissatisfaction, but instead to warm and pleasant laughs. It could've been worse. The rest of the cast keeps up, but what a shame Guy Peare had little to nothing cool to do. Action is, of course, one of ""Bloodshot's"" main attractions - the cgi is actually pretty good, slow-mo fans will cream their pants, editing feels like an overkill at times, but all in all it will entertain. You can probably imagine the pacing's not exactly adrenaline inducing, but it isn't a bore either. Really, besides a few visually cool scenes, ""Bloodshot"" is a mediocrity in every department.Sadly, there isn't a whole lot to talk about here. Pick any median superhero or thriller movie and chances are it's a lot like ""Bloodshot"". Filmmakers behind this have failed to bring anything new to an already overcrowded platform, as a result, ""Bloodshot"" slowly but surely sinks below the masses.

Bloodshot is a really bad Hollywood blockbuster movie, and that's the thing, Bloodshot knows it's terrible; with the cliches and cringey acting. I honestly enjoyed this mess of a film; it has everything that makes an action movie entertaining. The cliched tough guy protagonist, the evil corporation, and superheroes.If I had to mention the worst part about Bloodshot, it would be about how cringe this movie can truly be. I don't care what movie it is, but cringe is never a good thing, especially when it's packed to the brim. Vin Diesel is the main culprit, the dude just rips with cringe. And at times it can be a little funny, because who doesn't like to laugh at actors acting.Bloodshot relies heavily on the CGI too, like most of the film is computer generated, but what's impressive is that Bloodshot had a budget of 45 million, and although the CGI was bad at times, it still is impressive. And I think at times they went a little too much on the effects, but at the end of the day, Bloodshot isn't trying to win any Oscars.If you haven't seen this movie yet, then I don't know what to say. I wouldn't recommend it at first because of how terrible and cringe it is, but then I'd recommend it because of how terrible and cringe it is. Its flaws is what makes the movie actually watchable.

Director: Dave Wilson
Starring: Vin Diesel, Eiza Gonzalez, Sam Heughan, Toby Kebbel, Talulah Riley, Guy Pearce etcOverall rating 87/100Bloodshot is based off soldier Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) Who suddenly dies in action. But is mysteriously bought back by a company that have edited his memories for him to serve them. But will he be there sheep forever or learn how to escape? I had a really fun time with Bloodshot, I had a few issues with it but largely it really worked as an action/sci fi epic that bought out the strengths from its lead actor.Firstly, the premise itself is interesting and the films set pieces and cinematography/visual creativity. The whole idea of someone dying and being bought back but genetically modified is really interesting and was executed in a really fun way in Bloodshot that was mostly new and refreshing. All the films shooting locations were beautiful as well, with a variety of different sets that allowed for interestingly set up action sequences and scenes for dialogue to take place in. I also have to applaud the films cinematography and visual creativity. Some of the film's shots were beautiful and creative, The usage of the colour red when Bloodshot was using his powers was really interesting and made his action sequences a lot of fun to watch.Next the film had great character background and secondary characters. I appreciated the amount of time throughout that they took on Vin Diesel and establishing what his life was like before he was genetically changed. It really made you understand his character and raise the stakes of breaking free from the villains therefore making you connect to his character more. The film also did a good job at having likeable secondary character that helped or went against Vin Diesel's character. It happens with a lot of movies where they spend all their time establishing their main characters and the other secondary characters are often either forgotten about or have no depth to them whatsoever, But in this films case they managed to get the secondary characters right with the character played by Eiza Gonzalez being a fantastic companion for Bloodshot, her action sequences were great and her reasoning for wanting to escape from the villains was good and made you connect to her character as well. Even the villains helping the main antagonist were great, had interesting powers and great action sequences.Expanding from my previous point the films usage of powers and technology was really cool and the action sequences were great. The film did a really good job at going into detail about the different powers and abilities that all the characters had with a good amount of screen time within the action sequences for them to show them off as well which was well executed. And the whole hi tech futuristic technology was entertaining and interesting to watch as well so the world they built around these characters really boosted the movie. The action sequences were also fantastic throughout. I was consistently entertained throughout, and the large amount of sequences was appreciated with Vin Diesel being especially suited to this kind of genre.However, my first two negatives will be that I felt like the beginning was slightly to rushed and the set up that was repeatedly used throughout for Vin Diesel's character could have been more exciting. It would have been nice if they had spent more time at the beginning developing Vin Diesel's character and getting to understand him more instead of diving straight into the action without really knowing who he is. I also felt the repeated set up of the man he killed which was used with different people throughout could have been a bit more creative, I just personally thought it was slightly to bland and the stakes could have been much higher if it was going to be used repeatedly.My next two positives would be the films performances and the well-executed plot twists. Vin Diesel actually surprised me with his performance in Bloodshot. He has never been known at least in the films that I have seen him in to show any emotion or versatility with his acting but I was proven wrong in this film. He really sold his characters emotional pain about losing his wife very well which surprised me but in a good way. The film also managed to execute a fair few plot twists very well. I never saw all the big reveals coming which is always a good sign. When it was revealed that the antagonists were repeating the same situation repeatedly but with different faces from their hitlist I was surprised at how much it all made sense when it was revealed. So hats off to the creative team for this.My final negative for me would be that some of the dialogue throughout the movie was very clunky and awkward. A lot of the guards protecting the villains or trying to stop Bloodshot in the movie had very awkward and robotic one liners that did not fit in the movie whatsoever, which therefore made the pacing and the scenes with them in slightly clunky and stilted. However, my final positive would be the fantastic final act. When all the plot twists were revealed and the all the characters joined together you couldn't held but just sit back and enjoy what was about to unfold. They went all out with the action scenes and left it open for a hopeful sequel that left me satisfied with the end result.",Bloodshot

Life seems too good to be true and it's only enjoyed for a short duration. Ray's wife is captured, murdered and Ray himself is killed. But! After this tragedy, Ray wakes up in a lab with a completely changed body. His body has been donated to science. Upon waking up, Ray is reminded of his situation. We also know that Ray is now all alone and doesn't even have family who will miss him. But now he has new ability which have never been seen before. These abilities include Ray being able to selfheal and incredible strength all thanks to the latest advancement in technology. With this new body, Ray has been given a second changes and begins his new life by seeking revenge on the man who killed his wife and ruined his life.For those who are not aware, Bloodshot is one of the first films based on a Valiant Comic. In case you're wondering, Bloodshot differs from the standard Marvel, DC or general superhero story.For the most part actor Vin Diesel gives a likeable performance but sadly his character is wooden with very little back story for his audience to invest in. This type of character seems common when it comes to Vin Diesel films. I'm honestly not sure why this is common for him.One element that I did appreciate in Bloodshoot was the film's visuals and special effects. Seeing flesh shot off someone and reconnect was fun during action sequences. There are effects here that take away from realism by turning characters into full CGI, making this film look more like a video game. This type of visual takes away from the suspense but keeps the film a mindless action film.As a plot, I was a little curious about Ray's world but the so-called twists and consequences which involve the leading character are far too predictable. The reveal and main plot also feel like something movie lovers would have seen in the early 90s. It's unfortunate given the strengths of both the visual effects and the leading man that the film couldn't deliver a richer story.Overall, Bloodshot has an appealing setup but the outcomes for the leading man are predictable ones. Action sequences do manage to bring some creativity to the screen but at many times they also take away any realism making characters look more like a video game than film. This takes away any suspense or excitement I had desired. This film is fairly brainless and sometimes this type of film is exactly what a movie lover needs to enjoy the evening.

1. The cutting and editing are over-the-top, distracting, and annoying. There is also minor insertion of cheesy slow-motion.
2. Vin Diesel (Ray Garrison/ Bloodshot), Talulah Riley (Gina Garrison), Guy Pierce (Dr. Emil Harting), as well as near everyone else - with the exceptions of Sam Heughan (Jimmy Dalton) and Eiza González (KT) - give really wooden performances.
3. The score is massively overwhelming and obnoxious.
4. The lighting is incredibly flat and it makes the movie look really cheap at certain points.
5. The dialogue is often very clunky and cheesy, especially in regards to the debate around free will versus control.
6. The comedy tries way too hard to be funny, especially with the character of Wilfred Wigans (Lamorne Morris), and fails every-time.
7. Sam Heughan's American accent is patchy and he often veers into his natural Scottish accent. Moreover, his character's motivations are utterly non-existent.
8. Somehow Ray Garrison/ Bloodshot survives an up-close grenade blast even though he has no nanites left. The film never explains how.",Bloodshot
118,movieman6-413-929510,Bloodshot is messy movie from a starting director and eventually becomes long-winded.,4,15 March 2020,"Bloodshot is a new action movie directed by Dave Wilson. This is only the first film he has directed. He also directed only one episode of the TV series Love, Death & Robots.In the film, the killed soldier Ray Garrison (Vin Diesel) is brought back to life by the RTS Corporation using advanced nanotechnology. Dr. Emil Harting (Guy Pearce) informs Ray about what happened to him and how they got him back. In this way, Ray learns that nanobots are flowing through his veins, making him stronger than he was before and can further repair his body if he takes damage. Dr. Harting advises Ray to take it easy and get used to his new gifts. In vague visions, Ray sees what happened to him and thinks he can see the man who murdered him and probably even his wife. With his new skills, he tries to track down this killer so he can get revenge.That this is only the first film that Dave Wilson has directed is unfortunately reflected in how he put this film together. In the beginning, the film comes across as repetitive as in the films Goundhog Day and Edge of Tomorrow where the main characters do the same with a few minor variations in the story. In addition to repeatedly, the film is also quickly predictable thanks to the trailer and as a viewer you soon know more about the story than the characters themselves.
Dave Wilson has further worked in his film career on the special effects of films and even some video games. This is something he does together with a team. Although he now does the directing work alone, he knows together with the special effects team of this film to make sure that the special effects look nice in this film. It is only a pity that he has made the film difficult to follow. The action scenes are filmed too mobile and the different scenes are put together too hastily and messy. For example, it is difficult to follow what exactly happens or who fights against whom. They have also chosen to use too many slow motion effects with this film, which actually only make the film more tedious rather than more entertaining. For an equal, but better film, you can, for example, better watch the film Robocop.The acting is also not so special in this film. Vin Diesel tries to play a superhero with this role, but unfortunately without success. His best superhero acting remains in the Guardians of the Galaxy films where he only works as a voice actor with the same line. The rest of the cast also looks a bit underdeveloped as people who have also got new mechanical body parts, but otherwise you get little to no background information about them. The best acting comes from Eiza González, because she still manages to portray her role with some emotion and charisma in the film.",Bloodshot

The action scenes were ok, however the one around 40 minutes felt a bit anticlimactic. I usually watch movies with subtitles, but there weren't any available for this movie and I couldn't understand what was being said at times which was really annoying. I wasn't planning on watching this movie; I only did because there's not many other 2020 movies to watch and I would've watched it months ago if it had decent ratings and reviews.

Firstly, the story is quite simple, couple of twisted moments are very predictable because they was showed in the trailer. Secondly, I don't like characters, neither main nor others. Vin Diesel played Dominic Toretto in this film too, supporting characters are very pale. Main antagonist from Guy Pearce really copied from his character in Iron Man 3: he is scientist with injury who explores brain. Thirdly, visual effects are good.

The premise was promising and this time the script at least made some effort to justify Vin Diesel's indestructability; he was a war veteran that died and was returned to life by replacing the blood in his body with nano-robots that cure and repair every damage done to it. Sounds exactly like it is in the movie. Personally for me there were not many truly astounding action sequences, way too many slow motion shots and, as many movies nowadays are, this one had also a little less to zero to think about. The whole potential of the movie, and the best part of it, was the opening, before the credits roll. That's when you get to think of every soldier in every country that did or had done something just because he was ordered to. Any soldier is ordered not to think twice and just do what the big man says and Bloodshot is exactly that kind of soldier before he realizes all of the faults and mean nature of the big man. In short I expected a lot worse but was pleasantly surprised with this movie and even Diesel's performance.",Bloodshot

I have never been and never will be a fan of Vin Diesel.....he simply cant act !! He is not an actor , he is like a stuntman that has got lucky and been forced into the public spotlight to be made into a star. He is not even a good action film actor............to me thats people like Tom Cruise , Liam Neeson and Keanu Reeves...............so your more than welcome to stop reading and downvote or whatever.Nether the less I was going to give this film a try !! Try and throw all biases and pre conceived notions out before viewing it...........however it was very quick that I saw this was gonna be pretty dreadful........strangely though coming out of it I do think that the whole concept of the film, even though its not original in anyway, there is something interesting about it. All this film needed was better talent and quality infront of the camera..............and oh writing the script as well.I have one positive to the film and one only................the CGI and action was pretty cool , a bit new and yeah was quite interesting...........really liked it......Mmmmmmm but thats it.I am not going to cover Vin I'm afraid what is the point.........he might be a great guy but he has still not conVINced me that he can act or has shown me what everyone else can see in him.............I know I'm in the minority on this one!Guy Pearce, yeah I've always liked him even though he does do some stinkers now and then...........he was ok, maybe getting a bit of a pay check sort of performance.......but can you really blame him.Lastly oh what was that guy doing, Lamorne Morris...........I know he was probably told to act like that but just so spine numbingly awful at times, so cliched and stereotyped..........laughable..........he might be a good actor I'm not going to judge him for this film.Ah no I forgot Toby Kebbell..............wow has hollywood been desperately trying to make him a star , bless him...........I don't know I like the guy but he just gets involved in the wrong projects...........I think he an act but he is just plain weird in this film...............Strangely as I mentioned earlier there was promise with this idea of the main character and the story. All it needs is better actors , a better script , more serious tone and less humour.................you might just have something !?!? Unfortunately though we were given this pile of garbage in 2020........yes in 2020 films like this are still being made......I'm obviously in the minority as to why because I just don't see the appeal of dumb , easy , cliched and stereotyped stories/characters in a action film..........Its 30% out of 100 its pretty bad, only the CGI and the action scenes save it from being disastrous.........I just don't know anymore, can someone explain to me why stuff like this is popular ?!??!",Bloodshot

And while the action is powerful, it is also a bit more deep and emotional than most action films, especially his. It is a really inspiring story that is very well written.

This film gets right to the point and doesn't hesitate revealing the true nature of each character. The premise isn't original and although it's been done more times than I can count more recently the film ""UPGRADE""comes to mind but the pace of the film is quick so you never get a chance to harbor on the flaws of each scene. Plus it's always a treat to see Eiza Gonzalez so there's that. The Acting and special effects are of the usual Hollywood grade nothing spectacular Vin shows his usual grimace right before he roars with anger vowing to get revenge on the villain who double crossed him. But it's not a bad film it could've been a little more action it seemed kinda short but I guess they say time flys when your having fun.

Wigans however was hilarious and very likeable. He pretty much was the only person with any bit of characterization and charisma. Its hard to care about a character and thus a story if they're dull.Cinematography/special affects:
After watching ""extraction"" this has very dull action scenes in comparison. But it still has decent action scenes and really cool looking CGI. I do think the CGI is overused though.Story:
Really weird story but interesting on paper. The director made this a real Boring story with such lifeless acting and characterization with non stop action scene with CGI. Now yes this is a action film but a action film can still be boring if the action is overused. Just like how horror movies have comedy in there to break it up, this has none.

In a lot of ways, he is the wolverine of the Valiant universe and has a eye rollingly similar set of power and somewhat similar history. A bit too similar if you ask me and like Wolverine, he has no good story arcs... their popularity hinges entirely on them being stoic and violent (yes kid comic heroes that kill were considered edgy back in the day). In other words, these are not good characters for a film. Wolverine pretty much sucks in film too for the same reason. They are both, 1 trick ponies.They really needed to make a movie of some of the other characters like Solar (which predates the Doctor Manhattan by decades) or the Harbingers (dysfunctional hero family) or Archer and Armstrong (comedic heroes). All are far more interesting with much better stories to choose from than Bloodshot.Anyway back to this film, its a popcorn flick. Dont expect much more than that.",Bloodshot

I'm not sure that it is necessary to sell this movie, I'm on the fence. Selling it as a revenge movie with cool visuals would probably work for Diesel's core fanbase or anyone who just love action scenes no matter what the story is about. The phrase I highlighted and took out of the premise gives more subtances, more meat to the story. It could intrigue a casual action movie fan into seeing Bloodshot trying to figure out what the conspiracy is about. Saddly the marketing took that away from the viewer.It's not high art, and that ""conspiracy"" is not too difficult to figure out but they could have tried. Tried, among other things, to not give it away before the movie was out. Since for almost two third of the movie it is not adressed. They could have put more subtle clues about what's really going on before Ray discovers it, enticing audiences to watch the film a second and/or third time instead of the one and done it turned out to be.There are actors that I love in this film but they failed to level up the story. The performances were a little wooden but to be fair you can't make up what's not there. Although, Toby Kebbel kind of made it work, I really saw two dinstinct versions of the character he was playing. As for the rest of the cast they can count their blessings because people will forget they were even in this.The visuals are clearly a selling point of the movie - that is if you count Vin Diesel as a reason to see a film - and it's the only thing that some thoughts went into. For a debut film Dave Wilson has shown that he's good with action scenes and visual effects but still needs to show that he can direct actors, maybe in another movie with a...story.Bloodshot is action packed with awesome secenes and weak story, so leave your brain at the door and enjoy your popcorn.",Bloodshot

Just from the first bars of the film, it is clear that there is so much wasted potential; despite of a good cast, but unenthusiastic, the film fails miserably in a lot of points. The direction is wasted, it does not exalt the best points, there is an abuse of effects (not necessarily special) and it uses a lot of rallenty where it is not needed; ridiculous dialogues and MCU-style jokes (not necessary for the MCU either), played with bad timing; not to mention the swinging narrative without consistency, without any purpose. Basically, much more could be done, especially for all those fans who have never thought of getting a movie on Bloodshot and with whom would have started the Valiant Universe (let's call it in this way).

I would rate all of this as horrible!! Basically, a dead soldier gets reanimated. (Been there, done that). He still has the memories of his execution and his wife's killer. A corporation, headed by Guy Pearce's character, revives him through cybernetics. However, they are using him for... some reason...!!! They manipulate his memories through software cybernetics to get him kill whomever they wish, by changing the memory and the face of the real killer in his memories.

Toby Kebbell, Eiza González and Guy Pearce being the standouts. You know something is wrong when every member of the supporting cast shines out more than the lead.Jeff Wadlow who wrote Fantasy Island and Truth or Dare wrote this. I don't need to say anything else cause you know its gonna have horrendous writing. It does also suffer from Marvel Humour Syndrome and if it suffers from that, i will like the film so much less.That being said if you don't overthink the flaws, there is some fun to be had. It's somewhat entertaining with some decent action films even if it's so generically done. The visual effects are pretty substandard, it's obvious but not to the point where it is distracting.Overall there little of merit and is pretty bland and tasteless. It has it's enjoyment but that alone can't make the film. It's just lazy film making.",Bloodshot

The bad guys find him and kills his wife and him. Guy Pearce finds him and creates little tiny nano machines to be injected into Vin Diesel. Does It sound like Upgrade the movie? He hears a song and he goes on a revenge quest. However his memory is manipulated. So now he is made to be a weapon instead. Using technology to control one's free will is questionable. The trailer reveals a lot of plot points and made the movie predictable. The acting felt monotone. Sort took my feelings out of the movie. Bloodshot is a forgettable movie.

Too much special effect, even if it is a bit brushed away to a realistic outlook but still not fully (most of the time). What I does like is not a romantic touch to it (what he always have). I like the twist and plots and outcomes of some story lines of the main-character.

180,theemuhammede,"Action packed, but a bit much CGI in the end",6,13 March 2020,"I really enjoyed the concept of Bloodshot. He is a US soldier that was relentless and determined to complete his mission. He has some characteristics of a cross between Wolverine and The Punisher. Like Wolverine, Bloodshot is a soldier who went through genetic enhancement, and in Bloodshot's case, it is in the form of nano technology that gives him the ability to instantly heal and super strength. Like The Punisher, Bloodshot has the tactical training to take down an entire security team without breaking a sweat. But the name Bloodshot was not suitable for the character; I would have been more content with another name for him.The story was fantastic, and it was not too much. The trailers made it seem like Bloodshot would have his memory erased more times than what actually happened. I liked this better because it essentially was not frequently resetting the story. The entire movie was action packed, and it was fulfilling to get more of that than anticipated.RST, the company that developed Bloodshot, had an interesting take on who they had. Each member was scientifically modified and enhanced. My favorite was the character Jimmy Dalton. He an enhanced soldier with two prosthetic legs and has super speed. His chase against Bloodshot had me on the edge of my seat and it surpassed any of my expectations.Dr. Emil Harting (played by Guy Pearce) was an almost exact replica of Pearce's role as Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3. I like Pearce as an actor, but I wish the producers, directors, and creators of Bloodshot had a better developed character for Dr. Harting. It just gave way too many Iron Man 3 vibes when he was on the screen.",Bloodshot

It is very tedious. it is basicallly a super hero movie, where the super hero is Vin Diesel. it takes a lot of Wolverine, the movie and/or the character, but without the claws in the hands, and also with less charm. Unless you find the Vin Diesel rugged-machismo endearing (which I don't)I guess it is fine as an action film : the actors are ok, the dialogs are expectingly shallow, the cinematography and lighting are ok. The visual effects are nice and rather sophisticated, but it all in the service of the most boring story.The movie is kinda bad at the beginning but then in a twist it is revealed it was on purpose. The beginning of the movie is bad on purpose. Ok then! I have to admit that I took my eyes of my phone at that moment. But then the movie does not really operate on that twist and it resume to generic action movie.It is a weird mix of the Bourne Identity, Hardcore Henry, The Wolverine, X-Men Origins the Wolverine, Iron Man 3 and any movie Vin Diesel ever made.",Bloodshot

The writers realized this too having the characters making several references to stereotypes.There is really nothing to recommend it over any similar movie. The acting is okay. I'm not sure Guy Pierce decided to do this. Van Diesel is always Van Diesel which isn't bad if you like him. Most of the other characters are throw-aways. Too bad as I thought the KT actor could have had more screen time. The IT guys weren't bad either.It is silly to really criticize this kind of movie but there is a chase scene, supposedly through London, that is just foolish and would never happen and then a typically huge over-blown battle scene on the outside of the building that goes on too long and is so extreme as to destroy any pretense at subtilty earlier in the movie.The part I liked the most was the opening military scene and then Van Diesel with his wife afterwards, which we see parts of repeated, as that seemed a little more natural. There is a filler scene with Piece talking to Diesel in a simulated environment and the computer creates the wharf and everything on it. That was interesting but added only to show off the work of the programmers.If there is nothing else on then this is worth a watch if you get if for free.",Bloodshot

188,MovieWarfare,Another failed attempt at a cinematic universe,1,5 April 2020,"Bloodshot is the latest attempt by a studio to potentially start another cinematic universe and in this case, the Valiant Comics cinematic universe. The film stars Vin Diesel as the titular character, Ray Garrison (didn't even remember his actual name), who is brought to life by an advanced technology that gives him the ability of superhuman strength and fast healing and with these abilities, he will go avenge his wife. However, He soon comes to learn that not everything he learns can be trusted.One positive thing I can say about this movie is that the concept itself is really interesting. The main character's ability is cool and the premise itself is intriguing enough even though the trailer spoils it. Anyway, that is it.I love Vin Diesel because he sounds like an amazing person in real life but my god he sucks in this movie. His delivery for what is meant to be an emotional scene is so laughably bad. For example, his wife dies in front of him and he shows little to no emotion and its just so hilarious. Most of his scenes are either him being quiet or just yelling all the time and it is just so bad. The plot is also dumb and butchers the premise by making it become a generic sci-fi action movie. The bad guys are obvious and the good guys are also obvious right from the get-go which makes any twist feel dull. Apart from the titular character, none of the character motivation seems to make any sense. Good guys helping the main character just because they are good guys and bad guys doing bad things just because. You never really understand why any of these characters are doing things. Additionally, there are just so many scenes of endless exposition that dragged and feel like info dumps just because they want to treat us, the audience, as if they are stupid or something. The action scenes are also edited with rapid cuts that are just annoying. There is also so much CGI in all these very noticeable action scenes. To be fair the action scenes are so dumb that they are kind of fun to watch. There is an action scene where a CGI Vin diesel, yes you heard that right, is punching someone in an elevator while they are falling is kinda amazing. For David S. F. Wilson directorial debut, he did a terrible job. One nitpick of a terrible film, there was a scene in London where it was clearly not London and that baffled me so much because why did they have to call it London? There was no reason for it...Overall, this movie is the dumbest movie I watched in ages. This is a movie that feels like it came out 20 years ago and honestly probably should have never been made. However, this movie is so bad that it is kind of entertaining. My recommendation is to watch it drunk or with friends/family just to tear into the movie because you want a bad movie. However, if you're looking for an interesting superhero movie then I can safely say this isn't it.",Bloodshot

190,helenbassett,Bloodshot Film Review - Dave Wilson Directs Dead Man Walking Van Diesel As He Takes The Bad Men Down - Available To Download March 24,8,26 March 2020,"I caught Bloodshot on opening day, the last movie in the old style of showing in a cinema, before they closed down for Coronavirus. Directed by Dave Wilson and based on the Valiant Comic character, it is available to download March 24 with Van Diesel playing a tough marine taking down the bad guys. Of course he is, because Van Rambo is a hero.And when he comes home to his lovely wife, played by Talulah Riley, the hard man is loving and romantic. Until it's payback for his last job, with a dancing mercenary leader prepared to kill to find out what classified info Ray knew. Ray had his orders and followed them. He doesn't have the info. But the baddie doesn't take No for an answer. As Ray warns him that he'll track him down and take him out.....When Ray wakes up he's transformed. Literally. He's now Bloodshot, a walking talking super soldier. Guy Pearce's Dr. Emil Harting, I want to call him Dr Evil, it trips off the tongue so nicely, has created his own Frankenstein army, with Ray the newest member of the Elite team. The let's call them the T-, for tin soldiers Team, include Eiza González's Katie, Sam Heughan's Jimmy (it's the accent), and Alex Hernandez's Tibbs. One cannot breathe, one cannot walk and the other cannot see. But with Dr Emil's help our former Navy swimmer, Seal and Army Ranger are the future of military hardware. And we're talking the sci-fi of the future with Ray's blood now crawling with microscopic online robots, repairing any incoming damage. Of course Ray doesn't believe the Project Rising Spirit set up, until he sees the damage he can do. And what he can bench press. The man is an invincible machine.The only thing missing from this crack team is Ray's memory, until one day there's a flicker of something, a face and a name. And because Ray's supercharged blood has the online ability to find his target, he's off. Dr Emil's multi million dollar prototype is live, and on the loose. In Budapest. Revenge wasn't in the program! But Ray will always comes back.Dave Wilson's Bloodshot is a fun comic fantasy of violence that gets the job done. They had it coming, with pulsing special effects, and CGI that in slow motion lets you appreciate the stunts, unlike the wham bam blur of films and their what just happened. If you know Jake Gyllenhaal's Source Code you get the idea of where we're going, but Ray's not in a box. And while Van Diesel can handle the action I cannot really appreciate him as a romantic lead, so that always takes a little getting used to. Sam Heughan is Outlander's romantic lead Jamie, and here he flexed his muscles but his character was a bit boring and didn't get the pulse running either. Tibbs doesn't even have a character. Eiza González apparently missed out on being Robert Pattinson's Catwoman. I would have liked to see her in the role after seeing her work here. Lamorne Morris was fun as an unexpected geek techie. While Guy Pearce had a ball as Dr Frankenstein with an agenda.We know it's not King Lear, it's fluffy comic book action, so jus rol with it. While costume design for Van Diesel always economically runs to army fatigues and white vests, it was fun in the age of coronavirus when you need a distraction.",Bloodshot

I absolutely ENJOYED the hell out of this movie. It reminds me more of one of the most literal cursed movies ever ""The Crow"" which was 1 of my all-time favorite movies that I wish they would remake with Jason Momoa. He is, however, his abilities is not due to the act of God or Nature. So then u can say it has a bit of ""RoboCop"" in it because of the underlining scientific structure which creates Ray Garrison's abilities or lack thereof if someone controls him. I think Vin Diesel was PERFECT for this movie & as usual, the gorgeous Eiza Gonzalez did an outstanding job herself. Then Lamorne Morris made it funny as all hell, sry Siddarth Dhananjay ur joke was funny but came up short.

Outside of the box, unpredictable and...wow.Though I didn't like it was too fast paced & trying to squeeze & cram in multiple camera shots & angles in every scene thru the whole thing, but I still love the movie.I especially & truly love the most is my most favorite girl in the universe... Eiza Gonzalez and her character KT. They stood out the most and I love that. Such as one of eiza's earlier characters (""santanico pandemonium"" of from dusk till dawn: the series), kt was the heart, soul & main backbone of the movie. Seriously, she saved bloodshot many times, stopped the bad guys from causing more trouble and destroyed their building. Also, she was both strong & emotional person. Love that very much.Though eiza had small roles lately and two of the movies she was in are not my favorites, I love & respect eiza and her choices. and I love all of her characters. I'm very happy eiza had a fun time doing the movies, getting more notice & popular then ever and got along with & learned from her favorite directors, actors & actresses. But still, those ""cameo/special guest star"" roles were not enough to fully recognize her talents/gifts. Because what I've seen from her dusk till dawn show, clips from her telenovelas, the supplies music video, her other recent movies, paradise hills, she's missing and now bloodshot,... Eiza deserves Emmys & Oscars. BIG time!!!. So happy that eiza finally got a bigger role, tons more screen time and more recognition that she deserves in a hollywood movie.I pray/hope that they make a sequel and focus more on kt equally as much as bloodshot.

It was like a student project but somehow the student has a very rich dad, so the student can spend alot of money on CGI. The sound department did a terrible job, the whole film sounded like a 90's tv movie.

205,tranat71,I love this movie!,10,8 May 2020,"I just saw the new Vin Diesel film ""Bloodshot"" in 4K Dolby Atmos from Sony Studio.The movie was shot using the 8K Panavision DXL2 digital camera. There are only about 8 other films shot using 8K digital cameras. Only about 8 other films were shot using 8K digital cameras - Seven Worlds One Planet, Midway, Mission Impossible Fallout, Captain Marvel, Maleficent Mistress of Evil, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2, Mortal Engines, The New Mutants.Picture quality is great, as expected from the 8K camera.Sound quality is very good. Atmos wasn't always active, but when they do use them throughout the movie (usually voices overhead), I thought it was effective.So I would still give ""Bloodshot"" thumbs up for the Atmos soundtrack.What about the plot? I loved it. :DIt's a Sci-Fi, so not everything is 100% believable. But it seems like almost everything and everyone had a reason.For example, I would risk my life to save you - but not just because I'm kind or just for the heck of it. I risk my life to save you because if I don't do this, I would literally die! :DSo for plot, I would say it's one of the best plots I've seen. And overall, I like this movie a lot for good character, story, Atmos sound, and Picture (8K camera).Again, the Atmos is not always active, but it is used throughout the movie and I liked it.And other elements - it has a sexy female lead, plenty of special effects, plenty of eye candy.IOW, it's got pretty much everything. But most importantly, it has a very good plot.",Bloodshot

From a plot point of view; meshing Terminator, Robocop and Total Recall and stirring in some nanotechnology makes some sort of sense - in a weird sort of way.However rhythm, timing and flow is crucial in these types of films. Somehow Bloodshot manages to do a botch job of all of them. The overall sensation is rather ""choppy"" with the feeling much was lost in the cut. It's a shame - because lurking there somewhere is the feeling that there is much more to deliver with, relatively little effort.The script alone is enough to push it beyond mediocrity - but not by much.",Bloodshot

No one can even assume a bit about the suspense of this film until it is revealed after first half.Those who are fans of Vin Diesel from his Fast & Furious Movie Series , they are surely going to Respect this film of his. Vin Diesel not only delivers energetic action scenes but the acting is also touchy.The special effects in this movie are worth of its $45 M budget. They are amazing & keeps us on our feet. This movie is alone worth of watching for its super amazing special effects. You'll see that every scene has been emphasised enough to understand which makes this movie easy to digest for everyone.Cinematography is so detailed that every action scene is felt by the audience deeply. That is the one best feature of this film. Neither too slow neither too fast but detailed concepts.Every action scene in this movie DOESN'T AT ALL feels as cliché but new & creative.The suspense is Unbelievable and the ending is Satisfying.The fun part in this film is Mr. Lamorne Morris !

If you so called critics are going to give the Avenger movies 9 and 10 star ratings then your smokin crack not to at least give this a 7 or 8.The Avenger movies are all the same. Getting ran into the ground IMHO.This movie had a good story. I actually love the plot from the comic books.Every time I see Vin Diesel I think of two things. The dude from fast to furious, and a smaller guy who wears shoes with big heels to make him look taller. I wish he never did the latter. Just embrace your actual height man, it's weird to alter your height in movies. So I really don't watch his movies.However, this movie was good. After 15min it didn't bother me that it was Vin Diesel anymore in the lead roll. He did a good job with this movie.At least a 7 star movie. 8tops.

216,franklindf,Universal Soldier Update,6,27 April 2020,"If you've seen the somewhat vintage Universal Soldier with Van Damme, then you've basically seen this. I am assuming they just figured people had forgotten about that movie or their target audience is too young to know about it. If we put that aside, this isn't a bad movie. I have a pretty serious crush on Eiza González so that alone did wonders for me. She doesn't exactly play a sexy character, more of a corporate type but the visual appeal is still there. Vin Diesel isn't bad, I would say he fulfills the purpose. There is a lot of action and it's done well, the fighting is tight and it doesn't drag on for ages like some movies that use action to substitute for plot. The plot here is fairly basic but it's fairly satisfying with a sci-fi focus about regenerative tissue and neural programming. Not a super memorable movie but satisfying for what it is and a good watch.",Bloodshot

219,FilmChamp20,Had so much potential,5,25 March 2020,"This movie was fun to watch for superhero like power fueled fight scenes. Unfortunately, that's about it.The story was rushed and not much was explained. The whole movie felt rushed and like it was a fun side project.If they would have spent more time on the story and chose a better actor for Bloodshot, this could have been a better movie. Vin looked nothing like Bloodshot at all. There are so many actors to choose from that would have been a better choice. Vin was the biggest burden of the film in my opinion. All I saw was, well, Vin being himself...or Dom. If you sat down at a random moment into this movie not knowing what it was, you'd think it was a fast furious movie that totally lost its touch.The next part that was bad was the effect towards the end of the movie and final fight scenes. The CGI, animation of the actors, and green screening were horrendous, to say the least.Next, which have got to be said, is he looked like a bald Bloodshot for like 10 seconds and then went back to being Vin...the ending didn't even give a hint of him becoming Bloodshot.That's the final part that made this movie bad. The ending. It was so awful and cringey. They clearly didn't know how to end it. Hallmark card dialogue and drive off into the sunset...literally. It was a fast and furious ending if it were made from the LifeTime channel.Get rid of Vin. Keep Eiza, Lamorne, and Guy. They were fine and the only good parts of the movie. I want to see more of Eiza being a badass and fighting and I want to see more of Lamorne's character as he was very enjoyable. Reboot it with a better actor for Bloodshot for god's sake. Give it to Jason Frank at the very least. He would have given the character his all as he's played him already in fan made films.I really wish the movie was better.

I haven't read the comics and to be honest, I don't think I had ever even heard of Bloodshot before the film, but I seriously hope it gets a sequel. Its really open ended and paves the way for whatever road they want to take it down next. Being unfamiliar with the comics, I have no earthly idea where they'll take it next if they do proceed with the story, but after seeing this, I'm sure it won't disappoint!",Bloodshot

Once again technology can be both good and bad. It depends entirely on who uses it.The movie - a mix of action & sci-fi - is a generic Vin Diesel action flick. Not that is a bad thing. If you like these types of movies and/or a Vin Diesel fan, then you won't come away disappointed.And while parts of the movie was utterly predictable, it was still enjoyable to watch.

224,thomasmitilis1995,VENGEANCE IS WHAT MAKES A MAN LIKE YOU EXCEPTIONAL...,4,25 April 2020,"PROS:The film is an another comic book adaptation that tries to give prominence to a lesser-known hero. The plot twist about Bloodshot's past is cool and reinforces the interest for the film (until at least a certain point). The action sequence in the tunnel is solid and the use of colors makes it visually interesting. Eiza Gonzalez proves once again that she is a good action star and her action scene is well choreographed. The CGI nanotech looks pretty cool and Toby Kebell is delightful in the interrogation scene.CONS:The script is generic and the comic book hero isn't properly adapted. Vin Diezel is wooden as Bloodshot and acts in the same way he always portrays his characters. The dialogue also doesn't help him and he delivers some lines by just yelling. There is a lot of exposition and some things are repeated twice. Moreover, the constant use of slow motion is distracting and the elevator scene is poorly directed. The first action sequence is poorly edited (sloppy and fast cuts) and the defeating of Guy Pierce's character is anticlimactic. Sam Heughan is so annoying for no apparent reason and the comic relief characters (Morris and Dhananjay) are just bland.",Bloodshot

Then humanity needs to take over the human technology, and that's what we experience, Human technology vs. humanity.A technology that can rebuild the human blood tissues and make him so strong that he cannot die of any injury, and on the other side same person's mind is controlled by technology as well which can take his mind to past or present and rebuild any scenario with any changes. That's where the misuse of technology starts when a doctor puts in technology in another person to take advantage of both humans and technology, but obviously, technology cannot take over feelings and that's what makes this movie so predictable. Yes! It goes with very common scenarios instead of having a vast imagination stage. No doubt the action, camera work, and editing is above all that makes it interesting especially the action scenes just before the ending. But it could have gone much vaster in writing and imagination. It also gets a little bit slow in between but the pace it takes after that is boom! That's where the most interesting part is, those slow-motion action scenes and the victory of the humanity of humans.must try this as the story has some kind of newness but it doesn't go at that hype level just because better than this has been made before.

The beginning looks like a typical Vin Diesel flick. Then it takes a twist and it's a pleasant surprise (for those who know nothing about the source material). Of course, it's nowhere near the quality of Pitch Black (sigh) but as I said, it's pleasant.
Alas, when all gets established, there's not much screen time left. The movie doesn't fully capitalize the premise but the concept is still enough to keep you invested till the end. I would like all of that to be just an opening premise and the true plot to be about something else there isn't really anything else and to be honest, I wouldn't know how push in anything more without the movie being five hours long.

We get some explanation in the beginning of the film of what is going on, that was all cool to watch, but soon after that all goes & we get straight into the rather boring story line of, nanotech brings man back to life and still has the memories of the guy killing his wife & he gets revenge a few times because the good guys plant a different face on his killer everytime. Thats the story in a nutshell, it does sound cool, but it needed more time to be explored, i would of liked to see the first film about the the nanotech company & how & what is done to make this nanotech & the tests they have to do on people with different results, maybe a couple go rouge & they simply have to kill them, but then leave it on a cliff hanger where they finally find a new strain of nanotech bots & then Vin Diesel come along with the cliffhanger of him being injected with the new tech.Then the 2nd film is about him going through the new tech & him trying to be controlled by the doctor but then include his past memories & that he has to try & combat this, even make this film the 2nd one followed by a 3rd one where Vin Diesel then gets revenge on the company that bring him back to life. Thats my take on what the films could of been, but instead we got a rushed clunky bad acted film, albeit it with awesome looking visuals & such a cool concept which isn't to farfetched in the real world we would like to think.I just feel like if they take out the cool visuals it is very bland & predictable. As for Vin Diesel, well he is basically Toretto in every film.I really think they did miss a opportunity here & as a result of this, it will be another bad rated film that will be forgotten in the years to come. It gets a strong 6 from me purely on the concept & the visuals.Age - 25Cinema: Cineworld Milton Keynes 2D (Unlimited Card)Watch, Avoid, Consider: Do watch if you have unlimited card as why not, enjoy the visuals but otherwise just consider.",Bloodshot

243,Chris_Ego,a visual spectacle,7,28 October 2021,"""Bloodshot"" is the first film based on Valiant Comics. Starring Vin Diesel as the main character Bloodshot, we get to see the updated version of ""Universal Soldier"" produced with the latest CGI technology. Funny sidenote: In ""Memento"" (2000) Guy Pearce played Leonard, a man who has developed a short-term memory loss syndrome. Here in ""Bloodshot"" he is the mad scientist who deliberatly infuses memory loss to our anti hero.Being the directorial debut of Dave Wilson this feature film celebrates nifty enhancements, nanobot fantasies and superhero clichés. However they did it in a very entertaining way and they kept me hooked with little details and funny moments. The choreography in all the fight scenes featuring Vin Diesel are extremly well shot. Sometimes he throws a strong punch and people are flying all over either hitting a car or a wall. The action is HILARIOUS. And that is why I like this film since it doesn't take itself as serious as you might expect. It is by far not a superhero comedy like ""Deadpool"" but it has its cheeky moments.Storywise it is bloated and there are too many topics being adressed without going somewhere particular. The past of Bloodshot is constantly being rewritten and before you wrap your head around the latest information being passed on, the revenge run is over. With a runtime of almost two hours I would have been okay if Bloodshot's wife and their common past would not be an issue anymore after the first half of the film. And the involvement of the geeky Wilfred Wigans is getting more wicked by the minute. So a little less would have been more for my taste.Eiza González as KT is hot as hell!The soundtrack by Steve Jablonsky is bombastic!Cinematography by Jacques Jouffret lacks of perfect ratio. At times the actors look squeezed or squashed.I found this trivia amusing:

As the biggest drawback with the film is that it is more of an action film than a superhero film or in other words it is a Vin Diesal film over a superhero film. Vince Diesel entirely owns the film. The action sequences and the chemistry between Diesel and Lamorne were one of the few highlights of the film. Otherwise the supporting actors including Guy Pearce or Eiza Gonzalez are under-utilized and the film is entirely predictable.

I did find the psycho killer scene quite amusing, there were moments of humour throughout the film. At some point during the film I got very confused over location as one moment it was said location (a), then suddenly without explanation was location (b) and (c) in completely different countries within Europe... overall final feeling to the film was that if you want something to not pay attention to or a harmless bit of fun but if you want to engross yourself in the film this is not recommended.",Bloodshot

The london scenes are clearly shot outside Europe by the looks of the chase scene throughout the so called London streets...nice mexican style houses and a police car with foreign plates.

I wish I could say Bloodshot changes that but unfortunately it's another one to add to the list of ""almost but not quite Vin"". The movie itself had a kind of cheap feel to it, the CGI looking like something from a good video game but that doesn't really cut the mustard when applied to a superhero movie, especially these days. The story itself doesn't race along in so much that it ambles. And I get trying to save money but trying to pass off Cape Town as London, sorry but no. Even someone who's only ever seen footage of London will know that's not London, heck even someone who's only ever seen a picture of London will know that's not London.

Even if the plot itself is relatively simple and straightforward, I believe that Cass is the choice. Fans of film standards will not be disappointed. In the special effects and action scenes, not only the two key fighting scenes in the tunnel and elevator have a certain level of level, giving people a full sense of two different styles of stimulation and shock. Among them, ""Blood Warrior"" was hit by a gun. The slow-motion footage of the nano robot in the body scattered from various parties to the restoration, also makes the entire movie of ""Blood Warrior"" into an entertaining visual feast.

He can also convincingly portray a man who doesn't know what's going on (probably because he doesn't actually know what's going on) - but that's about the limit of his range. Many an action star has been acted off screen by his co-stars. Diesel is acted off screen by his own biceps.Does this matter?

295,filmsbyq,"Brainless, Inoffensive Actioner",6,13 April 2020,"Bloodshot is an okay, perfectly watchable action, sci-fi. With Vin Diesel going full Vin - sleeveless tee, swagger and a scowl. Bloodshot was never going to be one to tax the brain. The twist of him being controlled by scenario implants was a nice one and elevated the story above similar fare even if it is not the most original.Written by Jeff Wadlow and Eric Heisserer, from a comic by Kevin VanHook, Bob Layton and Don Perlin, the story is supposed to be a backdrop for the action but some of the action sequences are so laborious and over-the-top it is difficult to appreciate them. Directed by David S. F. Wilson, there is a lot of slo-mo employed for effect and too many of the action scenes are over-long.The visual effects are quite good, very reminiscent of the latest Terminator films. Morris - best known for his turn in New Girl - is the light relief in the film and puts on a good English accent as the computer-genius Wiggins. González's KT could have been any number of Latina actresses gracing our screens. Not that she is bad. It is just that the performance is not noteworthy.Similarly, Heughan was always working uphill to make Dalton seem like anything other than a bully. Hernandez's Tibbs leave even less of an impression than González's KT, such is the pointlessness of the character. Pearce, an actor who has turned in some incredible performances over his career, phones in another villain with a showing that any B movie actor could probably have brought.As I have said, Bloodshot is watchable and quite good for the most part. The most eye-rolling thing is the CGI heavy, long to the point of boring, battle between Ray, Dalton and Tibbs. At one hundred and ten minutes long, Bloodshot does not feel as long as it is and moves swiftly through its runtime.Bloodshot is a passable actioner and worth a look if you like a brain-in-neutral action film.",Bloodshot

It's budget was somewhat less than most blockbusters but still in the $50 million range, ( that's an estimate on the low side).
I can't remember the last time I yawned watching a movie. Just gave up. I hardly remember anything about it. Apart from Guy Pierce ( yet another bizarre choice from him; paycheck must have been to his liking. He loses a lot of credibility being in this. His choise I guess).

And seriously, do you have to make a character extremely talkative & slightly funny to make him stand out in the crowd? There were good black characters in the movies before forced diversity came along. Forest Whitaker didn't have to be that yacky & annoying in 'Phone Booth' & 'Panic Room' to be interesting. We loved his character. I'm also not a huge fan of Vin Diesel. The only really cool characters in the movie were, Dalton & Tibbs while Harting was also a very important character.

309,lmathc,Unapologetic Sci-Fi Action Mayhem At Its Best,8,15 March 2020,"Bloodshot is a 2-hour testosterone-fueled knockout of a film. One should not go into this movie expecting a deep, intellectual journey with moving and bold themes. Bloodshot is not Oscar bait, nor does it try to be. Instead, in a world of preachy films with ulterior motives, this movie decides to do exactly what it should: give an escape from reality via explosions, fistfights, and shootouts.Vin Diesel stars as the protagonist and, though he won't be getting nominated for best actor, gives a solid performance that captures all of his best characteristics. His supporting cast plays well off his screen presence and there are some legitimately great moments between his co-stars. Eiza González especially does an impressive job and plays the role of female action hero believably, though to be honest, she could have stood there for two hours and still would have made a valuable contribution to the movie.Bloodshot truly shines, however, when it dives fully into comic book mode. Each action scene is deliberate, beautifully shot, and captures perfectly the essence of what a comic book is. One scene in particular was absolutely stunning with its use of colors, focus, and transitions. Fans of the genre will feel as though they have been sucked into the pages of a gritty and color-rich graphic novel.In summary, Bloodshot does exactly what it sets out to do: tell a straightforward story about a comic book anti-hero. Fantastic action, beautiful cinematography, and a likeable cast set it several notches above the majority of Vin Diesel's other films. I can only hope that this is not the last we see of him in this role.",Bloodshot

Was I expecting it to be this bad though? No, although I'm not at all surprised with Vin Diesel, but why is Guy Pearce in a film this bad?Add to this genetically modified cyborg bad guys dressed like chavs in their tracksuit bottoms and the fake English accent that Hollywood thinks all English characters should have, this film really never had a chance.

The reason I think it's considered weak I've marked further down as a spoiler, though it probably isn't, but just in case.Sure, the film (as with pretty much any action flick ever) is pretty predictable. It's not meant to be a thriller. It's Hollywood action. The ""good"" has to win. (And the film is pretty self conscious about it.) Anyways. Unlike many other average or below action movies, Bloodshot doesn't contain too much unnecessary exposition or hand holding. There's nothing too complicated going on in the first place to be honest but still, credit for that.Action shots are beautiful and well executed. Though on occasion the scenes suffer from over editing and noticeable GCI (it doesn't look too bad, it's just noticeable). But most of all, the story holds together. Sure, it's not too extravagant and/or heartfelt, but at least it doesn't contain braindead plot decisions.SPOILER mabye?Perhaps the major flaw of the film is that Diesel's character is essentially an undying super human and that lowers the stakes and the overall tension. Though things can hurt him, he just can't die. He's Kind of like a brooding version of Deadpool with vendetta. He just can't lose. There's no way. He can't be stopped.

Attempting to send up revenge tropes with some inspired genre subversions, first-time feature filmmaker Dave Wilson introduces several grandiose themes, yet, like our generic protagonist, has very little to say about any of them. Despite the best efforts of a committed cast alongside our brooding star, including solid performances from the talented Eiza González and a perfectly cast Guy Pearce (what was the name of that Nolan film again?), and some gorgeous visual effects work, moviegoers and comic book fans deserve much better and will be left wondering why this wasn't adapted as a video game.4/10 techno babble dumps.",Bloodshot
336,sarandivyam,A below average movie.,3,28 March 2020,"Well yesterday I watched Vin Diesel's latest flick 'Bloodshot' and you might be familiar with the name because it is based on the character of same name created by Kevin VanHook, Don Perlin and Bob Layton. The film is based on the life of a U.S. Marine Ray Garrison and his wife Gina. He is a very brace and daring officer who never fears death. While on a holiday with his wife, they both suddenly gets kidnapped and were finally killed. Further, it is shown that a lab named 'Rising Spirit Tech.' resurrects Garrison but just only to use him for their personal negative motives.
The film is a waste of time, money and energy as well. I find no novelty in the story of the film. You may watch Deadpool or Spider-Man instead of sparing money to watch this non-sense piece of action. I was really very bored and at the end even was very tired to see such old stories being re-used again and again, and the only difference is they use some new, high quality graphics, VFX, etc.
Vin Diesel and Eina Gonzalez have done justice to their roles but they alone can't save the film. I say that the storyline is the heart of the film and because the storyline was poor, so even direction and screenplay can't save it, though neither too impressed me.

338,letande,"It's nice to see Valiant Comics on big screen, but the movie needs more story.",5,13 March 2020,"First of all, I think I can call myself a fan of Valiant Comics. Well, not the die-hard fan, but still, those comics are a pretty big part of my life and mean quite a lot to me. Not all of them and not all of the runs, but... you know how it is. The certain runs of Turok, Ninjak, X-O Manowar and, most importantly, Shadowman... I just love them. So, even though Bloodshot was never among my favorite characters from Valiant, I was still glad that their universe made it to the big screen and went to theater to support it. Did I like it? Well... that's the tricky question.See, Bloodshot is a comic book movie. Not because it's based on the comic. But because it FEELS like a comic. And not in a good way. It's cheesy, it comes with a weird screwed up logic, it doesn't even try to give you enough depth, etc, etc, etc. As the result, people who don't read comics would probably end up disliking it right away. Comic book readers, on the other hand, would feel right at home here. Which doesn't mean that they'll necessarily like it, though. Just because Bloodshot is, like, the most common origin story you can ever imagine. Sure, there's a twist that actually makes you wake up at some point and see things in different perspective, but it's not enough to save the entire movie. The thing is - Bloodshot just isn't interesting enough. It's yet another story about how yet another cool guy kicks some random evil butts and that's pretty much it.And design-wise? There's quite a lot to argue with. When it's about Bloodshot, it's all about two things - gray skin and the round red mark (placed on the chest for majority of the time). Gray skin is there. Mostly like an Easter egg for those who care, but at least Dave Wilson and his team were smart enough to include it. The round red mark, on the other hand, was replaced by some sort of light in the chest. Doesn't look that bad, I kinda liked that red glow beneath the ribs, but the thing is - it makes the character less recognizable. I mean, in the comics, that red circle had different origin from run to run and it even looked different, but it was always there one way, or another. It was, like, Bloodshot's thing and even when the red circle was moved to his belt during the Acclaim period run, it was still the gray skin and the red circle. With no gray skin for most of the time and no red circle whatsoever... It's really hard to see Vin Diesel as a Bloodshot here.Talking about Vin Diesel. I don't think I'll surprise anyone when I'll say that he's a pretty poor actor. But that's not really a problem here. When it's about action movies, it's not about complicated acting. It's about the right person at the right place. Good ol' Arnie didn't even speak English well enough. And look at what he achieved. Same thing with Diesel. Even though his roles are not nearly as iconic, he sure shined as Richard B. Riddick and Dominic Toretto. Does he fit in Bloodshot? Well, yeah. Looks a lot like Ray Garrison from the current comic run and kind of gives you the right vibe. No complains here.So... it's not like I hate this movie, or something. I'm sure glad that Valiant Comics made it to the big screen. I can also see some potential here. With enough talent and enough work, there's actually a chance to create a nice cinematic universe. Especially if they'll add Shadowman (I can only dream about proper adaptation of Michael LeRoi's run). But if we'll take Bloodshot for what it is... Let's just say that even the last year's Hellboy from Dark Horse and Lionsgate did better. Bloodshot ended up being too cheesy for a regular viewer and too shallow for comic book fans. Who just had way too many of this kind of stories to enjoy another one. A big collaboration would totally save this.

In the beginning, it seems like the film was going to be just one of those ''the wife gets killed, and the badass husband kills the bad guys'' genre film. Yet, Bloodshot manages to topple the audience's expectations by a brilliant twist, and by doing so, completely change the direction of the movie while giving the first half of the film a new layer to it. It seems like the film's going to be great, right?Hmmm...nope.
Now, even though the first half was fine, it wasn't great overall. The characterization is awful, which this goes for every character in the film, as the characters range from stereotype to complete absence. Take the guy who used to be blind until the company helped him build a new digital eye. He has no reason in being in this film, as his presence is unnoticeable, he has no personality whatsoever, and his demise feels lackluster. Same for other characters. The hacker is a walking Deus ex Machina with a bit of personality. The love interest is the love interest.
The story also loses its ingenuity after the twist, as it decides to rely on overused tropes and cliches to push the rest of the story forward.

+ It is competently made. Technically everything is there.
+ Eh...
The bad:
The plot is so generic it made my eyes bleed. And it is so stupid. I don't want to spoil anything but ""talk about doing things in a roundabout way"".The cringe is strong with this one. Pretty much all scenes with Vin and women are really off-putting. I get the feeling that Vin had something to do with these scenes being in the movie, just sad and cringe.Bland action. It tries to set up cool sequences like a fight scene in flour, but it all just looks generic and ""things just happen"". Bang bang, punch, boom explosion.Waste of money. Take a look at a movie like ""Upgrade"" that was made for a fraction of the money and that does so much more than this. No Marvel rubber men flying all over the place action, just well acted, well executed scenes that feel real and grounded.Everytime I see Vin in these generic movies I wish that I was watching a Riddick movie instead, there is so much more going on with that character and the world he inhabits. Fingers crossed for Furia, please do a good job!",Bloodshot

The action was well shot, apart from the flour battle.The amount of flour and firearms involved would have just imploded the whole area. Flour is super flammable, duh.But other than that it was an enjoyable action movie. Helped by the fact that Lamorne Morris is funny albeit in a wasted role and Eiza Gonzalez oozes charm in, u guessed it, in another wasted role.I'm looking forward to seeing them both in better written productions.Good production values, interesting action sequences and the oh so hot Eiza make this a movie that's worth a viewing, maybe not the admission cost though.",Bloodshot

Vin Diesel is an invincible super soldier in the movie. It immediately reminded me of some of the older movies from eighties and nineties like Universal Soldier.

When I watch a movie based on a comic, there's a good chance that it's going to be silly but entertaining.Big names are often indicative of a sensible budget to do the movie some justice but it seems that the budget didn't extend to paying for both cast and location.Being a Brit, I thought ""aye, aye, some London action"". Erm, hold on, there's no teleportation in this movie is there? Nope, there isn't but for some reason the producer thought no one would notice that the fight scene switched back and forth between the streets of London and what I assume to be the suburbs of Hollywood.The initial scene may have been set by a black cab trundling along the road and the aerial views from the spy drones were certainly more indicative of London but the running, jumping and ground level scenes were certainly NOT shot in London. Houses, alleyways, cars were all US, number plates included.I enjoyed the premise of the film but this ruined it for me because it was an insult to the intellect and intelligence of the film goer; this assumption that no one would notice such shocking inconsistencies - very sad.I had no particular expectations but to see a bit of Sci-Fi action but even with the bar set so low, it was a disappointment.",Bloodshot

It didn't disappoint me, as I went in knowing exactly what was going to be served on my screen, so came away happy and content that Bloodshot is fun, silly and a very good action movie.This got an 8/10 because I would have preferred this to be a Mature movie, it deserved to be, as the content would be ripe for adults, but as usual greed took hold, just so it could reach a wider audience.While the topic of AI/nanite infused soldiers/humans etc is nothing new, this isn't a patch on Upgrade, which covered the topic amusingly and viscerally, so if I was to choose between the two, even though Bloodshot had a bigger budget, more famous actors and lots more techy bits - Upgrade wins, hands down.I'm not putting this movie down, I enjoyed every minute of it, but this is becoming a regular topic and is becoming tiresome, but do not let these words put you off from viewing this, because this is one of those movies that's great with some buddies/partner/beer/popcorn...or all four together!Just relax, enjoy the fun and don't think about the major errors in the shooting and dialogue!!",Bloodshot

When I compare to Hobbs and Shaw, which had NO heart this was SO much better than just action for actions sake with some wisecraking dolts thrown in.
First of a planned series, based on Valiant comics, it was good enough for me to want to see the next, as this was limited by having to tell the backstory.
Vin Diesel is the best Action Star at present, so that entails a sacrifice of the eclectic. You don't see him outside this genre much because he is so good at it. And he usually chooses the right types of story that are more
Vin Diesel has found the Answer to $making heaps of money = FAMILY
all his movies now play on this basic concept, build a family that the viewers can care about as we all love our family. So he figured that out in F&F and then has used it in XXX (X takes care of it's own) and Last Witch Hunter (#2 on the way - Micheal Cain was the father figure and next will be with his wife and my guess is baby)",Bloodshot

In fact outside of the comic the plot and concept are pretty new to cinema.. I think they were connecting individual elements and then conflating it all.Of course being an action/sci-fi as opposed to pure sci-fi this was inevitable, and with action you get a lot of viewers who indeed had seen the action type seen before (though i thought it was creative and not done in that way previously) but who maybe wanted a longer, Pitch Black type of flow to the movie..I've seen a lot of sci-fi and even though I saw the plot twist coming, frankly I wasn't sure and engaged enough in it that it still gave me a nice surprise.I do hope that they renew this and I'd be interested to see were it goes (not having read the comic superhero backstory at all) ..",Bloodshot

Thanks to the trailer, there were absolutely no surprises, though even without the trailer it would have been easy to guess the ending fifteen minutes into the movie. The fight scenes were entertaining, but would have been better if the camera hadn't been moved around so much. Oddly enough, the best action sequence in the whole film involved Eliza battling unnamed henchmen, with Vin Diesel completely absent from the scene.In short, the acting was okay, the plot was solid -- albeit predictable, -- the effects were decent, and there was plenty of action.

At least I don't have to watch the start again, and settled in as i was bathed in cheesy screenwriting and even sketchier acting.Then came the reveal and I've gotta say I was delighted. The kinetic set pieces were tight and engaging and the CGI was on point. Guy Pierce pitched his bad guy perfectly against Ray's would-be villains. Ray and his supporting characters weren't deep, but they certainly weren't flat and decent acting and direction of the main cast more than made up for some of the peripheral duds.This movie is straight-up comic-book fare, so if you come to this movie hoping for a sophisticated narrative, you'll just wind up annoying those of your friends who pegged it from the start for the lurid action-fest it is.

Vin Diesel is typical Vin Diesel: mediocre actor who is pretty darn good at action sequences (though the first three major action sequences are mediocre at best). However, it's a fine way to pass the time between Outlander episodes, as long as you're okay with seeing Sam Hueghan cast as your typical Chad with no motivation, background or storyline (but hey, it's Sam Hueghan; who's really here for the character arc?).",Bloodshot

430,Altered-Reality,"Mixed Blessings, But read my review.",7,4 March 2021,"First off, i thought this had the premise to be quite an intellectual and scientifically based movie, obviously with action (as always seems to be the way with Vin Diesel movies). But, it descended into the realms of Marvel and DC films that we have been overdosed with in recent years, where the ""Hero"" fights ""Evil"". If you shut off your comparisons to other recent action films, this is quite enjoyable. I would watch it again, but it is nowhere near the top of my list. Make up your own mind, and if you agree with opinion, give this review a 'Helpful' comment.",Bloodshot

Writing is horrendous however, juvenile sub-teen level at best.I'd give it 5 stars if it was less bloody and violent because a 13-year-old might enjoy this movie, but the violence level requires someone that is older than that yet it is too poorly done for a reasonably intelligent adult to enjoy.",Bloodshot

Overall a silly waste of time, let alone 5.99 on Amazon.

The falling CGI effects or way too obvious out of the real word, but even so , I did liked that fighting scene, nicely done.Of course, it's a comic book put on screen, so don't expect to much.If there would be to compare it to failure from this same universe, I would say Bloodshot is way better than Captain Marvel.",Bloodshot

When it comes to big budget action movies the only thing the makers need to get right is the entertainment factor; Transformers, Pacific Rim, Fast and Furious, etc. Is better acting, a solid script, good editing, etc. improbable? Absolutely not, but films like these aren't geared toward any other audience besides the high octane ones, specifically here, the sci-fi video game/comic book fans.This film gives off Deus Ex Human Revolution vibes which makes me want to see a film or TV series about the game!

459,billyirawan-13727,"Well Director, you made a huge mistake for just one thing. Vin Diesel...",3,27 April 2020,"I'm surprised about this movie at first. It is a superhero movie that I never heard about, but the trailer, concept, and CGI is good while not mentioning while not from Marvel or DC. But after watching it I know what is the feeling of ""This could be better if Ray Garrison do this or that"" but I realized it was Vin Diesel bad acting ruins it. First I will mention The Plus and Minus of this movie, then about why Vin Diesel is the mistake here:Plus:
The story kinda fresh for superhero movie. I never known Bloodshot, especially heroes outside Marvel/DC (Even Marvel/DC known from movie better than its comics because Japanese Manga and Korean Manhwa more famous in Indonesia). Not seeing its riding story from past superheroes movies (Like Captain Marvel, Spider-man Tom Holland, Black Panther or Dr. Strange that somehow I hated how they do that making the hero of the movie like weaker and not so strong as past heroes).Bloodshot power is like Deadpool, almost immortal but cooler because he's regeneration can be seen.The story about how his memory altered to make him a killing machine/Hitman is not the first, but executed in good way. Making him waking up shocked, not remember clearly, slowly remember, and reset him again. It's like respawning in video games while the quest always altered. I liked it.Wilfred Wigans is the one stealing the show. I'm just waiting for him to break the 4th wall about superheroes but not happening sadly.Slow-mo action while showing how his regenerate is truly cool. Certain CGI fight is suprisingly fun especially the neighborhood pursuing and elevator falling fights. It's look like transformers but in a good way.Minus:
Why it's called Bloodshot but Ray rarely called Bloodshot?Ray should have superhero outfit too. He's look so lame with long-sleeve and turtleneck. Or maybe because of Vin Diesel?KT relationship with Ray idk it's kinda shallow. Wigans relationship with Ray is more relevant than her. Not much KT flashback of Ray.Also if KT can beat up regular humans with only Baton that somehow more stronger than Vibranium, why didn't she rebel sooner? He can suddenly hit Harting hands and get away with it. Harting can't sense her betrayal so why she can kill him outright?If Wilfred Wigans so smart, how the Hell Harting doesn't find him first? Even shocked Eric using his open source code? It's somewhat ironic. Isn't Harting also the project coordinator that SHOULD know how his project created from in and out. At least known about source of his success is?Now the main problem. Vin Diesel:
Vin Diesel isn't a versatile actor. He's in category of The Rock, Batista, Arnold, Bruce Willis, etc actors that only good physically but not able to look good at drama, compelling act, sad, and ofc superhero. Batista can nail it because he played as goofy guy Drax, like the rest of cast i mentioned before that isn't rely on deep characters. If you think Dominic Torreto is deep, wow. He only feel deep because there's 8 to 10 movie that we almost always seen him. So we getting attached. As personality he's lesser than Brian, sadly Paul Walker left us so Dom become the main protagonist. Also don't count Groot, he only speak 1 line with slight variations.Vin Diesel can only play Cool-Goofy-Angry persona. The only movies this work is Pitch Black, A Man Apart, XXX, Pacifier and ofc Fast & Furious. Other than that he's always can fit with the main role and story. Look how bad Last Witch Hunter, Riddick other than Ptich Black, Babylon A.D., etc.Vin Diesel isn't fit as hero because he doesn't have that Zero to Hero feel. He's always presented as lvl 100 characters that can take anything. Bloodshot he's really bland. I can't feel his anger and confusion. Only his usual Cool-Goofy guy presented here, the character he bring from FF and XXX combined. I never feel Vin Diesel as different person each movies he stars in. Hell even his Angry acting better at FF8 than in this movie. Idk I'ts like he didn't take this movie seriously.Vin Diesel is aging, he still muscular but his age clearly shown here. Time to choose new blood or rising star. Also better actor than Vin Diesel.Bloodshot is a let-down. But mainly because of their choose Vin Diesel as their main protagonist.",Bloodshot
460,manicmick,A good action film,7,29 September 2020,"Lots of action, a couple of twists and a very good chance of a follow on or series.
Yes it's a bit cheesy but taking that into account, it's a great action film with some pretty good special effects. I would definitely watch a follow on.

463,zoe-anthony,High Octane Techy action,7,9 June 2020,"It was my choice of movie and I wanted something on a Saturday night where I did not have to think about anything. Bring on Vin Diesel and you know you are on to a winner, bring Eliza fresh from Fast and Furious and you have the eye candy, think I even had a girl crush on her.It was completely action-packed, a lot of fight scenes and I love the small role that Toby Kebbell played, he is gold in my eyes. The storyline itself was an interesting concept, but the bare bones is a revenge film but not necessarily the type you think it might be. People are pawns in a larger game, the end game greed. When events unfold, things did shock me, the betrayal and the time of betrayal were unreal, and at times a little bit unbelievable. The technology in this film was out of the world, it reminded me of the tech in The Sixth Day with my hero Arnie, but way more advanced. The idea of nanobots, helping to improve the human race is interesting and can be a bit worrying if anything like this EVER was to happen well if it was in the wrong hands anyway.High octane action is the must for me and that was a winner, it is a second to horrors. I do love a good scare but I also love a good action-packed violent film. (I think there might be something wrong with me!!) Has it been left open for a second film? Well, what do you think?",Bloodshot

I watched it thinking, ""Make this into a series and it'll blow Van Damme's Universal Soldier series out of the water."" That being said: there is one major oops that someone should have caught before the movie was released. Flour, when suspended in the air makes a major explosion. In the tunnel scene the first spark or shot should have ignited the flour and totally vapourised everything in the tunnel while blowing it out both ends.",Bloodshot

It was as though the director (or someone) decided we have to end this and bam the last scene was done. Not a really good transition as to what was actually happeneing or what they were going to be doing as the drove away into the sunset..
I thought that the movie itself was a good warning of 'science' in the 'wrong hands' and people who want power. I thought some of the action scenes were very good, especially the elevator fight, but I also found it took me a wee while to figure out what was actually happening, and I'm usually pretty quick with plots etc. I like Van Diesel, which is why I went, without any expectation, and it was pasable.",Bloodshot

I am sure that's how the story of this movie was written .The lead character is brain washed ( memory wiped and then new memory given ) to do the dirty work of the villain . This concept was lifted right out of ""Total Recall "" , albeit implemented in reverse for this movie . To get the job done, the villain recruits handpicked injured or dead soldiers from the US military , and then injects some sci fi mumbo jumbo juice into those soldiers turning them into Super Soldiers . This portion has been again lifted off "" Universal Soldier "" & "" Iron Man 3 "". Heck , Guy Pearce plays the evil scientist (villain) with the same modus operandi in both Iron Man 3 & Bloodshot .
And oh, the sci fi mumbo jumbo juice I mentioned before , were actually nanites ( nano robots ) in their billions . Didn't this stuff come from the movie 2009 movie , G.I. Joe : Rise of the Cobra ? . Yup, it did !

Marvel and DC have done really well (apart from Birds of Prey which I really hate), while Fox's Marvel isn't doing so hot. Which brings us to comic book films that aren't part of the MCU or the DCEU, it's just it's own film that sets up a new Cinematic Universe. I didn't like David Harbour's Hellboy, I thought it was a painful experience that tries to bring some fresh new start, but none succeeded. And there's Bloodshot with Vin Diesel... and oh dear, it was awful. Bloodshot is the worst film I've ever seen. All of the acting and the dialogue is embarrassing and uninteresting, the special effects are so bad that it makes Green Lantern's CGI realistically beautiful. I felt like I wanted to go to sleep, cause the entirety of the film is so boring! It's just another pointless edgy action film like Hellboy. The plot is really sloppy and just awful.

496,jon-22746,Just bad,2,19 December 2020,"Not even in the ""so bad it's good"" category. Silly and boring with awful dialogue, a stupid and obvious story, and the most inept editing and continuity I've seen in a while. The chase scene supposedly set on the streets of London is particularly terrible. Sadly, Vin who is always watchable, is strangely unlikeable in this film, and he's beginning to creek. Also if any proof is needed of the spectacular fall from grace of Guy Pearce, with more than a decade of terrible acting choices, then this is it.",Bloodshot
497,www-KZR,This movie was okay. The plot twist was pretty cool and the action scenes were nice...But vin diesel just never sells his roles to me.,6,16 March 2020,"SPOILERS BELOW :I read one or two of the Bloodshot comics and the movie gave Bloodshot more abilities than I remember the comic book character having. And the additional abilities are pretty cool in my opinion.The one thing I didn't like was (Here is the Spoiler) how at the end of the movie the super-hacker character does not explain why Bloodshot's nanobots no longer needs to be recharged. He just says, ""You no longer need to recharge your nanobots. I fixed that. You used to be a 3, but now you're an 18."" What?!? Don't do that! Don't just say, ""Hey Superman, while you were asleep I took care of your kryptonite problem. You used to be a 3, but now you're an 18."" That part seemed lame to me.The plot twist was cool. The fight scenes are cool. The special effects are cool. Guy Pearce does a great job as a villain - you really end up hating him. The cyborg tech looks great on the bad guys, but there was a few times they were able to take more damage than possible in order to keep the fight going. There is one scene where Vin Diesel looks a lot like the comic book character (without hair though).I'm looking forward to a sequel where (Spoiler Alert) someone is able to cancel out his nanobots with some disruption signal/tech so Bloodshot has to rely on his natural talents and mind to overcome tough obstacles/situations. He got shot with disruption tech in this movie, but he simply pulled it out and the disruption went away.",Bloodshot
498,ryanthecooper,A good bad movie,6,9 May 2020,"You have to go into something like this with realistic expectations. From the preview alone, you'll see that there's pretty much not one single original idea here, and it's an obvious clumsy mashup of Robocop and Transcendence.
Vin Diesel is definitely looking a bit frayed around the edges to play this character, but he's pretty much just there to give the lineup a bit of credibility as aside from Guy Pearce, it's clear that this is just a 'foot in the door"" for the rest of the cast.
Despite being a proverbial fruit salad of movie clichés, as well as very underwhelming attempts at plot twists, it's still watchable and well-polished.",Bloodshot

It genuinely baffles me that this man has ever been cast in a movie, let alone had such a successful career. I assume he must have some serious dirt on somebody high up in Hollywood (who hasn't already been exposed).
The trouble is all the movies he stars in are the sort of movies I love - brain dead action films - so every once in a while I watch one. Every time I am infuriated by how utterly awful he is as a leading man. Hopefully next time I will remember to give the film a miss.",Bloodshot

507,jacksonhimsham,"I love action films, and I loved it more.",6,31 March 2020,"This is just awesome as we talk about the action part, Vin Diesel was good, but the emotion factor was missing from the screenplay and that made it a little weak when it comes to a good storyline. It reminisces me of Transcendence by Wally Pfister as it also used this concept of nanomites, nano-materials, that transcends your body and uplifts your whole existence to another level. Whereas Transcendence revolved around betterment of the world and had much of the emotional sense to it, Bloodshot really missed that and lacked there. But as I said, I love action films and this was it. Boom, breathtaking from Sony, another action filled drive after Venom and it seems like, I don't know it feels a little spooky, it's like a feeling that Sony is working on things like this but who knows.

510,cn-11941,Gave Diesel a second chance... I was Right all the time,4,14 March 2020,"I simply run from Vin Diesel movies. F&F, XXX among other from this walking expressionless door they call an actor. Why? Because Vin Diesel's characters are all the same and they dont make any sense at all.
Bloodshot was somekind of Robocop with Dredd... if booth were written by a desfunctional 15 year old boy with drug abuse. Okay, Robocop isn't that reference of perfect plot and development, but it was okay.
This one here, however, we can't take no advantage from. The plot is Just a compilation of Hollywood action movies clichés from start to finish. The redemption of a A-Class American soldier who has no Family, no Friends, no one to miss him, so, thank that he has nothing to loose when te gets enhanced after death by a megalomaniac scientist who controls the movie heroe's every step. I mean...really?? Hollywood screenwriters have nothing left to come up with?? Thats sad at least.
Special and visual effects are full of failures . The CGI is mediocre (to save adjectives). The sound mixing and editing was poorly developed, we dont feel the imerssion we should expect from a high action movie.
Bloodshot saves himself for having a little bit more of 100 minutes length. More than that and I would certainly commmit suicide if Vin Diesel came with another super hero (una) effective quote.
This movie is a total disgrace, please, dont loose your time or Money.",Bloodshot
511,xenephatx,why use science fiction if you have no intrest in it?,4,28 March 2020,A child would have made less mistakes. the science fiction in this film was obviously put together by someone that doesn't realize it needs to actually be tied into real science or at least be slightly believable. it all falls apart at the slightest scrutiny.,Bloodshot
512,clsrocks,Nanites Rock! Psycho Killer!,7,8 March 2020,"I got introduced to Valiant comics two years ago, when I bought my fist Bloodshot by Duane Swirzeyinski. At first I thought - hey they clubbed Wolverine and Punisher together! But the character is so much more that, at least what they do with him in the subsequent runs by Jeff Lemiere. Rellay cool if you are into comics. So I was super hyped when they announced the movie. Even more when I heard Vinnie D was playing him. I have been a long time Vinnie D fan. XXX and FF 1 and Riddick are great movies. The sequels maybe not so much but they ain't bad by any means.
The trailers looked good but they didn't have him in his OG comic book look so I was a bit concerned. However, I could imagine that would have required a a lot of make up / CG which probably they did not have the budget for.Having given all this context lets get into the movie review.By no means is this is a bad movie, it was pretty entertaining popcorn blockbuster. Will critics be rooting for it , will it get 98% rotten tomatoes score? Probably not.
But I guess the movie makers were never aiming for that. Its more for the audience to have a good time. That Bloodshot achieves in my opinion.So let me break it down in what I liked and what I did not in a well ...To 7 list .(I wanna be different !)Good stuff:1. That robot girl from westworld who was married to Elon Musk .UK Actress Talulah Riley was cool.
2. Indian IT guy , who has some good funny lines
3. Guy Pearce , sells the mad scientist type role he had in IM3
4. Eiza Gonzalez , always awesome to see her on a screen even though in smaller roles
5. Vinnie D as Bloodshot
6. The Henchmen were also pretty cool
7. Oh Of course the action made better by Steve Jablonsky (transformers) soundtrack !
Bad stuff:1. Bad editing in some scenes with action and chases
2.Not direct adaptation of comics (I guess this is still ok, they don't need to do panel by panel everything)
3.OG Comics look And costume not used
4. A generic action movie feel. They should have gone with some of the complex comic storylines
5.ninjak vs Valiant universe movie did a better job in comics accurate bloodshot portrayal. guy who played tommy in power rangers played Bloodshot
6. No easter eggs or nods to outside valiant universe. Again not necessary but would have been fun!
7. Toby Kebell wasted completely
To conclude, If your not familiar with the character, you may enjoy it as another generic action movie. If your a Vinnie D fan, you will walk out happy. If you are a big time comic fan of the Valiant Universe then you will have a good time as this was the first big time appearance of Bloodshot. I never thought in my life we would get a Bloodshot movie!",Bloodshot

Toss in some decent, sometimes video gamey CGI, and a few very serviceable performances by the supporting cast for a fun action flick.

A better choice and I think it would have worked better was the story of XO Manowar! I am sure Vin would have had a lot more fun with that character and it think it would have been a more commercially successful movie. Spider Aliens kidnap a Visigoth from ancient history to use as a slave or food on their space ship and he travels through time working until he finds their most lethal weapon XO armor.

How could you enjoy any movie with a mindset like that?? Trust me and every other confused person in the reviews when I say that this movie isn't an Oscar winner or anything, but it sure as hell isn't bad, or even somewhat bad. It's a good action movie with a good plot and very good cgi. It's sad to see all this effort and money get shamed for no apparent reason.

What ever you do, DONT TRUST THE HIGH REVIEWS!!!! 5.7 is far too high for such rubbish, you had a wonderful source material that went out the window, anyone going on about the tunnel scene, that scene is all of about 10 minutes at best, and even then, its really not that great, if you seen the trailer, you've seen the scene!!!!",Bloodshot

Ultimately realizing that Valiant was the creator of my favorite books, so I might be a little biased in my excitement to see Bloodshot come to life on screen. That being said, this movie was a refreshing change of pace from other comic book based movies. I'm really hoping for an X-O Manawar movie... Fingers crossed!!

The flaunting of KT's beauty is too obvious and distracting, but I'm sure the men enjoy it and that's the purpose for it. I mean, I spent $20 on this just because of Heughan's presence, so I get it.
Overall, this isn't a great movie. The characters aren't developed enough, the dialogue isn't all that well written, the action scenes to me were mostly meh, the story was rushed. I enjoyed the 6"" jokes and the characters Dalton and Wigans. I would have liked to have more of Dalton and Tibbs, to get to know them better.

594,maximusthemerciful,Poorly Organized Homage to Recycled Cliches With Detrimental Reliance on Poor CGI and Too Much Slo-Mo,4,29 March 2020,"""Bloodshot"" is the proverbial Frankenstein of a filmmaker's favorite parts of iconic science fiction and action films poorly stitched together. Vin Diesel plays Ray, a deceased U.S. soldier whose body is transformed into a billion-dollar weapon by a biotech CEO Dr. Harting (Guy Pearce) seeking to make billions in the military sector off of ""nanites,"" a network of microscopic machines that heal Ray instantly from bullets and explosions, provide him with superhuman strength, and can hack into any online database to provide Ray with whatever information he needs (like learning how to fly a private jet in a few seconds (The Matrix, anyone?)).The movie is interesting until the first overdone twist is revealed: Ray is nothing more than a human cyborg assassin (*cough* Terminator) which Harting programs to experience a fabricated virtual reality in which Ray's wife is murdered in front of him, Ray is then also killed by the same man, wakes up in Harting's lab, then (in spectacularly cheesy CGI fashion and frustratingly-overused slow-motion sequences) pursues and kills his murderer. Harting then recovers Ray, wipes his memory clean, and reloads the same simulation but changes the face of the ""murderer"" to whatever innocent soul the evil Harting next wants dead. No surprise, it's his business partners so he can take all the $$$ and power. Harting has a crew of other cybernetically enhanced soldiers that he makes deliver the same scripted lines and actions every time he resets Ray (think Truman Show but with way less believable actors).From there, the movie loses its identity and, along with it, its intrigue. It is unsure whether it wants to be a lighthearted action romp with a sexy femme fatale and a black actor who is formulaically lovable because he's (1) a stereotypical programming nerd, (2) has a disarming British accent, and (3) constantly trying too hard to provide comic relief that never lands...or whether it wants to be taken seriously as a high-octane thriller.The result is a schizophrenic mess of parading one tired cliché after another as Ray learns the truth about his reality and rebels against his creator/captor (The Matrix/Westworld/Blade Runner/Ex Machina/every science fiction movie ever).I enjoy Diesel's Dominic Toretto and Riddick characters more than most, but this time he is unable to escape the typecast and bring any depth, humanity, or likeability to Ray. All other actors seem to be phoning it in, too, except for Pearce whose character is a refreshingly toned-down, levelheaded villain. But he's not enough to save this wandering plot with forgettable action scenes and nonexistent character development, whose attempt to be everything all at once results in it being a whole lot of nothing. You can leave your brain on the shelf for this one.",Bloodshot

Also, I'm pretty critical when it comes to filmography, and there were a few genius moments that created some interesting scenes (action sequences in flour - who would have thought?). This film also brought up the moral implications of psychologically manipulating soldiers.In actuality, there were only a few problems. For example, where is Bloodshot's place in the world & what makes him a ""superhero"" if he is only trying to save himself. Also, there could have been a little more connection between the characters themselves, although it does leave room for development in the next film (assuming there is one).I would even say that people who say this movie is terrible are just upset it isn't Marvel/DC or they're familiar with the original comics & are basing their judgment off of those or they're just Vin Diesel haters.Overall, the film is worth at least one watch.",Bloodshot

The nanite CGI was so fucking cool. There's a shot where half his face gets blown off and then reaches in slow motion - epic. Oh, and of course when we first witness the healing technology after Dr. Harting cut Ray's palm!I really liked the concept behind KT's breathaliser. It was an especially satisfying payoff when she was smoking the joint that rendered Wilfred unconscious. I was just like YESS when I realised what was going on.The fight scene in the tunnel was so brilliantly done. I was on edge and fully immersed in the phenomenal action sequences.THAT twist was so well-executed. It could have been a sloppy, half-assed attempt at a twist, but was instead quite confronting. The attention to detail and small, little hints were also nice. The foreshadowing was so rewarding in the BIG reveal.A big question that foreshadowed the film was, how long has he been 'dead' for. For me, It was kinda predictable that his relationship with Gina was smoke-and-mirrors. However, she did provide the information that he had been deceived for 5 years! No wonder KT felt bad for him.When the first villain entered and danced to a dramatic song playing in the background, I vividly remember thinking: ""Lex Luthor in Batman V Superman!"" So when Dr. Harting was criticising the tech-guy for blatantly ripping off every cliche film villain entrance, I couldn't help but chuckle.The movie also gave me some strong ""Alita: Battle Angel"" vibes! Espeacially during the chase scene with the one guy who had the metal legs and the other who used ocular drones to see.Quite good / Interesting concept or execution / Evoking",Bloodshot

He is a US soldier that was relentless and determined to complete his mission. He has some characteristics of a cross between Wolverine and The Punisher. Like Wolverine, Bloodshot is a soldier who went through genetic enhancement, and in Bloodshot's case, it is in the form of nano technology that gives him the ability to instantly heal and super strength. Like The Punisher, Bloodshot has the tactical training to take down an entire security team without breaking a sweat. But the name Bloodshot was not suitable for the character; I would have been more content with another name for him.The story was fantastic, and it was not too much. The trailers made it seem like Bloodshot would have his memory erased more times than what actually happened. I liked this better because it essentially was not frequently resetting the story. The entire movie was action packed, and it was fulfilling to get more of that than anticipated.RST, the company that developed Bloodshot, had an interesting take on who they had. Each member was scientifically modified and enhanced. My favorite was the character Jimmy Dalton. He an enhanced soldier with two prosthetic legs and has super speed. His chase against Bloodshot had me on the edge of my seat and it surpassed any of my expectations.Dr. Emil Harting (played by Guy Pearce) was an almost exact replica of Pearce's role as Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3. I like Pearce as an actor, but I wish the producers, directors, and creators of Bloodshot had a better developed character for Dr. Harting.

I would like to make some points......
1.plot:I don't like to say it's plot is extraordinary or full of twist...but it's good.well it have some flaws like character build up was nt up to mark like dat of Eliza gonzalez.back history was not satisfactory.end of guy Pierce can be more than just a blast.but it has some turn ND twist like so many Hollywood movies with a score of 6.5 ND above
2.acting:some would say vin dizel is monotonous ND doing the same type charecter over ND over again.but I guess he is doing what he is good at with a less taking ND more kicking.eliza was superb but she was made with less fighting involvement.others are good may be nt so much.
3.graphics:it's a area they should be good.i was also bit of disappointed.with Sony ND a big budget,I was hoping more.i wouldn't say it was utterly bad.they did try ND concept was good but visuals were clearly not convincing.last fighting scene was good though.
So it's a movie u will enjoy for a time I can say day...but I guess it's not a movie u will want to see over ND over againg.we were a movie like venom dis time but Sony shot a bloodshot to our heart dis time!!!",Bloodshot

This movie is one of the best action movies I've seen. Constant rush, wicked story, and come on, Vin Diesel is just RIDDICK in everything I watch with him so RIDDICK did a great acting job here and omg the graphics and fight scenes. I can only day one thing. Remember when you saw Neo fall back slow motion avoiding bullets and such? Just wait. Watch these scenes its more than bullets flying....its bodies and everything else. Scenes SLOW down to give you wicked up close moves and shots. It's a wonder to the eyes to watch this. Now!!

My personal tough is that MR. Diesel have been way overused in the fast and the furious movies, so it was nice to see him in a total different movie.
Overall the movie is some what your classical high tech action movies, but it sticks, and you can probably see it a few times and enjoy it.
My only take is that I got this Call of duty: Advanced warfare vibe of it (Like overlord and Call of duty zombie mode).
I don't know but I got a COD: AW Vibe of it. You will also get a feeling of you have seen this movie before, but hey it got Vin Diesel in it so it's good enough to watch.
Never red the comic either, But for once I want to read it. The movie will probably be not like the comic as other comic related movies, but I felt I could watch this Movie without reading the comic first like with Anime/Manga comics.",Bloodshot

His character in that movie was also responsible for the betrayal and imprisonment of the protagonist - I think it was why he was chosen for the role in this movie. I also noticed how there were references to God and Jesus.

Other movies can be obvious but still bring taste to it all. This was an attempt to make a ""cool"" movie. You can't make something cool if that is your goal. A movie is good if there is passion in the actions the characters take. An example of a similar passion can the be John Wick. He is motivated from the death of his dog. ""Its just a dog"" well his love gave him the dog which makes it so much more valuable. In stark contrast, this ""bloodshot"" movie has the main character use his passion against him. And then he aims his gun at the guy doing this? Predictable since BEFORE i watched it. BEFORE it was released. Now, do not get me started on the computer generated scenes. The fights felt like pre 2013 type quality. Shall i speak about the cast? They seemed handpicked by amateurs. I wouldnt say the acting was good but id say they weren't right for the type of movie this was.In conclusion, this movie was born from the wishtk make something cool.

The police inside have a British accent but the car looked to be of the Australian variety (but defo not UK). The production team also didn't bother to change the licence plates on any of the vehicles. They are all foreign. I don't know where they were from but it wasn't the UK.

During the second act of the film Vin travels to England to assassinate one of his targets, once this is completed he attempts to escape the control that rst has on him causing them to send to soldiers to assassinate vin himself. This scene is supposed to take place in Soho London. This does not take place in cold dark grey London streets. It's been filmed in South Africa I think, blazing sun, tin roofed houses, SA registration plates on cars, definitely NOT LONDON!
So as soon as I realized this as I was watching, it totally removed me from the scene just irritating me that they hadn't even tried to dress it to look like London.
I understand it's not always possible to film in the desired city due to budget etc, but at least try to make it look like where it is!
With all the money spent on this movie you think they could have cgi'd London in or at least put the correct reg plates on the vehicles. Good film ruined by bad continuity",Bloodshot

I know the famous of Vin Diesel. Teaser Trailer Good + not spoil all the hint like Hobb & Shaw. So I have a average level of hope. I don't have high hype but I still think Vin choiced a good film to act.
CCG, action: all of film and very very good. I will rate 9/10 point for cast, act both action...music
The story: I think I short something to perfect. Like other user said: this film make a feel like 2000-2010 film, superhero 2000, or just for action, fight... I'm Agreed
But it is fiction and action movie. so If say it made for entertainment, fire, fight, boom... well it good.
Stories is go fast and short more stories of each person. Specially to Vin (Ray) and Her (Katte aka K.T) I only need a more sacrify of 2 character... and I think the story of character like you said need to be. need it to be perfect for you, and don;t have it = 1-5 point. is not Fair. It just need take slow, more touching, with me, it enough.

Maybe it's because I dream like Ray does- supremely realistic and unable to tell the difference between reality and fantasy.I loved the movie. It brought new awareness to my own mind. It made me think I knew what was going on, but I actually had no idea.... then when I found out what I thought was real, wasn't.It was fantastic - and the awesome action scenes and bassassery of Vin Diesel just added to it.Two thumbs up.

A girl gets on a seat in the cinema and watches.Here's the thing, much to my surprise, I actually enjoyed the movie - a lot! Yes, we can argue ""But it's a typical Vin Diesel movie"" ( Which it is) but let's just break it downFirst: The CGI is great! Impressed me a lot! The attention to detail was truly amazing -even if it felt a little *The Matrix* in partsThe stunts were good, the fight scenes were great and the cast worked together well. There was some comedy thrown in for good measure and some decent one liners that made me laugh.Secondly: I thoroughly enjoyed Sam Heughan's character - Jimmy Dalton.

743,ajhoskins-07268,Boring and typical,2,13 March 2020,"Bloodshot just didn't feel connected. The movie seemed to jump from scene to scene and introduce character after character with no regards to the story. The action looks okay, passable for modern CGI, but it feels so generic and reminds me of movies like Taken 3, etc. Tack on a generic chase scene in Italy, motorcycle and everything.
The pacing in this movie is terrible, jumping from Macedonia, to Italy, to another place in Italy, to a lab, back to Italy, etc. It went from talking to action and back and forth with no regards for plot or development. Think of the typical movie, with exposition, rising action, etc., and this movie does none of it. There's a resolution and action scenes. It feels like they cut out important parts just to get to more action.
A further embarrassment is the female representation in this movie. I'm not saying this movie had to have any strong female characters or leads, but this one tried and failed. The only reason his wife existed was to get ""killed"" and turn him into a soldier, and later was found alive and to have moved on (also this scene immediately and jarringly cuts to an action scene).
The female lead has some boring character development no thanks to Vin Diesel's very emotional acting. She is only really there to be hot, look cool in some scenes and complement Vin Diesel's character. There was surprisingly not a forced romance, though it seemed hinted (There was odd scene near the ""dead wife"" scene where the female lead is swimming in a pool, and they get the typical Hollywood shots of her in her swimsuit.
SPOILERS AHEAD
The male hacker dude is just there as comedic relief, guards are there just to be stupid cannon fodder. The wife-killers are killed in 5 minutes, and the main baddie is killed in a very generic scene where you think Vin Diesel's going to die, but he pulls out a grenade and kills himself and the main bad guy, but nope, hacker dude resurrects Vin Diesel, making the sacrifice seem meaningless (as if it had any meaning anyway).
All humor in this movie just bounces off Vin Diesel. It's like people are making jokes to the audience, not to each other. Hacker dude is the best character in this movie, only because he's a little funny.
Overall, I would not go to see this again, I regret seeing it the first time. I had low expectations and was still disappointed at how boring and bad it felt. My favorite scene was when the female lead extends a baton into a merc's face, and that knocks him out.",Bloodshot
744,rowen-69171,That tunnel scene!!,8,13 March 2020,"Listen, no one says Vin Diesel is an Oscar winning actor, but no one can dispute the fact the man can carry an action franchise. This movie has several mixed, old school, action formula tropes-RoboCop, Terminator, the Six Million Dollar Man...the list is endless. But goddammit those old tried & true tropes WORK! The director, David S.F. Wilson, apparently has a background in visual effects & it shows. The scene I can't go on enough about is that goddamned tunnel scene. That is visually stunning. A breathtaking, heart stopping, edge of your seat, mind blown action scene that I can't get out of my mind. The bad reviews keep complaining about ""bad cgi"" well that's bs, cuz that tunnel scene is pristine.The other characters include Guy Pierce in the lead antagonist role, his role is actually not that big, it's fairly predictable but well acted. Eiza Gonzalez plays KT, the obvious future love interest who starts off sketchy but redeems herself, also acted well. Sam Heughan is the biggest surprise as angry bad boy Jimmy Dalton. He's got a HUGE chip on his shoulder & takes it out on Diesel's character. Heughan takes the biggest departure from his normal roles here playing the bad boy. He's great, he's cocky, over confident, angry. He has a heavy Scots accent in real life but pulls off American pretty decently. The best supporting character is Lamorne Morris as Wilford Wigans, a coder with a great sense of humor. Think Don Cheadle in the Ocean's movies. He's a scene stealer.This Valiant Comic based movie (read the source comics, they're great) is an amalgamation if different action themes but it's good! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, my 25 year old son loved it, and it deserves a franchise. It sucks that it got released just as the Covid 19 pandemic blew up, but hopefully people will see it.",Bloodshot

750,joan-23913,Definitely worth seeing,8,15 March 2020,"Bloodshot was a very electrifying movie from start ro finish. You are pulled into the story very quickly with a dramatic opening. Performances by Vin Diesel & Eiza Gonzolez & Gut Pierce are very good as the main chatacters. Would have liked to see more character development of 2 other rebuilt soldiers ie Tibbs and Dalton. Liked both but wanted more involvement from these 2 in the storyline. But regardless, Bloodshot does not disappoint or leave you much time for reflection on these matters, as it is non stop action & excitement. The fight scene at the end of movie between Tibbs, Dalton, Ray & to a lesser extent Guy, leaves you breathless to say the least. Would love to see more sequels to see where the story goes. Love the message of the story re man's fate of possibly becoming very manipulated by technology as these soldiers are. Who knows where 5G may take us in this regard. As a woman, I, of course, would like to see more romantic interests, more insight into Tibbs & Daltons abilities & purpose to RST. Both actors very good looking & capable but underused in my humble opinion. Loved this movies stoeyline, direction,acting, CGI, music (psycho killer, Memories Are Made of This, etc), editing, costumes & choreography (KT's underwater performance, Dalton & Ray's fight scene). Deserves to be seen on the big screen. Will definitely see this movie a second time.",Bloodshot

The story line is genuinely interesting and full of plots twists. Coming into see the film with no expectations I thought the bad reviews were because it was the typical pro US army/man needs to save wife film but that notion was completely overturned.
It has solid an exciting action scenes which are very well choreographed and the shows off some of the best cgi sequence I've come across for a long time that put higher budget films to shame (looking at you black panther).

753,joshuamscofield,"Lame Action, Bad Acting, Flat Characters",3,27 March 2020,"Bloodshot migth have been a much better film than it is. There are many hurdles that the film comes within a hair of clearing. Audiences have been spoiled by the stunning CGI found in othe rmajor actions films, such as those produced by Marvel, and are likely to find the effects in this movie half-baked or clunky. Scenes that might have been passable a few years ago now seem gummy and rendered. The story is generic and forgettable, as are the characters. A surprisingly twisty plot provides some stimulation for viewers, but ultimately fails to rescue an otherwise bland attempt at the once fertile genere of the action-thirller revenge fantasy. The film's trailers promise high-octane, intense action sequences that might have at least provided a bit of spectacle for moviegoers looking for a beer-and-pretzels escape from current worries about Covid-19, and perhaps on this front the movie does deliver. There are certaintly worse ways to spend and evening. But the over use of slow motion and forgetable PG violence lead me to say that the film is not worth the price of a movie ticket. If you're interested in watching Vinn Diesel and his costars play through an admitedly entertaining series of silly, but fun interactions, and you don't mind putting up with a potentially obnoxious amount of military reverence, then Bloodshot might be worth the couple bucks it takes to rent when it becomes available on streaming services, or other rental platforms. In the end, a lackluster movie can still be a lot of fun with a few good friends. In such cases, Bloodshot might make a fun comedy that the whole family can enjoy.",Bloodshot

761,emmapost-83450,Needs more positive reviews.,10,6 May 2020,"The movie had excellent cinematography, and each shot was dynamic as hell.
Even the scenes in the beginning that felt like a series of short clips or trailers, that felt like sloppy story telling, and felt somewhat off-putting, which gave the character the motivation he needed to get revenge made sense once we find out that it's all fabricated, and if you look at it that way the beginning isn't so off-putting anymore, and it rather feels necessary. The design of the movie was pretty epic, at one point half of his entire face gets blown off and he resumes firing his gun at his target before the Nanites even reassemble his face and ear. Not to mention how awesome the design of the Nanites are themselves. Vin's participation in the stunts made the experience more enjoyable as well because it didn't feel overwhelmingly augmented, and the shots felt like he was actually breaking those guy's bones.
It's not an Oscar movie for sure, but it doesn't seem like that's what they were trying to achieve. They just made a bad ass movie, with a lot of details backing it. Let me put it this way, if you don't come into the movie with a certain level of participation, and understand the effort of the actors, and the people on set, then you probably won't enjoy this movie. Just have an open mind, and look at the broader scope of the film. Hopefully there will be a sequel of some-sort.",Bloodshot

Almost all the rest.
Things that they have, just poorly done. Kicking an SUV will not have it spin in circles on a center axis. The heavy part is the front, and will be the fulcrum. And when you jump through a window onto a roof top...but suddenly are skidding to a stop on a city street? Come on...The story was okay...but barely. Had more potential, and not enough development.Sam Heughan. Where Alex excelled, Sam was pretty painful to watch at times.The Rest?
Guy Pearce. I WANT to like him, but his acting is as stagnant as anything. His acting was pretty much the Mandarin from Iron Man...maybe worse.
Vin Diesel. Ever since Fast & Furious 1, all his other roles have been as ""Dom"". This movie, he is essentially ""Dom"" with nanites. While I would like to see more range, he excels at Dom...and maybe chooses the scripts that lets him be that person.",Bloodshot

It was a great bit of action, excellent visuals capturing Bloodshot and the technology behind him and a solid story, with quality acting for what it is, a movie based off of a comic. It was not as campy as Marvel tends to be and not as Dark as DC(not taking anything away from either of them) just saying, IMO, this was nicely placed in the middle.Also, the effects in this movie are way better than most these reviews give credit for and also this story was not as predictable as the haters said.

However...
Half way through the movie, Ray (Vin Diesel) finds himself in London to talk to a significant person. Immediately afterwards, he's involved in a chase scene which is absolutely NOT in London. He runs through alleyways in glorious sunshine. There are ornate, accessible rooftops; and the vehicles are clearly not in Britain; they have South African plates!
To anyone who doesn't know the difference, it makes no difference. But for me it was a huge distraction that took my mind off the movie's plot and progress. It felt like I'd been teleported from London to Cape Town with no explanation, with no idea what just happened. I thought I'd somehow nodded off and missed a significant part of the film, and Ray had magically traversed the globe. HOW does a $40,000,000 movie make such stupid mistakes?
Attention to detail is what makes a movie that bit better; in that, they have failed to epic proportions. Otherwise, it's a genuinely enjoyable watch, but this annoyed me so much that I created an IMDB account just to moan about it. Like us Brits do.",Bloodshot

They didn't even try to hide the fact it wasn't london at all, and for a moment thought I'd missed a bit of the movie as I couldn't work out why they were back in the states, the cars had California number plates even in the close up shots, and it was very sunny, so not UK 😀 But hey they saved a few squid keeping film locations local.",Bloodshot
819,eloy_lion,Very underrated on IMDB,10,7 November 2020,"This movie really deserves more support and a higher rating than it has now.That's all and I rest my case there. Just sort on reviews that rate high and see why they like it, if you like it from text than give it a go.I like Vin Diesel in movies, and now I even want to rewatch the F2F franchise again. That said, he really fits the role.",Bloodshot
820,urban-eksvard,Ok Vin Diesel movie.,7,15 March 2020,"Does the trick, with gadgets and acting. I like the group of actors, and even though nothing may be unique in the sci-fi I had fun and was entertained. There are some twists and turns that keep the story interesting throughout the length of the movie, and I could see myself watch another one if there's a sequel.",Bloodshot

It seems nowadays sci fi pick ups are slowing down.Though is somehow unrealistic well you cant put that aside since is an action sci /fi genre .Did enjoyed the last scenes .Hoping more from Vin and Eiza Gonzalez ,they had a nice display.So far i hear people giving it thumbs up. Well A good movie though.",Bloodshot
823,ttahincioglu,Extremely cliché and predictable,5,22 April 2020,"You can add this movie to the ""watchmojo: movies that ruined the movie"" list because it was such a giveaway that they let you watch the last scene!I also feel like i am bloodshot with all these movies being the same with little detail changes.With all the cgi and cast they could have done a better job with the script.

826,zmgriffiths,Predictable from the start,6,31 March 2020,"I've never written a movie review before but after watching this film, I just feel so let down. It felt like this was a mix of several well known movies, with all the best bits mixed together...but very poorly. The story line just had one obvious act after another. But the biggest let down was the major mistakes of all the London scenes..... wrong buildings, wrong road markings, wrong cars and most obviously were the number plates. None of these mistakes were subtle, and it went of for a good 20 minutes of the movie. Liked the humour in the movie though, sorry but Mr Diesel put this one behind you, your acting is the only great thing about this movie.",Bloodshot
827,jchilelli,Really well done ..,10,15 March 2020,A comic book movie that actually shows the human being the heroes and villains. You could tell from the first minutes that it was a different kind of action movie and it was incredibly entertaining throughout.,Bloodshot

831,IluvBrary,Predictable but good-looking,8,11 March 2020,"I enjoyed the movie. The story was very predictable, but it looked really good and it was entertaining. The only character that I got really curious about though was Jimmy Dalton (Sam Heughan) and I thought he was sadly underused. Eiza was beautiful and Vin was typical Vin. Not bad, but not brilliant either. Good enough for an entertaining evening at the movies. I have to agree with those, who said the trailor gave too much away. It definitely did.",Bloodshot

833,atticus-85287,Loved it!,10,14 March 2020,Saw Bloodshot on Thursday on IMAX. Loved all the twists and turns. The movie is visually stunning. Eiza Gonzalez as KT was fantastic and shows woman can get things done. Vin Diesel met his match up against Sam Heughan as Jimmy Dalton. Sam Heughan's scenes as wise cracking Dalton taunting Vin Diesels character was especially great. Sam Heughan has star power and Sony needs to do a prequel on Jimmy Dalton. Sam Heughan could do a stand alone film easily. Lemorne Morris is very funny. Hoping there will be a sequel that must include the cast including Sam Heughan. Planning on going to see again & taking nephews who like me love the Bloodshot comics.,Bloodshot
834,smokeandmirrors-54823,Memento for the new generation,9,7 November 2020,"Loved the action in this movie! I always love movies with Vin Diesel and Guy Pierce. One of my all time favorites is Memento. I love how this movie not only follows a similar premise, but also features Guy Pierce as the antagonist instead of the protagonist! If it was done on purpose, well done! If not, then these two movies should be watched back to back because Bloodshot could almost be a sequal.",Bloodshot

If the movie turn out what the actual comes to mind we enjoy it, but unexpected happens to the better side we overwhelm but here the unexpected happened to the reverse side and then everything you know what will happen, it's not about the pre prediction that kill the mood but it doesn't have anything rather than some same kind of actions",Bloodshot
837,aristitzer,Good movie,8,16 March 2020,"So I'm not sure why there's so much hate for this movie so far.... I was a big fan of the comics and I think this is a very good start to start off the Valiant cinematic universe. It's a comic book action movie. Has some fun action scenes and goes into his ""powers "" fairly well, it's almost like it's an origins story or something.... I will say that there's a particular scene that the cgi could have been better but it's still not as bad as the end Black Panther cgi.. I would say that if you are into sci-fi anti-hero action movies then you should enjoy this movie.",Bloodshot

Did I mention that it was awful? CGI doesn't make a film all on its own. It's like a 10 year old has watched a few action films and attempted to write his own. The clichés are laughable.

Picking are often slim, and I considered this after only having exhausted many of the slimmest.I was blown away. The story is smart, and it's beautifully shot. Vin, whom I admittedly found to be the biggest bar to entry, was perfectly suited for the role, and really applied himself.A satisfying action thriller that I will be adding to my collection.",Bloodshot
844,russthewomble,Average action film,3,29 October 2021,"Contains a lot of the regular action film tropes which make it a passable watch. I'd usually give it a 5/10 or so.But the location filming for scenes in 'London' are some of the worst location scouting/location decisions I've ever seen in a film. Why even call it London? The only reason they are in London in the first place is to track someone down, not because of any landmarks etc. Just say it's Cape Town or somewhere more suitable! Honestly ruined the film for me. So an average action film gets dragged down by some dreadful decision making that ruins the immersion.",Bloodshot
845,reif-89814,Better than you might think,8,13 June 2020,"I agree with the minority here. Bloodshot is a decent science fiction movie based on a comic book. It is not Marvel or DC. It is entertaining and some of the videography is very stylized and beautiful.Face it, to like sci-fi flicks, you have to suspend disbelief. You must suspend disbelief to watch and like this movie just as you do when you watch Star Wars, Star Trek, Lord of the Rings or any of the Marvel/DC movies. If Deadpool can do what he does, why can't Vin Disel's character do what he does knowing the tech he's been infused with?Bloodshot is an entertaining movie that should hit the sweet spot for audiences of sci-fi/fantasy genre's because it is PG-13 and more suitable for more people of all ages than many R-rated movies. Just watch and escape to enjoy!",Bloodshot

852,bucureancatalin,Better than expected,6,3 May 2020,"Even tough i didn't saw the trailer or knew anything about the source material i knew where the story was heading being you'r typical super hero/anti hero origin story, but on the same note i actually enjoyed it more than i would have expected. Like i Said the story is nothing new for someone used to Hero origins but it also feels rushed in some places. Action scenes are good, some of the best slow motion scenes i've seen recently. Likeble characters, surprisingly i found vin diesel's style suitable to this kind of character.
Conclusion, worth watching if you enjoy super hero movies",Bloodshot
853,gdhx,Good action but wanting storyline,4,15 March 2020,"The CGI and action scenes were great, but there were a few holes in the story that made it confusing. Kudos to Sam Heughan (Jimmy Dalton) who plays a very convincing angry bad guy, so different from his other roles, particularly Jamie Fraser in Outlander. It's a scene-stealing role for him that further displays the depth of his acting abilities.",Bloodshot

There is in no way shape or form this movie should be rated ANYTHING above a 6.5 here unless you have no standards.A very generic action movie with basically nothing that stands out. There is nothing original, thought provoking, impressive or special about it.A turn off your brain and watch *some* decent action and visuals type of movie.There is a place for movies like this of course, they serve their purpose but do not believe this is a 10 movie.
PEOPLE THAT RATE THIS A 10 ARE OUT OF THEIR MINDS , HAVE NEVER ACTUALLY SEEN A GREAT MOVIE, or ARE JUST TRYING TO BRING THE AVERAGE BACK UP SINCE MANY PEOPLE RATED IT LOW.",Bloodshot

A RANT WILL START THIS OFF..I dont know about you but I for one am sick of people being so serious with their reviews and picking everything apart in certain films. While at the same time praising films that absolutely suck ass and are trash LOL.Look what did you expect from this film when you saw the trailer? A bald guy with muscles that's been augmented to kick ass? Then praise be to the high because that's what your gonna get hahaha! I read some of these reviews before buying this film and they almost convinced me not to, boy I'm glad I didnt get sucked into their cosmic black hole of joylessness.I mean give us a break you other reviewers you take it all so serious when in reality the average person just wants a good simple film to escape reality with. Not every film needs X amount of layers to it so you spend all night doing mathmatical equations just to figure out ""OH! He was that kids dad."" LOL. Most of the time we just need a face value film for easy entertainment.All I gotta say is Vin kicks ass in this film like his other films, there is super cool technology advancement uses in the film obviously and if you dont like watching a beast of a man beat people up then dont watch the film and dont hate on it for being what it is.P.S. So maybe the whole thing was a rant LMAO! Enjoy the film!!",Bloodshot

861,kazorees,Just Silly,1,29 March 2020,"This film would be would better if they had not been so hilariously careless with the location details. Most of the time they are in ""London, England"", but it's clearly LA and looks nothing like anywhere in the England. There is a chase on foot, through streets, alleyways and house, none of which look like anything you would find in England. In this scene Vin Diesel grabs a machine gun out of the beak of police pick up truck, which contains 2 policemen eating donuts! 😂😂😂. The policemen even look like American cops!
The driving off into the sun set scene at the end, again supposed to be in England, again clearly in California. If you're going say you're in England, make it look and feel like England!
As for the rest of this film, Vin Diesel is the same emotionless plank of wood character he is in every film. The best roles he's ever played are Groot and the voice of the Iron Giant. He should just stick to voice work, with as few lines as possible. That's where he shines. Guy Pearce is too good for this film, the female characters are classically 2 dimensional and wearing tight or slightly see through clothing. The plot and action as are instantly forgettable and the ""twist"" is obvious from the first few seconds.
Watch if you don't want to think and there really is absolutely nothing else to do. I mean nothing!",Bloodshot
