0,TheLittleSongbird,"A film that you see once, and never forget...",10,9 December 2009,"I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, and have really liked all of the movies of his I have seen so far. My top 5 favourites are Vertigo, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this, I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie, I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.Psycho is a film that you see once and never forget, and one of the few movies out there that has left me traumatised. The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films, I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel, and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.The shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying, suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way, and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound, but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it, when I hear that motif, I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.Other pros are a good plot, a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary, with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie, and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates, he didn't just play creepy, he WAS creepy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time. All in all, a Hitchcock masterpiece! 10/10 Bethany Cox",Psycho
1,bkoganbing,Cleaning Up After Mom,9,18 October 2006,"During the Mid Eighties I attended a science fiction convention in Manhattan and the feature attraction there was Anthony Perkins. There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly. Perkins did not really know how to handle the banter, he was in my estimation a serious guy who must have thought he was in a freak show. I asked him about appearing in Friendly Persuasion with Gary Cooper and I told him that that was my favorite role he did. He looked grateful that someone knew he did something besides Norman Bates.But for better or worse, Norman Bates became his career role and it's what we remember Anthony Perkins for. He does create an indelible impression on the screen with Alfred Hitchcock's direction as the shy mother fixated man running a flea bag motel in an area where a new super highway has taken all the potential business.Psycho has a simple plot. Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40,000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leigh's boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them. Simple enough, but Alfred Hitchcock creates a mood of terror and suspense that lingers long after you've seen the film. My favorite shot of the film is not Leigh's legendary shower stabbing, but of Martin Balsam being knocked down and falling down that flight of stairs and then being stabbed to death. The camera work showing Balsam falling backwards is the most terrifying part of Psycho.Though Anthony Perkins did so many other good things, the average cinema fan will tell you 99 out of 100 times that Norman Bates is the role he remembers Perkins for. So Perkins went with the flow.It was repetitious for him, but a treat for fans.",Psycho
2,Leofwine_draca,Hitch's masterwork,10,28 July 2014,"PSYCHO truly is an excellent film, a movie which, along with the same year's PEEPING TOM, managed to kick start a new genre of psychological thrillers which continues to this day. It's perfectly made, with an excellent story (thanks to the reliable schlockmeister Robert Bloch), a great script adaptation, and assured direction from Hitchcock.It's hard to know what stands out here the most: the brooding cinematography, in which features such as the Bates Motel become characters in their own right, or Anthony Perkins's most famous role. Perkins encapsulates Bates perfectly, making him a bogeyman far more frightening than the OTT fantasy creations of a Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees.Watching it today, it's tough to imagine sitting through it without knowing the various twists beforehand, but they must have been mind-blowing to newcomers. And one of the things I like best is that the film is already great, and thrilling, even before the action shifts to the Bates Motel. Add in a great Martin Balsam performance and you have one of the greatest masterworks of 20th century cinema, in my humble opinion.",Psycho
3,SnoopyStyle,Hitchcock the master salesman,9,29 November 2013,"Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40k from work, and runs away. In a stormy night, she stops at the isolated Bates Motel where she meets creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).This one has Alfred Hitchcock as the master salesman. It's the biggest show in show business, and he's the master of ceremony. He pulls out all the stops like the secrecy and the refusal of entry to late arrivals. It helps to have the most iconic movie scene of all times.Janet Leigh isn't just a damsel in distress or a shrinking violet. She is a woman with a dark side. The fact that she's an A-list star used to mean that she'll last until the end of the movie. When the super creepy Anthony Perkins joins her, it was set up for a prolong creepfest. Then comes the most well made important scene in history. The second half does have a little struggle to reclimb that peak, and I didn't like all the pontificating at the end. But those are tiny problems in a great movie.",Psycho
4,Hitchcoc,Tight and Terrifying,10,5 October 2001,"When Hitchcock tells a tale, he engages the mind of the audience. We don't need to see knives tearing into flesh, people being strangled on the screen, or gunshots ripping through a brain. And still, when we are finished, we are more uncomfortable than had we watched the actual murder. In Psycho, it's all about vulnerability. Janet Leigh is in a state of great agitation and needs to trust someone. Unfortunately it is the master taxidermist, Anthony Perkins. His Norman Bates, with his nervous tics, his analytical surmises, his understatement, are master-pieces of madness. This film is what every student should see. It is montage; it is tautness; it is the best kind of storytelling. The things which were still with me a month after seeing this for the first time were as follows:1. The house. That ominous house, peering down, Poe-like from the hill above the motel. How can architecture better capture threat.2. The scene with the patrolman.3. The conversation Norman when Marion first stops at the motel.4. The shower scene. I can still hear the theramin (used again at the end), and the blood flowing down the shower drain.5. The killing of Martin Balsam on the stairs (he also used this perspective in Vertigo and Topaz).6. The ""conversations"" with Mother.7. The naked light bulb swinging as the rocker turns around and Norman coming into the basement.What a great director. He saw everything and knew how to fill every minute with suspense. A truly masterly film.",Psycho
5,kosmasp,A must-see,10,21 November 2009,"Especially if you are into thrillers. I haven't seen the shot-by-shot remake that came out, 10 years or so ago, but if you watch one Psycho, it should be this one. Actually if you watch more than one Psycho, it would be good if you'd watch the other Psychos (Psycho 2, 3 and so forth). Although they are with Anthony Perkins, I'm pretty sure they are not as good as this one though.A very eerie performance by Mr. Perkins then, with a very interesting idea (that hopefully comes as a surprise when you watch it, because it would be a shame if someone did spoil you the movie, by telling you what will happen). Quite a few things get done here and other directors have taken those ideas and used them time and again. It's a testament to Hitchcocks genius, how good his movie works and still how much tension is in it, because it hasn't aged a bit.A great movie, by a great director. I watched it recently at a cinema, but I have to admit, that I missed the small cameo Hitchcock has in his movies. That's saying something about how gripping the movie was for me. And since I hadn't seen it for quite some time, I really discovered quite a few things, by watching it. So even if you have seen it, you can watch it again and again!",Psycho
6,classicsoncall,"""My hobby is stuffing things...""",9,13 January 2007,"Chances are that if you go into this movie cold without knowing anything about it (I know, that's almost impossible), you'll be about a half hour into the picture and wondering what the title might be all about. Sure Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) seems highly erratic when questioned by the patrolman, but hardly psychotic. It's not until director Hitchcock suddenly pulls the rug out from under the forty thousand dollar robbery setup, and Marion falls victim to the frenzy of a slashing knife accompanied by the now historic soundtrack that's been indelibly identified with ""Psycho"", that we get the idea that this is not your standard mystery.This is a classic and historic movie, the first on many levels to create a new kind of horror film. Hitchcock was a master of thrills and suspense without ever relying on violence. Here he allows a slight departure from that formula, but without overemphasizing the gore. When the naked Marion Crane is attacked in a shower, completely helpless, it was the birth of a new genre, which unfortunately has degraded into the sensationalist slasher schlock of present day. In ""Psycho"", you never see it coming, except for that shadowed figure behind the shower curtain, but by then it's too late to gasp, you're caught up in the on screen event, and it leaves you breathless.Some viewers call it a perfect film. I don't know if I would go that far, as I've thought about things I might have changed in telling the story. When Marion leaves the used car lot under scrutiny of the highway patrolman, it makes you wonder why he didn't follow up his instinct that there was something fishy going on. Then at the end of the film, the way the psychologist explained in detail the nature of Norman Bates' psychosis, made it seem like it wasn't enough to let the viewer arrive at a conclusion for oneself. But those nitpicks aside, one has to give credit to the principals for pulling off a great psychological and horror thriller. Anthony Perkins couldn't have been smoother, and it's not until at least a second viewing that you realize how wonderful a set up you have to the film's dire outcome. Sitting there talking to Marion among his menagerie of stuffed birds, Norman Bates gives a subtle hint as to the horror about to unfold - ""You know what I think..., I think that..., we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out...""Watch this one alone..., at night..., in the dark.",Psycho
7,gavin6942,"So Influential, It Makes My Head Spin",9,12 January 2007,"A young woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 (roughly a quarter million today) from her employer and runs off to meet her boyfriend. But along the way she stops at the Bates Motel, and meets the charming Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Marion and her money might not make it back to her boyfriend Sam in perfect condition.Yes, after 47 years of this film existing and being a horror fan for well over 10 years now, I finally broke down and watched what is widely considered to be Hitchcock's best film (I had previously seen ""Lamb to Slaughter"", ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"" -- and have now seen many more since). Boy, was I missing out on something! Now I cannot wait to see ""Psycho 2"" and ""Psycho 3"" (which I own for some reason). I have seen parts of the Gus Van Sant remake but was not impressed.The acting was very good, especially from Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates). He did a great job as a friendly boy-next-door caretaker. Vivian Leigh was also good as Marion Crane, and I am sorry she had to have a hermaphroditic child like Jamie Lee Curtis. All other parts were fine. I hear they called the actor who played Sam Loomis ""the stiff"" and boy are they right! Later in the film he loosens up a little bit, but in the opening scene he seems so wooden.The bird symbolism is nice... especially with Hitchcock's other big horror film being ""The Birds"". And the main character being Marion ""Crane""? Is she going to get stuffed like the other birds in the parlor? I will not say, but you probably already know (since pretty much everyone knows about this film even if they never saw it).Most startling for me was Bernard Herrmann's score, particularly the main theme (not the knife noise). I had long heard rumors that ""Re-Animator"" ripped off the ""Psycho"" theme and I thought they meant it was a variation on the theme. An homage, perhaps (because who would try to steal from such a famous film). Well, the music is exactly the same. I mean, really dead on. So now I do not know how to feel about ""Re-Animator"", which is practically my favorite horror film (with all due respect to ""The Janitor"")... which shakes up my whole foundation and makes me rethink movie history! My only complaint was the confusion (at least for me) of where the Bates Motel is. Marion drives all Friday night and then arrives Saturday evening, implying it is a great distance from Phoenix. Yet, when the detective investigates the motel, he tells someone on the phone he is less than an hour from them. Where is he based if not Phoenix?Well, if you have not seen this, you should. It is a classic and with good reason (as I typed this the first time, it was ranked the 22nd greatest film of all time on Internet Movie Database and still lingers around 25th three years later). Not just a great horror classic, but also a great film with great directing and cast. Plus, if you are from Wisconsin like I am, you'll love the Ed Gein storyline. (Incidentally, if you have never visited Ed Gein's hometown or grave, you should. It is a good time.)",Psycho
8,lee_eisenberg,"since everyone knows the story, let's talk about camera angles and such...",10,14 July 2005,"I checked the spoiler box because I think that even any discussion about camera angles will give the ending away. For starters, when Marion and Norman first meet, you can see Norman's reflection in the window, as if there's two of him. When Marion and Norman are eating dinner in the room with the stuffed birds, you can see that some of the birds are positioned so that their beaks look almost as if they're pecking at both Marion and Norman; something is eating at Norman, and we get to see a premonition of Marion's impending fate. When Norman looks through the hole (which incidentally is behind a picture of two people attacking a woman), we get a POV shot; when Marion is in the shower, we get a POV shot. When Norman pushes Marion's car into the swamp, half of his face is in a shadow, as if he has two sides.On the subject of those birds, there are several references to birds throughout the movie: Marion's last name is Crane, she comes from Phoenix, and finally, the stuffed birds. The truth is, Hitchcock had a keen interest in avians; in ""Sabotage"", a woman finds her strength after watching ""Who Killed Cock Robin?"", then the bird references in ""Psycho"", and finally, the ornithological uprising in ""The Birds"". Speaking of the characters' names, there's Crane (a bird), Bates (bait), Loomis (gloom), and Arbogast (aghast).Another thing that Hitch does in this movie is play with the audience. First, the movie focuses on Marion. When she steals the money, you're not sure whether to root for her, because she is the main character and you want her to succeed, but do you want her to steal? Then, the movie focuses on Norman. When he hides Marion's murder, you want him to succeed, but succeed in hiding a murder? Finally, the focus shifts to Lila.Everyone remembers the shower scene, but what does it mean? It seems as though Marion, by flushing the paper down the toilet, was washing away her misdeeds, and taking a shower consecrated that.The dialogue is of course a key part. Obviously, ""Mother...what's the phrase...isn't quite herself today."" and ""A boy's best friend is his mother."" are premonitions, but there are others. In the discussion of institutions, Norman talks about ""...the cruel eyes studying you."" Then, when he looks through the hole, his eyes study Marion. At the end, you might say that there are three explanations: first, the bombastic psychiatrist explains Norman's mental state; then, ""mother"" describes how her son is guilty; and finally, the car is towed out of the swamp, as though they have dug into the putridity of Norman's mind. They have penetrated Norman's mind, just like the knives penetrated Marion's and Arbogast's bodies.On the DVD, you should watch the original trailer, which has Hitch showing us around the motel and house. He was really playing with the audience there. First off, he looked into a toilet. No movie had ever portrayed a toilet (but everyone knew why toilets existed), so what must the audience have thought about that? Also, he looks in a closet, looks surprised, and closes the closet. Did he see something in there? I try to imagine being someone who saw that trailer, and then saw the movie, waiting to see what would happen.",Psycho
9,jboothmillard,Psycho,10,4 March 2005,"This film is the most famous of all the films by Oscar nominated director Sir Alfred Hitchcock, unfortunately Rebecca was the most popular of his films, according to cinema tickets. Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane who has stolen $40,000 from her boss, she is now on the run. On her journey she finds the Bates Motel and decides to stop there for the night. She then meets a great villain played by Anthony Perkins, Norman Bates. As she gets to know him she finds he is quite terrifying while talking. He mentions his mother and says ""She just goes mad sometimes. We all go a little mad sometimes!"" Anyway, later she takes a shower, and everyone remembers seeing the stabbing of her, and the star is dead. The film continues this psychopathic story by having first Det. Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), who is murdered, and then her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) come and look for her. Hitchcock has done a superb job in creating suspense and horror, I especially loved the dead mother in the chair, and the great score by Bernard Herrmann, particularly the famous high screeches of the violins (like knives stabbing). Hitchcock's cameo is a man through Leigh's office window, wearing a cowboy hat. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Cinematography. Sir Alfred Hitchcock was number 75 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 4 on 100 Years of Film Scores, it was number 56 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes (""A boy's best friend is his mother.""), Norman Bates was number 2 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Scary Moments, it was number 1 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, it was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 11 on The 100 Greatest Films. Outstanding!",Psycho
10,ccthemovieman-1,"The More I See This, The Better It Gets",10,25 October 2006,"When I watched this for the first time in over 30 years, I was surprised how little action there was since I had remembered this as some intense horror movie. Of course, I was young and more impressionable so I guess I just remembered those few dramatic, sensational scenes such as Janet Leigh murdered in the shower and the quick other murder at the top of the stairs. Basically, that was about it, action-wise, BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film, the more I like it. It has become my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie, along with Rear Window.I mention the lack of action, and blood, too, because younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. A generation back, movie makers tended to build up characters and suspense, so there was a lot more storytelling and less action than you see today. Also, this movie doesn't have the shock value today for audiences, either, not after years of Freddie Krueger-type blood-and-guts seen in the past 30 years.But, what you WILL see in this movie is (1) superb acting; (2) a fascinating lead character; (3) excellent photography, and (4) a bizarre story.""Norman Bates"" is one of the most famous fictional names in film history, thanks to this film and the great work portraying him by Anthony Perkins. ""Norman"" is a nutcase, as it turns out and the more you know all about him, the more fun it is to study Perkins and his character ""Norman"" in subsequent viewings. He really has the guy down pat. However, it isn't just Perkins' film; the supporting is just fine with Leigh, whose figure is still awesome no matter how many times you see it; Martin Balsam as the private detective; Vera Miles and John Gavin. Everyone contributes.What makes me really enjoy this movie is the cinematography. I bought this on VHS when it became available on widescreen. Later, of course, I got the DVD. Each time, I appreciate John Russell's camera-work and Hitchcock's direction more and more. I wonder if this isn't Hitchcock's best job of directing as his camera angles and lighting are outstanding. On the DVD, the blacks, whites and grays are just super and the famous house next to the Bates Motel never looked better. That house really looks eerie.The sound effects in here don't hurt. When Balsam is attacked, the accompanying frightening music never fails to bring chills down my spine. The music literally ""screams"" at you.I went 35 years between showings but now have watched this five times in the past four years. I love it and look forward to seeing it again. Many people here think this is Hitchcock's greatest film. Add me to that list.",Psycho
11,rmax304823,Perfectly Normal Norman.,9,24 January 2011,"Hereabouts there be spoilers.I don't usually bother with warnings that some reveals will be revealed because so few films actually HAVE twists in them that are in any way shocking. Many mysteries, possibly most, have surprises waiting at the end but they rarely leave you dumbfounded. ""The Crying Game"" is one of the exceptions, however, and ""Psycho"" is the mother of them all.There isn't much point in going through the plot again, so I'll just note a few impressions that have lasted over many viewings.One is that there are a couple of usually ignored people in the crew that deserve medals. One is the production designer, who is responsible for the overall look of the picture. His work could hardly be improved upon, from the oppressively bleak landscape surrounding Janet Leigh's car when the CHP officer wakes her up, to the haunted mansion on top of the slight hill, surrounded by gardens of weeds.The other neglected contributor is the set dresser. Of course the director, the punctilious Hitchcock, decides questions of props and camera placement, but -- that soulless and bourgeois real estate office with its potted plants and its large picture of a sere landscape that perches over Janet Leigh's desk; the stuffed birds suggestive of Poe (a raven) or a menacing nocturnal predator (an owl), and the pictures of birds, juxtaposed with pictures of roly poly naked nymphs, some in the act of being violated. In Bloch's novel and in the film, the untitled book that Vera Miles examines in Perkins' little-boy bedroom is filled with pornography but it couldn't be shown on screen.The murder in the shower doesn't need to be described but I've never been able to watch this without a sinking feeling that Janet Leigh really doesn't NEED that shower at this particular point in time and space. Leigh is a fine actress. When she's driving away from Phoenix and the camera is on her face, minuscule expressions come and go across her features, reflecting the conversations she's fantasizing about. There's even a hint of a wry smile when she imagines the outrage of Cassady, the fat and self-satisfied millionaire, when he discovers that Leigh has absconded with the money he flaunted, as in -- ""Take that, you bastard."" There's something aptly birdlike about Janet Leigh too. She's narrow shouldered and long legged, a little stork-like, as well as being just the right age. She has the desperation of a woman facing forty. Of course to a man who's spent the last ten years alone with a corpse, Leigh is an object of Paphian interest. She's old but not too old yet, just as she's a star but not too big a star to torpedo the movie when she is eliminated from it.Two shots stand out from a multitude of originals. (1) When Balsam finds Leigh's fake signature in the motel's register, the camera is looking up at Tony Perkins, who is nibbling some candy. Balsam says, ""Oh, yes. Here she is,"" and invites Perkins to examine the fake. The camera doesn't cut away but remains on Perkins' jaw as he leans over the unseen book and we watch his jaw and adam's apple working nervously away. (2) Perkins decides to move Mama from her bedroom to the fruit cellar. The camera follows him very slowly as he climbs the stairs and enters her room, but inside of going through the door, the camera rises about the transom and pivots around, an extraordinary movement, so that when Perkins exits lugging mother in his arms, we are too flabbergasted by what the camera has done to notice any discrepancy between the reality Norman has constructed for us and any reality that most of the rest of us might recognize.(3) Just to be wanton, I'll throw in that shot of Janet Leigh's dead eye. The camera first follows a pale stream of blood down INTO the bathtub drain, then dissolves to Leigh's staring iris, then draws back along the floor while deliberately righting itself from a slight tilt to the proper vertical. (Check out the remake. The camera apes the original shot but practically twirls on its axis.) Two weakness or, let's say, things I wish Hitchcock would have done a little differently. One is that car gurgling and sinking into that accommodating swamp. You only find those swamps in the movies and Louisiana. The second is that experimental scene in which Martin Balsam tumbles backward down a rear-projected staircase. The director was more proud of the mechanical difficulties behind that shot than he had a right to be.You know what occurs to me sometimes, when I'm watching this, or when I'm watching some of the garbage that now fills our screens? I wish that the people writing and directing movies like ""Saw II"" would rescreen ""Psycho"" so they could get some hint about how to make a truly horrifying movie with practically no blood, no monsters with chain saws and no teen agers screaming and running round in panties. Man, have we lost our grip, or what? And while we're at it let's have no more girls named Jillian or Megan, either. I'm tired of them. Bring back the old days when movies had little blood and girls had sensible names like Mary and Hepzibah. Oh -- and let's get rid of that hand-held electronic junk too. No more iPods or Pseudopods or whatever they are. No Blackberries or Strawberries either. Whatever happened to whitewall tires?",Psycho
12,Tweekums,An unforgettable masterpiece,10,2 February 2017,"Marion Crane works for an estate agent in Phoenix; one Friday afternoon a client pays $40,000 in cash for a property and her boss ask to take it for the bank as he doesn't want it in the office over the weekend. Rather than going to the bank she sets off to California. It is a long journey and after spending one night in her car, after she is woken by a suspicious police officer she buys a new car. Then, as it starts to rain, she leaves the main road and stops at a remote motel for the night. The motel is run by Norman Bates who tells her that he lives in the neighbouring house with his aged mother. He appears to be friendly as he offers to make her something for supper. She hears his mother expressing her disapproval of him being alone with a young woman before she has her supper in the office. The then returns to her room and prepares for bed. Now things get creepy; Norman takes a picture off the wall and uses a spy hole to observe Marion as she gets undressed. Then as she takes a shower somebody enters her room and brutally murders her. Soon people are starting to wonder what happened to her and the $40,000. Her boss has sent a private detective to find her and her sister goes to see her boyfriend, who has no idea where she is. The detective checks a string of motels before finding that she stayed at the Bates motel. As the story progresses we learn more about Norman and his mother all leading to one of cinema's most shocking conclusions.This film is rightly considered a classic; I would love to have watched it without knowing about what happened. For the first half of the film follows Marion Crane, setting her up as the protagonist; everybody else we see, including Norman Bates, appears to be very much secondary characters so anybody lucky enough not to know the film's first famous twist should be genuinely surprised. Until her death it looks as though the film would centre on whether she would be caught or whether she would see the error of her ways and return the money. After the infamous 'shower scene' the tone changes dramatically as we learn just what is going on at the Bates Motel and ultimately discover Norman's shocking secret. Janet Leigh does a fine job as the good girl who has made a bad choice but it is Anthony Perkins who stands out with his nuanced performance as Norman Bates; at times charming at others chilling. Hitchcock's direction is superb; he manages to show brutal murder without actually showing and of the actual brutality; just a raised knife, Marion screaming and blood going down the plug hole blood that isn't even red as the film is black and white.

14,BA_Harrison,Not to be confused with the 1998 film of the same name (as if).,10,4 April 2010,"Psycho is undoubtedly Alfred Hitchcock's most famous film, and not for no reason: it's a masterclass in suspense, tension and terror that, even half a century after it first stunned audiences with its raw, psychological horror, has lost none of its ability to shock.For those who don't already know, Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, creepy proprietor of the Bates Motel, situated off the old highway 15 miles from the town of Fairvale. Janet Leigh is bank employee Marion Crane, who has let temptation get the better of her and absconded with $40,000. Feeling tired after a long trip on the road to visit her lover Sam Loomis (John Gavin), Marion decides to check into the Bates establishment, where she meets a sticky end whilst taking a shower (c'mon, don't tell me you didn't know...).When Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) travels to Fairvale to see if Sam knows anything of her sister's whereabouts, she is tailed by private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), whose expertise eventually leads him to the Bates motel where Norman and 'mother' wait with butcher's knife in hand.Working from a script by Joseph Stefano (based on the novel by Robert Bloch), Hitchcock delivers a flawless exercise in horror that sees the director develop techniques so effective that they are still imitated to this day, but which are rarely as well executed as they are here. Hitchcock's finest achievement with Psycho is undoubtedly fooling his audience into assuming that Leigh is the central character and then suddenly bumping her off, metaphorically pulling the rug from under the viewers feet; but he also manages many other brilliant touches, including Marion Crane's tense flight from Phoenix, where she imagines how events are unfolding at the bank, Norman's disposal of Ms Crane's car in a swamp (with her body in the boot), a moment of wonderful dark humour as the vehicle momentarily refuses to sink, and of course, the macabre ending in which Lila discovers Norman's mother hiding in the fruit cellar.Add a cool title sequence by Saul Bass and a fantastic score by Bernard Hermann, itself often imitated, and what you have is a bona fide classic of the horror genre (yes, horror) that any self respecting fan should ensure that they see at least several times. It's that good.",Psycho
15,moonspinner55,"Exasperatingly detailed, steely-cold precursor to the 'slasher'...",7,26 October 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock has no sympathy for the victims in ""Psycho"", and he views them dispassionately. This relatively low-budget film is in silvery black-and-white, eerie and beautiful, with gliding camera-work and clever production touches which warrant repeat viewings, however it is much too merciless towards its characters to be a black comedy. It's also not much of a murder-mystery (we have an early idea of what's going on), yet the suspense in the third act is mounted with cunning precision. Mostly, Hitchcock seems curiously fascinated with plot-exposition and details, although the picture is still quite chilling. Anthony Perkins' tightly-controlled performance as Norman Bates is hypnotizing: his boyish good looks can be taken either way--gangly or crazily disconnected--and his eyes, which are frantic, dart around like an impatient child's (it's the role of a lifetime). I didn't much care for Simon Oakland's psychology report at the end, but the final shots and the voice-over are masterfully pulled-off. *** from ****",Psycho

18,Quinoa1984,Shocking,10,21 February 2000,"Psycho is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films ever made and is one of the few horror masterpieces in film history. That's the main-line, given stroke of it. But what it comes down to is that, really, seriously... it's Psycho - the one and only (that we acknowledge, screw off, Gus Van Sant). More than anything why it's Hitchcock's triumph as a commercial filmmaker - past the shower scene and the camera tricks and the notorious finale - is that it's (not so) secretly a monument to what we hide in all of us.What I love about the movie seeing it again after so many years is seeing how in her own way Marion Crane is a bit of a psycho, just not quite at the level of 11 that Norman Bates is. There's an interesting parallel to make to how voice-over is used; Marion's imagination gets the better of her for a moment as she drives along and she makes up what the cop that pulls her over, her boss, her boyfriend, etc, all say. Watch as her face contorts into a little grin, almost against her better judgment, when she imagines the more twisted portion of the dialog. Frankly, I've had dialogs going in my head like that, imagining the worst that could happen from a mistake or bad deed, and almost taking pleasure in the more morbid aspects (I mean, hey, I directed Jealous Jerzy, what does that tell you? But I digress).So keep that in mind when it comes time for the end of the movie - hell any portion really with Norman and ""Mother"". But mostly that last scene. After what is an amusing parody of exposition (the psychologist goes on for so long that it's the only logical explanation aside from dated, clunky writing - I prefer to think Hitchcock was smarter than that and was mocking what would or could be an exposition on Norman Bates + Mother and then just ""Mother""), Norman/Mother is in his/her room, and the camera closes in as the voice-over gets intense, plotting, paranoid, not wanting to swat a fly. Perhaps Hitchcock wants to draw the parallel, though there is a distinction: Marion imagines other people talking, while Norman isn't even in the equation: it IS Mother. Yeah.Such great stuff. And if you haven't seen it before... what are you reading this for ya dummy!",Psycho

I'm not a giant fan of Alfred Hitchcock but I do find that he deserves his title ""master of suspense"". If it were only for this movie alone.

21,sunwarrior13,A Horror Classic,10,27 February 2012,"Psycho is a suspense/horror film directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh. The screenplay by Joseph Stefano is based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The novel was loosely inspired by the crimes of Wisconsin murderer and grave robber Ed Gein,who lived just 40 miles from Bloch.In the 60's,Hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense when he released Psycho and forever changed the shape and tone of the screen thriller. From its first scene, in which an unmarried couple balances pleasure and guilt in a lunchtime liaison in a cheap hotel, Psycho announced that it was taking the audience to places it had never been before, and on that score what followed would hardly disappoint. The film depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane,hiding at a secluded motel after embezzling money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner and manager, Norman Bates, and the aftermath of their encounter.Marion is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and frustrated in her romance with hardware store manager Sam Loomis. One afternoon, she is given $40,000 in cash to be deposited in the bank. Minutes later, impulse has taken over and Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her purloined nest egg. 36 hours later, paranoia and exhaustion have started to set in, and Marion decides to stop for the night at the Bates Motel, where nervous but personable innkeeper Norman Bates cheerfully mentions that she's the first guest in weeks, before he regales her with curious stories about his mother. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, but while the shower scene is justifiably the film's most famous sequence, there are dozens of memorable bits throughout this film.Obviously,it remains a horror classic as it was filmed with tact, grace, and art as well as blends a brutal manipulation of audience identification and an incredibly dense, allusive visual style to create the most morally unsettling film ever made.",Psycho

23,hitchcockthelegend,I can handle a sick old woman!,10,29 April 2010,"50 years ago, Alfred Hitchcock released Psycho. Girl is having an affair with this guy, she runs away with $40,000 that she was supposed to bank for her employer. On the road heading for California to be with her lover, scared, guilt ridden and exhausted, she pulls into the secluded Bates Motel for a night of rest. There she meets the affable Norman Bates, girl takes shower and cinema got a jolt to the system.What can you say about Psycho that hasn't been said before? Well nothing in truth, it's been dissected and discussed by all and sundry since its release in 1960. From critics to film makers and from the man in the street to the King Of Siam (probably), Psycho is known and largely admired by most in this day and age. However, the initial reaction to it on release was mixed, the words ""gimmick movie"" were even used in some quarters, while in others it was labelled as a stain on the great director's career. Made for roughly around $800,000 in just 30 days, and using his basic crew from his TV show, Hitchcock adapts the Robert Bloch pulp novel with cold hearted glee. Manipulating the audience as he lays out his American Nightmare, Hitch deals in fluid camera movements, jolting shock tactics, the ""mother"" of all twists and garners two incredible performances from Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the process. Not only that but he's also got Saul Bass helping on the visuals and Bernard Herrmann providing a terrifying stab string score that has long since gone down in the annals of greatness.The proof is in the pudding, that the film is still today, 50 years on, regarded as belonging to the upper echelons of classic cinema, is its lasting legacy. An original and genre bending piece of genius film making from a master of his craft.

24,jotix100,Hitchcock at his scariest,10,1 November 2005,"""Psycho"", the Hitchcock masterpiece of 1960, is still a scary ride. TCM presented it on Halloween night, which was an appropriate way to add to all the horror being shown on television.As the film opens, we are treated to Saul Bass' titles that herald some of what one is expecting will come in the film. Then, one hears the magnificent opening bars of Bernard Herrmann's music score and one realizes this is not an ordinary movie. The crisp black and white cinematography by John Russell, as well as the intelligent editing by George Tomasini, surpass any doubt this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best work. Of course, the film owes a debt to Joseph Stefano who adapted the Robert Bloch novel, in which the movie is based, with great flair.""Psycho"" works because of the wonderful cast assembled for the movie. Anthony Perkins was an actor who could play anything. His range was enormous, as he shows in the film. His Norman Bates shows a man that appears to be in complete control of himself. We watch him as he begins to unravel when confronted first by Arbogast, and then by Sam Loomis. Mr. Perkins' performance is one of the best he ever gave in his film career.Janet Leigh who plays Marion Crane is perfect as the small would be criminal who happens to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's a tribute to Ms. Leigh's talent that she underplays Marion because she is battling with her own conscience as she realizes the enormity of what she has done. Alas, she was not going to make good on her resolve.The supporting cast is also interesting. Martin Balsam plays the private detective well. He is instrumental in cracking Norman's confidence, but of course, it comes with a high price he must pay for trying to shake the sick man. Vera Miles and John Gavin are seen as Marion's sister and boyfriend.""Psycho"" will remain an exercise in horror by a man who knew how to scare us, Alfred Hitchcock!",Psycho
25,Hey_Sweden,"""A boy's best friend is his Mother.""",10,26 October 2012,"Alfred Hitchcocks' ""Psycho"" still stands tall as one of the most riveting shockers ever made. At the time, it was an interesting experiment for the director, having been filmed on a low budget and in black & white. It introduced characters and scenes that became an enormous part of the popular culture and influenced a GREAT many films that followed.Based on the novel by Robert Bloch (itself inspired by the exploits of real-life madman Ed Gein), it manages one of the absolute best twists in plot to be committed to film, making us believe it's about secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her impulsive theft of her boss' clients' money, only to jerk the rug out from under us in a now legendary ""shower sequence"". Marion makes the fateful decision of seeking shelter in the way-out-of-the-way Bates Motel, run by peculiar young man Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly wimpy person who's dominated by his shrewish Mother.It's a testament to how powerful and endlessly entertaining ""Psycho"" is, that it can continue to enthrall us no matter how many times we see it. Hitchcocks' murder set pieces are the kind you never forget, and they're made all the more so by the most infamous (and imitated) of all of Bernard Herrmanns' music scores. It really helps to drive the movie forward, and Hitch and company create some truly delicious atmosphere, especially when it comes to *that* house, looking sinister and foreboding up on its hill. Screenwriter Joseph Stefano does impressive things with dialogue and a top notch cast memorably brings the characters to life. Perkins is just tremendous in the role of Norman, so tremendous that the role and performance would loom large for the rest of his life and career. Vera Miles is wonderfully feisty as Marions' sister, who'll stop at nothing to find her, while John Gavin makes for a stoic hero. Leigh is winning in the role of the larcenous Marion and her scenes with Perkins are superb. Great character players like Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Frank Albertson, John Anderson, Mort Mills, and Simon Oakland round out the cast, while Hitchs' daughter Pat plays the role of Caroline.They all help to make watching this a rich experience, one that can look even better after repeat viewings, with elements (the bird imagery & references, for example) one might not fully appreciate on the first viewing. This is a movie milestone that everybody ought to see at least once.Followed by three sequels, the TV movie 'Bates Motel', a remake, and the 'Bates Motel' TV series.10 out of 10.",Psycho

She's driving to see her boyfriend (John Gavin) and run away with him. She stops overnight at the Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his cranky unseen mother...I don't deny that this movie is masterfully done by Alfred Hitchcock--the direction here is incredible. The justly famous shower scene and the murder of Arbogast are still shocking. The music score by Bernard Herrmann fits the film perfectly too. It's all well-done...but I'm not crazy (sorry) about it. Maybe it's because of my first time seeing it. I saw it in third grade on late night TV. The shower scene was completely cut out as was the explanation at the end! I was totally lost. So I thought it was a stupid, pointless movie. It's neither of course but first impressions are hard to ignore.This is one of Hitchcock's true horror films. It was made in black and white on a low budget with a crew taken from Hitchcock's TV show. Also most of the cast took a cut in pay just to work with him. No one thought this would work but it's now considered a classic. I like it a lot but I find some of the acting stiff (Vera Miles and John Gavin especially) and some boring sequences. Let's face it--we all know Norman is his mother so that sort of lessens the movie. Leigh is good in her role and Perkins is just incredible in his. He rightfully plays Bates as a shy awkward little boy--but you see the madness lurking inside him. A truly great performance that came far too soon for Perkins and (sadly) destroyed his career. It's worth seeing of course but I consider ""Rope"" or ""North by Northwest"" as being much better films. Ignore the stupid R rating this still carries--it would get a PG-13 today.

I liked Psycho for sure but I think it was a film of it's time, it was a groundbreaking film by all accounts but I wasn't even born when this was originally released & I would imagine Psycho would have more impact back then than it does now. The shocking plot twists, the way the star of the film is suddenly killed, the psychology behind Norman's motives & it's realistic approach to violence & murder probably made Psycho a groundbreaking cinematic event when it came out in 1960 but viewing it for the first time in 2007 it's undeniably a good film but one I didn't cream my pants over, unlike some it seems. I think it's a very good film, a film which I would call a thriller more than a horror & I thought it was entertaining but not outstanding. Because the shower scene is so well know it's not going to shock anyone the way it did back in 1960 & the other aspects of the story are so well known the same thing applies. Don't get me wrong as that isn't Psycho's fault in itself but, well I just knew what was going to happen & that can't be good.Director Hitchcock does a great job here, he keeps the camera right in people's faces which gives it a claustrophobic feel. This is pretty stylish & is very atmospheric which the black and white photography really helps. He keeps things moving along, the character's & dialogue are good & it passes the time harmlessly enough. The violence is tame by todays standards.According to the IMDb Psycho had an estimated budget of $806,947 which seems like a very specific number for an 'estimate' don't you think? It's well made with good production values throughout. The acting is also very good from all involved.Psycho is a great film & I'm not saying it isn't but I didn't think it was the absolute classic many say it is & to an extent it's become a victim of it's own success as everyone knows the story already, definitely worth a watch all the same. Followed by Psycho II (1983), Psycho III (1986), the made-for-TV Bates Motel (1987) & Psycho IV: The Beginning (1990) & it was remade virtually shot-for-shot in colour as Psycho (1998).",Psycho

It is regarded as a true horror classic and for a good reason. ""Psycho"" might not be a movie that scares you but it certainly is a 'creepy' movie with a chilling Anthony Perkins as the 'psycho' Norman Bates.The directing by Alfred Hitchcock is truly masterful. He tells the story with lots of almost poetic like style of directing. There are many sequences that I truly regard as classic and renewing for the genre and no, I am not just only talking about the famous shower-scene. Also the role the characters play in the movie is really done superb. I mean, the character who we'll all think will be the hero and main character in the beginning, gets killed half way through the movie, how brilliant is that? This movie opened the door for more adult horror with layers. Before this most horror movies were movies with a supernatural story and monsters in it. This is one of the most important movies that made horror movies what they are today.Another factor that makes this movie a classic is the 'villain' played by Anthony Perkins. He plays a truly chilling psychopath what makes his character a truly classic one.Also the musical score only consisting out of stringed instruments by Bernard Hermann is a real classic. Most people will probably only remember the music used during the famous shower-scene, a shame because the rest of the score is also magnificent and deserves to be heard by everyone. Hermann and Hitchcock were truly both, two persons that were ahead of their time.Basically it's pointless whether to recommend this movie or not, since this is a movie that literally almost every person has already seen.One of the most influential, flawless, chilling, classic movie ever made.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Psycho

He had a gift for making memorable and impressive films, and Psycho is without a doubt one of the most well-known and popular. One of the reasons is of course the famous shower scene, but that's only one of many memorable and well-done sequences. The reason we remember that particular scene is not only how nicely filmed, tightly edited and effective it is... but also how credible it is. We believe in it, despite how little it shows of what it depicts, we believe that it happens, despite all we see is innuendo and hinting. The plot is great. Entirely credible and realistic. The whole film is psychologically accurate. The acting is superb, particularly Anthony Perkins. The pacing is great; you're hardly ever bored. The writing is excellent, both as far as story and dialog go. There are plenty of quotable lines. What makes this film work so well is how realistic and believable it is. What makes it shocking is how surprising it is. What makes this film have such an impact is that it's perfectly credible. I won't reveal any more, in case anyone reading this review don't know the twist of the film. If you are one of those people, watch this before you're told of it. It's incredible. I recommend this to any fan of horror, thriller and/or Hitchcock. 10/10",Psycho
35,kevinolzak,First seen on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater in February 1972,10,20 September 2020,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" may well be the greatest motion picture ever made, certainly the best film that ever popped up on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater during a time when availability was mostly left to the bottom half of drive-in double bills. Robert Bloch's original 1959 novel was inspired by the real life horrors perpetrated by Wisconsin necrophile Ed Gein, kidnapping his mother's corpse to care for it and despoiling other graves for food or souvenirs (Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chain Saw Massacre"" expertly conveyed the sickening atmosphere of such depravity). In refashioning this normal looking, unsuspected farmer into Norman Bates, balding, alcoholic, middle aged proprietor of the Bates Motel built by his mother, the same events play out as in Hitchcock's adaptation, though despite living only 35 miles from Gein's hometown of Plainfield Bloch remained unaware of the actual crimes until it was almost completed (he was amazed at how similar the dynamic turned out to be living out in the country, a puritanical religious fanatic mother whose son acted out in much the same way as his fictional counterpart). Hitchcock purchased the rights for a pittance in an attempt to go against his recent history of big budget efforts with major stars for a small scale black and white production done by his television arm Shamley, apparently inspired by showman filmmaker William Castle. His chosen screenwriter was Joseph Stefano, listening intently to the director's changes with surprise and delight, shifting the initial focus not on Norman but on fugitive Marion Crane, in possession of $40,000 stolen to pay off her fiancee's debts so that they can marry. All Hitchcock had to do was suggest Anthony Perkins for Norman to engage the audience's sympathy, the up and coming 27 year old actor had already been nominated for an Oscar for only his second screen role in ""Friendly Persuasion,"" while casting Janet Leigh as Marion was even better, a lovely and versatile actress whose star qualities could carry the crucial early section and pull the viewers into her 'private trap' (she lost the Academy Award for Best Actress but did win a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress). Another masterstroke was personally appearing on all the posters with strict guidelines on how the film should be exhibited, no one to be admitted after the picture's start: ""I realize this is a revolutionary concept but we have discovered that PSYCHO is unlike most pictures and does not improve when run backwards!"" Topping that had to be the best tagline ever conceived: ""don't give away the ending, it's the only one we have!"" Filmed on the Universal backlot, where the Bates motel would be seen in several episodes of Boris Karloff's THRILLER, it was a reluctant pickup for Paramount to finish off a previous contract (put off by the violence and adult subject matter), not expecting much of a return under Hitchcock's restrictions and no advance screenings yet becoming the biggest blockbuster of his entire career from massive ballyhoo and word of mouth. He wanted to prove that a relatively minor feature from William Castle could have turned out much better with a decent director on a small investment, and in playing the audience like a piano succeeded beyond his wildest dreams...but where do you go from here? Transforming something perfectly ordinary into something terrifying was a challenge he always enjoyed, and would meet with ""The Birds."" And believe it or not, William Castle himself described his latest plot to screenwriter Robb White, who deemed ""Homicidal"" fairly impressive until he went to see ""Psycho"" and realized that this 'original' idea was a complete ripoff! John Gavin had not seen the last of the Bates Motel, both appearing in the very last episode of THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR in 1965, ""Off Season,"" directed by a young William Friedkin and scripted by none other than Robert Bloch.",Psycho

The granddaddy of all slasher films and serial killers, this Alfred Hitchcock classic defined the post-Cold War horror film for generations to come in this rather simple storyline: bank employee Marion Crane (Leigh) absconds with a client's bankroll and winds up the proverbial fly in the spider's parlor when she winds up in the middle-of- nowhere's Bates Motel, and mama's boy Norman Bates (Perkins in his iconic role) proving to be more than meets the eye. The perfectly edited shower scene (the blade never pierces the flesh!) by Geroge Tomasini, Bernard Herrmann's screeching violins score and the all-together ookie finale are American classics in every sense of the word.

37,view_and_review,Hitchcock's Magnum Opus,10,23 December 2018,"Psycho has to be Hitchcock's magnum opus it's that brilliant. It's a masterful symbiosis of plot, story, acting and directing. I would say that Psycho is the genesis of the slasher movie. That may or may not be something to be proud of considering many of the slashers out there but I would venture to say that Psycho is the first.Also among the firsts would have to be Norman Bates. That name needs no introduction or any description much like Jason Voorhees, Michael Meyers, Freddy Kruger, and Chucky. If there were a conference of them all then Norman would be in the godfather's seat. The performance by Anthony Perkins was stellar. From the talkativeness to the jittery, stammering nervousness, to the mad silence as the voice in his head spoke he was terrific. Too many performances in the 50's and 60's were stuffy, not so Anthony Perkins. Hitchcock chose the perfect actor to make this film legendary.",Psycho
38,neil-476,Groundbreaking and brilliant,9,6 June 2010,"I was fortunate enough to see Psycho for the first time at a late night cinema presentation with an audience full of teens who had heard about the shower scene but had, like me, never seen the film before. And, apart from the notoriety of the shower scene, we didn't know the rest of the story.There was no internet, no IMDb, it hadn't been on TV yet, and people had been quite good about keeping the main elements of it under wraps.So we didn't know that we were going to identify with Marion Crane, tempted into committing a robbery, realising the mistake she'd made, having a helpful conversation with the nice young man at the motel she had checked into which led to her resolving to put things right. And then being abruptly, savagely, and shockingly slaughtered. We didn't know we'd identify with her. But Hitchcock did and, while we were sitting in the darkness trying to regain some sort of footing after the emotional carpet had been ripped out from under our feet, Hitchcoock was sitting behind the camera quietly amused at how he had manipulated us.And then he did it again (without cutting us loose from our emotional moorings, admittedly) - Arbogast's killing, the revelation of the mummy, Norman's appearance in the doorway, and Norman's final look to camera - all shocking, horrifying moments.This movie is a masterclass in audience manipulation, with nothing to equal it before or since (Jaws came close).",Psycho
39,evanston_dad,We All Go a Little Mad Sometimes,10,31 October 2005,"I can't decide whether ""Psycho"" or ""Rear Window"" is Hitchcock's best film. My answer on any given day is usually dependent on which one I've most recently watched.There's no need to go into the performances, or the shocking story, or the Bernard Herrman score (one of the best ever in film history). All that's been covered. Having just watched this film again in honor of Halloween weekend, I was struck fresh by the movie's frankness, which had to have been beyond uncomfortable for film audiences at the time. Supposedly film executives on screening this film were shocked more than anything else by the shots of the toilet in the hotel bathroom. If that was enough to shock, then what about references to transvestites, sexual arousal and release, and the blood-splattered bathroom that Hitchcock shows Perkins cleaning up in rigorous detail? The movie is so honest about the human body, its more unpleasant urges and physical qualities, that when the camera follows a swirl of blood down the shower drain, you half expect to see a big clump of hair sticking out of it. And to think this film came out at the same time as Douglas Sirk was making his films, in which women are as carefully painted and polished as china dolls.The true test of a great film is how well it stands up to the test of time, and whether or not you can revisit it and find something new in it each time you do so. By that measure, ""Psycho"" is truly one of the greats.Grade: A+",Psycho
40,AlsExGal,Always holds me from beginning to end...,10,25 March 2017,"...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.This is the rare example of a much-ballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises. The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the cliché) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns. Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the ""protagonist"" victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search. The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.This film is mentioned in the documentary ""Moguls and Movie Stars"" as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem. Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as ""man"" in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think.",Psycho
41,Uriah43,Awesome,9,14 December 2013,"An attractive woman by the name of ""Marion Crane"" (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her office then heads for California in a hurry. After being followed by a cop she pulls over at a used car dealership and trades her car for another before setting out again. That night it begins to rain hard and she decides to stay the night at a motel along an old highway-the Bates Motel. From that point on things begin to happen in a most dramatic fashion. Now, rather than reveal the details I will just say that this is one of the best horror movies ever filmed. It has good acting, good directing, excellent cinematography, plenty of mystery and awesome suspense. Along with that, one particular scene involving Janet Leigh in the shower is possibly one of the most memorable horror scenes ever filmed. Having said that I believe it should be pointed out that this movie is 53 years old (at the time of this review) and as a result it doesn't have the graphic imagery or gore that some people are accustomed to today. As a result there could be some viewers who might miss the subtle touches a real master like Alfred Hitchcock was able to implement to such a fine degree. Equally impressive was the acting of both Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (as ""Norman Bates""). As a matter of fact, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Academy Award and won a Golden Globe Award for ""Best Actress"" for her performance. In short, while this movie is definitely a bit old it is still worth watching for all fans of horror or suspense.",Psycho

43,bombersflyup,Quite the flickaroo.,10,1 November 2018,"Psycho is a journey of a film, flawed but remarkable the same.Going into the film, my only notion of what might transpire is the stabbing in the shower scene. That happens to be one the weakest parts though. The strength of the film is taking on many different forms and doing them well. A seemingly good woman stealing forty thousand dollars and on the run, to an off the beaten track motel and a murder, to a private investigator unsettling the killer, to a sister and boyfriend doing whatever it takes. Janet Leigh's excellent as the lead, though odd for her to die mid film. I wasn't surprised by the corpse, because they never showed the mother or the killer's face and it's a figure at the window mentioned more than once. Then for the sheriff to say she was dead, set that in stone. I had figured it was a voice recording talking to him. Lila had the option to go out the front door and chose the cellar when Bates went upstairs, just survive first and then come back jeez. The ending's in poor taste, as the loved ones don't want to hear why he's a freak and I didn't feel it necessary either.The highlights are the cop talking to Marion and then following her and Arbogast questioning Bates.",Psycho

The biggest impact featured here is the film's technical prowess since the Black & White cinematography is so gorgeous and so sparse in that we see so little that the suspense is just dripping off the screen. One of the best examples of this is the death of the investigating officer where he's just calmly walking up the stairs when we see a door open ever so slightly on the balcony unseen, and then the killer walks out and stabs him which causes him to fall down the stairs. The way that he falls is so creepy because he falls in such a supernatural way that it just sticks out in contrast to the rest of the material around it. It reaches the level of technical highlight just as much as the infamous shower scene that includes probably the most famous death scene in film history without violence or obvious nudity. The rest of the technical qualities here are just as impressive which really shows the genius was known for the time it was made where it is a sign of good filmmaking of giving the viewer just enough to give them a little jolt whenever it comes into question with the rest of the scene. Many people know of the relationship between Norman and his mother, and the very first time we know of her when he's talking about her in the parlor room is a perfect example of that which is one of the creepiest scenes by the way he's saying things and how he's saying them that something's off and yet he keeps an air of respectability that lends itself perfectly to his character and the relationship between them which is rather creepy. Even the motel where they're staying is like that. The dark interiors, the weird stuffed animals along the walls, and the secrecy that surrounds it is remarkable that most of the time we are wondering the secrets behind it. That allows the film to really get a lot of suspense out of so many scenes that it has the effect of being able to draw in a viewer and really highlights the fantastic work in the later half as the ruse is unveiled with the sequence down in the cellar. Armed with one of the finest and first twist endings in the genre, there's a lot to really love with this one that holds it up over the one main minor flaw. The biggest letdown from this one is the fact that the film does stumble a bit in the middle half where it slows down to a rather bland and sluggish pace as it focuses on her sister trying to find someone to go with her to look into the disappearance. These scenes don't really maintain the kind of impressive atmosphere or pacing that the rest of the film completely excels at. This one does slip down to a rather minor degree as the various starting points to the later half and it's not that enjoyable to sit through. As well as some obvious issues that are raised specifically about the time-period that don't apply to modern-day issues, there's not much wrong with this one at all.Today's Rating/PG-13: Implied Violence and off-screen Brief Nudity.",Psycho

47,The_Void,The master director's most important film?,9,7 October 2005,"There's no denying that Alfred Hitchcock is one of the true geniuses of cinema, and Psycho is his most popular film. Whether or not it's his 'best' is up for debate; but no matter what; it's definitely up there. Psycho is the film that inspired the entire 'slasher' sub-genre, and is also a textbook example of how to make a thriller. Every shot in the film is perfectly orchestrated, and by keeping the immediate action simple; the master director is able to fully focus on the proceedings, making the resulting film more thrilling. The influence that Psycho has had on cinema overall is astounding, and it's hard to imagine cinema now without this film. The fact that over forty years on, Psycho is still better than every film it influenced is no coincidence. The plot follows Marion Crane; an office worker who is entrusted with $40,000. Seeing her chance to escape her mundane life, she takes the money and runs. Unluckily for her, she stops at a small roadside motel; The Bates Motel. Managed by a quiet young man named Norman, the remote motel has more secrets than it's appearance suggests.Alfred Hitchcock creates a superb macabre atmosphere around the central location. Just the motel itself is frightening, without the rain effects and the psychopath that inhabits it. The master director has proved time and time again that he knows how to handle a movie; and the way that he orchestrates the surrounding here shows that implicitly. Everything about the plot is well worked, and the twist right at the centre of the film shows that. It's hard to carry off a twist like the one here and make it work, as the audience have put so much time and effort into the central character; but Hitchcock is more than equal to the challenge, and the way that he shifts the focus and still manages to retain all the intrigue is awesome to watch. The pivotal scene of the movie is, of course, the shower scene. The technicalities of this scene warrant the seven days that it took to film it, and the resulting montage represents some of the best footage ever to come out of Hollywood. I don't subscribe to the idea of 'less is more' usually, but the shower scene is so skilfully done that it's hard to not respect it.The central character of Norman Bates is, without doubt, one of the most frightening characters in cinema history. Unlike many of the resulting slashers' killers, Norman isn't overblown or even unrealistic; you can really imagine this character being real. Of course, the excellent performance by Anthony Perkins really adds to the character. There are some actors that were made by one role, and Perkins is one of them. The rest of the ensemble work brilliantly together, with Janet Leigh providing the central character until mid-way through, when Vera Miles steps in. It's a shame, really, that Psycho is so well known because now everyone knows it's twist, so it's hard to really enjoy the movie the way that it's intended. I knew the twist already before I saw the film for the first time - so it's lucky that the movie is so good, because otherwise, already knowing what happens could have spoilt it. Overall, there's a very good reason why Psycho is one of the most respected movies of all time. There are some films that you cant be a cinema fan without seeing - and this is one of them.",Psycho

She ends up at the Bates Motel operated by Norman Bates played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins. The rest of the cast is first rate like the wonderful Vera Miles as Lila Crane, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam as the private investigator. I believe the actor who Sam, Marion's cash-strapped lover, is also quite good in the role. Frank Albertson and Lurene Tuttle and Pat Hitchcock also round out a supporting cast.

The slow start where the characters not always, but usually doing something they should not dive into a scene where the audience get hit bam with a murder scene.

52,namashi_1,A Terrific Film!,9,3 August 2011,"'Psycho' is a Terrific Film, in all respects. It's chilling, it's captivating & it's memorable. Directed by Maverick Filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock, this 1960 classic, is indeed time-less!'Psycho' depicts the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, hiding at a secluded motel after embezzling money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner and manager, Norman Bates, played shockingly by Anthony Perkins, and the aftermath of their encounter. Adapted from the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' begins with a bang, and ends with some haunted images. Norman Bates is a person, who is described as disturbed & neglected. In my opinion, Norman Bates is a person, who became the animal he was, because he lost his innocence too soon. He wanted to live, but when he thought he couldn't survive anymore, he took up violence to breath. It's a twisted personality, that shocks you & leaves you numb!Joseph Stefano's Adpated Screenplay is nearly flawless. There is hardly a moment when the film loses it's momentum. Alfred Hitchcock's Direction is spell-binding. The master storyteller directs this psychological thriller, most convincingly. John L. Russell's Cinematography is chilling. Each Frame looks haunted. The Lens-Man has done a masterful job. Editing by George Tomasini, is superb! Art-Direction, is scary!Performance-Wise: Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, shockingly. What Perkins achieves by playing Norman Bates, is nothing short of an embodiment. Perkins performs as if Norman Bates, was actually waiting for him to play him on celluloid. It's a Hall-Mark Performance, that is above any praise! Janet Leigh is fantastic. Vera Miles, John Gavin & Martin Balsam leave a mark, as well. On the whole, 'Psycho' is much more than it's infamous shower scene. It's a film that leaves you haunted, with it's sheer power!",Psycho
53,JamesHitchcock,My Personal Favourite among Hitchcock's Work,10,24 July 2006,"The structure of ""Psycho"" can be likened to that of a three-act play. In Act I, Marion Crane, an employee of a real-estate company in Phoenix, Arizona, embezzles $40,000 belonging to a client of her employer in order to start a new life with her married boyfriend and goes on the run, ending up at a lonely motel. Act II deals with her stay at the motel and her conversations with its owner, Norman Bates, and ends with her murder in the famous shower scene. Act III deals with the investigations into Marion's disappearance, not only by the police but also by her boyfriend Sam, her sister Lila and a private eye named Milton Arbogast.Many people have felt that Act I, and indeed much of Act II, is a gigantic red herring. Certainly, Hitchcock seems to be leading us to believe that Marion is to be the central figure in this drama and the stolen money the ""McGuffin"" around which it will revolve. Her murder midway through the film must have come as a great shock to the audiences who watched the film in 1960, not only because the shower scene was, by the standards of the day, graphic in its depiction of violence, but also because the violent death of the central character so early in the film was almost unprecedented. Marion is young, attractive, blonde (like most Hitchcock heroines) and played by a major star; just the sort of film character one would expect to survive a murderous attack. Moreover, in Janet Leigh's portrayal she emerges as not altogether unsympathetic, despite her crime. One gets the impression that she is not, fundamentally, a wicked person and that she stole the money in a moment of madness. The man from whom she stole is a seedy sexual predator, seen flirting with her and making veiled sexual suggestions. When she is threatened by that sinister-looking traffic cop in his dark glasses, we are just praying for her to get away with it.This is probably the darkest of Hitchcock's films. Many of his films have a straightforward pattern of good triumphing over evil, ending with the villain dead or in police custody and the hero safe and free to marry the beautiful blonde heroine. ""North by North West"", the film which Hitchcock made immediately before ""Psycho"", and ""Spellbound"" are good examples of this pattern. In some films, such as ""Rebecca"", ""Notorious"" or ""Strangers on a Train"", there are elements of moral ambiguity, but in ""Psycho"" ambiguity seems to be replaced by a straightforward triumph of evil over good. Bates might end up under arrest, but not before he has murdered Marion and several other people.There is a clear contrast between this film and ""Spellbound"", another film which shows Hitchcock's fascination with psychology. In that film the character played by Ingrid Bergman is a ""healer of souls"", (the literal meaning of the Greek words from which ""psychiatrist"" is derived) a force for good who is able not only to cure Gregory Peck of his psychological traumas but also to clear him of unjustified suspicion of murder. In ""Psycho"" the psychiatrist is a more neutral figure, able to explain why Bates committed his crimes, but unable to cure him or to suggest how such crimes might be prevented.Yet on a deeper level there is more ambiguity about ""Psycho"" than appears at first sight. The character of Bates, with his split personality, symbolises the duality of good and evil in the human soul. Bates originally committed an evil crime- the murder of his mother and her lover- but has been driven mad by remorse. In his madness, the two aspects of his character have crystallised into two distinct personalities. His ""Norman"" personality (shown in a brilliantly subtle performance by Anthony Perkins) is that of a polite and inoffensive young man. His timidity, his apparent domination by his mother and his odd hobby of taxidermy might make him seem creepy, but never threatening. (His speciality is stuffing birds, and several examples of his handiwork decorate the motel, adding to the eeriness of the film and foreshadowing Hitchcock's next film, ""The Birds""). Bates has, however, unconsciously projected the evil side of his character onto his dead mother, and it is when the ""Mother"" personality takes over that he commits further evil deeds. One of the things that make the film so frightening is that the crimes are committed by a seemingly inoffensive character.These two aspects of Bates come out in his dealings with Marion. The ""Norman"" side befriends her, the ""Mother"" side kills her. Before she is killed, however, she is persuaded her she must return the stolen money. One of the last things she says is that she must return to Phoenix ""to get out of a trap I've gotten into"". Unwittingly, Norman has persuaded her to cleanse her soul. He destroys her physically, but might have saved her spiritually. If that seems an over-portentous interpretation of this film, we must remember that Hitchcock was brought up as a Catholic and that themes of sin and redemption play an important part in his work. (Think, for example, of ""I Confess""). There are also, of course, two sides to Marion, symbolised by the change in colour of her underwear from white to black after she has committed the crime.Two things remain to be mentioned. One is that harsh, driving Bernard Herrmann score which fits the mood of the film so well. The other is Hitchcock's direction and his use of black-and-white photography to convey a threatening mood. He said that he used black-and-white to make the film less gory; in fact, it seems far more eerie and frightening than a colour version ever could. (A pity that Gus van Sant did not understand that before embarking on his ill-advised remake). Overall, this is a superb chiller, undoubtedly the best ""slasher"" movie ever made and my personal favourite among Hitchcock's work. 10/10.",Psycho
54,Smells_Like_Cheese,One of the greatest horror/suspense films ever!,10,16 November 2002,"Alfred Hitchock is the master of suspense and Psycho is probably his most famous film. Because, let's face it, one way or another, you have seen or heard of this film. It's been made fun of, been remade(unfortunately), not to mention that this movie's word will be spred from generation to generation. I came across it very young, my parents used to tell me how scary it was and how I wouldn't want to take a shower after watching this film. I didn't believe them, but when I watched it, I for the first time pulled the blanket over my head, it was that frightening! The thing that is so amazing about Psycho is how much of an impact it made, and understandably why it did. It ranked in over 60 million dollars at the box office, now this was the time where tickets were like 50 cents at the theater, now if you compare that to today, that's Titanic like money! It broke many taboo's, like this was the first film to show a toilet being flushed, isn't that interesting? My high school teacher said that her and her mom saw Psycho when it was first released in theaters and she actually ran out of the theater terrified! Alfred did so well keeping us glued to our seats with all his great twists! This was before The Sixth Sense, I mean, the ending is just such a mind blower! But I won't give spoilers.Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, a woman who is in love with a divorced man Sam Loomis. He says once he pays his ex wife off with the alimony, they'll get married. When Marion's boss asks her to put their most valued client's money, $40,000 to be exact, and bring it to the bank. She has other plans though, she takes the money for herself and flee's the city, but not before her boss sees her driving off. Shaky enough, huh? But she pulls over to get a nap in, and a police officer asks if she's OK, but she gets shaky and just wants to drive off. The policemen fallows her since she is so shaky and she ends up buying a different car. She gets caught in a giant rainstorm and pulls over to the Bates Motel.She meets there, the owner, a pleasant and polite young man, Norman Bates. He lives in the house next to the motel with his mother. Marion checks in and Norman offers her dinner, they have a conversation mostly about his mom and Marion is concerned when she heard screams from the house that sounded like his mom. Norman gets on the defenses and asks Marion some questions as well, she says she is going to a ""private island"". Norman is very attracted to her, you can tell immediately, and she leaves knowing that she has to get out of the trap she set for herself back in Phoenix. As she's taking a shower before bed, a mysterious figure comes to the curtain and opens it stabbing Marion violently several times causing her to die. Norman cleans up the mess and gets rid of her body not knowing about her money and throwing that away too.Marion's boyfriend, Sam and her sister, Lola, hire a private detective to find her. The private detective comes across The Bates Motel and doesn't end up coming back after trying to ""talk"" to the mother. Lola and Sam are concerned and decide to investigate for themselves, but will they end up coming back to the city alive? Psycho is just one of those movies you have to see before you die. It's one of the most important films of our time and will never be forgotten. It's a true treasure with terrific actors and a terrifying plot that will give you nightmares for weeks! Please don't let that scare you, I'm just having fun, but it is a freaky film! Watch it in the dark! It has a better effect, I think. Over 40 years and this film is still horrifying as if it were made today! 10/10",Psycho
55,blanbrn,Hitch's best. One of the best and most memorable suspense thrillers in film history. Well liked for the famous shower scene.,10,19 December 2010,"""Psycho"" is without a doubt a classic film a suspense thriller that ranks well in memory it impacted cinema and pop culture it's a film that ranks as iconic history. When I first saw it I was even afraid to take showers as a kid! As the famous shower scene impacted me that much, and many people even had a phobia of staying in a motel after seeing this film classic. Later thru the years after countless viewings I adjusted and saw every moment of the film as pleasure as after I learned how the shower scene was shot I learned to appreciate cinema history and the techniques of how the shower scene was shot with superior montage editing.Alfred Hitchcock the master of thriller suspense had it all in ""Psycho"" the many themes present are lust, sex, embezzlement, greed, secrets, taxidermy, voyeurism, and a split personality which caused someone to cross dress as their dead mother! Aside from that the shower shower scene is memorable one of the most famous in film history and combined with the performances of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, ""Psycho"" is a memorable classic that a viewer can't get enough of.Set in Arizona it begins with Marion Crane(played so beautiful and very elegantly sexy by Janet Leigh a 60's screen siren. Plus it was a real treat to see Janet undress and sport that sexy black bra!)a woman who as a lonely secretary only has a hobby of being a sexy and elegant seducer of her boyfriend a man who's divorced. And Marion wants escape so one Friday afternoon after returning from lunch break when she receives a payment for her boss from a rich oil business man an ideal is sprung to mind. Marion will leave town only the money is not put in the bank it will take a journey ride with Marion to California. Interesting and very watchful along the way is the scenes of the deep voiced policeman who follows Marion a little distance, as I think Hitchcock used these scenes to show a viewer that Ms. Crane felt guilt about her exit.Only one rainy evening in California she drives upon the lonely Bates motel and this place feels different as it's clearly not what it seems. Attending is Norman Bates(wonderfully done and over the top by Anthony Perkins) who's a strange guy a shut in who tends to his old sick mother(supposedly)and Norman has a hobby of collecting dead birds! As he talks and checks Ms. Crane in Norman seems normal, yet he's anything but. Then shocking is when Marion gets settled in she tries to unwind and chill with a hot shower, only this is one shower that will spray out a sliced up death as it will become a blood bath! As Marion will clearly have her secrets washed away in blood.Many don't know the shower scene was shot from seventy different camera positions. As the montage editing is fantastic as the way the shots were linked together showing a certain form of art. This was adapted from the Soviet Union from the classic director Eisenstein as the clashing of images is graphic as it matches the film's shower scene so well. As each clashing scene the knife is shown going back and fourth from Leigh's body the images clash with blood showing the graphic side of life as this film has a bloody form of art. And most telling and chilling is the final shot when Janet falls as the blood drips down the tub drain showing her dead the drain symbolizes her life has indeed went down the drain! Really this is one scene I can go on and on about as if you know and study film their is always something you can find that the shower scene symbolizes and links to life and a graphic form of death. The scene was just so brilliant.So did Norman do it or was it mad mother who knows as Hitchcock tries to keep it a little suspenseful. Only you the viewer know the real shock poor Norman is a dressed up guy having a thing for women's wardrobe! Overall great suspense thriller classic from Alfred it proves we all have the right to go a little mad. It proves that you can't run from and hide your secrets. And when you arrive in a strange place you never know what to expect, as hidden secrets are present and they might just be stranger than yours just even mad and crazy! ""Psycho"" is one of the best films ever made.",Psycho
56,MovieAddict2016,"""Television has brought murder back into the home - where it belongs."" - Alfred Hitchcock",10,20 October 2003,"""Television has brought murder back into the home - where it belongs."" - Alfred HitchcockI am often asked what my favorite film of all time is. My reply is always the same: I do not have a favorite from all the genres. But from the thousands of films I have seen, I have not seen a film more horrifying nor terrifying as Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" the only movie that has ever truly scared me in my entire life. And so I can honestly say that ""Psycho"" is the scariest film I have ever seen, and is quite probably my favorite horror film of all time.This is the movie that redefined the genre, and literally gave birth to psychological thrillers. By today's standards, ""Psycho"" may seem - at the most -  tame. Audiences may not be scared by the plot anymore - a plot that was, at the time, unlike anything other, but nowadays quite normal. Gus Van Sant remade Hitchcock's classic in 1998 with both critics and audiences blowing it off. Modern audiences of today are used to slashers such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,"" etc., and so Van Sant's ""Psycho"" did nothing but disappoint them. But I guarantee that if you place modern audiences in front of Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" they will come out of the film terrified to death (like I was when I first saw it).Why is this? It is simply because modern audiences don't expect such creepiness and evilness to be in a 1960 film. Most modern audiences think that ""Star Wars"" (1977) was the start of motion picture history, that anything beforehand is stupid, cheery and not worth their time. They will go into Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" and expect a happy little picture, which is why they will come out pale with fear.It all comes down to the fact that in 1960, mainstream films did not have such subject matters as split personality disorder (seen in this year's ""Identity""), figures with homicidal tendencies (like John Doe in ""Se7en""), or characters who are literally insane (like Hannibal Lector-type-criminals). ""Psycho"" set the course for these films. It blew audiences out of the water. They had never seen anything like it before. It is probably the only film that has ever really, truly scared me to death. I didn't want to take showers for weeks.Hitchcock once said, ""Cartoonists have the best casting system. If they don't like an actor, they just tear him up."" I'm glad Hitchcock didn't try to tear up Anthony Perkins, who plays Norman Bates in ""Psycho,"" as a shy, awkward fellow living off of a re-routed highway. He is perfectly cast and soundly directed by Hitchcock, coming off as a somewhat strange, implacable fellow. We aren't quite sure what to make of him.Phoenix banker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a poor creature living off of practically nothing. She wants to get married to Sam Loomis (John Gavin), but the costs of a wedding outweigh both their incomes. And so one night when her employer entrusts Marion with 40,000 dollars, she flees with the money in the back of her car to go find Sam. However, tired from a long drive, she stops at the Bates Motel for the night. She never leaves the motel, because Norman Bates' reclusive mother becomes jealous of Marion and kills her. Or does she?Hitchcock masterfully weaves the suspense and horror in ""Psycho,"" so much so that we simply do not know what to think until everything unravels towards the end. The infamous shower scene remains one of the most impressive and wonderful segments in all motion picture history, ranking up there with the unveiling of Harry Lime in ""The Third Man,"" the revelation by Darth Vader in ""Star Wars,"" and one of my personal favorites, the part in ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" when Neal Page and Del Griffith wake up in bed entangled with each other. (""Those aren't pillows!"")I think that the anticipation of fear, or the insinuation of something sinister lurking behind a shadowed doorway, is much scarier than blood and guts. Freddy Krueger does not scare some people. Modern horror films tell us what we are supposed to fear, whereas films such as ""Psycho"" leave the images up to us. Not every person may leave a Jason Voorhees movie scared. Everyone will leave ""Psycho"" scared. Because as our mind tries to place a face on the fear, our mind incorporates our very fears into the image.Alfred Hitchcock is undoutedly one of the greatest and most influential film directors in the history of motion pictures. He can create suspense like no other and he can make even the simplest story the most nail-biting, terrifying picture of all time. I recently purchased a DVD with four of Hitchcock's early British films from the thirties, including ""The 39 Steps"" and ""The Lady Vanishes."" Hitchcock's sense of solid suspense can be felt even in those early films. He is, quite simply, the master of suspense. Is it no wonder he has gained the exact reputation as mentioned?Some films land on greatness and don't always deserve their reputation quite so much as everyone seems to think so. ""Psycho"" is not such a film. Here is a movie that bent and broke every set rule of film making for the time, and changed the course of horror films for the better. The nineties have shown a return to the classic horror/mystery/thriller mix of Hitchcock and Agatha Christie. Here is the granddaddy of them all. Here is the best horror film ever made.5/5 stars.John Ulmer",Psycho
57,DKosty123,Surprise Movie From The Master,10,25 June 2007,"Sir Alfred Hitchcock plays his audience like a fine instrument in this movie. He surprises at every turn. He layers some of the greatest suspense he ever put on film. This film will always have a place amongst the classic films.Despite it's greatness, this is the most humble of films. When Hitchcock made this film, he actually did it on the cheap. He used the summer vacation from his TV series & used his regular TV crew to film this. The cast agreed to work for little money.The genius in this movie is all Alfred Hitchcock. All he did was take an ordinary summer vacation, applied his genius to it, and produced an all time classic film. Hitch looked at this as a challenge. He wanted to prove it didn't take a bunch of money & a lot of studio smoke & mirrors to produce a great film. He succeeded beyond anyones wildest dreams.Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins will never be forgotten for their parts in this masterpiece. Nor should they be, for their performances sparkle. Janet only had to work a portion of that summer. Perkins summer performance would last the rest of his life.This is one of the first films to actually use a throne (toilet) in the film. Until Psycho, movies had never shown a toilet on screen & it is eerie how this throne comes on screen relating to the famous shower sequence. The 5 minute movie trailer with Alfred Hitchcock showing you around the Bates Motel set is a classic trailer for any film.Regardless, it is Sir Alfred who really brought all this into a great film. No one else could have done it better. This film proves it doesn't take money to make a classic, just genius. We just don't find much of that around these days.",Psycho
58,lasttimeisaw,Psycho,9,3 May 2011,"An untainted masterpiece, Hitchcock proves superbly that he had no impediments to conjure a classic B-movie like other lionized names like Roger Corman, George A. Romero and Russ Meyer etc., and all the more, he could outshine them by a notch.The film is an authentic template of a first-rate thriller/horror opus, which I will not bother to outline the details (for instance the over-examined bathroom slaughter scene) inasmuch as there are a wealth of professional dissertations everywhere in the digital era. I simply admire the dexterity of the film in exuding its horror-arousing atmosphere. Hitchcock manufactures one of the most disturbingly creepy-cum-maniac killer in the history of cinema. The Oedipus complex patient Norman Bates is a lively product of the hermetic seclusion amid people and a emblem of the loss of morality, also the kill-after-the-epiphany scenario has never blemished its charisma even after 50 years. The performance is uneven, in spite of the fact that the film earned the one-and-only BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS Oscar nomination for Janet Leigh (which sounds not equivalent to her monumental fame though), a leading-actress-goes-supporting set-up was an unanticipated stunt for its audience at that time, which is rarely seen presently. Anthony Perkins has such a multi-faced once-in-a-lifetime role and it would be an unforgivable sin if he had ruined it (two sequels PSYCHO II and III are perfectly justifiable spin-offs). Vera Miles, John Gavin plus other supporting roles, on the other hand, are the victims of Hitchcock's ""actor equals animal"" methodology, they are more like props than real flesh. Arguably this is my favorite Hitchcock's film right now, I think only VERTIGO (1958) and NORTH BY NORTHWEST (1959) might have the chance to overthrow it from the throne. I know it is definitely my fault and I still don't figure out how could I miss this two. P.S.: The top-notch status of the film intrigued a faithfully-copied remake by Gus Van Sant in 1998, whose ill-fated destination was preordained, which I am quite interested in as well after watching this original work.",Psycho
59,Rainey-Dawn,Norman Is Not Normal,10,2 July 2014,"I am not one that is into most slasher type of films but the ""Psycho"" film series has a very good interesting story and main character (Norman) from the first film to the very last movie. I love these movies.Psycho is most definitely a horror classic - I doubt most people would argue with that. It is a must see for those that love horror but have yet to view the film.Psycho is one of the creepiest movies I have ever seen in my life and I am not just talking about the infamous shower scene. The entire movie had an air of mystery and thrilling suspense from start to finish which added more to the horror, more than the shower scene.Even if you never knew that Norman was a ""Psycho"" killer the character would still seem bizarre. Norman seems normal when you first meet him on film, yet the more he speaks the more he seems strange, just weird when he talks - that alone is enough to scare the pants off of you! Then you factor in the fact he is in fact ""Psycho"" on top of it the movie becomes one of the all time scariest films ever! No, Norman is not normal.10/10",Psycho

61,OllieSuave-007,The movie that defines horror.,10,3 December 2013,"The only thing I remembered about this movie growing up was the famous shower scene, as it was the most disturbing and defining scene of terror I have seen at that time. I kept thinking to myself - that poor woman going through such pain and horror.I didn't see the entire movie until I was an adult, and it was better than I have expected - superb and believable acting; a plot full of suspense, intrigue and excitement; eerie and very haunting music; a fast-paced story; and unforgettable tastes of drama and pure horror.This movie is what I think is one of director Alfred Hitchcock's best work, a story about Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a Phoenix secretary who steals $40,000 from her employer's client so she could start a new life with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). While on the way to meet up with him, she checks into a remote motel run by the mysterious Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), whose life is apparently dominated by his mother's presence.For a movie made in 1960, it has stood well the test of time. ""Psycho"" is a movie that relies on the on-screen drama, suspense and mystery of the characters (and of course the shower scene) for its scare factor - minus the over-the-top gore/violence, silly humor and sex scenes you would normally see in teenage slasher movies or Friday the 13th and Elm Street-type flicks. We are asked to understand the struggles and eerie life Norman Bates go through and the vulnerability of Marion Crane. This movie appeared to be filmed with such ease and with the right amount of effort that it delivered an excellent motion picture - no overacting, no overdone effects, no over-the-top stuff - just the perfect balance for pure entertainment.Grade A",Psycho
62,Red-Barracuda,Psycho changed everything,10,28 March 2014,"You would have to say that Psycho was the start of something new. Alfred Hitchcock was at the height of his powers before he made it and it was only because of his standing that it was made at all. The studio was appalled by the idea of the film and released it very grudgingly and with the minimal of assistance. Hitchcock had to use much of his own personal wealth to fund it and released it in black and white, with a far lower budget than he was used to. Despite all this, when Psycho was released it changed everything.Released in 1960, it heralded the arrival of the 60's in more ways than simply date. It's extremely daring content was an early marker that indicated the coming changes in cinema. Sometimes people think that Hollywood truly changed in the late 60's with the release of Bonnie and Clyde. While it's impossible to argue against that film's influence, it can easily be argued that Psycho was even more ground-breaking and a full seven years older. Taking into account the cinema landscape of the time it was released, it's quite a wild uncompromising concoction that Hitchcock brought to the screen.There are several boundaries it pushed against. It opens with a scene of an unmarried couple – the woman partially undressed - in a hotel room just after sex. This was taboo at the time. Furthermore, the girl is introduced as the nominal heroine, even having her character's name displayed on the film poster. Yet she is brutally murdered less than half-way in. The disorientating nature of this is almost as shocking as the act of violence itself. Cinema audiences are just not prepared for a main character being disposed of like this. It throws us, confuses us and makes us realise we have no idea what is going to happen next. It's an utterly audacious move to do this and, incredibly, one that really has hardly been used since in the intervening fifty plus years. Hollywood still seems reticent in killing off its A-Listers in this way but Hitchcock was unafraid in subverting this 'rule' and the impact of Psycho is profoundly more effective as a result. Then there is the violence. The expertly filmed shower scene remains one of the ultimate shock moments in cinema and with some justification. For its time, it's incredibly brutal and it's here that Psycho pushed boundaries in the most direct and obvious way. In fact, Hitchcock partially decided on black and white, as he knew this scene would never get past the censors in colour. Now people died with their eyes open. Marion Crane stares at us dead on in a way that allows us little respite. And finally, there is the open depiction of sexually deviant behaviour. Normal Bates disturbing secret life is very psychologically dark, yet he is presented quite sympathetically. The direct presentation of these dark impulses was again quite unfamiliar to audiences of the time.The story has Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a secretary from Phoenix, Arizona, stealing $40,000 from her employer's client. After a couple of days on the run she ends up at a motel run by a nervous young man called Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). The structure of the narrative initially suggests that this will be a crime story of a woman on the run with a bag of money. But we have been cleverly misdirected and the seemingly standard thriller suddenly and jarringly changes into something altogether more sinister. Really, Psycho was a watershed movie in that it brought the horror genre into a recognisably real world. Beforehand, the genre always had the distance of either the supernatural or science fiction. Psycho stripped away this protective layer and in doing so made the horror more real and more terrifying. Amazingly, it has retained the palpable tension even today. This has ensured that it still feels quite modern and hasn't really aged at all. But it would be misguided to not acknowledge the black humour that is interspersed throughout and that only becomes apparent on re-watches. This is a result of a clever script but also excellent performances. The real stand-out dramatic scene being the late night supper between Crane and Bates, where there is such an uneasy and strange chemistry. Leigh and Perkins make this work so well; the latter is particularly brilliant in this film. So good it would unfortunately type-cast him forever.There are other collaborators too who need to be acknowledged too. Firstly, there is Saul Bass who is the legendary credit sequence guy. His work here is pretty simple and straightforward but striking nevertheless. And then there is, of course, Bernard Herrman whose score is one of the greatest in cinema history. Everyone knows the famous screeching that accompanies the murders – rightfully so because it's genius – but the melodic main theme is quite beautiful and truly evocative. But in the final analysis the bulk of the praise has to go to Alfred Hitchcock, as this incredibly provocative work of cinema art would never have been made without him and I think it stands as his greatest achievement.",Psycho
63,sddavis63,I Didn't Think It Lived Up To Its Reputation,6,1 June 2011,"""Psycho"" has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest of horror movies, and even if you've never seen it (which I hadn't until today) you still feel a certain connection to the movie just on the basis of its reputation. That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical ""Hitckcock-ian"" touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were ""horrific"" - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it. (6/10)",Psycho
64,thesar-2,"The Original and Best ""Wrong Turn"" Movie",10,2 November 2009,"(Spoilers – in fact, this movie should be watched by all before any reviews read. Experience it first and then learn so much more.) It pained me when I heard that M. Night Shyamalan compared himself to Alfred Hitchcock. Where Shyamalan's movies are simply dreadful, half-assed, slow and contain hilariously bad scripts, Hitchcock remains the master no matter what year you watch his films. 'Psycho' is my all-time favorite Hitchcock film, and one of the best suspenseful movies of all time. It has such depth, both the intriguing (even today) story and characters, never a dull moment was experienced here. And talk about before his time; this movie was ingenuous: The main character is not only enormously flawed (a Hitchcock staple, and one I love so much about his films – see: 'The Birds') but she dies half-way through the feature, leading the way to another, more iconic main character: Norman Bates. I personally wasn't around in 1960, but I'm sure this caused quite a stir with its graphic scenes (by today's standard, this is PG) but I'm glad they didn't just go for the gore. The story, acting, cinematography, and especially the incredible score, were all brilliant. Everything about this movie is excellence, and I am glad that this and that famous shower scene is studied in film classes. This is what movie-making is all about. Marion is attempting to ""escape"" with the man she loves by stealing $40,000 to pay off his debts. Though her ""inner-voice"" gnaws away at her since the theft, just as her conscious gets to her, Bates and his mental illness (shown superbly and believably by Perkins) puts an end to that. Everything works in this masterpiece. In fact, books could be written about all the angles this took, and I'm sure they have been.Side Note: I live in Phoenix, AZ, and despite it being hot for a good 6-7 months out of the year, it's rarely, make that, I've never experienced a hot day in mid-December like they supposedly said it was in this film. Perhaps they made it in the summer, or they've never visited Phoenix before and assumed it's always hot. That is the only ""flaw"" I detected in this excellent film, and even that's really no big deal.",Psycho
65,sol1218,Are there still any vacancies at the Bates Motel?,9,31 October 2004,"(Some Spoilers) Alfred Hitchcock's classic horror thriller about murder and madness at the deadly and infamous Bates Motel managed by the weird but seemingly harmless son of the motel owner Mrs. Bates Norman, Anthony Perkins. The film ""Psycho"" starts out inside a darkened hotel room on a broiling Friday afternoon in December in the city of Phoenix Arizona. Marion Crane and Sam Loomis, Janet Leigh and John Gavin, have just finished off an afternoon quickie as they both get dressed to get back to their individual jobs after their lunch break. Depressed at having to meet and make love in the secrecy of a hotel room instead of at home like a married couple is getting both Marion and Sam very upset but they don't have the money to get married as well as raise a family. With Marion having a job as a secretary and Sam as a warehouse manager and also being very deeply in debt. Marion later that afternoon is called into the office of her boss George Lowery, Vaughn Taylor, and given some $40,000.00 in cash from a client of his Tom Cassidy, Frank Albertson,to put away at the local bank for the weekend. It's then that something clicks in Marion's mind where she decides to steal the money and use it to skip town and later marry Sam. Trading in her old car for a new one at a car dealership with $700.00 of the stolen cash Marion drives out west to California and as night falls it starts to rain very heavily and with the visibility next to zero she goes off the main highway on to a small country road that leads to the Bates Motel. Getting a room from Norman Bates at the motel Norman starts to become friendly and falls for the pretty sweet as well as obviously distressed Marion. This makes Norman's old and infirm mother Mrs.Bates very angry with him for not paying any attention towards her. Mrs. Bates also develops a very vicious and violent hatred towards Marion for what she thinks is her stealing Norman away from her.Later in her motel room Marion has seconds thoughts about her taking the $40,000.00 and plans to return it the next day to her employer back in Phoenix after having a good nights sleep at the motel but the bitter and vengeful Mrs. Bates has other ideas. Horrific film that has you at the edge of your seat and by the end falling off it. With the murderous Mrs. Bates on a knife wielding rampage attacking and slashing Marion as she's taking a shower leaving her to bleed to death on the floor of the bathtub. The shower scene is one of the most terrifying horror sequences ever put on film. The scene slowly builds itself up as the crazed Mrs. Bates enters Marion's room and creeps up to her in the shower. Quickly pulling the shower curtains apart Mrs. Bates lays into Marion with a large kitchen knife that had people in movie houses back them, 1960, choke on their popcorn and candy bars. Alfred Hitchcock set the scene up in a deliberately slow and deadly pace but when it exploded it left those watching, like poor Marion, in a state of first shock and then sheer terror. Even more effective, but not as popular with the movie going public, is when Mrs. Bates confronts private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), who was hired to find Marion,at the top of the stairs in the Bates house. All at once when you, and Det. Arbogast, never expected it Mrs. Bates lashes her knife into Det. Arbogast face cutting it open. As Det. Arbogast falls to the bottom of the staircase Mrs. Bates pounces on him, like a cat, and savagely finishes him off. This all happened so fast that you, like Arbogast, didn't even have enough time to anticipate it which made it that much more effective. It later turns out that the insane Mrs. Bates had already murdered a number of people, before she murdered both Marion and Det. Arbogast, over the years and had them and their cars sunk in a nearby lake with the help of her willing son Norman to hide the evidence. The shock to end all shocks comes near the end of the movie when Marion's sister Lila, Vera Miles, goes down to the basement of the Bates house and finds out just who and what Mrs. Bates really is and who was the real person behind the bloody and brutal murders at the Bates Motel.",Psycho
66,ElMaruecan82,"An ""accidental"" masterpiece ... and the greatest suspense movie ever ...",9,21 March 2011,"Imagine if Hitchcock retired before the 60's, after all, his filmography was impressive enough to place him among the all-time greatest film-makers. But the Master had a little surprise for those who thought they've been scared enough and could never be surprised again  And how wrong they were  It's admirably surprising that such a great film came so lately in a career when most of the directors generally start losing their touch. But this is only one of the numerous unexpected and fascinating aspects that make this simple film, an ""accidental"" masterpiece. And I use this word as a compliment since the greatest masterpieces like ""Casablanca"" or ""The Godfather"" were unintentional too.The elements that make ""Psycho"" a masterpiece could have been taken as cinematic tricks deliberately inserted to create a feeling of originality, but then, such tricks would have sublimated the film, making it even more glorious and 'cinematic', which is not the case here. And I think I loved ""Psycho"", for the same reasons I disliked ""North by Northwest""  In the former, Hitch used up all the style until it became a caricature: a too contrived plot, a too heroic ordinary hero, a dull love interest, a grandiose climactic scene  ""Psycho"" doesn't have this pretentious elegance and almost looks like a TV or a B-movie  it's the less Hitchcokian stylishly, but ironically, the most defining of his films.""Psycho"" starts with probably the most thrilling score ever, the linear design combined with the shrill violins' sounds are the perfect illustration of how a music can embody the main feeling of a film, as if Bernard Herrman is already warning us about a horrifying surprise that'll make our hearts pound as fast as this melody  its contribution to the film's emotional impact is indisputable. The next shot transports us to Marion Crane's apartment where we she lies in bed with her lover, undressed and intimate like in a campy soap opera  a lousy apartment with two people without the 'Grant and Kelly' romantic appeal audience got used to. An already classic and politically incorrect start. They're lovers, who probably just had sex, but this is no voyeurism, this is intimacy, a necessary intimacy to feel for Marion, to understand her, to understand her motives for stealing the money in the following scene.Indeed, the way, Janet Leigh portrays Marion Crane, and Hitchcock's intimate directing, creates an incredible feeling of empathy leading to paranoia. When Marion leaves the town, we don't know where she goes exactly, but we're following her totally hooked, like hostages of her fate. When she accidentally meets her boss, we're shocked  and feel her slow descent to paranoia, from the discussion with the police offer, to the car rental service where every hint of nervousness acts like an accusation. That's the brilliance of Hitchcock's script, at that point: there's just the robbery, and Marion's troubles. We fear that she might get caught, totally unaware that this option would have saved her life.The rest is legendary; she meets Norman Bates, a young, easy-going and soft-spoken Motel manager, with nothing suspicious in his approach. He's a bit shy and awkward but this only highlights his 'boy-next-door' attitude. Of course, there's this strident voice that shouts at him every time, those stuffed birds, but when you live alone in such a little and boring place, one must find hobbies. Marion is too exhausted anyway to get suspicious and Anthony Perkins's great acting doesn't suggest the idea, even for us, that he's trying to seduce her, although, they're like forming a cute couple, and we almost expect something happening between them, until Bates reveals to be a voyeur, which shocked me as if I was so close to Marion, I felt like Bates spying on me.We all know the rest of the story, what else can be said? The shower scene is probably the most audacious and shocking plot twist ever committed on screen. It's extraordinary that the character that was driving the film was killed so early. Marion Crane wasn't a supporting character, she was the lead of the first part of the film, and the transfer from Crane to Bates as the new lead of the film is masterfully done. Especially that at this point, Norman Bates is not the official villain of the film, it's like we feel some sympathy for him as he tries to protect his evil mother. We need to feel empathy anyway.But Hitchcock had to surprise us. The film doesn't have one twist but in fact two twists including the classic, shocking revelation of the mother's identity, a shock starting with the sudden appearance of the skull, even scarier than the shadowy figure behind the curtains. This conclusion is the pay-off of a rather normal part between Marion's murder and the climax, saved by a scene-stealing performance by Martin Balsam as Detective Arbogast, a supporting but pivotal character whose annoying perseverance will indirectly solve Marion Crane's disappearance mystery. The film could have disappointed after Marion's death, the shocking revelation places it among the greatest classics.And one thing prevented the film from being perfect, and I can't understand how a director like Hitchcock let himself tolerate such amateurish writing. I'm talking of the shrink scene where during 5 minutes, the characters and the audience make one and quietly listen to Bates' biography, as a text, the screenwriter probably wrote before starting the script. It's like Hitchcock underestimated his audience's intelligence. Didn't we have enough hints? Wasn't the last scene meaningful enough to understand that he suffered from a personality disorder? Thankfully, ""Psycho"" overcame many flaws and managed to be the greatest suspense movie ever, thanks to a constant paranoid feeling, two shocking twists, a memorable villain, and an unforgettable score. ""Psycho"" is an accidental masterpiece, but it's still a masterpiece",Psycho
67,MOscarbradley,The greatest film ever made,10,12 September 2006,"Hitchcock's greatest film, an adroit blend of grizzly horror, crazy pop psychology and clipped social satire, is about a girl called Marion Crane, (Janet Leigh in a career-defining performance), who takes the money (her employers) and runs all the way to the Bates motel where ... well, if you haven't seen it and really don't know the plot, I won't spoil it for you, suffice to say at which point it becomes a movie about a boy called Norman, (Anthony Perkins in one of the greatest pieces of screen acting ever; like Anthony Quinn's Zorba, Perkins was doomed to play Norman for ever more).Dismissed by serious critics at the time, (for it's violence, for it's cheap, tawdry milieu - talk about pulp fiction - and for what they saw as Hitchcock's degeneration into what now would be dubbed the slasher movie genre), it is now widely regarded as a masterpiece, a brilliant fusion of technique and content, drawing us first into Marion's world, then dismissing her as fatuously as Antonioni did with his heroine in ""L'Avventura"", before creating in Norman one of the most multi-layered characters in all cinema and finally 'explaining' the whole plot in a totally audacious coda. Even without the shock element the film repays repeated viewings and was needlessly remade by Gus Van Sant, virtually frame by frame and in colour, and which should be avoided at all costs.",Psycho
68,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The master of suspense turns in one of his greatest efforts.,9,11 May 2018,"Though a shift in focus at the half-way point slows the up-until-then taut pacing, this expertly directed feature is suspenseful and mysterious throughout. 'Psycho (1960)' is extremely unconventional, too. Its writing is simply fantastic. It feels as though the film it wanted to be is callously cut down at its mid-point, forcing it to follow a new and altogether darker path. An epilogue exposition sequence feels somewhat tacked-on, but it provides insight into a key character's psyche and arguably enhances what comes before it. There picture is full of great performances, including a masterful turn by Anthony Perkins, and Bernard Herrmann's score really is phenomenal. Hitchcock truly is the master of suspense and this is one of his greatest efforts. 9/10",Psycho
69,gbill-74877,Masterpiece,10,16 November 2019,"A masterpiece, and for my money, one of the greatest films of all time. From the moment Hitchcock tells us it's 2:43 pm and Janet Leigh's character skipped even eating her sandwich to spend three hours in carnal bliss with John Gavin's, to that penultimate shot on Anthony Perkins with a twisted smile on his face, it's quite simply one five star scene after another.The tension never lets up, there is that extraordinary shift from one main character to another mid-film, and there is more than one misdirection that keeps the first-time viewer guessing. The voyeur scene, the abrupt killing of a main character, and the entire concept of the mental condition were all very original in 1960.The cast is fantastic, from Perkins (who should have gotten an Oscar) and Janet Leigh (easily my favorite Hitchcock lead actress) all the way down to that cop who stops for Leigh and then later stares at her so perfectly from across the street while she's with the used car dealer.There are so many other little moments of tension: Leigh's employer seeing her in her car when he thought she was going home, the car that doesn't sink into the swamp all that easily, and the searches into the ominous old house. There are also those big moments too, a couple of which need to be included in any discussion of the greatest scenes in film history. The other aspects of the film keep up too - the score is brilliant, and Hitchcock gets plenty of great shots, including the one from the underside of Perkins's face while his jaw twitches nervously and many others. It's hard to imagine a better executed film, and this is one that I never get tired of watching.",Psycho

I even would like to have seen her and that weird son become a couple if she didn't get killed off so soon. Sure, she escaped to have a new life, why couldn't she go out with guys again?

74,inkblot11,"A classic in chills and creepiness, nuf said",10,3 July 2019,"Marion (Janet Leigh) works for a real estate agent and earns, most likely, very little bucks in the late fifties. She loves a handsome gentleman named Sam (John Gavin) but, alas, his divorce has left his prospects dim, as a good deal of his money goes to his ex-wife. In fact, he lives in another California town, behind the hardware store he runs. Marion is getting tired of meeting Sam in cheap hotels and listening to his weak promises. One day, a crooked businessman comes in with $40,000 cash for a house he is buying for his daughter, who is marrying soon. Marion's boss is aghast to hold this much money so he sends Marion to the bank on a Friday afternoon. The money never gets deposited. Going a bit ""crazy"", Marion takes the cash and runs north, thinking this will allow Sam to marry her. But, a heavy downpour makes Marion stop at an out-of-the-way motel, The Bates. Greeted by the motel's owner, Norman ( a superb Anthony Perkins), Marion soon learns she is the only guest and is given the best room. Norman even brings her a meal, over the objections of his mother, who Marion sees in a window and hears from the 'big house"" behind the motel. After she eats, Marion decides maybe she should take the money back in the morning and steps into the shower. Suddenly and ghastly, Marion is stabbed to death by, its assumed, Norman's mother. Norman cleans the place up and sinks Marion's car, along with the money, into a pond near the motel. All too soon, Sam and Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) are looking for her. A private eye goes snooping, too, hired by the man with the bucks, for he can't notify the police. When the PI gets to the Bates, Norman's mother makes short work of him, too. Another car goes swimming and sinks. But, when Sam and Lila likewise trail Marion to the Bates, will more deaths ensue? Is there bigger secrets afoot? You bet! This classic tale of a psychosis and murder is rightly one of Hitchcock's most famous films. DEFINITELY SCARIER THAN SCARY, many folks never take a shower again after viewing it. Perkins is beyond great as the weird Norman and Leigh, Gavin, and Miles do their parts quite nicely. The twist at the end is compelling while, even in black and white, the film's production is stunning. Don't miss this one if you dare!",Psycho
75,Bored_Dragon,Why does the detective every time leave the car through the passenger door?,7,27 November 2019,"When I first saw this movie, I didn't like it. I was bored, and I think I rated it six out of ten. But I was younger, with less film experience and much less patience. Therefore I decided to give it another chance.Nominated for four Oscars, Alfred Hitchcock's horror thriller ""Psycho"" is considered one of the best films of all time and one of the most influential films in the genre. The oldest R-rated movie can also be found on the lists of the most controversial films because, in its time, it was something new and shocking. Frankly, I was a little bored. Although technically well-made, with great camera, music, and performances by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, the story and overall atmosphere made no special impression on me. The introductory part, until Marion arrives at the motel, was needlessly dragged on for half an hour and, after hundreds of watched thrillers and horrors, neither did the rest of it particularly hold my attention. With all due respect for the status of this film, its impact on the history of cinema, the cult scene in the shower and one of the most legendary twists of all time, my subjective impression does not allow me to rate it higher than7,5/10",Psycho
76,ironhorse_iv,I'm a little bit psycho for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho. It's amazing!,9,26 June 2013,"Some critics believe 'Psycho' to be Director Alfred Hitchcock's Magnum opus. In my opinion, it's an masterpiece that set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films. Even before the 1960's, Alfred Hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense and perhaps the best-known film director in the world at the time. This movie just add to it with subliminal themes, subtext and images. The center theme of Psycho is the concept of multiplies identifies where characters are challenge to live through life under multiplies roles. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is just that type of a character. She is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and living in a double life with her affect with strong will Sam Loomis (John Gavin). One day, Marion is given money to be deposited in the bank. Instead of depositing it, Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her love affair Sam. Rather than meeting Sam, she finds a nervous charming innkeeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) at the Motel, she was staying. He was control by his over demanding mother. Anthony Perkins gives a subtle performance here. She is taken by Norman Bates innocent charm, as she sees him as the fragile alter-ego of Sam. In many ways, Norman Bates and Sam have very similar stories, the only different is that Norman can't live without her mother, while Sam can. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, as the shower scene is probably the film's most famous sequence. In a way, the shower scene was like baptismal waters. Marion had decided to go back, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she cleaning herself of sin. I like the fact that Marion's underwear is white before the theft, and black after. Feeling in rage that Marion might steal Norman away from her when Marion suggests to Norman that he put his mother in a mental hospital, her mother strikes Marion, only for Norman to cover it up. When Marion goes off missing, her personality live on with her double, twin sister Lila Crane (Vera Miles) who finds herself staying at the Bates motel, just like her long-lost sister. I love how Hitchcock utilized and probably was the first to establish the writing technique of the false protagonist. The false protagonist is when the viewers are introduced to a character that supposed to be the main character, only to be removed from the story either by death or other means early in the film. By removing Marion Crane from the story, early on. It might offend Janet Leigh's fans, but Alfred Hitchcock's know what's for the best. One of the best image scenes are the mirrors in why show that the characters have multiply personality. Another running theme is the money. The stolen money that Marion carries about with her represents her dirty little secrets. Hitchcock goes so far as to symbolically link this pile of money to a pile of feces. Every talk about money is weaved into dialogue about how filthy it is. While the showing scene can be seen as erotica for Norman Bates; Norman Bates mother sees it as filth. Contrary to a widely told tale, Hitchcock did not arrange for the water to suddenly go ice-cold during the shower scene to elicit an effective scream from Leigh. But Hitchcock did tested the shock value of Mother's corpse by placing it in Leigh's dressing room and listening to how loud she screamed when she notice it there. Compare to Modern Day Slasher films, this film is really tame of violence. The film was known to be nauseating for some viewers at the time, even with it being shot in black and white. The novel is more brutal than the film version. It had a beheading no less in it. Alfred Hitchcock cut it out, and did stabbing instead. Even with its graphic nature, the ""shower scene"" never once shows a knife puncturing flesh. Alfred Hitchcock desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory so he film the movie in black and white, while also trying to cut cost down. I think, the biggest reason why it is in black and white is because it's better for horror films with the use of shadows. While it is tame, the movie is still disturbing. Hints why the film still have the Rated R label. What might bizarre is how often the film talks about eating. Considering that the writer of the original book, Robert Bloch based his story loosely upon the activities of serial killer and cannibal Ed Gein, some of these constant references to eating could simply be a sly reference to cannibalism. One subliminal theme of Psycho is when Norman chats to Marion about his hobby of taxidermy. It's remind us another Hitchcock classic movie 1963's The Birds. By having Marion eat like a bird, and having a last name like a bird. No wonder why Norman wants to eat her all up, but Norman couldn't hurt a fly or could he. That's actually a form of symbolism. The soundtrack of screeching violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled ""The Murder"" is amazing. It works for the film so well. This film sequels that followed in 1983 are just mediocre at best. There was also a 1998's remake of the film with Director Gus Van Sant that was God awful. 2012 and 2013 was a big high for Psycho fans as Bates Motel started to aired on A&E. Anthony Hopkins star in 2012 film Hitchcock about filming the movie, and also a HBO telefilm call 'The Girl"" with Toby Jones as Hitchcock during the filming of this movie, Psycho.",Psycho

83,Dr_Coulardeau,God is paranoid and Satan is psychotic,10,23 January 2009,"This black and white film needs that black and white artistic elaboration to find its complete value. We are entering a progressive descent into some kind of hell but we go down one step at a time without knowing there will be more steps after this one. This descent is represented in the film by the steps going up to the house behind the motel, then the steps going up and down from one level of the cabins to the next, then the staircase inside the house going up to the rooms but also going down to the fruit cellar. This image, which is a metaphor of the mind when it is swallowed up by insanity, is essential and cannot be in color because an insane mind is a whole set of hues and shades of grey. But Hitchcock in this case constructs the plot itself that way. Sexual temptation for the boy friend, then mutual and reciprocal financial temptation for the money and the girl, then the run, the escape. And then one step at a time the trail is getting hotter and hotter. The boss seeing her driving out of town. The cop finding her asleep in her car on the shoulder of a road. The cop following her and observing her swapping her car for another. The motel to escape the rain and get some rest. The sandwich and the milk, the discussion and the mental trap for her, the poor thief, and for him the poor surviving son. And you can go on and on and that will lead you to the end, but with only one question in your mind. How is it possible that such doom can fall upon someone? But who is that someone? The son, Norman Bates, a killer of his own mother and her lover who was left free to survive in society? The poor thief Marion Crane who was trusted with the un-trustable, so much money that her jaws fell down? There is in this film, maybe more than in most Hitchcock's films, the sense of some kind of doom or fate or destiny governed and controlled by some kind of insane authority. Hitchcock was showing then the God he never alluded to in this film that was governing this world must have gone not AWOL as some may say but insane, frankly schizophrenic. For this sinister world to make sense, you need to state that the master mind of our cosmos is a double personality, good old god on one side and good old Satan on the other side and the fight between the two are not even close to the beginning of an end and our lot will be like that tossed from the benevolent hand of god into the malevolent hand of Satan and/or vice versa as many times as these two will find some pleasure in doing so, as long as we will not cut the branches and the roots of this divine and devilish schizophrenia that is finding its source in our very flesh and mind and that is outsourced by our spirit or brain into some autonomous though totally virtual, an absolute simulacrum, of reality, an outsourcing movement that gives us the illusion of sanity paid for by that mental and spiritual alienation that the invention of these two supernatural beings represents for us. Better be alienated in spirituality than divided in reality. That explains so well the fact that such lines of thinking and representing our own experiential life can lead to all kinds of possible bigotry and fundamentalism, as soon as we decide we are standing on the only side worth it, that is to say the side of good, the side of god, the side of light, without understanding that there are so many shades of light and so many hues of shade that if we all stand one-sided and one-spirited and one-minded for what each one of us consider as pure light we are absolutely doomed to commit our daily genocide every day between our morning shower and our breakfast, just as an appetizer for our day of labor. And Hitchcock builds that fate upside down for the poor Marion Crane: the genocide of Norman Bates' mother happens between Marion Crane's evening snack and her before-going-to-bed shower, a shower she will never finish taking and that will be turned into a long bath in some muddy pond. The final and concluding image of the car containing the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life. He even imposes onto us a five minutes psychological ranting discourse from the local psychiatrist to convince us that all is normal since everything is upside down, but is it? Is it not the reverse: everything is upside down since all is normal, or is it everything is normal because all is upside down, or whatever? Add a touch of color to that film and you will produce a big meaningless mess. Black, white and grey become death so well, just like mourning becomes Elektra.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Psycho
84,zkonedog,Very Different From The Rest Of The Hitch Collection,10,8 March 2017,"There is no debating that ""Psycho"" is one of the classic psychological thriller movies of all-time. Some might say that it even invented the genre. What is perhaps even more interesting, however, is how different this film is from the rest of Alfred Hitchcock's directorial efforts--and different for the better.For a very basic overview, ""Psycho"" sees young secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steal a large sum of money from her employer in hopes of starting a new life with boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). While escaping the city in the dead of night (and the pouring rain), Crane pulls into the Bates Motel, owned and run by one Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). What Marion, as well as a private investigator (Martin Balsam) and Lila Crane (Vera Miles) later on, discovers is that Norman is hiding a deep and terrible secret revolving around his beloved ""mother"".In most other Hitchcock movies, the plot revolves around some sort of MacGuffin, or object that pushes the plot along. In short, less plot-heavy and much more a showcase of the stars, styles, and tropes of the time they were made. ""Psycho"" initially looks to be much of the same, what with the money that Marion steals pushing the action in the early goings. But then she makes that fateful turn into the parking lot of the Bates Motel and everything changes. From that point, the film swiftly pivots into a master class on the building of mystery, tension, and intriguing characters. In other words, it becomes a true psychological thriller that holds up 60 years (at this writing) after its theater debut.Front and center in this genre transformation is Perkins' performance as Norman Bates, easily one of creepiest (and thus most iconic) acting jobs in cinema history. The way he turns on a dime from jocular goofball to menacing madman is truly a sight to behold. Norman's characterization has to be absolutely perfect to sell the big twist at the end, and Perkins nails every scene.In a historic sense, ""Psycho"" is also a landmark film for some of the material portrayed on-screen (at least at that time). From the small stuff (the first time a toilet was ever shown flushing on the big screen, believe it or not) to the infamous shower scene and cross-dressing, Hitchcock was far ahead of his time with this one. During an era when the cinema was still considered family-entertainment diversion, for the most part, he provided perhaps the first true chilling experience sitting in a theater seat.Even more impressive about ""Psycho""? Sometimes, when any film achieves such a high degree of popularity, it loses a bit of its edge because every scene, character, and line gets dissected a thousand times over. In this case, though, ""Psycho"" can be watched at fairly regular intervals without getting too stale. Hitch's masterful directing probably has a lot to do with this. Even if you know what is coming (and most people by now do), it is still creepy and compelling.In short, ""Psycho"" is a seminal film of American cinema for its character studies and raw thematic material when its contemporaries, generally speaking, were much lighter and sometimes little more than vehicles for their stars. Whether the first time or the twenty-first time watching this gem, you will pick out ""just one more thing"" that amazes you, as well as experience that ""creepy-crawly"" feeling regarding the goings-on at the Bates Motel.",Psycho
85,poe426,Master Moviemaker Makes Murder Masterpiece...,10,18 July 2014,"When one considers the fact that PSYCHO is based on the depredations of Ed Gein (by way of Robert Bloch), it's almost impossible to imagine that even as great a Movie Maestro as Alfred Hitchcock could turn it all into such a stylish and suspenseful masterpiece. But he does. (Let's not forget to give credit where credit is due: Robert Bloch is the man whose imagination transformed the ghoul Gein into Norman Bates; Stephano fashioned his scenario from the novel.) For those who aren't familiar with Gein, he was a cannibal necrophiliac who wanted to be a woman- his mother in the book and in the movie, but female, period, in real life. He would actually dress up in a ""suit"" made of a woman's skin and dance around his deserted farmhouse at night. (I've always loved the song DANCIN' IN THE MOONLIGHT by King Harvest, but whenever I think of Ed Gein these days- which ain't often-, I think of that song...) THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE was also based on Gein's atrocities and comes closer, I think, to the real horror of what he did, but Bloch and Hitchcock first separately and then combined turned it into one of the Truly Great Murder Movies- one for the ages.",Psycho
86,johnnyboyz,The horror and the terror combining on a broad canvas of genre manipulation; psychoanalysis and deconstruction of an archetype in what most say is Hitchcock's best.,8,21 May 2009,"Similarly to a lot of films from decades-past, nothing anybody here, or anywhere else, says about certain films will alter their status as ground breaking, or influential in certain aspects, pieces of cinema. Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is one of those such films, a film that put paid to an entire era and mindset in American cinema; a film that defied grammar and construction and went all out in its deconstruction of both genre and issues of censorship. A film made by a man usually uttered within the same breath as both Kubrick and Welles when it comes to the film-makers that shaped cinema in its first full century as an existing medium. Most will say Psycho is Hitchcock at his best, and you'd be hard pressed to disagree with them.Essentially, Psycho is a film that covers a fair degree of psychoanalysis going on within a close knit locale. The majority of the film is dominated by a certain Norman Bates (Perkins), a young man whose mother still has a grip on him as he attempts to live whatever pitiful existence he has. Bates will predominantly inhabit one of either two spaces, briefly breaking off to inhabit a rural, swamp locale for the dumping of a car. The predominant two are a cabin, complete with motel rooms and an office as well as his house on the hill which he 'shares' with his mother. Something that Hitchcock does to a very basic level with these seemingly innocent, everyday locations is turn them into spaces of the 'uncanny' variety. That is to say, at a time when Hollywood's studio system permitted definitive genres to be shot on certain sets well suited to the genre film being made, (a mad scientist's laboratory for horror or the inside of a space ship for a sci-fi) Hitchcock manipulates offices and houses and other such 'spaces' and turns them on their heads for what the locations initially demand you produce there.But the toying with the genre isn't limited to just this. The set up involves a certain Marion Crane (Leigh) and the theft of a large amount of money from her boss. What is set up as a road movie, in which we might assume chase to be the primary narrative drive, turns into something completely different. Initially, the film is driven by a woman. Marion is presented in a less than flattering light, established at the very beginning when it appears she has spent the entirety of her lunch break with another man out of wedlock. Following this is the theft and the complete disregard for authority and her own safety when it transpires she sleeps in her car and very quickly tries to get rid of a police officer when he questions her.For this passage of film, Psycho relies on its suspense revolving around whether Marion will be caught as would-be lines of dialogue are exchanged within Marion's mind to do with what her peers are debating back at her work. What we assume will be a (routine?) chase film-come-thriller as her boss strives to get his money back will become something else entirely, aptly marked at a certain point in the film in which special attention is given to the removing of the money from the piece. Following this, a new plot drive, indeed protagonist, takes over the reigns of the film and it branches out into a different beast.I suppose we are meant to consider Psycho a horror piece, despite it starting off as a thriller told from the guilty's perspective as essence of chase looms in the background. Later on, following the famous shower scene, tides will turn and what essentially remains a detective story is told from a killer's perspective. The film places the audience within the world of a murderer and we begin to see that world through the eyes of this character, something that occurs perhaps slightly out of turn when Norman spies on Marion getting undressed in her motel room by the office. It is a signifying of power; a placing the audience into a position of power that they are forced to share with Norman, whom, at the time, probably just comes across as a little eccentric. Later on, however, the audience are completely roped in and must share the stress with Norman. A clever move on Hitchcock's behalf is in the form of private detective Milton Arbogast (Balsam), who badgers poor Norman at the motel reception about recent visitors. Norman squirms and, as an audience, we may have an immediate reaction of not wanting Norman to get caught out. But should we be feeling these emotions given who he is and what he did? If Psycho achieves anything, it is the manipulation of genre and film language, but it is additionally the breaking down of a character archetype. For the film to spend time with Norman, a seemingly normal human being, as this 'monster' inhabiting a horror film, is extraordinary. There is nothing initially uncanny about Norman and he is a far cry from previous horror genre 'monsters' in the form of anything Universal had to offer at the time. But the film retains a spooky and unnerving atmosphere, punctuated by set pieces involving the aforementioned Arbogast, in a memorable scene on some stairs; but also right towards the end when normal, everyday individuals move in on Bates' house to uncover the truth, in what is a sequence that is still rather frightening. Psycho is somewhat of a towering achievement, and the fact an individual produced this sort of a film yet still managed to cause debate as to whether it's his out-and-out best work, is arguably the most incredible thing about the Psycho.",Psycho
87,filipemanuelneto,An immortal milestone,10,10 July 2016,"This film revolves around a small roadside motel run by Norman Bates, a seemingly nice man who lives under the undisputed authority of his mother. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this film, considered by many his ""magnum opus"", has a screenplay by Joseph Stefano and a cast led by Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles.I don't consider this film a horror movie, although its considered as such by most of people. It doesn't scare me, but let me uncomfortable, holding me to the screen. And I think that's what Hitchcock wanted to achieve. He was the master of suspense and knew how to hold the public, causing shivers of discomfort without putting the audience screaming in fear. The plot is brilliant, but the beginning doesn't show it, is intentionally unattractive in an effort to bring the public completely at ease... until Norman comes in. Norman Bates is one of the most psychologically complex characters I've ever seen, and was developed to the extreme by the director and the artist who gave him life. It looks like a nice guy, who even flirts with the attractive woman he just met. The bathroom scene is perhaps one of the most famous in the film (I read somewhere that liquid chocolate was used to give the color that Hitchcock intended for the blood in the tub), and the incidental soundtrack used in that scene has become an icon for itself. But the end of the film is even better, with an absolutely staggering climax that makes all the audience feel that it was worth seeing the movie (even if you already know the whole story). The photograph, in black and white, makes a decisive contribution to increasing tension in the audience, and I am sure that this was a conscious and deliberate choice of Hitchcock to achieve that, showing again the great quality and talent of this director.Nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Art Direction in Film Black and White, Best Cinematography in Black and White, Best Direction and Best Supporting Actress, this film didn't win any of them, which shows us that, sometimes, the Academy also makes mistakes. But ""Psycho"" doesn't need an Oscar to be a tremendous success. It is, and will remain, a milestone in film history, a cult film for Hitchcock lovers, for thriller lovers and for any lover of good movies. Movies like this one never dies, they are art... in its purest form.",Psycho
88,Rectangular_businessman,Psycho,10,3 October 2010,"For my money, you just don't find a better performance of a character than Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins never totally got his due as an actor. The man was brilliant, and Norman was of course his greatest achievement.One of the interesting things about Psycho now is the not-so-publicized trouble the film had on initial release. Reviews were mixed, to say the least. One British reviewer (C. A. Lejuene) actually quit her job because the movie so offended her. But it was a massive hit with the public, and then critics literally changed their minds. Different world.That Bates became such an iconic film character is no surprise. Perkins makes that happen in every shot. Norman is about as creepy a character as you can find. Despite being a murderer, he's no killer. He's an extremely nervous, anti-social, near-shell of a man so mentally and morally corrupted and broken that it's hard to imagine him doing anything else with his life. He waits at his dingy motel for the rare occupant. Surely, he doesn't have much at all to do with most of them. It's the ones who want to talk to him that find trouble, as he's incapable of interacting peacefully.There is a shame to Norman. He is constantly embarrassed by his own perceived shortcomings, despite being a tall, good-looking man. Given that everyone and their mother has seen and discussed this film, we know the reason for his eternal agony with himself, but just in case someone stumbles upon this and has not seen Psycho or doesn't know the ending, I'll avoid going into it, because I'd hate to be the person who ruins this movie.I saw this movie first when I was eight years old. It thrilled me, and that is really the only time I've ever been truly and completely detached and sucked into a film's world. I am not saying this is the greatest film of all-time (it would be up there on my personal list, in part because of my attachment to it), but I was born 22 years after this movie was released. A lot changes culturally in 30 years, especially when the start of that was in 1960. Since I was just a kid and movies from 1960 weren't exactly lunch line talk, I didn't know anything at all about Psycho. It just happened to be on TV, and I fell in love with it. It was gripping, I probably had the sense that it was beyond me (or however you'd put that at eight), and Perkins' performance mesmerized me. I'd never seen anything like that. I started watching non-kids movies and TV a lot earlier than a lot of folks did, because supervision of TV was never a big thing for my family. It was just assumed that if I saw a bad guy kill a broad, I would have the common sense instilled in me to not go out and do that myself. But I'd never seen anything like Norman Bates.And really, I still haven't.This is a film people will still be watching in another 50 years. The revelations and twists have become less shocking as time has passed, because so many movies have gone down similar roads, but Psycho has its own tone and that performance from Perkins that keeps it elevated among the best.",Psycho

90,TheMovieDiorama,"Psycho not only shocked audiences, it defined the thriller genre.",9,27 February 2018,"I don't think there has ever been a film more referenced than Psycho. The musical score, the shower scene, the memorable characters...heck, it's even spawned a TV series. Essentially a young woman is responsible for cashing in $40,000 to her work's bank, but instead goes on the run. She stops by the Bates Motel for a rest, little did she know it would be her eternal resting place. An investigation arises into Norman Bates where certain ominous discoveries are made. This was completely unconventional back in 1960. To kill off the lead protagonist halfway through the film was bold. I'm talking massive kahunas. It was groundbreaking. Hitchcock had the audience right on his fingertips, like a puppeteer. His directing style was better than perfect. I've never seen such inventive camera techniques that clearly has influenced filmmakers today. The shower scene switching back and forth between the knife and Janet Leigh screaming, only to then watch the blood drain from the pristine bathtub. The slow panning as Vera Miles searches Bates' house, how every room concealed many secrets. Then the climax. The big reveal. Simply unforgettable. Hitchcock's natural talent of creating suspense and tension has yet to be exceeded. All performances were classy and felt natural. Leigh and Miles exhumed elegance. Balsam plays the private investigator with complete control. But Anthony Perkins...wow. His ability to switch from creepy psychopath to normal human was masterful. I couldn't take my offs of the screen. Finally that musical score evokes nightmares. Sharp, high pitched notes to keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film's entirety. Some of the thrills were inconsistent and the build up to these crescendos take slightly too long, but the characters are developed enough to prevent the build up from being boring. However, Psycho is an extremely well controlled thriller that not only defined the genre, but paved the way for the future of cinema. A must-see for any film buff.",Psycho

92,BaronBl00d,Very Deserved of Such High Praise,10,6 September 2001,"The story of the motel owner with a split personality is part of our American culture.  Everyone is familiar with the famous shower scene. Bernard Herrmann's score evokes memories and moods instantly.  Psycho is a film masterpiece.  It is a wonderfully chilly tale of sexual repression, of madness, of the effects that living alone can have on an individual, and finally on the rural aspects of horror in the life of rural America.  It is a cheaply made film, but accomplishes so much with so little.  The credit goes to a handful of people.  First and foremost in this group stands the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock.  It is Hitchcock's best film in terms of utilizing the minimal for the most shocking scenes ever filmed. His shower scene is forever etched into the mindset of people all over the world.  When the film came out, people were afraid to take showers afterward for quite awhile.  The camera lens sets the pace for the film, and my favourite scene is Janet Leigh driving in the car.  Extremely well-shot scenes with a steady current of tension.  Hitchcock was ably assisted by all concerned.  Herrmann's score is awesome.  Joseph Stefano did a wonderful job adapting the wonderful novel by horror legend Robert Bloch.  The acting is first-rate.  Anthony Perkins did such a good job that he never could escape the role of Norman Bates.  Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, even John Gavin do credible jobs.  Janet Leigh is very good, and looks quite fetching and provocative in a black brassiere.  Watch for cameos by Simon Oakland(from The Night Stalker fame) and Ted Knight as a guard.  An incredible film in many ways - not least of which is the incredible legacy the film has acheived in our cultural panorama.",Psycho

94,insomniac_rod,The perfect combination of everything = a masterpiece.,10,6 February 2006,"HUGE SPOILERSWhenever someone mentions ""Psycho"", the first thing that comes to mind is Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates. But ""Psycho"" is more than Perkins' extraordinary performance and Hitchcock's masterful direction. The movie offers a great plot of mystery and horror. It all starts as a dramatic situation but turns into a story of horror and beyond reason. Marion Crane escapes from his routine life and steals $40,000 from her work in order to start a new life with her boyfriend. Marion knows it's wrong but her moral won't stop her from doing her purpose. Everything seems to work on wheels until she stops in the Bates Motel where soon she will find her cruel fate. At this point of the movie you don't expect that it will be the main character's last scene!. This is where ""Psycho"" turns into a shocking movie, and at the same time the viewer is slapped in the face by Hitchcock's unique way of creating a suspenseful/creepy atmosphere. But it's until the audience meets Norman Bates (played masterfully by Mr. Anthony Perkins) when things start to get a new point of view. The story gets rid of the angelic heroine that turned bad and now focuses on the mysterious Motel's owner. Norman seems to be a shy guy with a dark vibe that makes his presence uncomfortable. His major problem is his over-protective mother than won't allow him to do anything that she considers is against moral. As Norman talks about his mother and how he's affected by her ""madness"", the viewer can determine that he is mentally disturbed but knows perfectly how to behave. Anthony Perkins acting is terrific because he knows how to create an uncomfortable atmosphere whenever he's on screen and mainly because he seems to be the kind of guy that is silent but dangerous at the same time. This is where the real suspense of the movie begins. And after Marion's murder things seem to get out of control for people who are used to scripts that don't get out of the standards. The main character is dead by half of the movie and from then, the situations become more interesting (in the point of view of a general audience) and you don't know what's gonna happen next, not even from a guess. This 180 degree twist has to be the most important in terms of contribution to any genre (being in this situation the Horror genre). What will happen to the people trying to find Marion? what about the $40,000? Who is behind Marion's murder? And most important of all, what's behind Norman Bates' behavior? Watch ""Psycho"" in order to witness one of the most important movies of all time. Even if you don't like the Horror/Mystery genre, this movie will leave you satisfied because it offers everything a good movie needs : Good acting, masterful direction, excellent script, and a perfect score.Anthony Perkins delivers a performance that needs special mention. The man knows how to portray a psycho like no other can. Thank you Mr. Perkins for the performance that most people respect in the genre. Janet Leigh also delivers a believable performance. She showed that she is a great actress. The death scenes are beyond great this time. You don't see coming Mother ! whenever she raises the knife! Excellent scenes. Always copied, never matched. Also, the score deserves a honorable mention. This is probably the best score in any Horror film! Followed by Carpenter's in ""Halloweeen"" maybe. Please, do yourself a favor and watch this movie in order to witness why this is the most influential movie of all time. The story is excellent and it's backed by solid acting and a wonderful direction by the master of all; Alfred Hitchcock.The shower scene is one of the most important scenes of all time, not to mention the shocking ending. This is truly a scary movie on it's own. No need of gore, f/x, or abuse of twist situations.",Psycho

96,Movie_Muse_Reviews,The mother of all horror films,9,16 June 2009,"Going into the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece ""Psycho,"" it's best that you know nothing -- in fact Hitchcock wanted it that way -- so this review will be devoid of any synopsis beyond that of the basic plot summaries given on IMDb. But truth is, the plot is only half the film's genius. The rest belongs to the master of murder and suspense.""Psycho"" thrives on suspense. Without the constant feeling of paranoia from Hitchcock's careful camera movements or from Bernard Herrmann's vigorous string quartet, many parts of the film would feel long. At this point in his career, Hitchcock was so commanding of his craft that he achieves the desired effect from his audience with nearly every shot, whether it's wanting us to focus on particular items or make specific assumptions about the mystery at hand.Perhaps the most understated element of the film is Joseph Stefano's screenplay. From what I gather about Robert Bloch's novel, Stefano restructured the story to set up a jarring shift in the plot and encase the mystery in an even thicker container for Hitchcock to best utilize his skills. The scripts only major weakness is the scene right after the climax, which is pointless exposition explaining the previous events; something movie watchers don't need today -- though that's arguably because Hitchcock made this movie.For those that love Hitchcock's style, ""Psycho"" is an instant classic and perhaps no film of his showcases it better. For those unfamiliar with his work, it's not hard to see while watching ""Psycho"" what made his films so memorable. Even those who don't have an eye for good film-making can even appreciate the entertaining suspense and constantly twisting plot of ""Psycho.""",Psycho

Anthony Perkins was perfect as the timid and charming but psychotic Norman Bates, and Hitchcock's direction molds Robert Bloch's novel into a timeless thriller that is as satisfying to someone seeing it for the first time as to someone who has seen in 50 times.
Even though I am a pretty serious film fanatic, I did not see Psycho for the first time until late 1998 - I actually saw the re-make first. I enjoyed that film, and decided to finally see the original to see what was so great about it. Psycho made a tremendous impact on me, and it was the only movie I have ever seen that I wanted to rewind and watch again as soon as it ended.

99,jzappa,The Persona of Horror Films,10,24 October 2011,"It wasn't a message about psychological abuse or the dark side of the maternal instinct that enthused the audiences, nor was it any particular performance. They were stimulated by sheer, out-and-out cinema. Hitchcock consciously shot Psycho not with his high-priced feature regulars but with his TV crew. Lengthy segments hold no dialogue. In its gut sensation, Psycho fits better alongside shoestring noir like Detour than with Hitchcock's own chic Technicolor thrillers like Rear Window or Vertigo. In this way and in its starring use of Janet Leigh, Psycho is as much a companion piece with Touch of Evil as it is Hitchcock's arguably most socially pivotal film.But no other Hitchcock film had more effect. He's directing us. It was the most staggering film 1960 moviegoers had ever experienced. You couldn't be today's pervasive moviegoer: Walking in late, you'd be waiting to see the star after she's disappeared from the action. Plus, the internet would've shattered any possibility of preserving the movie's genuine shocks, none of which one could've anticipated Hitchcock had in store without it. Modern moviegoers would've ruined this film for themselves before even walking in. He didn't just direct movies. He directed us. He directed several subsequent decades of movie plot expectations.Of course, today's generation can still see it as a fearsome, ingenious thriller despite knowing all about the shower scene that would've been like the revelation of Luke Skywalker's father in 1960 terms rather than 1980 ones. It's all owing to Hitchcock's imagination in two matters not as obvious: The pure subjective telling of Marion Crane's story, and her rapport with her new host. Hitchcock's trick is dedicating his thorough concentration and flair to handling them like they'll be expanded upon for the whole remaining film.Anthony Perkins is uncanny in establishing the thorny character of Norman, in a performance that has become momentous. He lets us know there's something deeply amiss with Norman, and yet he has a young man's congeniality, stuffing his hands into his pockets, hopping onto the porch, beaming a toothy greeting. Only when discussion becomes personal does he begin to hesitate and sidestep. He evokes our empathy right alongside Marion's.Nearly every present-day viewer is spending that whole time anticipating the spectacle of murder in store. However, seeing the shower scene today, various elements are notable. Unlike contemporary horror films, Psycho never sees the knife actually striking flesh. We see no wounds. Herrmann's slicing strings deputize for more gruesome sounds. And yet this remains the most famously shocking of cinema's slasher deaths, suggesting that graphic details are more shocking in our mind's eye and ear depending on their circumstances and creativity.The terror of the rug being yanked swiftly and completely from beneath us is followed by Norman's painstaking erasure of the whole staggering affair. Hitchcock is subtly swapping protagonists. The new one killed the old one, yes, but we relate to Norman because, if we killed somebody, we'd be devoured by paranoia and remorse, just like him. The car sinks, then lingers. Norman watches fixedly, until it's ultimately submerged beneath the swamp.Checking one's feelings, it dawns that we want that car to sink, which is what Norman wants. This is one of the most daring exchanges in Hitchcock's sustained custom of stage-managing the audience itself. Psycho's legend and luster will never die because, when innumerable films are over and done as the credits roll, it ties as candidly with our apprehensions as movie-making form can: That any one of us may impetuously commit a crime, our dread and paranoia of the police, our nightmares of becoming the quarry of a madman, and naturally, of failing our mothers.",Psycho

Still one of the most beloved thrillers ever made and an all-around classic. The shower scene movie.And yet, if that's all you know the movie from, you're missing a lot. The shower scene was scandalous back in its day, much like the rest of the film in general, but it doesn't encapsulate the film all that well. It happens near the middle of the film and a lot happens after it. Sure, it is the most striking scene in the film, but I would personally put more weight on the overall performances of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh as Marion Crane.With these two powerful actors Hitchcock manages to tell a truly haunting and nerve-wracking story. Because, to be honest, nowadays the movie would be a bit boring and a lot predictable. The viewer is never truly confused as to where the film is going. But in a way that even enhances the experience. Because you can so clearly see why these characters would make these decisions given the amount of information they have.Add in some masterful camerawork, some really insightful use of surroundings and shadows, the two main actors and a one of the creepiest scores ever produced, and you have a masterful film in your hands.A must see film for all fans of horror and still a really, really good experience all around, despite its age.",Psycho
101,gwnightscream,"""Mother Knows Best!""",8,29 March 2013,"Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and John Gavin star in Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 thriller based on the novel. This begins one afternoon in Phoenix, Arizona where we meet woman, Marion Crane (Leigh) and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (Gavin). Marion is a bank teller who decides to take a great sum of money from a very important client & friend of her boss in order to help Sam pay his debts. She runs away and drives until she checks into an isolated motel owned by mild-mannered young man, Norman Bates (Perkins) who lives with his ill mother. After Norman confides in Marion, she's brutally murdered in her motel room. Miles plays her sister, Lila who eventually meets Sam and together they learn what she's done and try to find her. The answers lie in wait when they go to the Bates motel and discover the truth about Norman and his mother. This classic forever changed the way we take showers and has inspired many slasher films such as John Carpenter's ""Halloween"" where the kitchen knife, the name, Sam Loomis and Leigh's daughter, Jamie Lee Curtis were used to pay homage. It's definitely Hitchcock's signature film featuring a good cast & excellent score by Bernard Herrmann. I recommend this.",Psycho
102,GOWBTW,This is one of Hitchcock's very best films!,10,19 July 2005,"Who would dare to put Janet Leigh in the shower and let ""Mother"" stab her many times? HITCHCOCK! Who would show Janet Leigh in bra and half-slip? HITCHCOCK! Who is the master of mystery and mayhem? HITCHCOCK! Yes, it's macabre master himself, Alfred Joseph Hitchcock, British film maker who makes a film for the American audience. This man is not afraid, he is bold, brainy, and very well rounded in his work. And this movie is in my opinion, one of the best he's ever made. Janet Leigh(1927-2004) did an outstanding job playing the thieving Marion Crane. The question does puzzles me in the beginning of the film is why was she wearing white bra and half-slip? Very kinky to start, but very interesting as well. Women like that don't wear white, supposed a downpour would occur and she wore black underneath, it would be quite embarrassing. Or is it? Other than that, she does drive over to the Bates Motel where it's run by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins,1932-92), may look sensitive, but BEWARE! He always have to listen to Mother. I say Norman needs to avoid Mother, she's a real bad influence! Bates is also a voyeur, he happens to watch Marion undress. Naughty, naughty! For a man who kills women. After he kills Marion which is most likely the most infamous scene, he would try his best for her sister, which is stopped by Sam Loomis(John Gavin). I wonder if Perkins was in to transvestitism to get the role at that time? Hmmmm! Well anyway, this is one of the few hits in the 60's that can be enjoyed for horror fans of every generation. Still for person 17 and over! All I have to say is, WATCH OUT! YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET STABBED! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Rating 5 stars!",Psycho
103,FiendishDramaturgy,Much More a Psychological Thriller Than A Horror,9,28 December 2008,"This is considered, and rightfully so, the grandfather of all slashers. It IS that. Period. Nothing I say hereafter is designed to lessen that fact.Psycho is a study of the higher end of the schizophrenic mind, when coupled with some of the more extreme examples of the Oedipus complex. In this example, Norman BECOMES his deceased mother; a mother he killed for bringing confliction and sexual repression into his psyche. Her addition of a new boyfriend into the already sexually muddled situation, added just enough aggression to the mix that it culminated in the murder of both the mother AND the boyfriend, leaving Norman to figure out his own place in the world.Once Norman decided that his mother was still alive and still instructing him in how to behave in life, dictating his actions, and deciding his fate by committing heinous acts of her own, Norman then adapted himself to fit his mother's teachings and instructions. He thereby molded himself into a serial killer who not only could, but required, the close intimate act of knife work, as that was the only intimacy he was allowed.And then once he killed, the confliction sets in. Everything is meticulously cleaned up, intimately inventoried, and utterly hidden. The crime scene is lovingly restored to its virginal state, and Normal resumes his otherwise lackluster life.As a movie, this is a masterpiece no matter what others would say. The pure psychology of the antagonist is case and study for countless students over the nearly fifty years since this hit the big screen. Hitchcock demonstrates a total understanding of the psychopathic mind, and translates that understanding brilliantly to the silver screen.His choice of Bosco (chocolate syrup) to serve as the blood in the shower scene shows a deeper understanding of the necessary visual dynamics required to propel this into the annals of ""classic,"" regardless of what some naysayers would opine. Psycho IS a classic. It is a classic among Hitchcock's works, among the horror genre, the psychological thriller genre, and among the slasher sub-genre.No matter how old this is, it still generates a lovely suspense, and stands tall when compared to modern films of the same genre(s).All in all, this is a great watch, even for a Friday or Saturday night.It rates a 9.4/10 from...the Fiend :.",Psycho
104,Captain_Couth,Alfred Hitchcock Classics: Psycho.,9,9 October 2004,"Psycho (1960) is one of my favorite Hitchcock films. The movie is loosely based upon the novel by Robert Bloch and it was adapted by Joseph Stefano. Psycho made stars out of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins (sadly it also sent the two to typecasting hell in the process). Hitchcock proved that he could adapt to the changing styles of Hollywood and make a true horror classic. He wisely shot the movie in black and white (giving the film an even creepier aura)and used a lot of great camera angles and trick photography. Anthony Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, a young man who's life has been ruined by his overbearing mother. Janet Leigh is perfect as the young woman with the shady past trying to find a new life.Psycho was not only the pinnacle in Alfred Hitchcock's film career as a director but it also changed the face of horror. Just when film makers such as himself where being phased out by Hollywood, Mr. Hitchcock redefined not only as a director but in the process changed the face of horror forever.The success of this movie spawned three direct sequels, a pilot for a t.v. series (Bates Motel) and a badly made remake (Although I have to say the cinematography was beautiful). It has also been parodied to death and referenced in many horror films and comedies. Psycho has not only achieved worldwide fame but it's also a part of Americana as well. I recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it already. Truly a one of a kind film.Highest recommendation possible.",Psycho
105,bsmith5552,12 Rooms...12 Vacancies!,10,7 May 2020,"""Psycho"", in my humble opinion, is the best of Director Alfred Hitchcock's films. It has everything that you would want in a thriller love making, theft, fear, murder tension and unexpected twists. It's divided into three parts, the theft of the $40K, the aftermath of the first murder and the solution of the crime.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary to a real estate agent George Lowry (Vaughn Taylor). Marion has been meeting boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) for some ""afternoon delight"". They are unable to marry due to Loomis large alimony payments. Lowry has been selling a home to Tom Cassidy (Frank Albertson) and the two have been out celebrating the sale. Cassidy insists on paying the $40K sale price in cash and brings the money to the office.Marion is asked to take the cash to the bank, She asks for the rst of the day off and decides to yield to temptation and flees with the money. She heads for the California town of Fairview (I think) the home of Loomis and his hardware store. On the way Marion pulls over to the side of the road to rest.The next morning a Highway Patrol Officer (Mort Mills) in sinister reflective sun glasses questions her. He becomes suspicious of her nervousness. In the next town, Marion pulls into a used car lot and trades her car in. The salesman Charlie (John Anderson) is curious as to why she is in such a hurry. The Highway Patrolman pulls up opposite the car lot and unnerves Marion.Marion proceeds on her way and gets caught up in a rain storm. Only miles away from her destination, she pulls off the road into an out of the way motel...""The Bates Motel"" There she is greeted by a personable Norman Bates who checks her into her room. Norman offers to make a snack for Marion. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother. When Norman returns, Marion tries to talk the momma's boy Norman into leaving the abusive old lady. He refuses. However in telling each other their troubles, Marion sees the error of her theft and plans to return the money the next day.Marion with a clear conscience, decides to take a relaxing shower when a shadowy figure creeps into the bathroom and unexpectedly murders her. Norman back at the house on the hill, sees blood on his mother mnad rushes to Marion's room. He is shocked at what he finds but decides to protect his mother nad cleans up the crime scene. He places Marion's body in her car and sinks it in a bog behind the motel.A week later, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) arrives at Sam's store trailed by private investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam). They both are concerned over Marion's disappearance and feel that she is hiding somewhere in town. They soon realize that something more serious has occurred. They go to local sheriff Al Chambers (John McIntyre) for help. They explain the situation. He informs them that Norman's mother has evidently been dead these past ten years.Arbogast, hired by Lowry, checks all the local hotels for a trace of Marion and ultimately arrives at the Bates Motel. He becomes suspicious of the nervous Norman and decides that he will try to interview Norman's mother. As he goes up the staircase in the house he receives a big surprise.When Arbogast fails to return, Lila and Sam decide to visit the Bates Motel themselves. They immediately become suspicious. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house in search of Mrs. Bates. Norman overpowers Sam and races to his mother's aid. Lila is searching the creepy old house and descends into the basement when Norman returns. What she finds is the answer to Norman's secret.I envy anyone seeing ""Psycho"" for the first time and experiencing the shocks provided by Mr. Hitchcock for the first time. I mean, how in how many films is the leading lady murdered early in the story?The performances are universally great with Perkins standing out. Leigh and Miles give strong feminine interpretations to their roles. The film is populated with top character actors of the day. In addition to those already mentioned, we have Simon Oakland as the psychiatrist who explains all, Lurene Tuttle as Mrs. Chambers and Pat Hitchcock as Marion's co-worker. And watch for Alfred Hitchcock's cameo at the beginning of the movie.And the score by Bernard Hermann............WOW! It's just like another character in the movie.Followed by two sequels and a TV movie over twenty years later.",Psycho
106,elshikh4,Clinging to The Past !,8,21 December 2008,"I think that's an important horror piece. Bold, and nasty. But being just the well-done even original horror, doesn't make it outlive all the other movies of the genre as sure it did. What I loved about Psycho, regarding that I don't ""love"" the Horror genre in the first place!, else being a brilliant case of Jekyll and Hyde as son and mother, or being that awesomely suspenseful and highly creepy, is that it has unique interpretation, and talented inner meaning of its own that will give it the immortality it deserves. In short, this genre movie.. Got brains!Norman Bates is nothing but a rare perfect type of a person who lives the past, and can't let it go. He is a clear proof that the strong clinging to the past, with losing the contact with the present, makes you a monster indeed. Look at him, lost it after the murder of his mother, the time stopped in that sick point, and also him. So when he couldn't utterly face the truth, the reality, he had to continue living yesterday endlessly and dopily, which led him to be the freak he was. He managed to kill his days by killing his best dreams / the nice girls, because he was a slave of his fear to face the world with his desires, transforming into the most ravenous, as well as the most alive, stuffed animal in the house.Norman buried his mother so himself into this motel where only his demons were being comfortable. This old palace illustrated perpetually the dark bygone, or the importunate sins, when we don't have the ability to break it away to become our chosen big tomb, and our dreams' slaughterhouse. Strange that nobody ever helped Norman, but since when anybody ever thinks of a troubled person like him in a greedy world that runs after the money, and the money only. Actually, it could be the reason why Norman Bates pulled off murdering whoever came to the motel, as he was stronger than them all, since he doesn't want the money.I liked the idea of suppressed kid in Anthony Perkins's performance as Norman, and how that could make him a serial killer in a way. The dialogue was plain and deep if you catch on the film's main motif, and interesting also with its sarcastic indications at the second watching: ""Mother didn't feel like herself tonight!"". And (Bernard Herrmann) is the best when it comes to create great horror music; I read once about making his music for black and white films into black and white feel too, by his own special orchestration. This man got both the eloquent style and the commercial captivity superbly. I'm obsessed with the opening credits' hot score, it said it all, and it can infiltrate into your deepest nastiness, or deal with what's under your skin of the most awful thoughts ever.I adore the brief, yet marvelously clever, zoom-in on Norman's face after he drowned the car, aside from being darkly expressing and distinctive at the 1950s' end, it's a slight touch confirms how Hitch was madly in love with the art of cinema. Though, still the most terrifying moment was when we have the chance finally to meet Mrs. Bates' face, but as for now, it's definitely the moment after, when Norman as Mrs. Bates smiles at the camera's eye refusing to harm a fly, and in one split second, we saw the ghost of the real mother's empty skull while the mix of the lifted car / the film's last shot; I believe Hitchcock made it confident that someone would see it as well as relish it in the assured next watching. As you see, one watching isn't enough.For negative points; unlike millions, I hated the bathtub's crime scene; yes, it was new, frightful, and Hitch enjoyed handling it cinematically, but it took sex and violence to extremes on screen, representing a new age of exploiting these factors in a shocking manner. A manner that would pave the way for more shocking, less human horror movies. I know that it's art, and the artist is free, and their creations have to develop, and push the boundaries, but maybe I don't like this kind of development, or encourage pushing these very boundaries.Btw, he lost reason behind the rest of Psycho's franchise as being lower is easy, they were only the exploitation, as cheap horror movies, with nothing under the surface to present, let alone the matter of breakable surface already, with less artistic everything, as if the producers took the worst of Norman Bates and Marion Crane themselves; killing madly yet to earn some big bucks!Psycho is some climax for Hitchcock, in terms of ability and popularity. It's a fine genre movie with possible meaning, which means very fine in my book apart. And the best about it was that it achieved being the most *film* among all the genre's movies.",Psycho

108,freemantle_uk,Classic Hitchcock,9,14 October 2012,"Psycho is widely regarded as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and one of the first slasher films ever made.In Phoenix, Arizona, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary who steals with $40,000 from one of her bosses clients. Marion flees the city and goes on a trip where sees ends up staying at the Bates Motel, meeting the owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who has a very unusual relationship with his mother.Hitchcock is of course the master of suspense and throughout Psycho there is a very intense atmosphere throughout the film. There is constant tension and build up during the film with Hitchcock using long takes and conversations, dark shots and imaginary and that very famous film score. Whilst the film is a horror and slasher, Hitchcock allows us to know the characters and he plays to his strength as a thriller director, particular in the second half. This is not a film about violence and killings like a lot of modern slashers are. It is a film particularly at the time that aimed to shock you with the violence, not for you to linger or relish it.There is an excellent cast in the film and it is clear why the role of Norman Bates was so iconic for Perkins. Perkins gave Bates a nervous energy with his seemingly shy, nice demeanour which secretly harbours a dark personality and secret. The last shot of the film makes Perkins look very much like Heath Ledger's version of the Joker with his creepy smile.Psycho was a risky film for the time: bloody on screen violence was rarity, even when it saved a narrative purpose and the woman who is the main character gets killed off at around 50 minute mark. This is a story technique that is still rarity used and most films still stick to a traditional narrative. Because of the killing Hitchcock changes the style of film from a horror to thriller/mystery and Hitchcock is able to blend them together perfectly.Psycho is of course a classic film and great example that tension and likable/relatable characters are key for a horror film to success. The visions, performances, atmosphere and music were all fitting for the film.",Psycho

110,ackstasis,"""She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.""",10,16 May 2008,"June, 1960. The movie theatre is quiet; 45 minutes ago, the halls were buzzing with anticipation, but not anymore. Nobody has been allowed into the cinema since the picture began, and the audience is dead quiet. Through the walls of the theatre, one can hear the muffled whirr of running water. Silence. An indistinct shadow is seen approaching through the curtain. Accompanied by the fierce screech of violins, hundreds of voices suddenly utter a deafening chorus of horrified shock; some patrons collapse into the aisle. Bernard Hermann continues to pound the violin with extraordinary intensity, and a bloody streak carves its path towards the drainpipe. Audience members reel with a frantic mixture of stunned confusion and gripping fear. The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, has just painted the most extraordinary masterstroke of his distinguished career. The simple act of taking a shower will never again be the same.Though he produced many films that could justifiably be considered masterpieces, it is unlikely that Hitchcock ever directed anything more popular and influential than 'Psycho (1960).' The first of only two Hitchcock horror films, it shocked many with its unique narrative structure, and the infamous ""shower scene"" has become permanently imprinted in the movie-going public's collective memory. Hitchcock allegedly produced the film in order to reclaim his designation as ""The Master of Suspense,"" as he considered Frenchman Henri-Georges Clouzot to have temporarily seized the title with 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and especially 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' Interestingly, the latter film has a particularly alarming bathtub sequence, and perhaps 'Psycho' was the film through which Hitchcock was able to respond to (and improve upon) the achievements of his chief rival. Gone are the larger-than-life artistic flourishes of 'Vertigo (1958)' and 'North by Northwest (1959)'  this is the Master of Suspense at his leanest and meanest, a film completely stripped of its spectacle and lowered into the unfathomable depths of the disturbed human mind.Adapted by Joseph Stefano and Samuel A. Taylor from a 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' opens with the character of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real-estate secretary who impulsively steals $40,000 from her boss and flees in the direction of her California boyfriend. Her cross-country flight ultimately leads her to the Bates Motel, managed by the awkward and mild-mannered Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a man who submits loyally to the wishes of his mentally-ill, domineering mother. Meanwhile, Marion's boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) and sister Lila (Vera Miles) set out in pursuit, their search ending  inevitably  at the Bates motel. The story sporadically shifts from one character to the other; after convincing audiences that Marion Crane is ""the wrong man"" of so many of his previous pictures, Hitchcock deftly strikes at the heart of their sympathies. In his early film 'Sabotage (1936),' the director had condemned his own decision to murder a character with whom the viewer had been asked to identify, though here he once again dared to break his own rules, and we've never forgotten it.Paramount was so aghast at the story's graphic subject matter, labelling it ""too repulsive,"" that Hitchcock's budget was severely restricted, and the director was forced to finance the film through his own Shamley Productions. These budget limitations proved crucial in developing the unforgettable atmosphere, and were a major factor in his decision to film is black-and-white (which he also did to avoid incurring the wrath of the censors). Though 'Psycho' received a mixed critical response upon its release, its commercial success was extraordinary, and film-goers lined entire city blocks to experience the director's latest. Conversely, fellow British director Michael Powell's thematically-similar 'Peeping Tom (1960)' had been severely trashed by critics and audiences alike just months earlier, and the career of the beloved filmmaker was, for all practical purposes, left in ruins. Furthermore, the success of 'Psycho' triggered the emergence of the ""slasher"" flick, and subsequent years saw a slew of inferior, gory and imaginatively-titled knock-offs, such as 'Maniac (1963),' 'Paranoic (1963)' and 'Fanatic (1965).'Though discussions of 'Psycho' rarely stray from the film's more disturbing moments, it's interesting to consider the various crucial scenes of human interaction. Marion's supper with Norman in the parlour room, surrounded by the seemingly-passive but strangely-threatening stuffed birds, is a masterpiece of nervous tension, awkwardness, and the tiny inflections of human speech that communicate more than mere words ever could. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman Bates to quirky perfection, and his character {perhaps modelled from Dennis Weaver's jittery hotel night manager in 'Touch of Evil (1958)'  also starring Janet Leigh} is a man who initially demands our pity and understanding. Even after the atrocity in the shower, Hitchcock, as he also did in 'Frenzy (1972),' builds a suspense sequence around a villain's attempts to conceal the traces of his crime. Martin Balsam is rarely mentioned when discussing the film, but his characterisation of detective Milton Arbogast is letter-perfect, his shrewd but amenable tone successfully lulling Norman into a false sense of triumph, and yet the audience knows full well that the experienced investigator sees the transparency of his lies.Despite the prevalence of cultural spoofs and references, 'Psycho' is a thriller that still holds up exceptionally well, even though most viewers are fully-aware of the first major twist. When I first watched the film several years ago, I was completely ignorant of Mother's true identity, and I gasped aloud at the revelation in the fruit cellar, the swinging lightbulb casting a shifting luminance on the rotting corpse of Norma Bates, as Bernard Herrmann's intense, imaginative and very memorable musical score screeches in the background. Few moments in cinema have succeeded in giving me the same icy chill as the image of Norman in the prison cell, consumed by the mental consciousness of his overbearing mother, and that sinister smile that fades subliminally into the decaying shadow of a human skull. Norman Bates will continue to live on in my nightmares.",Psycho
111,dee.reid,I guess it's never too late to thrown in your own love and admiration for a classic film...,10,27 June 2009,"I have to admit that I have a terrible habit of getting around to watching classic movies when it's really late in the game. I guess my excuse is that I'm only 23, and most of the so-called ""classic"" movies of the 20th century were made well before I was even born. I'm ashamed to say that I fell in love with both ""Jaws"" (1975) and ""Halloween"" (1978) just last year; this year, just about a half-hour ago, I had the great pleasure to see Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense-thriller ""Psycho.""A lot has already been said about this film, so I won't comment too much on what it's actually about, and instead I'll only comment on significance and my reactions to it. ""Psycho"" has a plot based heavily in reality: adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, the book and film were loosely based on the crimes of real-life Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. ""Psycho"" finds its story revolving around Marion Crane (the late Janet Leigh), a lowly Phoenix, Arizona, secretary who embezzles $40,000 from her boss and hits the road, later stopping in at the isolated Bates Motel, and meets the owner and sole employee of the establishment, Norman Bates (the late Anthony Perkins).The rest of the plot is well-known to anyone who has seen the film, so I won't describe it. Plus, to really describe the rest of the plot in any sort of detail at all will ruin the shocks and surprises that the film has in store for the viewer (most notoriously, the infamous ""shower scene,"" which has to be seen to be believed, and experienced). The ""shower scene"" itself is one of the chief reasons to see this picture; it's shocking, Bernard Herrmann's theme slices away at your eardrums, and it's one of the iconic death scenes - one of the most iconic scenes, period - in movie history.""Psycho"" is a phenomenal piece of film, from a master filmmaker and an equally talented cast and crew; it's a true cinematic landmark. Most importantly, and the reason why I now hold this film to the high degree that I do now, is that ""Psycho"" is partially (or is it entirely?) responsible for influencing entire generations of filmmakers, particularly those in the horror genre. ""Psycho"" has almost single-handedly influenced, and given rise to, the slasher sub-genre of horror, which of course gave rise to, and is populated by the likes of, Leatherface (from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" series), Michael Myers (from the ""Halloween"" series), Jason Voorhees (from the ""Friday the 13th"" series), my personal favorite movie slasher Fred Krueger (from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series), and countless other imitators. ""Psycho"" would itself become fodder for the slasher genre nearly two decades after its release, when it was followed up by three vastly inferior sequels, with Anthony Perkins reprising his signature role as Norman Bates in all three films.""Psycho"" has also been the subject of a lot of psychiatric and psychological analysis, for those interested in understanding the criminal mind and how it functions. As a criminal justice major in college, in my studies I've across several opportunities to study ""Psycho"" (but never did) and exactly how it influenced the slasher genre and why it's fascinated criminology experts in the decades since its release, thus having even greater influence outside of the film community and American pop culture.Alfred Hitchcock proved that he was a cinematic genius with ""Psycho,"" since I understand that it is arguably his best and most popular film. At least now I've finally had a chance to see a movie that I've heard so much about and never previously got the chance to watch.10/10",Psycho

This all time classic focuses on a devious woman trying to get away with stealing money and making a quick getaway when she decides to stay at the wrong hotel one inauspicious evening. This movie is directed by legend Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo and North by Northwest) and stars Vera Miles (The Wrong Man), Anthony Perkins (Murder on the Orient Express), John Gavin (Spartacus) and Janet Leigh (The Fog). I still love this movie. There's so much to enjoy. The soundtrack and effects in every sequence are so appropriate (though I keep hearing Busta Rymes when it plays). The acting and dialogue between characters is so good, especially the opening marriage conversation that shows how conflicted the main character is. I also loved the car trade in sequence to show how driven the main character was. The mother's voice is awesome, though how you could hear it outside the house, through the rain and into the hotel was baffling but let's not worry about that. The kill scene in the shower as well as the mother killing the detective was all time great, which goes without saying. Also loved the closing psychological evaluation and mother's closing conversation, ""she wouldn't even harm a fly."" It goes without saying this a too well written, executed and delivered to not be a 10/10.",Psycho
116,FilmCriticLalitRao,Strictly for all the psychos based all over the world,1,1 August 2007,"After having heard all the noise surrounding this film,I decided to watch this film as I had to give a presentation of a Stephen Rebello's book based on this film for my teacher Monsieur François Thomas at Cinema studies section of the University of Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle. I was utterly disappointed as this film was not so chilling as I had expected it to be.Psycho is more of a character study of some oddball persons.In the beginning Hitchcock takes us on a guilt trip of a woman who is in love with a married man.Funny thing is that both of them know that they cannot find any happiness in their so called secret love.Later on we are taken for a ride as this bizarre woman steals a lot of money and without any rhyme nor reason decided to leave her hometown.Now everybody knows what happens after that.Psycho is a film about matter of taste.

117,drqshadow-reviews,"A Stylish, Efficient Thriller; One of Hitchcock's Very Best",9,28 May 2020,"Bad luck for a bored bombshell, who opportunistically pockets a large sum of money, skips town and unwittingly pauses at a mass-murderer's motel to lay low. To say more would be a disservice to the uninitiated, even if the major points have already been spoiled by way of cultural osmosis. Sixty years is a long time to keep a secret, especially when all the most important scenes have been so frequently mirrored.Compelled to operate on an extremely low budget (studio brass had major doubts about the premise), in Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock leans heavily on his finely-honed directorial senses - artistry and atmosphere, primarily - in lieu of a dazzling set or gaudy wardrobe. The end result is a very moody, up-close and personal piece, entirely appropriate for such a character-driven tragedy. Subtext is the rule of the day, whether it's foreshadowing the awful events to come or nervously reveling in their aftermath.Much is said outside of the dialogue, in other words, and in such visually compelling ways! The guiding hand of frequent collaborator (and graphic design legend) Saul Bass is apparent in more than just the dynamic opening credits. Bass may not have actively directed the famous shower episode, as is often rumored, but his tight storyboards and Bernard Herrmann's indispensable musical cues essentially make the scene. Not to downplay Hitchcock's involvement, either; it takes a special brand of mastermind to assemble and curate such talent, to piece it all together in just the right order to achieve maximum dramatic effect.",Psycho
118,robfollower,Psycho(1960),10,9 August 2021,"Timeless Chills
The concept, based on the 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, is elemental. A woman flees a bad decision, and lands in the lair of a predator who is falling deep into his own psychosis. By the time he made PSYCHO, Hitchcock had directed dozens of films. He was acknowledged as the Master of Suspense, with the capital letters in that honorary title always implied in conversation. Hitchcock knew exactly how to construct a scene to evoke and exploit specific feelings. His style on PSYCHO was brisk and economical, and could be exceptionally brutal.Nowhere is that more apparent than in the murder of Marian Crane, played by the film's lone marquee movie star, Janet Leigh. No one going into PSYCHO expected Leigh's character to be killed off halfway through the movie, much less for it to happen in a dramatic and shattering sequence. The screeching strings and deep notes of the score by composer Bernard Herman turned the shower scene into a grueling horror showcase and sealed the movie's first major murder as a cinematic all-timer. The scene is created with such great skill that it has power even today, even after being endlessly homaged, parodied, replicated and ripped off. The shower scene lasts all of three minutes, but that 180 seconds echoes through decades of cinema.All Stripped Down
PSYCHO is entrenched as part of movie culture now, but its future was far from certain in 1960. Maybe you think of PSYCHO as an ""old movie"" (it is!), which makes its black and white aesthetic seem entirely appropriate. At the time, however, color was the norm for movies, especially for big pictures like those made by Alfred Hitchcock. His last movie before PSYCHO was NORTH BY NORTHWEST, a splashy caper starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. A hard-edged black and white thriller was an abrupt deviation from expectations.Paramount didn't want to make PSYCHO, so Hitchcock paid for it himself and produced it on the cheap. That meant using his ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"" production crew. Another money saving measure was the use of black and white film. All in all, PSYCHO cost under a million bucks; it was a fast, no-frills affair.A useful side benefit of shooting in black and white was that it helped hide some of the movie's gore. In 1960, Hollywood studios were still loosely bound by the fast-withering constraints of the production code. For decades, the production code had specified content seen as inappropriate for Hollywood movies. Explicit sex and violence were forbidden, and even implied content was strictly controlled. But the production code was on the way to obsolescence, and PSYCHO - which became a hit in part because of its shocking content - helped usher it out the door. No one had ever seen a movie like PSYCHO from Alford Hitchcock, or from any other major filmmaker working with an American studio.No Spoilers... or Else!Movie audiences now are averse to spoilers in a way that is fairly different from the norm in 1960, when it wasn't uncommon for ticket-buyers to walk into a movie at any point during the running time, then sit through a program of a feature or two and multiple shorts. Hitchcock's well-documented flair for publicity, combined with exceptional word-of-mouth, helped turn PSYCHO into a bona fide hit.As specified by the director, PSYCHO was promoted with a forbidding warning: No one would be admitted to the theatre after the movie began. Rather than turning audiences off from the movie, that stipulation created interest, and lines, and an ever-expanding audience.A Horrific Legacy
PSYCHO led to sequels (two of which are surprisingly good), an eyebrow-raising shot-for-shot remake by Gus Van Sant (which is an oddly compelling experiment) and a five-season television prequel series, ""Bates Motel."" Those are just the direct descendents of the movie; the entire slasher genre owes a debt to Hitchcock, just as horror movies in general enjoy a popularity that might not be quite the same without this benchmark-setting shocker.",Psycho
119,GiraffeDoor,it's good apart from the middle.,6,21 March 2019,What people don't tell you about this movie is how much it sags in the middle.I don't want to spoil anything but I think you can guess what happens early on that might do that.I was very intrigued as this movie started. I was curious to see what became of these characters. Then we meet Norman Bates and he is exactly what we want to see in these kinds of movies. He conveys an unintentionally disquieting character. You really feel like you are dealing with a damaged character but one who doesn't wear it on their sleeve like other characters would.There's the iconic scene which is stunning of course but then it drags because there's nothing to do except follow police procedure. That is the laziest kind of story: just follow people whose job it is to investigate macabre things...But it does pull itself together by the end. The ending will really stay with you. It's just thoughtful.,Psycho
120,estebangonzalez10,The master of all suspense thrillers,10,23 July 2012,"¨I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing.¨ Psycho is the master of all suspense thrillers and I will include it in my list of masterpieces. It was way ahead of its time and continues to impress today. This is where the term Hitchcockian came from to describe these psychological horror films that have been inspired by the great Hitchcock. It's been over 50 years since Hitchcock directed this film, and horror directors are still trying to imitate what he did. One of the things I enjoyed the most about this film is the way that Hitch fooled us all into thinking that it was going to be about Janet Leigh's character and ended up killing her off in the first half of the movie. I hadn't seen this film before, but had seen the famous shower scene thousands of times before. It's amongst the greatest scenes in film history considering the way Hitch filmed every shot taking the audience by surprise. I always thought that scene was the final one, so I was surprised to see it only 40 minutes into the movie. From that moment on I was sold and on board with what other unexpected turn the movie was going to make. Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates was the highlight of the movie for me. He was excellent in his role and I was surprised he didn't get much credit for it. I think he was much better than the rest of the cast. I also imagine what a surprise the ending must have been for most people during the time since it was something totally unprecedented. I did see it coming now of course since so many films have copied the format, but I can only imagine the initial reaction. Psycho was also the perfect title for the film.As for the story goes it deals with an office worker from a small town in Arizona named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is in her early 30's and single. She has to meet with her love interest, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), in secret during lunch hours in a motel because he is from out of town and buried in debts due to alimony payments. When she arrives at work from her break she stumbles upon 40,000 dollars that her boss hands over to her to deposit in the bank. During a moment of irrationality she decides to keep the money and begin a new life in some other town. She takes off as soon as she can and begins driving away from the city as fast as possible. Tired after the long drive, Marion ends up staying at a motel off the highway for the night. The motel is run by a friendly young man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who tells Marion that they don't get many visitors nowadays. He offers her something to eat before she goes to bed, and she accepts. She later hears Norman discussing with his mother about his invitation and discovers that he is dominated by her. Her strong influence over him worries Marion, but she is tired and just once to rest before continuing her trip. Norman may not be the friendly young man who he seems to be after we see him watch her from a peeping hole. What follows is the famous shower scene and then the story continues with several twists and surprises.I've heard many complaints about the final scene of this great film which was adapted by Joseph Stefano, from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name. I can understand how this scene may seem out of place, especially now because the audience is expected to piece everything on their own, but I consider it necessary for the time because audiences weren't familiar with the psychotic term or connotation. Of course the explanation seems out of place today because we all understand what has happened, but in the 60's this film was way ahead of its time and had no precedents so it was necessary to spell everything out to the audience. I may be wrong, but I still don't have a problem with that scene although I do admit it is one of the only scenes in the film that hasn't aged well. Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors and I wish more directors would make psychological thrillers as well as he did. Psycho is probably one of his most recognized works, but I still think his best movie all time is Rear Window. If you haven't seen these movies by all means go watch them because they are timeless.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",Psycho

122,pixrox1,PSYCHO is nearly a perfect movie . . .,10,6 August 2013,". . . until you get to the very end, where Hitchcock himself overruled his better judgment to ""humor"" screenwriter Joseph Stefano (according to Stefano, in Universal's 1999 ""Making of"" mini-documentary) and inflicted an endless 10 minutes of psychobabble upon an audience now more in danger of being bored to death than dying of fright. One can only surmise that Hitch viewed this seeming rare misstep as a ""necessary evil,"" feeling that those members of his 1960 initial release theater audiences who were born before the ""Roaring Twenties"" would be literally at risk of death if he did not include a hum-drum ""cooling off period"" toward the end, before they'd have to get up on their feet and leave. The crying shame is that all of this now hopelessly dated and quaint THREE FACES OF EVE crud could not have been trimmed to a minute or so in a subsequent director's cut. To hear Joe Stefano tell it, Hitch could not get enough of Joe's reports on Joe's on-going psychoanalysis (which I take for a lack of perception of ""being humored"" on Joe's part). However, this drawn out CLOSING of endless exposition is a cinematic no-no more worthy of Miss Marple than Hitchcock, and tacked on here to PSYCHO it is the equivalent of painting a Hitler mustache on Da Vinci's Mona Lisa!",Psycho
123,jimbo-53-186511,Finely crafted and superbly executed - it's still one of the best,9,27 January 2020,"Fed up with life, Phoenix-based secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is entrusted to take an important client's $40,000 to the bank one Friday afternoon. However, Marion sees this as the perfect opportunity to leave her old life behind and start afresh. After driving for a long period of time, Marion decides it's best to get a good night's sleep and checks in to the Bates Motel which is run by mild-mannered Norman and his domineering mother.I watched this film for the first time a number of years ago and remember being totally blown-away by it. Well it's fair to say that time has mostly being kind to this film as it is still quite an experience.Hitchcock wasn't called the master of suspense for nothing; of course much of the suspense comes later when we get to the Bates Motel, but there is one scene earlier in the film involving a policeman that achieves this effect with no dialogue (it literally is just a police officer staring at Marion from across the road, but it still managed to be pretty creepy). I also thought the voiceovers of conversations that are taking place in Marion's absence discussing her behaviour, motives etc were an excellent touch. A lot of filmmakers would have cut back to the office or to the car sales yard so we could see these people talking, but seeing it as a voiceover whilst Marion was driving was more suspenseful and tense and was a good move by Hitchcock.However, it's when the action moves to the Motel when the film really picks up a gear and this is mainly down to the wonderful duo of Hitchcock and Perkins; Hitchcock with his masterful direction in which he leaves a lot to our imagination (I remember the first time I watched this film how much I wanted to see inside the Bates house and how I was on the edge of my seat when Martin Balsam starts to creep up the stairs). However, in front of the camera the film most definitely belongs to Perkins and I think what I liked about his character is that, despite his nature, there is a certain vulnerability about him. Instead of being cool, calm and emotionless when under scrutiny he starts stuttering, mumbling his words, avoiding eye contact etc which are traits your average Joe would exhibit under the same sort of pressure. His nervy performance mean you don't always feel the way you should feel about him. Add to all this the wonderful score by Bernard Herrman and you really do have one hell of a film here.I originally rated this film with the perfect score when I last watched Psycho (which was before I started writing reviews). However, I had to knock a star off for the psychiatry report at the end - although it helps us gain an understanding of Norman's mind-set it went on for too long and for me tarnished the film slightly.. More so given the memorable ending prior to said psychiatry sequence.",Psycho
124,Nazi_Fighter_David,A classic essential cinema!,10,14 October 2005,"""Psycho"" is the most astounding, daring, and successful scary film ever made... Hitchcock uses pure cinema to arouse audience emotions...For the first forty minutes he cautiously builds up sympathy and audience identification with a troubled fugitive, a young estate secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who wants to marry Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but neither can afford it... Entrusted, by a wealthy customer, with $40,000 to put in a safe deposit box in a bank, she succumbs to temptation and steals the money in order to start a new life with her lover... So the motive is love! We begin to feel the tension when she's spotted  leaving Phoenix, Arizona  by her boss who thinks she remains in bed with a headache... Then, when she pulls off the highway to take a nap and is awaken by a suspicious patrolman  in disturbing dark glasses  who trails her... Hitchcock's trademark paranoia about the police is here at his best...Frightened and tired by a violent rainstorm, she stops at Bates Motel and has a small talk with a twitchy cordial motel keeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins-in an outstanding performance), an attractive shy young man who seems uneasy around her and can't even bring himself to pronounce the world bathroom...The movie turns dark and claustrophobic when she overheard the voice of Norman's mother speaking sharply with her son, and after she learns Norman's strong devotion to his irritable mother...Alone in the room, she strips to shower Safe and relaxing, the hot air rises as the water cascades over her Suddenly she turns at a sound, her eyes dilate with horror and her repeated screams rend the air as a hand from nowhere holding a long knife plunges it repeatedly into her body Her blood, mingling with the water, flushes down the drain in one of the most terrifying images of modern cinema No one who saw the film will forget the shock effect of that scene... Not only because of its terrifying realism, with the blood gushing and swirling on the shower floor; but also because Leigh was a sympathetic and star figure Although she had stolen, we felt involved with her (as we were involved with Marnie); we wanted her to get away; and here, with two-thirds of the film still to got we watched helplessly as the life and the beauty and the hopes were butchered out of herThe movie is only off one third when Hitchcock's spiral close-up of her unmoving eyeball reveals the nightmare... But the movie does really begin after her murder because once she is killed, we never stop thinking about her...With Marion Crane gone, our attention is shift to the sensitive Norman with a passion for birds and mother... They are very close and he guards her jealousy... As three people began to investigate, our sympathies were subtly maneuvered to the good-looking young man who, it seemed, must try to protect a homicidal mother We see him distraught, cleaning up and disposing of Marion's car, with her body and cash, into a swamp... We have no reason to think that he himself have done the dirty work... So could his crippled old mother be the vicious murderer? Or do we have some other reason to suspect that Norman's abusive mother does not exist? We heard the old woman talking constantly to him and we see Norman carrying her to the cellar... Or is it another Hitchcock's trick? But the knife comes out again striking and killing... The high angle shot shows perfectly her mad menacing rush from her bedroom... Hitchcock's version is definitive, a terrifying insinuating thriller with only two sudden and vicious murders... A classic essential cinema with his rich, vivid and effective imagery in the use of light and shadow; his voyeurism when Perkins spies on Leigh in a black bra (The first time he shows a lady disrobed); his 'metaphysical vertigo' in the overhead shot as Norman drags his mother down to the cellar...",Psycho
125,smatysia,Hasn't aged that well,6,4 August 2014,"I do realize how ground-breaking this film was. I was born a year before the premiere, and it was still widely talked about ten to twelve years later. Janet Liegh was yet another of Alfred Hitchcock's cold blondes. And it is hard to do a better tormented crazy than Anthony Perkins. But I am not at all sure that this film has aged well. Some of Hitchcock's iconic visual images, such as the camera looking into the shower head, and the camera following the detectives face in tight as he is falling down the stairs, are still being copied today. But there is so much ""arty"" direction today that it badly distracts from the films. And that sort of blows back on Psycho. Still a classic nonetheless.",Psycho
126,barnabyrudge,A master-class in screen suspense.,10,31 March 2008,"Arguably the most legendary film of all time, Psycho is a disorientating and thoroughly absorbing thriller from Alfred Hitchcock. The film has, to some extent, been hurt by years of imitation and variation. but taken strictly on its own terms it is one of the finest examples of a director manipulating his audience into the exact state of mind that he wants them.In Phoenix, Arizona, bored real-estate secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is having an affair with a man called Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but fears the relationship will never work out because he is reluctant to leave his wife. She is entrusted by her boss to take $40,000 to a deposit box in the local bank, but Marion senses an opportunity to carve a better life for herself and takes off with the money. She travels towards San Francisco, but en route finds herself in a ferocious thunderstorm. Marion checks into a motel for the night  the seemingly innocuous Bates Motel. Here she is befriended by the shy and nervous proprietor Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who lives in a huge, run-down house overlooking the motel shacks and seems to be very much under the constant scrutiny of his domineering mother. Later that night, while taking a shower, Marion is brutally murdered by a shadowy knife-wielding killer. Norman blames the crime on his mother and in a state of distress hides the body. Later, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam, aided by private eye Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), start searching for the missing woman. The trail leads eventually to Bates Motel, and an unexpected discovery concerning the truth about Norman's mother.Psycho is an example of pure cinema  Hitchcock doesn't merely follow a singular narrative, but employs every trick in the book (plus a few new ones invented specifically for the film) to extract maximum suspense. For forty minutes or so, the film seems to be a film about a confused woman running away with some money that isn't hers. But the brutal murder - of what we perceive to be the main character - is a masterstroke of audience disorientation. Once the film's biggest star, and the character we have up to that point followed, has been killed how can we feel safe and secure about anything that is to come? The shower scene itself is incredibly powerful  Hitchcock turns us, the audience, into voyeurs. It's hard to believe that there isn't a single shot of the knife actually making contact with Marion's body  via brilliant editing and sound effects we are actually convinced that we have seen all that happen, but most of the horror exists in the viewer's mind. Bernard Herrman's strings-only score is quite marvellous and adds additional suspense to an already thrilling film. And the acting is simply superb, with Perkins the obvious stand-out as the complex and enigmatic Norman Bates. The film has been written about, celebrated and analyzed so much that some of its novelty has been slightly diminished.. but for anyone who has the slightest interest in the mechanics of a ""real"" thriller, this is the ultimate experience.",Psycho
127,MissSimonetta,Gets better and better on further acquaintance,10,4 November 2020,"PSYCHO might be hard for some modern audiences to appreciate. It's slow, it's in black and white, it's a horror movie lacking gore or jump scares. Its most shocking elements seem standard. However, the greatness of this film comes in its tight, precise filmmaking and the wealth of wonderful little details-- the subtle parallels between Marion and Norman, the way Norman takes on birdlike mannerisms, the way the black and white makes the ordinary settings seem all the more gothic and sinister.Just as clever as the protagonist fakeout is the Macguffin fakeout. Macguffins are usually meaningless in and of themselves, but never moreso than in PSYCHO, where everyone thinks the Macguffin is the centerpiece of Marion's disappearance.I first saw this movie as a teenager and my love for it only grows the more I see it. It might even edge out VERTIGO as my favorite Hitchcock.",Psycho

Janet Lee plays a woman who decides to steal a large sum of cash and escape with it. The problem is she stops off to stay at the Bates Hotel overnight(which was definitely a mistake) and runs into the Bates family -- or at least it appears this way. Anthony Perkins is excellent as the disturbed son of the messed up family who covers up for his supposed mother's mistakes in the true good son fashion. The mystery behind the movie is determining who did the evils to Janet and others in the Bates Hotel. Hitchcock brilliantly keeps us guessing til the end as well as providing the shocks that we expect from the movie. This is the ultimate weird family scary movie that others have tried to imitate(some well and some badly), but they never match the excellent direction done by the master storyteller. There is the much imitated shower scene, but the overall movie in general is well written and put together and the one scene shouldn't make the entire movie(which it doesn't here).

That night she gets caught in a really bad rainstorm in the desert, and she spots the bright lighted sign of the Bates Motel, which she decides will be her destination for now. She checks in, and the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), makes her a sandwich. He seems nice, if not a little strange. She then goes to her room, undresses, while Norman spies through a hole in the wall.She enters the bathroom, and begins taking a shower. And I'm sure most of you know what happens from there on. Anyways, Marion's sister and lover begin to worry about her disappearance and hire a detective to investigate.""Psycho"" is a true classic, plain and simple, and one of the best horror films in history. The whole story (based on the book by Robert Bloch) is very interesting and the film keeps you guessing, because you never really know who Norman's mother is - the mystery shrouded around it all is effective and eerie. The infamous shower scene is now known by thousands of people, so it's kind of trademarked this series of films (although all of the sequels are awful besides ""Psycho II"", which was just alright), and the editing of the scene defines the ""less is more"" saying. The tricky editing used fools the audience into thinking they are seeing more than they are, and it is brilliantly done.After Marion's murder, Janet Leigh's presence is felt like a ghost throughout the rest of the film, while her sister and boyfriend try and find her. Anthony Perkins is near perfection as the kind but strange Norman Bates, he gives the character much depth and a feeling of unease. Janet Leigh is excellent as well in the role of her career as the ill-fated Marion. The film is black and white, which gives it that classic movie feel, I like old black and white movies, although you don't see very many horror ones. The pacing is excellent and the film holds interest wonderfully. The ending is a bit of shocker, and that final frame is one you won't shake easily.Ovearll, this is probably Hitchcock's best film ever. The story is great, the acting (especially by Perkins and Leigh) was pitch perfect, and the film was genuinely scary with some a heavy doses of suspense. The shower scene is classic, too - if there is one scene in all of Hollywood history that won't be forgotten, that shower murder is it.

The duality of his role must have been difficult to act with but he pulls it off beautifully.The one qualm I have is a common one. The exposition scene towards the end where the psychologist practically spells out the movie for you as if the audience are idiots who haven't been paying attention at all. I guess at the time psychological thrillers were far less common and the 1960's audience needed an explanation as to why Norman would dress up like his mother, but today this scene sticks out like a sore thumb.

All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, ""is not herself today."" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that ""Do-Not-Disturb"" sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word ""falsity"" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up ""Mother's"" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for ""Psycho."" Certainly ""Psycho"" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, ""Psycho"" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",Psycho
136,gcd70,The master's masterpiece,9,20 October 2007,"There have been many Hitchcock classics, but this is the ultimate, the master's masterpiece. I'm sure there is no need to divulge the plot as we would all be familiar with the evil goings on at the 'Bates Motel'. The cast are all spot on, as they play their parts with gusto, tongue in cheek and all. Miles and support are great, while Perkins and Janet Leigh are both marvelous as 'Norman Bates and Marion Crane respectively.""Psycho"" is Hitchcock's greatest achievement. Filmed in black and white, this dark, dark black comedy was a great joke on his then petrified audience, who now can see the hidden humour. Bernard Herrman's riveting score is fabulous. An absolute must!Sunday, November 8, 1992 - VideoHitchcock's marvelous technique makes this superb film immensely enjoyable time and time again. The more one sees ""Psycho"", the more one can appreciate the clever subtlety of his camera work, the darkness of his black humour and the sharpness of his direction, not to mention the brilliant performances of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.Yet for the first time viewer it still remains a wickedly manipulative movie which will shatter all your expectations.Fabulous!Saturday, October 9, 1993 - Video",Psycho
137,ferbs54,The Modern Horror Era Begins,10,21 June 2018,"It is not every filmmaker who can manage the difficult trick of coming up with four consecutive masterpieces, but that is just what British director Alfred Hitchcock was able to do as the late 1950s segued into the '60s. His 1958 offering, ""Vertigo,"" took time to find its audience but today is recognized by the British Film Institute's ""Sight and Sound"" magazine as the single greatest motion picture ever made; 1959's ""North by Northwest"" is surely one of the all-time great entertainments; 1960's ""Psycho"" practically jump-started the modern-day horror industry all on its own, and remains the director's most well-known film; and 1963's ""The Birds"" is still a baby-boomer favorite to this day. But of those four films, all of which reside on my personal Top 100 Favorite Films list, it is the third, ""Psycho,"" that remains my favorite after all these years, and indeed, I personally feel it is the greatest bit of work that the so-called ""Master of Suspense"" ever gave to an unprepared world. The film was a far cry from its predecessor, ""North by Northwest,"" a big-budget movie that had been shot in lavish wide-screen VistaVision and Technicolor and featured a sweeping, transcontinental story, replete with action and comedy and Cary Grant at his suavest. By contrast, ""Psycho"" was filmed on the cheap, utilizing Hitchcock's crew from his television program ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents""; the entire production was completed in just a few months at a cost of a mere $800,000 or so. But such was the power of the film, and its clever advertising and promotional gimmickry that insisted that no audience member would be allowed admission after the picture had started, that the box office for ""Psycho"" was enormous: around $50 million, a smashing amount of money for the time. And did it ever deserve it!I generally try to not include spoilers in these little minireviews of mine, but in the case of ""Psycho,"" I will go on the assumption that everyone knows the big reveal that comes at the picture's end, while at the same time endeavoring to be a bit coy, for the sake of those poor unfortunates who have NOT seen this masterpiece. As most of the world seems to know by now, or should, the film shows up what happens when a pretty secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh, in perhaps her finest hour), who works in a Phoenix real estate office, absconds with $40,000 of the company's money and hightails it by car to meet her lover, Sam Loomis (future U.S. ambassador to Mexico John Gavin) in California. Forced to take refuge during a sudden downpour, she stops for the night at the lonely Bates Motel, meets its gawky and awkward proprietor, Norman Bates (Tony Perkins, in the role that made him a star), and is later knifed to death--apparently by Norman's mother--while taking a shower in her room. (This, by the way, was not the first film to depict a woman being attacked while in the shower; indeed, just two years earlier, in the film noir ""Screaming Mimi,"" Anita Ekberg had been attacked in a similar manner, but the difference was, hers was an outdoor shower, with somewhere to escape to, and she was NOT killed during the attack.) Worried by her sister's disappearance, Lila Crane (Vera Miles) arranges to go with Sam to investigate. The two hire a private detective, Milton Arbogast (the great character actor Martin Balsam), to help in their investigations, and the trio eventually tracks Marion's disappearance to the motel, where they discover the grisly secrets that it hides.A bit of personal history here...and I may be revealing my age a bit by doing so. I am old enough to remember when ""Psycho"" was first released, in June of 1960, although I was just a wee lad at the time. I remember seeing the trailer for the film in a theater, although I did not realize until many years later, when I saw the trailer again as an adult, what it had been. And I remember the effect that this film had on many of the grown-ups in my neighborhood, particularly on one woman, Tika, who would not take a shower again for many months after she first saw it. The picture, of course, was a genuine shocker for film audiences of the era. Never before had a movie star of the magnitude of Janet Leigh been so suddenly killed off...and just 40 minutes into the picture! Today, naturally, anything goes, and any star can be unceremoniously knocked off in any manner. We've pretty much seen it all at this point, what with the advent of slasher flicks and torture porn films, but back in 1960, this kind of thing was brand new. People today just cannot imagine how shocked and stunned the 1960 audiences were at the time; what a sensation this film was. The word of mouth was terrific, leading to the box office figures mentioned above. As a youngster, I took all this in but of course was not allowed to see the film by my parents. It wasn't until I was in my very early teens that ""Psycho"" was first shown on television, and by then, I was more than primed. Thus, having been dared by some friends that I would not have the courage to ever see this film alone, I sat down to do so one night. My parents and sister, for some reason, were not in the house, and I manfully plunked myself down on the floor and watched this celebrated horror legend on my ownsome. After all, I figured, I'd already seen 1959's ""House on Haunted Hill"" any number of times (a good preparation, as it turned out!), and how much scarier than THAT could this picture be? Well, the shower scene of course frightened me, as did the shocking murder of Arbogast on the stairs (one of Hitchcock's greatest set pieces), but it was the final revelation of Mrs. Bates in that damp and musty fruit cellar that really got under my skin. Still, I made it to the end, and breathed a huge sigh of relief; I had made it all the way through, and had something to discuss with my friends. In the intervening 50 years or so, I have watched ""Psycho"" God knows how many more times on both the big screen and small, and it never seems to get old for me. (That, by the way, is the hallmark of all of my Top 100 films; the fact that I can watch them over and over and over with undiminished enjoyment.)Today, ""Psycho"" manages to hold up very well indeed, despite the fact that we are all aware of the film's secrets and know just when the jump scares are about to pop out. At this point, there is very little to say about the film that has not been said before. It has probably been discussed and analyzed more than any other Hitchcock film, and the books and articles written about it are legion. As a matter of fact, just last year, a new documentary, ""78/52"" (respective references to the number of setups and editing cuts), was released that centered on just the shower scene alone! I could certainly not improve on any of those commentaries, but would especially recommend to those who are interested Danny Peary's very informative article on the film, to be found in his indispensable reference book ""Cult Movies 3."" (It was Peary who first made me realize that the film gives us a woman named Crane who becomes the victim of a man who likes to stuff birds, and how the director makes his audience feel guilty by making us all feel like voyeurs throughout the picture.) The film contains so much to love that it is difficult to know where to begin. But let's start with the wonderful script that Joseph Stefano--who would go on to even greater fame a few years later as producer/writer for the classic TV show ""The Outer Limits""--was able to come up with, based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel. (Interestingly, the Norman Bates character in the novel is something of a big fat slob, on the order of a Victor Buono type; thus, Perkins was a very unlikely choice to play this particular role.) It is a wonderful script, witty and penetrating, that intersperses its shocks at just the right moments, and is perhaps never better than in the telling scene in which Norman and Marion converse in the parlor before she takes her good-night shower. The actors in the film are all marvelous, down to the smallest bit parts, and Hitchcock's manipulation of his audience, and the way he moves and places his camera (as in the spiraling descent into Marion's dead eyeball after the murder, and the overhead shot of Mrs. Bates attacking Arbogast), are by now legendary. Perhaps best of all, though, is Perkins. What a wonderful job he does here! Notice his hips sway as he ascends the stairs in the creepy Victorian mansion that is the Bates home, or the look of fear and then relief on his face as he attempts to sink that corpse-containing car in the nearby swamp. Amazingly, the audience sympathizes with him as he covers up for his homicidal mother, and that is no small feat. And, oh, let's not forget one of the most key elements in the entire film, that sensationally frightening score by the great Bernard Herrmann, composed solely of strings (violins and cellos); surely, one of the most instantly recognizable film scores ever created, and so very influential on future composers for horror pictures. ""Psycho"" was a groundbreaker and a trendsetter in many departments, but here's something that you may not have heard before: It was also the first film that ever showed the inside of a toilet bowl, a fact that caused all manner of uproar among the decency and censorship groups. (Isn't it funny what some people will choose to get upset about?) I could go on forever about this film, but I will leave you with this one fun fact: The shower curtain that I have right now in my bathroom at home is a clear one, and come to think of it, I have been purchasing see-through shower curtains for many decades now. Is this a subconscious effect brought on by this truly remarkable film? Could very well be! After all, if the Bates Motel had featured clear shower curtains in its rooms, Marion Crane might still be alive and well today....",Psycho
138,caspian1978,Hitchcock's best film !,8,24 June 2001,"It's sad but true, Hitchcock is known today by many for one movie and that movie is Psycho. With over 80 films to his list of films, only one stands out as his. Many people don't know this but Hitchcock's Psycho reflects a lot of his own life in 1960. His wife had recently had a stroke during  the production of Psycho. A lot of his fears of death and horror came out in the filming. Plus, for 1960 a black and white film was considered wrong? Why film in black and white when you can do it in color. Still, the Best Picture that year was THE APARTMENT and guess what that was filmed in?",Psycho

140,Jonny_Numb,"""A Standard Rave""",9,6 November 2006,"Strange what the passage of time can do to a film. I remember seeing portions of ""Psycho"" when I was very young on local TV; when our household became cable-ready a few years later and AMC showed actual movie classics, Hitchcock's film was regular on the rotation. I remember being shocked and impressed by Janet Leigh's shower demise and Martin Balsam's staircase tumble, but not too wild about the actual narrative. When you're less than 10 years old, you take for granted a lot of the nuances of film-making that only make sense when you're older.And ""Psycho"" is almost entirely nuance and technique. From Anthony Perkins' legendary performance as the quiver-lipped, boyish Norman Bates to Bernard Herrmann's piercingly authorative, all-strings score to Hitchcock's intersection of characters (where misunderstandings and misplaced responsibility are the norm), the film is a masterful blend of all the elements that make for quality cinema. And for all its pop-culture influence (as it was one of the first 'psychological horrors' put on screen), ""Psycho"" remains extremely subtle and surprising, even if you know all the plot turns in advance.See Marion. See Marion embezzle $44 grand from her boss. See Marion on the run from her own guilt. See Marion make a fateful stop at the Bates Motel. See Norman. See Norman talk about his abusive, domineering mother... (I needn't go any further.) Since there is really no creative way to write about a film that has already been so extensively written on, I offer some of my personal favorite moments: The head-on shots of Marion (Janet Leigh) driving away from responsibility, listening to dialogues taking place far away, her facial expressions our only indicator of emotion. The judgmental look of the used-car salesman. The way Norman leans his head forward in the parlor, becoming somber and defensive over the word 'someplace.' The shriek of strings as the shower curtain is pulled back. Norman's awkward reaction to Private Investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam)'s casual questioning. Arbogast's oblivious, seemingly slow-motion ascent of the staircase. Mrs. Bates' closing monologue, delivered in an acrid voice whose tone will literally make your skin crawl.And there's a lot more. As much as it's been said already, I will have to concur that ""Psycho"" is probably Hitchcock's masterpiece (I haven't seen all of his films), a near-seamless blend of story, character, irony, and technique.",Psycho
141,Steffi_P,"""Our private traps""",9,27 December 2010,"The horror genre has often thrived on tales of the unknown, the inexplicable and the supernatural, and this can be very effective in its own way. However there has long been another tradition of scaring people with more worldly horrors, with the genuinely unnerving touch of wholly possible events, familiar settings and the thought that this could happen to you too. And who else would be behind one of the most seminal and iconic entries in this subgenre but Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock, the director who specialised in bringing real-world terrors home to his audience.Perhaps the main secret to Psycho's success is the unusual structuring of its screenplay. The adaptation by Joseph Stefano contains more or less all the actual events of the original Robert Bloch novel, except that the emphasis has changed. The novel was told largely from Norman Bates's perspective, with Marion Crane turning up on his doorstep a few chapters in. However the adaptation brings us in to the story with Marion, telling the first half of the narrative through her eyes. This not only provides one of the biggest red herrings in the history of the thriller, it is a really effective way of keying us into the story on the level of an ordinary ""everywoman"", albeit one who has stolen a large sum of money, but even this the script goes to lengths to rationalise, embroiling us in her growing paranoia.But the screenplay would be worth little if it wasn't for the fact Hitchcock knows exactly how to present this material. He uses a lot of long takes in the scenes with Janet Leigh, using his roving camera to keep us with her, or at least with her thoughts, as for example when the camera pans down to the pile of money on the bed then over to the suitcase. Such manoeuvres can be very gimmicky and intrusive, so a director can only really get away with them if the picture is otherwise utterly compelling, which of course Psycho is. Hitch contrasts the long takes with a choppy editing pattern when Anthony Perkins is around, as suited to the awkward oddity of his presence. One of the director's finest constructions is the scene where Leigh and Perkins talk together in the parlour, surrounded by all those stuffed birds, a rather long scene, heavy on dialogue, and thus one that could easily become boring. However Hitch creates several modulations in tone simply by varying his angle. For example, when Bates is angered by Marion's suggestion that his mother be put someplace, Perkins is shown in profile, with that predatory owl prominent at the top of the screen, while the contrasting shots of Leigh become close-ups, looking vulnerable with her back to the wall.And one of the biggest keys to the realism (and therefore the ability to disturb) of Psycho is the quality of the acting performances. Janet Leigh plays a very credible game of trying to balance outward calmness and inner turmoil, which is really crucial to make the picture work. If the average audience member is to empathise with her character, we have to believe that she is not some hardened criminal, and that she is racked with guilt and fear of getting caught. Martin Balsam is great too as the easygoing private investigator, making his character likable by the naturalism of his performance. Finest of all however is of course Anthony Perkins, the genius of whose performance is the simplicity and fragility with which he plays Norman Bates, and that edge of menace he suddenly brings out of nowhere. His turn here is ideally suited to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense, as it treads that line of allowing the audience to be taken in by one red herring, but is also believable in retrospect once the truth is finally revealed.I'll finish with a quick word on the musical score for Psycho. While Bernard Hermann's ""stabbing strings"" have been cited and praised as much as virtually every other aspect of the picture, I'm also struck by the similarity between the main theme (the sharp, tense piece that plays over the opening credits and several other scenes) and the penultimate movement of the Russian composer Modeste Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. This latter piece refers to a macabre Slavic folk tale about a witch who kidnaps and murders children. Whether or not the link is deliberate, both pieces of music strike the same tone to suit their grisly and terrifying subject matter.",Psycho
142,ShootingShark,"Mother ! Oh God, Mother ! Blood ! Blood !!",8,22 October 2008,"In a moment of madness, Marion Crane steals forty thousand dollars from the office she works in and drives to see her lover in the neighbouring state. En route, she stops off at a lonely motel where she meets the curious proprietor, Norman Bates, and decides to try and undo her folly. An altogether different and more grisly fate awaits her however There are three things about Psycho which I think make it so extraordinarily brilliant. One is Hitchcock's direction, which is faultless; this is one of the few films where I can't think of any way it could be made better. Another is the sheer daring of the movie, both in terms of its subject-matter (an Oedipal, matricidal, necrophiliac, psychotic transvestite as a main protagonist was pretty strong for 1960) and its amazing structure, in which the heroine is murdered after forty-five minutes, something no other film has done (though some are close contenders, e.g. L.A. Confidential). Most of all however, I love the way it redefined my favourite genre of horror films. Prior to Psycho, every horror movie had a physical monster, whether it was Dracula, King Kong, The Fly, whatever. Psycho has a monster - its true face is revealed just after Lila Crane finds Mrs Bates, screams in horror and turns around - and it's a man. The monster isn't some alien creature, it is a person. It is us. A thousand fine movies have then built upon that - Repulsion, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Taxi Driver, Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Silence Of The Lambs - but they were all born out of Psycho. Great directors like Dario Argento and Brian DePalma have essentially spent their careers remaking it (see the latter's Dressed To Kill and Raising Cain particularly). Hitchcock never thought of it as a horror movie, but it is in the truest sense; it's horrifying, the example par excellence of masterful audience manipulation through suspense into a state of delirious anxiety. On paper it is a crime thriller, from an excellent pulp novel by Robert Bloch, and it can be taken that way, but it has so much Gothic spookiness I find it impossible to do so; the nightmarish old Bates house, the grisly fruit cellar, the murky swamp, Norman's eerie stuffed birds in the parlour, the final superimposed subliminal image of Mother's skull on Norman's face. Is his mind simply broken, or is she a vengeful spirit which possesses him ? One of my favourite ideas in the story is how Marion actually gets off the highway when driving through the night. Technically, it's just a device to advance the plot. Logically, she gets lost in the storm. Personally, I think it's some sinister spell that leads her to her doom at the Bates Motel, like a bewitched innocent in a fairy-tale. Both Perkins and Leigh are stunning in this movie; he for his incredible mannerisms and hawkish stare, and she for her stunning intensity and world-weary introspection. Their supper scene together in the back-office is one of my favourite dialogue scenes of all time as these two lost souls briefly connect, baring their souls despite speaking in riddles; ""We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you ?"". The role was something of a curse for Perkins, who never really got to play a mainstream part later, but he created an unforgettable character who is at the very top of cinema's long list of social outcasts. His final scene sitting in the cell is one of the most profound and frightening pieces of acting I have ever had the privilege to watch. Equally stunning is Bernard Herrmann's riotous all-string score, with its famous screeching violins and rhythmic cellos. As with the best movies, the music is really the dramatic anchor of the film, hugely inflating all the suspense and terror - when the famous shower sequence batters us into submission, it is the assault on our ears just as much as our eyes which floors us. For those of you who think the Oscars reward quality film-making, this is a good example of a stunning movie which won no Academy Awards, losing out to such cinematic greats as The Apartment, Butterfield 8 and Sons And Lovers. Arguably the greatest of Hitchcock's masterpieces (though I prefer The Birds) and undoubtedly the most influential; it was followed years later by three direct sequels (the first of which is very good) and a pointless shot-for-shot colour remake. Hitch appears in his standard walk-on as the man in the cowboy hat outside Marion's office.",Psycho
143,truemythmedia,One of the Best from One of the Best,10,30 January 2020,"""Psycho"" is a masterpiece of both filmmaking and storytelling, and it's also probably one of the most influential films ever made (no hyperbole needed). While Alfred Hitchcock's career is stuffed to the gills with thrilling, horrific stories (""Frenzy"", ""The Birds"") and intriguing mysteries (""Vertigo"", ""Rope""), this film is sort of the best of both worlds; it starts off as one thing and morphs into something entirely different. ""Psycho"" has some of the best subversions of expectations I've seen brought to screen, and that's only looking at this movie from a storytelling standpoint; from a filmmaking standpoint, this film is a technical marvel, and that infamous shower scene is to this day being touted as one of the best edited minutes of cinema history (if you've got the time, check out the documentary ""78/52""- about the seventy-eight setups and fifty-two cuts used in the scene). This is my personal favorite of Hitch's films, and I think it's also the best thing he ever made (sorry ""Vertigo"", ""Notorious"", ""Rear Window"", ""North By Northwest"", and ""Rebecca"").",Psycho
144,Spondonman,Director's Cuts,8,3 February 2008,"When this was shown on UK TV as a classic for the first time in the mid '70's I considered myself a horror film fan and I thoroughly enjoyed watching it. Since then of course the Hollywood horror film has ""progressed"" to the stage where only perversion and gore are considered fit entertainment meaning most people today would sadly now probably equate Psycho to their ideas of Mickey Mouse. However it remains to me the best of its kind, and as violent and sleazy as I'd want anything to get. Will tomorrow's film buffs think the Saw movies of today laughably non-violent too?Woman steals money from employer and scrams but unfortunately runs into homicidal maniac who polishes her off as she's getting second thoughts  about coming clean! Leigh's shower scene is justly famous – I guess Hitch the voyeur would have been tickled by the microscopic attention it still gets. There was even a stultifying gigantic slow motion frame by frame movie exhibition in London in 2006 by some idle Arthead extending the 40 seconds into 6 or 7 hours. Really worthwhile to have a stab at! When I was a kid Arbogast getting it at the top of the stairs startled me the most, although if you see it again you wonder how he could defy gravity while dying. That moment with Perkins biting his fingernails as the car stops sinking into the mud! It has a fantastic plot (in the best sense), with Hitch pulling out all of the cinematic stops he could think of, that keeps you hooked to the pervy climax and thoughtful ending. As with a few other films, such as Once Upon A Time In America, the music score is integral and vital as Hitch recognised – without Herrmann's zigzag music you might as well have been watching a (better) Corman.If something is labelled ""classic"" it doesn't have to be good or feelgood as well, but Psycho certainly was the first two.",Psycho
145,Reviews_of_the_Dead,An Important Film to Cinema History,10,29 October 2021,"This film I have fond memories of. My mother showed it to me when I was growing up and despite my not liking black and white films then, I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I thought the twist was absolutely amazing and the cultural significance of this film is immense. I've seen his movie many times throughout the years, with the last few times in the theater. I even took Jaime, as she had never seen this version as well. The official synopsis is a Phoenix secretary embezzles $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother.We kick off this one with a couple in a motel room. The woman is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her lover is Sam Loomis (John Gavin). They meet up here because they aren't married. Sam loves her, but he is divorced and has a lot of debts. Marion loves him and wants to marry. She is getting frustrated with their relationship. She just wants to be with him. This is an interesting dynamic for the time period.That is when something pops up that could help their situation. Her boss brings in a client that is trying to buy a house for his daughter and comes in with $40,000 in cash. Marion is asked to take it to the bank. She inquires if she can go home afterwards due to a headache. What she really does is heads home, packs and tries to flee. Her boss sees her in the car though or at least he thinks he does.What I really like about the next sequence is that Marion is hearing the voices of everyone back in Phoenix. She is thinking about what is probably happening, even though she has until Monday to get away, as these events happened on a Friday. I like this, because this is exactly what I do about a lot of situations in my life. I will play them in my head for all possible scenarios, your normal overthinker. It does seem these are the exact conversations that are being had as well.Marion has a run-in with a highway patrol officer and this causes her to trade in her car and buy a used one. She then plays out what happens there in head as well. She doesn't make things easier as she comes off very suspicious. She is vague in her answers and she does things that are highly unusual.It starts to rain so she pulls off to a motel. It turns out to be the Bates Motel and she meets with the proprietor, Norman (Anthony Perkins). They get along pretty well and it is clear that he is attracted to her. There is an issue that arises with his mother and him not giving her dinner. This all leads to the infamous shower scene.Something that I didn't notice in my previous viewings of this film is that Marion changes her mind about what she is trying to do after she speaks with Norman. This makes what happens to her effect me even more, because she is going to try to do the right thing despite what she did. I also want to comment on the impact of what happens to her as well. Most of us already know the twist here, heck I believe there are a lot of people who know this scene without even seeing this film. This is iconic, because it changes cinema and influences great films like Scream.When Marion goes missing, her sister Lila (Vera Miles) seeks out Sam and so does Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), a private detective who is searching out the stolen money. This all leads everyone back to the Bates Motel and to learn the truth about Norman and his mother.The issues with Norman are also interesting. It isn't the textbook definition of split personalities, as they can talk to each other. The final images we see in the fruit cellar end up influencing films going forward like Dressed to Kill.Acting in this film is also quite amazing. Perkins is perfect as Norman. The novel has him overweight and kind of greasy looking. This film makes it unnerving that he has the boy next door looks and he seems quite harmless. Knowing what he is capable of though makes it that much scarier. Miles and Gavin are solid as the two who are trying to figure out what happened to Marion. Leigh is amazing and what happens to her is iconic for cinema to come. The rest of the cast round out the film very well for what was needed also.Runtime on the film is 109 minutes, but it doesn't feel like it. We move through the plot points at a good clip. I even thought it was interesting that I knew the outcome of the mystery, but this time around I was focusing more on things that I didn't notice in previous viewings of the film. The only thing that I didn't like is the psychologist who is explaining Norman and his psyche. I don't mind it to an extent, but I think it goes too far. It is interesting getting in giallo films, as they took this concept along with villains across genres. The final image of Norman is great as is the actual reveal as well.As for the effects, there aren't a lot of them. A lot of this goes to the time period and what they could show. The shower scene is amazing though. We never actually see the knife penetrating due to the great editing, but we feel like we see it. The blood is good in that the water is washing some of it away and the splatters look realistic. The final image of the film has a cool effect that I had never noticed until these later viewings. The film is also shot amazing. I come to expect that from an Alfred Hitchcock film though.Something that really helps make this film feel eerie is the Bernard Herrmann's score. I actually listen to this one when I'm writing, because the music sets the perfect mood. There are some scenes that aren't even scary as to what we are seeing, but the music gives it such an unnerving feeling that it gets my anxiety going. The music cues during the shower scene are also iconic.Now with that said, this film is a classic. It is important film for many genres. It helped to spark the slasher films that could come a couple decades later. There is the issue of man being the monster and mental illness. It is shocking what it does with a popular actress like Leigh and quite iconic as well. The rest of the acting is great as is the story overall. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but what is used are great as is how the film is directed. The score also definitely helps this film and is also quite amazing. If you've never seen this classic, I recommend giving it a viewing. Even if you know what the reveal is, it is fun to try to pick out things to reinforce it. This film is very near perfect.",Psycho
146,lastliberal-853-253708,A boy's best friend is his mother.,9,7 April 2012,"Picking the best Hitchcock film to watch is an exercise that will totally frustrate you. There are so many great ones. When it comes to terror, no film can beat this one. Rear Window may edge it out (only by a hair) for excellence, but not for sheer terror.I really didn't recall the humorous set up in the beginning with Frank Albertson, but it did provide a way for Oscar nominee Janet Leigh and John Gavin to finally find happiness. Hard to believe a boss (Vaughn Taylor) would allow an employee to take the equivalent of $277,000 to the bank alone.I cannot understand why Oscar nominee Anthony Perkins wasn't at least nominated for his role here. I guess I couldn't think of one nominee that I could replace that year. Burt Lancaster won the Oscar for Elmer Gantry. Perkins did win at Cannes the same year for Goodbye Again.There were some other great actors in the film: Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Anderson, and John McIntire (""Wagon Train"").Great direction, great cinematography and a great story.",Psycho
147,davidmvining,Hitchcock twists the knife into the audience,10,11 August 2020,"This was one of Hitchcock's experiment films. After the lavish productions of Vertigo and North by Northwest, and while noting the financial success of smaller and cheaper B-movies, he decided that he wanted to make a movie for less than a million dollars. He hired a lot of the crew from his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and largely unknown actors like Vera Miles (who had played Henry Fonda's wife in The Wrong Man) and Anthony Perkins. Another thing he did to minimize the cost of the film was negotiate a contract with Paramount to reduce his own fee for a percentage of the ticket sales. Thinking the movie wouldn't make much money, Paramount was happy to oblige and Hitchcock ended up making the 2016 equivalent of about $150 million.The thing about this movie as a story is that it's almost an endless supply of red herrings from start until over-explained ending. Janet Leigh's character, the point of view character for the first forty-five minutes of the film, is a red herring. Norman's mother is a red herring. The idea that Norman buried another woman in his mother's grave is a red herring. The money is a red herring. It's not only the audience latching onto things that ultimately don't matter but characters as well as they circle around the problem but only come to the actual source in the movie's final moments. On paper, it feels like a movie that would annoy me rather than entertain me. It's just this side of lying to the audience, but Hitchcock maintains narrative discipline and integrity while playing with us so expertly that he gets away with it. It really is the best single example of what he said, ""Always make the audience suffer as much as possible.""The thing about slashers is that the genre has completely devolved to the point where the kills are the only important thing and the characters getting killed don't really matter. They're just meat for the grinder. Well, there are only two deaths in Psycho and both are of characters that we actually spend time getting to know. The first is obviously Janet Leigh's Marion Crane. She doesn't even arrive at the Bates Motel for a full half hour. Instead we get her relationship to Sam Loomis, a divorcee who pays alimony and lives in the back of a hardware store, her dreams of running away with him where money isn't an issue, and her job situation where she suddenly gets $40,000 in cash handed to her to place in the company's safety deposit box. Without any dialogue to explain her actions, she simply goes home, packs up her bags (changes from a white bra to a black one) and drives away from Phoenix towards California where her boyfriend lives.She drives, desperate to avoid detection, sleeping on the side of the road in her car, exchanging her car for another in California, and, in a rainstorm, stops at the hotel where she meets the proprietor, Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins as Bates is one of the key special ingredients to this film. From his innocent introduction to the sinister ending, he's complex and endlessly watchable. His first scene, from his greeting of Marion to wishing her goodnight after their small dinner in his parlor, is such a great moment. Despite his innocence, there's something off about him. He's too innocent for his age. He seems boyish instead of just nice, and then the conversation turns to his mother and a darkness comes out of him. This is the much better version of the first scene in Strangers on a Train. There, Bruno was far too aggressive too early for me to sell the ideas at play, but here, Norman Bates is such a disarming naïf for the first few minutes that his dark turn doesn't feel like it should send Marion screaming.Marion decides that her actions were not worthwhile and that she should go back, figuring out how much she owes from the money she used on her trip out, and then she dies. What sets Psycho apart from most modern slashers is that incredible cruelty for Marion because we, the audience, end up on her side, happy that she's going to return back, and then she dies. We spent forty-five minutes getting to know her, watching her make a huge mistake, and then begin to turn around on that mistake before she was taken away. It's emotional investment that's required for us to feel the murder. If she had been on screen for five minutes before her death, there would have been no investment on the part of the audience, but we feel her death and when the investigation of her death picks up in the second major portion of the film, heading by Sam Loomis, Marion's sister Lila, and the private investigator Arbogast, we want the investigation to move forward.And that's really important because of who the actual murderer is. This is where the red herrings play out really well. We're led to believe for most of the movie that Norman's mother is the killer as complex thoughts about Norman's innocence and loyalty to his mother play out. He becomes an accomplice, but his devotion to his mother who's so cruel to him is admirable at the same time. We end up kind of rooting for him, being on his side rather than Sam's when Sam comes to question Norman. It's so effective that as we see Norman in his final shot as his mother's voice speaks in voiceover, we still feel for Norman, lost in the blackhole of his mind to his mother's power over him. So, she ends up truly being the killer, but it's still Norman at the same time.It's Hitchcock playing with the audience, twisting the knife into them about expectations, emotional investment, and denouements. He's playing the audience like a fiddle, and it works so incredibly well. It's experimental, cruel, and wildly effective. For a movie that seems to rely so much on a twist, it holds up remarkably well because Hitchcock knew that it was more than just a twist. It was a story that needed fully fleshed out characters.",Psycho
148,Spleen,Please be careful,10,1 December 2001,"Robert Louis Stevenson's masterful novella ""The Strange Case of Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde"" takes the form of a mystery: at the start we're told that Jekyll and Hyde share a secret, but it's a while before we find out what that secret is.  These days, almost everyone already knows what the secret is, and NOT because they've read the story - rather, they've listened to some blabbermouth, who, BECAUSE ""everyone already knows"", feels himself licensed to spoil things for the few remaining people who don't.  Well, that blabbermouth won't be me.  And I'm not going to give away the surprises in ""Psycho"", either.Nor should you, if you know what they are.  This is a plea for people to be more circumspect with such information, even if such circumspection seems futile in the current climate.P.S.  Psycho is a great movie - possibly Hitchock's best, although there are four other contenders for that title.  But this much everyone really DOES know already.P.P.S.:  And if you think Hitchcock couldn't possibly have missed with this material, take a look at Gus Van Sant's almost ludicrously incompetent scene-for-scene remake.",Psycho

150,Seraphion,A classic thriller with probably the best twist at its time,6,3 August 2014,"Although the background conflict drive is introduced very early in the beginning, the story took quite a long time to build up until the first real conflict occurs. And it takes up to about half an hour to reach the real focus of the movie. The thriller aspect is kept very nicely using the conversation dialog with the camera shooting elsewhere or at outside of the conversation's room. The conflict's final climax is indeed a great twist. It may even be one of the best twists of its time. I like how the movie retains focus after the the character that has been the sole focus of the movie is depicted dead. The acting is just a decent one. What's quite irritating to me is that most of the male actors try very hard to have the fake commanding accent. Janet Leigh acted nice enough, though. She handled her gestures nice in making the conversations more alive.",Psycho

153,Movie-ManDan,"Finally, A Horror Movie With Actual Brains and Really High Intelligence!",10,11 November 2017,"Of all the genres, horror is the one where the amount of truly good movies are few and far between. It is the genre that's taken the least seriously. Its true that this is the single worst genre of all. Horror movies are clad with a over-abundance of blood, death, bad acting and no point. Of course horror is supposed to make people scared, but 95% of them fail. While Psycho is not scary like it was 57 years ago, it is still one of the smartest films ever made. And the type of genre that the genius film is, happens to be horror.Psycho is best known for the infamous ""shower scene,"" something everybody knows about. That happens to be the turning point. The movie is very good before, and even better after. The ""shower scene"" is not even the best part in the movie.Psycho starts off normal drama with a romance story worked in. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary whose life could be better. Her fiancée is Sam Loomis (John Gavin) and their wedding is on hold due to his debts. She is willing to start life anew and steals $40000 in cash. This happens minutes into the movie as it turns into a road thriller. She plans on evading Phoenix and use the money to build her new life with Sam in California. She knows what she did was wrong and is scared of being caught. We the audience hold our breath in hopes of Marion not being nabbed. Tired, she stops in the Bates Motel just for the night. She meets and gets to know the timid owner, Norman who has a domineering mother. She sees that Norman has low self-esteem and has a change of heart. Can her self robbery get redeemed?Then the film REALLY switches gears and becomes the horror movie it promises. There's the ""shower scene"" that derails the movie away from Marion stealing money and into Norman Bates. The ""shower scene"" had many cuts and changes of angles, with perfect cinematography so that the figure of Mrs. Bates would not be seen. Norman is devastated, but loves his mother dearly, getting rid of the evidence.Marion's sister Lila and Sam hire a detective to search for her. Lila and Sam are worried since they haven't heard from Marion, and they found out about her stealing the money. The detective checks out motels, ultimately landing at Bates. Norman's agitation and inconsistency has him suspicious. Lila and Sam make their way to Bates. They discuss Marion's situation with others in the area and wonder who killed for the money. When they find out Norman's motives and who his mother really is, the level of genius that this flick has kicks into overdrive.When Norman gets sent to an insane asylum, a psychologist explains his mental state. This is the best scene in the movie. One of my 10 favourite scenes in all of cinema. Norman and his mother (who really was domineering) lived as though they were the only two people in the world. She started dating again ten years earlier and Norman killed them both. Unable to cope with her death, he keeps her corpse well treated and acting like she was still alive. But that wasn't enough, he created an alternate personality of his mother and would sometimes dress up as her to maintain the illusion. Since he was jealous of her and her lover, he assumed she would be too. So when moments of passion would arise in Norman's life, the ""mother"" part of him would take over and kill. Norman fell in love with Marion and ""mother"" killed her. He had not idea about the money. If Norman felt any real sense of danger, the ""mother"" part would kill. ""Mother"" the detective. The ""mother"" part has consumed Norman's life.The whole flick is a psychological lesson in the mind of a madman. There are many other instances of intelligence that branch off. Although far from being the scariest film ever, it should still forever remain the best horror film ever.4/4",Psycho
154,invisibleunicornninja,Very boring.,4,22 November 2018,"This movie is so bad that I almost would've thought that I watched the wrong movie if it hadn't been for the opening credits. Are all these positive reviews fake? Has no one that has seen this movie also seen a good horror movie? Are people really that easily manipulated? I don't know. I'm going to try to avoid any spoilers in my review of this mess, as people seem to care about it, but honestly there is so little to this movie that there isn't really anything to spoil.The first hour of this movie is extremely boring. Everything is dragged out to pad the runtime. The entire opening scene doesn't even have anything to do with anything that happens after. Towards the middle of the movie, there is a scene in a shower that is so poorly edited and acted that it left me laughing hysterically. I'm pretty sure the scene was supposed to be scary, but honestly I can't see anyone being on the edge of their seat from a performance like that. After that scene, a detective character shows up, and he is kind of interesting, but he dies after less than 10 minutes, so it's kind of pointless. The movie remains mildly entertaining after that, but it's not amazing or anything.The main thing that makes me hate this movie is the closing scene. The truth about the villain is revealed in an exposition dump that lasts like 5-10 minutes. The reason why I don't like it is because this could've been a very interesting plot point that could've been developed over the course of the movie, but is instead just relegated to a plot twist. If we had spent the movie following a villain like that, it would've been really interesting, or maybe even scary. You could say that they didn't do this because they were focusing on the victims, but this movie has no character development. No one grows over the course of the movie, and you don't learn about the personalities or backstories of pretty much anyone.The filmmaking is ok. It's competant. Nothing special. The only interesting shot that stands out is one around a staircase. That's it.Overall, this is a really boring, pointless, and meandering movie with a wasted concept. The only reason why anyone is praising this is because people like Alfred Hitchcock. Or they're just easily scared? I don't know. I really don't recommend watching this one.",Psycho
155,p-stepien,Hitchcock Kickback,8,21 December 2013,"In true Hitchcockian 'shades of grey' office worker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) rashly decides to take a stash of cash from her employer and ditch Los Angeles to join up with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). With her internal moral regret mounting, even conspiring against her to the verge of paranoia, she ultimately ends up in a dilapidated off-road motel run by the reclusive, but amiable Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who literally has skeletons hiding out in his closet. When Marion Crane famously gets gutted in the shower by Bates' mother, her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and boyfriend Sam become aware of her disappearance and initiate a hunt. Similarly, her employer sends out detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to track down Marion and the stolen money.With a movie so awash with interpretations and reviews, not much noteworthy can be added, except from personal input, especially from the future-past perspective, as in: How does ""Psycho"" hold up against its contemporaries? And as such ""Psycho"", one of Hitchcock's best works, has aged pretty darn well, outdoing a vast majority of by-the-numbers rip-offs, due to the the ambiguous societal commentary lingering in between the killer rampage. Norman Bates, despite his awkward presence and facial tics, is by no measure a crazed psychopath, who deals in excess, instead Hitchcock affords his main antagonist a very thoughtful character structure, which also helps to build tension. Hitchcock, masterfully, builds context and content, especially with regards to the interaction between Marion and Norman, each running away from their own demons, suggesting that the difference between the two is much less pronounced, than we would like to believe. This gruesome take hits best during a genuinely fresh conversation between the two in the hotel office.Once the initial murder takes place, Hitchcock never lets go of a sense of tension, but the story focuses more on the thriller/horror essence, no longer affording space for such thoughtful commentary. Anthony Perkins carries the movie with his impish, offbeat, charm, delivering a still crisp and tense conversation with the nosey PI Arbogast. For the most part ""Psycho"" remains a gripping experience, even though age has caused many false notes to supplant true fright with corny music and overused shock gimmicks. As such the most famous scenes, including the bathroom murder and the big reveal, have lost their impact, referenced to death and outdone by the coming slew of slasher films. Possibly this even works for the better, as the much ridiculed sequences no longer define the movie, instead letting it breath by its own.",Psycho
156,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,The original slasher villain,10,16 May 2014,"There's a lot to say about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). For one thing, it would not have lit the fuse to the explosion of other unique slasher villains that everyone comes to know and enjoy at the movies. As crazy as this idea was back in the day, Hitchcock was able to push the boundaries of suspense and create a legend that practically no one can forget. Thankfully everything here is put together in such a way that it amounts to a very clever, creepy and disturbing movie.The story is about a girl named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is given a huge sum of money and is expected to deposit in the bank. However, she becomes greedy and decides to run off with it. While on her escape, she decides to rest at an old motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). There she learns that Norman is under the strict rule of his mother and that he's a slight bit unsettling. However, she doesn't realize how unsettling Norman really is. Co-starring Perkins and Leigh are several other veteran actors like Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and John McIntire.The writing is based off of Robert Bloch's work of the same name. Bloch himself had based it off of the disturbing real story of Ed Gein of Plainfield Wisconsin in 1957. What's great though is that Hitchcock kept everything identical to the book. Every scene that is depicted gives momentum to the plot and helps make the tension that much more gripping. The best actor here is Anthony Perkins. Not only are his reactions real but also feel genuine. For example, when telling a lie and then being found out, he tries to cover his tracks. He is able to do so but speaks nervously. As for the year, 1960 had some graphic violence come into play. Not enough to shock anyone, but creative enough to let the audiences' imagination run wild. Also, just because the film is in black and white doesn't mean for any viewer who doesn't like the ""old"" films, can't be entertained either. With the simplicity of color, there are other things for the viewer to watch and notice. Having only black and white actually simplifies the viewing experience for the audience. Accompanying that is Bernard Herrmann's all string score, with one of the most iconic tunes taking place in a shower scene. If you want to know where slasher films began, it's here.Norman Bates is the original slasher villain. Audiences will be clinging to the disturbing story, the acting is great and the music is memorable.",Psycho

The title in the movie refers to the psycho killer named Norman Bates (Tony Curtis) who's main target is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who gets killed by a knife set to the loud music of Bernard Hermann and some scary editing. But the movie doesn't end there, as the killer goes to his mom in the famous psycho house and tells what he had did before he gets caught red handed by cops after he kills his brother.

Psycho surprises the audience by breaking major film rules by killing off its central character mid movie. Hitchcock makes use of Macguffins throughout the movie such as $40,000 cash that Marion (Central Character) steals so that the plot and characterization of the movie can be propelled.

Even with a basic prior knowledge of what was going to happen, I was still completely enthralled by the whole thing. It takes several different turns in tone and content throughout, but it's all consistently well done. There are very few better examples of the words thriller and mystery than this one.

161,winner55,a brilliant puzzle game,10,4 September 2007,"*SPOILER* ""Psycho"" is something of a puzzle game, like the '3 dimensional chess' played in the old Star Trek TV show. When we think the film is moving in one direction, we find it has caught us up from behind on another level.On one level, the film is about guilt, but not in any way most people think about it. Janet Liegh's hapless victim is actually guilty of a number of old-fashioned sins - illicit sex, theft, lying, sloth, waste, hubris and self-obsession, all of which is soon to be discovered (after the film's end) when her car is dragged from the swamp revealing the stolen money in the trunk along with her body. Of course, the audience knows that she would have repented, had she lived, but nobody in the film will.Anthony Perkins' character, on the other hand, is guilty of - nothing. That's right, not a thing, nada, zip. That's because he's crazy: even his voyeurism is merely a manifestation of his psychosis. This is not simply a rule of Anglo-American law, by the way - it dates back at least to St. Augustine's Civitas Dei and his definitive statement that where the will is absent, there can be no guilt. And one cannot have will when the mind is so wholly disordered, it can no longer discern a choice to be made (that part is Aquinas).Perkins' psychopath thus becomes mere act of nature to the people he kills. If Leigh's character had decided to drive to a church for confession to a priest, and then suffered a fatal heart-attack at the wheel, the moral sociology of this would have been the same for her, discovered in a car with stolen money and no immediate sign that she repented of her sins.Does this make ""Psycho"" a heavy lesson in Christian morality? Absolutely not! Because Hitchcock is not playing just the one game, but several. As to the morality, for instance, it would certainly be a heavy message if it weren't so dam'ed obvious that Hitchcock doesn't take it seriously! The Freudian explanation, and Perkins' final dissolution into the persona of the dead mother form a bizarre bit of comic relief, intended to provide quick and easy explanations to any audience needing these.It may help some viewers to know that Hitchcock said that the only really frightening moment in the film - for him - was the sudden cut to a close up of a state trooper wearing sunglasses when Leigh awakes in her car. Hitchcock was almost paranoid about the police (it actually does show up in a number of films, beginning with ""Blackmail"" from '29). This is one reason his characters frequently seem to have nowhere to turn when they find themselves in legally questionable or suspect situations. And it is this state trooper who first suggests to Leigh that she ought not to sleep in her car but find a bed for the night - which suggestion finally leads to her decision to visit the Bates Motel....Well, who's guilty now?",Psycho
162,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,The most infamous title ever made,10,1 July 2015,"Low key, psychological thriller/ horror, groundbreaking in its time, it still holds up well today. Antiheroine steal thousands and goes on the run, takes refuge in the Bates Motel (briefly)Rather than just simply rehash the plot, like 12 billion other reviewers, I'll comment on two of my favourite scenes in this movieAs Marion chats with Bates over sandwiches that evening, we never really feel like there is any connection between the two. She is afraid of being found out, but so is Bates, so they do actually have something in common. They are both putting on a show for the other, pretending to have nothing to hide. Antiheroine and villain, conversing over sandwiches, sitting under watchful eyes of taxidermied animals. We don't see them in the same frame either which makes them both seem even more distant, detached. Another favourite scene is Bates' thin frame standing at the edge of the lake, silently contemplating Arborgast's death, as his car slowly sinks into the muddy Waters. This shot looks like a painting, a beautiful, perfectly done shot; yet it is also creepy, as its beauty conceals Bates horrifying crimes.(The exteriors of the house were used in the Thriller anthology series, episode 7, season 1, The Purple Room.)",Psycho
163,philip_vanderveken,"How could I ever capture the greatness of this movie in less than 1,000 words???",10,13 July 2005,"Let's be honest, when you are used to the horror movies of today and hope that this movie will be even a lot more scary than those movies, ""Psycho"" will be an incredible disappointment. The movie is a masterpiece, no doubt about that, but calling it horror isn't exactly right anymore. Sure, in the sixties, this must have caused a lot of nightmares, but we are used to a lot more nowadays. Still, that doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth watching anymore. It certainly is, I would even say more: this should be seen by everybody who is at least a little bit interested in movies...Marion Crane, working in a real estate office, hasn't had too much luck in life so far. She only sees her fiancé Sam during her lunch breaks and they can't get married because they don't have enough money. Sam is divorced and still has to pay off his ex-wife's alimony. She feels like she is stuck in a situation she can't get out of, but then she gets a golden opportunity. When Mr. Cassidy, a rich oil tycoon, comes to the office to give $40,000 in cash to buy a house for his daughter's wedding present, Marion is trusted by her boss to bring the money to the bank. But instead of bringing it to the bank, she takes the money to start a new life. She packs up and heads for Fairvale to see Sam, but when the night falls, she ends up at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman Bates. Norman is a nice young man, but he seems to be obsessed with his mother. After lunch, Marion returns to her room where she will take a shower, the last thing that she will do in her life...As I said before, if you think this will be a horror movie like you are used to see, than you'll be disappointed. But if you are looking for a very mysterious and suspenseful movie, which will not let you go until the credits are shown, than this is the best you can get. It's not for nothing that they call Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense. Many have tried to copy his work in more recent times, but not one of them has been able to make a movie as good as he did. The script for this movie is absolutely brilliant and the plot twist is timed perfectly. But ""Psycho"" is not only a masterpiece thanks to the story. The acting and the camera-work are at least as memorable. While all actors did a very fine job, it is Anthony Perkins who was the most perfect one of them all. Somehow he doesn't give the impression of playing his role, it's like the actor and the character have become one in this movie. Believe me, that's something you will not find very often. The same for the camera-work. Hitchcock understands the art (and you can take that word quite literally) of not showing everything and still making you understand what exactly is going on. There is only one other director who I know off that was also able to say so much with so little and who knew so well how to work with close-ups and that's Sergio Leone (Not that I'm comparing both men with each other, because the movies that they made couldn't be compared either, but in my opinion these are the two best directors ever).I really could go on for hours about this movie, but I believe that it is impossible to completely describe what this movie does to you. I'm convinced that this is a classic that should be seen by everybody. And for such a classic there is only one appropriate rating and that is 10/10. Nothing more, nothing less.",Psycho
164,Luigi Di Pilla,Efficient creepy thriller from Hitchcock,7,1 June 2008,"I watched PSYCHO last night on TV and during the movie I was never bored. PSYCHO is no doubt one of the best of Alfred Hitchcocks work. He filmed a very interesting novel that the film industry of nowadays misses so much if you know what I mean. Yes, it is one of the very first original creepy psycho thriller ever published. Each scene is accompanied with a well adapted music score. Then the camera-work is top and every character is well developed and performed. Anthony Perkins became in this genre the symbol of the perfect psycho killer and finally this role helped him to get a great star for eternity. What I didn't like therefore was the black and white cinematography. It would have been so nice to see those beautiful colors of the sixties.If you liked it watch THE BIRDS or REAR WINDOW from the same director.Final vote: 7/10.",Psycho
165,valadas,Too unconvincing to be true,6,3 August 2006,"I never was a great Hitchcock fan and this movie did nothing to change my mind. It's indisputable that he makes very good movies from the formal-technical point of view and that he knows how to create a suspense and (or) horror atmosphere with great mastery and skillfulness but the stories he tells us are too fanciful to be real (despite the fact that they are presented as real)and when he dives into the psychological pathology of his characters he becomes much unconvincing. For instance in this movie the psychiatrist's explanation which takes place in the final scene doesn't seem to me to have great scientific rigor, looking more like pure fantasy. Nevertheless it's true indeed that this movie (like others he has made) keeps us stuck to our seats and wrapped up in the story unfolding from the first to the last scene. Only later and after the movie ends do we emerge from that spell to realize that all that has very little juice in terms of psychological reality. This movie has however also a remarkable feature in the performance of the great actor who is Anthony Perkins who makes and excellent character very well adapted to the role that the movie's director gave him and with great and talented sobriety.",Psycho
166,jacobs-greenwood,An Alfred Hitchcock must-see classic,10,6 December 2016,"What kind of director kills off his star (played by Janet Leigh) less than half way into his film? Only Alfred Hitchcock could (get away with it), of course. And what a killing too! You won't turn your back on the door to the bathroom when showering for a while after watching this shocker. From the stinging violin music to the murder itself, this much copied masterpiece has no peer. Its imagery was/is so memorable that it typecast Anthony Perkins for life.It's also impossible to forget the look of the house on the hill, the scene with Martin Balsam on the stairway, or the ending (smiling face) view of Norman Bates (Perkins) in the padded room. What begins as a ""woman on the run from the law"" film becomes a darkly humorous film about an unstable man. Vera Miles and John Gavin (among others) also appear. Joseph Stefano wrote the screenplay from the novel by Robert Bloch.The film received four Oscar nominations: Best Director, Best Supporting Actress (Leigh, her only Academy Award nomination), B&W Art Direction-Set Decoration, and B&W Cinematography (John Russell's only recognition from the Academy).

167,Takethispunch,First true splatter film.,10,23 June 2016,"The most original and influential moment in the film is the ""shower scene"", which became iconic in pop culture because it is often regarded as one of the most terrifying scenes ever filmed. Part of its effectiveness was due to the use of startling editing techniques borrowed from the Soviet montage filmmakers, and to the iconic screeching violins in Bernard Herrmann's musical score. The iconic shower scene is frequently spoofed, given homage to and referenced in popular culture, complete with the violin screeching sound effects (see Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, among many others).Psycho is a 1960 American psychological horror thriller directed and produced by Alfred Hitchcock, and written by Joseph Stefano, starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, John Gavin, Vera Miles and Martin Balsam, and was based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch. The film centers on the encounter between a secretary, Marion Crane (Leigh), who ends up at a secluded motel after stealing money from her employer, and the motel's disturbed owner-manager, Norman Bates (Perkins), and its aftermath.",Psycho

169,sme_no_densetsu,Time has dulled Psycho's cutting edge but it's still worth watching,8,14 August 2011,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is one of the most famous movies of all time. People who've never seen it are nonetheless familiar with the infamous shower scene and its spiky musical accompaniment. In a way, this familiarity works against the film, as does the parade of imitators down through the years.I'll admit that I may not be the most objective judge of this film's merit. I first saw the pointlessly faithful remake and I also read Robert Bloch's novel (which is the same in most respects). So, the movie was basically 'spoiled' for me, though with all of the references in popular culture you'd be hard-pressed to go into the movie 'fresh' to begin with. For a movie that hinges on a pair of twists, that's a considerable issue. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have other impressive elements, though.Janet Leigh received an Oscar nomination for her performance but as far as I'm concerned Anthony Perkins easily outdid her. He went unrecognized by awards bodies at the time but the character of Norman Bates is now one of the most famous creations in cinema. In support, Martin Balsam is a welcome sight while Vera Miles & John Gavin are acceptable though they aren't really given a lot to work with.Meanwhile, Hitch's direction was expertly handled, as always, and it resulted in the last Oscar nomination of his career. The cinematography was also Oscar nominated but I wasn't especially impressed by it, though I will say that the Oscar-nominated set decoration/art direction was indeed worthy of recognition. Bafflingly, Bernard Hermann's now-legendary score seems to have been completely ignored at the time.In the end, I think that ""Psycho"" ranks a bit below Hitchcock masterpieces like ""Rear Window"" & ""Vertigo"". Admittedly, there are some absolutely great parts but it also starts slow and has an overreliance on twists (which you might already know even if you haven't seen the movie). That's not even getting into the scores of lesser imitators that have explored similar territory over the years. So, while ""Psycho"" is undoubtedly a landmark film with some very impressive elements, I'd say that time has been kinder to its reputation than its content.",Psycho
170,wisewebwoman,The delicious hair-raising terror of it all!,10,29 October 2005,"As a teenage movie buff, three films profoundly affected me and this is one of them (the other two for the curious are ""War of the Worlds"" which I saw at far too young an age, and ""Witness for the Prosecution"" another Hitchcock effort with a completely unexpected gob-smacker of an ending).All three I have watched since, ""War of the Worlds"", though still an impressive sci-fi, no longer terrifies me, ""Witness for the Prosecution"" I've seen over and over and still put on my top 50 best films of all time and Psycho, well Psycho remains in a class all by itself. I am still gripped by the wonderful confluence of a great plot, marvelously acting, a superlative director and a score that enhances all of the above.No one needs details of the plot from me. Everyone knows the plot. I am a lifelong fan of the great Hitchcock so should mention I have a bias to all things Alfie. This remains one of his best and broke new ground when first released. Like the above-mentioned WFTP and ""The Exorcist"", movies now had a new twist; you could not be admitted to the theatre after the movie had started.As one can imagine, this engendered great excitement for the cinema audiences. What would the ending be? What were all the blood and guts warnings all about ? We read stories of fans passing out in the theatres where Psycho was played. We could hardly wait. We could not even imagine in our fevered brains what Hitch had created and was going to wreak amongst us.We were not disappointed. Psycho embodied every horror we had ever let fester at the edges of our imaginations and then some. The shower scene had our hearts and minds freezing over and gripping each other in delicious icy horror. The slashings did not have to be shown, barest glimpses of corpses were revealed. There was nothing graphic on screen. The true terror resided in our imaginations and lingers there still. Many of us lock windows and doors in our own houses when taking a shower; many of us have never taken a shower again.Once in the seventies I saw the set where this was made, the old house on the hill, and the remains of the motel. Perhaps it is all gone now. What a thrill, to see where it all began, to walk in the footsteps of the great Alfred.This is a 10 out of 10 for the breakthrough into a new genre of film-making. Absolutely faultless, unforgettable and imminently re-watchable. In magnificent black and white. Leigh, Perkins and supporting cast flawless. Bravo to all.",Psycho

172,KUAlum26,A film that will stay in you LONG after you've seen it,9,13 December 2005,"What more can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's most popularly received(perhaps not his best,quality-wise)film?Perhaps this: some forty-five years after it was released,it's still referenced and easily accessible movie in regards to movies creating visceral dread and natural shock. Even though Hitch wanted to make this as spare and nuanced a movie as he possibly could(note that this was a B&W film in 1960,when most movies had gone to color and various forms of ""Sens-a-round"" type cinema gimmicks of the period to capture.""shock"" and ""thrill"" moviegoers),the amount of care put into matching Bernard Hermann's tense score with the seemingly common-place events leading towards the horrors being hidden in the Bates Motel. Lastly,the show is a veritable maze of curiosity,where the film begins as a tracking of the moral quandaries of one MArion Crane(Janet Leigh,beautiful and haunting as a VERY weak and corruptible character here),who,working a dead-end job and having an affair with a married man,decides to abscond with $40,000 of an investor's money. Her run from,well,everything,leads her to the seedy BAtes motel and one Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins,whose long career boiled down to this role). The rest is pretty well-known by anyone familiar with this movie.This is a must-see for ANY film-lover.

173,pyrocitor,The grandfather of all slasher films,10,10 March 2006,"Master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock's already tremendously successful career reached arguably a new height with Psycho, a powerhouse film way ahead of its time (the filmmakers even seemed to realize this fact; the film's tagline was ""A new- and altogether different- screen excitement!!!"") which inspired and pretty much pioneered the slasher film genre. It's the story everyone knows, with innocent worker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) running from the law with a stolen $40 000, making the mistake of checking into a certain infamous motel along the way, run by a quirky and antisocial proprietor (Anthony Perkins) and his mysterious, never seen mother. The key to Hitchcock's classic as opposed to the hundreds of generic garbage teen slasher films theaters are unfortunately bombarded with every year, is the suspense element. Hitchcock proves his genius by realizing that the key to truly inspiring fear in the hearts of an audience is by showing less rather than more. Instead of having horrendously gory deaths every 30 seconds we have a single, infamous shower stabbing, which becomes all the more chilling by how we as an audience have to essentially imagine exactly what is happening. What is truly frightening about Psycho is the eerie tension constantly building throughout the film, reaching a point of almost feeling tangible it is so vivid. This is of course helped by the truly creative and innovative camera work, representing the film's spirit of being way ahead of its time. Psycho is perhaps one of the most cleverly shot films in cinema history, which only amplifies the feeling of dread throughout, ably backed by Bernard Herrmann's chilling score.The film also boasts some rather spectacular acting, especially for its time period. Anthony Perkins is nothing less than superb in his infamous performance as the eccentric, socially awkward Norman Bates. Perkins creates a genuinely believable character, who is all the more unsettling and yet captivating by how strangely realistic as a real person he is. Janet Leigh also helps maintain the excellent tone for the movie with her iconic performance as on-the-run Marion Crane. Vera Miles also gives a strong performance as Lila, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam is great as the Detective searching for Marion.Psycho can be considered as nothing less than a classic, withstanding the test of time and coming off as just as masterfully made and honestly tense and frightening to this day. Fueled by excellent acting, and helmed by a master of the craft, Psycho is now one of those movies which would be considered almost essential viewing. Simply put, if you have yet to see this movie, don't continue to miss out!-10/10",Psycho
174,frankde-jong,A completely succeeded experiment by Hitchcock,8,26 July 2020,"In these days ""Psycho"" is the topfilm of Alfred Hitchcock. In IMDB this is his number 1 film in number of votes as well as in rates (26-07-2020).This has not always been the case. When he made the film ""Psycho"" was an experiment for Hitchcock. It was his switch from thriller to horror (the famous shower scene). Respected Hitchcock actors had a certain amount of reserve to become associated with this ""experiment"", and so the cast of ""Psycho"" contains lesser known and upcoming actors. For Anthony Perkins (playing Norman Bates) this chance was a ""curse in disguise"". He got never rid of his Norman Bates image.Apart from the cheaper actors the budget for ""Psycho"" was also in other respects more limited then previous Hitchcock movies. This was a deliberate choice. Hitchcock wanted the film to have an unpolished look.As usual Hitchcock has an unusual way to tell the story. The film begins with a theft of apparent main charachter Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). This theft is the reason Marion has to flee, but plays no role in the rest of the story. At around 1/3 of the film Marion is killed and the film has to find another main character.The experiment with Psycho succeeded completely and, as said in the beginning of this review, today ""Psycho"" is the top film of Hitchcock. In 1998 director Gus van Sant made an exact remake, image for image. At Universal studio's you can visit the set of ""Psycho"", which has become a tourist attraction.",Psycho

A square and mediocre yet beautiful woman falls in love and decides to take a risk. It is a desperate make or break attempt to escape her mundane life as a nine to five worker. But it is almost as if the whole world conspires to spoil her plans for a new life - right from the time her boss who sees her on the road as she is driving away, the nosy and sinister looking policeman, the gas station attendant and then of course ..... Norman Bates. The film then spins off into the hunt for the woman. I found the first half more compelling than the second. Bernard Herrman's score is used to great effect.

Some films should never be remade. I can see why Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory was remade. But why they had to remake Psycho, Halloween, The Omen, and others is just stupid. Psycho is a fantastic film that deserves the credit it has received. My favorite horror film is Halloween. But after that is probably Psycho or Jaws.

177,bobsgrock,Without serious rivals as the greatest thriller ever.,10,31 May 2009,"One of the most famous of all films, so much so that people who have never seen it know about the shower scene, or can quote, ""A boy's best friend is his mother."" Yet, Psycho is so much more than ""that scary movie with the shower scene."" In fact, it is not even a horror film by any stretch of the imagination; Hitchcock was too sophisticated for that. This is a mystery thriller, the first part being thriller and the second being mystery.One of the elements that make this a timeless piece of cinema is the way Hitchcock sets up the back story to the character of Marion Crane and the relationship between her and Norman Bates. From the moment these stories begin, we start to get involved without knowing that Hitchcock is toying with us. I cannot ruin any spoilers, since this is a film to enjoy the first time and then maybe a second time. But, it is important to know that even though this has influenced practically every horror movie since, it is nothing like any of them. Hitchcock shot in black and white to not appear gory and used old-school tricks like music and editing to create images in our mind much scarier than on the screen.Speaking of music, has there ever been a more perfect score written for a film since this masterful work by Bernard Herrmann? In every scene it is used, it underlies the drama and increases the suspense in a way no modern director could ever do with blood and grotesque imagery.The cast is wonderful, especially Janet Leigh as Marion and Anthony Perkins as Norman. As good as Leigh is in bringing us to her side, Perkins gives arguably one of the greatest performances in all of cinema. The little details, the stuttering, the twitching, the eyes moving all around go unnoticed the first few times. Then, after awhile you notice it and see that he almost completely makes us sympathize with this character. If you've seen this before, you know what an incredible job it is, although it is a shame Perkins never got out from under Bates' shadow. What is even worse is that they made three sequels to this movie, focusing more on Norman and the violence that I am sure ensued. Forget those attempts to capture your attention and be sure to view this masterpiece at least once. That's all it takes before you will look at your mother a little differently.",Psycho

181,TheUnknown837-1,"when a film can still shock and horrify an audience after nearly fifty years, it deserves to be remembered",10,4 July 2009,"The master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, is a director famous for a great many films. His movies and his passion for the crime of murder cemented into our collective consciousness images of terror and panic that even people who have never seen his movies can identify and pick out. Hitchcock made a stream of remarkable films over the course of his legendary career including the thrill ride ""Rear Window"" (1954) and his ultimate psychological masterpiece ""Vertigo"" (1958), but the film everybody remembers and relates to when discussing Hitchcock is his notorious 1960 box office smash ""Psycho"" and the scene everybody remembers is the one that made many people, including one of its performers, Janet Leigh, think twice before taking a shower again.""Psycho"", adapted from a novel by Robert Bloch, is the classic story of a woman from Phoenix (Janet Leigh) who in order to marry her financially-stressed lover (John Gavin), embezzles $40,000 dollars from her employer's client and finds herself on the run, fearing and panicking every face that looks in her direction. During her flee more or less from her morals, she checks into a desolate motel run by a handsome but strange young man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). What follows is the film's infamous ""shower scene"" and a long chain of thrills, frights, and terrifying images that people, to this very day, never forget.A film can be viewed as a true work of art when it has the same effect on an audience as it did nearly half a decade again. It has been forty-nine years since ""Psycho"" was first released and to this day, it still terrifies and appalls people very much like it did in 1960. To some, such as Walt Disney himself, ""Psycho"" is just too much. It's really the ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991) of its day. But to those who can appreciate art and storytelling, this is a motion picture that simply cannot be refused repeated viewings.The pivotal performance of the film is, without a doubt, Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins. The acting by Perkins is so iconic and so creepy and so off-putting that he really set the standards for slasher villains and frightening characters. It is so ironic that an actor so harmless-looking, so timid-sounding as Perkins could, in an instant, turn himself into the image of a sick, bloodthirsty psychopathic monster. He can become creepy without apparently even making an effort, as though he were in real life as deranged as his character. Perkins' Norman Bates is like the Charles Foster Kane of horror movies. He's been mimicked, but never matched or overpowered. The only real contender for a match is Hannibal Lecter by Anthony Hopkins. Whoever is creepier is up to you, but it's nevertheless a very close match.""Psycho"" is not a film that is about character development, but it doesn't need to be. In fact, extreme character development would get in the way. Norman Bates is strongly developed, but the other characters are established exceedingly well and then play from that point on. Janet Leigh, in particular, who takes up the first third of the movie almost entirely by herself, gives a great performance even though her character is very simple. Hitchcock used Leigh as a personification of the human fears and sins: guilt, panic, fear, envy, and lust. The film also features a well-cast Martin Balsam as a private investigator who tends to, like Hitchcock felt about some of his producers, get in the way too often without understanding fully what or whom he's dealing with.And of course, we can't leave out the thrills of the movie. Hitchcock used his techniques of shock, horror, and suspense to their fullest in this film. He uses the two main horror procedures: alerting an audience of an impending threat without telling the character or simply having the scare jump out and ""render you speechless"" as some of the ads for ""Psycho"" claimed the movie would do. And there is certainly more than just the infamous shower scene. It's not just the brutal killings. Again, there's Anthony Perkins in the landmark role of his career, and the black-and-white photography is notably far more effective than if Hitchcock had decided to shoot the movie in color (look at the dismal 1998 shot-by-shot remake for proof) and of course there's Bernard Herrmann's iconic all-string music score that rivets and lunges out at you.Although it is an intensely frightening film and ends with one of the creepiest final lines of all time, ""Psycho"" is so much more than just a horror story. Apart from the dawn of the slasher genre and a montage of spine-tingling images, it is a work of art done by one of the true geniuses of the cinema: Alfred Hitchcock. And while I don't feel this is his all-time best motion picture, it's certainly his most famous and deservedly so. When a film can shock and terrify an audience nearly fifty years since it was first released and tags an excellent story along with it, it deserves to be remembered.",Psycho
182,baumer,The grand daddy of them all,9,27 December 1999,"I love horror films. I have reviewed all the Fridays, all the Jaws', most of the Halloweens and a few of the Nightmares. Halloween and Jaws are, to me, the two best horror films ever made. And even though I don't think Psycho is on par with some of the best horror films ever to grace our screens, you have to give credit where credit is due. Psycho is a pioneer for horror films and it is because of Psycho that we have films like Halloween and Friday the 13th and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and directors like Hooper and Carpenter and Craven. I was born 12 years after Psycho was made and I really didn't get into film until at least another 10 years after that, but I can tell you that Psycho must have shocked and revolutionized film. Could you imagine a film maker so bold as to tell theater owners that they are not to permit anyone into the theater after it starts? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill the main character half way through the film? Can you imagine a film so bold as to kill someone so graphically in the shower? Sure you can imagine all that. It's 1999. This film is almost 40 years old. But imagine what it did to audiences in 1960. It must have shocked the hell out of everyone back then. Psycho is a film like no other.There have been films that have done it better than Psycho but none of them can say they were the first. Psycho is a great film and it is enjoyable, unlike other older films like Citizen Kane that are only listed as great because they were the first to do something but has nothing redeemable about it. Psycho is a creepy film and it gave birth to a genre and I am thankful for it because my favourite horror film has Psycho to thank for it's inspiration. Halloween uses the camera the same way Psycho did and Carpenter is a carbon copy of Hitchcock for this one film. The two films even share a common name and character, Sam Loomis. There really isn't anything else that I want to say about the film, there are more than 100 reviews in here and many of them are by people that know a hell a lot more about the film than I do, but I just wanted to say how thankful I am that a movie like Psycho came along and paved the way for future films like The Evil Dead and Last House On The Left and such. This may be the first twisted horror film of it's kind and that is worth mentioning.If you want to know how horror has revolutionized and evolved to the way it is today, you can look no further than Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant masterpiece, PSYCHO.",Psycho
183,brchthethird,"""A boy's best friend is his mother.""",9,11 August 2015,"SPOILER ALERT: Norman Bates committed the murders. PSYCHO has been around for over 50 years, and if you haven't seen it by now it's your own fault. Of course, it's been several years since I first saw it and, going through a Hitchcock marathon, I thought it would be an appropriate time to revisit it. My only memories of seeing it the first time are wondering what the big deal was. However, now having seen many films since then (including several more Hitchcock pictures), it seems even better to me the second time around. This is in large part thanks to the Bernard Herrmann's score, which punctuates all the right moments and backs off when necessary. The first thing other than the main theme that people will probably think of is the celebrated shower scene, but this time the moments where the score takes a back seat, or goes away entirely, stood out more. In particular, the scene where Norman and Marion have dinner in his parlor came off as extremely creepy, and the way in which Norman's demeanor changes within that scene was nothing short of amazing. Also, in contrast to NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO has a rear-projected driving scene which actually worked for me. Again, a lot of this has to do with the score, but Janet Leigh's facial expressions and reactions to what goes on around her helped just as much to make it work. What also makes this film stand out from a lot of Hitchcock's other pictures was the conscious artistic choice to shoot in black and white. Although he said it would have been too gory to shoot in color, it gives the film a distinct griminess that stands in contrast to the high glamour of his other work. PSYCHO is decidedly unglamorous, and it succeeds because it fits with the subject matter. Lastly, Hitchcock is notorious for playing with audience expectations, and PSYCHO contains perhaps his greatest cinematic joke: the (apparent heroine) is killed off nearly halfway in to the film. Now her death does provide the dramatic momentum for the rest of it, but I can only imagine how audiences 1960 would have been shocked by this twist. In terms of his overall corpus (at least what I've seen so far), I'd put it up there with REAR WINDOW and NORTH BY NORTHWEST just shy of VERTIGO. The only thing that brings it down a peg is some needless psychoanalysis in the last scene. For me, it would have been more powerful to cut most of that out and skip to the chilling final shot that gradually zooms in on Anthony Perkins' face. Still, even with that scene, PSYCHO is definitely one of Hitchcock's finest, and laid the groundwork for the next generation of horror films.",Psycho
184,IonicBreezeMachine,"An important film not just as a watershed moment, but for its brutal and psychological approach to the thriller genre that endures to this day",9,4 July 2021,"When Marion Crane (Janey Leigh) sees an opportunity to steal $40,000 so she can free her boyfriend, Sam (John Gavin), of his debts so they can finally be married Marion takes the opportunity and rushes to California to meet him. Thoughts of paranoia, panic, and guilt haunt Marion as she travels the isolated interstate roads in a near constant state of tension and unease. When she's forced by bad weather to stop for the night at the isolated Bates Motel, she meets the manager, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a soft spoken, timid, but seemingly well meaning man who sets her up for the night unaware of the terror that awaits her at the hands of Norman's mother.Released in 1960 to polarizing reviews but massive audience approval and huge box office, Psycho has become a pop culture touchstone with music, characters, story beats, and iconography routinely referenced, homage, and parodied. Based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch the books premise of creating sympathetic characters only to kill them off in situations that resembled Ed Gein spoke to Hitchcock who fought tooth and nail to get the film made against the wishes of executives who found the premise too lurid and tasteless. Using his TV crew from the TV show Alfred Hitchcock Presents and banking more on his prestige than resources to draw names the film was nothing short of a miracle to get off the ground with resistance from both executives and censors who were irked by the film's brazen disregard for production code guidelines. The movie against the expectations of all Hitchcock's naysayers created a haunting psychological thriller with a sense of style and dread that uses limited resources to great effect.With Psycho there's so many elements that come together it's hard to pick out just one, from Bernard Herrmann's iconic string heavy musical score that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats in states of tension that are the only respite from creeping terror, to the cinematography by John L. Russell that perfectly frames the shots from the most iconic to the seemingly inconsequential this is maximum effect with minimum resources. The flourishes are well done, but they'd be ultimately meaningless without a solid story to back them up. Hitchcock creates intriguing characters and atmosphere from the get go with desperate stakes motivating instigating actions and brining relatability to the characters so we care about what's going on. Anthony Perkins is the central point of Psycho in Norman Bates and his performance is pitch perfect with his mannerisms, delivery, and body language conveying a story in and of itself. From Norman's meek politeness, to his discomfort with his own sexuality, and hair trigger temper Perkins hits all the right notes to make Norman both tragic and threatening.Psycho is an important film not just for pushing the boundaries of sex and violence but also in unconventional storytelling and audience misdirection. With a storyline that isn't afraid to yank the rug out from the audiences feet to scenes that are designed to make the audience uncomfortable, psycho understands how to get under its audience's skin and take them to the darkest recesses of humanity.",Psycho

186,telegonus,It's the Little Things,10,5 September 2001,"So much has been written about this film that all I can do is add my own voice of approval and say that I consider it to be a masterpiece, and add a few things often overlooked or not commented on that add so much to the movie's cumulative power. It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, ""I'm in no mood for trouble"", to the final ""hey!"" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (""Sometimes just once is enough"", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, ""periwinkle blue""). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, ""Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary"".f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.
In conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.",Psycho
187,hnt_dnl,One of the top 5 films of all time!,10,31 May 2008,"The irony of the film PSYCHO for me is that while I wasn't born when it came out in 1960 and didn't get to see it until some 20 years after its release, I actually DIDN'T know anything that happened in it when I first saw it! So the shock, awe, and surprise for me was the firsthand reactions of someone who had never seen or known anything about the film. Of course, that was back in an age where there was no internet, very few channels to watch on TV, and spoilers weren't put out forever and a day. I was lucky. I hope anyone who hasn't seen film and enjoys films is as lucky as I was.You know the story: THE GREATEST MACGUFFIN EVER TOLD! The great Alfred Hitchcock totally fools us into thinking that this masterwork is about retrieving a stolen $40,000 when in fact it is about SOOOOO much more than that! Marion Crane (played by the great Janet Leigh in a complex, sexy, heartbreaking performance) steals the money from her boss, an insurance agent, then 'steals' off (pun intended) 'into the night' (actually it was daytime) with the money. Along the way she has thoughts of various conflicting thoughts and emotions of the results of her actions and ends up at the Bates Motel.Ahh, the Bates Motel! The most famous location in all of film history! Marion meets the proprietor and manager Norman Bates (played by none other than Anthony Perkins in one of the most stunning, sterling, fascinating, perfect performances in film history). Norman is the mama's boy to end all mamas boys! The parlor conversation between Norman and Marion has got to be, to this day, one of the most fascinating talks between two lost souls ever put to screen. The angular way that Hitchcock shot it adds to its brilliance. The albeit too brief 'relationship' between Norman and Marion is never talked about enough for me: it's obvious that her sexuality intimidates him and is rather off-putting. And you can tell that she finds his sweetness and vulnerability a refreshing change from the big city jerks that she is used to. Two great performances, both of which should have won Oscars. Leigh was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and the fact that Perkins wasn't nominated for Best Actor may be the all time biggest oversight in Oscar history.PSYCHO is fascinating on so many levels and gets a lot about human nature right: the aforementioned sexuality that lies within all of us, the different levels of guilt that all humans possess (virtually every character in this film is guilty of SOMETHING), the ways that men objectify women, and fact that all of us at heart are shaped by our parents, whether we'd want to admit it or not.This is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film accomplishment for me, and that says a lot because he is my favorite director of all time. He got nominated for Best Director (the Academy got that part right), but didn't win (Academy got this one wrong). And PSYCHO is in the top 5 films of all time for me also. It is a landmark that ironically inspired thousands (maybe millions) knock-offs about psychotic mama-boy serial killers. But this is the film with the real heart and soul. No remakes, retreads, or sequels necessary.",Psycho

189,marcin_kukuczka,Superior Thriller of Mind about Mastermind,9,16 November 2008,"If buffs of ambitious movies search timeless horrors, they usually encounter PSYCHO by Alfred Hitchcock, the movie that, in a way, has become a sort of cult movie watched all over again in various places on earth. Yet, such movies usually lead us to a dilemma of high expectations and the subjective reactions after first viewing.When I decided to see PSYCHO for the first time, I was surprised with one feature that from the very beginning and throughout the whole movie caught my attention: intellectual authenticity. That concerns all aspects from performances to soundtrack and script. Since PSYCHO by master director Alfred Hitchcock was released almost 50 years ago and has already ""experienced"" the test of time, we could well expect this movie to occur dated due to its black and white nature and allegedly old fashioned acting. However, what appears to all viewers is just the opposite. The movie still impresses as a clever story, still shocks as a horror, still stuns with its cinematography and soundtrack as a work of art.Who can possibly ignore the flawless thrill in various moments of the film that remain in memory for long, moments of stunning cinematography, marvelous lighting that make black and white more attractive than lots of top visual effects? Except for the famous shower-murder scene that combines gore with sexuality and thrill with empathy, there are really breathtaking moments that lead the viewer to the extent of ""orgasmic"" trance of mind. Consider for instance, Marion (Janet Leigh) driving a car and her thoughts of various sorts. Another moment worth attention is Marion - Norman conversation...someone would perhaps ask ""what's brilliant about it?"" Everything! It is simply the moment of mental power that I have hardly found elsewhere, you, as if (of course illusively) get into the mind and perception of this man, into his peculiar hobby, into his very island of ""divided"" self. The shot of Norman's house with cloudy sky in the background makes an enormous effect. And here, it's a must to mention the marvelous scene of Lilah (Vera Miles), Marion's sister approaching the house... How wonderfully filmed, what a soundtrack, what a power of illusion and bliss of thrill! Nowadays, one can only imagine how innovative and convincing the film must have been in 1960...The performances in the film are sublime. I find all of the acting remarkable but if I were to choose the three most memorable ones, I'd say: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles/Janet Leigh and Martin Balsam. I know that this choice may seem inaccurate to some readers but that is my personal opinion. Perkins gives a masterwork of performance embodying a character of true psychological contradictions that we find later, as we get to know him better. Naturally, psychology is hidden, innate and far from being discovered as easily as looks. Perkins had a very difficult task in this film, some of the hardest ones ever, but he crafted it perfectly, including his final scene... Perhaps you wonder why I have combined Vera Miles and Janet Leigh together but it was done deliberately. The two portray sisters and occur to me as true sisters of the same authentic depiction of fear, of curiosity, of sexual appeal. There could not be a better choice for these roles than the two. Finally, Martin Balsam as private detective Arbogast is brilliant focusing on strong personality ready to cope with suspicion and terror. His scene with Norman is unforgettable with this truly accurate wordiness of investigation.But I feel that the gist of why PSYCHO was such a blockbuster and has been popular for all these years is neither its artistic side including performances, cinematography, soundtrack, nor even the direction. Its key of success lies in the fact that it is a horror of a psyche set partly within the psyche. It is not a series of shocking scenes with monsters, ghosts or imaginary creatures but the film rooted in the very riddle of human mind, distorted as it may seem yet pretty universal. The scenes we get near the end of the film, perhaps seem hardly real as if not of this world but after longer inspection, it appears they all make a perfect sense. Therefore, the reason for its authenticity is foremost the movie's psychological aspect memorably presented. Strange numbers add to the mystery of all and the atmosphere works for the rest.All in all, PSYCHO is an unforgettable film, a pearl in the genre and a true model for many modern thrillers that turn either to kitsch or to cheap entertainment. Hitchcock's film is an example of how cinema can entertain, shock, provoke and also educate a bit. If you're looking for your island of escape from decadent and meaningless effects in modern horrors, go to something original and see PSYCHO, a superior thriller of mind.",Psycho
190,sharky_55,We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you?,10,20 April 2016,"It's funny to see so many reviews of this classic marked for spoilers because the shower murder scene of Marion Crane is perhaps the most prominent example of film being embedded into the cultural psyche - and then parodied and mimicked so much that it birthed an entire new genre. It is Hitchcock's greatest use of montage - each cut as an assault on the audience's senses, each as another slash of the knife to Crane's dripping, screaming face. Eisenstein's theory means we do not actually see knife ever puncture flesh, but the separate images creates a merged meaning. And would it be half as iconic without Bernard Herrmann's contribution? The screeching strings are built up apprehensively before the pivotal scene, and when they finally match up with the knife, it slips in seamlessly with each slash, each cut, and it is frantic, horrifying. Hitchcock made history by killing her sensuous lead star less than halfway into his movie, but his mastery is shown in how effortlessly he moves our sympathies from the blonde to Norman Bates (actually they are not so different; compare the last, wicked smile with the furrow of the brow and the sneaking grin of Leigh in the exchanged car, as night's darkness descends on her but the light illuminates her face all the same - and those mischievous eyebrows!). We are continually shown the cop in the distance, a latent anxiety that makes the car swap all for naught. And we expect this to pan out somehow. This anxiety becomes Norman's as he discovers the murder - quickly, briefly, absentmindedly, as if he was just changing the sheets, he cleans up the mess. He puts on his boyish, gangly persona back on, and we pause as he does, hoping too the car will resume bubbling and sinking. And as his social facade is shaken by probing questions, we rally for him to regain his confidence and wish the detective away. Perkins is at the film's centre, with a brilliant, brilliant performance. With each rewatch it becomes a game to note his marked switches of his persona, his adoption of the psychopath's empty chuckle and stare. The social skills breakdowns are subtle; just a tiny pause, an awkward question, but not enough to make Crane too apprehensive. His wary eyes darting around just ever so slightly. His 'hobby' of taxidermy treads on the line between normal and deranged, but it is not until later do we recognise the sexual motif of the birds (his mother being his first stuffed corpse) and the way Perkin's body language uncannily points towards his internal psychological delusion. As if we did not receive the message clearly, Hitchcock superimposes a skull onto that final, chilling stare. Hitchcock also went to great lengths to hide his mystery whilst not compromising his visuals. The shadow behind the shower curtain and illuminating only the feminine wig. The bird's eye view of Arbogast's demise, complete with rear projection effect so it feels like he is falling into the stairs (not dissimilar to Hitchcock's own dolly zoom). The female silhouette high up in the Bates second-story window (it is not so far-fetched to imagine Norman propping up his late mother and having conversations with her). In one instance, the lazy-eye of the sheriff seems to address the audience itself and ask: ""Who then is that woman buried in the Bates grave?"" I have come to accept the final psychiatrist's explanation as a necessary evil; it was a different time, as evident by Hitchcock's promos which forbid late entrants to theatre showings. Would a modern viewer ever entertain the idea of walking in halfway through a film only to realise the star had already been killed off? But Hitchcock set a precedent; no doubt viewers were all thoroughly confused to find Leigh bubbling under the swamp, but it only piqued their curiosity, their determination to unravel the mystery of Psycho.",Psycho
191,vip_ebriega,"""A boy's best friend is his mother.""",10,6 November 2009,"My Take: A landmark thriller from the one and only Alfred Hitchcock.Familiar even to anyone who hasn't seen the film itself, from its famous sequence that has been imitated and parodied several times to its undeniable influence in the horror genre, Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO has since become a part of cinematic history. But with such influence it has made, you'd think the genuine article has lost its touch. That ain't so. Seeing PSYCHO today, the classic still retains its ability to shock on a first time viewing and to give you the creeps even if you've seen it twice or more times.We all know its influence in the several generations of slasher movies, but what still places PSYCHO is that it's less like the horror films it inspired than another thriller masterwork from Alfred Hitchcock; it's a well-crafted and intelligently written thriller, a quality that has slowly lessened in many of the slashers that have followed. Who could forget Janet Leigh in her performance that would make her famous in horror filmdom (and earn her an Oscar nomination) as the doomed Marion Crane. But any conversation about PSYCHO wouldn't be complete without the mention of Anthony Perkins superb performance as the infamous Norman Bates, a slightly maladjusted owner of the desolate Bates Motel. Perhaps the guys at the Oscar's were simply shocked and shivered by his chilling portrayal to give him the Oscar nomination he most certainly deserved. The supporting performances, especially by Vera Miles, are strong enough to carry the rest of the picture.Everything seemed to be pitch perfect about PSYCHO: As usual, Bernard Herrmann teams with Hitch and provides a chilling score that will forever etched in our memories. The infamous shower scene, while no longer as shocking, is still one of the most expertly crafted sequence ever made; it's use of montage is still being scrutinized and studied by any film student today. George Milo, Robert Clatworth and Joseph Hurley's art direction is superb, from Norman's office parlor inhabited by stuffed birds to the famous Bates residence (complete with a silhouette of Mother in the window) is legendary and relevant to the many goings-on at the mysterious Bates Motel. The black-and-white photography does more than just make the censor approve the film, it also suites the film's ample atmosphere (blood in B&W is creepier than color). All this and so much more (not to mention the first-ever on-screen flushing of the toilet) make PSYCHO the father (or is that Mother) of them all.Rating: ***** out of 5.",Psycho
192,one9eighty,An absolute master-class in film,10,5 April 2016,"An absolute classic, if you haven't seen this yet you must have been living under a rock Shame on you for not watching it and make a note to immediately get a copy and watch it. What can I say that hasn't already been said about this film? I could tell you that Janet Leigh only ever took baths after watching the famous shower scene played out on a big screen and realising how vulnerable women in showers were. I could tell you that liquid chocolate was used for blood to make it look more authentic in black and white in the film. I could tell you that Hitchcock decided to film in black and white on purpose because he wanted to keep the costs down and also because he was fed up with the star studded glossy films of the time. I could even tell you that Bernard Herrmann's musical score inspired Hitchcock to double the fee Herrmann was receiving, especially after seeing and hearing the shower scene which Hitchcock had originally intended to be silent. This film has been talked about, written about, studied and idolised to death - but deservedly so, so lets not look at trivia and facts and progress with this review. Psycho is a departure from the standard horror movies of the time which generally had physical monsters in them. This film looked more at the human psyche and how much of a horror your average Joe Anybody could be - and believe me Anthony Perkins does a fine job on delivering that. The film helped to break a lot of stereotypes which Hollywood had in place and with it's perfectly emotional delivery the films is an absolute master-class on how to make something out of seemingly very little.This is arguably Hitchcock's finest film and plays on many emotions through sight, sound and feel. An amazing cast of stars bring the characters to life, the setting is authentic and feels right and the musical score (Bernard Herrmann) is just as famous as the film itself, both rely heavily on each other to deliver perfection but it could equally be said that they would be brilliant standing alone too. Although I wasn't around during the 60's and 70's I have been led to believe that this film is as authentic as it comes for summing up the era and this is absolutely down to Hitchcock vision. If you sit down having not seen this before you could mistakenly think this is a robbery/heist based film with the leading lady, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) on the run from her employer for stealing $40k. Although stealing is bad Marion being the central lead assumes the role of heroine and the audience are almost encouraged to root for her. As it turns out the money is not that important and soon takes a back seat to the plot - albeit the other characters looking for Marion are motivated in part by the desire to find the money and clear or validate the accusation Marion is facing. Up until arriving at the Bates motel you are only fed snippets of information about Marion, any time you get close to discovering more about her via the other characters, they are soon met with a dead end. Norman Bates (Perkins) seems to manage to delve the deepest into Marion but what he finds out isn't happy news to his mothers ears. I'm not going to delve too much into the plot of the rest of the film in case you haven't seen it - the last thing I wasn't to do is spoil the ending (if you are one of a few people who haven't actually seen this). What I will say is watch this and enjoy, it's a good old fashioned horror film which has embedded itself in pop culture and the halls of film legend due to it's depth, charm and it's absolute quality.",Psycho
193,gftbiloxi,"Room Service, Please",10,1 April 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock guarded the plot of PSYCHO against publicity, and in 1960 audiences came to the film without being able to anticipate the unexpected twists and turns of the plot. More than forty years later, the movie's fame is such that even those who have not seen it are often able to sketch the basic outline of the story in a few words. This demonstrates the film's fame; what demonstrates it quality, however, is the fact that even those who know the plot before seeing it are seldom disappointed.Very loosely based on Robert Bloch's pulp novel, which was itself very loosely based on killer Ed Gein, PSYCHO presents us with the tale of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)--who, in a moment of madness, steals forty-thousand dollars. Running scared, Marion checks into the out-of-the-way Bates Motel. And there, as production notes for the recent DVD release gracefully state, she becomes the most grossly inconvenienced hotel guest in cinema history.The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a deluge of low budget and badly made films that commanded box office business via tawdry subject matter, and according to lore director Alfred Hitchcock was curious to see what might happen if he himself made such a film--but made it well. Working with a remarkable script and gifted cast and crew, the result was a masterpiece. Although it is often described as a horror film, PSYCHO is less horror than it is a study in paranoia and suspense, and certainly a lesson in the fact that one need not bother with graphic gore or big budgets to impress audiences.Much of the film's success is in its detail. Joseph Stephano's script is memorable for its repetition of verbal motifs and its extremely disquieting tone; Bernard Herrman's famous all-strings score builds tremendously upon it. The simple yet meticulous sets communicate building unease, and the strangely flat, semi-documentary black and white cinematography has a voyeuristic edge that is extremely disturbing.There are elements that can be justly criticized--moments at which the script sounds a false note or characterizations seem a bit artificial--but these small points fade against the overall power of Hitchcock's vision, a vision that here makes viewers squirm even when there seems nothing tangible on screen to squirm about. But in the end, this is the film for which Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin will forever be remembered... and one of the several films that will forever be associated with one of the twentieth century's most masterful directors.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer",Psycho
194,jhclues,Nobody Does It Better Than Hitchcock,10,21 January 2001,"Throughout his long and illustrious career, director Alfred Hitchcock thrilled and captivated audiences everywhere, but never before or since as well as he did with the psychological chiller, `Psycho,' which introduced the cinematic world to a guy named Norman Bates.  And now-- forty years later-- even in an age of jaded, desensitized sensibilities, graphic horror and the likes of Hannibal Lecter and `American Psycho,' Hitchcock's masterpiece remains, even after repeated viewings, truly frightening and intrinsically disturbing.  Just as Ingmar Bergman did with his character of Karin in his landmark film, `Through A Glass, Darkly,' Hitchcock presents a character (Bates) at the psychological crossroads of his life, a pivotal juncture wherein he is required to make a conscious decision that will determine the course of the rest of his life:  Whether to reach for the light (and healing), or succumb to the voices beckoning to him from the dark, a place from which there will be no return.  Norman, however--like karin-- is incapable of making that decision, and ultimately must adhere to the resolution of the subconscious, which takes him past the point of no return and subsequently beyond the reach of any help forevermore.  The rest of the characters in the story-- Marion Crane, Lila, Sam Loomis, Arbogast-- are all mere pawns who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are forced by fate to help play out the drama of Norman's twisted existence. 	Janet Leigh gives a memorable performance as Marion, creating a character that was not only destined to go down in cinematic history, but one that would make women everywhere afraid to shower at a motel.  Vera Miles is effective as Marion's sister, Lila, and John Gavin gives credibility to Marion's lover, Sam Loomis.  Martin Balsam gives a solid performance as well, as Arbogast, the ill-fated Private Eye whose encounter with Norman's mother on the stairs is a scene nearly as famous as that of Marion's `shower.'   But the real star of the film is, of course, Anthony Perkins, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Norman Bates, a character even more chilling than Hannibal Lecter, in that his outward appearance is so deceiving, so contrary to the evil dwelling behind his unintended facade of normalcy.  His gentle countenance and boyish charm are so `real' that after being exposed to him it forever after makes anyone and everyone you encounter in your own life suspect.  And Perkins plays him to perfection, in arguably the best (and definitely the most memorable) performance of his career. 	The supporting cast includes John McIntire (Sheriff Chambers), Simon Oakland (Dr. Richmond), Vaughn Taylor (George Lowery), Frank Albertson (Tom Cassidy), Lurene Tuttle (Mrs. Chambers), Patricia Hitchcock (Caroline), John Anderson (Charlie) and Mort Mills (Highway Patrolman).  If there was any doubt by the time this film was made, `Psycho' once and for all proved that Hitchcock was, indeed, the Master of Suspense.  There have been many imitators before and since, but all of them, good and bad alike, only serve to point out that nobody does it better than Hitchcock.  I rate this one 10/10.",Psycho
195,johno-21,Norman Bates: an unassuming hotelier who wouldn't hurt a fly,9,20 June 2006,"This was the fifth and final film of Alfred Hitchcocks impressive directorial career to earn him an Academy Award nomination for best director. His other nominated films as a director were Rear window, spellbound, Life Boat and Rebecca. He never won the Oscar. This time around he lost out to Billy Wilder for The Apartment. What he accomplished from this innovative low budget film probably should have won him the Oscar. This is a low budget film for Hitchcock that in toady;s dollars would have cost about $5 million to make. The film was adapted from the 1959 lackluster novel by Robert Bloch by screenwriter Joseph Stefano. Cinematographer Jack Russell got an Academy Award nomination for photographing this film but no major film offers because of his work, He had did Orson Welles' Macbethe early in his career and was mostly involved in television and a few B movies before and after Psycho. He does a great job here along with film editor George Tomasini who edited Stalag 17, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Birds and Cape Fear among his many fine films. A memorable music score from Bernard Herrman who did such films as Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Vertigo and The Man Who Knew Too Much. This is the story of a woman who steals $40,000 dollars and has plans to run away with her married lover but sees her plans and the life she lived evaporate so on the run she stops at a rundown motel off the beaten path that sits in the shadow of an old decapitated wooden turn-of-the-century mansion where the motel keeper lives with his aged mother. It's a classic horror setting and filmed in black and white. Janet Leigh in an Academy award nominated performance as Best Supporting Actress is the woman on the run and Anthony Perkins is the motel keeper who has been hounded by his domineering mother all his life and functions in his lonely existence as a motel keeper of a motel that no one stops at anymore. Also among the cast are Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Gavin and John McIntire. This film also received an Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction for it's great set. It's a fairly simple story with twists and turns and a little black comedy thrown in. It's a classic and comes across as kind of a bonus prize for followers of Hitchcock like he was saying here's something a little different for you to check out. I would give it a 9.0 out of 10.",Psycho
196,educallejero,Questionable ending of an amazing thriller,10,21 November 2019,"I would normally discount some points for the sudden conclusion and unnecessary exposition, but considering that it was 1960, maybe it was neccesary.Besides that, the incredible performances from Vera Miles and Anthony Perkins brought to life such a duo of complex and superb characters, with the use of the highest level of acting, including complete body and facial expressions, helped by a great and natural dialogue that made the intriguing plot to grow in tension with every minute, flowing with total harmony right until the last couple of scenes.",Psycho
197,Stampsfightclub,Psycho is a refreshing example of true horror and intensity,9,10 May 2009,"Marion Crane (Leigh) runs away from her job and life with a huge amount of money at her disposal when she stops at the Bates hotel and meets troubled Norman (Perkins) When exploring the most successful horror films of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho will more than likely crop up amongst others including Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Nightmare on Elm Street or Scream. There have been many changes to the genre over the last couple of decades, perhaps the most significant when the genre went digital with the psychologically frightening Blair Witch Project. But as times grow many horrors are spurned with little effect on the viewers who expect someone hiding with typical music and degrading stereotypes, for example The Hole.Psycho, released in the early 1960's, may have lost an edge in sharpness with technology inevitability taking control over scares but the shock and drama encoded remain intact and is still a favourite amongst horror fanatics and the shower scene is still debated as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best.Starting off Psycho sets Janet Leigh and John Gavin debating their future and soon Leigh has money and sets off on her own. This act of selfishness and greed brings viewers right up to scratch as her angelic image is far from her devilish actions and we soon have a thriller on our hands. And soon we also have Anthony Perkins to contend with.Perkins brings a sharp and twisted shock to the story with a disturbing portrayal of a lonely man wanting company and as we see his stalkerish obsession mixed with his bizarre hobby we dive right into the infamous scene and the shock will surprise and entertain you with a swirling and dramatic depiction of the consequences by Hitchcock.Again the English director shows a sharp intensity in story telling with fast moving montages and a clever use of bird eye view angles to capture the shocking story in its full intensity.This horror drama has one of the finest musical scores I personally have ever heard for such a genre. The opening sharp cut title sequences and credits role with a finely established mixture of sophistication and sharpness that generates a feeling of excitement and tension to set you up for the film.As far as horror films go these days you will see a helpless stereotype waiting for the inevitable to happen. Therefore it is refreshing to know that some classic horrors will still shock and surprise and Psycho is at the top of that list.",Psycho
198,khanbaliq2,Psycho is still frightening after all these years.,10,5 February 2010,"Psycho is probably the most visual, most cinematic picture director Alfred Hitchcock has ever made. At a lonely motel, vicious murders take place and are attributed to the manic mother of the young owner.The film is a curious shocker devised by Hitchcock as a tease and initially received by most critics as an unpleasant horror piece in which the main scene, the shower stabbing, was allegedly directed not by Hitchcock but by Saul Bass. After enormous commercial success it achieved classic status over the years; despite effective moments of fright, it has a childish plot and script, yet it remains a hugely successful confidence trick, made for very little money by a TV crew. Psycho spawned two sequels, a prequel, a remake, and an unsuccessful television spin-off.",Psycho
199,jluis1984,The Master shows how to make a film,10,14 December 2005,"According to history, at the end of the 50s Hitchcock saw that many low-budget films were gaining many audience; knowing the flaws in those films, he decided to try to make a low-budget film and see what happened when in his words ""an experienced director"" does a low budget film. The result was ""Psycho"".Loosely based on Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, ""Psycho"" is a superbly done film in almost every aspect, and shows the perfection of Hitchcock's technique. The Master was at that time at the peak of his art.Scripwriter Joseph Stefano makes a different take on Bloch's novel and tells the story of Marion Crane, a woman who in an impulsive act steals $40 thousand dollars from her boss; in her escape, she spends the night at the Bates Motel, only to discover the dark secret that hides the owners, Norman Bates and his mother.Done with a budget of $800,000, ""Psycho"" is perfectly conceived as it never goes too far from what it pretends to do. Hitchcock worked closely to Stefano in order to know exactly what type of take he was going to do.Filmed in Black and White in a time when color was already the dominant format, the sharp contrast between light and darkness is a beautiful remark of what lies hidden inside Bates Motel.Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, Marion and Norman respectively, give an outstanding performance in their roles. Perkins clearly dominates the character of Norman and it is obvious why was he type-casted as Bates, his performance and the character is so well developed by the script that is impossible to not feel empathy for him.Many words could be written about Psycho, but all that must be said is that this film shows what film-making is about. The perfect mixture of art and entertainment. Now, after many parodies, homages and sequels, the movie still retains its power and it is definitely, one of the movies every person in the world should see at least once. 10/10. Masterpiece.",Psycho

Psycho is 1 of the early forms of erotica with Janet's sultry, vivacious body of work here again, all praise be to Janet Leigh, Jamie Lee's mom! 1 of the great black and white movies of the time thanks to it being made in 1960! 1 of the great story concepts ever for a film! 1 of the scariest films ever shown. The BEST murder mystery ever told. The GREATEST spookiest serial killer portrayal ever seen all thanks to Norman Bates, I mean Anthony Perkins, and it probably always will be because I just watched Split the other day and trust me James McAvoy does not even compare even though I love Anya Taylor-Joy! 1 of the great horror villains ever thanks to Norman Bates and his crazy momma, and lastly and most incredibly and world renown, 1 of the most memorable, unexpected and most potent, shocking scenes ever seen in a film (let alone shower scenes) with the peephole and the gorgeous Janet Leigh and the shower curtain and the shower head and the knife and the wig and the robe and the blood and the water and the drain.

202,bankofmarquis,Perkins performance belongs with the All-Time great performances,9,29 October 2018,"I'm sure all of you have (at least) heard of the 1960 Alfred Hitchcock film, PSYCHO. And I'm sure most of you have seen (at least in part) the famous ""shower scene"". But when was the last time you really sat down and watched this film? It had been awhile for me and I walked away with the following impression:PSYCHO is not all that scary, but it is suspenseful as heck with strong Direction by the ""Master of Suspense"" and very strong performances anchoring the front and back end of the film.PSYCHO was billed when it came out as a ""Janet Leigh Film"". So, to give this review context, let's look at who Janet Leigh was at the time. Before shooting PSYCHO, Leigh was generally cast as the ingenue and/or love interest in mainstream fair such as LITTLE WOMEN, ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD and HOUDINI (a modern ""comp"" to her might be someone like Anne Hathaway before she started doing ""edgier"" work). Leigh did show that there was more to her than just being an ingenue when she played the morally ambiguous wife of Charlton Heston's character in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL. This film (probably) gave Hitchcock the idea to cast Leigh in PSYCHO.When 1960's audiences first saw Leigh on screen in PSYCHO, I'm sure that most of them were shocked for, instead of being the pure and wholesome ingenue and wife, she plays the entire first scene in a bra and slip. Her character, Marion Crane, is not morally ambiguous, she is morally corrupt - and when Leigh's character has a chance to act on her moral corruptness, she jumps at the chance. The rest of the first half of this film is Leigh trying to get away with her ""crime"". She is quite good in this part of the film and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (deservedly so).And then...Anthony Perkins shows up.We are about 45 minutes into the 1 hour and 49 minute film when Perkins' Norman Bates first appears on screen and an interesting thing happened - I couldn't take my eyes off of him. I was enjoying Leigh's performance but instantly pushed her aside (and to the background) when Perkins shows up. Without giving plot away, let me say that there is much, much going behind Norman's eyes and the performance by Perkins strongly suggests this, without going over-the-top or being melodramatic. It is a perfect blend of actor, character and performance and I was shocked that he was not even NOMINATED for an Oscar (Peter Ustinov would win for SPARTACUS). Perkins performance is one of the all-time greats with one of the most interesting and unusual characters - and portrayals - of all time.Much of the credit for Perkins' and Leigh's strong performances have to go to Director Hitchcock who was at the height of his Directing powers (and power). From the ""get go"", you can feel the Director's hand in this film, building suspense from scene to scene and shot to shot, first with Leigh's character and, later, with Perkins. Both characters are trying to get away with something and Hitchcock pulls his camera in close to make a point - from a distance all seems good, but when you get up close, you can tell that things are very bad, indeed.The filming of the famous ""shower scene"" is well documented and is a Master Class in film and editing. It is worth the price of admission on it's own - as is a scene on a staircase with Private Detective Arbogast, played by Martin Balsam. Hitchcock chooses to heighten the realism in this scene on the staircase by going a more esoteric route (rather than traditional filming of the events) and, one can argue, it doesn't belong in this film. Until, that is, you think about it and then it makes great sense and absolutely, positively has to be in this film in that way.Another aspect of this film that begs to be mentioned is the Film Score by the great Bernard Herrmann - Hitchcock's regular collaborator. The music in this film punctuates the action on the screen - from the persistent beat and pacing of the opening credits music - driving the audience forward into the action - that does not let go, reaching it's peak and crescendo in the shower scene and then floating down gently like an animal catching it's breath after great activity.Does the entire film hold up almost 60 years later? Almost...but not quite. Most annoying to me was the ""wrap-up"" scene at the end where a character spells out everything for the audience. As if we are not smart enough to ""get it"" - and perhaps the audiences in 1960 weren't.But that is a quibble for a film that is a classic and is one that, if you have not seen (or seen for awhile), begs to be seen. Check out this film, not for the scares, but rather, the suspense that is generated by Hitchcock and his performers throughout. A GREAT entree into the world of Alfred Hitchcock films.Letter Grade: A9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)",Psycho
203,Angry_Arguer,I'm not going to waste time writing this review,10,20 August 2003,"There are movies that require a lot of thinking as to why they are great, then there are movies that are great because they are multi-layered yet complex on each layer.Psycho is one such example.  Hitchcock is marvelous in his manipulation of both the audience and the picture.  To think this was robbed at the Oscar! Bernard Hermann, one of the greatest composers ever, proves his strength with total vigor.  It is all to obvious why Hitch kept relying on him.Simply put, this is required viewing to anyone.  If it makes you want to take a shower again (I doubt it will cause any phobias of that)...so be it. Nonetheless, an important film that isn't afraid to be detailed with some pretty deep and disturbing material.  I will take it over a billion Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street sequels any day, any time.  No one will be able to match Anthony Perkins' eccentric mannerisms, not in a thousand years.  Kudos to Hitch for casting him.Overall, if there was one flaw I felt with this movie, it was that the shrink at the end did to much explaining to the audience and didn't allow Hitch to create something on his own that would have done the same job more effectively.  4.5 out of 5 stars.",Psycho
204,aesgaard41,Grand-daddy Of All Slasher Movies,10,9 April 2001,"Not many people know it, but Robert Bloch loosely based his original novel on the story of Ed Gein, a farmer of Plainfield, Wisconsin who collected body parts from the cemetary and who killed two women. Almost too weird to be true, Bloch sensationalized the original story and created a top notch horror story which became a movie that started a whole new series of slasher and killer movies. Psycho is a masterpeice in direction, style, acting, writing, plot and execution. The story centers around that of a lovely, would-be female thief who absconds with a lot of money. The movies rotates around the movie's main character like a pin wheel before shooting in and absolving the story with a climax and one of the single most recognizable visuals in movie history. Anthony Perkins is a vulnerable but likeable maniac with a character, a far cry from his hockey masked and claw handed progeny. Janet Leigh proves how the shower is the most vulnerable spot for a person to be, and Martin Balsam creates a believable detective far from the trench coat gumshoes in the old nickel and dime stories. Spoofing the role later in the flick, Silence of the Hams, he proved just how far this movie has seeped into the consciousness of movie-goers.",Psycho

206,itamarscomix,She couldn't even hurt a fly,10,6 July 2006,"Psycho remains the greatest thriller ever made. I consider it Alfred Hitchcock's last great film (apologies to all Birds lovers out there  I'm sorry, but in Hitchcock's standards that movie really was mediocre at best) as well as the best he had made, and the one in which the efforts of terrific films like Rear Window, Vertigo and North By Northwest finally culminated into one timeless masterpiece. Hitchcock knew what most of today's directors of thrillers and horror movies have forgotten  how to build up tension and sympathy for his characters. In no film did he do it better than in Psycho. And so, even if it doesn't seem half as violent and horrific as it did four and a half decades ago, and even if the shower scene isn't as convincing as we'd like to remember, it's still one of the scariest and most effective thrillers ever made.Psycho was clearly years ahead of its time, and it laid the groundwork for modern thrillers from Taxi Driver and The Conversation to Fight Club, Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Other than the fact that it's a perfectly constructed film, from the opening titles (by the great master Saul Bass) and the wonderful music (by the irreplaceable Richard Herrmann) which compliments and build the tension and horror to perfection; to the editing, the subtle dialog and the construction of each scene and each shot  Psycho stood out for the focus Hitchcock put for the first time on the villain character, to whom the heroes  Janet Leigh as the victim, John Gavin as her lover, Vera Miles as her sister, and of course the great Martin Balsam as the investigating detective  all take second place.Norman Bates is not only a lifetime performance for the great Anthony Perkins; he is the single greatest creation in the entire Hitchcock catalog, and one of the most fascinating villain characters in film history. It may be remembered that in Hitchcock's previous films  Rear Window in particular springs to mind  the 'madman' or villain character was the most unsatisfying and undeveloped element of the film. The murderer's motives are tackled here head on, and in this way it foreshadows many of the greatest thrillers of the 70's, 80's and 90's. Psycho is not about discovering the identity of the killer  that much can be figured out by any viewer from the first time Norman Bates is on screen. It's about exploring Bates's mind and psych; his dialog is written to perfection and Perkins's performance goes without a hitch.The only scene I still have problems with is the one in which Simon Oakland appears as a psychiatrist to explain to us Bates's motives and his story, thus spelling out what it seems an observant viewer can figure out for himself. Still, maybe viewers in 1960 weren't as immersed in psychological thrillers as we are today and so needed the explanation. This scene  anticlimactic and slightly too long  aside, the finale is still one of the most memorable and chilling in film history, and in my mind more impressive that the famed shower scene, making the entire film an unforgettable experience and one of the most effective ever made. Psycho is an essentiality to any cinema lover.",Psycho
207,jem132,"Creating a Sympathetic, Multi-Layered Villain...",9,1 July 2006,"Was what Hitchcock did best, and he reached his apex here in 'Psycho'. I suppose one can put the blame on Hitch for the seemingly-relentless cycle of slasher flicks that are churned out today, for 'Psycho' started the rot. Yet what terrific 'rot' this granddaddy of the horror genre is.So much has already been said about 'Psycho' that adding a comment seems unnecessary, but I'll try and give a brief summary of my feelings towards this film: Hitchcock created one of his most fascinating characters (and one of cinema's absolute finest) in Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins gives a performance that is nothing short of brilliant as the conflicted protagonist, evoking both sympathy for his loneliness and disgust for his actions. Hitchcock manipulates the audiences feelings towards the villain, as he did memorably in the earlier 'Notorious' and 'Shadow Of A Doubt'. Perkins would never break free of this role for the rest of his life, and his Norman is truly haunting. His chilling final scene (his face) will blow you away.Our supporting cast give varied performances. Miles is excellent as usual in her role as Lila Crane; her and Perkins carry the acting honours away. Both John Gavin and Janet Leigh are reasonably good (Leigh handles the notorious 'shower scene' very well), but noticeably weaker in support (particularly Gavin- he just isn't a leading man).Hitch shot this in black-and-white for a purpose- the gore of his scenes would not go down well in colour. Also, shooting in black-and-white gives 'Psycho' an even darker, mysterious quality, with Hitchcock's brilliant use of lighting and shadow to create mood and suspense. It has the feel of a low-budget, roadhouse film, and this effect suits it perfectly.The suspense flows nicely throughout, apart from a rather slow and, at times, frankly irritating, opening sequence. Hitch takes a long time to set this one up, yet once we reach the Bates residence we know that we are in for one hell of a ride- that's when the picture becomes great. The only other significant downer comes near the end where the shocking order of events are explained through some rather (for today) quaint psychobabble. Apparently it was added in to try and explain the horror and motives to terrified audiences in the 60's, yet it comes across as hokey today.'Psycho' deals with then-shocking elements of theft, necrophilia, incest (you'll look at the term 'Mummy's Boy' on an entirely new level after watching this), adultery and murder. This was shocking on first release and it's content is still powerful today, resonating with a modern audience.The murders are handled brilliantly- the amazing, classic shower scene that takes everything we have viewed in the first half of the film and distorts it completely. It is brutal, compelling and, accompanied by Bernard Hermann's screeching violin score, quite terrifying. We don't actually see the knife jabbing into Leigh, yet we still see so much. In this, Hitch effectively 'shifted' the role of key protagonist from one character to another.It's so atmospheric- look at the visual effects used in the Bates Motel, the predatory birds (a recurring Hitchcock motif)that surround Norman as he eats with Marion Crane (another 'bird' from 'Phoenix'). Vera Miles searching Mother's bedroom for clues. The revealing scene with 'Mother' and the swinging light bulb.To say any more would be to spoil a fascinating cinema experience- just go out and SEE IT.9/10.",Psycho

209,FilmOtaku,Incomparable,9,5 August 2005,"The plot of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film ""Psycho"" is by now the stuff of legend; Marion Crane (Leigh), a secretary in Phoenix is desperate to marry her boyfriend Sam (Gavin), only Sam is still paying off debts from his previous marriage. One Friday a man comes into her real estate office with $40,000 in cash to purchase a house for his daughter. Instead of taking the money to the bank as her boss directed, Marion packs her bags and leaves town with the money, presumably to give to Sam so they can finally make a life together. After driving for a day and a half, she ends up stopping at a motel only 10 miles from Sam's home. The Bates Motel, operated by one Norman Bates (Perkins) is a creepy place shrouded with mystery, particularly the mystery that is Norman's mother, a driving force that looms over the property and controls Norman himself. When Marion does not show up for work on Monday, her sister Lila (Miles) comes looking for her as well as a detective, Arbogast (Balsam) hired by Marion's employer. Unfortunately they all find that as one mystery begins to unravel, another one, more quizzical and shocking is ready to take its place, and none of them are safe from the danger of the Bates Motel.I'm pretty sure that there isn't much more to say about this film that hasn't already been said; ""Psycho"" being one of the most studied and analyzed films in film history. (I myself took a class in college that examined parts of the film frame by frame, and have read books analyzing the film) However, I have to wonder if the sensation of the film and the fact that it is an instant classic, regardless if someone has seen it or not (truthfully, I have heard people say, ""Oh, that is such a classic."" And then later admit that they haven't yet seen the film at all.), sometimes waters down its mastery and the impact this film had (and continues to have) on the film industry as a whole. If you ever get the opportunity to see the art exhibit ""24 Hour Psycho"", wherein the artist slows the film down to make the running time span an entire day, or if you were to read the excellent book Shower Scene in Hitchcock's Psycho: Creating Cinematic Suspense and Terror by Philip J. Skerry, you can see how incredibly impeccable each frame of the film is. If you were to lay out any scene in the film and look at it frame by frame, you would have some incredibly compelling photographs, and that was exactly how Hitchcock intended his presentation to be.Aside from being a work of art, it is well known that ""Psycho"" changed the way that moviegoers attended the cinema. Because of the big event that occurs halfway through the film, Hitchcock could not have people continuing their normal practice of strolling into the theater whenever they felt like it. If any of these people came to see a Janet Leigh picture, they would be pretty confused at that point. So Hitchcock, ever the showman (and his own greatest publicist) announced that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie began. This was HUGE for its time. Besides changing the attendance factor, it was one of the greatest publicity stunts of its time. If people weren't going to go to the film before, they sure were going to check it out now. I'm sure that ""Psycho"" doesn't have as much of an impact to people who grew up on slasher films or other horror films, but despite the fact it was released 45 years ago, its secrets are now the stuff of general film knowledge, and personally, the fact that I have studied it clinically, when I went to see it at the classic movie house two weeks ago, I still found that my heart was racing and the hair was standing up on my arms during the very last scene of the film. Even more of a testimony to its impact is the fact that a friend that I attended the film with, who isn't much of a film fan, much less a classic film buff not only said that he was so tense during the film that he was on pins and needles, but that he wanted to see it again, and soon. Why does this film have such a forceful impact nearly five decades after it was first released? I'm sure that one of the several hundred books written about this film and Hitchcock's filmography could give you several reasons at length. But a simple answer may sum it up best for now: It's simply a damn good movie. 9/10--Shelly",Psycho
210,Atreyu_II,Intriguing,7,13 August 2010,"'Psycho' is nowadays highly praised as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest films but back when it first came out it got mixed reviews. I'm not that familiar with the cinema of The Master of Suspense, though.In 1960 colored films were already quite common (even Hitchcock's own films) but 'Psycho' was filmed in black and white. One can only wonder why, but I don't care about that. I'm not saying this just because I consider black and white a form of art but also because 'Psycho' is the kind of film that works better in black and white. It probably would be bad if it was in colors. The same way I wouldn't want black and white films such as 'The Window' (by Ted Tetzlaff) in colors, among others. 'Psycho', while I don't see it as the masterpiece many made it seem to be, is an okay movie. The old-fashioned feeling it gives is nice: the opening scene showing a lovely panorama of Phoenix, Arizona (where it takes place); the huge American cars of that time; the fact that it is in black and white; etc.The famous shower scene doesn't look minimally realistic. I'm not gonna spoil my reasons, but it's so phony that it's obvious how it was made. Nevertheless, I think it is well made (if that makes sense) and it certainly is effective when it comes to quickness, although not really scary... well, at least not for our standards. But it must have been so surprising in 1960. For me, the part when the same assassin kills detective Arbogast is scarier, as that scene is so sudden and when you less expect... not to mention that it is very quick!The violin sound makes a great piece of music and works well for the suspense of this film, which has many well made scenes of solid suspense. Scenes which give the feeling that you don't know what's gonna happen, but give the idea that something bad might happen. That's the case, for example, of a sequence when Marion is driving her car on a dark rainy night and the wipers of her car barely clean any rain. We barely see anything, just like her.This is a movie that, watching for a 1st time, it's almost impossible to guess that Norman's ""mother"" is actually Norman himself disguised and imitating her. But it's easy to suspect that he's not the innocent guy he seems to be at first, as he smiles of satisfaction when he sinks Marion's car on a swamp (with her body in the car's trunk).Although interesting, it's a weird movie. I hear that weird movies was one of Hitchcock's specialties. Janet Leigh does a fine job as Marion Crane. Other actors do well either. Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack is fantastic.The final shot, which shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, could have been longer. It's far too quick and ends too sudden. Practically the moment they show it the movie suddenly ends.",Psycho
211,mario_c,A major classic!,8,17 January 2008,"Definitely a major classic! This film by Hitchcock is for sure one of the major classics of all times in movies' history. The argument is very good, the plot is well constructed and if we forget about the dated production we really have a great film.It's a mystery-horror story that grabs you until the end. Of course that I already knew the final twist even before watch it (because of this film being so fairly known), so it wasn't really a surprise; but I guess that if I was seeing it for the very first time without knowing anything about the movie it would be different I bet I would be surprised! Anyway, the story is good, the characters are quite known (who didn't heard about ""Norman Bates""?!), the acting is fine and the soundtrack is a classic! Fantastic! Those string sounds are effective to create suspense! There's no doubt that this movie is ""the father"" of the modern horror! It clearly inspired many horror movies from the 70's and 80's and is still being a reference!",Psycho
212,rebeljenn,iconic,8,17 March 2006,"'Psycho' is one of the most iconic films of all time, and this film had a huge impact with an audience, and it has been considered one of the best films ever made. It is the sort of film that haunts us with its gradual build-up to disaster, excellent cinematography, and its ability to allow the user to imagine the horrible events taking place. (The creepiness of this film is in the stuffed animals at the beginning of the film, the huge house upon the hill, the darkness of the night, and that unforgettable and iconic shower scene.) This film is the master of suspense with some great camera angles. Mr. Bates ascending and descending the staircase in the empty, creepy house with the body of his mother heightens the horrors. It is easy to put oneself in the place of the characters. This film will keep one engaged with the constant action and the mystery. There's even a little element of humour and disgust. This is definitely one of the best films of all time. Everyone should see this at least once in their life.",Psycho

214,tonypeacock-1,Hitchcock delivers another triumph from a simple storyline,9,6 October 2019,"Another classic Alfred Hitchcock directed film from 1960 featuring one of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history.
It may be over fifty years old but a good story holds up no matter what. Hitchcock certainly knew how to bring a simple, suspenseful story to the big screen.Shot in old black and white I wasn't expecting much. How wrong I was.Featuring a psychotic individual with multiple psychiatric conditions, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).
He slashes Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) in the famous shower scene only about half way through the film. The music reminded me of the iconic Jaws theme by John Williams. Composer Bernard Herrman was behind the iconic slash theme.The film brings iconic horror elements to the screen many years before the Halloween and Freddie Kreuger films.Talking of Halloween, John Gavin plays a character called Sam Loomis. Was this the inspiration for the Donald Pleasance character in the Halloween franchise?There are elements of cross dressing, taxidermy, murder, theft of $40,000.A classic film that doesn't take two and a half hours to tell the story.
Hitchcock delivers again.",Psycho
215,RonellSowes,Pinnacle Of Horror,10,24 February 2021,"After embezzling $40,000, a woman(Leigh) must flee town before anyone learns of what she's done.
Right from the opening minutes, Hitchcock makes it clear that this a film that will go places none have before. Just the look alone gives that sense of boldness. The striking black and white cinematography is a stark contrast to the vibrant colors that had become a trademark of his over the past decade or so. But being the master that he was, he knew that this was the proper way to shoot the film.
The first twenty minutes or so of it, are really nothing like what comes later on. Involving Marion's escape with the stolen money and the suspicion her strange behavior arises in those she meets. Either way it makes these scenes play, because there's still a tension to them.
After trading in her car, she pulls off the road, due to the rain, and into a motel-The Bates Motel. She happens to be the only customer at this remote place run by an odd, young man, Norman(Perkins), who lives with his invalid mother. Anthony Perkins so convincingly portrays the various and changing emotions of his character that you might almost be inclined to think he faces the same mental struggles Mr Bates does. What makes this character and performance considered to be one of the best is the complexity and contrast. Norman Bates has a friendly innocence to him that also touches into quirkiness. But in an instant he can fly into a seething contempt...and possibly even worse. Because in a few hours Marion is murdered by his mother(in a scene that might be the most famous of any film period) and Norman must dispose of the evidence. While Norman may be doing something wrong, Hitchcock still manages to tense up his audience with the car not sinking into the water. Even if you don't want to pull for him you can't help but urge for it to sink-that's why he's The Master.
Now here is where I reveal some of the greatest twists in cinema history; though I sometimes feel that this film has become so well known that many viewers might know what happens before they actually watch it. And that is, Norman's mother is dead and in reality he just has her cadaver and impersonates her at times. All of this is explained in depth by a psychiatrist(Simon Oakland) at the end of the picture, for the benefit of the audience. I probably could spend more time on some of the other brilliant moments in the picture like Arbogast's murder or the final sequence when Sam and Lila make a final investigation and revelation. However, I think enough has been said and those who have seen know, and those who haven't...well you just made a grave mistake reading this.Aside from Perkins and his magnificent performance the film also features Janet Leigh,who was the only member nominated for an Oscar for their work in the film,Vera Miles, the illustrious Martin Balsam and John Gavin at the peak of his contained career.
Of course I must also mention, if even briefly, Bernard Herrman's score which I would describe to be as vital to the picture as the film it was filmed on.
Sixty years later, Psycho still manages to terrify with the same amounts of thrills and suspense it had upon its release in 1960 and remain as the pinnacle to the horror/thriller genre.",Psycho
216,perfectbond,Simply brilliant,9,28 September 2003,"Psycho is perfect in all aspects despite, or perhaps, because it was very unconventional (I cannot discuss this in detail without giving away a lot of the plot). The pure craftsmanship of the film is a joy to behold. The casting was perfect, there were plenty of surprises and needless to say scares, the music was very evocative, and in certain contexts there was even a great deal of humor. I think Hitchcock said somewhere that it was a comedy! Maybe he meant it in jest. Unlike a lot of films which fade from memory as soon as you leave the theater or take out the DVD, Psycho stays in your mind. Highest recommendation 9/10.",Psycho
217,elvircorhodzic,"""A boy's best friend is his mother.""",10,7 March 2017,"PSYCHO is a psychological thriller with elements of horror in which tension is gradually giving way to a sort of creeps. It is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch.During a lunchtime in Phoenix, a real estate secretary discusses with her boyfriend how they cannot afford to get married because of his debts. Forty thousand dollars in cash accidentally come into her hands. This is a great temptation for a young and unhappy woman. Her boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank. She instinctively takes the money and plans an escape to a new life. California is a famous destination of most of the fugitives. She has, because of the strong cuff, decided to spend the night in a small motel. A pleasant dinner with an attentive owner of the motel will be the last in her life...The story is very tense and shocking. It has offered some of iconic climax in the genre. Mr. Hitchcock did not give up from a classical narrative. He has managed, regardless of the situation and the probability to transfer tensions from one character to another. Hitch has paid attention to small details. The secret of the main plot lies in these details. A ghostly atmosphere has completely corresponded with violence, deviant behavior and sexuality. The soundtrack is excellent. All the protagonists are changing throughout the film. It is a kind of trap by Mr. Hitchcock. Compassion and understanding toward one of the antagonists in the film are certainly possible. However, a viewer loses a firm stance with regard to any kind of identification with the main antagonist. We hear a voice of the killer, we know some of his features, we are witnesses of his murder, but we do not see a clear character.Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates has offered an excellent and intriguing performance. The duality in his character has reflected through a family melodrama, violence by parents and a psychotic obsession. His unpredictability and alienation can cause a fear and admiration at the same time. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane is quite convincing in the role of an insecure and nervous woman. Both characters are in strong conflict with themselves. Norman has struggled with obsession and fear. Marion has tried to overcome her own passion and discomfort. He is completely disturbed person, who can not make decisions alone. She is an unfortunate woman who tries to escape from everyday life.The film has become unique in the combination of a sophisticated music and upcoming murder scene. Hitch has, in an intriguing way, played with the human psyche.",Psycho
218,barryrd,Psycho Superb!,9,21 April 2016,"This is a splendid movie that shows Alfred Hitchcock at the top of his form. This movie came right after North by Northwest, also by Hitchcock, so it has to be one of the best one-two punches by a director in film history. The first half of the movie, dominated by the character of Marion Crane, is to me, the superior part, without any disrespect to the rest of the film. Janet Leigh's controlled performance is so convincing we feel every nerve-wracking moment after that first excruciating misdeed. From the opening scene over the skyline of Phoenix into the hotel room of Marion and Sam, I was drawn into the movie in a way that only a great movie can achieve. Audiences often complain that a movie can seldom measure up to a good book; however, a great movie can do visual tricks and show nuances very effectively in the hands of a great director. This movie is a case in point. The camera zooms into an envelope holding $40,000 or a peephole where Anthony Perkins, as Norman Bates, observes Marion undressing. The music is like chalk on a blackboard as the sharp violin strings heighten the nauseating fear that we feel along with Marion. The closeup of the police officer in sunglasses is almost terrifying. The pounding of the rain on the windshield is something almost everyone can feel and in this case, it seems like the world is crowding in on Marion. Scene by scene we go from one vignette to another. Vera Miles, as Marion's sister, and John Gavin, as Marion's lover, give brilliant performances as they try to get to the truth of Marion's disappearance. The supporting cast is outstanding, particularly Martin Balsam as Abrogast, the private eye. Anthony Perkins gives his career defining role, although he had many great roles. This was the only Hitchcock role for Leigh and Petkins and they made these characters their own. Highly recommend because it shows the great potential of film/making.",Psycho
219,esteban1747,One of the best thrillers,8,19 April 2003,"Hitchcock was a master of his art, and this thriller is an evidence of it. Again a good black and white film with an extraordinary plot starred by Anthony Perkins, who was perhaps the best actor in roles of mad or abnormal people in the world cinema. To this we should add the supporting roles played by then still beautiful Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam, Vera Miles and John Gavin. But again Perkins was simply excellent. We all were afraid without seeing the killer and until the end we supposed as real the existence of Norman Bates mother. A thriller is good when the end is unknown and even unsuspected by the public, and these requirements are well accomplished by Hichtcock.",Psycho
220,jdkraus,It still has its power as it did in 1960,10,20 January 2008,"Alfred Hitckcock is the master of suspense and mystery. I have now seen four of his movies and I have to say that Psycho is not only among his best of film, but also among the best of the horror genre. Hitchkock's direction was simply marvelous in the 1950s and 60s, and still is today. From the intense facial close-ups to the distant and unusual camera angles, it is impeccable. The music by Bernard Herrmann also adds much to the suspense to the film. I was on the edge of my seat with every beat of the score.Anthony Perkins is simply remarkable as Norman Bates. He isn't the full scale, murder, blood-seeking type of villain that most Hollywood villains are depicted in modern-day horror flicks. He appears as a normal person but has a secret and dark personality. He's creepy and disturbing but yet subtle and calm. He can be pitied, but also feared.Janet Leigh, I will never forget her scream as she faces her inevitable death in the shower sequence. She was also superb in supporting as Bates' first victim. But in my opinion, I felt the shower scene was a little corny. I kind of felt myself laughing at the chocolate syrup that was used for the blood, which I expected to be in more quantity like in Raging Bull. Perhaps I'm just to the blood/gore of the 1980s and modern-day cinema. Then again, it was common for most movies in the 50s and 60s for people on camera to die without spraying an ounce of blood. Despite this little opinion of mine, I loved the movie. It still has its power as it did in 1960. 10/10",Psycho
221,Hayden-86055,One of my favourite ever films,10,21 January 2021,"Psycho is one of the most stylish and creative films of all time, easily in my top 5 films ever. Anyone who gives this below an 8 needs to revaluate their decision.Psycho is masterfully directed by Alfred Hitchcock and beautifully acted. Every character is brilliant, Anthony Perkins is sublime as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh is perfect as Marion Crane, it was refreshing to see a woman as the main character. But Norman Bates has to take the spot for best character, perhaps in any horror film ever.The plot is simple to follow, or it seems like it. Being shot in black and white allows for the picture quality to be very high and whilst you're watching the shower scene notice how much eerier it is to see just this shadow figure of a woman silhouetted and slowly advancing from the background, the appreciated low shot angles also heightens the manipulative techniques Hitchcock uses. Additionally all of the film's action is plot driven, there's not one scene that doesn't contribute in some way to the overall film.10/10: Probably the greatest thriller ever",Psycho

223,Geeky Randy,Geeky Randy's summary,10,25 October 2014,"Ahead of its time for its content, unconventional story structure, false protagonist and the presence of a toilet, Hitchcock's genius direction and Herrmann's chilling score is still gripping as many people today as it did in 1960. Janet Leigh is graciously brilliant in her role as an ordinary woman who is suddenly on the run for making a spur-of-the-moment snatch of $40,000 ($318,875.14 when adjusted for inflation), and Anthony Perkins is without a doubt equally memorable as the underwhelming, well-mannered, codependent manager of the Bates Motel.

224,acidburn-10,Where It All Started,10,7 May 2007,"The Plot = In the hopes of living happily ever after with her boyfriend (Gavin) whose getting divorced from his ex wife and still paying her keep, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals 40 grand from her place of work and leaves town and ends up at the creepy ""Bates Motel"" where she meets the shy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and well lets just say everything goes wrong for her after that.Well what can I say about Psycho that hasn't been said a thousand times before, well nothing only that I agree with all the hype and excellent reviews that I've read and has definitely stood the test of time through the years.In my opinion Psycho is definitely the one that ranks the top of the genre list, and if it wasn't for ""Psycho"" we've probably wouldn't have had all the great slasher flicks through the years such as the successful ""Friday The 13th series"", Halloween series, Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Black Christmas. All of which pays dues to this masterpiece, I mean if Psycho weren't made we may wouldn't have had all them slasher movies. I mean Psycho in my opinion inspired all these movies in some way but directer Brian De Palma is the one who uses Psycho/Hitchcock idea for many of his movies.Shot in black and white which does put some small minded people off and in my opinion it shouldn't, I think it wouldn't have had the same creepy atmoshere if it was shot in colour just look at the terrible remake which came out in 1998, but the less said about that the better i'd say. Brilliantly written and structured screenplay wouldn't have been half as effective with the proper casting, but Psycho definitely delivered in that department with performances from Janet Leigh who plays the unlucky Marion Crane who gives an vulnerable and sympathetic performance that had me siding with her despite her dishonest actions, Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates) was mesmerising in his touching, unsettling, insecure and layered role which nobody else in this world would ever compare to, I'd say he gives an Oscar worthy performance. Vera Miles (Lila Crane) Marion's sister gives a good performance as does Arbogast the unlucky private detective played by Martin Balsam gave an interesting performance. John Gavin (Sam Loomis) was OK, underplayed but didn't really do much.All in all Every element came together here to make this a visually arresting picture, directer Alfred Hitchcock was truly one of the greatest of all time and was definitely spot on with Psycho which is definitely his finest film ever.",Psycho
225,Movie-12,One of the best horror films of all time. **** out of ****,10,27 October 1999,"PSYCHO (1960) ****Starring: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, Janet Leigh, and  John McIntire Director: Alfred Hitchcock   Running time: 109 minutes    Rated R (for scenes of strong violence)By Blake French:	Alfred Hitchcock is easily one of the most acclaimed directors in film history--right up there with Stanley Kubrick and Steven Speilberg. His films defined horror for generations, especially with what many people are still calling the scariest movie of all time: ""Psycho."" Over the years, the movie has been given much praise. It has had the honor to be placed in the American Film Institute's best 100 movies of all time list. The film has had the privilege to be re-created in 1998 by great director Gus Van Sant, who also added new actors and coloration to this classic tale. ""Psycho"" also has had the fortunate pleasure to have been followed up by several time-lapsing sequels, although not equal in quality, which continued the story and characters beyond the original film's restrictions. On top of all this, the movie has a unique story line, unusual characters, imagination-provoking motives, and manages to conduct its rare structure like no other film. ""Psycho"" is one of the better thrillers of our time. 	First lets take a look at the unique but perfectly organized structure of this classic horror tale. It beholds what I call a false first act. The first act opens by introducing a character named Marion Crane, sister of Lila Crane, who steals $40, 000 from her employer one day and is in the process of leaving town when her situation is complicated even more. Marion is pulled over by a mysterious police man, who checks out the circumstances, and then allows her to continue on with her journey. He then follows her many miles to a car dealer, where Marion cleverly trades her current car in for a used junkie to camouflage herself from peering foes. Marion then continues to drive along the busy highway until a shielding rainstorm persuades her to stop to rest at The Bates Motel. (spoilers ahead) Then she meets the owner, Norman Bates, who explains to her that his mother is a lunatic. Marion then goes to her cabin where she is stabbed to death in the shower by an unknown predator who looks like an old woman.
	Extraordinary, a simply flawless false first act. The movie introduces a character, a problem, and complicates it for the character involved. Then the conclusion (the murder of Marion) solves the first initial problem, throwing us off balance. While we recover, the filmmakers open a brand new series of events, this time detailing the missing Marion Crane. A detective, Milton Arbogast, who tries to investigate Norman's mother, is also killed in the process of doing so. Lila's investigation of her own evolves the second act problems, all winding towards the same awe-inspiring denouement, which I will not have the audacity to reveal to you. 	Now for some nice pointers for ""Psycho"": The opening scene develops Marion Crane's romantic characteristics as well as her personal morals. The scene in which Marion decides to commit theft is never explained to us through dialogue like many lesser films would do, but through Marion's complex stares at the cash and her reactions to it. The police officer's behavior is a whole plot in itself, and since the character's point of view is so focused, we know nothing more about this suspicious man than Crane herself. The Atmosphere of the Bates Motel is one of the creepiest moods I have ever experienced in the movies. Not to mention the famous shower scene, certainly the most shocking and grisly slasher moment of all time. The investigation of Marion's disappearance has a specific odyssey to it--intriguing and unsatisfying. All these minor elements contribute to making ""Psycho"" the most talked about films ever. 	There is a small, but quite noticeable, opinion flaw in the last ten minutes of ""Psycho,"" however. It is the scene where the detective explains the disturbing behavior of Norman Bates to the film's remaining characters, but also to the audience. This scene has never been necessary. The picture would have ended with much more controversy and fantasy if the writers would have left the strangeness of Norman to the imagination rather than explaining elements to us, not to mention the fact that all answers are revealed in the many sequels. I think it would have been interesting to see what happened if Gus Van Sant would have left that sequence out of his re-make, after all, he added a lustful masturbation scene, so why couldn't he have taken out some unneeded material as well. Oh well, I guess, until another actor attempts to master the terror found in the eyes of Anthony Perkins, we'll just have to juggle around these ideas in our minds of how this near-perfect movie could have been better. Don't you love it when movie's make you do that!Brought to you by Paramount Pictures and Universal Pictures.",Psycho

227,virek213,"At the Bates Motel, you can take a shower...AT YOUR OWN RISK!",10,27 April 2002,"One can pinpoint with reasonable certainty where the modern horror movie really began.  It began in 1960 with the release of Alfred Hitchcock's all-time masterpiece PSYCHO.The story of Marion Crane stopping off at the Bates Motel and taking the shower which would live in cinematic history and infamy is so well known that no regurgitation of the plot is necessary.  But what is important to know about PSYCHO is the fact that it introduced a number of important elements to the genre that had never been used before.  It introduced us to the ""slasher"", in the form of Anthony Perkins' off-balance Norman Bates and his ""Mother.""  It bought the horror film firmly into contemporary times by being set in the present.  It also took a very unique approach to psychology and murder in a way that no film had done before, and few films have done since.What is the most significant about PSYCHO's celebrated shower murder, besides the literal knife-edge editing and Bernard Herrmann's classic shrieking strings, is the way Hitchcock depicts this scene.  So many slasher films entirely miss the point of that scene, focusing only on the (limited) blood.  But Hitchcock manipulates the film in such a way as to make this scene LOOK much more graphic than it really is.  It is a brilliant feat of movie-making on the part of the cinema's ultimate Master Of Suspense.Even the much-criticized final scene involving the psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) isn't very bothersome; he brings up the first real honest-to-goodness explanation of a disturbed killer.  As he relates Norman's story, he tells the group there in the room, ""He was never all Norman.  But he was often ONLY Mother.""Scripted by Joseph Stefano from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, and loosely based on the case of Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Geinn (which also inspired the 1974 cult masterpiece THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), PSYCHO remains a masterpiece to this very day, even after more than four decades of sequels, imitators, imitators of imitators, and an atrocious remake.  No self-respecting fan of horror or suspense movies should be without a copy of this genuine fright classic!",Psycho

229,gigan-92,"""We all go a little mad sometimes.""",10,14 November 2011,"Even amongst classic film legends such as Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963), arguably Alfred Hitchcock's most famous movie is Psycho (1960). Considered a horror icon, it excels in both cinematic tension as well as sheer terror. It accomplishes this through a variety of techniques, such as composer Bernard Herrmann's chilling score, or the ominous low-key lighting of John L. Russell's cinematography. Consider in itself the mise en scene of the creepy Bates Motel itself. But an important factor that some might overlook would be the editing, done by George Tomasini. Tomasini often worked with Hitchcock, this film being one of his major highlights. Though often subtle, but its presence can be detected throughout the film.The editing in Psycho creates its mood and aids in revealing plot details. Without it, the film would not be what it is. We would be thrown off with Marion's ambitions, and certainly the bizarre and frightening nature of Norman would also be off key. Let alone that, the story itself would be lost in terms of interpretation of time. Each aspect of a film plays an irreducible role, and the same goes for editing.",Psycho

231,sashank_kini-1,I shouldn't have been too excited,7,8 November 2007,"From the past one month, I went all gaga about watching the 'classic' movie Psycho. I kept reading about it. The effect it had caused on all. My grandmother told me that it was really creepy and scary and my father warned me that I would wet my pants!I roamed all around Vadodara, my birthplace in India but couldn't find even a single shop that sold the DVD or the VCD of the movie. Finally, God had heard my prayers. Psycho was going to be shown on the television.I watched it with my mother and sister. My sister went all huddled in a blanket from the very beginning. Overacting, that's what she does, and I got wild at her whenever she talked loudly while the movie was going on, asking spoilers; how the movie would end? Why did she do that? Who was the mother? And what not!And I kept waiting for something the fright the s**t out of me throughout the movie. Unfortunately, I did not find it eerie, scary, frightening at all. But I kept reminding myself that it was a movie of the 60's when there were inadequate means of adding special effects and the video cameras too would have been old and therefore not much effects could be added.I thought the black and white color of the film would make it more frightening but unfortunately it too didn't help that much. Till the end, I kept making excuses, siding the film, about how not much facilities were available at that time.It is a timeless classic and therefore, it is hard for me to give a rating more lower than this. But after watching movies like King Kong where the inhabitants of the Skull island were unfathomably creepy looking, the skeleton of the Mother didn't make me even shiver a bit or make my heart thump faster.The story too was nothing too extraordinary, but an excuse I can give for this is that maybe there are a lot of movies after Psycho which have borrowed somewhat the story from the movie and therefore I found the story of Psycho a bit lame. But I feel that the story could have been better, especially the ending, because Agatha Christie too was I think, alive at that time, and the suspense in her books gave me creeps and made me perplexed. An excuse: Don't read any suspense books before seeing Psycho.But I loved the script, though the story was a bit lame. The dialogs were crisp, especially Anthony Perkin's famous quote:- "" A boy's best friend is his mother"".The acting was superb and all the actors were at the top notch. But no one could make my shift from my place, because I heard a lot that its a creepy film.I would give it a seven out of ten, but still, I felt that it should have been scarier, or rather, it is my err that I was born in 1993 and watched this film in 2007, when loads of special effects enhanced the horror in films.",Psycho
232,moviesleuth2,Truly Terrifying,10,24 July 2008,"If you go on YouTube there are a number of short films that can be viewed from there. ""Psycho"" feels like one of those, both in its story and its construction (though ""Psycho"" is about 10 times longer than most of the shorts you'd find on the internet). That's part of its charm; it's simplicity gives Hitchcock a lot of room to work with, and really develop every last detail to create its greatest impact. The fact that the film survived almost fifty years (and a remake) proves that all the work paid off.The less said about the story, the better (in fact, the best thing to do is to go into this movie knowing as little information as possible). I will say this: A woman (Marion Crane) has just stolen $40,000 from her boss and skipped town to join her boyfriend, and on the way she stops at a motel.There are two names (of real people) that are always going to be associated with ""Psycho:"" Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins (arguably Janet Leigh would also be mentioned, but she doesn't create the impact that the other two do in my opinion). Both of them work wonders here. Hitchcock has created the perfect film; everything works so brilliantly that I can't even find words to describe it. Down to the last detail, Hitchcock meticulously constructed one of the most awesome and terrifying films ever to grace the screen.People may not remember Anthony Perkins' name, but anyone who has heard of ""Psycho"" will recognize the name Norman Bates (which is the point of acting, though the opposite is the case in today's world). That is how effective his performance is. I recently watched ""The River Wild,"" where Kevin Bacon does a terrific job of portraying a character who is sympathetic in the beginning and a total psychopath later on. Anthony Perkins accomplishes the same thing, and his performance is a lot more effective. At the beginning, he's a young, boyish sort of man who is a motor-mouth at the beginning because he is absolutely smitten with the beautiful woman who has just stopped at his hotel. His charming personality slowly turns to being a frightening one as the movie goes on, and this is accomplished with the same effectiveness. It is especially noteworthy that he does this completely in sync with Hitchcock's direction.The other actors are understandably overshadowed by the Hitchcock and Perkins, but to their credit no one can hold a candle to what they accomplished. Actually, the other performances are very strong. The females are the most successful, especially Vera Miles. Miles is the perfect anchor for the film. She finds a balance between anxiety and determination. Even though she is not given much to work with, she creates a sympathetic sister. Wide-eyed Janet Leigh is also good (though she overacts slightly at times) as Marion Crane, and her scene when she talks to Norman is delicately handled (though even she can't help but be out-shined by Perkins). Martin Balsam brings a noirish feel to his character, but he still fits right in. Like Perkins, John Gavin has a change of character, though he goes from charming to determined instead of psychotic. Gavin makes Sam Loomis easy to sympathize with.James Berardinelli, a film critic that I greatly respect, said that ""Psycho"" is not Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film is not his best because it lacks the story and character complexity of ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo,"" the latter of which I have not seen. I respectfully disagree. Why? Because it doesn't need them. ""Psycho's"" simplicity works to its advantage, and it's clockwork like procession adds a deeper level of fear that a film with more complexity in any area would not be able to create.I often say that ""Halloween"" is the scariest movie of all time. Strangely, though, I gave that film an 8/10 and this one a 10/10. The reason is because while ""Halloween"" is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen (and in some parts scarier than this one), it is not without flaws. ""Psycho"" is flawless and, maybe because it's been a few years since I have seen John Carpenter's film (and a lifetime before I will see it again), more polished. I also said that ""Halloween"" creates a high level of suspense with minimal violence, and that is true, but ""Psycho"" does it with even less.Earlier in this review I said that it is better to go into this film knowing as little as possible. This is true, though ""Psycho"" is so well-known that many people already know a lot about it, especially the ending twist. I was one of those unfortunate souls who knew about it, and while I have to admit that a lot of the impact was lost because of this, Hitchock still delivers the goods well enough to warrant a viewing.""Psycho"" was remade shot for shot by Gus van Sant in 1998. It would be interesting to see what difference there is in the two versions (though I've heard the remake is terrible). Still, I'm going to see the remake and be the judge. But maybe I'm making a mistake, for the reported awfulness of the remake may taint the praise I have for the original. That said, nothing, not even ""Halloween,"" can hold a candle to ""Psycho.""",Psycho
233,davidcarniglia,California Charley Scores A Sale Before Breakfast,10,27 November 2020,"I almost wish that Janet Leigh had made it to Fairvale, and skipped the Bates Motel. As much as I like Anthony Perkin's performance, I sort of resent that he steals the show. This had the makings of a pretty good film noir; then, Norman Bates lays on the gothic horror story, very effectively so. Marion seems fairly composed dealing with Norman; he's the polar opposite of Sean Connery's Mark from Hitchcock's Marnie (1964). Still, Norman's role, as the blond protagonist's male counterpart, is similar in that he's her shadow, her hidden self.No doubt that nerdy Norman is a good deal more wacky than suave Mark. Not just in manner and appearance, but in the danger posed by their mental conditions. Suffice it to say that both guys have strange hobbies. Both Janet Leigh and Tippi Hedren steal from their employers, more or less as a way to be self-sufficient. But Marion wants to get married, whereas Marnie can't stand men. I might say that Marnie represents Hitchcock's attempt to stay with the female leads story, which in Psycho, diverts onto Norman's track about halfway through.Funny, but macabre bit when Marian's sister (Vera Miles) and Arbogast (Martin Balsam) come calling at Sam's (John Gavin's) hardware store. An elderly lady is considering buying a pesticide, she's wondering whether it causes suffering to the wee critters. With Norman's collection of animal artifacts, she may as well be speaking for him. I don't get how Lila (Miles) knows that Arbogast client isn't going to prosecute her sister. Anyway, the pivotal conversation between the cool Arbogast and the wilting Norman is amazing. ""Did you spend the night with her?"" Maybe the detective should've asked if she took a shower. ""It isn't jelling"" Norman's painfully stuttering story, that is.Anyway, Arbogast, intrepid as he is, returns to the Bates motel; geez, he's going to the old house. He's going into it...well the old lady (?) stabs the private eye. Considering the lurid nature of both murders, I don't see why Leigh's gets way more attention than Balsam's. The sexual aspect of Leigh's murder definitely gives it more impact. Anyway, the good ol' boy Sheriff (John McIntire) doesn't appreciate getting rousted in the middle of the night by Lila and Sam. Still, he's curious about the ""old woman"" both Sam and Arbogast spoke of in the old house.""You must've seen an illusion, Sam"" he tells the puzzled guy. Naturally both Sam and Lila look into the Bates motel. Norman must be beside himself having to deal with these pesky folks asking questions. They theorize that Norman must've made off with the purloined loot. They find a tell-tale calculation on a scrap of paper, pointing directly to both Marian and the money. Well, Norman can't have anyone prowling around the old house, right mom?Right. The denoument is perfectly staged: the skeletal corpse, Norman in her garb, Sam wrestling with him as Lila freaks out nearby, the swinging lamp animating the skeleton; and the music! It's as tangible as the knife. ""Can I bring him his blanket?"" Says Norman's guard. Although the shrink says in effect that he's become his mother, her voice scolds him, as he sits there listless, ending with a jack o'lantern grin. Pretty much the end.This time around, everything added up for me. Despite my disclaimer about wanting a full-boat film noir, I can see why Hitchcock chose to mix up the noir with horror. In a sense, it's like a sequel to a good noir; we see what happens after the bad stuff happens--that is, even worse bad stuff.If there is a resolution, it may be that Sam and Lila, thrown together in this, may, or could become a couple, compensating partly for Marian's elimination. Although Norman remains the focus even in the last scene, he's already irrelevant; we're back to the everyday world of county sheriff's offices, psychiatrists, Sam, Lila, and the whole rest of normal (not 'Norman') life.I might quibble, as some do, with the geographic details of Marian's trip from Arizona to Fairvale. It takes her an entire evening and into the next evening to drive from Phoenix to the outskirts L.A. (with time out for sleeping at the side of the road). Since Sam has no trouble visiting her from Fairvale when she's in Phoenix, it's hardly as far as all that. Then there's the strange juxtaposition of summer in Phoenix with Christmas time in California; it certainly hadn't taken Marian six months to drive, what, 400 miles? So there's some seams showing in the plot logistics.It's possible that Hitchcock somehow overlooked these time and distance discrepancies. It's more likely that he fudged it; either because he didn't care, or because he implied something else. Maybe the point is establishing, or embellishing the psychological distance between the workaday works of a big city, and the mythic timelessness of the Bates motel. I'm not suggesting that I've discovered a hidden subtext here, but that this illogical bridge between the two halves of the movie can be viewed subjectively, and not simply as some mistakes.Altogether a fantastic, macabre, and creepy movie.",Psycho
234,movieguy1021,Psycho: 10/10,10,19 January 2003,"Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movie is only forty-three years old, yet it rings fear into the hearts of millions of people, each scream louder than the next. What movie is this? Why, Psycho, of course.It begins with a swift opening credit sequence that is low-tech but does the job. Just like the rest of the movie. This, along with other Hitchcock films, is what horror movies are. You don't need excessive blood and gore and amorous teenagers. All you need is a decent story and tension galore.Actually, this landmark films is pretty much thrill-free for the first half. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary. She is asked to take $40,000 to the bank, but instead she runs away with it, without telling anybody. She then decides to check into the Bates Motel and chats a bit with loner owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). She then takes a shower.Everybody knows the plot, everyone knows the shower scene. What most people also know is how great this film is. It's finely crafted with superior music and terrific acting all around, with some symbolism all around. First, the music.Bernard Herrmann, who produced the score for most of Hitch's other movies, did a top-notch job here, also. His strings orchestra really brought out the noir-ish mood. Even when Marion is just driving, you still feel tense because of his A+ score. The superimposed voice-overs that weren't very frequent were also quite good; it seemed like you couldn't tell whether Marion was thinking that or not. Hitchcock is a great directory; his camera shots and precise timing are superb. Most horror filmmakers try to carbon copy his style, but never succeed, because they don't have any of his wit and superiority. This is a fine craftsman at work.Perkins is eerily great. He manages to be vague and yet vulnerable. He's being overpowered by his overbearing mother who lives in the house behind the motel. He seems like he could be a nice guyuntil he snaps. Leigh is also great, along with Vera Miles (Marion's sister Lila), John Gavin (Marion's boyfriend Sam), and Martin Balsam (P.I. Arborgast).I don't understand why Psycho was remade thirty eight years after it came out. Nobody needed to see it in color, with new actors, and the same scene-by-scene! It probably would have been a lot better if Gus Van Sant (who directed the new one) did a `reimagining', like Tim Burton and Planet of the Apes. Sure, William H. Macy is in the new one, but I've seen some of it and it's just horrible.Reading up online, I see some symbolism throughout the movie. Norman's obsession with birds (his middle name is Francis in the movie) means he wants to fly away from his mother. Something that I always love in movie is when they put `hints' of the movie in. For example, in the office where Marion works, there are two pictures: one of where she will be pulled over by a cop and one of a swamp that comes into play later. That type of stuff I always find fascinating.Look for Hitchcock's cameo (like he always has) as a man in a cowboy hat around four minutes into the movie, outside of Marion's office.My rating: 10/10Rated R for two scenes of violence.",Psycho
235,Min111,A classical horror movie,7,27 February 2019,"This is one of the finest horror movies ever made. This is unlike most horror movies out there. Psycho had such an interesting story to tell. The movie had so much suspense. It was so interesting. Everything was literally perfect right from the very beginning. The timing of every scene was beyond perfect. You could tell just how perfectly well everything fell once the movie starts. Norman Bates is the highlight of this film. He's as psycho as you can get, and the amazing thing is that he looks all so innocent. That scene in the shower was pure gold. Whenever people hear, think of this film, I'm sure one of the very first things they can remember is that shower scene with the lady screaming. The other being Norman Bates of course, who is probably one of the greatest movie villains in all of world cinema. This movie is unpredictable, and that's why Psycho was such a great film. I was shocked with the ending. Never for one moment, something like this would happen, and in some ways, I was actually disappointed by it despite being really clever. In other words, mother was terrifying to say the least.",Psycho
236,mfellipecampos,Very good,8,21 November 2019,"I liked this critique of Rotten Tomatoes: Infamous for its shower scene, but immortal for its contribution to the horror genre. Because Psychosis was filmed with tact, grace and art, Hitchcock not only created modern horror, he validated it.",Psycho
237,TalesfromTheCryptfan,The greatest horror movie ever!,10,21 June 2006,"Marion Crane ( Janet Leigh) is a working woman in Phoenix Arizona who just took away some very important money from her boss and runs away to a motel owned by a strange man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins)who owns the motel and lives in a nearby house with his bizarre mother. She meets her final fate over there at the motel, investigations start occurring on some mysterious murders happening at the motel and to see who might be the murderer.This just happens to be the mother of all horror movies in my humble opinion and it's also one of the all-time great movies! Alfred Hitchcock has brought the book from Robert Bloch to the big screen and turned it into one of the scariest and most suspenseful movies to ever hit the screen since it debuted in 1960 making audiences aware when taking showers. The shower scene is one of cinema's most terrifying and unforgettable moments with incredible tension that makes the viewers feel for the characters, the score by Bernard Herrman is total classic for sure and the movie went on to become an important landmark for the horror/thriller genre for years to come.It's often imitated and rip-offed a lot of times and paved the way for slasher flicks since then but nothing can ever come this much close to the original masterpiece that started it all!",Psycho
238,RossRivero99,The Very Best movie of 1960,10,1 July 2014,"Perhaps Alfred Hitchcock's most acclaimed film Psycho is a film that should have won best picture, and best director instead of Billy Wilder winning both awards for his film that came out in that same year The Apartment. The movie tells the story of two of the most important characters in the film which begins with Marion Crane (played by Janet Leigh) a woman who stole $ 40,000 in cash to go see her boyfriend Sam (played by John Gavin) then after running into the police she goes to a car shop to borrow a car then on a rainy night goes to the Bates motel where she meets a man named Norman Bates (played by Anthony Perkins)who seems nice but really is a troubled psychotic maniac. Who then dresses up in his mother's clothes and ends up killing Marion in the most famous scene in the movie ""The Shower Scene"". Then a private investigator (played by Martin Balsam) and her sister (played by Vera Miles) search for her. When I was watching this film last night for the very first time I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen because of how scary and well done the film was.

240,LoneWolfAndCub,Quite simply my favourite horror film which still manages to scare me!,10,13 August 2006,"Psycho, ever since I first saw it, has stuck with me. It is my favourite horror film and I can confidently say it always will be. Nothing comes close to the sheer thrills and chills Psycho delivers. From Hitchcock's masterful direction to Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins' flawless performances to Bernard Herrmann's unforgettable score, Psycho is the ultimate in real horror.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her employer's client and leaves town intent on starting afresh. While on the run she stops by Bate's Motel where she meets the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). They dine and converse for awhile then she returns to her hotel to get ready for bed and make amends for her crime. However, she takes a shower before this during which she is brutally stabbed to death by an unseen assailant. Her absence does not go unnoticed, as her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), and her sister Lila (Vera Miles) begin to question her whereabouts. Also hot on her trail is Detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam).Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho traded the supernatural beings of the genre's past (vampires, werewolves and zombies) for a human monster. The film made Norman Bates a household name in the world of horror and movie villains. Hitchcock does not rely on cheap, hokey scares to terrify his audience, but uses various camera angles and tracking shots to heighten the tension and then, accompanied by Herrmann's shrieking score, lets lose a shocking image. Hitchcock is quite simply, as his common title suggests, the Master of Suspense. He knows how to tap into the movie-viewing public's collective psyche: By making his monster seemingly normal and by blending sex, madness and murder in a sordid tale.The cast is spot on: Janet Leigh, in one of her more famous roles, is the naïve ""leading lady"" who meets her demise in the now infamous shower scene. Anthony Perkins gives a chilling performance as Norman Bates, his deceptive normality which masks his madness could not have been more convincingly done. Vera Miles and John Gavin provide excellent support in the last half, they both had great on-screen chemistry! Herrmann's famous score is arguably the best of any horror movie (it has been parodied and imitated countless times) and Hitchcock's direction is flawless (just look at the ending, which still shocks me to this day)! 5/5",Psycho

One of the people visiting mentioned she'd never seen it, so he popped-in a tape and we all enjoyed it again.It now presents not only the same ""classic"" genius of a great director's most famous work - but with the decades since it was made provides an historic view of the ""noir"" genre, and stars of the past in their more youthful days.This was perfect for Tony Perkins. His constant twitches, peculiar mannerisms and demeanor, and always somewhat weird persona, were perfect for Norman. Janet Leigh was beautiful to view, even in this key. but necessarily shortened. role. Although the two sequels, and another ""prequel,"" never equaled this original (no surprise), I couldn't help but run them through my mind as I watched the original again.I also remembered one professional reviewer's subsequent humorous comment (I believe for Psycho III), remarking that (after therapy) ""Norman's doing better, but 'Mother' isn't doing so well.""",Psycho
242,policy134,The sex,9,28 May 2011,"Off course, this is an awesome movie. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, sadly, never were given better parts. Leigh lived to be nearly 80 years old, so this part must have been somewhat of a annoyance to her. It probably didn't help that she had one of the most famous ex-husbands and daughters in the world. We all know what fate had in store for Perkins.Seen today, the movie is a bit tame and slow at times, but what it must have felt like for a 60s audience to see a film that was basically about sexual desires, although no explicit sex is shown. Look at one of the first scenes, where Marion is talking to an investor. He checks her out from top to bottom and makes an obvious play for her in full public. I can't recall I have ever seen such a scene from a movie that was made in the early sixties, and have rarely seen it in a movie made up and until 1966. The reaction from Hitchcock's daughter is also rare to see in a mainstream film from that time. She just treats it like it was something that happens every day. That was particularly unheard of during the rather strict 50s.More talk about sex. Janet Leigh in the white and black bra. I still don't know how they got that past the censors at that time. Hitchcock must have had an enormous field day with those shots. Also, the shots of Leigh's stand-in, where you actually see a very quick shot of breasts. Unbelievable. It's funny to dwell on this today where you can see pornography every minute of the day but for a 60s audience? That took a lot of guts to put that in.As for story, it is not the most original. Mamas boys were well depicted even to the point of insanity as way back as Jimmy Cagney's part in The Public Enemy. The execution, however, was of course something new. I do think my interest fell a little bit after Vera Miles comes on-screen. She is a good enough actress, but her part is thoroughly bland. So is John Gavin's, although he does match wits with Perkins in a rather smart scene at the end of the film. Martin Balsam as the private investigator is brilliant. In the scene with him and Perkins, you sense just how smart both of these people are. Perkins stumbles a bit in his testimony but doesn't really give the detective any conclusive evidence of guilt either. In a more mainstream film the detective would have been smarter than the crook.You could analyze this movie to death and many have. What you cannot do is diminish it's importance. Many barriers were broken in entertainment in the 60s and Pcycho is directly responsible for breaking down those barriers.",Psycho
243,Beejerman,STANDING OVATION! - (10 stars out of 10),10,8 April 2021,"The stage curtains open ...Alfred Hitchcock has had so many good movies, that I'd be hard pressed to identify one as his masterpiece. But, if I had to choose one, ""Psycho"" would probably have to be it. This is quintessential Hitchcock - without a doubt. I was born 8 years after this film came out, so I didn't have my first experience with ""Psycho"" until much later. Even though it was an older film by then, and it was in black & white, I can tell you that I was afraid to take a shower after I'd seen it!Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real estate secretary, is tempted to run away and start a new life with her secret lover, Sam Loomis, when $40,000 practically lands in her lap. She succumbs to her temptation, packs her bag, and hits the road. But when a heavy downpour of rain forces her to pull over for the night, she finds herself off the main road and at Bates Motel, a forgotten corner of the world. Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the motel's owner, befriends her and they share a dinner together in which she learns of his invalid mother, and his frustration of living with her. It causes her to reflect on her own situation. She makes the decision to return the money, but a little too late as it turns out leading to one of the most suspenseful stories ever told.For the fan of thriller/horror films, this one is a must see. In fact, it is a must own. Everything that made Hitchcock stand out above the rest is present here - his camera work, chilling musical score, strong characters, and a deep plot with an ending you didn't see coming. This is truly a classic that has aged well, and that has spawned three good sequels, and a remake. Norman Bates and his motel have become a cultural icons and have influenced countless writers and filmmakers over the years. This is the cream of the crop.I saw a reviewer in here rate this movie at 1 star. Really? 1 star? You need to have your head examined.

244,Horror-yo,"Top, top cinema",9,30 May 2016,"This is one of the best horror films you'll watch in your life, and no this review is not just another band-wagon follower. This movie isn't overrated and its reputation isn't exaggerated. It truly is excellence if you've ever seen it on the silver screen. The utilization of the protagonists is unique and makes for a standout dynamic in this film, while at the end the twist is truly completely unexpected. And I'm saying this now at a time when we've seen it all in every possible way, so at the time this was just light-years ahead of its cinematic period all things considered. All actors play their part just fine and help establish at each moment, along with the excellent cinematography (all in subtlety and allusion) and soundtrack, a particular feel, or a specific lingering emotion. It's really very well done, and some parts are just spot-on like it is rare in film. But Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates just steals the show here amongst the cast. In this film, there is an unsettling weirdness that oozes out of him, and it is never overdone, nor is it ever unremarkable. It's just...just right. Moreover, the plot revolves around a fairly common, and very real occurrence: the Oedipus complex. And it's so well carried out throughout the film, and never gives in to over-exaggeration although it would remain of course a very extreme case. But never does this turn into overdramatic cheesy 60's horror cinema, and the tensions are handled perfectly, as always with Hitchcock, cleverly and meticulously. The only criticism I would give this is the too obvious explanation at the end and overall that ultimate elaboration scene just isn't realistic, in regards to a few things. Finally, the very last scene with Norman Bates' inner-monologue, and the way Perkins acts it out, and that smile. Just ...perfect.",Psycho
245,oOoBarracuda,Psycho,9,7 November 2016,"Alfred Hitchcock directed probably his best-known work in 1960 with his feature based on the book of the same name by Robert Bloch. Starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, and Hitchcock's abandoned would-be star Vera Miles; Psycho explores a desperate woman's attempt to forge a life with her boyfriend, and a man driven by his relationship to his mother. Psycho is a wonderful case study into the psyche of human beings with vastly different outlooks and intentions for their lives. Hitchcock delved into the psychology of humanity in a way to make audiences pay attention all the while creating a complete masterpiece and the film most closely associated with the famed suspense director.On a December day in Arizona, the audience meets Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who has just spent an extended lunch hour with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Sam is divorced and lives far from Marion so the only time they have together is stolen lunch hours and hotel rooms. Sam is reluctant to further his relationship with Marion, despite the intense love shared between the two, because he pays a monthly alimony to his divorcée wife. Marion has a deep conversation with Sam in regards to the future of their relationship, as she wishes to become a married woman and create a home for Sam. Leaving the hotel room feeling helpless, a little desperate, and enslaved by her love of Sam so much so that she knows herself to be unable to leave him. Upon returning to her office, Marion's boss brings in a client flashing around $40,000 in cash for a transaction. Marion, being the one trusted to take the large sum of cash to the bank, instantly devises a plot in which she and Sam can enjoy a life together, married, together, and happy, if she can get away with the $40,000. Instead of going to the bank, Marion scurries home to pack a bag and embark on a new life. After speeding away on her new mission, Marion's boss passes her on the street initiating a guilt trip that Marion can't escape. After taking a nap on the side of the road, Marion has an interaction with a police officer which puts her even more on edge. Marion, convinced she must trade in her car for a new one after seeing her boss on the street, hastily makes a deal with the dealership o\owner and speeds away hoping to avoid suspicion. After an especially rainy night, Marion has become unsure of her location and pulls into a secluded motel. Emerging from her car for shelter for the night, Marion meets motel owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly nice young man who helps Marion inside with her bags and offers to make her dinner so she doesn't have to go back out into the rain. After hearing a heated exchange between Norman and his mother, Marion offers advice and consolation for Norman, believing his mother to be an overbearing negative presence on his life. Norman is clearly taken aback by what he perceives to be an attack against his mother, Marion is taken aback by his strong reaction and seeks refuge to her room as she has already begun questioning her plan and seems to have decided to go back to Tuscon, return the money, and make amends with her boss. Little does Marion know, Norman and his relationship to his mother would interfere with her plans.Psycho has reached the point that there is little left to say about this film. It's a near perfect entry on Hitchcock's filmography. Psycho is so closely associated with the famed director that it has been endlessly analyzed and heralded for the masterwork that it is. The standout from the film, other than the brilliant direction of a largely dialogue-driven plot, is the fantastic score. Bernard Herrmann, a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, crafts a perfect horror/suspense score that is as iconically connected to the film as the John Williams score is to Jaws. Granted, I haven't seen much of Anthony Perkins' work, but he was perfectly cast in the role of Norman Bates. Norman had to embody a psychotic crazed maniac inside a quiet, unassuming petulant child all at once, and Perkins was perfect for the extreme marriage of characterization. Martin Balsam is a brilliant character actor and it's always fun to see him pop up in a film. As earlier stated, Psycho is a surprisingly dialogue- driven film, with only a few shots of action sparsed throughout the film. The pivotal scene in which Marion and Norman share dinner together, bringing Marion back to her good- natured self, was filmed in such a perfect way highlighting the taxidermied shells on the wall exposing the possibility that Norman could be a much more sinister character than he initially appears. Hitchcock proves his strength as a suspense director with his seminal classic, Psycho. Near-perfect direction, incredible casting, and a brilliant score, it is clear to see why Psycho has stood the test of time, and remains a favorite and yearly Halloween viewing tradition, for myself anyway.",Psycho
246,ronakkotian,One of the most important horror films to ever exist!,10,8 May 2021,"WARNING: *SPOILERS*Psycho is considered to be one of the most important and influential horror films of all time and I couldn't agree more.Psycho follows Marion Crane, a secretary that embezzles $40,000 from her employer's client and ends up at the Bates Motel run by Norman Bates.I really had my first encounter with Psycho through its infamous shower scene. It was something I discovered when I was young and it chilled me to my core. Despite its lack of gore, that scene still sends chills down my spine and it's due to Alfred Hitchcock's incredible execution. The iconic score by Bernard Herrmann, the build up of tension and Janet Leigh's scream all combined make up one of the best scenes in cinema to ever exist. It's easy to not appreciate that particular scene now but I cannot imagine how shocking it must have been for audiences in the 1960s. Hitchcock was really ahead of its time. It's blows my mind how he subverted audience expectations by killing off the protagonist within the first hour. That shower scene will forever be etched in my memory.The next best part comes from Anthony Perkins. Janet Leigh got many accolades for her work but it's impossible to deny just how magnificent Perkins is as Norman Bates. The final shot of him transitioning from an innocent looking person to an absolute psychopath is enough to prove his acting capabilities. Resorting to obvious tropes in regards to killers, Hitchcock presents Norman as a likeable and charming character and uses that aspect so well to make the upcoming twist even more exciting. The development given to his character is told in such a unique and surprising manner making Norman Bates one of the best killers to ever exist in films.Psycho is masterful on every single level. The way Alfred Hitchcock builds suspense and horror is exceptional. It's insane just how much of an influence this film has on many horror films that came afterwards. To think we may not have had classic slashers like Halloween for instance if something as unprecedented as Psycho wasn't made or as successful financially. I honestly wish I saw this with an audience in the 60s just to experience the shock they felt watching this for the first time. Psycho will remain as one of the most important horror films to exist.",Psycho
247,garethcrook,Timeless.,9,13 April 2020,"Last night we did The Birds, tonight it's Psycho. I always think of these two being connected, it must be because I discovered them close to one another as they've nothing in common. Psycho has that edge that The Birds doesn't really bother with, largely I suspect because of the shower scene and the abundance of stabby stuff. It's a much smaller cast and simpler in its aesthetic, also black and white. I adore the black and white though, I can't imagine it in colour, one of the many reasons the remake was unwatchable. It starts of course with Saul Bass' cool tiles, maybe only rivalled by North by Northwest in Hitchcock films. Saul Bass is a genius. I'll admit I'd forgotten quite a lot of the early scenes, the scary policeman, the voice over exposition as Marion Crane leaves the city in her car, on the run with her ill gotten gains. It's all about the motel and the house though isn't it, but as we get there that fateful stormy night and as much as I love the shower scene, it's Arbogast's interrogation of Norman that always felt more of a pivotal scene, as Norman gets caught in his lie and his (or his mother's) crime begins to unravel. The tension built with the noir P.I. and his death scene on the stairs I always thought was cooler than the shower... although credit to the shower, Tomasini's cutting is superb. I'd forgotten also quite how much happens away from the Bates Motel with Marion's sister and boyfriend trying to find her and the money she stole, but again this all just helps to make the pacing work as well as it does. Psycho always feels dumbed down to Janet Leigh's famous demise and Bernard Herrmann's groundbreaking score, but there's so much more going on and I love Anthony Perkins' performance. Hitchcock characters can often feel a bit flat, all surface, the lights are on, but Perkins as Norman is genuinely creepy and nails pretty much every scene... apart from maybe that last one as he bursts into the basement with his mum's frock on. Psycho is far from Hitch at his best, but it's still a gripping watch. It had my first time viewing partner switching from ""It's not that scary"" in the shower, to ""Oh my God, don't go in the basement!!"" for Mother's big corpse reveal. Not shocking by today's standards sadly, but every bit the timeless classic.",Psycho
248,braddugg,"Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.",10,4 May 2014,"Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.To pigeonhole this as a thriller would be wrong as per me. It has a murder mystery, a psychological thriller, a huge amount of drama, and even a family backdrop. With all such elements, it would be wrong if I were to categorize this as merely a thriller. Yes, it is filled with thrills and for the 110 minutes of running time, there is hardly any dull moment.I have seen this movie, a number of times before and each time it had a terrific impact. Also, I have always found something new, maybe a new frame, new shot or a new background sound. The discovery does not seem to stop. This I attribute to the many elements that are involved in this film.From placing the camera, composing the shot, revealing the right emotion and making the audiences wait till the shocking aspect is revealed, Hitchcock is at his best in this film. This is indeed one of the more simpler stories he dealt. Yet, he made it so impact full that it continues to surprise audiences even today. Thanks to the music by Bernard Hermann, whose contribution to the film is very important. I cannot imagine this film without the music and I believe that it's because of the music, that the resonance was acquired.If it's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impact full. Now, I do not want to reveal those and give away some details. I can simply say, I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else. The cast is perfect equally, Anthony Perkins does a wonderful job as Norman Bates. He is cold blooded and yet looks so deceptively humane as an extremely caring human. This film and ""The Trial"" are perhaps the most important films in his career. It is the first psychological thriller of it's kind as I read in various other sites and perhaps it is also the most violent films made. Though the violence comes for less than 10 minutes, it haunts so brutally, as if it was there all through the film. It's a definite 5/5 for one of the finest films of all time by one of the greatest directors.http://braddugg.blogspot.in/",Psycho

The actors are very convincing, special mention to Anthony Perkins who delivered a brilliant performance. Finally, the direction and mise-en-scène are of a high level as always, with great attention given to details.But the most surprising thing is the two distinctive parts. The plot and main character defined at the beginning of the movie aren't the same at the end, because after about 30 minutes, the script takes a big turn, for the viewer's delight. How could one have anticipated such a twist so early in the movie and that shift in the story ? This is probably the best aspect of Psycho.If there were any reproach to make, it would be about the lack of realism of the murders, especially the shower scene which incomprehensibly remained the token of the movie.But it's minimal and Psycho remains probably the most accomplished feature of Hitchcock.",Psycho

Marion then wonders more into the state where during her departure not only does she get a new car to be incognito but stays at the Bates Motel where Norman Bates comes out and sees that she's by herself and needs company. To Marion, she thinks Norman is just a nice guy until the voices from the house start to ring where maybe something isn't right after all.And that's where it all begins.I love Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" as a thriller, but I don't get why people are calling it a great horror movie just because of the shower scene and Norman dressing like his mother. I think of Psycho as a crime/thriller/drama film where people need to understand that Marion committed a crime of stealing the money and after her death in the film, her disappearance along with the money is still involved when the detective starts questioning those involved with Marion about her whereabouts.This is the only Hitchcock movie where I can't keep my eyes off for one damn minute.",Psycho

When Janet Leigh steals a bundle of cash that she is supposed to deposit in the bank she has no choice but to split town. Unable to continue to drive in a blinding thunderstorm, she loses her way off the main road and ends up having to spend the night at the Bates Motel.The infamous shower scene has been talked about ever since it scared the heck out of everyone who saw it and some women were so frightened they couldn't take a shower for days afterward. Even after all these years there are still some people who haven't seen this film and refuse to see it.The house behind the motel where Norman lives with his mother is a masterpiece of set design built at 3/4 scale to make it look more ominous, and it sure does look ominous. Anthony Perkins is totally convincing as the loner mama's boy.The movie was filmed by a TV crew in black and white which was a total departure from Hitchcock's widescreen VistaVision color films such as Vertigo. This is a movie that you can see many times and always take away something new. Once again Hitchcock creates a film that can be read on different levels.

The Master of Suspense directed a lot of great films throughout his astonishing career such as ""North by Northwest"", ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", and ""The Birds"". But ""Psycho"" is my all-time favorite Hitchcock movie. Everything about this movie is great in every way. From the splendid performances by the entire cast (especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in their most famous roles) to Bernard Herrmann's eerie and famous music score to Hitchcock's use of unusual camera angles to the site of the Bates Motel and the creepy house that sits above it to the dark humor that is presented and to that unforgettable shower scene, ""Psycho"" is a brilliant horror film that will live on for years to come. Now just forget about that stupid shot-by-shot remake from 1998. The original 1960 picture is definitely the one to see. **** (out of four)",Psycho
257,nickenchuggets,"""A boy's best friend is his mother""",10,26 October 2021,"By now, everyone should be familiar with Hitchcock's amazing skills as a director. I've already discussed many films he was responsible for, mainly the early ones that don't get a lot of attention. Now it's time to do the opposite and talk about possibly his most acclaimed movie. Psycho has acquired such a legendary reputation through the years that it is usually considered one of the best horror movies ever. Although the horror element doesn't come into play until you're almost halfway through, this film definitely delivers a large amount of truly frightening and traumatizing scenes, one of which in particular is so well known that most people will recognize it even if they never watched this movie. As always I'll begin by explaining the storyline, which involves a girl named Marion (Janet Leigh) who decides to go into work one day and swipe a huge amount of money from her boss. She does this because her love interest Sam (John Gavin) has a large amount of debt that he needs paid off. After Marion steals 40k dollars, she falls asleep in her car on the side of a road that night and wakes up to a cop tapping on her window. Although she didn't break any laws, the cop is strangely suspicious of her panicky behavior. This later gets confirmed when Marion visits a car dealership to trade her car for a fresh one, even though there's nothing wrong with hers. After driving for some time, it starts to darken outside, so Marion pulls over to sleep at a motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). At first, Norman seems like an outgoing and friendly enough person to Marion, but as they continue their conversation, he gets hostile when she suggests Norman's invalid mother should be institutionalized. After they talk, Marion retires to the room Norman gave her, and he proceeds to spy on her via a peephole in his room that was hidden behind a painting. As Norman watches Marion undress and step into the shower, he makes his move. He sneaks into Marion's bathroom, pulls back the shower curtain, and stabs her to death. He then puts her corpse in the trunk of her car and drives it to a swamp, where it sinks into the bog. As expected, Marion's sudden disappearance does not go unnoticed. Her sister Lila (Vera Miles) questions Sam about the fate of her sister, but he knows nothing. An investigator named Arbogast (Martin Balsam) shows up and says he has an interest in Marion's disappearance, but only because he's trying to find the money she stole. Arbogast heads to the Bates Motel in order to find out what its proprietor knows about Marion, but Norman is actually really cool under pressure when put on the spot like this. He appears very calm while being interrogated so Arbogast can't tell if he's lying or not, but his explanations do have a few discrepancies that Arbogast exploits. Norman says Marion left early the next morning, but there's no way he could have known that considering he told Arbogast he didn't recognize her face. Eventually Arbogast falls into the same trap that Marion did when he asks questions regarding Norman's mother. He at least wants proof of her existence, but Norman turns him down. After trying to get to the bottom of this, Arbogast is stabbed to death by Norman in the old mansion behind the motel. Arbogast's demise has an immediate effect on Sam and Marion's sister, who now realize they have to travel to the motel themselves. The investigator hasn't been heard from in a while, so they are certain something happened to him. Upon arriving, Sam awkwardly strikes up a conversation with Norman to buy time for Lila to search his house. By the time Norman realizes the girl Sam came here with is nowhere to be found, Lila has already journeyed into the mansion's basement and makes a horrible discovery: the rotting corpse of Mrs. Bates is sitting in a chair waiting for her. Norman finally shows up and, determined to protect his secret, tries to stab Lila, but is disarmed by Sam. Norman is arrested and placed in confinement, and Marion's car is pulled out of the swamp by chains. Psycho is, in my and many other people's opinions, Hitchcock's masterpiece. He never really made a downright bad movie, but this one has got to be the best. No matter how many times I watch it, I just want to see it again. I even wish I could get rid of my memories of it so I can experience it for the first time once more. It is one of few movies that has a stellar cast all around, and basically none of the performances are lacking. Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and especially Anthony Perkins were all awe-inspiring. The movie also presents a unique idea for Perkins' role, because instead of him being a heartless killer, he apparently does everything he can to please his mother. It even explains in the movie how Norman pretended to be his mother when he murdered Marion, because her soul apparently took over him completely. He talks in his mother's voice and acts surprised when he sees Marion's dead body, suggesting that Mrs. Bates was in control of his actions, not him. Just a strange new take on split personalities. Originally destined to be an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Psycho proved that a longer runtime can very well mean a larger audience. A less noticeable trait though is how it basically paved the way for more violent movies such as Friday the 13th, even though the killing in this is pretty tame compared with something like that. One important fact about this movie that not many people realize is how Joseph Stefano wrote the screenplay for it. He was the same person responsible for creating the popular 60s science fiction show Outer Limits. This blew my mind when I read it because I had no idea. Of course, there have been many sequels, remakes and spinoffs of Psycho, but nothing beats the original story of a psychotic man killing people under the influence of his mother. To be clear, Psycho has easily earned its reputation as not just one of the finest horror movies ever made, but one of the finest films ever made, period.",Psycho
258,baileycrawly,An Absolute Classic,7,5 September 2020,"Finally, 60 years after its initial release, I got around to seeing Psycho after hearing references all the time and, of course, seeing the shower scene pop up in every compilation of greatest horror moments, or in essays and other writings about the genre. Ultimately, it's deserving of its iconic status: this is a truly fantastic film.In terms of personal preference, I don't like this one quite as much as Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist, which are at the absolute top my list, but this film is worthy of its praise. It was ahead of its time, showing the audience things that had never been shown before (the first flushing toilet in American cinema, for example), it portrayed things that were taboo and often not discussed by the ""polite"" society of the time, and it is perhaps the greatest use of a musical score in history. That grating, screeching music is burned into the collective conscience of society, to the point of some people thinking of that score every single time they step into a shower.Anthony Perkins is a fantastic Norman Bates. There's no question about that. Having just seen the original for the first time, I'm interested to see how he expands and develops the character in subsequent instalments, because there's definitely a lot of potential there.And, of course, we have Janet Leigh, my personal favorite part of the entire film. Mother to Jamie Lee Curtis, Leigh earned the ""iconic horror badass"" crown just 18 years before her daughter would go on to do the very same thing in ""Halloween."" Janet's character isn't the traditional stupid character that ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time; she makes some bad decisions, but she's intelligent about the way she handles things, which is really nice for a change. Of course, without spoilers (if you don't know by now, you must be new to the genre), Janet is the face of that iconic shower scene, and it truly is one of the best scenes in classic horror history. It's not particularly graphic (dealing with censors back in the day had to have been an absolute NIGHTMARE), but it effectively finds that ""sweet spot"" between showing the audience what they want and pleasing the powers that be.A lot of time has passed since Psycho first came out, but the passing of time hasn't tamed this beast. It's inevitable to view the film a little differently in the light of present day, but it still has the power to raise the hairs on the back of your neck 60 years later. While the shock might not have the same effect, the emotion that it's able to create in the viewer makes this one a guaranteed success.",Psycho
259,SKG-2,Set the standard,10,15 March 1999,"1960.  Alfred Hitchcock is, for his time, king of the world, with a string of hit movies, a hit TV show, and even growing critical respect (from ""auteur"" critics like Andrew Sarris and Francois Truffaut).  Flush with all of this success, did Hitchcock continue making the glossy entertainments he excelled at in the 1950's?  No.  Instead, he made a low-budget film which was obviously influenced by B-movies (notably the ones made by William Castle) and what he had learned on TV.  The result was PSYCHO, and it's safe to say movies were never the same again.Many articles have been written claiming Spielberg and Lucas have been responsible for the decline of movies today, and have been responsible for more cheap rip-offs than anyone else.  It seems to me Hitchcock and PSYCHO have inspired (if that's the right word) more rip-offs than Spielberg or Lucas put together.  Not just the obvious ways, like the many horror films which pay homage to it (DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN), or the films which have spoofed it(HIGH ANXIETY).  There's also its influence in narrative(speeding things up, instead of taking time to tell the story), its reliance on fairly thin characters, sparse dialogue, and of course, that music.  Someone more qualified than I could go at length at how Hitchcock's technique here has echoed throughout moviemaking today, but that influence to is undeniable.  I guess to sum up, PSYCHO does what Spielberg, Lucas, and every blockbuster film have been accused of doing; making a B-movie on the scale of an A-movie(of course, Hitchcock had a lower budget, but he did have stars like Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, and well-known actors like John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles).As the rip-offs shouldn't put you off the Spielberg and Lucas films, nor should the rip-offs put you off of PSYCHO(I haven't seen the remake yet, but I still want to).  No matter how many times you've seen it before, the shower scene still packs a wallop.  So does the climax in the basement, and the final shot of Norman.  Perkins avoids the mistake most movie psychos (pardon the expression) make today by hamming it up; although you suspect something, you're prepared to dismiss him until you find out the truth.  This isn't my favorite Hitchcock (that honor goes to NORTH BY NORTHWEST), but it's a classic.",Psycho
260,mcfly-31,Hitch's best,7,12 January 2001,"What else can I add about this film?  One of the more famous settings ever (the motel), one of the most famous movie names (Norman Bates), and of course, probably the most memorable killing on film (shower, anyone?). There's no real point in summing up again, but, what the hay.  Leigh embezzels money and skips town.  She ends up at a remote motel and has dinner with the owner (Perkins).  Though long winded, the scene in the parlor stays captivating with the dialogue and the subtle music softly in the background.   They both discuss the things wrong in their lives, his biggest problem, his domineering ""mother"" (and I always wondered if people who haven't seen the film thought of when every critic always put quotations around mother).  She retires for the night, and while unwinding with a shower, is brutally knifed by some woman.  The mother?  You'll find out if you haven't seen it.  The rest of the film deals with Perkins trying to cover up the crime, as others come looking for Leigh.  I say it's Hitchcocks best, but that's mostly based on the fact that I didn't like his other movies (""Frenzy"" was ok).  Performance wise, you couldn't ask for much more, as Perkins is terrifically understated as Norman, the role that pidgeon-holed the rest of his career.  He pretty much carries the film as the others, good actors no doubt, have little screen time.  A sequel followed 23 years later(!), one I went for more being a kid of the 80s. Part III was good as well (Perkins directed nicely), but IV was a lame made for cable film.  There was also an awful remake in 98, check it out at your own risk.  As far as the beginning of it all, it can be slow in spots, but is a well told story and one of only a few films before the 80s that I liked.",Psycho

Perkins allows Norman Bates to get under your skin, and he stays there.  He tricks you with politeness and sincerity, then his creepieness seeps in.  Shot on a very small budget, with the crew from the Alfred Hitchcock Presents tv show, Psycho is the ultimate low budget horror flick.  But what Hitchcock was able to do, it take horror out of the shadows, and shine light on it.  The real shock in Psycho comes at the end, where Norman is sitting there in the holding room.

263,domino1003,Serious Mother Issues,10,24 October 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock had created a classic film about a young man with serious mother issues. As ""Psycho"" begins, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)is desperate to keep hold of her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin), who is struggling to keep financially afloat (Alimony and paying his father's debts). She decides to help by stealing $40,000 from a client of her boss. Skipping town, she stops at the Bates Motel during a stormy night and meets Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who is devoted to caring for his mentally ill mother.

With Sam on board, they soon find out the secret of Norman and his mother.Perkins could never escape the role of Norman (He eventually came back playing Norman 3 times), and you can understand why: under that sweet facade is a very unstable individual.

265,lagudafuad,What a thriller...,8,7 September 2012,"They don't come any crazier than Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). This Psycho thriller was a classic horror movie in the 60s, with a score (soundtrack) that is breath taking.It also had four Academy Award nominations. Psycho is considered one of Hitchcock's best films, and it is ranked among the greatest films of all time.The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Robert Bloch which in turn was based loosely on the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein.Paramount felt the book was ""too repulsive"" and ""impossible for films"" and they did not like ""anything about it at all"" and denied Hitchcock his usual budget. So, Hitchcock financed the film's creation through his own Shamley Productions.The movie was then shot in black and white to keep the budget below $ 1,000,000.The movie story is about a Secretary who embezzled $ 40,000 from her company, to go share with her boyfriend.On her way to their meeting place she stops over at a motel, owned by Norman Bates, who has been long under the control of his mother and is out of place in this world.The famous shower scene, which was the murder of Janet Leigh's character in the shower, is the film's pivotal scene and one of the best-known scenes in all of cinema history. As such, it spawned numerous myths and legends. It was shot from December 17 to December 23, 1959, and features 77 different camera angles.

266,majikstl,It was a dark and stormy night...,10,13 June 2004,"(((((SPOILERS))))For most people, the most memorable scene in Alfred Hitchcock's PSYCHO, indeed it's most famous scene, is the shower sequence. It has been broken down and analyzed ad nauseam as an example of the fine art of editing. It is a great sequence, but to me the best scene in PSYCHO occurs just before that. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, on the run from having committed a crime, sits in the parlor behind the Bates Motel's office and discusses nothing and everything with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the motel's lonely proprietor. It is a chat between strangers who desperately need to talk to someone, anyone, but have no one to whom they can confide. It is a beautifully written and acted scene, which serves as the calm before the storm. For all of its flashiness and sleight-of-hand gore, the shower sequence isn't nearly as effective at showing what a master filmmaker Hitchcock was. It is in the parlor scene that the entire narrative spins around; as the audience is prompted to switch their allegiance from Marion to Norman. Nothing really happens in the scene, other than two characters talking, but how things are said reveals as much as what is actually said. Here Marion comes to terms with her mistake and decides to pull herself out of her ""private trap."" Norman introduces us, indirectly, to Mother and wins our sympathy, which is vital to the way the rest of the film plays out. The scene very skillfully sets the mood of uneasiness that propels us into the upcoming murder, even as it suggests that Marion is achieving a sense of inner peace. Madness is revealed, danger is suggested, yet the audiences is coolly and cruelly lulled into an almost tranquil state. It is obvious something is coming, but not so soon. Then the shower curtain is ripped aside and blood begins to splatter.The measure of a film like PSYCHO is not how cleverly it fools you the first time, but how irrelevant its surprises are to enjoying it time after time. Indeed, compare it to Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake, or even Brian De Palma's 1980 semi-remake, DRESSED TO KILL, and the power of the film is obvious. Van Sant's version, though a scene for scene imitation is barely watchable even once, especially if you are already familiar with the plot; and while De Palma's homage is stylish and intriguing the first time around, its psychology and plot tricks don't stand up on repeated viewings. By contrast, Hitchcock's PSYCHO can be viewed repeatedly with full awareness and appreciation of knowing what is coming up next. I think an element of Hitchcock's genius is apparent in that he doesn't treat his major plot twist as a just a gimmick. The entire first half of PSYCHO could have been treated as just a shaggy dog story, a prelude marking time until Norman Bates' story takes center stage. But Hitchcock realized that Janet Leigh's story had to be presented with all due gravity, otherwise the shift to Anthony Perkins' story wouldn't be nearly as effective. Neither Van Sant nor De Palma seemed to understand this, especially De Palma who treats the Angie Dickinson scenes in DRESSED with a cruel, condescending sense of humor. Hitchcock's PSYCHO works as a whole, but could very easily have been presented as two independent episodes of ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents....."" Marion Crane's story is not just a build up (though Hitchcock himself claimed that killing off his leading lady was all meant as a joke on the audience), but as a complete story unto itself, replete with the type of shocking twist ending that was the hallmark of Hitchcock's television anthology. Likewise, the Norman Bates half of PSYCHO, is a complete suspense tale in its own right. The shower scene is the bridge between the two stories, but it is the scene in the parlor that cements the two tales -- and the fates of the two protagonist. And if you look at PSYCHO as two separate parts of a whole, then Marion's story is revealed to be the more complete of the two. Norman's story, while beautifully done, is essentially a mystery story; Sam, Lila and Arbogast are trying to solve a whodunit: what happened to Marion and the $40,000? The cleverness of Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano is that they let us think we know the answer right off the bat, building to a conclusion where it is revealed how completely we have been fooled. In the end, we know little more than Lila and Sam. To some extent, this is the real gimmick of the film. On the other hand, Marion's story allows Hitchcock to make so much out of so little. He creates tension, even though there is no tangible threat. Marion is on the run with stolen funds, but the theft hasn't even been discovered yet. All of the danger is strictly in her mind: What will happen when...? She is a smart woman who has done something very stupid, but proceeds even as her fears grow and grow. But cinematically the suspense is created out of mundane things: a policeman's face at the car window, rain and windshield wipers slashing across the screen, the glare of on coming headlights. Mix this with the haunting voice overs of accusing voices and Bernard Herrmann incredible musical violence and the effect is hypnotic. But these imagined dangers do not prepare Marian or the audience for the real dangers ahead.And something has to be said for Janet Leigh. Always overshadowed by Anthony Perkins' iconic performance, Leigh never gets her due (though she was nominated for an Oscar, she lost to Shirley Jones in ELMER GANTRY). But she dominates the first half of the film with a vivid performance that is sexual, humorous and bittersweet. So much of her role depends on the subtlety of her facial expressions: her sad smile at pretending to believe Sam's excuses for not marrying her, her bemused glances at the flirtatious old millionaire, her self-satisfied smirks as she thinks about how people will react to discovering her crime, her mixture of concern and fear as she talks to Norman in the backroom parlor. Plus, she displays an attitude that is both smart and sexy. It is one of the great film performance.It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be.",Psycho

268,TaylorYee94,"Textbook of Alfred Hitchcock, of Thriller Movie, and of deliberate directing.",7,14 September 2020,"60s was the time that 'psychopath' or 'serial killer' was not even a term, yet Hitchcock accurately portrays the characteristics of psychopath as we know today (He even directly tells audience 'it is different from transvestite'). 60s was the time that films did not include nudity or murder scenes, yet Hitchcock turns the murder scene in the shower the most iconic murder in film history.Use of lighting and the shadow is very effective in Psycho to portray character's emotions. I love the scene where Marion drives away from Phoenix to Bates Motel. As the situation gets more troublesome in Phoenix, the lighting gets darker and so as actress' face.Mise-en-scene and camera position are exquisite as well. For example, when the private investigator goes up the stairs in Bates mansion, he is not placed in the center but a little left and little lower from the center. This imbalance causes uncomfortableness. At the same time, the background blurs a little bit except for his face. Audience can really focus on his face and be ready for what's about to happen.The score of this movie deserves more than it is already praised. When I decide the quality of the movie as a whole, the role of the sound effects can be minor. However, Psycho's score is the best of all time. It is the main component of creating the thrilling and ominous atmosphere of the whole film. It upgrades this film from great to excellent.The scene starting from the shower to scream is iconic, and it deserves its popularity. Build-up of tension including the score that sounds like scratching the chalkboard, the camera walk, and the shadow is just perfect. However, the scene that Norman cleans up the murder scene needs some attention as well. Without showing the body, blood, or scars, the director manages to create psychotic ambience and to make me nauseous with meticulous description by investing some time into the scene, calm demeanor of Norman, and constant changes of the position of camera angle.Psycho is considered one of the best directing of Hitchcock or of all time. It is just textbook: mise-en-scene, camera angles, lighting, score, and etc. The thing is textbook cannot be art. Psycho lacks artistic quality such as emotions or feelings while technique used in this movie is legendary. That is why it stays at 8.",Psycho
269,emperor_bender,Original Horror Classic,10,9 March 2008,"This movie is what I consider to be one of the biggest movie milestones ever.Alfred Hitchcock is truly a genius and this film alone is proof. Who knew this film would still be such a success almost 50 years later? This was a low-budget film, filmed in black and white when there was clearly color available. But the black and white makes it extra eerie. Also, the music and dark tone of the movie makes you on the edge of your seat. There are lots of small things that make the mood. Like Marion's lingerie is white in one scene but black during a much more eerie scene. The storyline is fairly simple but in 1960 was very original. Nowadays, every wannabe movie has the same idea but this is the movie it all originated from. The kills are very VERY memorable. Particularly the first one. Even 50 years later they are remembered. I must say, this movie shocked me more than many other much more recent horror films, not to say none others scared me but I will go so far as to say Psycho is scarier than much of the crap we see nowadays, like The Ring or The Grudge.I recommend this film to...everyone. You cannot call yourself a movie lover if you do not see Psycho! Watch the original, not the crappy 90's version! This movie deserves a 10/10.",Psycho
270,skybrick736,Psycho,9,24 August 2014,"I think it can be safe to say Psycho is Alfred Hitchcocks most notorious film and for great reason. He had a gift of such pristine direction and writing that will suck the viewer into the movie like I'm virtually watching the events happen. Janet Leigh's character rules, a strong women already, but just completely tail spins into situation after situation that digs herself deeper and deeper. It's at the Bates Motel were the consequence of her mistakes plays out, which then focuses the movie on Norman Bates played by Anthony Perkins. Perkins role of momma's boy with insecurity issues was played to a tee. Terrific acting, writing, dialog, pacing and memorable scenes all take place in Psycho. In my heart of hearts I feel Psycho may just have been the most meaningful movie to the horror genre.",Psycho
271,malkane316,"One of, if not the...",9,16 May 2004,"One of, if not the most influential horror movies ever, with many plot devices which have now become clichés, and proving that Hitchcock was the master of all genres. The themes can be talked about over and over, but it is the build up of suspense, coupled with Perkins's performance which keeps it fresh today. Perhaps not jumpy enough for some, although there are plenty of those moments, the film relies on the director's knowledge of the viewer: we are in his hands. Probably my favourite scene-when Bates bursts out of an upstairs room, with the overhead shot. Deliberately gritty and bleak, and no pimply teens to be found...those were the days. 9 out of 10",Psycho

275,PudgyPandaMan,"Definitely ahead of it's time, but pretty tame in modern times",8,20 July 2008,"I just watched this with my 12 year old son last month on TCM. It's hard to believe but it is rated ""R"" still now and I had to unblock parental controls to watch it with him. I am very strict in what I let my children watch so I hesitate to even call this a ""horror"" picture, although it probably was in it's day.To me it is more a psychological thriller. There is no gore whatsoever - although I understand the audience of 1960 would find this much more disturbing as the movie industry had yet to mainstream the slasher flicks that predicated the 70's.Here are some observational details that help make this the masterpiece it was and still is:-I found the opening score to be a great stage setter as it had an anxiety provoking tone to it.Perkins is perfectly cast for the Norman Bates character. No one else could have pulled off this portrayal like him. Perkins is very creepy - but I always found him to be a human uncomfortable in his own skin, which apparently he was in real life.To have the perceived ""main character"" killed off early in the movie was unheard of. It caught the viewers especially off-guard.The cinematography, especially the camera angles. There is something very uncomfortable in the filming that adds to the anxiety of what is going to happen next. For example, when Perkins is eating something in the hotel office and spins the hotel register around to read it, the camera shoots him under his chin while he is chewing. I'm not sure why, but it makes me uncomfortable. That is Hitchcock's genius in his direction and use of camera angles.If you haven't caught this masterpiece, you have to give yourself the pleasure of seeing Hitchcock at his best and why he was, and still is, the master of suspense!",Psycho
276,cat_ranchero,Masterful...,9,10 February 2013,"A truly excellent piece of filmmaking; yes, it's a bit 'wordy' in places, but that was the style back then. There are equally many scenes in which there is no dialogue at all and these are even better in my book. Hitchcock knew just how much to show the audience to intrigue them and I so wish there were more filmmakers around today who were as adept as he was. The performances were all excellent; particularly Janet Leigh as the conflicted felon and Anthony Perkins as the mentally tortured motel owner. The only thing I felt let it down was the very long explanation towards the end; where every nuance of the condition afflicting Bates is exposed. I didn't feel that much detail was needed; but I could be nit-picking a bit here. It's a great piece of filmmaking and one every fan of the movies should see at least once.SteelMonster's verdict: HIGHLY RECOMMENDED My score: 9.4/10.You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.",Psycho

278,steiner-sam,Famous really for one scene,6,3 June 2021,"This film has deeply entered popular culture for its murder-in-the-shower scene, and for the creepy character who ran an almost never frequented hotel.The plot is fairly straight forward. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her boss and runs away presumably to meet her lives-in-the-back-room-of-a-small-hardware-store boyfriend, Sam (John Gavin). Sam does not know of Marion's theft, because it was a robbery by sudden opportunity.Marion ends up at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman's invalid mother presumably lives in an old house behind the motel. After several awkward interactions with Norman, Marion prepares for bed and takes a shower, during which she is stabbed to death by a character who does not seem to be Norman. Norman comes, is aghast, cleans up everything, puts the body and all of Marion's belongings into Marion's car, and sinks the whole thing in a nearby swamp. Unknowingly he also sinks the $40,000.Marion's sister, Lila (Vera Miles) hires a private detective, Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to find Marion who now has been missing a week. After some work, Arbogast learns that Marion did stay at the hotel. He is determined to talk to Norman's mother but is murdered by her when he finds her.To try and find evidence, Sam and Lila then pose as a married couple and check into the hotel. In the climax, and through a long-winded explanation by a psychiatrist, we learn that Norman has a split personality and that his mother has been dead for 10 years. However, ""Mother"" has become the more dominant of Norman's two personalities.The drama is maintained at a high pace, as one expects from Hitchcock. He made ""Psycho"" in a budget of less than a million dollars, and also insisted it be in black and white since it would be ""too bloody"" in color. The whole story is the plot; the personalities of the people involved are not really developed.This is a good Hitchcock film, but its long-term fame comes from that one shower scene which is rather tame by modern standards.",Psycho

280,jayjaycee,"""A boy's best friend is his mother""",10,9 October 2019,"""Psycho"" (OV) is a 1960 horror thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock starring Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles. There aren't many old films that are still relevant decades after their release, but if there's one it's definitely this thriller. It's the textbook example of suspense and classic horror and in terms of excellence still unreached. It's known that Hitchcock was way ahead of his time and it really shows. How many other films from the early sixties start with a woman only seen in her bra? Also the shower scene shows a lot of nudity compared to the standards of that time. It really shows how daring the director was in his directorial style. To be honest, it all was for the better. The film may have a longer first act that introduces us to a side character, but simultaneously he tricks us into thinking that Marion Crane is the protagonists and makes her death (one of the best scenes) shocking and gives it even more momentum. But in the context of the whole film the storytelling is absolutely well paced and never loses it's perfectly balanced level. Additionally, the virtuoso score by Bernard Herrmann, probably the epitome of suspense, supports the overall enthralling atmosphere from start to finish, sinks it's teeth into your head and won't let you go until the film has ended. The most notable thing about this film though is Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates. I've never seen such an incredible performance, he perfectly masters every single character trait of his disturbed nature, as he plays both the shy and somehow insecure manger of a motel and the insane and malicious psychopath, with a strange and oedipal relationship towards his mother, with such excellence. To be honest, this is one the best representations I've seen in my entire life that personally inspires me as an aspiring actor. Just the way he manages to dominate a scene for almost 15 minutes without saying a word, only with his mimics and charisma are enough to prove my thesis. Also the final stare into the camera in the end literally gave me goosebumps. Besides this one-man show, the supporting actors still deliver great work nevertheless, but Perkins stole everyone's show. With unusual camera angles the director thoroughly captures the haunting atmosphere of the horrifying story. Next to iconic scenes, the final twist is one of the most magnificent conclusions of all time. All in all, this horror classic is as outstanding as it's claimed. It combines all, a packing plot, a haunting atmosphere and superb actin and in the end, I sat there with tremendous joy and awe. A day later, I still think about how awesome it is. An unforgettable experience of pure excellence that you won't forget. This is one of the many reasons I love my hobby!",Psycho
281,jcbutthead86,"An Excellent,Scary And Landmark Horror Masterpiece And One Of The Greatest Films Ever Made. Alfred Hitchcock At His Best.",10,21 October 2013,"Psycho is an excellent,scary and landmark Horror Masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made that is filled with amazing direction,a terrific cast,a fantastic script and a masterful score. All of those combinations make Psycho not only a masterpiece of Horror cinema,but also a masterpiece of cinema in general and is Alfred Hitchcock at his very best.Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch,Psycho tells the story of Marion Crave(Janet Leigh),a real estate office secretary that has been given 40,000$ in cash to take to the bank but when Marion doesn't do so,Marion takes the money and goes on the run. Scared and tired,Marion decides to stop at a Motel ran by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins),a young man that runs the Motel and takes care of his Mother. The stay at the Motel leads to horrific and strange turn of events.What can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho that hasn't been said before? The film is a flawless Masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest,scariest and most iconic movies of all time and is the first modern Horror movie that changed the Horror genre as we know it. Prior to Psycho,Horror movies from the 1930s to the 1950s had been done by Universal Films and Hammer Pictures and Horror films mostly dealt with monsters like Zombies,Vampires,Werewolves and creatures from outer space or were set in the 18th or 19th century in castles. But then in 1960 Psycho came out and changed Horror films forever and brought Horror into the modern world and gave viewers a different kind of monster which was a human being and Psycho would set the standard for Horror and Suspense Thrillers that came after Psycho and despite Hitchcock giving cinema many classics and Masterpieces Psycho is Hitchcock's most famous and iconic film. Psycho is a great film that right from the very beginning the movie pulls you into a frightening and terrifying nightmare that is relentless and powerful like a tightrope with white hot suspense that never stops until the very end. Psycho is also a great film because it gave audiences a new and different kind of Horror film that breaks all of the rules and conventions that are associated with Horror and Hollywood films with Hitchcock make people think the film is going to go one way when it goes another and the film gives you a sense of dread and offers no salvation or happiness. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Psycho are done with great timing and much detail and when the scary scenes happen they hit you like an unexpected punch in the face and your heart will be racing because with each scary and suspenseful scene Hitchcock is frightening you not only physically but mentally as well. The style and brilliance of Psycho would influence Horror films and Thrillers that came out years after Psycho's release. Probably the scariest and most suspenseful scene in the film is the famous shower scene,a classic and iconic scene that Hitchcock filmed with such a masterful stroke using clever camera angles and tricks making you watch in awe and terror. It's a scene you will never forget and will change the way you take showers forever. While the film is scary,Psycho wouldn't be as nearly scary without the atmosphere. During the 1950s,Alfred Hitchcock had filmed his movies in color but with Psycho Hitchcock filmed this movie in Black & White thanks to Jack L. Russell's beautiful and visually stunning photography which gives the movie a dark and beautiful Film Noir look that is harsh and bleak almost like you're in a living nightmare. The main characters in Psycho are wonderful because they are not Horror movie stereotypes or Cartoons but real people that viewers will relate to because of the horrific and dangerous situations that happen in the film. The screenplay by Joseph Stefano is amazing and memorable,with Stefano giving the main characters dialog that is tight and incredible. The ending of Psycho is amazing,scary and is an ending you won't expect or see coming. The ending of Psycho is twisted and shocking and is one of the things that makes Psycho a masterpiece.The whole cast is great. Anthony Perkins is excellent and iconic as Norman Bates,with Perkins bringing intensity and power to the role. Janet Leigh is brilliant in her most famous and iconic role as Marion Crane,with Leigh bringing depth and class to the role. Vera Miles is terrific as Lila Crane,Marion's sister. John Galvin is wonderful as Sam Loomis,Marion's boyfriend. Martin Balsam is fantastic as Milton Arbogast,a private detective. John McIntire(Sheriff Al Chambers),Simon Oakland(Dr. Fred Richman),Lurene Tuttle(Mrs. Chambers),Frank Albertson(Tom Cassidy),Patrica Hitchcock(Caroline),Vaughn Taylor(George Lower),John Anderson(California Charlie)and Mort Mills(Highway Patrol Officer)give good performances as well.The direction by Alfred Hitchcock is excellent and stylish,with Hitchcock constantly moving the camera and using amazing angles giving the film a great visual style and tone while doing a terrific job with the scary and suspenseful scenes. Masterful direction by Hitchcock.The score by Bernard Herrmann is brilliant,scary,intense and one of the greatest and most iconic scores in movie history and it truly matches the film's dark and frightening tone. Terrific score by Herrmann.In final word,if you love Alfred Hitchcock,Horror films or movies in general,I highly suggest you see Psycho,an excellent,scary landmark Horror Masterpiece,one of the greatest films ever made that you can watch again and again and is Alfred Hitchcock at his best.",Psycho
282,jackasstrange,Excellent,10,30 October 2013,"Arguably Hitchcock's Magnum Opus, 'Psycho' is a classic. It not only made contributions to the horror genre, but is also considered one of the most important films in the cinema history. And rightfully so. It is really worth of all the hype.Just mentioning a few things: The script is magnificent: The character development is great into the film intentions, the plot is well established, the conflict as is well established, and the resolution is... well, if you to see for yourself! And as a typical good thriller,it's full of extremely well-conceived plot turns and twists which probably would catch anyone to watch this film, being familiar with the genre and style or not. The soundtrack is just classic... seriously, which person in this world never heard the track in the infamous 'shower scene'? Also, it plays a big part in the scarier moments in the film. The acting as well is nothing less than excellent. Anthony Perkins as the Bates guy is just perfect. But my shoot-outs are really going to sir. Alfred Hitchcock. I have to say that this movie only would work with HIM being the director. No one could do what he did. This is also what makes Psycho so good and special. If you haven't watched it yet, don't waste your time: Do it now! 10/10",Psycho
283,zeekwunlau,On the Misleading of Details,8,21 April 2020,"The movie art of the 1960s was set against a black-and-white screen with a high-level texture, which also justifies the suspenseful atmosphere.Regarding this movie, I would like to talk about the detailed hints of the film and the functions of these hints in the movie. Of course, if it is more true, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is explicit.Because the language of the camera has always been a must-have reminder to the audience: This person has problems and this place is not right.Where is the specific problem and what's wrong? Read on.Let me talk about Cran first. Since Cran decided to run with her boss's $ 40,000 cash, her character traits have become prominent. What is it? It is ""panic"". And this ""panic"" has been running through her character until the moment before she died.On the way to escape, Kran spent the night in the car and was woken up by the patrolling police early the next morning. Her panic look instantly caught the attention of the police: a beautiful woman who parked the car by the road alone overnight, although she insisted that she did not encounter any problems and did not need help, but was very resistant to the police. ask.When the car dealers traded for the old ones, the car salesman had planned to spend a lot of money on the sales. As a result, Cran rejected the proposal to test the car, asked the price straight away, and did not make a counter-offer. There was only one request, and the driver was delivered immediately. This even led the car salesman to suspect that her own car was coming from a wrong direction.The heavy rain was unable to move forward, and Cran had to choose the Bates Motel by the night. At this time everyone knows that the feature film is about to begin. why? Because the audience can guess without any effort, the hotel owner Norman will not only officially launch as a transitional group performance, but as a major player identity.Regarding Norman's character traits, the director didn't hide it, and three or two lines and shots came out. The masked gentleman with a sensitive and emotional instability hides the meaning and is dangerous.So when he peeked at Klein's bath, the audience wouldn't be surprised, because this behavior was in line with Norman's character.However, when it was discovered that Crane was killed in the bathroom, his performance surprised the audience.At first he appeared a little panicked, this is the normal reaction of ordinary people. But the duration of this panic is very short. He calmed down quickly, and quickly packed the scene, the corpses disappeared, a series of actions, too smooth and skilled!But this time, back to the topic I want to talk about. Before that, I have been analyzing the details and hints. Now I can talk about the clever and misleading part, because the audience's sense of violation appears.The murder happened, the next step is to confirm who the murderer is.Who is it? The motel is equivalent to a closed space during a downpour night. In this space, there are only three people, the victim tenant Cran, the motel owner Norman, and Norman's sick, but full-hearted mother .The audience's first impression was that Norman was first ruled out, and the murderer could only be Norman's mother. why? Because we all heard, Norman's mother didn't like Cran, she had the motivation to kill.Drawing such a judgment means that the previous details hint that it has come into play, and the audience is misled unconsciously.However, there must be evidence for convictions, and we cannot guess by sentiment alone. So the audience looked down and found out that Norman 's mother was an elderly person with no mobility and resistance. How could such a person kill a young woman and a middle-aged man with a knife What?By this time, the audience actually had a vague guess as to who was the real murderer, only to wait for the movie to explain why the murderer did this and how.Finally, we know who raised the knife, but we are not sure who the murderer is.",Psycho

Historical value aside, the first half is a superb example of fine storytelling, and Anthony Perkins's performance is so natural that it makes me shiver every time. I like how the film makes such a big deal about Marion and the 40,000 dollars only to completely shift the focus halfway through. The second half gets kind of spoiled by Vera Miles' stiff performance but also offers an interesting twist. Nothing exceptional in 2020, but at that time it must have been something groundbreaking, as Hitchcock had to hire Simon Oakland just to explain the film at the end.",Psycho
285,ilpohirvonen,Mundane Freudian Horror from This World,10,19 May 2010,"At the age of 60, Alfred Hitchcock decided to go wildly radical after his award-winning big productions. His next film, Psycho (1960), was an independent production whose budget was only 800 000 dollars. Through this Hitchcock was able to make a film, entirely in a way he wanted to but also achieve a naturally mundane atmosphere which was still characterized by psychological and film noir-like elements. Psycho is still Hitchcock's most shocking film and the most influential film he ever made. Just like The Beatles, the death of Elvis and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so is Psycho a part of the cultural legacy of the 1960's. It marked a turning point in the history of American cinema and changed its being forever: reality was now approached in a brand new way, through a Hitchcockian prism of fear. In the central of Psycho there is a run-down motel which has been left to the side of a new highway: a picture of alienation, a system which progresses quickly, neglecting the actual needs of people. The motel is run by an extraordinary man, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives alone with his mother. One day Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a woman who has just stolen 40, 000 dollars, arrives to the Bates' Motel. Having disappeared, Marion's boyfriend and sister start to look for her. But Norman isn't too happy about it and tries to avoid their investigation.Like in many films by Alfred Hitchcock, the opening credits of Psycho are extremely important and fascinating. These opening credits were designed by the storyboard artist and pictorial consultant Saul Bass, who had also designed them for The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). The credits, together with the score by Bernard Herrmann, manage to set out the theme and the topic of the film. The credits are often seen to illustrate the decomposition of the human mind but also the change of order and disorder which is common for capitalist urban life. It is an expression of the ""new"" world order.The graphics designed by Bass don't just reign the opening credits: they're everywhere in the film. In the beginning, we see the horizontal Janet Leigh and her brassiere, and the vertical John Gavin, completely topless. The geometric polarity of horizontal and vertical lines repeats in concrete forms throughout Psycho: for example, the horizontal motel and the vertical Victorian mansion in which Norman's mother lives.Psycho is mundane, or as Michael Schmidt has said ""Psycho combines wonderfully the everyday and mysterious."" But it really isn't a b-movie. For Hitchcock the horror and excitement just happen to arise from ordinary, mundane things. Once again, the opening scene is a wonderful example of this: just a conventional, simple scene. Back then, the audience was affected by Janet Leigh's breasts and brassiere which were shown for the first time in the history of cinema but, what is more, the scene is so well filmed that the viewer can do nothing but get identified with the characters. Psycho indeed might just be the most polished thriller ever made. It's perfect, no matter how you look at it.Psycho puts the society to a collision between the shadows of past and presence. It conducted dialog between the old past and trendy presence. In the film, we meet two modern urban clichés: a regular office girl and a lonely youngster who also spends most of his time at his office. There is one intriguing scene which is a wonderful example of this: an unconventional love scene between two loners which, in turn, conducts dialog with the opening scene: now the characters don't talk about money and sex but about loneliness.The way I see it, if Psycho has got a thesis, it must be that fear is in ourselves. Marion is constantly put in scenes with mirrors: first in the office, then in the motel etc. The most luminous proof of the nature of this thesis is in the scene where Marion's sister (Vera Miles) scares her own reflection on a mirror -- a brilliant shot which soon became a cliché.In Psycho money isn't really essential. Money is present, all the time, but it doesn't make a difference -- it is insignificant. Hitchcock obviously wanted to show money just as a part of the society. It is a part of the air we breathe, so to speak. However, Psycho does also talk more widely about consumer society. A good example of the consumer culture is the scene where Marion quickly changes her old car to a new one. Even if her motive was to get away from the cops, the scene doesn't just talk about her personal hurry but about the social hurry inside us all. Psycho talks about the American society and about the transition, in the 1950's: how it turned from the conservative to more and more liberal in the 1960's but at the same became more alienated and anguished.I'm sure I could go on and on about Psycho but, unfortunately, there are limitations. To put it briefly, Psycho is one of the best American films ever made and its aesthetic, cultural and sociological influence is undeniable. Many have spent thousands of words just talking about the architecture of Psycho: how the mansion represents the Freudian psychic apparatus (id, ego and superego) and how much influence Hitchcock took from an American painter Edward Hopper (take a look at The House by the Railroad). Together with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960), Hitchcock's Psycho opened the gates for the graphically clear treatment for violence. However, it is much more of a film about our world than violence. Psycho is all about an example of voyeurism and alienation but, in reality, the criticism hits the whole perverted culture and society.

Hitchcock is obviously the last true cinematic genious. Genuinely ghostly this movie will haunt us for ever. Deserves to be among the greatest artworks of the 20th Century.,Psycho
287,jldmp1,Disembodied,7,17 April 2006,"Hitchcock declares up front that we're going to be on the edge of our seats while he has us captive. The music is shrill, obsessive.We float in through the window on two lovers breaking up. A tailing police cruiser drifts out of the rear glass while we watch the girl watching her mirror. The camera floats out of the girl's dead eye, pulls back on her face frozen in fear, it swings around, pulls in on the newspaper, then swings away to the haunted madhouse on the hill. It levitates up the staircase, focuses on the 'conversation' in the next room, backs away and upwards and views the hallway straight down, all in one movement...a more impressive minute than the entire contents of many other movies.Required film school viewing, absolutely. But also for us more casual viewers, this is a key movie we all need for understanding where visual vocabularies come from. The later borrowings from this are uncountable. The most literal borrowing from the shower scene is in the ""Raging Bull"" Lamotta/Robinson bout, matching the cuts from angle to angle and in the same rhythm.Brilliant vision and music, medium story and acting, though Perkins made every tic and stutter count.",Psycho
288,Brian-272,"A classic. Hitchcock's greatest film. Everything is perfectly done and the film has the most famous scene in movie history you know the scene ""The Shower Scene"".",9,4 November 2000,"Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho has it all to start with romance, embezzlement, disappearance, secrets, voyeurism, a dead corpse, a split personality of a man who thinks from time to time he's his dead mother and of course death in the most famous scene of all time the scene of Janet Leigh getting stabbed to death in the shower. The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own. After 40 years and beyond we all still have the right to go a little mad.",Psycho
289,brenttraft,What makes it great,10,9 September 2001,"I normally do not like horror films, but this is a perfect example of how style and craftsmanship can overcome what is basically a mediocre script.The thing that really makes this movie for me is the way it is filmed and the way the music is used throughout the film.  The visual style can compete with ""Vertigo"" as Hitchcock at his most artsy.  SPOILER:  Another innovative technique is leading up to the ""shower scene,"" Janet Leigh is in every scene and almost every shot.  The movie is about her and it is being shown from her point of view.  Then we have the famous ""shower scene"" and suddenly the movie is no longer about her; it is about Norman Bates.  Hitchcock makes this transition with such incredible ease that there is no loss of coherence.This movie is a real work of art.  What is even more incredible is that Hitchcock was able to make something so artsy, yet make it appeal to a wide audience.  That is the tightrope that today's film makers do not seem able to walk.",Psycho
290,rollernerd,Wouldn't even harm a fly,8,15 February 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's Hitchcock movie review is the noir slasher thriller Psycho (1960), which to me is so far one of the most iconic films that not only Alfred Hitchcock made but in American cinema. Quick summary of the film before I go in depth analysis, Marion Crane played by the brilliant Janet Leigh is a woman who is in love with a divorced man, Sam Loomis, who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. So, Crane decides to steal the money of a wealthy customer as an attempt to wipe the debt of her lover and marry him. By stealing the money, Marion leaves her town in a rush to keep the money and finds herself checking in at the Bates motel. There she meets the weird and interesting Norman Bates and there Marion goes missing. With no information on her sister, Lila Crane and Sam go look for Marion along with the help of a Private Inspector.This film is all about the suspense which is executed by its film angles, music score and the composition of the filmmaker's shots. This can be demonstrated with the earliest scenes of the movie, when Marion was leaving town with the money, the angle of the camera switched between her facial expression and the road ahead of. In this segment, the audience can easily tell that the she is worried and panicking about being caught by the law, also by showing the her view we can tell that she is try hard to stay on the road and get further away from her town as she continued to drive in the rain and night. And the music gives the scene a sense of urgency and was played louder when she was near the local police authority. The local police authority in appearance looks like a dark and sinister figure who never takes off his sunglasses and follows Marion. To me this is a great method of someone who seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her.The films main element to me is Bernard Herrmann incredible musical score which just elevates each story within the film in such a way, the effect is hypnotic. The music is literally screaming at you in each scene. From the violent and suspenseful strings to the strings of death, the score just creates a thrilling atmosphere and captured myself really into the story and to what will happen next to the characters, which Hitchcock introduces us in the film.To me the real star of this film other than Janet Leigh is Norman Bates himself, played by Anthony Perkins who always manages to surprise you. From the stolen money plot, we now dive deep into Norman Bates. Whether they are the facial tics or the half-swallowed words, the performance is sensational and Perkins turns Norman Bates into one of the most famous fictional names in film history. Now Norman is a nutcase and you can see this when Norman has his chat with Marion about the hotel, his mother, running away from problems and his hobbies all while you see the taxidermy of animals in the background hanging ominously. Hitchcock deliberately placed the stuffing of animals in the background to emphasize Norman's statement about doing potential harm. Perkins does well with his character by showing us Norman's shyness, his madness, the tenderness, the danger, the cravings of macabre servings all due to being a mamma's boy with hellish implications.The other element is the mystery of Norman's mother, which is revealed towards the ending of this film is a true introduction in the main stream media of split personalities. Once you see the corpse of Mrs Bates, along with the doctor explaining who ""Mother"" is, Hitchcock cleverly helps us to understand what split personality disorder really is. Also for you Snatch fans, look our for periwinkle blue - both flicks had the mother and son dynamic.Overall, this is a great film due to the elements that help to create a suspenseful thriller whether its due to the acting, the writing, the filmmaking, editing or the musical score all without gore. The film is a stroke of genius made by the master himself Hitchcock 8.8/10",Psycho

292,jose-cruz53,Excellent psychological thriller,8,2 October 2012,"That's my current favorite Hitchcock film. Its more of a terror film than a psychological thriller and this is the reason I like it: its the only Hitchcock film that has really managed to scare me. However, I do not consider a film such as this as ""a great film"", simply because I am not the greatest fan of such type of genre. Still, I admit it is a masterpiece of its genre and the fans of such films will certainly love this movie.Also, given it is a very old film, it has some flaws given its obsolete pacing and structure. The story drags a little in the first half of the film and later it seems to be rushed through. Though in a sense this improves the final dramatic shock of the film. The ending is totally ""holy sh*t this is great!"", though I took off two points out of 10 because of its incomplete nature as a film.",Psycho
293,I_Am_The_Taylrus,Shower Scene Did It For Me,10,3 October 2006,"SPOILERSLike I said, the shower scene made the movie for me. The screeching violins in the background of the camera angles in that scene were great. Anyway, I'm here to talk about the film. I love it. Anothony Perkins and Janet Leigh's performance's were spectacular, the suspense in this film was great. It was also very brave to kill off the main character in the first hour. Also, the scene where Norman(Mother)kills the deputy is very scary, being as it feels like you're falling down the stairs. Of course Hitchcock has a cameo in this(he's the one in the cowboy hat outside the office.) The appearance of Mother was frightening, being as she was a corpse. The end of which Norman was thinking in Mother's voice was creepy. The last line in the film is ""She wouldn't even harm a fly."" And when Norman's face morphs into Mother's face was very creepy. That scene looked like the scene in the Exorcist. Anyway, this is a spectacular thriller and should not be missed.10/10 Recommended Films: North by Northwest, Vertigo, Rear Window, and Halloween",Psycho

297,akash_sebastian,Best Psychological Thriller from the Master of Suspense! Pathbreaking for its Time...,8,16 July 2013,"With an age of 60 years, and a book containing such violence and sexuality, when Hitchcock tried to make 'Psycho' in 1959, the people, the industry and the critics didn't expect anything to come out of it. Who could have guessed it would become one of his best and most ambitious works.Personally, it's my favourite Hitchcock movie; it's a powerful and complex psychological thriller. The movie was path-breaking in so many ways, and completely transformed the thriller and mystery genres. Its foray into psychoanalysis, the killing of the leading lady halfway through the film, the voyeuristic camera angles/glimpses into the lives of the characters, and the sexuality on film; all these completely changed the face of cinema. And not to forget John L. Russell's cinematography and Bernard Herrmann's legendary background score which give the movie its tone and impact.Janet Leigh is mesmerizing in her short, but brilliant, portrayal of Marion Crane. Anthony Perkins gives a heartwarming and powerful performance as the innkeeper Norman Bates.How can I finish my review without mentioning the famous Shower sequence? Legend has it that the scene was filmed over 7 days, and features 77 different camera angles. The nudity and violence are merely suggested, and not actually shown, and there lies the actual beauty of the scene. And the shots shown are through the views of the killer and the victim, and not that of a third person. Other than this scene, there are many other memorable and brilliantly directed scenes in the movie, including the climatic twist and the exceptional ending. There are many such details which add to the magnificence of the film.The movie still remains as one of the best suspense thrillers of all time. Hitchcock truly was... the Master of Suspense!",Psycho

It makes glue to my sit and watch the entire movie instead.At the end of the movie, i then realised the mother is already dead and Norman Bates is considered as a person with psychiatric problem who impersonated his mother.

This is quintessential Hitchcock, inspired by the true case of the murderer Ed Gein. Hitch then frankly defied the limits of the already agonizing, though still active Production Code. ""Psycho"" addressed such themes as adultery, homicide, Oedipus Complex, transvestism, mental disorder, exhumed bodies, everything exposed both subtly and graphically. ""Psycho"" introduced us to an antagonist of enormous psychological density; a psychopath with indelible mental disorders whose causes and motives were only fully discovered in the whodunit's climax.",Psycho
301,ragosaal,Hitchcok's Masterpiece,10,27 August 2006,"Psycho starts as a common ""black"" movie with our heroine Marion (Janet Leigh)stealing us$ 40.000 from his boss for sentimental reasons. Her run ends up at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman (Anthony Perkins) and his sick mother. All of a sudden she is smashed to death in the famous shower scene, no more than 40 minutes after that start. Then we realize we have entered in a completely different kind of movie: a sordid Thriller with a surprising ""finale"" much like a horror film. Hitchcock carries the picture perfectly and it makes complete sense at the end. Back in 1960 double personality movies where not common and many appeared after Psycho (Dressed to Kill, as the outstanding example),but none could get even close to the original. Interest is kept all along and the music score is perfect too. As for the cast, it could not be better. Leigh proved for the first time she could really act and did well after Psycho. Vera Miles also grew as an actress after Psycho, and John Gavin was correct (unusual in him). John McIntyre and Martin Balsam make great supporting. As for Perkins there can be no doubt this was his best performance ever; in fact, you could say the film ruined his carrier because whenever you saw him after Psycho you could not help see Norman Bates. But on the other side, the role put him forever in films history. Saying that Psycho is Hitchcok's best picture shows clearly the huge size of this movie coming from a guy that made such classics as Rear Window, Dial M for Murder, North by Northwest and many others.

The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience.

Those strings. And that cinematography.
I realised it's all the little things Hitchcock does that makes him the ""master of suspense"", even in the first act before the Bates Motel is even remotely part of the film, it's still so nail-biting watching Marion make her escape, but when it culminates in THAT scene, christ.
I do feel as though the second act is a little too slow and predictable, however, but the third, and ESPECIALLY that final scene, bring it home so well.

Prior to this, I watched Silence of the Lambs and found it extremely dull (for my taste) and so expected much the same here. I was WRONG!From the first fifteen minutes, the tone of creepiness was playing along mainly due to the creepy musical score. I found the story quite enjoyable. Slowly, as we meet Norman Bates the film starts to feel extremely terrifying and the motel feels a bit like Camp Green Lake from Friday the 13th. The things that were done so well are numerous***ACTING***Acting was terrific especially by Anthony Perkins. He gave the extremely realistic portrayal of who Norman Bates was. All the supporting actors/actresses around him did a great job but Anthony Perkins drove the story along the best!***SCORE***The musical score is the most terrifying thing about this film and adds the extra tension to it. It was superbly done, much like John Carpenter's 1978 Halloween where the musical score is what gave everyone the fright***DIRECTING***Alfred Hitchcock's directing of the film was superb. Many regard this as his best film and even though I have not seen any other Hitchcock film, I can understand why. The pacing, the dialogue, the correct casting and the right plot and characters were handled exceptionally well by Hitchcock. ***STORY***The story here was extremely interesting and made sure you wanted to watch the end of the film. The way the entire story unfolds by the end and the twist it takes was so well done that most film experts wouldn't have guessed it coming.***CHARACTERS***Unlike many stupid slasher films such as Friday the 13th where half the characters are complete jerks and you honestly don't give a s**t what happens, the same does not happen here. Every character has some problem during their life: Sam, Marion and Norman. When characters such as Abergast and Marion die, you feel the certain pity. Overall, this film is exceptional.

All I can say is wow and Alfred Hitchcock shows us why he is one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live with this low-budget 1960 shocker.The beautiful Janet Leigh (whose daughter happens to be Jamie Lee Curtis) plays Marion Crane who is dealing with a boyfriend (John Gavin) whose in need of cash and also the desire to marry this man. Crane is a real-estate secretary and a huge purchase is made in cash. Her job is to take the $40,000 to the bank on her way home. Thing is Marion decides to take the money and drive to her boyfriend in Fairvale. Before she gets there she decides to stop at the Bates Motel for the night. There she meets Norman Bates (amazingly played by Anthony Perkins) and this is where this truly great film gets even better.Janet Leigh garnered an Oscar nomination for her role which she richly deserved as I thought she does an amazing job really in caring the first half an hour of the film as we follow her and only her. The fact that Anthony Perkins did not even receive an Oscar nomination for his multi-layered in-depth portrayal of Norman Bates is beyond mind-blowing to me.The music as well by Bernard Hermann is truly one of the greatest not only in the history of horror, but of all-time films. It has been ripped off, attempted to be duplicated a number of times, but when you hear others be inspired by it you can tell exactly where the music is coming from.Screenplay by Joseph Stefano from a novel (which I have read and did enjoy) by Robert Bloch. Also starring Vera Miles as Marion's sister Lila, Martin Balsam as Arbogast, Simon Oakland as Dr. Richman and look fast for Ted Knight right near the end of the film.In my all-time list of greatest horror films this masterpiece stands only behind Stanley Kubrick's THE SHINING in my mind. There is so much to look at and dissect and go over in your mind. Probably the most influential horror film of all time.Followed by three sequels (all of which were never equal to the original), a TV movie, a yucky shot-for-shot remake and a TV show.",Psycho

The combination works well to provide a movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat but which still has the stillness and conventional look of an old movie.The plot is very simple but provides a frame for an interesting narrative. Hitchcock's excellent photography makes this movie stand out and the casting is spot on with all the characters appearing distinct. I also appreciate that there is not so much over-acting which tends to be the case with many older films and it helps to bring the film a type of soberness but thankfully it doesn't suck the life out of the film like it does with many other films.The film does have a few weaknesses, I've always had a sense that Norman is not as innocent as he appears and the film goes perhaps into too much detail on how he covers up for the murder. The film could have done with less. Also, the psychiatrist at the end hams up the tone of the film just a tad too much and is one of the few things about the film I've never enjoyed.However, over-all Psycho lasts the test of time.",Psycho
313,Toronto85,Psycho,10,12 April 2011,"Psycho is probably my all time favourite horror film next to Halloween (1978) and the original Night of the Living Dead. What this movie managed to do at that time in the 60's was remarkable. There had never been anything like this made up to that point. It's the start of a great sub genre known as the ""slasher film"". The story is of a troubled man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and a woman on the run named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Marion leads an unfulfilled life and one day decides to embezzle $40,000 from her employer. While on the run, she stops off at the infamous Bates Motel to think things over and get some rest. While taking a shower, an unseen assailant who resembles a large woman attacks her with a knife, killing her. We soon are led to believe it's Norman's mother who committed the crime. It's then we see Norman cover it up for her. Many people question the whereabouts of Marion over the next few days including her boyfriend and sister. They, with the help of a private investigator, discover she was at the Bates Motel. But when entering the house up on the hill behind the motel, the discovery they make is much more chilling then could ever be imagined.Psycho is an all time classic by suspense and psychological icon Alfred Hitchcock. This was definitely his best work. The Birds was also excellent as was Rear Window, but this will always be his best known piece - and for good reason. The performances by Perkins and Leigh in particular was very understated and very well done. Watching it the first time, you really are drawn into the story and the mystery of the crimes taking place. Of course, after a few viewings you know the plot and the killer's identity. This is one of those horror movies that never gets old to me and never feels boring. Each time I watch it, I pick up something new. I liked Janet Leigh's character and her struggle with the embezzlement scheme. She knows what she did was wrong and contemplates taking the money back numerous times. It gives her that human quality and makes viewers feel bad for her in the end.The musical score is legendary as well, even if you've never seen Psycho, you know that sharp grating music that goes along with each suspenseful moment. Psycho is a classic horror film, but not just horror. Even the people who hate horror should see this at least once for it's brilliance.10/10",Psycho
314,stevenfallonnyc,"Good, but overrated and unintentionally funny",5,22 July 2007,"""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending. The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.And the ""shocking"" cellar scene almost plays like a comedy skit nowadays. When ""Mother"" is turned around in the chair, what you see just looks too funny not to laugh, and when Norman comes in, combined with his face, the way he was dressed, and the ""Psycho music"" at full bombast, I couldn't help but crack up for ten minutes at the hilarious combination of all this. Sorry to say, what was supposed to be such a frightening scene, is just too comedic to truly scare anymore.It's unreal to think ""Psycho"" was voted one of the scariest films ever made. Who does this movie actually scare?And the cop at the end, with his long-winded speech that sums up the whole picture (conveniently with the rest of the cast sitting and listening intently), is just too blatantly pandering that you just want to say, ""ok, I think we all get it now!"" You almost expect the cop to turn to the crowd in the theater and say, ""ok, does everyone understand now?"" Even the very last shot of Norman is kind of funny, with the expressions he is making. The skull kind of saves the scene, but still.""Psycho"" is still recommended viewing for any old school movie fan, just to see Hitchcock's work. But the challenge is not to laugh at many certain scenes. The ""Making of"" documentary on the DVD is pretty decent (if not somewhat long winded itself) but the omission of deleted or rare scenes is definitely noticed. Janet Leigh is still very sharp though, and still looks great.",Psycho
315,frankwiener,An Unmatched Work by the Master of Suspense,9,8 April 2021,"I was very disturbed to watch a recent discussion of this iconic suspense film by three Turner Classic Movie hosts who are recognized and qualified film scholars. While the entire focus of their discussion was gender identification and violence against women, only two of many important aspects of this work of art, they totally ignored the most essential elements of the film which have compelled me to watch it over and over again for the past 60 years. The film is exceptional because of (1) the overall direction of Alfred Hitchcock and his mastery of the suspense genre, as well as his remarkable ability to tell a story with stunning visual beauty, (2) the magnificent musical score of Bernard Hermann which, by itself, creates a level of tension unlike any other film score in my memory, (3) the superb acting of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in the critical lead roles as well as a few supporting cast members who very much impressed me, including Frank Albertson as the man whose stolen $40,000 sets the wheels rolling for all of the following action, and (4) for me, the startling design of the opening credits by Saul Bass, which, accompanied by Mr. Hermann's spine-chilling music, establishes a high level of uncertainty, if not terror, even before the movie actually begins.Even though I was prohibited from seeing ""Psycho"" at age eleven when it first opened in 1960, I was soon on my way aboard the Number 8 bus to downtown Elizabeth NJ, where I spent many Saturday afternoons watching movies in any one of the city's four theatres. On this occasion, I travelled alone so that there would be no blabbermouth witnesses.Subsequent viewings will never reach the level of terror as that initial session in 1960 when I was scared out of my wits. I will also state that the level of tension and fear established so well by the director in the first half is not sustained by a much less eventful, far less gripping second half.After many viewings, I never tire of the superb performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Although Leigh only appears during the first thirty minutes, she plays a seriously conflicted and even tormented Marion Crane to perfection, especially when Marion is painfully obliged to wear a calm and impassive face to the public. Apparently, Perkins' acting career fell victim to his own success here as his depiction of Norman Bates was so legendary that he could no longer be easily identified by audiences as anyone else.The one major flaw for me is Simon Oakland's awkward and totally unnecessary monologue at the end, which served to spoil an otherwise excellent movie. While I didn't understand a word of it at the age of eleven, it still annoys me more than sixty years later. Norman seated in the padded cell with mother's very creepy voiceover and the superimposition of Mama's hideous image over his face at the last instant doesn't require Oakland's tedious and very confusing explanation at all. A picture says a thousand words if it is presented properly. What makes the ending even worse is the psychiatrist's odd gleefulness as he confirms Marion's tragic fate to Sam and Lila. Although I never allowed this awkward ending to ruin the rest of an extraordinary film, it proves that even Alfred Hitchcock isn't perfect as the pedantic and pompous psychiatrist should have been left on the cutting floor where he belonged.",Psycho
316,JoshtheGiant,A Classic,10,27 December 2005,"Psycho is considered by many critics and audiences as the best horror film ever made. I don't think it is that but it is still impossible to say that it is not a great film and is one of the best horror films ever, maybe top five, but not one. Alfred Hitchcock is on the other hand the best director ever to grace the cinema. He has created some of the best films ever and has never made a bad one. Some of his best are the original The Man Who Knew too Much, Psycho, and North By Northwest. The plot to Psycho is amazing, every thing seems more real than you would expect from this kind of film. The screenplay is also great. With very good characters and dialogue. The screenplay is also very daring doing very new things. The performances are also great. Anthony Perkins in particular is amazing but everyone give great performances. Janet Leigh is probably second best in her Oscar nominated performance. She brings her character to life very well, but Perkins doesn't. He just becomes that character, and that is one of the best performances in history. The visual effects are excellent for the time and would stand up fairly well for today. This is one of Hotchcocks best films and is one to watch over and over and over again.",Psycho
317,krational66,A model of parallel montage shooting,7,7 April 2020,"From the perspective of a thriller, suspense and horror movie, psycho is definitely a success, at least in my eyes.
The plot of the bathroom murder in psycho has long been a classic scene in film history, which was later called the model of using parallel montage. In the entire murder scene, although there is not even a picture of a knife inserted into the body, but through the use of montage techniques, the audience is still scared, to bring the audience a naked thriller. 45 seconds, 78 shots, knife, human body, sprinkler head, curtain, lower water hole, repeatedly switch between the murderer and the murdered quickly, the knife stabbed at the body of the different positions of the group, coupled with the switch between the water in the sprinkler head and the curtain, lower water hole, produced a kind of thriller effect the director is eager to get. As Hitchcock put it: ""the most intense thing is not the disgusting way people die, but the atmosphere that simmers before they die.""
Made up entirely of close-ups and close-ups, the murder scene is fast, fast-paced and powerful, creating an impressive sense of terror and excitement. It's worth noting that there is no dialogue in this scene, only action, expressed on the screen in cinematic language. It is therefore horrifying, frightening and exciting, which is completely conveyed to the audience by the tension and information of the images.",Psycho
318,HelloTexas11,Hitchcock's best,10,30 December 2007,"'Psycho' has long been a favorite of mine, though for a long time I was unable to explain exactly why. It wasn't a horror film, at least not in the way I generally thought of them; there's no monster and there are no supernatural aspects. It fits more into the murder mystery category. But it has the feel of a horror film and of course today is usually regarded as such; in fact, many regard it as the best horror film ever made. Alfred Hitchcock, it seems to me, knew exactly what he wanted 'Psycho' to be and didn't worry about categories. An aura of desperate fear and paranoia permeates the film from start to finish, enveloping all the main characters. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane, in particular, is the very picture of someone on the edge, constantly looking over her shoulder, always afraid of being discovered. Her character is all the more believable because Marion Crane seems like the last person one would expect to behave as she does, stealing $40,000 from the office she works at so that her lover (John Gavin) can pay off his debts and they can be together. It is a rash act for a woman who initially seems like your typical office worker, leading a humdrum existence except for the stolen moments she shares with her lover. But she acts on her dream because she is desperate, and desperation drives her. 'Psycho' is atypical in many ways. For one thing, Crane, who is clearly the focal point of the film, is killed fairly early on. The emphasis then shifts to Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), his mother, and other characters who are trying to determine Crane's whereabouts. Bates seems to acquire Crane's mantle of paranoia, at first certain no one will ever come looking for her and even if they do, will never discover that his 'mother' killed her. Seeming a quirky but harmless momma's boy in his early scenes, Bates is slowly revealed to be insane- the 'psycho' of the title. Shot in black and white on a modest budget, 'Psycho' didn't seem to be anything special upon release. Most critics were less than impressed. But audiences certainly took to it, making it one of Hitchcock's most successful films; it grossed $32,000,000 (a huge sum at the time) and subsequent re-issues and television showings added to that figure. And since then, its reputation has grown with each passing year, with reams of film criticism devoted to it and dissecting it. Regardless of the category one wishes to fit it in, horror/thriller/mystery/crime drama, it has long since passed needing such labels, now simply regarded as Hitchcock's most well-known work, possibly his best, one that regularly makes all kinds of cinema 'top ten' lists for best film ever. Bernard Herrmann is easily as crucial to the movie's success as any of the actors; his music score has become irrevocably linked to key moments in 'Psycho,' the shrieking violins almost a trademark. The infamous 'shower scene' has become a part of pop culture history, discussed and parodied countless times. And Anthony Perkins will rightfully be remembered always as Norman Bates, forever reminding us that ""a boy's best friend is his mother.""",Psycho
319,gcanfield-29727,Hitchcock's masterpiece,10,29 June 2020,"Strictly in terms of horror, there is only one movie I would rate higher than this one. That would be the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Both films were inspired by real life whacko Ed Gein. Psycho is brilliant due to Hitchcock's subtle direction. Janet Leigh sporting only a bra and slip was very much ""pushing the envelope"" in 1960. Then, on to the notorious shower scene, which creates an illusion of nudity, combined with the sheer terror of the scene. Personally, I would have liked Vera Miles better in the Janet Leigh role. Vera was much prettier and infinitely more sexy! Not only do we not see Vera in her underwear, but she never even takes her coat off! Am I going on about Vera Miles? So, I am! Beautiful lady and great actress. As for Anthony Perkins, his great performance speaks for itself. Not much else you can say without giving too much away. The movie also benefits very much from Simon Oakland's appearance as a psychiatrist.",Psycho

Vertigo was one for a while, then I switched to Strangers on a Train, but the pieces add up best in Psycho. If someone has never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie and would like to know why he's so important to cinema, here's a perfect introduction. The music by Bernard Herrmann is one of the most famous songs in the history of music. The scenes are memorable both in what they're about and how they're filmed. The casting is pitch perfect. The story adds up all the way through. The trade marks of Hitchcock are everywhere in this, especially the ""twist ending"", which he invented and never fails to shock me when I watch the picture due to it's realism.",Psycho

322,bbhlthph,What made Hitchcock Unique?,9,28 March 2006,"I do not know which film has attracted the greatest number of IMDb user comments or ratings, but the database for Psycho currently includes a total of 511 comments, and there are 64,372 users who have rated this film at an average of 8.6 - giving it the #23 spot in the all time top 250 films. Hitchcock's Psycho was released in 1960, before most of today's cinema patrons were born, and today it is not often seen either in the few remaining repertory cinemas or even on TV movie channels. Younger viewers will never be able to experience the shock that this film created when first released. Seeing it on a home DVD can give no hint of its original impact in the theatre. In principle one might expect that by now this film would be nothing more than a fading memory for most of today's movie goers, but instead new comments on it are being submitted to IMDb on an ongoing basis and major film reviewers also continue to discuss it in numerous other publications. Such facts probably tell us all that we need to know about Psycho; but, even if they do not, there can be very little left to say to add to the 511 comments already published by IMDb.Although I originally had no intention of adding any comments, I have gradually become forced to change my mind by the flood of copies, near copies and look alike films that attempt in one way or another to trade on the reputation of Hitchcock's masterpiece. We have an almost shot for shot remake with the same title (1998), as well as Psycho II (1983), Psycho III 1986, Psycho IV (1990), and American Psycho (2000). In total IMDb now lists 97 films with Psycho in their title and many of these clearly hope to exploit the reputation of this 1960 film in one way or another. There are others which also exploit it, sometimes even more blatantly, without trading on its actual title; even though they may be released with titles such as The Psychopath or Psychotic. It is difficult to comment meaningfully on most of these films before my comments on Hitchcock's original are on record, so here goes: Firstly I must take issue with those who imply that Hitchcock was the originator of horror films per se, or even that he was the first director who understood how to use a movie camera to create horror, suspense and tension. If you really believe this, go back and carefully look again at the early masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) in which the use of many techniques later so effectively exploited by Hitchcock can be found. Although Hitchcock actually directed one film in 1914, long before Dr Caligari was released, only part of this survives; and even his greatest fans would find it difficult to claim him precedence in the exploitation of these techniques. Hitchcock success was due to his mastery of cinematographic imagery combined with a very adept hand in using whatever technological or artistic developments were available to the maximum advantage. Most of his early work was carried out in the period when colour stock was not readily available or was very expensive and potentially unreliable. Until his reputation as a director was firmly established, Hitchcock was not free to make his films in colour and most of his early ones were shot in monochrome. But before he created Psycho he had filmed a long string of successes, in full colour, starting I believe with the period drama Under Capricorn in 1949. He had also experimented with one important film released in 3D format (Dial M for murder), and his choice of monochrome for Psycho was clearly made because he believed that it would be artistically more effective made in this way. This judgement was so accurate that even today when every movie goer has some familiarity with the story, it is almost universally agreed the visual impact from watching Psycho is far greater than that from a whole library of more recently made horror films.Psycho did not however become the classic it is simply because it is a very effective horror film. The horrors of World War II and the fears associated with the development of the atomic bomb provided more than enough material to occupy most movie makers during the period immediately before 1960, but these horrors remained remote from everyday life in normal North American communities. Hitchcocks genius probably lay primarily in recognising this, and becoming the first major filmmaker to exploit the horrors that result when individuals with normally insipid personalities undergo some experience or trauma that leads them to behave in ways which those who know them can neither understand or comprehend. To see a Hitchcock film generally involves not viewing in a detached way what might happen in some remote and hazardous locale far away from home, but watching with mounting horror what might easily occur in ones own home community in the not too distant future. There are more and more directors who try to make horror films today, but unfortunately very few of them even understand this is why Hitchcock's films remain so much superior to their own.Hitchcock has frequently met well justified criticism for unduly cavalier treatment of the novels that he filmed - he regarded a novel as no more than a framework on which to hang an often very different story created in a different medium, and for this reason his films often irritated readers of well loved books such as Buchan's ""The ThirtyNine Steps"". Although this may also apply to Psycho, we should consider how many readers today would be familiar with the works of Robert Bloch if his novel had not been filmed by Hitchcock?",Psycho
323,coolantic,Never Mind The Shower Scene!,10,9 January 2021,"Forget the two famous murders in this movie.

324,PCC0921,"Cutting Edge Hitchcock, No Pun Intended",8,14 January 2021,"Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense, gives us an amazing dose of chills and creates a few more Hollywood icons, when he introduces the world to Norman Bates.Hitchcock always was a man who wanted to do things different than other directors. He always said show the audience what will happen. If there is a bomb under the table, then show them the bomb. He wasn't afraid to take chances doing things to main characters that were untraditional at the time. In the case of Psycho he delivers that with a punch.A young woman (Janet Leigh), who comes into a lot of money, leaves town and ends up off the beaten path at a quiet, but intimidating little motel for the night. She meets Norman (Anthony Perkins), the motel owner and his ""mother"", a woman who she never sees, but knows that she is Mrs. Bates, because she hears conversations with her son from their house at the top of the menacing hill. What happens after that is film history.For those of you silly enough to have never seen Psycho, that is all I am going to say. Hitchcock uses all his camera techniques, use of light, use of sound and brilliant story-telling to create a tension and suspense that knocks you for a loop, especially midway through the film when his brilliance shows us why he never was a traditional auteur and enjoyed crossing the line.8.8 (B+ MyGrade) = 8 IMDB",Psycho

She performs realistically and she is beautiful and radiant. The story of a young woman in love, who gets her hand on some money and wants to be better off in life with her lover. The scenes with her and the cop were absolutely thrilling. I was expecting the cop to search her bag and bring her to justice. The shower scene in the hotel room is a classic. How many films we know have tried to copy it!! And the scene which was shot from her eye was haunting.Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates was absolutely wonderful and terrifying in the end. He made me care for his character who was under his mother's subjugation and did what any son who loves his mother would do (atleast, to him it was true. I would have been scared out of my mind).Also, the little things in the movie do count. Milton Arbogast as the private detective, I wanted him to leave Bates alone as Norman was such an understandable character. Hitchcock delivers horror in a movie which has no gore. I never thought this old movie could be this awesome. I mean, the score was chilling and its still used today with all kinds of variations. This is the one of the films which spawned every horror filmmaker out there to follow the footsteps of Hitchcock and be as great as him (unfortunately, there are only a few).Words don't do justice to this movie. Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. He is brilliant by making the climax so scary. I really didn't see the ending coming. It was sheer brilliance on the part of Hitchcock. We still got films that have the same theme recycled over and over again. But, nothing is as good as the original. As they say, ""old is gold"" (I never thought I would say that). Hitchcock's decision to make this in black and white is impressive as it is more scary without the colours.Do yourselves a favour and make your kids watch this film before they can get brainwashed into thinking today's horror films are scary.

328,karl_consiglio,Flawless,10,22 October 2006,"A groundbreaking film from beginning to end even by today's standards. Psycho has been reviewed over and over in Film schools and Universities and with very good reason. Alfred Hitchcock was a savage stuffed bird genius. He was so very inventive, courageously creative and true to his cause. He was so ahead of his time. Psycho has no clichés, on the contrary it broke boundaries and crushed all sorts of taboos in film making. Apart from shocking this film must have been downright scandalous too. This film is great from all angles. Starts with Janet Leigh fleeing the city with the stolen cash like an escaped canary to freedom or the unknown dangers outside. Hitchcock was obsessed with birds and totally inspired by them, yes hence the movie 'The Birds'. The suspense in Psycho is superb. We are constantly at the edge of our seats and what comes to us is way beyond our expectations and imagination. Anthony Perkins was perfect for the role which was to follow him for the rest of his days. He even had the right shape for this part and that is were I think they failed the most in trying to remake this film, it was a small but very effective detail, they did not take into consideration the shape of this man Hitchcock had chosen. Hitchcock was also the first as far as I know to ever slash our starring attractive blonde actress to pieces in the middle of the movie and sending the film off into another direction with our suspense at its peak. The shower scene is an all time classic that must have downright shocked the audience at the time because even watching it today will keep you with it imprinted in your memory forever, no matter what we are used to seeing on our screens today. The irony in those shots is that as they were being shot Hitchcock is going ""cut"" ""cut"" ""cut"".....That knife is the beak of a bird of prey.

It has been more than 50 years now when this Hitchocokian piece of amazing cinematic experience was first shown to the world and it has not dated at all. A chilling story, watertight screenplay, detailed narration, solid acting, subtle conversations and on top of it the magical touch of Alfred Hitchcock. Hitchcock did not need gore or violence to spook you, he did it with just creating the creepy atmosphere and giving you scares at the right moments. Janet Leigh as the victim of its own actions and Anthony Perkins as the mysterious guy give you chills now and then. There is hardly any unwanted scene and Hitchcock makes you root for all characters including the evil ones. I am going with fantastic 8 out of 10 for Psycho.

330,Artimidor,"""Psycho"" spells the ABC of horror",10,3 April 2012,"The face of Anthony Perkins aka Norman Bates as the psycho has burned itself deep into the mindset of moviegoers since Hitchcock's horror thriller hit the silver screens in 1960. It's essential for a whole genre, as iconic and unmistakable as Boris Karloff's Frankenstein monster in Jack Pierce's make-up and will be for many more generations to come. As far as horror movies go it can't get any better than this. Anthony Perkins remains stuck in your mind due to his nervously shy performance throughout most of the film, likable and odd at the same time, and the ice cold twist at the end makes perfect sense.But the film is much more than Perkins. It's Robert Bloch's excellent script, Bernard Herrmann outstanding score, and then there's the director. Hitch shows his handwriting as the master of suspense in every detail. The black and white cinematography of course is crucial and used to perfection in ""Psycho"", the shadows and tilted angles contribute to an unnerving atmosphere. And who else would get rid of someone introduced as the protagonist after a third of the film? Or take the famous shower scene, where the master demonstrates his cutting edge editing abilities, literally. It's reduced to the necessary minimum, artistically composed for maximum effect.

331,shepardjessica-1,"Hitchcock's ""Crazy"" Film!",10,16 May 2005,"One of my favorites and I think Hitchcock's best film. Made relatively low-budget with his TV-show crew, this movie has haunted me for years and not because of the shower scene. Actually, the best scene is just prior to the shower scene and it's in the parlor with Norman and Marion. The only human connection moment in the film that doesn't show selfishness or ulterior motives. Quiet and full of info, as the camera looms over them, this scene is masterful in writing and acting. Perkins gave his best performance as the timid and lonely Mr. Bates who really is clueless. Janet Leigh is perfectly cast as the sexy, intelligent woman in over her head. The rest of the cast is top-notch and this film should have cleaned up at the Oscars in '60, but was considered too creepy for most folks.A 10 out of 10. Best performance = Perkins. Brilliant editing and cinematography (b/w) with The Bates Motel a wonderful set. This film is highly undervalued and I don't consider it a horror film. Dashed illusions, loss of essence, and money-will-fix-it attitude while suspicions fly all over the place. Great stuff!",Psycho

335,gregorycanfield,Go take a shower!,10,16 July 2021,"Hitchcock's greatest film and, arguably, the most highly regarded horror movie of all time. Janet Leigh's initial appearance, in her bra and slip, was as risque as any mainstream movie could be in 1960. The immorality of Leigh's character is established right off the bat. Well, maybe. Depends on your point of view. The legendary shower scene was brilliant. The ""illusion"" of nudity is all there was. Janet Leigh was very sexy in the two ""bra and slip"" scenes. However, Vera Miles, in my opinion, was even more sexy-and she never even removes her coat! I guess it's the way a woman comes across. As to Anthony Perkins' performance-he was made for the role. I've never thought the ""twist"" ending was so hard to see coming. Only the genius of Hitchcock could have made everything tie together so well. I rate this film the second best horror movie of all time. My choice for number one came about 14 years later, and was based in Texas.",Psycho
336,Slarkshark,I Wouldn't Recommend Staying at the Bates Motel,9,25 April 2021,"As a self proclaimed cinephile, I'm ashamed that there are some classics I have yet to see. 'Psycho' was one of them, but not anymore!The lead up to Marion Crane arriving at the Bates Hotel was alright, but once she arrives and Norman comes on screen the movie really takes off. After watching the whole thing it was very clear why it's so iconic as a thriller/horror. The music is piercing and really makes those certain scenes unforgettable.I'm sure there have been many character analyses that would not actually deem Norman as a psycho. Nevertheless, he's for sure messed up and it made for a great flick.",Psycho
337,ryan_kuhn,"""A Boy's Best Friend Is His Mother...""",9,13 February 2005,"Psycho is an exercise in bait-and-switch by the maestro of playing an audience, director Alfred Hitchcock. What begins as a story about someone stealing money becomes one about murder in a seedy motel shower. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary who is supposed to deposit a huge sum of money, but instead takes it and leaves Phoenix, Arizona, headed towards California. Along the way, she is shadowed by a cop (the classic Hitchcockian theme of distrust towards police) and finds her way to a rundown motel off the old highway, The Bates Motel. Running the once popular, now with ""12 cabins, 12 vacancies"" motel is Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins in wonderful manic weirdness. You know something is askew with young Norman in the very first scenes we see him, but we can't quite put our finger on it. Is it his stuffed bird collection? Is it how he talks about his mother? Is it the way he communicates to Marion Crane in their uncomfortable conversations they have? It's probably the combination of all of the above, but whatever it is, Perkins portrays Bates in such a manner that we know something is wrong with him. In perhaps the most famous scene in movie history, the switch to the money is made. The star of the film, the Marion Crane character is killed off while taking a shower by Norman Bates' mother in brutal fashion. We the audience think we see a lot more than we actually do, if you look at the scene carefully. The scene is 45 seconds long, but features over 90 individual cuts and camera angles, leading to a manic and desperate moment in the movie. The music during the scene, almost as famous as the scene itself, is cutting with the violins, replicating the action in the scene itself. The shower scene in Psycho is pure movie making, showing the audience what the director wants them to see, and in what he hides leaves the viewer to imagine, and sometimes think they saw what they think they saw. The rest of the film plays as an investigative film, as Marion's loved ones try to piece together what happened after she ran off with the money. The star of the second half of the film is Norman Bates as he tries to cover up the murder by his mother, and his paranoid ways really show up during this period. The film benefits from being shot in black and white and the violin-only musical score adds much more depth to the mood of the film. Made for less than a million dollars, Psycho is also an example of what a director can do for cheap. This movie touched a nerve with the movie-going public, as many people feared taking showers for months after seeing Psycho. It has been said that star Janet Leigh still, to this day, has never taken a shower since filming Psycho.",Psycho
338,PCT1970,He Wouldn't Even Hurt A Fly,9,8 May 2019,"Hitchcock's best film. A masterpiece of it's genre. Excellent direction, screenplay, cinematography, score and acting. The plot revolves around a secretary who steals are large sum of money and hits the road on the lamb. She avoids police by taking back roads which lands her at the run down Bates Motel. Once there she encounters the curiously weird proprietor Norman. From that point the thrills and chills begin. The plot is chilling, creepy, dark, horrific and has a one of a kind fantastic twist ending. The film has many creepy scenes and the shower scene is still spine tingling and timeless. Anthony Perkin's stare and monologue at the end of the film is ingrained in my memory decades after I first started back into it. Both remain two of the most horrific moments ever captured on film. This is a masterful work of art and still evokes screams and terrible dreams from first time viewers. It remains one of the very best films ever in it's genre.",Psycho
339,patrick_dunne,10 reasons to like Psycho,10,25 October 2005,"Sometimes a film will make you fall of your seat laughing. Maybe it will shock you beyond belief. Or, it could make you weep. These are all reasons to love movies. But, what really makes a movie great is the fact that it has more than just on good point. Psycho has many great points.1) The story takes many twists and turns. It seems to change a bit after every set of minutes. The ending is the biggest twist of all. Psycho is nearly unpredictable.2) Perkins performance alone is deserving of an Oscar. We see him twitch and tremble as Arbogast interviews him. He slowly becomes mistrustful and dramatic as he talks with Marion. Anthony Perkin's performance in here deserves to be ranked among the ""Best Male Performances of All Time!"" along with Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.3) Hitchcock knew how to work a camera! His creative style brings the film to life. He films on top of the car hood to see Marion and her stalker in the beginning. The camera spirals backwards, using Marion's eye as the starting point after the shower scene. During the staircase scene, there is a stunning bird's eye view so we can see the killer and Arbogast.4) The dialogue is fun and smart. How unforgettable is ""We all go a little mad sometimes""? It will keep you entertained and thrilled to hear. Even if the film is full of dialogue, it manages to keep you interested.5) Do you know how much Hitchcock worked on this film? I heard the shower scene took days to film! Think about all those shots! Good thing it was all worth it, because the shower scene is one of the best parts of the film.6) Another small, but genius part in Psycho was the part in the cellar. Lila Crane accidentally falls backwards and hits the light bulb, causing it to swing back and forth, to create a spectacular lighting effect.7) The musical score is one-of-a-kind. I hear it re-playing in my head all the time. It's often parodied in shows and other movies. But, don't listen to them. The best music is in the opening credits.8) The murder scenes are visually fantastic. The staircase scene brings sickening pleasure to the mind.9) The voices we hear when Marion is driving away explain what's happening back at her hometown. This saves screen time and allows the story to continue without wasting precious time.10) The ""main character"" Marion is killed off right after the infamous shower scene. I guess she really isn't the main character, (Norman is.) but it makes a fun twist, and the story still continues to flow.Multiple things like this define a movie. So what if it isn't scary? Psycho is a one-of-a-kind film. It's THE Psycho. It's THE movie. It will forever remain timeless.10/10",Psycho
340,arthurclay,Hitchcock's most famous film,10,14 June 2005,"Loosely based on the real life serial killer Ed Gein ""Psycho"" is considered by many to be the best horror movie ever. Janet Leigh supplies the best death scene ever and Anthony Perkins supplies the most twisted sick crazed character ever. Norman Bates (Perkins) is a simple yet somehow complex man who runs the Bates Motel. When a beautiful young woman ends up at his place of business after stealing from a client and on her way to meet her fiancée to be, he proceeds to give her supper and tell her about ""mother"". A film known for the infamous shower scene and of course the ultimate twist ending. Hitchock even received an angry letter from a woman whose child would no longer take a shower after watching this film. Hitchcock pointedly asked her why she would let such a young child watch his film? A staple of the American horror genre and the top five best horror film winner.",Psycho

I think it is still a classic. Janet Leigh puts in a really good performance as someone who has stolen from her boss and looking to run away. The shower scene I think still has the power to shock it was crazy to consider killing off a main character so early. The real star of the film is of course Norman Bates played chillingly and charmingly by Anthony Perkins. He is the young loner who owns the bates motel, says he lives with his mother. The score by Bernard Hermann is one of the great scores in movies. The film is really suspensful if you have not seen it before.

345,Mike-DD,A different kind of fear,10,17 August 2000,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 masterpiece does not instill fear in you like the modern horror flicks (using shock tactics), but instead subtly introduces it to you throughout the film. This might be because of the industry rules at that time as well, since violence that is too overt wasn't tolerated then. But only Hitchcock can use the rules then to construct a masterpiece, that even now, can cause that lingering fear to creep up on you.I enjoyed the Norman Bates portrayed by Perkins - he is the original and will always be the best Norman Bates there is. The use of 'scary' imagery - spooky house on  top of a hill sihouletted by lightning behind, etc...some call it crude, but in Hitchcock's hands, it is dynamite.Rent it if you've never watched the original (you haven't?!?!), you won't regret it.",Psycho

The film's story first introduces Marion Crane, but eventually leads to the Bates Motel, which acts as a vortex that sucks a host of characters in.Anthony Perkins gives an unforgettable nuanced performance as Norman Bates, and develops the character expertly with stutters and expressions as well as dialogue. Janet Leigh is equal to giving a critical performance as the anxious Marion Crane, who carries the first part of the film. The performances of Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and the supporting cast are also solid.Other than some brief pauses, this film consistently has heart-throbbing tension. Bernard Herrmann's famous score is an important contributing factor in the near constant tension.

349,danielll_rs,Check in. Relax. Take a shower...,10,24 September 2000,"PSYCHO (1960)-- Grade: A+WARNING: YOU MAY FIND SOME SPOILERS AHEADIt's amazing how some films are kind of icons not only for a decade, but forever. If you don't go to the movies just for fun, answer me: what is the first name that comes to your mind when someone talks about suspense/mystery films? FRIDAY THE 13TH? No. SCREAM? No. Wes Craven? No. John Carpenter? No. Brian De Palma? No. Of course the answer would be ""Alfred Hitchcock"", if you really like cinema. Hitch is an unanimity today among film critics even more than 20 years after his death, something that never happened even with Kubrick and Buñuel, for example. Not every film of his is a masterpiece, but at least one is an unquestionable classic, an icon when you think about suspense films: PSYCHO. It was released in 1960, shocking audiences and slowly becoming a classic. Considered by the American Film Institute the 18th best film ever and being one of the most well-known pictures of the American cinema, it was obviously ripped-off lots of times, even remade by Gus Van Sant in 1998 scene by scene. But, in opposite of what we would expect, it never became stale. It's still the same PSYCHO, an unique, chilling, spectacular work of art that entertains audiences and makes them think. A masterpiece!It's amazing how this film still remains unique 40 years after its release. Every generation enjoys it, every person who watches it for the first time has a strong opinion about it, it is always a good subject for talking. Some of the most remarkable moments of the cinema are on PSYCHO, at least one: a shower scene. But first let's get back to the beginning of the story. Marion Crane works as a secretary and her boss gives her a huge amount of money to deposit. Her boyfriend has to pay some debts and they want to live together without trouble. As the smart girl she is, Marion decides to run away with the money. She knows she is doing something wrong, so she changes her car and keep going on the road. On a rainy night, she realizes that is difficult to drive more and decides to stop at a motel she doesn't know: the decadent Bates Motel (""12 cabins, 12 vacancies""). There, Marion is received by a young man named Norman Bates, the motel owner, and checks in. He invites her to come to dinner, but Marion hears the voice of Norman's mother, who refuses to let the girl enter at her house. He takes to her a small dinner on his office and they talk a little. Norman lets to know that his mother is invalid and was involved in a tragedy on the past, and he works with dead birds. He seems to be an insecure person because of his mother attitudes. They finish to talk and Marion goes to her room in order to have a shower. That seems to be a calm place, uh? Well, Marion is taking shower and... you know what happens... Poor girl! Norman gets disturbed with the fact and hides Marion's car with her body (and the money) on the swamp. Some days later, Lila Crane, Marion's sister, and Sam Loomis, Marion's boyfriend, are searching for her. A private detective, named Arborgast, will appear to help them. The secret they will find out involving the insecure boy and his mean mother is something very, very weird.With an unusual story, Hitch made the one that is the best film of his brilliant career, along with VERTIGO. The story of PSYCHO could turn into a mess, but the screenplay is perfectly written, with all the ingredients to surprise and scare us. At the screen, what we see is even better. Not one disposable scene, great situations, involving characters. And Hitch... it is not even needed to say. Helped by a wonderful cinematography and Bernard Herrman's chilling, unforgettable score, his camera takes and the angles he uses are just brilliant! The two murder scenes are just perfect, especially the one in the shower, which I don't need to say that is one of the 3 most well-known scenes of the American cinema, and also one of the 3 best, scariest etc. Oh! And the actors! Who could think that Janet Leigh would be killed on the first half? And who could think Anthony Perkins was such a mad guy? The conclusion goes to the right way, being smart and haunting.I could write all my impressions about PSYCHO, but I don't want to take this much longer. It is one of the films that most influences the American cinema of our days. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. And that's it.
To finish, I just wanted to make a parallel between a scene in PSYCHO and a similar one in Brian De Palma's DRESSED TO KILL, obviously influenced by it. When they sum up the crime in PSYCHO, the police officer say that Marion Crane was kind of an alert for the mother to show up into Norman Bates-- the rigid mother who wanted her son only for her. In DRESSED TO KILL (you may think I'm a perverted), Kate Miller and Liz Blake were alerts for the psychiatrist's male side to show up. He wanted to change his sex, but they were obstacles to him because he got ""excited"" with them. I don't know why I'm writing that... That's interesting, but forget!",Psycho
350,Ibuk,The one that started it all,10,8 November 2008,"When released in 1960 Psycho's impact on the horror genre was so great that 48 years later filmmakers still seem to be influenced. Psycho inspired movies like Halloween,Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street,Child'd play and many more. When I watched it for the first time a couple of months I was worried that I wouldn't appreciate it seeing as the twist is widely known. Despite knowing the twist it was still shocking and I throughly enjoyed it. The scene in which they find out the truth about Norman Bates mother still disturbs me. The star of the movie has to be Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance was outstanding, especially in the scene in which he almost shows his true colours. Psycho is a true gem and in my opinion has made a valuable contribution to the horror genre. Absolutely unmissable.",Psycho
351,dataconflossmoor,I promise to use Tilex!!!,10,10 December 2007,"We all know what is synonymous with this movie, the famous shower scene!! In addition to all of the macabre details that this film so brilliantly portrays, ""Psycho"" brought on an introductory revelation to the American movie viewer about schizophrenia!! If you have seen this movie, I am not sure if you remember seeing Alfred Hitchcock in it! One of the office scenes he was standing outside!! It is a fact that in all of Alfred Hitchcock's movies that he made a cameo appearance in each and every one of them!! This gave the movie a little bit of a mystique about the direction it was going in!! A director feels that he must have a gimmick to acquire a popularity with the movie audience!! The film ""Psycho"" evokes an eerie genre to the entire make-up of the movie!! Personal problems become a potpourri of predicaments with all of the major characters in the film, Remaining impervious to the thought patterns of a psychotic serial killer gives way to the potential of artistic creativity!! The complexity of emotions in this movie wound up captivating the American public!! Any enormously classic scene in a film, makes this film a masterpiece of the American cinema!! ""Psycho"" ""North By Northwest"" and ""The Birds"" all had classic scenes which endeared millions to these three Hitchcock films!! 1960 was a year for change in America on so many dimensional playing fields... Start with the fact that that was the year that I was born, I do not think that the world was quite ready for me!! I still have my doubts about that one actually!!! 1960 was the year ""Psycho"" made it's debut, and it is considered by virtually every movie expert to be one of the greatest films ever made!!

352,tequila101,A Classic that should never have been touched,8,30 July 2010,"Well first of all, I liked to say that the Psycho remake was a lovely piece of garbage and that Alfred Hitchcock's original should have never been touched.When Alfred Hitchcock made this film just over 30 years ago, it was a huge hit with anyone. Not my most favorite horror film ever though this was a classic masterpiece that should not have been touched afterwards.The music is greatly chilling, the surroundings that are among us in this film are just sensational and then the ending of seeing Norman Bate's dead mother really left me in suspense. There where no negatives about this film. I'm just giving everyone advice about the remake. Watch it once, and then never ever watch it again because it is full of crap. The remake has no original ideas and it just copies straight out of the Original, though with no suspense.I think this is a great horror movie and also it's a lovely display and probably Hitchcock's best film made. This film is also a good one to watch over and over again because when Alfred Hitchcock created this film, it started the Slasher Genere off really well. To me the Original Psycho later on created other great slasher flicks like ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" & ""Halloween"".8/10",Psycho
353,llihilloh,This is what good movies are all about.,10,25 November 2000,"This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created. Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone. Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever. The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard. Great job to the music composers and to Hitchcock for this scary addition to the movie. I think it's safe to say that everybody has heard of Psycho, but not everyone has seen it. For those of you who still haven't seen this amazing flick, go see it! It's a must see.",Psycho

Psycho was filmed ages ago, and we have to watch it with with a mindset of someone who lived in the 1960's.But, the story is so pedestrian, there is no suspense, no horror, nothing... To be honest, Psycho is a pretty boring film. Compared too Psycho, ""Plan 9 from Outer Space"" is gold, because at least it is fun/funny (intentionally or not!)And what about the shower scene?

357,caseynicholson,A Great Hitchcock Suspense Film,9,14 August 2016,"Let me begin by saying that I grew up in the 80's, meaning that I am of the generation that was reared in the age of ""Friday the 13th"", ""A Nightmare of Elm Street"", and ""Halloween"". Those ""slasher"" films as they're often called set the stage for later horror flicks the likes of ""Scream"" and ""I Know What You Did Last Summer"", along with a slew of other more modern horror films that follow in the legacy of movies with very intense villains.The first time I saw ""Psycho"" was around five years ago, and I had heard that it was the prototype of all of the above modern horror movies that I'd grown to love from my adolescence. I was quite let down, as this film is far from a Freddie, Jason, or Michael type of movie. Instead, this film is a ""horror"" film of a different time and era--the era in which Alfred Hitchcock was synonymous with the genre. And, inasmuch as that's true, ""Psycho"" has an altogether different feel than any of the post-""Exorcist"" or post-""Halloween"" horror films which have come to be more popular nowadays. Another way of putting it might be that this movie may rightly be considered a ""horror"" movie, but it's not really a ""scary"" movie by today's standards. Creepy at points? Yes. Scary? No.That said, I gave this movie a second chance today at a screening at a local historic theater. This time I went into it expecting a Hitchcock movie rather than a modern horror film--and I was not let down. Expectation is everything when it comes to what you get out of a movie, and when before I went hoping for an introduction to a gruesome killer the likes of Michael Myers, I left feeling like I'd been ripped off. But when I watched this movie knowing what to expect--a film high on suspense, with a psychopath as the main villain, albeit one that is a bit cheesy by today's standards--I found myself thoroughly enjoying this movie.I don't think I'm alone in feeling that this film has lost its horrific element in light of modern horror story telling. At one of the most climactic parts of the film (not the well known shower scene, but rather the climax involving Mrs. Bates later on toward the end of the movie), everyone in the theater literally laughed out loud. Perhaps not robustly, but still--the audience's reaction to a scene that was meant to be grotesque was laughter. That's how cheesy parts of this film can be by 2016 standards.And yet, still, when you watch the film for what it is--a suspense filled Hitchcock movie which deals with concepts of ethics and karma, along with the story of a hermit turned psychopath, this is an extraordinary movie. Two of the things that I like most about the film are the great camera work and its score. The movie is in black and white, but its picture quality is sharp (I saw it in digital projection), and the cinematography is as good as any ever put on the silver screen. And that theme song! The violins rushing this way and that--definitely one of the movie's best attributes.All that said, I'm giving ""Psycho"" a score of 9/10 stars, which is much higher than I would have given it when I expected a more modern touch, and indeed much higher than I imagined myself giving the movie when I walked into the theater. Perhaps the only thing making this movie fall just short of a 10/10 is that there are a few little plot holes that seem somewhat obvious if you think things through for a moment--but I won't go into those as it would require spoiling some things. The point is that this is a great movie, so long as you know what kind of vibe to expect. I highly recommend it--just know that you're watching a suspense filled Hitchcock movie, not a modern day horror film.",Psycho
358,minister_of_silly_walks,Hands down the greatest horror movie ever made,10,15 November 2018,Psycho is more terrifying than any slasher flick in existence. Hitchcock shines as the master of suspense in his masterpiece which has found a place in pop culture and is groundbreaking for numerous reasons. A must watch for every horror and cinema fan in general.,Psycho
359,f-57307,great!!!,9,4 April 2020,"The details are handled quite delicately, especially the contrast between the mother's room and the son's room. This film's use of several personalities and post-crime psychological trauma has a great impact on later generations. One episode of criminal psychology is also a murderous son who keeps his mother's remains until moldy.",Psycho
360,C22Man,Triumph of Fear,10,16 July 2016,"What is so striking about Psycho is how much it differs from Hitchcock's usual stylish thrillers, even in his bleaker work like 'Vertigo'. Made with his TV crew, on a small budget and shot in black and white, the film shares more characteristics with noir and pulp than it does with his grand suspense pieces. In saying that, the film still delivers everything you would expect it to and more. It contains some of the most iconic imagery, characters and shocks ever put on screen. Being more terrifying than it had any right to be. It's Hitchcock holding the audience in the palm of his hand. And now it feels as if every important aspect of the film has become a big part of pop culture. The best word to describe the film is unnerving. From the moment the plot is set in motion the sense of dread never lets up. Said plot involves Marion Crane, a secretary who steals $40,000 from a slimy customer and leaves town. We get some insight into her actions, mainly her lover Sam having to pay his ex-wife alimony and their inability to marry as a result. It's a classic Hitchcock theme of a normal person caught up in crime. Marion isn't a bad person, just one forced to do something morally wrong which she later regrets. She stops off at the deserted Bates Motel and seems to get along with the quirky but seemingly pleasant owner Norman, which includes a fascinating dialogue scene in his parlour. However, the film turns on its head, as one event completely changes what we thought the film was initially about into something else entirely. Hitchcock's idea to kill off the leading lady barely halfway through proved to be a brave and ultimately inspired decision. It's a genius choice because it keeps the tension raised throughout. We know that if a main character can be axed off then surely nobody is safe. It is this thought process that provides the suspenseful moments with an added punch that makes them memorable and even more unsettling. They keep us constantly checking over each frame, afraid that anything might leap from the shadows and strike a killer blow. Playing with the audience's uncertainty and understanding just how powerful the feeling of unease can be. Bernard Herrmann's chilling, pulsating score weaves in and out of these scenes, adding even more layers of tension. Despite becoming famous for its sudden violence and shocks, the film has only a few moments that rely on startling the audience. Yet because these moments aren't overused they retain the fear factor. You see very little blood or wounds or gore that is usually associated with the genre. Most of the scares come from the imagery used and the way tension is built. A good example being the highway policeman who seemingly stalks Marion, with dark sunglasses leaving his face expressionless. The scene at the car dealership is truly frightening, the way in which he simply stares at her from across the street. It's pretty amazing how so much discomfort can be built from not only something so simple but someone who is meant to be a figure of good. He represents Marion's last chance to confess her crime, which would have ultimately saved her life. It shows how much we're invested in Marion's dilemma that we are terrified of her being caught.What always amazes me is just how well paced and executed the whole film is. There are long passages with minimal dialogue or plot development, where events play themselves out slowly and cautiously. And they remain effortlessly gripping throughout. A good example is Norman disposing of the body. Who'd of thought that a ten minute long sequence of cleaning up a murder scene could be so riveting? The film is deliberately sparse in that sense. A lot of time is devoted to building up the atmosphere and tension, giving us a feel of the characters and the environment that everything is taking place in. However, the dialogue heavy moments are just as engrossing. Any time Bates opens his mouth you can guarantee that something interesting will come out. The tense scene of him being grilled by detective Arbogast is a good example of that.You have Hitchcock's typical blondes in Janet Leigh as the reserved Marion and Vera Miles as her more inquisitive sister, both elegant and enjoyable to watch. But the truly fascinating character is definitely Norman Bates. What a wonderfully deranged individual. A man who appears to be controlled by his mother. You can tell instantly that something is not right with him. His quirky demeanour hides something disturbed lurking below. A great deal of that is down to Anthony Perkins superb performance. The things he captures complete the character, the way he moves, stammers, smiles, defends his mother, it's all perfectly done. This film very much becomes Norman's story, his actions are what keeps the plot moving forward. He ultimately becomes the character that everyone remembers.So what ends up making Psycho so memorable? I personally think it is down to how competently made and detailed it is. Hitchcock did something that many films of its ilk miss out on completely, he made the story, characters and scares all hold equal importance. The story is weaved perfectly, which in turn makes us feel something for the characters, and leads to the horror being so much more impactful. It is also the ultimate example of why atmosphere and tension will always beat gore and shock value on the scare scale. This is Hitchcock at the peak of his powers, working with a crew and cast that excel in every area and adding his own faultless direction to the mix. As a result it remains as powerful, gripping and terrifying as it has ever been.",Psycho
361,Mikew3001,A timeless scare!,10,25 January 2002,"I saw ""Psycho"" the first time as a teenager more than twenty years ago and was scared to death. Though this b/w psycho thriller was nearly 20 years old at that time and it was the high time for splatter and zombie movies with much more graphic violence, this movie used to scare me more than any fashionable slasher film. Everything from the heroine's escape, the dark Bates' house, the murder scenes (especially the one in the shower) and the investigations of the Bates' mystery never left my mind again. The sister of a friend of mine even couldn't use the shower anymore for several weeks and used her bathtub instead after having seen this movie...Now 20 more years have passed, and I just saw this classic again for the tenth (?) time? I don't know... but it's still very scary to me, and even if you know that Anthony Perkins, wearing a wig an old dress, is coming into the bathroom you will still bite your nails during this scene... ""Psycho"" is purest art - it's a timeless scare that will also fright and thrill the next generations of movie watchers. Excellent!",Psycho
362,droog-56936,Slasher Ground Zero,10,22 October 2019,The granddaddy of all slasher films Hitchcock's Psycho is film at it's highest peak. The story coils around you from the very beginning building your apprehension within the narrative until it suddenly shockingly turns on the viewer and subverts expectations in the smartest cinematic way possible.

363,theognis-80821,MASTERPIECE,10,26 March 2021,"A lengthy career directing movies prepared Hitchcock for this technical triumph of film craftsmanship. The perfect storyboarding and editing make it a model for professionals and students alike. The casting and acting are equally great, as is the Oscar nominated cinematography of John L. Russell, the editing of George Tomasini and the music of Bernard Hermann, with the titles by Saul Bass setting the mood. All four of these men worked frequently with ""Hitch"" in movies or on his TV show. Moviegoers lost sleep, found showers to be a stressful ordeal, and could never quite get this perfectly made film out of their minds, but, at least, we learned one very important fact: ""A boy's best friend is his mother.""",Psycho
364,Kubris,Terrifying Presence,9,20 June 2011,"IMDb Top 250: 24 Psycho is one of the most iconic films ever. The simple name, the menace, the immortal shower scene. the immortal, impossible- to-form-as- words screech of the violins during the most intense scenes in the movie. Psycho has stood the test of time, even 50 years later.It's still important to know that this film has aged, but only because cinema evolved. Movies became more graphic and visceral, but Psycho can still ensnare you in its grasp. Hitchcock is a brilliant director, it seems that everything is so easy to him. He has nine films on the 250, more than anyone else.It's interesting: over a half hour goes by before Marion reaches the Bates Motel,and the film is one hour fifty minutes. Time is taken to set up a plot and develop characters, which happens less and less today. Hitchcock takes his time... and when he strikes, there is true terror. The plot moves along, never taking too much time, and everything wraps up well.Most of the acting is fine, but Anthony Perkins stands out. 1960 must've been a strong year for him to not be nominated for Best Actor. His casual walk, his kind smile, it's unnerving. Something's up with Norman Bates. But the little things make it: his eye movements, muscle twitches- especially those- make him the star of the show.Yeah yeah yeah... the shower scene. Truth is, it's probably the most aged scene in the movie. But I won't dwell on something most of you already know.I was surprised by the music. While the screech is universally-known in film circles, I was impressed with the rest of the music, which fits the film completely.Psycho is an experience that must be seen by any film fan. If you can picture yourself in 1960, you could be shocked. Psycho is greater than the sum of its parts. 9.2/10",Psycho

367,martin-fennell,a masterwork by a master.,10,15 October 2016,"Alfred Hitchcock has referred to this as a comedy. People seeing it for the first time may raise a quizzical eyebrow. If you have seen it before, then some of the dialogue such as ""Mother, uh, what is the phrase? She isn't quite herself today."" does have a morguish humour about it.But it is definitely not a film at which you will do much laughing, if any. Here is a near perfect example of the cinema of terror. it starts off a gripping suspenser about a young woman on the run with some money she has stolen. But then the totally unexpected happens, and we are plunged into a world of nightmare. on the technical side, direction, photography, and music are superb. in the acting side, the performances are varied. But Anthony Perkins is excellent. How he failed to be even nominated for his performance is a total mystery. The same goes for Bernard Hermann's chilling score. Now for the bad news. What stops the film from being perfect is a rather lengthy explanation of the reasons behind what happened, as told by a psychiatrist, played none too convincingly by Simon Oakland. There is also the revelation scene, which if i recall correctly looks to be as if Perkins is giving a helping hand there. But ignore those small gripes, and prepare to be held on edge of your seat by one of the best chillers ever made.",Psycho
368,RobertF87,Among the Most Influential Films of All Time,10,16 January 2005,"This film has to rank as probably one of the most influential films ever made. It's one of those films that is referenced constantly. By the way, this is a film where the less you know about it beforehand, the more powerful it is. In fact in the original advertising, Hitchcock asked viewers not to reveal the film's shocks to their friends afterwards, and also that viewers had to be seated from the beginning of the film (when ""Psycho"" was released people were in the habit of walking into movies at any point). As a result, i will try my best not to give too much away.Based on a fairly good thriller by Robert Bloch, inspired by the life and crimes of real-life serial killer Ed Gein, this movie constantly unsettles the viewer. Hitchcock knew about suspense and he knew how to manipulate an audience which he does here brilliantly. Almost everything in this film is pitch perfect and the shocks are still striking. The actors, especially the brilliant Anthony Perkins, are all superb. Special note has to be taken of the famous score by Bernard Herrmann.Whether or not you're a horror movie fan, this is a must-see.",Psycho
369,jamiecostelo58,THE horror film!,10,15 January 2007,"Psycho is THE ultimate horror movie. What a brilliantly told story and equally powerful acting from all concerned. This movie details the aspects of shock and the macabre to chilling effect, and surely scared the wits out of cinema-goers back in 1960! Of course back then, a gruesome murder wasn't really seen on film before, not such a gruesome killing anyway, but it's highly common today. Hitchcock delivers a heart-stopping, gripping movie which doesn't let down for a single second. It's much better that the film was released in black and white; had it had been in colour, the fear and suspense may have been lost to some effect.Janet Leigh portrayed Marion Crane with wonderful agility, but we all know the real star of the show was (and is) Anthony Perkins. Norman Bates is probably the most twisted and scariest characters in the history of film, and Perkins delivers the vulnerabilities we see in Bates to stunning effect. I have huge respect for Vera Miles, and she was also well cast as Marion's concerned sister, Lila. A shame she has retired from the acting world...The suspense to Psycho starts right from the word go, what with the extremely haunting music to the opening titles, which continues in certain scenes throughout the film. An equally powerful and shocking ending too...Psycho is simply the ultimate horror movie, it hasn't been bettered, and cannot be bettered. The gruesome 'shower scene' featured not one violent shot - just illusion. But boy what illusion! Terrific, brilliant, excellent, superb, I can't go on enough!",Psycho
370,joshi_3592,Still chilling after all these years.,9,7 January 2010,"This is the mother of all slasher films and that chilling feel that some horror movies have. Instead of straight horror like monsters and ghosts, Psycho makes a physically normal human being more terrifying than any movie monster you've ever seen. What's so scary is that it could have happened, and if I'm not wrong Psycho is based on a true story. This movie is still chilling after all these years.I really wish modern day movie makers would go back to the feel of Hitchcock's movies. There's just something really scary about them. The realism, the acting, the cinematography and the music are just unique. There are few, but still some people who managed to continue the feel of Psycho. Take John Carpenter's Halloween (1978) a knife wielding maniac attacking babysitter at Halloween night. he wears a mask to hide his face and has no human emotions left whatsoever. And take the 2000 film American Psycho, a normally looking businessman who's well liked for his success, performs random violence and gruesome fetish killings at night. I Alfred Hitchcock had still lived i think he would have been very proud of the Psycho legacy.I must admit after years with seeing parodies and hearing references certain scenes of the movie isn't particularly scary anymore. Like the shower scene which has became a bit of a cliché by now. Nonetheless it's still a unique moment that shocked the audiences in 1960. But I warn you, even though some scenes are a bit outdated, it will still give you a scare. I'm serious I saw ""the Exorcist"" with no problem, but this movie freaked me out.This movie deserves attention for it's legacy and it's great actors and of course Hitchcock himself. I give it a 9/10.",Psycho
371,StevenKeys,Psycho,9,14 April 2021,"Inside every tough guy there's a little psycho, and inside every psycho there's a teensy-weensy mother just waiting to jump out and grab a knife with her cold, dead hand. So Al Hitchcock would have us believe after watching his psycho-drama of 1960.Born in London (Leytonstone), Al began in Silents, first directing rom-drams, then suspense (The-Lady-Vanishes The-39-Steps). Like many proven English makers, he'd cross the Pond, then the North American continent to the USA's movie mecca, Hollywood, expanding his repertoire on makes like Mr-&-Mrs-Smith Rear-Window Rebecca Saboteur and Strangers-On-A-Train, eventually focusing his energies on one genre. And of his vast catalog, two films stand out, cementing his place atop the hierarchy of horror directors: Psycho (60) and The-Birds (63), both ingenious tales set in eerily everyday circumstance, the latter airing on 70s TV with frequency (What's a little eye-gauging and tortious bird behavior, anyway, right?), and Psycho, with its famous chef salad shower scene and weird mother-son dynamic, proving too graphic for censors who sometimes DID know best. But with cable's arrival (80s) and codes liberated, all of us finally got to check-in the Bates Motel, assuming all risks and liabilities appurtenant (gulp).Psycho clearly crossed the line, but because it did so with style (Stefano & Bloch), its shocking visuals would change movies forever (how censors ever let it show in theaters is a small miracle, or deal made with the devil). Innovations in camera and edit, along with better developed characters fueling suspense, give it the edge over the feathered freakshow. It stars Anthony Perkins as charming but demented desk clerk Norman Bates in the role that made him as legendary as Hitchcock. Janet Leigh plays his gorgeous guest who jumps from the criminal frying-pan (APB) into the victim's fire, learning the hardest way possible that 'crime never pays!' Other contributors: lens-man John Russell (his frame and pull-back from the eye of a corpse is exquisite), music score by Bernard Hermann (the piercing note that powers the shower scene may be the most famous single tone in all of cinema) and editing by the highly under-rated George Tomasini (Rear-Window Stalag-17 Vertigo The-Misfits The-Birds The-Time-Machine).Missed the mark: 1) At first meet, Norman is too normal for what lay ahead, his ""mother"" and ""madness"" mentions a little too cute; 2) John Gavin's Sam is almost as weird as Norman, his attempts to fluster Bates enough to get the boyfriend tossed on his ear anywhere else, but then Loomis has his uses, and 3) I could've done without the last five minutes of psycho-splaining from the good doctor (Oakland) in preparation for Bates' legal defense (incompetence in Arizona), and yet, still a masterpiece (4/4).",Psycho
372,wandereramor,"Man, this is the weirdest adaptation of A Rose For Emily I've ever seen",8,31 August 2014,"A woman with a secret meets a man working at an out-of-the-way motel. He is neurotic but charming, and the two of them decide to eat dinner together. She learns about his problems getting out from under his domineering mother, and encourages him to stand up for himself. And then he stabs her to death.Psycho works so well not because it is gory or innately terrifying but because it uses the familiar tropes of romantic comedy to set up a string of horrific murders. It suggests that the ordinary people we like or even feel sorry for are just as dangerous as the ones we instinctively fear. Norman Bates' twisted psyche ties together love, violence, and the Oedipal complex -- Hitchcock's favourite themes, perhaps never realized so well.I've always been something of a Hitchcock skeptic, and Psycho contains its share of the overcomplication and affectedness that often dogs his work. There's a lot of glut here -- the whole plot line of Marian stealing the money, the tedious investigation sequence after the first murder, and the clumsy exposition that puts everything in a neat little box at the end. If Psycho is great, it's not because of Hitchcock but because of Anthony Perkins, who makes Norman Bates somehow pitiable and terrifying at the same time. The scenes he shares with Janet Leigh are captivating, and more than make up for the less memorable material surrounding them.Psycho may not live up to its reputation, but it's still well worth a look. You won't get a more pure exhibition of Hitchcock's obsessions than this, and you're not likely to see a better performance anytime soon.",Psycho
373,jaddison383,"Thank You, Alfred Hitchcock!",10,13 August 2007,"Alfred Hitchcock is clearly one of the greatest directors the world has ever seen. He proved this to me with Psycho, a film that has transcended time and technology to remain a masterpiece. It is ahead of its time in all its aspects: Cinematography, music, even the fantastic performances from the incredible cast. And it is all put together by a master: Mr. Alfred Hitchcock.Most people by now know the classic story: A young woman stuck in a road-blocked love affair steals $40,000 in a desperate last attempt to make a life with her boyfriend. She stays the night at a deserted and somewhat decrepit old motel, where she meets a young man who may not be quite what he seems. I won't say more. I was lucky enough to know nothing about the story when I watched it, and it only made my experience all the more thrilling.I must give credit to the absolutely perfect performances from each and every cast member. Both of the leading ladies are excellent. Janet Leigh plays the woman who stole the money, Marion Crane, while Vera Miles plays her sister. But of course the show completely and totally belongs to Anthony Perkins in what is probably one of the greatest performances ever given. He plays the young man who runs the old motel, and is our titular character. What Mr. Perkins did with this character is brilliant: He's a seemingly kind and attractive man. It's pure brilliance.Yes, Mr. Hitchcock gave us a true masterpiece with Psycho. It remains still one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I had trouble getting to sleep two nights afterwards! The film is shocking as well as groundbreaking. Thank you, Alfred Hitchcock! 10/10 stars! Jay Addison",Psycho
374,possumopossum,Two Psychos in This Movie?,9,15 May 2007,"Yes, we all know that Norman Bates was a psycho, but I tend to think that Marian was, too, to a lesser degree. It seemed that from the beginning of the movie until she was murdered, she was becoming more unhinged. She seemed paranoid throughout all her scenes, always looking over her shoulder, always nervous. Of course, she had reason to be, but something about these scenarios she played in her head while she was driving to Fairvale seemed unreal. Also, that cop that followed her to California was very unnerving. I sometimes wonder if that was real or a dream, or is Hitch leaving us to decide for ourselves if it is or not. Again, this scene seemed surreal. (That cop looked freaky. Like a commandant of a Nazi concentration camp or something.) Wasn't that Robert Stack who played the gentleman who sold her the car? It sure looked and sounded like him.This is another case of a beautifully crafted story. The way they played up the Norman/mother thing was just pure gold, what can I say? In 1960, this was probably pretty risqué, the opening scene showing Marion in a bra and a night slip in a cheap motel. Also, as I recall wasn't it kind of uncommon to show toilets in a bathroom in the movies? I know the codes were pretty strict back then. And the murder scene. Stephen King mentioned in his book DANSE MACABRE that you never actually see the knife striking Marion. You know what? He's right. I've seen this film dozens of times since I read that book and you don't see the knife actually striking her. Your imagination shows you that. But that movie has a helluva kicker at the end. I'm sure there are still one or two people out there who haven't seen it, so I won't spoil it for them. This is the only Hitchcock movie I have, and it's a doozy. A really great film from a legendary story teller. 9 out of 10.",Psycho

I t may not be the best movie like many people have claimed, the movie isn't very scary and the shower scene is very quick and over in a few seconds, but I guess it was made in the 60's when nothing like this had ever been done before. Yes I enjoyed it very much and I was thinking the whole way through. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman great, his friendly smiles, his comments his speeches ""We all go a little mad sometimes"") and just his general acting, the way he walked and moved. The story is Janet Leigh steals some money from her boss and takes off in her car to go to another city for the weekend. She stops off during a stormy night for a stay at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates. She gets into the shower in her room, but never comes out. Janet's family come looking for her, questioning all the places in the area, and they are curious about the Bates motel, for Norman isn't normal, and his loveable mother who sits in the house behind the hotel, isn't so loveable either.

376,fletch5,Remarkable.,10,1 July 2001,"When Saul Bass' opening credits begin to roll (combined with Bernard Herrmann's legendary score), you know you're in for a treat. However, the first half an hour of ""Psycho"" can get slightly tedious as it mostly consists of Janet Leigh driving a car. But as soon as she reaches The Bates Motel, the atmosphere increases to an electrifying level.
""Psycho"" made an enormous impression on me the first time I saw it (I was just 12). Luckily I had no idea about the twist in the end because it would have ruined the whole thing. Although the movie relies much on Hitchcock's innovative use of clever camera angles, its greatest asset is Anthony Perkins' outstanding performance that simply cannot be praised enough.
As some others have pointed out, the casting of John Gavin as Leigh's boyfriend was a terrible choice, but I believe Hitchcock wasn't very pleased with him either. Gavin's practically nonexistent screen appeal reminds me of those anemic actors in ""Strangers on a Train"". Can't believe he was to become the new James Bond until Sean Connery was lured back, thankfully!Regardless of that minor flaw, ""Psycho"" has earned its status in the history of cinema.

This is the movie with the shower/murder scene that is possibly the most referenced scene in movie history. Everything about that scene is classic, from the camera angles, to the music, to the blood running into the sink(which was chocolate syrup since the movie was in black and white).This is a very difficult film to write a review on. What I can say is take the advice given by Alfred Hitchcock at the showing of this movie when it was in the theater. His advice was to not even enter the movie if it had already started, because it can only be seen from the beginning. That is exactly how this movie is meant to be seen. Despite being in black and white, this movie is still a shocking experience. I think it should have been a crime to do what Hollywood did, they made a remake of this.

One of those films that it is hard to talk about for fear of giving away any of the numerous surprises.  All I will say is that this film has one of the best casting jobs in history.  Everyone is perfect for their role.  Even though the description of the movie is rather bleak, there are many funny lines in the movie that are even funnier upon repeat viewing (Hitchcock has said that this was a comedy).  I even like the much-maligned ending; ends the film on a satiric note.  One of the best movies ever made.",Psycho
382,Don-102,A Perfect Film.,10,28 June 1999,"Perfect films are few and far between and the filmmakers usually have no inkling as to the top-notch quality of work they are doing.  Alfred Hitchcock thought it was a good idea to make a new kind of suspense picture back in 1959.  Something that would give the audience goose bumps was in order, but bigger bumps must have been the goal.  Hitch had to use his TV crew (from his network series ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents..."" because many film executives didn't like the material.  Little did they know that the big Brit was about to make a cinematic milestone and change the way films are structured and material is presented.  At the time, PSYCHO was a nasty-spirited movie that led some moviegoers to leave early or stop taking showers.  It has held up amazingly well and is far superior to its countless rip-offs.PSYCHO is perfect because: 1) It is in black and white, not blazing technicolor which would have stained the film for no purpose and made the shower murder less artistic. (Hitch may have went the route of director Michael Powell who became an outcast once his technicolor murder flick PEEPING TOM was seen.)2)The featured star disappears a third of the way through igniting a new method of scriptwriting and casting.  (Hitch made strict stipulations for theatre owners not to allow people into the movie once the picture started in order for this secret to stay secret.)3)Lesser known actors are used to provide a more authentic feel for the characters.  This is so true in the case of Anthony Perkins, not exactly a Cary Grant, who creates a stunningly chaotic portrayal of an abused son/mental madman. (Hitch shoots him from tilted angles and shadowy atmospheres to project Norman Bates' unquestionably distorted state of mind, not to mention his evil grin.)4) The shower scene, of course.  Never before in any film of any kind known to man had people seen such frightening butchery and frank brutality. (Hitch storyboarded each of the 80+ cuts that take place within the 2 minute segment.)5) Norman Bates' mother, who sits upstairs in the ""old house on the hill"" and just watches what transpires when she's not taking part in it.  (Hitch makes her a mystery until the very end when she is finally revealed to us and to Vera Miles in a masterfully shot turn of a chair.)6)The set-up and payoff which consists of 40,000 dollars, a device common in most thrillers but new to this kind of psychological terror.  (Hitch makes the viewer think the 40 grand will be the staple of importance and plot when it really disappears amidst the horror and has no significance at all.)7)Finally, composer Bernard Hermann's famed musical score is a pulsating, vibrant piece of gothic composition that matches the story and character actions perfectly.  (Hitch and Hermann worked on several films together, none better than this.)Is there any other question that PSYCHO is one of the top 7 or 8 films of all time?  I don't think so.  Just look how film history began a slow course towards more independence and honesty after PSYCHO scared everyone into believing this kind of film could be made.RATING: 10+",Psycho
383,marissas75,A horror film that I actually admire,9,18 February 2007,"More so than with most films, it's impossible to watch ""Psycho"" these days in the same way that its original audience saw it, unaware of the shocks that lay in store. We all know what happens to poor Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) when she makes the fateful decision to stay at the deserted Bates Motel; maybe also the psychotic pathology of the motel's young proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). ""Psycho"" is widely regarded as the granddaddy of today's horror films featuring outlandish serial killers, after all. For this reason, though I'm a Hitchcock fan, I avoided ""Psycho,"" as straight-out horror is not my favorite genre. It's not that I get nightmares, it's that I dislike cruelty or exploitativeness. Fortunately, when I got around to watching the movie, I found it very impressive, and not at all gleefully bloodthirsty.For ""Psycho,"" unlike a cheap blood-and-gore flick, actually has a philosophy of life to go along with all its horror. In the world of the film, sin, such as Marion's stealing her boss's money, will always be punished. And the long conversation between Norman and Marion over dinner (very well acted by Perkins and Leigh) probes some pretty serious psychological depths. ""We're all caught in our private traps,"" says Norman, and the movie illustrates how first Marion, then Norman, gets trapped. What's most shocking about Norman is how pitiable he is, especially when compared with the villains/killers of other horror movies.Even though ""Psycho"" was made on a relatively low budget, having Hitchcock behind the camera makes for lots of subtly effective shots, images, motifs, etc. He orchestrates two frightening death scenes (I won't spoil it, but there's another, less famous killing that is just as effective as Marion's), a suspenseful beginning that fools you into thinking that Marion is the protagonist, and a quietly chilling conclusion. Bernard Herrmann's score really is as good as everyone says, and not only the shrieking violins during the famous shower scene. In particular I liked the scene where Marion is debating whether to steal the money, and the music mirrors her indecisiveness.I was very impressed by ""Psycho,"" but I'm not sure if it'll ever be one of my favorite Hitchcocks. There's at least one serious flaw: the lengthy scene where a psychiatrist over- explains Norman's psychoses, which is much too prosaic. Also, this is mainly a personal preference, but I tend to like Hitchcock better when he's indulging his love for working with iconic movie stars in glamorous scenarios. Still, I now have a new favorite horror film whereas before, I didn't have a favorite horror film at all.",Psycho
384,littlemartinarocena,Hitchcock and Herrmann,10,23 November 2007,"Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into a tight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinary complicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into a classic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the moment before the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation that verges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have become iconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have not diminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined by Herrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive. That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it or re-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version - so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous film accident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car...",Psycho
385,stefankrs,Very good,9,23 September 2021,"Wow, this movie is really good. This movie is really entertaining and suspenseful and it kept me questioning what is going to happen next.

Very good and entertaining movie, especially for the 1960s.",Psycho
386,BeanieCore,Simply a classic.,8,24 November 2020,"It's not much of a revelation to say that Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is a classic. Many would even call it a masterpiece, and I suppose that's where I differ. There's no denying the incredible impact the film has had on the horror and thriller genres, as well as cinema as a whole. It is simply a great film. But ""masterpiece"" is a term I use sparingly, and there are even other Hitchcock films I find to be slightly superior. The plain truth is, time has had a bit more of an aging effect on Psycho than some other films of it's age. First and foremost, everyone knows the twist. If you've somehow managed to avoid it, I commend you for living deep under the crevices of the world's largest rock. The once shocking ending of the film is so deeply engrained into popular culture that it's unavoidable. This obviously takes a bit of the punch out of a first-time viewing experience, but it is what it is. Secondly, the film's pacing can drag during moments, and it's unusually talky for a horror/thriller. Besides these two things, which aren't really setbacks, the film is fantastic. Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is the definition of iconic. He's so charming and unassuming that it's hard to suspect him, and his performance only becomes more layered after you've seen the film once. When the pacing does kick up, it does so sporadically, with the film being structured deceptively, so one is never quite sure when horror is about to strike. Hitchcock was not deemed ""the master of suspense"" for no reason, and this film serves as further proof of that fact. And while cliched by today's standards, it's twist ending set trends for years to come. Oh, and of course, who can forget the iconic shower scene, although I think the staircase killing is equally as brilliant. It's one of those horror films that anyone who takes the genre seriously must see, and respect. Not quite Hitchcock's best, but a great, incredibly important film all the same.",Psycho
387,mbhgkmsgg,Masterful,10,27 October 2020,"Where do you even begin with a film like Psycho. Everything about it is so masterfully done that there is very little that can be said. In addition, anything that could be said has already been said by others. Regardless, I will now tell you how I feel about Psycho and why I think that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.Where this movie really shines, is in building tension. Not a single scene or moment goes by where you aren't kept wondering what's going to happen and how it's going to happen. As soon as Marion leaves in her car, the tension starts to build. And not until the words, 'The End', appear on the screen, does that tension ease. There are, of course, stand out scenes, such as the infamous shower scene, or the staircase scene with Arbogast. However, what to me is even more impressive, is Hitchcock's ability to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat for the entire run time.Everything about this film is simply sublime. The music, the sound effects, the acting (especially Anthony Perkins as Bates), the locations, and perhaps most importantly, the pacing. The steady stream of clues and new mysteries keep you guessing throughout the film, making sure that there isn't a dull moment.If you haven't seen Psycho already, make sure you do. It is one of those rare films where I can't think of anything to change or add. And to be completely honest with you, I believe, as do many others, that this is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever created.",Psycho

390,parameswaranrajendran,A must watch if you are film lover,10,16 February 2018,"Psycho (1960) - A masterpiece from suspense and thriller guru, Alfred Hitchcock.

I believe that nowadays most people know those things without even experiencing this movie. Yet what still makes it stand out and earns the movie it's place among all-time great movies?I think the answer to that is the unique way this movie is able to shock you. You kind of expect what will happen because of small hints that are present in the dialogue and the background but even when it happens, you are left in shock, I can't really think of any other movie that has this quality. Usually you're left disappointed if the movie is too predictable. Not here.

392,raphaklopper,Best...nightmare...on real life...ever!,10,15 April 2013,"""Psycho"" is simply the best horror film ever made. The story is incredible, the acting is near perfection, the cinematography is awesome, the soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find is the Inability to stand the test of time. One of the Reasons the shower scene has become so notorious Is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in the shower was something no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing double-Jason Spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. Psycho its nothing like that, it's more! Aside from this though, the movie is flawless, the cinematography it's just incredible. The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh to the beautiful and sexy Marion Crane; Vera Miles to the Concerned sister; Lila Crane excellent; and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins to the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates. The film not only scares you a lot, but leaves you stuck on screen until the end of the movie, and only the strong survive's the insane dialogs, mentally, in the end, it will haunt you to the end of your lives, because ...

Each suspense point is unexpected, and cleverly, a representative thing will appear in each suspense point to intentionally mislead the audience.

397,ccamp89,"Iconic and masterfully executed, though thematically slight",8,28 June 2018,"Psycho is a perennial horror classic for good reason. Its best scenes are among the most iconic in the genre and remain potently suspenseful and visually arresting even if they aren't quite horrifying by today's standard. Going toe-to-toe with the ""scare"" scenes are a couple of tense dialogue exchanges that are just as compelling thanks to Anthony Perkins' layered and chilling performance.The highs are incredibly high, perhaps to a fault. Connective tissue scenes in the film which have the misfortune of resting before and after some of the best moments in horror can feel a bit mundane by comparison. There is an unevenness that has become more pronounced with repeat viewings, as I find myself looking forward to the best moments rather than enjoying each on its own merit. It may be a consequence of the fact that this is a film that is somewhat heavily reliant on its mystery and eventual twist, with many moments dedicated specifically to throwing the audience off the scent. Once you've seen the movie, the tricks take on a transparency that betrays the slightly shallow nature of the story. The execution makes up for these shortcomings convincingly, but Hitchcock has certainly made other thrillers that are much richer thematically (Rear Window, Vertigo), and less reliant on a central gimmick.Regardless, Psycho absolutely shines in its best moments thanks to the excellent performances and Hitchcock's masterful direction. It certainly deserves its classic status in both Hitchcock's filmography and the horror catalog at large, even if it lacks the consistency and substance of some of his other classics.Strong 4/5",Psycho

399,josephbrando,Overrated Slasher Relic!,5,24 July 2013,"Psycho (and Alfred Hitchcock movies in general) is one of the most overrated films in cinematic history. First off this has nothing to do with any distaste for ""old"" or ""black and white"" movies, as I very rarely watch anything post-1980. But this movie is just really boring. Maybe it's because it is so iconic that any scenes that are supposed to be scary have been burned into pop culture, thereby dulling its power. The first half of the movie, while slow, held my interest enough but once the main character is killed off, I found the movie unbearable to sit through. Yes I understand that this film was a trendsetter as far as slasher flicks go, but I think a real good movie will draw in and hold its audience's interest just as much as time goes on - and Psycho does not! At least not mine. If its place in horror film history is really the only selling point for this flick then it really should be in a museum and not on your television. The Hammer Films, Friday the 13th, Halloween, Val Lewton's films, Black Sunday, The Exorcist - now those are movies that have stood the test of time and retained their entertainment value and fright factor. I give this five stars for the good camera work and Anthony Perkins, who really eats up his role.",Psycho

It's got everything you could ask for in a movie of its type. ""Psycho"" is extraordinarily scary, especially for an older film. The B & W cinematography is enchanting and very creepy. Hitchcock sure knows how to shoot a movie and surround himself with the right people.The acting in ""Psycho"" is also amazing. Anthony Perkins is beyond creepy as the multi-dimensional Norman Bates. Janet Leigh portrays the flawed damsel part perfectly, and she brings a great strength to the role.I won't give the story's plot details so as not to spoil anything, but I will say that it is both incredibly compelling and strangely disturbing. There's a strong psychological aspect that gives the film a whole other dimension. You can watch it for the chills, the thrills, the themes, or all of the above.

It's rather hard to tell a lot about this masterpiece without spoiling some of the surprises contained in it but I'll try my best to spoil as little as possible.  This is definitely Hitchcock's best picture and it's really great.  For this movie, Hitchcock took many actors that were rather unknowns and made them movie stars by having perfectly directed them.  Plus, the idea and the script are exceptional and don't have any flaws.  And if that's not enough for you, just think of all the people that are afraid to take showers when they are all alone in their houses because of the traumatizing shower in the movie.  Anthony Perkins is brilliant as the hermit called Norman Bates who lives alone with his ""mother"".    It's pure genius and keeps you guessing until the end.  Martin Balsam and Janet Leigh are excellent as well in their supporting roles.  A sequel was made but I recommend only the first one (Hitchcock didn't direct the second one anyway).  You must see it.",Psycho

But what actually scared me, wasn't the fact that the killer murders someone in the bath, but the music. The screaming violin tune is one of the, if not, the most famous tune ever, which was copied to other films such as ""Carrie"" and ""The Amityville Horror"".Anthony Perkins does a great job of the motel owner - Norman Bates. He seems sympathetic, a nice young man, but being tormented by his sick mother, who always stands seating there, staring from the bedroom window of the ""Psycho house"" is also a great shot.Janet Leigh is great in this movie too, when she's running away from the police, you really can feel her fear, and it seems as she's also driving to madness!This great Hitchcock film, while, in the future, many other horror films will be forgotten, will stand up, and will remain known as one of the greatest films ever made!",Psycho

I didn't know much about in terms of story, actors, or really much of anything except it is considered Hitchcock's most popular film. After nearly 60 years later the film still has an impact. One thing is for sure, it inspired modern horror. A smart, bone-chilling, suspenseful horror film. No other horror film has had as much gravitas as Psycho before it, or since. The film is practically flawless starting with a sinister performance by Anthony Perkins. It doesn't take long once we meet him that something is definitely amiss with him. That's one of the things that Hitchcock does so well is he constantly cranks up the suspense, and twists our nerves and minds until it can't be tightened anymore than he lets loose. Revealing twists and turns no other director would ever think of. Psycho perfectly represents that, as the characters are well thought out, and each scene is cleverly put together. This film also holds some of the most iconic moments in cinema. Along with the creepy wrenching music by Bernard Herrman, which adds a whole new level of tension, to bring these wonderfully eerie scenes to life. As no other film before or since has ever reached the magnitude to Psycho, and it will stay that way for decades or even centuries to come.

I hate that I went in thinking it's a movie about Anthony Perkins/Norman Bates instead of Janet Leigh/Marion Crane. But even knowing what I did when I first saw it didn't take away too much from this masterpiece. Norman Bates, ever the victim, cleaning up after his mother's misdeeds. What great acting by Perkins. His delivery of such lines as ""We all go a little mad sometimes... Haven't you?"" with the chuckle in the middle. The look on his face when that car wasn't going to sink all the way. The way Arbogast had him flustered and his mother almost came out, ""I'm not a fool and I'm not capable of being fooled... Maybe she fooled me but she didn't fool my mother!"" What a great line that was anyway.Someone suggested that Vince Vaughan did a better job in the '98 version of Psycho. Oh no. No no no no no.

That is also when it left it's greatest impact. After you are knowledgeable of the conclusion, some of the impact wanes, if you know what I mean. It is a great movie but I think a bit over-rated. The second time I viewed it I am more able to appreciate the 'Hitchcock' technique of steering the viewer to assume a conclusion. In lesser hands this could have been mediocre. (See the sequels) Hitchcock has never failed to capture beautiful angles with each camera shot. Even after several viewings a veteran can still be unbalanced by Hitch's foreboding approach. Despite loving this film it would probably not be one I would select to show at a Halloween get-together - especially to those who have seen it a few times before. I am more 'chilled' by other movies. However, at a film discussion get-together - YES. If you haven't seen it - DO! You will love it!! If you've seen it once do see it again and enjoy Hitch's story-telling. He is quite good. If you've seen it frequently you are probably like me and don't NEED to see it again although it remains dear to your heart.

410,Holdjerhorses,Original Release . . .,10,24 October 2005,"In one of life's little ironies, my mother and I attended the opening of ""Psycho"" together. Unusual in itself, since I was in 10th grade and cannot remember EVER attending another film with Mom. Neither of us had any idea what we were in for.The audience was seated (as contractually required by Hitchcock) before the lights went down. The theatre was pitch black except for the small ""Exit"" lights. So effective was Hitchcock's pre-publicity for ""Psycho"" that everybody was already nervous: all we knew was that ""Psycho"" was going to be ""shocking."" Suddenly, out of the darkness, Bernard Herrmann's immediately nerve-jangling score attacked and the massive curtains slowly opened in front of the screen. ""Uh-oh,"" I recall thinking. No one had ever heard a score like this.Once the title and credits ended and the quiet pan across Phoenix's skyline began, I relaxed -- but only briefly. For here we were peering into a hotel window where the magnificently endowed Janet Leigh (in a bra and half slip) and a shirtless John Gavin were concluding their lunchtime tryst. Not the scene I would have chosen to be sitting next to my Mother for.By the time the shower sequence stunned everybody, I can still remember my Mother squirming audibly and uncomfortably next to me with every stab.Happily, she and I had a healthy relationship. Walking out after the lights came up, we were as silent as everybody else until we hit the sidewalk and daylight. She shook her head: ""What did you think of THAT?"" ""Damndest thing I ever saw!"" She agreed.It would be 13 years later, after I'd moved to Los Angeles and was writing for films and television, before I attended another opening that had an equally jolting impact on the public: ""The Exorcist."" I can't add anything to the comments already made about ""Psycho's"" technique and brilliance -- except perhaps to point out its film-making economy, still endlessly studied in film schools around the world.Try this: shut off the sound. ""Psycho"" STILL plays, coherently, as a maniacal SILENT FILM study of a psychopath.One shot in particular still haunts me for its storytelling simplicity. It's certainly not the most ""spectacular"" sequence in ""Psycho,"" yet its meticulous planning and perfect placement say perhaps as much about Hitchcock's command of film as anything else in his long career.After Marion Crane's brutal murder, and the camera pulls back from her lifeless eye, the camera moves out of the brightly lit bathroom over the sound of still-running water, across her empty motel room, past the rolled-up newspaper (containing the $40,000) on the nightstand, to the open window and the Bates house on the hill, where Norman is heard shrieking, ""Mother! Oh, God! Blood! Blood!"" After the assaultive flash-cuts of butchery (and the screeching violins of Herrmann's score, and the stabbing sounds) we've just witnessed . . . we're given a chance to catch our breaths over the near-silent sound of the shower. ""What on earth can happen NEXT?"" The lead character is dead.In this brief, quiet coda to one of the most electrifying sequences in film history, Hitchcock ""lets"" us recover . . . sort of. In fact, the camera's simple movement re-establishes the entire story arc of ""Psycho's"" first third, backwards from the murder to the reminder that Marion's stolen cash has led us here and lies in plain sight, waiting to be discovered, then forward in time again to the unknown horror on the hill. (The seemingly simple shot of the house through the window is actually a rather elaborate process shot that itself involves several elements, including that menacing sky.)Equally remarkable, Bernard Herrmann's disturbing score. If you can find it and listen to it apart from the picture, you'll appreciate its demented insect-like constantly unnerving, web-spinning, unsettling, biting, frightening power.Shockingly, Herrmann's score occupies barely thirty-minutes of the total screen time. Yet it's unforgettable.Here is a film, and a director, that is as effective and appreciated over 45 years later as it was the day of its release. Costing under a million dollars, it will retain its position as one of the finest, most visceral suspense films ever made . . . long after Spielberg's (another fine director) heartless, emotionless, expensive special-effects extravaganza, ""War of the Worlds,"" has been forgotten (if it's not already).",Psycho
411,tjgoalie13,"A Terrifying Horror Film, and A Compositional Masterpiece",9,1 October 2015,"Psycho is a classic horror film, directed by ""The Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock. Chosen to be shot in black-and-white rather than color, the tone is often terrifying, and the acting is chilling as well. The film is loaded with symbolism, and terrific composition that is just subtle enough to not give away the plot, but tells an educated audience member everything they need to know from a single frame.Psycho benefits from masterful direction from Alfred Hitchcock, who embodies what is considered perfect mise en scene, by making almost every object in frame important in some way. The composition of the film is extremely dense, whether it be symbolic, or narratively relevant, almost every frame is crucial for the film. A great example of this is the parlor scene, in which we see Norman Bates invite Marion into his parlor. One could argue the plot of the rest of the film is told through symbolism, and composition. In the scene the composition very heavily foreshadows the coming events of the film, as we see predatory birds and predatory sexualized paintings in the parlor, concurrent with Norman. As the audience sees a large Owl, in attacking position, on eye level with Norman, the meaning is clear. This composition is consistently used throughout the scene. Another example is Marion is usually in camera with ravens, very clearly foreshadowing her fate. It's this dense and brilliant composition that makes Psycho a great example of Alfred Hitchcock's genius. Another thing that is evident throughout the film is Hitchcock's style, whether it be his obsession with birds, his love of particular shots, or his undeniable voyeuristic use of the camera. Composition is the director's most direct route into the mind of the audience, if one knows what to look for they can learn about a director from his composition. What we see is Hitchcock likes shots that feel as if the audience is looking at the characters through something, whether it be a windshield, window, or hole in the wall. Using these shots Hitchcock almost makes the camera feel like another person viewing the film. It's the use of voyeuristic shots, and the attempt to make the camera feel like another character that subtly brings the audience to Norman Bate's level, at one point we even see shots from his perspective. I suspect this was done to muddle the message of who is right, and who is wrong, because the audience is both off put with the creepiness of Norman, but is also lead to be sympathetic. In essence Hitchcock makes a movie where we see no truly good characters, but no truly bad characters either. In the end Hitchcock created a masterful horror film that could still stand as one of the best all time. The black-and-white color, dense composition, and uneasy score make Psycho all the more terrifying. All-the-while setting the standard for how filmmakers would develop characters for years to come.",Psycho
412,andrewmerritt-31652,A horror masterpiece,10,4 November 2019,"Psycho stars Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins and is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The story revolves around a Phoenix secretary who is on the run after stealing $40,000 and checks in to the Bates Motel. This is my favorite horror movie and is also Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. I could really feel the passion he took to make this horror masterpiece instead of making a horror-movie-of-the-week. Also I want to point out that making a horror movie, a horror movie doesn't need to be in color all the time. A horror movie can have any color tone and still tell an interesting story, which is where Psycho succeeds, and having the black and white tone to it makes it more dark, ominous, and spooky. I felt that tension all around this movie as every department cranks their category from 0-100, that I was sucked into the world of Psycho. Norman Bates is my favorite serial killer. The reason why he's my favorite serial killer is because unlike most serial killers depicted in horror movies, Norman Bates doesn't try so hard. When we first meet him he's charming, handsome, and he's very friendly, but that scene where he and Marion are having a conversation, he becomes a slightly different person, and that's when we realize that something is not quite right with him. And maybe this is just me, but even though he's a serial killer, I still feel compassionate towards him in some twisted way, that made me believe that he isn't a bad person after all. But what I find genius is that the script tricks us into believing that Marion is the main character, but it isn't until the second act, that we realize that she isn't the main character anymore. Its as if the script department were separated into two categories where one half was responsible for developing Marion's character, while the other half was focused on the events after Marion's death. I know I've posted spoilers about this movie, but this movie is too good to pass up on some spoilers. So in the end, this is my favorite horror movie, and I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the horror genre. Because to me this is the one that started it all and made other horror movies take inspiration.",Psycho
413,darkjosh,Perkins Is Remarkable,9,12 September 2000,"Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits.  Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath.  One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling.  He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).Perkin's fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein's classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre.",Psycho

415,tjsdshpnd,A Milestone in the Thriller Genre,10,16 June 2009,"Director : Alfred Hitchcock Cast : Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera MilesUndoubtedly the most popular movie created by the genius Hitchcock, Psycho is a masterpiece from all aspects of film making, be it the plot, screenplay, cinematography, sound and above all direction. It is a very intelligent thriller and keeps the viewer engaged and enthralled until the last frame.The plot revolves around a highway motel and it's caretaker and owner Norman Bates, his sick and somewhat spooky mother, a woman who steals large amount of money from her employer to improve her love life with her boyfriend and who comes to stay at this Bates motel . The proceedings that follow are extremely interesting and enthralls the viewer. We get to see perhaps one of the best murder scenes ever shot in cinematic history, the famous shower murder of the lady who stays in the motel . The protagonist of the movie Norman Bates character has been very well written and performed by the actor concerned as well. Sometimes we as an audience feel pity and sorry for him and after knowing his mental condition, this feeling increases even more.In short, Psycho is one of the milestones of this particular thriller genre. Many thriller movies either based on this or influenced by this have come in many large numbers, but the charm and the greatness of this particular movie will remain in the minds of cinema lovers for eternity.Rating : 9/10",Psycho

But, alas, I rented it again a few weeks ago and I didn't like it. Didn't like it at all. I bloody loved it! Psycho is a freakin' masterpiece! It is easily Alfred Hitchcock's best film, and it is definitely an unforgettable chilling classic. Anthony Perkins was brilliant as Norman Bates, I will certainly look out for more of his work in the coming months. Janet Leigh was also very impressive, she was a real gem of Psycho.So, don't make the same mistake I did, watch this classic today, and I guarantee you'll never forget it. Rating: 10",Psycho
418,Dandy_Desmond,Genius,10,2 March 2010,"I recently watched this film having not seen it for a long time. After being numbed by a lot of crap horror movies lately I was taken aback by the films genius. The first half of the movie, if you hadn't seen it before, you would think is about the stolen money, that Norman is going to steal the money from Marion and escape his 'trap'. This all changes when the woman we have spent a while getting to know is murdered in a memorable shower scene by a woman in black. Norman cleans up after 'mother' and dumps all her belongings including the money he didn't know was there in the swamp! So what next? This is the genius of Psycho. Janet Leigh was a big star at the time and to see her dispatched so coldly would have been a great shock and after all she was the main character wasn't she? Brilliant. Anthony Perkins is outstanding as the nervous but friendly Norman Bates. There is no showmanship to his performance, it is ahead of its time. Janet Leigh is equally outstanding as the doomed Marion Crane and when she is killed you miss her for the rest of the film. The weak link is John Gavin, he is the old school of actor, very handsome and strong leading man type which in contrast to Tony Perkins modern approach shows badly. When they share a scene together you can see the difference in class between them but its a minor flaw. Finally Bernard Herrmann wrote a wonderfully twisted and eerie score to accompany Hitchcocks sure direction. Its a work of genius. If you haven't seen it - get it on your list!",Psycho

The most frightening horror movie 2. The best filmed horror movie 3. The best ACTED horror movie 4. The best directed horror movie.  VERY FEW movies set the viewer up with one character as a setup for another even better character.  But, Psycho did it, and did it well.  Of course, everybody has heard about the ""shower"" scene.  And, it was certainly something nobody had ever seen before.  Today, it is considered very mild.  But, that scene is only a small part of the movie.  The rest is just good it is almost beyond words.

What really surprised me was that the blood from the notorious 'shower scene' was actually chocolate syrup! For me after 'North By Northwest' this was Hitchcock's best piece of work. Every movie has a bit where it probably would never happen and Psychos is the death where the detective gets stabbed at the top of the stairs and manages to slide all of the way down them again BACKWARDS! But other than that I say well done to the great Alfred Hitchcock",Psycho
423,cleary-joshua,"One of Hitchcock's very best works, and among Herrmann's finest scores",10,11 July 2013,"Despite being shot in 1960, when colour technology had taken over and was thriving, Alfred Hitchcock decided to shoot his masterpiece ""Psycho"" in black and white, in order to keep his budget down. However the black and white adds so much more suspense and mystery to the film, which keeps throwing curveballs at the audience. It tells the story of Marion Crane (at the start anyway), a woman who decides one day to run away with Having done this, she becomes instantly paranoid, convinced that a policeman is following her. While driving off in the rain, she gets panicked, and checks in at a strange motel called ""Bates Motel"", inhabited only by a young looking Norman Bates and his mysteriously unseen mother.I don't really want to say more about the plot than that, since it's a film that constantly surprises with its plot. Sure, 90% of people know about the famous ""shower scene"" which is still very scary to this day, but what comes after it was very unexpected for me. I had no idea at the 60 minute mark where the film was going to go. Anthony Perkins' performance as the calm looking but psychopathically twisted Norman Bates is a fine one, and there is a lot of depth and evil concealed behind his eyes for most of the film. From the first moment we see him, you are certain he's a killer, he's just got an evil look to him.The set design and cinematography are both fantastic, and the Bates house is particularly creepy standing atop the hill. The opening shot of the cityscape is also great, with the camera gliding over into the hotel room. What really makes this movie so incredible to me is the soundtrack. Bernard Herrmann here provides one of his very best movie scores, with so much menacing, anger and suspense in every cue. The violence of the ""Prelude"" music sets the audience up instantly for a thriller, and even though the first 25 minutes are fairly tame, the music keeps returning to remind you that something is coming. Also, the fact that he writes only 4 proper cues which he reuses throughout the whole first 50 minutes is incredible, because they don't seem monotonous, and have a new side to them each time.In short, because I really don't want to give much away, this is an absolute masterpiece, one of Hitchcock's very best works. It's got violence, suspense, drama and thrills, and somehow a lot of depth along with that.",Psycho
424,vishaal811,An Untouchable Masterpiece!!!,10,27 July 2015,"When you are watching a great movie, it can be ascertained within the first few seconds itself. Psycho, is no exception to that rule, as it has influenced several genres of film and has been widely imitated yet no other movie has managed to replicate the staggering impact that it had.A secretary steals $40000 and decides to run away. While escaping in her car, she has to stop for the night and retires to a secluded motel that is far away from the highway. Here, she encounters Norman Bates, the owner of the motel, who seems like a perfectly normal, charming person who has a cheerful demeanor.The acting is phenomenal and the natural performances by everyone involved in this movie make it seem effortless. Alfred Hitchcock, who is regarded as one of the most influential directors ever, has shot this movie brilliantly and every shot, every scene seems like a crucial piece in the puzzle that this movie is. Psycho would not have been nearly as effective if not for the haunting score composed by Bernard Hermann. The music that is played during the shower scene is one of the most recognizable and compelling pieces ever written. As the tone of the movie is rather mysterious, the score serves as an audio guide due to the ominous sounds that are played.Psycho is a compelling, ingenious, and singular movie that has managed to push the boundaries of filmmaking and is one of the best movies that has ever been made. No amount of praise will be able to take away the magic of this movie which can only be experienced by viewing it.",Psycho

432,Maladjusted_1,One of the most thrilling titles ever made.,10,4 August 2015,"I suppose it's quite peculiar that I only saw 'Psycho' after seeing around a dozen other Hitchcock titles, given that it's his best- known film. As I pressed 'play', I made the mistake of assuming that it'd just be a seminal slasher film, lacking the complexity of other Hitchcock titles such as 'Rebecca' and 'Vertigo'. I'm glad to say that I was wrong. The score was perfect, and I'm not just talking about the piercing shrieks of the legendary shower scene. It remains amongst the most iconic in cinema, and is just as foreboding as John Williams' score for 'Jaws'. Another winning feature of Hitchcock's horror is the excellent acting. I hadn't heard much about Anthony Perkins prior to watching 'Psycho', and so I was sceptical as to how he could portray a villain as iconic as Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader. His acting talents shine from the first scene in which he appears, though, and Perkins delivers a truly outstanding performance as the crazed motel manager, Norman Bates. The performances of Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and the other actors in 'Psycho' are just as good as Perkins'. The twists and plot developments delivered in the film are similarly brilliant. After the shower scene, I wasn't sure that the film could surprise me or really offer me much, but I was – once again – surprised. The level of danger perceived in 'Psycho' is much greater than that in many other Hitchcock titles, and I never thought that a 55-year-old film could grip me like this did. The brilliant director's other titles were certainly thrilling, but the threats facing actors such as James Stewart, Joan Fontaine and Tippi Hedren seemed either relatively minor ('Rear Window'; 'Rebecca'), more intriguing than dangerous ('Vertigo'; 'Suspicion'), or even comical ('The Birds'). 'Psycho' could not be dismissed in this manner, and I found the plight of Vera Miles and Janet Leigh just as intense as Jodie Foster's in 'The Silence of the Lambs', if not more so. At points, Alfred Hitchcock's iconic horror was creepier than 'Rosemary's Baby' and more shocking than 'The Exorcist', and the director accomplishes this without delving into the supernatural or paranormal. I'd go so far as to say that this title is one of the greatest films ever produced, and it certainly ranks as my favourite Hitchcock title at the moment. Upon watching 'Psycho', you'll realise how even acclaimed thrillers such as 'Se7en' and 'Misery' pale into passivity.",Psycho

It is the inspiration behind a great number of films since and will forever be THE ultimate in both plot twists and suspense. Who would have ever imagined killing off both the main character and what seemed like an interesting story only a third into the film? Well, Hitch did and even told the moviegoers at the time to show up for the beginning of the film or else miss the wonderful Janet Leigh.Psycho has it all. A great story, well two as a matter of fact. One of the greatest scores by Bernard Herrmann (how many people don't know the skreetching violin and deep tuba sounds that really make the shower scene a classic?). The acting is superb with the chilling, almost-too-real portrayal of Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins and the running scared, almost-too-clued-out portrayal of Marion Crane by Janet Leigh. The supporting cast complete the film like few other casts do. Vera Miles makes the role of Crane's sister, honestly real and more than just a plot device.This film succeeds in all aspects, including the ending which is often said to be overlong and unecessary. Without hearing the inner thoughts of Bates, however, would leave a gaping hole in the production. The double image of Bates face with his mother's scull remains chilling, even in today's glorified, Natural Born Killers-like ultraviolence. Hitch's direction and shot techniques are as innovative as those seen in some of his earlier films like Vertigo and North-by-Northwest. Next time you watch Psycho, slow down the shower scene just to see how many separate shots Hitch put together to make it so great. Quite calculated.It's a shame that a film like Psycho had to have been marred by a few sequels and a terribly awful shot-by-shot remake. Unlike a continuing storyline like that of ""The Godfather"", this story should have ended here.Full recommendation.9/10 stars.",Psycho
437,gbrumburgh,Hitchcock's landmark horror that led to a slew of slayers.,10,28 April 2001,"This is the 1960 culprit that catapulted the horror film to an altogether new and gruesome plateau.  It's the ship that launched a thousand blood-spurting imitators, although that was never Alfred Hitchcock's intent. Unfortunately, 90 per cent of those writers and directors inspired by his unprecedented work in ""Psycho"" never got past the initial primitive thrill of seeing on-screen violence for the first time.  They didn't ""get"" the homework that went into this brilliantly macabre masterpiece.  Just what DID make the infamous shower scene and ""Mother"" Bates' stairwell confrontation so shockingly memorable, other than providing front row forum seats to the carnage?With ""Psycho,"" the master of suspense would tempt us to enter the intricate, insidious mind of a violent, psychotic killer, something he surely tampered around with in ""Strangers On a Train.""  Hitch himself created the essential tool kit for modern day terror  implementing story, set-up, characterization, photography, camera technique, mood and music in order to weave an elaborate spider's web that would playfully entice, then seduce his intended victim, the audience.Norman Bates will forever be enshrined as THE infamous poster boy of cinematic psychosis.  As expounded by Simon Oakland's psychiatrist in the last reel, Norman was an isolated, terrified, severely undernourished man-child consumed by a hideously abnormal fear of change.  In the end, the self-suffocating Norman lashed out like a wild, kicking, screaming child at a world he never knew or understood.  Smart enough to distance himself and the Bates Motel as far from the highway of humanity as possible, it still wasn't far enough.  For somewhere down the line, fate, coincidence, or maybe just a primal need for human contact, would inevitably lead a John Doe (or Marion Crane) to his door.The most compelling scene for me is when the verrrrrry brave Lila Crane sneaks into the decrepit Bates' house behind the motel to investigate her suspicions as to sister Marion's disappearance.  After coyly tormenting us throughout the first three-fourths of the movie, Hitch finally lets us in on the equally decrepit world of Norman Bates and his mother.  Norman's bedroom holds the key elements to his enslaved childhood.  The pathetic little bed with his careworn stuffed animal nearby, the little phonograph with Beethoven's ""Eroica"" record in place.  It's such a private, eerily invasive moment that one feels guilty for possessing this natural Peeping Tom' curiosity.Seeing Norman huddled up looking maniacally serene, immured within the confines of a ""new"" prison and armed only with a security blanket, you know that the poor innocent fly that lands on his hand, a fly he promises to respect, will never see the light of day again.  And neither will Norman...despite the inferior sequels that tried to alter his obvious fate.We can only thank Anthony Perkins for sacrificing a brilliant, promising, and highly versatile film career after bestowing upon us the most definitive, sympathetic creature of violence ever to assault the eyes. There will never be another one like him.  Janet Leigh, one of Hollywood's biggest, fluffiest stars at this juncture, graciously cut short a dramatic ""starring"" role and instead offered us the screen's most tragic golden girl of all time.  Both of their sacrifices were rewarded with film immortality.I was introduced to ""Psycho"" at the age of 9.  My older brother and I had the option one night of seeing ""Psycho"" or Jerry Lewis' ""Cinderfella"" at the local Riviera Theater.  I wanted Jerry Lewis but my older brother had clout and, of course, won out.  Needless to say I lost a good portion of my innocence (and my hair!) that night, succumbing to the frequent nightmares and shower traumas that obviously accompany such a youthful experience.  Oh, yes, there is that abnormal fear I developed of screeching violin strings...On a bright note, my faith in today's horror suspense was restored after experiencing the bravura Shyamalan-directed ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Blair Witch Project"" a raw, but creepy and effective little thriller filmed on a pittance.  Both took stock of Hitchcock's tool kit for terror.  ""Blair Witch"" proves once again that the real horror of shock films today lie not in its low-grade budgets, but in its third-grade scripts and mentality.Alfred Hitchcock opened our eyes in awe, wonderment and, yes, horror.  But never in disgust.  And he never sacrificed his story or characters for the sake of shock.  We can only apologize for all the gratuitous ""Friday the Thirteenth"" and ""Halloween"" dreck that rose out of his ashes.",Psycho

439,asenkron,The best film that I have ever seen including thoses to Hitchcock films,10,27 December 2007,"I have completed almost % 60 of IMDb's top 250 list and it may be big talk but as I said above this is the best film that I have ever seen. I read lots of comments related to it, but almost nobody emphasizes the conversations that psychiatrist made. This is why I praise as it is in title. Most people say that the scenes like that bathtub hole or murderer with knife make it enormous. I agree with the people who think like that but in fact there is a more important scene that you watch breathless. These scenes are that the psychiatrist made inferences from Norman Bates' view and words. I will never forget these scenes.According to the story, Marion Crane works in an estate agent and she is wanted to deposit 40.000 $. Crane doesn't return to the agent. Everybody believe that Crane runs away with his friend Sam Loomis but the truth isn't like that. Crane starts to stay in Bates Hotel that takes part in the way that goes to his friend's town. Afher even her sister lost the connection with her, a detective starts to search for her but he disappears like her, too.A man who has two personality that he switch one of them spontaneously. This man is Norman Bates that makes history in cinema by Hitchcock. If your list lacks this masterpiece like me, complete it the shortest time as you can.Quite impressive tension scenes and of course together with sounds, inferences made by the psychiatrist, scenes that make you ask Bates' mother all these are unforgettable about Psycho.My admiration to Hitchcock increases step by step. Thanks a lot for all of them.",Psycho
440,pnpete9,Not Hitchcock's Best,6,29 October 2019,"Have recently watched this movie for the first time in years and was surprised how lame it now looked.
Whilst the performances regarding acting a good, particularly Perkins the story is not credible, even laughable in places. If you want suspense then go for Rope. Hitchcock had lost his touch with this film including Birds",Psycho
441,miss_lady_ice-853-608700,Classic influential horror,8,30 October 2012,"There's no denying Psycho's classic horror status. Hitchcock had done creepy Gothicism before, such as in Rebecca, and he'd done charming murderers before, such as in Strangers on A Train, but he hadn't done a slasher.Psycho is what it says on the tin: it's about a psycho. Exploring the deep psychosis of a murderer was not something that had been done in Hollywood film before. We all know the shower scene but not everybody knows the nature of Bates' psychosis so I won't say anything on that topic. The psychiatrist at the end is a clumsy clunky Hollywood addition explaining the blatantly obvious. I fail to see that in 1960, the audience wouldn't have worked it out. It's a testament to Hitchcock that he still manages a creepy final scene. Bates may be a psycho but we can't dismiss him in the way that we may have dismissed previous psychotic villains.Of course, the star of the film is Anthony Perkins. Everybody else is either bland or annoying and quite frankly, you want them all to die (maybe not the hot guy). Janet Leigh as Marion Crane...thank god we didn't have to spend too long with her. She spends most of the film in her bra (now a horror cliché)and steals loads of money from her boss. It's interesting that Hitchcock chose to make her so unsympathetic.Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, the proprietor of the motel that Marion checks into. He looks just like a creepy bird but initially he's quite sweet. It took me a minute to clock that he was going to be our psycho. One thing I will say on his psychosis was that the psychiatrist says he is straight, which I don't entirely buy. I think that's just to placate the audience.Now, Psycho has been compared to Peeping Tom (or rather, Peeping Tom has been endlessly compared to Psycho. See my review on Peeping Tom for more info). Peeping Tom came out a few months before and on the surface it has a lot in common with Psycho: both have a handsome man who is psychologically disturbed with parental troubles and murders women. However the major difference is that Psycho cemented Hitchcock's reputation and Peeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's illustrious career. So what gives? Psycho has lingering shots of a woman in a bra, gore and explicit horror; Peeping Tom has no blood, only brief nudity and no explicit horror. Surely if any film was going to shock the critics, it would be Psycho? Yet the only thing that the British censors objected to in that film was a flushing toilet.Actually, no. Hitchcock was famously the master of suspense and had dabbled in types of horror before- it was obvious that he would progress to something like Psycho. Powell was known for his partnership with Emeric Pressburger, making beautiful innocent British films (although at times some of them are very dark). He threw a curve ball and we couldn't take it. In some ways, Psycho is a mystery story and in the moments when the boyfriend and Marion's sister are exploring the motel, it brings to mind some of the creaky mystery moments Hitchcock had in his earlier films (Stage Fright, for example). Peeping Tom is not a mystery story. Bates is a main character but Mark Lewis is our protagonist. We see everything through his eyes. Both characters are handsome and polite but once we know something's up with Bates, we don't view him in that way. We always know that something's up with Mark Lewis and yet he's so adorable and polite and we never want him to get caught. Ironically, there are many moments where he almost gives himself away and we're shouting at the screen telling him not to.As for the psychology, Psycho explains everything. Bates is a classic textbook psycho. Lewis is a very disturbed pervert but he's more than a Psycho. His problems stem from the sadistic experiments his father does on him. We see some, but not all. What we do see is horrible but it's only scratching the surface. It's a more interesting imaginative bit of psychology than Psycho.Finally, the cinematography. Both films do brilliantly here- there's lots of creepy jump cuts and close-ups in Psycho. A particularly creepy moment is when Bates is framed by lots of stuffed birds glaring down at him. And it's all in scary black-and-white but not the cliché lurking in the shadows. But for my money, the cinematography in Peeping Tom is better. It's filmed in garish seedy colour, which makes it all the more scary. There's a clever bit of filming where Mark is looking through a grill with a birds eye view of the room and then the angle changes so we see the pens from his pocket falling down. The whole premise of Peeping Tom is a guy who kills with his camera and the cinematography takes full advantage of this. Filming in shadows and gloom is a cliché- luckily neither film does that.Psycho is still a scary film- dated in its treatment of the secondary characters but modern as ever with its treatment of the psycho. Loads of thrills and chills to be had here. This film changed the horror genre in America forever.",Psycho
442,cartesianthought,Masterfully directed nail-biting horror,9,13 May 2016,"Hitchcock really is brilliant. I could predict the plot from a mile away, but I still felt suspense and shock in nearly every scene. Even the smallest moments, like Marion unpacking her things or being stopped by a police officer, had me scared. I feared for the danger of the innocent lives, but in a way, I also felt the fear of the killer's private details being exposed as well.I like how Psycho initially tries to be one kind of movie and then startles the viewer once it develops into an entirely different animal. With the ending in mind, I'm compelled to go back and re-watch it to find small details I missed. It's a low budget movie, but every little humble scene packs an enormous amount of weight to it.",Psycho
443,zensixties,"Great film making, but lets face it: this plot and dialogue are weak",8,14 February 2013,"Psycho is so overpraised as the greatest horror film of all time that it's hard to break the trend, but here goes. One obvious weakness is the utter ridiculousness of Norman's insanity. I mean, come on! He becomes his mother after he kills her? That would be the only case in all of human history I believe. And the psychologist figures the whole thing out after like 10 minutes with him?The other weaknesses concern the whole film prior to arrival at the Bates Motel. We get a mediocre beginning with Janet Leigh and that guy in the hotel room; I don't find her attractive--sorry. Why is it exactly they were keeping the affair secret? Who knows and who cares. Then some rich Texan comes in, Hitch's non-actress daughter has the part and says ""I declare!"" He says ""I don't, that's how I get to keep it."" Cheap dialogue really. Then Leigh steals the money and drives away, then buys a new car which does nothing, but raise the suspicion of a cop and car dealer? This film would be completely forgettable if not for the great Anthony Perkins, the great film soundtrack, and a great director.To drive my point home, imagine the film without the soundtrack and cutting out the Anthony Perkins scenes.

446,MovieDude1893,Dares You to Look Away,10,21 April 2012,"Although his filmography is studded with gems, no other Hitchcock film has lodged itself in the popular consciousness as firmly as Psycho. It provides chills as a ripped-from-the- headlines slasher flick, but its macabre surfaces conceal its deeper mordant cultural resonances. In Psycho, many of Hitchcock's major tactics fall under the wide umbrella of postmodernism. Although made within the confines of the last vestiges of the classic Hollywood studio system, Psycho distinguishes itself as a subversive postmodern cinematic text. Hitchcock's is the dominating presence in the film. From the beginning we are privy to dastardly deeds done by less-than-savory people. Yet, even as the brutality is ratcheted up (culminating in Marion's death), the audience remains engaged and more specifically entertained. The traditionally positive and pure elements of society when viewed through Hitchcock's lens are rendered resoundingly impure. Caroline, Marion's pestering co-worker, needed tranquilizers to survive her own wedding; Tom Cassidy heartily recommends the practice of ""buying off unhappiness"" to turn it into something approaching happiness; police and detectives fail to provide satisfactory protection; and in the Bates family one certainly begins to doubt that mother knows best. This is contrasted to the immoralities within the film. Sam and Marion's affair, Marion's theft, and Norman's killings are, without exception, attractively presented. The affair titillates, turning Marion into an erotic symbol. By the time of the theft, Marion has won the allegiance of the audience. Even the film's most legendary element, the shower scene, can today be viewed as more giddy than gory. It plays more as symphony than tragedy. It is a feat of timing and rhythm with precise and effective choreography. Traditional horror films dare the audience to look at the screen; Psycho dares us to look away and we simply cannot. The film itself defies convention and flaunts expectations at every turn. At the end of the first act, it abruptly transfers the mantle of protagonist from Marion Crane to Norman Bates. The transfer makes sense. After all, these are the only two characters in the film that truly matter. In the words of critic David Thomson, ""they are the only two players in the film whom Hitchcock liked or was interested in"". As a mainstream Hollywood director, Hitchcock's interest in these two people, one a thief, the other a psychologically fractured killer is in and of itself subversive of audience expectations. Psycho was released in mid-1960 still very much in the shadow of the outwardly wholesome, domesticated Eisenhower era. To have a film focused on such behavior in the era of Leave it to Beaver was not only bold, it was unprecedented in mainstream American cinema. Psycho's low-rent aesthetic of highway towns and motel rooms is unique in the typically more elaborate and glamorous Hitchcock oeuvre. In an era when films were bought and sold based on star power, Hitchcock bumps off poor Janet Leigh (herself only a moderate star at the time) by the close of the first act. Audiences thought they knew what they could expect from the movies, especially the ones made by ""Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock; but the moment that shower curtain opens to the ascending strings of Bernard Herrmann's score, all bets are off. No one and nothing is safe, not even the lifestyles of the rich and famous.Apart from its more coy and wily elements, Psycho is also a film preoccupied with surfaces and appearances. By virtue of the funhouse construction of the film, Hitchcock cannot be bothered with traditional character development. The four major characters of the piece— Norman, Marion, Sam, and Lila— act as doubles for one another. In Lila, we find traces of Marion. Both are traditionally attractive blondes, yet the sexual vivacity of Marion that her screen time so effectively showcases is dulled and diluted within Lila, who can seem pestering and frumpy in comparison. These parallels perhaps could be written off due to the sister relationship between the two, except that the more interesting parallels between Sam and Norman undermine any sort of quick fix. Norman and Sam share a similar facial structure and hair color. Clearly, Sam is meant to represent the more stereotypically strapping male suitor, whereas Norman is best characterized as meek and uncertain. Yet, throughout the film our impressions of the two men are colored in surprising ways. Norman, despite his compulsions, comes off as a caring and compassionate young man, shy but capable of deep and true understanding. Hitchcock, in a move of swift and delicious irony, makes Norman into the most sensitive and kind person the picture has to offer. Norman's final conversation with Marion before her death is the film's most intimate scene. Although the two start the scene as total strangers, it is clear that they have had a deep effect on one another by the scene's close. In contrast, Sam seems increasingly boorish and bullying as the picture unspools. He's certainly less interesting than Norman. Indeed, we learn precious little regarding Sam in the movie's first half. Despite her claims of love, Marion spends relatively little time considering Sam's views of her actions. His hypothetical thoughts never enter her mind on the run from Phoenix. Her deepest emotional connection in the film is with Norman, and Sam seems to share a more matrimonial relationship with Lila than he does with Marion. Yet, in their momentary connection, Marion and Norman shared something more lively and meaningful than Sam seems to be capable of imagining. This lively connection, of course, must end in death in Hitchcock's world. Hitchcock, ever the ironist.Psycho's endurance as a piece of popular art is quite a feat. In fact, the very existence of the film is worth championing. It is a film where commercial aims exist in equal balance to artistic ambitions, where those goals are allowed to be complimentary. It holds a mirror to a polluted world in order to reveal the cracks in the surface, an impure subject made enthralling through pure cinema.",Psycho

Psycho follows Marion Crane a asssistant who after getting a whole lot a cash from one of her bosses customers ends up running away and eventuallu running apon the bates motel on her travels and from there her fate is sealed. Janet Leigh is Marion Crane our leading lady through Psycho and she has such a iconic role that it has cemented her in pop culture forever and she is amazing and one of my favorite scenes with her is when she is in the car and she is thinking of all of the senarios of what people say after she goes missing and her facial expressions are perfect for describing what she is thinking in her head. Anthony Perkins is Norman Bates and he has one of the scariest preformaces in cinema as the errie owner of the motel who is haunted by his over protective mother and she is a looming part of his life and even in facial expressions alone this guy can be scary and one of the best parts of this movie.the cast also has amazing supporting stars like Vera Miles,John Gavin, Martin Balsam, john McIntire and Simon Oakland the cast that is more supporting is also as good as the main two stars who get plently pf screen time.
Psycho is by far my Favorite Hitchcock movie Psycho plays on peoples fears and also makes some afried of going in the shower and that was only thought of because of Psycho and it is one of those moves that has become so iconic that it's a movie that is a must watch for horror fans and for any movie buff or general movie watcher and i would recommend it as it is a Hitchcock movie that lot's of people were talking about and still haven't stopped talking about and that is why i rate Psycho 10/10 it is supurb",Psycho

When it first came out, it was greeted with screams of laughter. People laughed all the way through, so much so that he declared it was the first time he had ever been out-thought by an audience. He knew it was going to be funny, but he didn't realize it was going to be that funny.""

456,donuthaters12,A Film That Shaped Modern Thrillers,10,5 July 2013,"Major Spoilers Below....""We all go a little mad sometimes."" Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a suspense, thriller film that is still effective today. I have not seen a lot of Hitchcock's films and the ones I have seen are the most known; Vertigo, Rear Window, North By Northwest and now Psycho. This film has become such an icon in horror and thriller films that it becomes so hard for a person in my generation to come in this film fresh and be ignorant. This film is very effective as the story requires the audience to not have an idea of what is coming next.As I said before, I came into this knowing all the iconic scenes but luckily I did not know about the main twist at the end of the film. This film was based on a novel by Robert Bloch but developed to the screen by Joseph Stefano. I have not watched any other works by Joseph Stefano and I have not read Bloch's novel but yet due to popular culture the film kind of takes the fun out of watching this film. Though stripped off of it's suspense at times but the film's story story was still entertaining due to its characters. I admire the fact that the film decides to take an unexpected turn and switch the focus on Norman Bates rather than Marion Crane. I find Norman an interesting figure and is something of a mystery. I do tend to give a more positive rating to films that dives into human psychology, which is the reason I liked films like Identity. Lila Crane is a great substitute of a strong female character and doesn't sacrifice the presence of women, something that is lacking in this film in my opinion. The film overall is great and the character Norman Bates is something that have influenced future films.Alfred HItchcock has been labelled as the master of suspense. Though I haven't seen all of his films but I felt Psycho is one of the films that solidified his reputation. To me, this film ties up there with Hitchcock's other film Vertigo. The film still does feel like a product of its time and may feel a little date in its effects, like when a certain someone falls down the stairs, but I watched this with that mindset and not allowing its dated flaws to ruin my judgement of the film. Psycho is still something that should be watched by the current generation and, mystery and suspense fans.John L. Russell is the film's cinematographer and in this film he ensures that everything does, every angle and every camera movement, supports in creating tension and suspense. The camera, a lot of the time, follows the characters ensuring that our focus stays on them. Shadows are important in shaping the tone and supports the characters' personalities and intentions. Some of these scenes are so iconic in its cinematography that it has attributed to the film's influence. Hitchcock may have decided to have this film in black and white because it is much cheaper to photograph it that way but I think this style is also something that he desired to avoid that feeling of a set.Bernard Herrmann is a legendary composer who have worked on the most acclaimed films; Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver and North By Northwest but I think this is his most iconic as it has been used and talked about by either critics or the general public. The film's tense moments are accompanied by harsh strings that shocks you as it screeches. Without Herrmann's score then the film would not give that same effect as it would with it.The most crucial actor that must be chosen perfectly is the role of Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has embodied the role of this damaged man so convincingly that it is horrifying to even think it. Janet Leigh was terrific, her acting did not outshine anyone but certain moments in the film like the suspicious police officer, shows more to her than a pretty face. Martin Balsam as the private detective was one of the most enjoyable ones in this film. I did not expect much from him because the last film I have seen him in is Breakfast at Tiffany's and he did not really do much there.Solid cast, beautiful black and white cinematography, legendary score, and great direction has earned this film a classic status and will remain that way until the end of cinema. I adore the psychological aspect of this film and the choice of black and white photography. This film has shaped modern thrillers and will continue to do so.",Psycho

Being a fan of horror films, I've been told by everyone that this was the one I have to see. Talk about a reputation to live up to, I didn't honestly see how it could be as good as it was supposed to be. I recently had been hearing great things about A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum', and was disappointed in that, so my solely-based-on-reputation expectations were a little shot, plus I'd heard so much about the shower scene I figured that was the big payoff. Well, in a way that only Alfred Hitchcock can do it, any expectations I had were not only met but shattered. I cannot imagine the impact this movie must have had on audiences in 1960, even watching it forty years later on my DVD player with the volume turned down he rocked my world. If you're someone who hates top 200 lists because they're usually all the same, ignore the fact that this on every one and give it a chance, it honestly deserves any attention it's got over the years. All of the acting is solid, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) is believable in his difficult role and Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) gets scared with the best of em. The soundtrack is perfect, and there's some great cinematography in a few of the more dramatic moments, making Psycho' close to a perfect horror film. I'm going to jump on the bandwagon and say that if you haven't seen this movie yet, stop what you're doing and go rent it/buy it/steal it, whatever you need to do to watch it. Rating: 34/40",Psycho

462,realalexrice,Holds up,10,8 June 2021,"An essential film. For a movie whose greatness hinges on its pulsating perfect score, even Hitchcock thought so, it's still a full accomplishment with considerably great performances (specifically Perkins and Leigh), groundbreaking themes and images, iconic editing, and a compelling story. In addition, being a true gateway film for Hollywood to again reinvent itself and allow more risqué films from major studios and major directors. No one worked within but also pushed the bounds of censorship laws and regulations, that plagued many huge productions of the time, like Hitchcock did. Defining violence of the 60's before it would inevitably reinvent itself in movies such as Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Halloween, Psycho truly defined what the story outline of a modern slasher could choose to go with, and most likely make a serviceable picture. Even my mother, who hates horror movies, was bummed she couldn't see it and says she would still like to sometime... that's the power of Hitchcock, effectively making movies serviceable to everyone, but dense enough that those who want a challenge will get one (for his more complex movies), and that's the true definition of a master. Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors and normally I wouldn't speak so highly and definitively about something, I figured it was worth it for a man who made back to back to back critical outlines for their respective genres.If even possible anymore, go into this not knowing the plot.",Psycho
463,ringfire211,The absolute pinnacle of Hitchcock's genius!!!,10,15 December 2011,"My appreciation for this film has really gone through the roof! From the first time I saw it (maybe 8 years back) I knew it was my favorite Hitchcock. But after rewatching and totally being thrilled by NORTH BY NORTHWEST a few months ago I started to wonder if NBNW isn't almost as good as PSYCHO. Well, it's not. This most recent rewatch confirmed it. As great as NBNW is (oh believe me - it's great!!) PSYCHO is that much better. Far and away the best Hitch!! And almost everything that disturbed me about HALLOWEEN and made me look away from it I was drawn into and totally mesmerized by in PSYCHO. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is one of the most brilliant creations in film history! His conversation with Janet Leigh in the parlor is sooooo engaging that you're literally sitting there with your mouth agape. And need anyone say anything about the infamous shower scene?? Plus the B&W cinematography combined with Bernard Herrmann's amazing score really sets the creepy/paranoid mood of the film - sends shivers down your spine. Brilliant stuff!!",Psycho
464,jmholmes-73727,First movie of the modern era,10,1 October 2018,"Young audiences today no doubt find it hard to believe that a horror classic such as this could have been made without a thought toward youngsters going to see it. But PSYCHO was made when nearly all top quality directors were making movies routinely for adults. It would be another 8 or 10 years before studios would discover the youth market as perhaps an answer to their financial woes. Flash forward to the present when adults have to hunt for the elusive independent, unpublicized gems that are available today for them.
 Hence this thriller makes the audience wait 45 minutes for the first scare. That script would never get shot today. But when that scare came, it was a pip- killing the star off half way through! Something new had happened here, and Hitch became the first to insist no one be admitted to the theater after the movie had begun. At that time it was common for patrons to walk into movies at any time and stay to see the start of the next show up to the time they 
had come in. Hitch changed the way audiences went to the movies.
 It suddenly became okay for major stars and directors to develop nasty or violent projects that would always be a thorn in the side to conservative producers. Eight years after PSYCHO, Bonnie and Clyde would break new ground too with its technicolor bloodshed in that film.
 After all these years, it's still painful to decide which of his films is his best. Is it the cold brilliance of this, or the hauntingly beautiful tragedy of Vertigo - or the terrifying, inexplicable The Birds?",Psycho
465,Semih,Owes much of its quality to Bernard Herrmann's score.,9,6 June 2000,"Ofcourse Hitchcock is a great director. But try watching this movie without Bernard Herrmann's score and it will lose almost everything about it. Hitchcock wanted to shoot the shower sequence (most memorable but over-exagerated scene) without any music. Big mistake. Mr. Herrmann thought so too. And now it has become a masterpiece. Talking about the shower scene being over rated; my favorite scene in the film is where the lady is driving at night and it starts raining and she turns on the wipers and she keeps looking at the rear view mirror and then she finally ends up at the motel. That whole sequence is brilliant film making that owes much of its brilliance to Herrmann's score. You feel her anxiety because of her feeling of guilt for what she has done, and we as an audience have a feeling that there isn't something that pleasing awaiting her at the end of the road. How do we know that? Pay attention to how the fast pace of the string ensemble comes to an abrupt change with pizzicatos and low resonance bows, once we see the sign of the motel. And notice how the cue leads up to that part; pure genius at work here, ladies and gentleman. If it weren't for Herrmann's musical score, this film would be just an average movie.",Psycho

But the really weird thing is that Anthony Perkins did not win an Oscar for his role, a very difficult role to play I might add, as the psycho who kills his own mother and kills Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) in the shower. That was some scary stuff.This is one of the greatest films ever made and it's absurd that the academy would give Oscars to let's say Denzel Washington for Training Day, and not to Perkins or Hitchcock.

However this movie is definitely a masterpiece, and completely revolutionised cinema (by showing a flushing toilet funnily enough).
I'm trying to avoid the elephant in the room, or the shower scene, because it has been talked about to death. Yes it's a great scene, but Psycho is a lot more than just that
The acting is phenomenal, most notably Anthony Perkins who I would believe is actually insane because of his performance.
The film is also a technical masterpiece, as is expected from Hitchcock. To cram everything in would ruin you're experience. Even if you know the twist ending, it will still be shock and that is a testament to this films writing",Psycho

In my opinion this is movie perfection. From the beginning you know that Marion is (for 1960) a rather unscrupulous woman, but you like her. Albeit a poor decision-maker, she's strong and courageous.  You follow her along through her folly, wondering, `Will she get away with it?' Will she come to her senses?' And when she finally does with the help of poor, lovable, goofy Norman, the whole thing takes a twist that you could never have seen coming from a movie made back then. The cinematography is excellence, I have yet to see it's like again. The remake made a great attempt but it just didn't feel the same. The performances are as pure as Ivory soap.  This is the one movie that I can sit through time and again and it only makes me love it more. The man was a genius and obviously at the top of his craft here. That's my take. What's yours?",Psycho

The story is so simple and easy to follow, but Hitchcock brilliantly uses the late Joseph Stefano's screenplay to squeeze every bit of nerve and suspense out of the viewer (most notably in the two death scenes).The performances are all terrific, but the standout performance belongs to Perkins offering one of the most chilling portrayals your ever likely to see on screen.If you haven't seen this yet you're truly missing out on a great piece of cinema.

473,ChristianLeFeuvre,A true 'classic',10,1 May 2019,"One of the greatest films ever made, by one of the greatest directors in movie history.......
Janet Leigh stars as Marion Crane, who embezzles $40,000 from her employer and goes on the run. When she becomes tired whilst driving in the rain at night, she pulls into the 'Bates Motel' and meets Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins. Unfortunately, Marion's stay isn't as relaxing as she'd hoped and she is murdered whilst taking a shower.
There are so many things about this film that make it a genuine classic, from the direction to the brilliant cast and acting.
'Psycho' was so influential to future horror/slasher movies in so many ways, but what Hitchcock did so well was to make Norman Bates so opposite to the usual depiction of murderers in movies, he's not the typical unattractive loners who have difficulty in communicating with anyone, on the contrary, Anthony Perkins is a handsome guy who is very charming in this film, and Hitchcock makes him almost likeable, sensitive and makes the audience quite sympathetic towards him. When we first meet him he is so sweet-tempered and mild, and during a conversation with Marion we learn that he is under the control of a harsh, disciplinarian mother and is almost traumatised by her to the point that, despite being a grown man, he is almost child-like and this is made clearer by a line he says to Marion, 'A boy's best friend is his mother'. We even hear 'Mother' belittling Norman and shouting at him, seemingly jealous of any attractive female guests, and we then get that famous shower scene of 'mother' killing Marion.
The shower scene is still as effective as it was in the '60s when the film was released, especially with Bernard Herrmann's chilling score.
The way Hitchcock builds the suspense in this film, and how he overturns our expectations is unparalleled. The violence in 'Psycho' by today's standards is actually pretty tame and most of it is, in reality, down to the sound effects and the viewers' imagination. And this is what Hitchcock always insisted on, that any 'horror', and the 'scares' comes from the suggestion of violence. It's the way the audience's brains fill in the gaps of the things we don't actually see, that's what's scary, cause no matter what any film-maker can show, it can never be as scary as what our imaginations can come up with.
This movie didn't just have a surprise twist ending, or violent murder scenes, it told its story in a very unique way. Killing off the leading lady so early in the film, the sparse amount of characters, the remote location, the build-up of the tension all these were completely new to audiences at the time, and even today we don't see this done so often, and certainly not done as well as Hitchcock did it.
Nearly 60 years on from its first release, 'Psycho' remains incredibly influential and still very thrilling and scary.
A true 'classic' in every sense.",Psycho
474,merrywater,B/W is Best,10,18 October 2014,"Do we actually need color pictures? How come that this in that perspective so outdated movie still does its job so much better than colored counterparts?In fact, I ask myself why other film makers still insist on color instead of B/W knowing the impact of Psycho and Film Noir. There are some clever adaptations, though viz the bleak colors, such as in Seven, Sixth Sense and The Ring. Psychological horror tends to fade to gray.Well, despite all this, Hitchcock's the Suspense Master and Psycho is his best film. I'd like to compare to Agatha Christie's best story, the 6th most sold novel of all times, Ten Little N*****s aka And Then There Were None: there is something crude about both productions. TLN is not very elaborated in its language, rather straightforward. Yet, the background information about each victim is direct and convincing. The main plot is fantastic and the atmosphere the novel brings at least got me entangled in it.Now, Psycho on the other hand, has a less fantastic story: it could happen that a girl at large ends in a gloomy motel at the will of a mentally ill murderer. The similarity rather lies in the movie's lack of pretension, in stark contrast to say, Vertigo. Besides this comparison, it's noteworthy that Psychostarted of the slasher type flicks, complete with the eerie staccato musical score introduced and indulged in various new elements in film such as a toilet bowl close up is a two act movie: first act is about the female protagonist's stealing of money, the second is about the male protagonist's killing of her and his disturbed life lacks the typical Mac Guffin ingredient as the motivations for the protagonists are well introduced and of great importance to the plotdeals openly with sex topics as transvestism has a Christiesque the-detective-presents-the-crime-summing up in the final scene where the psychologist explains to the DA what has happened has a number of details from other movies, for instance, Norman Bates was not the innovative character it could have been since Orson Welles already invented the neurotic Motel Host in A Touch of Evil (1958) played by Dennis Weaver. In the same movie Janet Liegh was terrorized in the motel, as well, even making the choice of actress unoriginal. The corpse dumping method by means of putting it in a car trunk was used by Hitchcock in One More Mile to Go (1956).",Psycho
475,skiop,A flawed classic,3,16 January 2010,"1960 was in a way the beginning of modern horror. Before that, horror movies featured monsters and mythical creatures, and monster movie was synonymous with horror movie. This all changed in 1960 with the release of this movie and the inferior, controversial, career-destroying Peeping Tom. These movies showed the worst kind of monster: a human being.The plot follows that Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles money for herself and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). She stays overnight at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). It's not a surprise to anyone that Norman Bates is the villain of the movie. That is one of the primary problems with this movie: Norman is the only likable character in the entire movie. He's handsome, but shy and misunderstood, so he can't have a relationship outside of his voyeuristic fantasy life. This is a grave contrast to Marion Crane, a sleazy, immoral character.All is going well to this point; it looks like it might get interesting, but starting with Marion's murder, it takes a 180. Her murder is one of the worst (not most brutal) I've ever seen. While the killer is supposed to be stabbing her to death, the camera jerks all over the place. Epileptics should definitely skip this part. John Carpenter did a far better, less obvious obscuring of graphic murders 18 years later in his Halloween.The movie then goes from bad to worse, as we observe some of the going ons in a small town, with Sam and Marion's sister, Lila (Vera Miles). Here is where it gets really boring, showing us inconsequential pieces of small-town life. Unlike Halloween, which was based on the introduction of a madman into the everyday life of babysitters, Psycho's second half is little more than filler. There is essentially no connection between the first half and the second or between the second half and the first. It just meanders for a half hour or so.The climax really comes out of nowhere. The special effects aren't that good (in fact, they're awful), but it is the best part of the movie: Sam tackling knife-wielding, cross-dressed Norman and the following scene providing a glimpse into Norman's mind, something that nothing before that had done.",Psycho
476,ufo0001,Classic Hitchcock,9,1 May 2002,"Pros: Janet leigh, Cinematography, Directing, Score.Cons: Janet leigh is in only half the movie.Psycho isn't Hitchcock's best movie (the honor belongs to rear window) but probably the master of suspense most suspenseful and ultimately scary. Janet leigh plays a secretary who steals for the sake of her boyfriend and is on the run from the law. She happens upon the bates motel and is promptly murdered before the night is done. Bernard herrmann provides a masterful score matched by hitchcock's camera work. Hitchcock's movies tends to have a twist and psycho is probably the best out of all his movies. Only vertigo comes close. Anthony Perkins should have won an oscar for his portrayal of Norman Bates as he is the real star of the film. It gets a bit corny at the end.Premise: The death of a young woman leads to an investigation into the bates motel.Psycho was nominated for four Academy awards and is a winner of the AFI top 100 movies.Grade: 9.7/10 (One of the best thrillers of all time)",Psycho

So when Psycho hit screens, the audience was finally introduced to psychological thrillers. It hit with such a huge bang that the audience was shocked...with fear and suspense. Psycho created what the thriller genre is today. It sliced through clique monster movies and changed it forever. Still today when you look at Norman Bates and his extremely freaky look when you see him watching the inspector's car sinking into the swamp sends chills down my spine. And when Marion Crane met her bloody demise in the middle of the movie, Hitchcock proved to everyone that this movie is different, different from every other movie you have ever seen. The cinematography in this movie is fabulous, the music is marvelously freaky, the acting is magnificent, the story is exceptional, and everything else about the movie is great.

480,stewiefan201,"A landmark in horror history housing one of the greatest, if not the greatest, movie villain in history,",10,17 October 2008,"Psycho is a landmark in horror movie history. Alfred Hitchcock uniquely directed the first ever slasher movie, and did so with wit, quality, and absolute brilliance. Psycho is the first Alfred Hitchcock movie I've seen, and I am very impressed by it. Now I've seen lots and lots of slasher flicks in my day, but never have I seen one anywhere near the caliber of Psycho.Psycho is about a young woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). While she's at work one day, out of the blue she decides to steal 40,000 dollars in cash from an investor. She goes on the run telling nobody where she is going, and soon becomes paranoid and wary of her surroundings, and also the people around her. On a particularly rainy night, Marion stops at the Bates Motel where she meets the odd owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman invites her to eat dinner with him, and takes a considerable liking to her. At first he seems like a regular nice guy, but it turns out that he does have a dark side after all. Norman's ""mother"" is a very controlling woman, and as it turns out may be a murderer as well. Using Norman to cover up her vicious attacks. Marion goes missing, and tensions and suspense raise to unbearable heights as Marion's sister and boyfriend, and also a private investigator, begin looking for her. Leading them all the way up to none other than the Bates Motel...and Norman ""himself"".This is the greatest horror movie I've ever seen, and definitely one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The suspense is built up incredibly, and the story's twists and turns are amazing. I could never successfully guess what was going to happen next in this movie. And you can't say that about most slasher movies these days. After watching Psycho I realize how much recent slasher films blatantly rip off Hitchcock's masterpiece. However Psycho will now remain an unmovable cinema classic in my eyes, and those new age ripoffs will not. It amazes me how a film that is nearly 50 years old, and in black and white, can still terrify audiences. It's simply astonishing what Hitchcock created here.Now I'll get into the film itself. Just about everything is done right in Psycho. The editing is among some of the best I've ever seen. The cinematography really helps a lot of scenes, and only adds to the terror. Take the ""shower scene"" scene for example: It was shot in such a way that you couldn't see any nudity; and I also appreciated how the scene starts up very bright, and as the dark sinister figure moves closer to the curtains, you get that ominous feeling that tells you that something very bad is about to happen. The acting is also very good. Janet Leigh gives a strong performance, and I'm telling you to keep an eye on her facial expressions, because they reveal her character's paranoia and regret. But the real star of the show, the reason the movie is called Psycho, is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins plays one of the best villains of all time, and one of my personal favorites. You don't know what is going on with this guy. At first he seems normal, then he's covering up a murder with a boyish grin on his face, and then you get to his real personality underneath. Perkins plays Norman as a complete mama's boy who stutters under pressure, and on the spot tries to think up ways to cover up his ""mother's"" murders. At first it seems to be an average performance, but then you begin to notice how Perkins makes his character stutter with nervous ticks, and laughing when he makes a joke. It's the tiny details, of which there are quite a few, that make Perkins performance into one of the scariest movie villains in history.Psycho is an ingenious horror film because it blends natural horror with great acting, surprising twists, red herrings, suspense, and a constant sense that something is very bad is about to happen. Hitchcock has created the best horror I've ever seen. After 50 years it is still suspenseful and terrifying, and that is the mark of a brilliant filmmaker. I can't wait to see more of Hitchcock's movies. Psycho gets a 5 out of 5 from me.",Psycho
481,Oggz,Mean Strings,10,14 December 2018,"How do you write about, let alone review something that's been picked apart and assembled again, stretched into 24 hour performances by lesser artists, copied, imitated, quoted, spoofed, franchised, and even remade shot for shot? About something that has been appreciated, raved about and even worshipped for nearly 60 long years by audiences, devotees and eventually even critics?There are reasons for all that. John Gavin may have been wooden but Vera Miles was good enough, Janet Leigh and Robert Balsam were exceptionally good and Perkins was sensational. It was Robert Bloch's best achievement in lurid pulp, Stefano's best screenwriting moment and Hitch was quite literally at the height of his powers. So were his wife Alma and assistant Peggy, who also sensed how times were changing and how the audiences were ready for something never before attempted or seen - a film with moments so pounding and visceral that it would end up changing the entire ballgame.And then there's the score, equally deeply ingrained on our culture. ""Hitchcock does about two thirds of his films - I finish them for him"" - Herrmann would say, and it's been true from Harry through to Marnie. This one contains the most famous musical cue of all times and a neurotic, hurtling main title to boot, but it is the slow bits, during which Hitch handles the passage of time, trouble, unease, mystery, suspense and degradation that are just superb, allowing for some of the most exciting moments ever commited to film. Elegant and decidedly modern, all the more lethal for its reduction to a chamber string orchestra, the score is well produced too; loads of sticky reverb and compression were slapped on those ferocious shrieks, making them always sound a bit limp on later recordings - and certainly lacking that thoroughly ripping effect. Luckily, Hitch gave in and went along with his composer.To wrap it up - the less said about Psycho, the better - and it is best enjoyed in silence and darkness. It has a flaw or two but its unique, darkly unsettling magic speaks for itself even today and it still feels like an exceptionally modern, cool, groundbreaking film. Whatever Walt Disney may have thought of it.",Psycho
482,carljessieson,A Horrifying Work of Art,9,6 September 2010,"By today's standards, the murder scenes are laughable, but I know that back in 1960, this movie was terrifying.Alfred Hitchcock is definitely a master. The way that he used music and editing made some scenes really frightening to me. I feel like the music was the most effective way that Hitchcock got into my head and stressed me out. Even in some scenes where nothing was happen, that music came on and I was scared. I was grabbing onto my friend and biting my fingers. The night after I watched this, I had to lock my door, check my bathroom for a hidden creep, and think of happy things until I fell asleep. It left a lasting impression on me, definitely. The conclusion is insane! It is a freaky film.The actors were great, minus the murder scenes. They were calm when they had to be, scared when they had to be, and creepy as hell when they had to be. I will never see the remake of this film, because I really doubt that anybody could ever fulfill these roles better than Perkins and Leigh did.Hitchcock really knows which angles to use, what editing techniques work, all the things that make this a good movie. The content is scary, the form is excellent. I completely understand why this film is iconic, why it has been brought up so often in society. This is the movie that made motels kind of creepy places, I bet.I would buy this movie, sure. It's recommended.

However despite all this Psycho was still, to me frightening. I first watched it on TV and thought it a well done thriller. Having watched it in movies class again, I couldn't believe how much the film had scared me. The now infamous shower scene(infamous to the point it's not even a spoiler), although looking a little dated, frightened me. A lot of it had to do with the music. The music and clever camera angles make this very effective, especially the music. Despite all the sppofs where you hear the music, this is the only time the music proves effective. Also acting ranging from competent to, in Perkins case great, helps the film along as well.In today's age where exploitation films have gone from an underground genre to commercial and mainstream, films like Psycho will always produce more fear then all the Saw and Hostel films put together.8/10",Psycho

Alright, well enjoy your stay and see you in the morning. Or maybe not. Alfred Hitchcock was one of the most influential and fiendishly wonderful movie makers of the twentieth century. Before ""Psycho"", I had seen exactly 22 of Hitchcock's pictures. Most of them I enjoyed but none of them were as memorable as this piece of work. It is not just a cinematic accomplishment but also of successfully portraying someone who is indeed psycho. This movie was a shock when released in 1960 because of the way the movie was laid out. For example, it was unthinkable for a main character to be killed so early in the film. The goal was to put the audience on edge to the point where they had no idea what would happen next. And Hitchcock indeed pulled it off. In fact, he was sure to make clear that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie had begun. You must watch it from beginning to end. I am not going to tell you the plot because the less you know, the better. They don't call Alfred Hitchcock the master of suspense for nothing.",Psycho

The film that cemented Hitchcock's star in the hall of cine-fame, Psycho narrates the infamous story of Norman Bates and his warped motel, inhabited by the elusive silhouette of his over-bearing mother. When a beautiful young runaway flees work with a chunk of her employer's money, of course her first thought is to check into the nearest motel, inevitably leading to one of the most notoriously scary scenes in cinema. Worth a watch in all kinds of weather, the film was nominated for four Academy Awards upon release and features a young Janet Leigh and a handsome Anthony Perkins.

Fifty-nine years later ""Psycho"" still grips you with the same energy that made it a hit in 1960.The story is so well known at this point that I don't think I need to summarize it here. What I will say to those who haven't yet seen ""Psycho"" is forget everything you think you know about Hitchcock, horror films, or classic movies. ""Pyscho"" defies all expectations with its beautiful black and white cinematography, Bernard Herrmann's now infamous score, and of course Anthony Perkins' iconic performance as Norman Bates - one of the greatest villains of all time.

490,judemcrobbie,Hitchcock at his best,9,17 February 2021,"Sir Alfred Hitchcock may just be the best director of all time. This movie shows why. He masters the art of the unsettling, everything screams that something isn't right. This could be from the opening credits not being lined up geometrically like the majority of movies or how he does not even give you the comfort of numbers when describing time or location. The score is also horrifying for the scene, setting the unnerving tone early, as soon as that motif starts. The majority of the movie is long takes and narrow shots. The narrow shots give you the sense of claustrophobia, making you want to step back but obviously you can't. The long takes make you think they're lingering too long, making you feel you've overstayed your welcome and taking awkward to a different level.
I'm unaware of how Hitchcock makes this possible, but the most average and boring tasks undertaken by our lead, for the first half anyway, make us squirm. Never before have I been so petrified by watching someone buy a car or talk to a police officer, its truly a marvel to watch.
So much of the movie is silence, which Hitchcock utilises perfectly. He uses it in 3 ways: To create an awkward/unnerving silence between characters, for characters by themselves and to actually illustrate how quiet it is in a set place. All of these are in the hope, and they do, create suspense and tension between characters and just the environment in general.
Anthony Perkins' (Norman Bates) ability to create this character that we are so unsure about, leading us at the start to believe he's something we think he isn't but ultimately is. This through the dialogue and through his body language throughout the whole film.
The movie is so unnerving that despite there not being many jump scares at all, the one that are there are so scary. The movie has you so unnerved at time that literally the jump between dialogue and silence and vice versa is enough to make your heart skip a beat.
The amount of twists implemented through the movie keeps you off balance so well that they, in of themselves, get to you
I have only seen 5 horror as of writing this (Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, The Conjuring 1&2 and The Nun) so I'm not particularly adept to say this but this could just be one of the scariest movies ever made, it certainly was the scariest I've watched.",Psycho

But there have been a few that I've see that are really good. Psycho is a good film but time has passed it by, it is a movie out of time and just does not carry the punch it did in 1960.Technology advances degrade much of technique used in this film. Audiences today are too sophisticated to be drawn into a film like this. Modern horror movies depend heavily on special effects and not on the subtleties used in Psycho. Being released in black & white is an advantage and helps give the film a feel of being the classic it is.Anthony Perkins is superb in the role as Norman Bates. Other than Martin Balsam and Perkins though, the rest of the actors deliver only average performances. The lines are rigid and often lame, again the effect of time passing the method by. Perkins however can take the worst role and give it smoothness.I'll not reveal any spoilers but for a movie so referenced and so often used in comedy and serious pieces, it is impossible to see this movie today without knowing what happens to the main characters.",Psycho

What makes a scary movie for me is not jump scares I feel they are a cheap way to get a scare. But the ability to make the viewer constantly feel creeped out is what makes a horror movie.The plot was great for the majority of the film I just have one issue which I speak about later not a huge thing but definitely something to mention.Negative:
There were a couple of cheesy moments but you have to remember when this movie was made and understand that movies back then were not as developed.Music was a little much at times but wasn't all that bad.Now at the point where the first death happens is where I have somewhat of an issue.

494,arichmondfwc,Anthony's Norman,10,19 May 2017,"Getting into Hitchcock's Psycho, 57 years after its original release is like assisting to a masterclass of sorts. We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself, naturally, but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville - Hitch's wife - took over, re edited and the results have been praised, applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling, as moving, as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film, shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings - it's pretty fantastic. - Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem, we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad - not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity, the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying, very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins.",Psycho

But it is PSYCHO that has become synonymous with Hitchcock. It is PSYCHO that has become synonymous with screaming and blood and knives and schizophrenia and horror.If ever anybody has made a perfect movie, PSYCHO is it. It is the penultimate in shocking horror, a directorial masterpiece supported by acting that will never be surpassed. The stars aligned for this movie, and it is doubtful if a movie can ever surpass the greatness of this film.The points have been hashed and rehashed over and over again: Perkins' incredible acting, the plot twists, the sheer twistedness of the movie, the place it holds as the father of the modern horror movie. All of it amazing.
No scene has been more popular in the annals of film than the shower scene (Oh sure, GONE WITH THE WIND and CASABLANCA and CITIZEN KANE have memorable lines, but what movie has a minutes-long scene that is internationally famous?). Unfortunately, its notoriety makes it somewhat of a disappointment to watch now, but repeat viewings reinforce the technical beauty of the scene where the original horror was lost.But enough, as anything said will only add more hype to a movie that does not need it.

497,Millennialprince,Psycho,9,11 November 2019,"Psycho is the iconic horror movie that created the slasher genre. This seminal film has influenced everything from Halloween to Scream. It has a great script, great direction by Hitchcock, an iconic score by Bernard Herrmann, and a chilling turn by Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. The only weak link is the exposition dump delivered by the psychiatrist in the last ten minutes of the film I found it totally superfluous. Now I know the monologue was meant to explain Norman Bates's pathology but it comes across as way too expository. I guess audiences back in 1960, needed to have that monologue to understand Norman Bates' psychosis. In today's climate movie goers are far more sophisticated, so I guess that speech was acceptable back in 1960.

498,chimera3,An Undisputed Masterpiece,10,8 September 2017,"Ever since I was a kid, I always loved watching vintage horror movies. When I got older, my mom started telling us more and more about Alfred Hitchcock's movies and invited us to watch as many as we could. If my memory serves, the very first two Hitchcock movies that I ever watched were ""Psycho"" and ""The Birds."" Like Stephen King after him, Hitchcock made you unable to trust your surroundings, whether it be something simple like a motel or just walking down the street and see a group of birds sitting on power lines.What angers me about this is that it was poorly remade later on and it just didn't have the same type of scares as the first one. You do not need a horror movie to be in color to have it be scary. ""Psycho"" was done exclusively in black and white and that's all there was to it. If something like this can scare you once, it can certainly scare you again no matter how many times you watch it. ""Psycho"" is definitely a masterpiece that no matter how many times you try to do it, you cannot duplicate it. It has been parodied many times on TV shows and music videos, which goes to show that people will keep coming back to it to get the daylights scared out of them. In the end, let me say this: if it isn't broke, don't fix it. If you want to truly be scared out of your wits and be paranoid about checking into a motel, watch this.",Psycho

PSYCHO is such a classic and influential movie in so many ways.PSYCHO is the story of a woman named Marion (Janet Leigh) who goes to stay at a hotel run by a sweet, lighthearted, yet still somewhat creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who lives in a house nearby with his mother. Little does Marion know, somebody in that house is a deranged freak. She ends up being killed that same night she checks in, in the infamous shower scene that will ALWAYS be a classic moment in film history. The rest of the movie is basically the murder scene being investigated, and everything is brought up to one of the most chilling and shocking conclusions you can imagine.What else can I say about PSYCHO? Great in every aspect. Acting, scripting, casting, directing (of course)... everything is so natural and subtle. The way that Hitchcock prepares everything for the viewer ultimately leads to total surprise when you least expect it.There's really not much else I can say about this movie, not much more praise I can give.

Usually I enjoy both the dialogs and visuals from a Hitchcock movie but in this the only dialog I remember was during the start'He was flirting with you, he must have noticed the ring on my hand'. On the visual side however the noticeable, innovation (must have been at that time) was the height at which the house (of the Norman) was located, it must have been the camera angle too, that every time you look at it, it gives you a spooky feeling, so just the angle did it! The concept of the movie however is the thing that has taken it to the top of the list (I guess), which has been used in several movies by now but must have been a novelty at that time. The lead actor's performance is the best in the movie, even though in the starting one might think that it can't be him, it must be the lady herself or her lover but this guy gets into the frame perfectly and unfolds himself with each dialog. On the whole a good movie but Rear window still remains my favorite Hitchcock movie.",Psycho
503,colm-hearne365,Hitchcock's Best Movie Ever!,9,14 November 2012,"Alfred Hitchcock is one of my favourite directors and I've seen a lot of his movies and this is truly his best work. I mean before I saw Psycho, all I really knew about it was the famous shower scene which I saw references to in parodies or cartoons or something like that. But this movie turned out to be one of my all-time favourites even though I'm not that big into horror films.I like how Hitchcock decided to do the film in black-and-white because it makes it darker and suspenseful. The story starts out somewhat slow, but I like the conversations going on as Marion is driving on the highway, one of the most suspenseful parts of the movie. But the magic really begins when it gets to the Bates Motel. I'm surprised Anthony Perkins never got an Oscar or even a nomination for his portrayal of Norman Bates, I mean he was born to play that role! I can't imagine any other actor playing him. I mean you can see that there's something suspicious about Norman but you can't figure it out. But he just seems like a nice, friendly person who ""wouldn't even hurt a fly."" And what surprises me even more is that he didn't star in any other well-known movies after Psycho. That just shows how underrated he is as an actor. But I'm glad at least Janet Leigh got a nomination for playing Marion Crane and won a Golden Globe.The one scene that really freaked me out, and still does, is when Lila Crane discovers Norman Bates's mother's corpse in the fruit cellar, and then Norman comes in dressed as his mother and carrying a knife and revealing that he is the murdering mother. I wasn't expecting that in anyway at all. I can just imagine what people would've thought about that because movies were much tamer back then. This movie makes me afraid of walking in a dark room because I always have the feeling a shadowy figure might pop out and stab me to death. I've also watched the two Psycho sequels that were made in the 80s and they're good enough to watch but they're nothing compared to the original. But I still think the work well.Overall this movie has everything that makes a movie a masterpiece: excellent acting, excellent directing, excellent writing, excellent cinematography, excellent suspense and even an excellent twist. It's pretty much perfect in every way. In conclusion, thank you Alfred Hitchcock for creating this movie and may you rest in peace.",Psycho

Now those of you who haven't seen the original don't be confused or misled by the word ""horror.""  Most people today when they hear the word horror think of the likes of Jason or Freddy or Dracula hacking and biting people to a bloody pulp and leaving us with a very gross looking corpse on the the screen and a sick twisting feeling in our stomachs.  Horror, according to the dictionary, means a state of suspense or tension; unfortunately, today one can't call a movie a horror film without gore. When people today for the first time see Psycho think that this movie isn't scary enough or gory enough to be considered horror.   I must admit that I was at first trapped into that state of mind, but then I soon realized that Psycho is not a horror in the sense of gore or fright factor, but a horror in the sense that you are on the edge of your seat wanting to know what is going to happen and when it does happen you are shocked and sometimes disturbed by what has just occurred.What adds to the mystery, suspense, and yes horror to it all is the fact that you don't know how the movie is going to end; unfortunately, I found out what the ending was going to be before seeing the movie.  So I beg you all, don't tell others who haven't seen this film what the ending is going to be, because that is where I was the most scared in the entire movie.

506,nunoaraujoduarte,movieinthepark.blogspot.com,10,17 January 2012,"Probably Alfred Hitchcock's most famous and recognised movie. Personally I can't find an explanation for its ratings, it probably lies in its originality, mostly concerning when it was made. Psycho portrays a story of this woman from Pheonix, Lila Crane (Vera Miless) who stole 40000$ from one client and runs away. She draws the attention from the police, so she decides to change cars and drives by night until she gets lost and finds a motel. She checks in in that motel, with a very peculiar keeper, Norman (Anthony Perkins), who revealed a very cool personality, indifferent to current paradigms, who lived with her very annoying mother, increasingly senile. Anyway, somebody enters her bathroom when she was in the shower and stabs her several times, presumably the insane mother. The missing money causes discomfort back in Pheonix and when her client finds out she's also missing he hires a private detective to look for her. He eventually gets to the Motel, but he is kileef as well, this time inside Normans' house, suspecting he'd be hiding Mrs Crane. Then, it's time for her boyfriend and sister to look for her. It's a fine movie. Very old school, no one dares to make such a bizarre movie nowadays. Probably inaccurate concerning the psychopathology involved, naturally to help the twist, which is perhaps spectacular but definitely repeated and copied too frequently over the years turning it predictable. It arouses quite a curiosity on Vera Miles as we're used to watch her in Westerns, a lot less demanding though emotionally richer. There's probably a lot of subjectivity or taste interfering with my rating, but when it comes to art, taste comes before justification. 6/10",Psycho

508,CinematicGarbage,Still the greatest horror movie today!,9,8 May 2019,"Psycho was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and was released on June 16th 1960. It was such an iconic scene which made Hitchcock known as a master of making such a horror masterpiece. It wasn't just a horror movie, it was also a thriller and a mystery which made us really curious about the crimes. We always wanted to know who commited it, who was the victim and what clues were left behind.
It was about a Phoenix secretary embezzles forty thousand dollars from her employer's client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. Hitchcock's Studio, Paramount Pictures, wasn't sure enough and disliked the film so they denied him a proper budget and the it was $800,000. The movie was in black and white. They even built a Bates Motel mansion at Universal. Psycho was Hitchcock's best work while he had done some thrillers and horrors like Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963). All of those were one of Hitchcock's greatest works.
Hitchcock also made rules for audiences for watching this film.
""You must see PSYCHO from the very beginning. Therefore, do not expect to be admitted into the theatre after the start of each performance of the picture. We say no one -- and we mean no one -- not even the manager's brother, the President of the United States, or the Queen of England (God bless her)!""
-Alfred Hitchcock-
They were really strict and lucky for me, I'm not a person from the 60s so I can watch whenever I want.
The performances were excellent and I mostly like Anthony Perkin's role of Norman Bates. Perkins was good-looking and that's exactly how Hitchcock wanted it to be just like that so Bates would look like a very likeable person with a charming character and made audiences believe him. They would think about him. Bates even disguised before he kill so that the victims would think it wasn't Bates maybe? He could have not dress because the victims would be dead and they wouldn't know. The way the iconic scene: the shower scene was pretty scary with its noise and when Marion Crane opened her eyes dying made the scene more terrifying and the way she was buried in the swamp was mostly frightening. She was naked and her things were in there. I knew it would be a good idea to bury your victim like that. What a genius! The story was told in a unique way. Even though the movie didn't have much violence, but the mystery were also dreadful and made us worry about what really had happened. It's also a great idea to shoot this movie not in technicolor but still remained black and white. That way would make Psycho a horror masterpiece no one could make like that.
Psycho was really influential, the greatest work of Alfred Hitchcock and also the greatest horror movie and it still deserved that title until today, it's still terrifying and scared a lot of audiences. It's also a combination of horror, terror, violence, mystery and thriller. I would recommend this a must-see for horror fans.My ratings: 9.7/10",Psycho

Hitchcock took a story and made it his masterpiece. Scary from start to finish, keeping you on the edge of your seat and asking yourself questions like, Are there people like Norman Bates in my world?
Masterly filmed in Black and White with a cracking music score that makes it even more impairing.
Hitchcock funded the film himself by mortgaging his house, as none of the film companies believed in Psycho.

It isn't like he's waving around butcher knives and she says, ""Hmm, well, I think I'll go take a shower now!""  The conversation in Norman's parlour ends on a pleasant note (after having navigated through some very dark material) and she leaves to go prepare for bed - she couldn't have suspected what was about to happen or the audience would have suspected it too - the killing wouldn't have been a shock at all. Another thing about these 'real' characters.  Arbogast starts out hard-boiled, but his conversatin with Norman in the motel office seems so real to the point where I suspect that the dialogue was ad-libbed.  But of course Hitchcock wouldn't have allowed that.  But the dialogue doesn't sound scripted at all.  It's all in the delivery - very effective, we get to see that Arbogast is very good at his job - not an amateur at all.  When Sam and Lila go to the motel to do their own investigation, there is inspired dialogue that you wouldn't hear in a conventional horror film.  For one thing, when they enter the bathroom, the scene of the earlier carnage, Sam matter-of-factly remarks ""there's no shower curtain"".  It's just a coment, and neither character dwells on this miniscule of details - how could they have guessed that it was used to wrap Marion's body with before she was dumped in her car trunk?  As well, when Sam decides to occupy Norman while Lila searches the house, he says ""If you find anything, anything at all, don't stop to tell me"".  See?  Again, this wouldn't have occurred in a regular movie. The characters are intelligent and think out their actions before they act on them.  And while Lila is put in the position of choosing to either run out the back door of Norman's house or down the flight of stairs and into the basement, she chooses the stairs (famous horror movie mistake) not because she is stupid, but because she is curious and wants nothing else but to find out what happened to her sister. It's one thing to have a main character massacred halfway through the film, but it's a much different movie that show's the intricate clean up of the crime scene - the mopping up of the blood, the wiping of the floor, walls and bathtub, the careful disposal of the body, etc, etc.  While the murder last for less than 30 seconds, the clean up goes on for 10 minutes, and makes the scene far, FAR more disturbing.  Watching dutiful Norman clean up his 'Mother's' mess, looking at the blood on his hands, smiling happily as the car sinks below the surface of his backyard swamp...well, it reaches a level of 'disturbing' that most movies hope to achieve but never reach. And the last line:  ""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly....""  Enough said.",Psycho

The first half hour of the movie was kinda like a crime movie. It showed Janet Leigh stealing 40,000 dollars from her boss. then she drives far away to Touson,Arizona to find her sister. But she gets tired, so she pulls the car over and rests. In the morning she is woken up by a cop, she tries to flee. but he asks for her ID. then she goes to a car dealership, to get a new car, 'cause the same cop from before is following her. she gets a new car very quickly,and is acting very suspisicous. then she buys the car,in cash. she continues driving, but it's raining bad, she put the wipers on. but she can't at all. then she sees the big bright ""Bate's motel"" sign, and pulls over. then she checks in and the motel manager,Norman Bates, a very lonely mama's boy. he seems like a nice person, she checks in under a fake name. then Norman goes to his creepy-ass house on a hill with steps right next to the motel, to get Marion some food. Marion goes into her room and hears from the house, Norman and his mom arguing. then Norman comes down the hill with the food. then him and Marion have a talk, and he says his mom is bed-ridden. after their talk, Marion goes back to her cabin. moments later, she takes a shower, which turns out to be the most shooking and most effective scence in film. Marion gets stabbed and killed by Norman who's dressed up as his mom. Hitchcock does it so brilliantly and dosen't show a single stab, also the movie's black and white so he used chocolate that goes down the drain just like blood. Another terrifying and clever scence is when a detective goes to the Bate's house to question the mom about Marion. as he goes up the stairs, a door opens a crack, then out of nowhere comes Norman, who stabs the detective, he falls down the stairs and the camera falls with him. how you find out Bate's is the killer, is Marion's sister and Marion's boyfriend go to the motel, they never heard from the detective. they pose as a couple, and Marion's sister goes up to the house,while Marion's boyfriend questions Bates, she finds Mrs. Bates, who turns out to be dead in a chair,she screams,and up pops Norman dressed as his mother and talking in his mom's voice. he has a split personality. one of the scariest and most original films of all time. it also opened up the doors to a new horror genre,slasher. very effective!",Psycho

Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is one of the greatest performances ever and he makes Bates such a spooky and memorable character.Many may think the most frightening in Psycho is the famous shower scene, but that ending scene where Norman Bates gives a smile to the camera is truly haunting and unforgettable.Psycho has some of the best cinematography i've ever seen, the camera angles and cuts makes every scene extremely unique and interesting.

517,charbelelaro,Groundbreaking,10,4 April 2018,"Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock is a crime thriller which follows a woman who unexpectedly steals money from her boss with the intentions of running away with her boyfriend, so they can start a new life together. Although her plan takes drastic turns as she is faced with many unforeseen complications and danger. This film is a clear example as to why Hitchcock is praised as being the master of suspense. Psycho keeps you captivated for the entire runtime. The script manipulates the audience with sharp obscure dialogue. The incredible screenplay is accompanied by oscar worthy performances, particularly by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. His character of Norman Bates is easily one of the most compelling aspects of the film. His peculiar nature makes him such a complex and well established character. The music, cinematography and editing work together beautifully, creating such an uneasy and eerie tone. For its time, Psycho was groundbreaking. It subverted the formulaic structures of the crime genre, as well as pushed boundaries surrounding what was tolerated during its social context. Psycho is still insanely nail biting and truly horrifying. It holds up incredibly well, in terms of entertainment value. But beneath all that it is one of the most well made movies of all time. Psycho is outstanding and that is why I give it a 10.",Psycho
518,saeedahmedsasoli,Definitely one of the best.,10,28 November 2020,"Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be.",Psycho
519,YellowManReanimated,A Groundbreaking Classic,9,26 June 2021,"The '60s marked a major shift in cinema across Europe and America. In Hollywood, the decade began with a strict censorship code, stagey violence, films shot in studio sets and only the vaguest allusions to sex, and narcotics. By the end of the decade, censorship had ended, location shooting had become standard practice, and sex, drugs and a greater sense of realism had permeated the art-form. Thus, the '60s is where the aesthetics of the cinema that we are familiar with today meaningfully took shape.Bearing the above in mind, it might seem strange to regard Psycho as an iconic film of the '60s: it was, after all, made under strict conditions of censorship, filmed mainly in studios, and features classic Hollywood artificiality, including supposed driving which involved characters moving fake steering wheels against the backdrop of a large projector. And yet, for all of its surface appearance, Psycho was a film that truly helped to break the taboos which existed in cinema at the time.Think of the infamous shower scene, iconic in and of itself, ingenious editing made us believe that we had seen a naked woman stabbed to death in front of our eyes. And yet, somehow, nothing had actually been shown that broke the code. Think of the moral ambiguity of the closest thing the film has to a heroine: she is on the move after stealing money from her workplace in order to set up a life for herself and the man with whom she's having an affair. Think of the themes the film explores: transvestism, incestuous desire, necrophilia, it doesn't get much more subversive than that.This film, for all of its surface appearance, truly broke boundaries in terms of being rawer and more unfiltered than mainstream Hollywood cinema had hitherto been able to be. As a result, I regard it as one of the most iconic films of the '60s.",Psycho

522,Brandon Hall,Alfred Hitchcock's Best,10,12 June 2002,"This movie is really the earliest horror film that everyone knows. It deals with a young man named Norman Bates managing a motel that his mother once owned. What role does the mother play in this film? A big one! Even though we only see her one time in the entire film she is one of the main characters. (Possible Spoilers) Norman Bates killed his mother and her lover in bed because he was jealous of her. After he killed her (as stated in Psycho IV) he still needed her and wanted her around so he stole her corpse from the grave and talked to her as if she were still alive. When the film starts we are first introduced to Marion Crane who steals $40,000 from the real estate company that she works for, she then darts for it and before you know it she ends up at the Bates Motel. When she first arrives she is charmed by Norman, offering her sandwiches and milk. But soon she hears Norman's mother talking and realizes that he has a rather dark side to him, the say goodnight and go to bed... or so you think. Soon after we see one of the most well known death scenes in cinematic history-- the macabre shower scene where Marion is stabbed to death by an unknown woman like figure which in the end turns out to be Norman Bates dressed as his mother. When Norman's mother first does the killing he has no idea what he is doing because the ""mother"" in him takes over and Norman blacks out and after he awakens he cleans up the bloody mess in which he believes that his mother has commited. There is much that this film has to offer, Alfred Hitchcock is a true genius! Psycho is one of the most horrific films in history. It is my favorite series of movies.

Every shot is memorable and when I think of either the horror or the thriller genre, the shower scene instantly comes to mind, as well as the other scenes with suspense in the film. Everything feels so meticulously placed in that the suspense hits you the same way a song approaches a bombastic crescendo.The genre has come a long way and today's generation's expectations are more harder to please due to the market in the genre, but 'Psycho' laid out the blueprint to making a thriller that has basically become the standard and you can see it in pretty much every modern suspense film, it's ridiculous. And while this might not shake up anyone today, this definitely shook up many people and to watch it in that context really shows how far we've come in the genre today.And with that, I think it's safe to say that Hitchcock rightfully deserves the title as 'the master of suspense.' And with other classics under his belt, such as 'Vertigo,' 'North by Northwest, and 'Rear Window,' his diversity in utilizing the concept of suspense, whether its playing with his audience's perceptions or leaving them on the edge of their seats, is evident in each of them. As a growing movie lover (my first love being music), I have to say that despite its status in pop culture lore, 'Psycho' is still a crowning achievement in what it basically is: a great movie.",Psycho

Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in ""Easy Rider""?  Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks.  Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in ""Magic"".

After the bra-and-slip clad Leigh does some final cuddling with her shirtless man (didn't I tell you, risqué?)we learn that she is tired of being his lover ""on the down-low"", as we would say today, and is getting anxious for him to make an honest woman out of her (in other words, marriage). But Sam is in tight financial times due to his ex-wife and doesn't want to marry Marion when he can't offer her a very comfortable lifestyle.Shortly after returning to her office, Marion is trusted with $40,000.00 cash given to her boss by a client, which she is supposed to deposit at his bank for him. After getting permission to leave the office early . . . well, she has the money there in her car with her, she and her man need it to start a real life together . . . you see where this is going. Marion is by no means a thief by nature or a hardened person, but this is more temptation than she can withstand. She heads to Phoenix to her boyfriend, imagining all kinds of conversations in her mind: Her man's reaction when he sees her unexpectedly, her boss's reaction when he realizes that both she and the money he had given her are missing, not to mention the irate client "" . . . I'll track her down, never you doubt it. I'll get that money, and if any of it's missing, I'll replace it with her fine, soft flesh."" Yikes! But Marion is in for a change of plan. You see, she's pulled off onto a back road and ended up at the Bates Motel, where she meets its proprietor, Norman, and (sort of) his Mother . . . .What can I say? Simply one of the most genuinely scary films ever made and perhaps Hitchock's masterpiece. The shower scene is a classic example of ""what you don't see is scarier than what you do"". And Bernard Hermann's music? Please. The man was brilliant.Perhaps what chilled me the most, though, is the final shot. The look on the great Anthony Perkins' face is absolute genius. And, as another reviewer pointed out, if you look carefully, you'll see Mother's skull superimposed over her son's face before the final shot of Marion's car being pulled from the swamp.With all due respect to the equally great Sir Anthony Hopkins and his brilliant performance as Hannibal Lecter, Norman Bates should have been named the greatest villain of all time.A final note - AVOID the remake. Nothing is on par with the original movie and the director added a couple of unnecessary and gratuitous touches (in the motel scene, Sam is completely nude, and in the ""peeping"" scene, Norman masturbates as he secretly watches Marion get undressed before taking her fateful shower - did we need to see THAT to understand that Marion had become the object of his repressed desire?

He hides Marion and her belongings, including the forty thousand dollars which she had hidden inside a rolled up newspaper, in the boot of her car and drives the car into a nearby swamp.Marion's disappearance prompts her sister, Lila, to start a police investigation.

532,rsabnis1,Thrilling & Riveting; Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho creates an impact greater than most of his epic noirs.,9,18 February 2014,"The way films shot in black-and-white portrays itself to the audience and materialize into something more than just a critical acclaimed film is surely alluring to experience. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho might not be my first movie I watched from the 60's era but it's definitely the one creating a greater impact than the other. The movie has pure visceral feel and induces a thrill so powerful that you might find yourself quite intrigued by it. Psycho opens up with a scene with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) in a rented room of cheap hotel in Pheonix. Their apparent actions and conversations give vivid impression that both are currently having an intense love affair and want to get married soon but are unable to do so since they can't afford the expenses involved. Marion is working in an estate agent's office and meets with a client who gives her 40,000 dollars to buy a house for his daughter.A desperate Marion steals 40,000 dollars from the client and flees from the town. Marion, on the run takes refuge in a motel called as Bates Motel, whose business appeared to be in total shambles. Even being strongly confronted by his dominant mother, the owner of the motel Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) warmly welcomes Marion with warm dinner and cosy room to spend the night in. Things turned horribly ugly when Marion gets murdered in the room of the motel by an unknown entity as she gets stabbed multiple times. The unknown entity in the movie will somewhat be perceived by the audience as 'Psycho' and the overall objective of cold-blooded murder however remains a mystery. Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, Psycho is a mystery thriller with the suspense not being kept on hold for long and becomes quite flagrant. Alfred Hitchcock has made an audacious effort to make such a thriller in which the title of being the 'protagonist' vacillates from one person to another quite impressively. You may not be sure who the lead character actually is but you are pretty sure that the film is not a bizarre scramble of sheer ambiguity. A cinephile's experience will spring to life if he doesn't have the prescience of the suspense before. The film is capricious but still thrilling and fantastically riveting. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is worth the encomium and claps. 9 on 10 stars",Psycho
533,stephparsons,Classic Hitchcock Horror,8,12 May 2013,"A brilliant film and a classic that has most definitely stood the test of time. It was enjoyable watching a black and white movie and then suddenly realizing you didn't notice anyway. Even the actor's clothes didn't seem particularly dated - apart from those bras of Lila Crane (Vera Mills) - but hell, Madonna was wearing those things only a few years ago. What I love about Psycho (and a lot of the older thrillers/slashers) is that it manages to invoke fear and intrepidation without gallons of blood spurting around the room, bones being sawed with grizzly sound effects, close ups of heads exploding etc. Having said this, Psycho did set a new bar for 'violence' and 'sexuality' in movies (apparently Hitchcock had quite a time persuading the studio to let him make the movie). The music is such an integral part of this movie and hits just the right tones denoting 'something really scary is about to happen' or 'it's OK,no one's about to be hacked to death but don't let your guard down'. I did 'jump' on a couple of occasions and that's kudos to Hitchcock's brilliant mastery of suspense. Vera Mills was extremely good but I found her 'guilty' acting a little overblown. What can I say about Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates? Nothing really, he was fantastic. He portrayed the many sides of his troubled character perfectly and was extremely convincing as an 'innocent, sensitive, naïve Mummy's boy'. Other elements that make Psycho so revolutionary and 'deep' include the exploration of family 'bonds', the results of introducing a new family dynamic, and the idea of 'split personality disorder'. If you haven't watched Psycho in a couple of years, I urge you to rent it again and re-visit what I can only describe as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces.",Psycho

The Victorian house, the b&w, all of Hitch's convoluted personality conflicts and dualities all rolled into his most direct masterpiece, plus Bernard Hermann, so good for so long, has never been as effective as he was here.  Many other good films to be sure, such as Vertigo, N/NW, Strangers on a Train, Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt, The Man Who Knew Too Much (34), 39 Steps, Frenzy, but this one has the most impact for me.  Vertigo is a close second, very close.",Psycho
536,b_havag,"Great movie, greater soundtrack",9,16 January 2009,"""Psycho"" is a movie nearly everyone has heard of, either through the movie itself, or through the countless references to it in the media. And so it should be; it is undeniable one of the best horror-experiences in cinema ever as well as a timeless cultural icon.The story about Marion Crane, how she has to run away having stolen 40.000 dollars, leads her to an old motel out of the main road. The owners name is Norman Bates... From here there isn't long until the famous shower-scene, and that's even just the beginning of the movie.What makes this movie so great is the tension, the uneasy feeling that something isn't right, present throughout the whole feature. The key-factor in this tension is the soundtrack, one of the greatest ever. One would have to be a psycho like Bates himself to not feel uneasy when listening to ""Murder"" by Bernard HermannWhen I saw the whole movie for the first time last night, I actually knew the story first. Still, because of the immense power of ""Psycho"" i had trouble getting to sleep. I saw Norma Bates in every corner of my room. This just proves that it is an outstanding feature and the greatest horror flick I have seen. 9/10",Psycho
537,theblackscythe,Rightfully considered one of the all time horror masterpieces.,10,1 October 2014,"(Halloween Horror Reviews #1)To Begin my rush of October horror reviews, I will now cover one of the most iconic and acclaimed horror films ever. Alfred Hitchcock's often imitated, but never matched, Psycho.To start, the film has possibly one of the tightest screenplays ever written. Innumerable twists, plays on the audiences expectations and elegant little subversions upon itself make the plot come alive and dazzle like a firecracker. I mean it when I say that 54 years after its release the rest of the genre is still trying to catch-up Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch's masterpiece of a screenplay. However, the way Hitchcock delivers this script is also incredible. Small visual hints and tricks make the film a joy to re-watch. For example, we see a woman in white underwear, later in the film she wears black underwear to show that she has committed an impure act. Such tiny details, but the impact is massive on the whole.Next the acting. Anthony Perkins delivers one of the most effective 'creepy' performances of all time. Like the screenplay it too has not been matched in 54 years and remains the yardstick for all psychopathic portrayals in film. Aside from Perkins however, the rest of the cast give strong performances, particularly Janet Leigh in the 'starring' role. The set design is legendary. Such mundane and simple locations are brought to life by the films exquisite lighting and use of shadows. The house in the background to the main set looms like a falcon, and casts a shadow over all the preceding events. You feel like someone is watching you at all times, and are constantly on edge. Such simple images as a stuffed bird, or a tall staircase are used so effectively here. This film remains an icon on minimalist set design, and how to creep your audience out with the simplest of imagery. Overall I cannot praise this film enough. One of the most iconic and brilliant films, from one of the most iconic and brilliant directors of all time. Happy Halloween.",Psycho
538,Scream-11,Look at the movie as a whole,2,13 December 1998,"Okay, I'll agree that the shower scene is one of the scariest in movie history.  Hitchcock did an amazing job with that.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't measure up.  The scary start whimpers away into a movie of confusion that can only be described as creepy at best, dull at worst. It's a classic, but that doesn't mean it's good.",Psycho
539,Access Sanctuary,"I'd Kill That Fly If I Were You (No Spoiler, the Killer is Revealed Early in the Film)",6,8 September 2001,"The plot is simple, Marion Crane steals a large sum of money from a client for the bank she works at. She fleas from her unsatisfying job with a cop on her tail, trades in her car, and ends up at the wrong place at the wrong time. The Bates Motel, where 12 cabins are 12 vacancies, owner and operator of the motel (the infamous character Norman Bates) dresses up like his dead mother and slices Marion up in the shower. The whole situation gets quite messy as Norman is investigated by a private detective and suspected of killing Marion for the large sum of money he didn't know she had.
Okay, sure this movie is a huge critical and box-office success. Sure, it's compared to every single other movie in the slasher genre. Sure, it's even responsible for creating the sub-genre as a whole. But, in my opinion, this movie is too long and actually boring as it slowly draws toward it's conclusion. And when you think about it, performance-wise Anthony Perkins is incredible but the rest of the cast is only satisfactory. What does this movie have that really makes it different from other thrillers of the time?",Psycho
540,johncusacksback,Horror masterpiece.,10,3 July 2003,"**** out of ****Psycho is arguably one of the greatest movies of all time, but it without a doubt, rules its genre with an iron fist. The direction and cinematography are of the highest order. They create a dark, gritty, and claustrophobic atmosphere. This adds to the suspense, which is constantly building in every scene and never allows the viewer to look away for a moment. Also, the creepy sets make a perfect backdrop for the horror that is occurring on screen. Still, a movie cannot be complete without good performances and this movie has many of them, but it also has one great performance. Anthony Perkins is perfectly cast as Norman Bates. He is highly disturbing and obviously out of his mind, but we can't help being drawn in by his boyish charm and rooting for him through much of the movie. Which, is a perfect example of classic Hitchcock. He can manipulate you and can make you feel or believe anything he wants you to.",Psycho
541,PeterWilliamson,"Intense, thrilling, a masterpiece!",10,9 September 2007,"One of my favourite films of all time. The intensity of the film is immense, and probably the most suspenseful movies of all time. Hitchcock should of been awarded with a medallion for this one. Definitely his best movie of all time.Anthony Perkins plays the all time famous Norman Bates, the owner of the infamous Bates motel. A well mannered, young man who looks after his mother in his house next door.Janet Leigh is the young, attractive, worried sibling looking for her sister after her surprising disappearance.John Gavin is the polite and curious boyfriend of the young woman whose gone missing, he wants to do everything in his power to help track down his girlfriend.Martin Balsam plays the detective hired by the sister and the boyfriend, a lot is clear to him, but he's still trying to work things out. He's slowly getting closer to the truth.John McIntire is Sheriff Al Chambers, he knows a lot about his town and the people in his town. Him and his wife have been their for a while, a big source of information for the others.All together this is the best horror movie I've seen, and one of the best over all movies. Perfect.",Psycho
542,NBates1,Easily the best,10,4 May 2014,"This film belongs with those movies that are set aside from others; those that will never be forgotten. Its impact is overwhelming and its immortality is inevitable. It is simply Hitchcock's best, as it is different from his previous films (which were all excellent) in suspense. It is more quiet, more gritty and is set in a remote area in the US. This horror film has meaning and underneath the gore and horror there is something deep and poetic; unlike today's films that are filled with blood, gore and not much more. The idea itself sends chills down your spine.The performances are fabulous. A crime was committed in not awarding the Best Actor Oscar to Anthony Perkins, who gave a breathtaking and blood-curdling performance that grew to become iconic. Janet Leigh was magnificent as well. Hitchcock's incomparable directing and story-telling abilities made this film what it is , and the technical effects also help build up the suspense. Who can forget the infamous shower scene and its impact on film-making and suspense movies, where (in my opinion), the finest editing was ever performed in film. I actually believed that the knife was penetrating Marion's body.The famous score by Bernard Herrmann tripled the movie's impact and was absolutely phenomenal, from the quiet suspenseful opening shot to the romantic theme, to the stolen money and the running away, and finally to the motel, where a quiet and creepy theme takes over, and then, of course, the shrieking violins of the murder sequences of the big reveal at the end. All of these factors helped in making PSYCHO one of the greatest movies ever made.10/10",Psycho
543,DarkCity,"Good, but not really Classic",8,14 June 1999,"I'm not sure what to think about this movie.  I'm sure in 1960 it was amazing and the most overwhelming experience movie viewers ever had.  Now, it's too outdated to be suspenseful or scary.  How can this be called a perfect movie?  The acting isn't that good, first of all, and the performances feel forced.  The conversation between Norman and Marion wasn't really chilling, but hard to sit through. I have to admit I like the ""mother twist"".  Renting this movie about 8 months ago, I liked it better the night I watched it but have since changed my mind.  I didn't know that ""mother"" was phony and was shocked at the surprise at the end, even though I knew Norman was the killer.Is this supposed to be evidence of Hitchcock's ""genius""?  The ""let's find Marion"" subplot is really dumb, and there actually is no official plot. He just made it to try and scare people.  And what's with all the furor over the shower scene???  Now that isn't suspenseful at all. You probably think I'm someone who doesn't appreciate classics, but this is about the only one that doesn't cut it for me.  The true mark of a classic is the ability to have the same effect a long time in the future.  Citizen Kane does, this doesn't.  A good film to watch, but nothing like people make it out to be.",Psycho
544,Leopold2,This has to be the best horror movie of all time,10,15 December 2007,"Let me just say that this is not only in my top 10, it is in my top 3. This is the perfect definition of a masterpiece. It was thrilling and suspenseful and everything is flawless. The shower scene has to be one of the scariest and best made scenes of all time. But the scariest scene of the movie is when Norman's mother's rotten corpse in the fruit cellar. The way the corpse is made just makes it so scary.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 from her employer's client and on the run, she stops at a motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins.) Under Norman's mother's domination, he murders her.Anthony Perkins's performance is brilliant as Norman Bates and just about every other actor was perfect in their role and the twist at the end is amazing. I can't see how anyone could possibly not like this movie because to me this is one of the best movies ever. I gave it a perfect 5/5. Alfred Hitchcock is truly a director of masterpieces.",Psycho
545,FilmWiz,The Best Horror Film? No. The best suspense film? Absolutely!,10,23 January 2003,"Yes, this is the greatest suspense film of all time. Yes, back in 1960 it was probably scary, but if the film is watched in modern times, the film is not too scary as it is suspenseful. The story is exactly like Robert Bloch's novel, which was excellent, and I have now read it several times. It always makes me jump, no matter how many times I see it, and I've seen it many times now.Includes the famous ""shower scene""  which has never been duplicated since its filming in 1960",Psycho
546,mrgray83,Hitchcock has yet to disappoint me.,10,19 February 2005,"I consider myself relatively new to Hitchcock's films. Before Psycho, it was The Birds and Vertigo. Vertigo got me hooked, so I decided to give the 1960 Psycho a day in court after seeing the 1998 remake. I now see why a remake was such an infamous move, at least remaking it word for word and scene for scene. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho stands rightfully so as one of the greatest horror/psychological flicks of all time. Alfred Hitchcock's direction as always is on point and the acting is wonderful, especially the Norman Bates character. A truly deranged individual. If you pay enough attention, you can piece together the ending before it actually happens, but even then it's still shocking based on Hitchcock's amazing shooting style. I give this a 10/10. A definite classic in my book.",Psycho
547,lowefreddy,This film earns every word of its praise!,10,20 March 2021,"Some all-time famous cult classics don't live up to expectations. You watch them and think, ""...just a tiny bit overrated"", shrugging off the disappointment. Psycho is not one of those films. This film has rightly earned every single positive review, critical acclaim, new generation of fans, all of it - not to mention having aged like fine wine. As this site's other reviews so aptly point out, if you haven't seen it yet, for heaven's sake stop reading the reviews and get on it!Anthony Perkins is outstanding. The plot is outstanding. The atmosphere and cinematography are outstanding. The music is a particularly outstanding standout. Hitchcock tends to pull off winners anyway (please see Rope, Dial M For Murder, and The Birds) but this is a particularly marvellous one. It's worth watching just for that final scene alone! Good luck trying to forget that.",Psycho
548,Movieman-133,"Psycho, The most overrated horror.. NO suspense movie of all time.",1,16 July 1999,"Well,   what can I say about this film.   It's merely okay and the black and white makes the film seem completely dull and frankly quite boring.  I don't understand what all this talk about the color being artistic but I found it repulsive.   The acting in the movie was very mediocre, especially from the stiff John Gavin,   the ever so proper Vera Miles,  and the so serious Martin Balsam.   Try watching the new Psycho and you'll find that these characters can actually have personalities. As for Janet Leigh, well she was good,   but Anne Heche seemed more innocent,  more human,  and more sympathetic.   As for Anthony Perkins,    he's also so monotone, barely ANY emotion,   and I struggle to understand why people rave over his dry performance.  As for the ""mother twist"",  well that was good but there are twists in about every horror film now a days and they are usually more entertaining than this joke. And then there is the shower scene which everyone says is so scary?  Where have they been ,  I could pick out a dream sequence from any A Nightmare on Elm Street sequel that was done more creatively and powerfully.  It was a simple knifing in the shower for god's sake,   isn't watching the opening of Drew Barrymore in Scream ten times more chilling and exciting? Give me a break,  when I went to Universal Studious they said the shower sequence was one of the most famous scenes of all time.  Well,  give an audience an opportunity to watch either that or the astonishing death of Piper Laurie in Depalma's Carrie,  or the thrill of the finale chase in Halloween,  and well see what brings more reactionary emotion of the audience.  Well,  what can I say about a movie that I will never understand?  When people made the new Psycho some thought it was stupid because of the story--and so I know I'm not alone.   It's just that these old foggies are so hung up on old movies that they are blind to see that modern movies provide for much more entertainment.    Some old horror films like Rosemary's Baby are excellent,  but this is not.  As for Bernard Herrmann score,   it's overplayed,   can't he think of anything new to compose? Compare Pino Donnagio' lush score from Carrie opposed to this and see what's more creative and effective.  What can I say besides people, this movie is simply average and that it might of have been good back then, but it's simply OK now.  Do we still rave about the type writer just because it was original back then?  I have spoken and I guess that Blockbuster Video agrees with me that the movie is too much of a joke to be placed in the horror section.  It's in the Drama suspense category,  and certainly a thrilless and dated film to belong anywhere else.  Psycho remains as the most overrated film of all time and the new Psycho is a much better improvement.",Psycho
549,jaspervanzyl,The best film of all time!,10,4 March 2001,"When Alfred Hitchcock started to direct this film in 1959, he could have had no idea that a film starring Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh could bypass the brilliance of his films starring James Stewart (Vertigo, The Man Who Knew too Much and Rear Window). But how wrong he was...""Psycho"" went on to become the highest grossing black and white film of all time, (In a time when colour films were already popular) the highest grossing horror film of all time and the highest grossing Alfred Hitchcock film of all time. The film made Anthony Perkins a superstar, but sadly, this was more harming to his career than uplifting, as the movie-going public always have (and always will) only seen him as Norman Bates, and nobody else. This was concurred as Perkins never again made a film of real value, but in 1983 ""Psycho 2"" was a huge hit for Universal Pictures. Janet Leigh on the other hand, went on to make a few well done done films in her respect.
About the film: Anthony Perkins' performance as the stuttering Norman Bates is in my opinion the greatest film performance of all time. His nervous, boyish acting style brings a simple charm to the character, and he even succeeds in creating a sympathetic approach from the public. He even succeeds in hiding his character's madness, and couldn't do it better. Janet Leigh is perfect as the thief, and you even have more sympathy for Norman as for Marion. The rest of the cast, (John Gavin - Sam Loomis; Vera Miles - Lila Crane; Martin Balsam - Milton Arbogast and John McIntire's Sheriff Chambers) are all as good as it gets, but no one matches Anthony Perkins performance. Sorry to say, but John Gavin is miscast. He looks too gentle, too moral to ever cheat on his wife. This is the only bad thing about this cinema classic.The classic shower scene not only created a single shock, but a film memory to haunt for generations to come. Alfred Hitchcock filmed this scene with great care and delicacy. You can sense this with the fact that not a finger is out of place, and even Janet Leigh still showers in fear.I was disgusted when I learned that Perkins wasn't even nominated for an Academy Award, because he should have won it! He wasn't nominated for ANY prize of ANY kind, and to crown it all, Janet Leigh was nominated for an Oscar and won a Golden Globe. Well deserved, I should think, but Perkins was the real reason that the film reached such success, not Leigh, nor Hitchcock.I salute both Anthony Perkins and sir Alfred Hitchcock for what they've done for film history, and for the fact that there will be only one Tony Perkins, and one Alfred Hitchcock.",Psycho

552,RohitRajkumar,One of the best films to come out of Hollywood,10,15 January 2009,"First of all,a black and white movie is always difficult to keep the modern generation audience glued to their seats so Psycho is an exception.The script has been very cleverly written and the editing of the movie is top-notch .The performances are mind-blowing especially by Anthony Perkins.The actor so effortlessly carries off the role with innocence and confidence that he makes you stand and take notice of him.The gripping suspense intensifies with each successive frame and the shocking climax would make you stand and applaud the masterpiece.Alfred Hitchcock - The Master adds another feather to his cap after ""Vertigo"" and delivers another blockbuster with ""The Birds"".If you liked Psycho,you would definitely like the other two movies and know what an era of quality cinema ,""The Master"" has created.",Psycho
553,returning,Oedipus Unbound,8,17 June 2004,"Part of a film's aging process is how it deals with the fact that after 40 years of spin offs and SNL skits, everyone already knows not only how the film ends but the key events as well. ""Casablanca"" is perhaps the greatest example of this. So what happens when a film becomes a modern fable with every scene recognized and many of the twists expected, especially in a film steeped so heavily in suspense?Hitchcock's suspense is not simply based on the fact that the viewer doesn't know what's going happen, rather he turns those expectations into fears by limiting our scope to that of the camera. We all know THAT the investigator is going to be killed, it's in the trailer, but the exact moment is as much a mystery to us as it is to the victim.I was intrigued as to how much parts of the film resembled an Attic tragedy since there is some great foreshadowing (Bates's hesitance to show her the bathroom) and characters who bring something to the table, but who are ultimately lacking. Bates's own downfall would need to be explored more deeply (the psychiatrist's speech doesn't cut it) to really merit such a label, which the now infamously terrible remakes attempted to explore.What I find most fascinating is the shift, it's as if half the film is devoted to the aftermath and is exceeding the suspense structure that Hitchcock had created. It was daring and worked perfectly. It may seem not that the film was based too much on it's ability to frighten, but there are enough Freudian (albeit, relatively transparent) references as well as some clever arrangements of the camera and the props to keep today's sanest at the most, fascinated, and at the least, entertained.4 out of 5 - An excellent film.",Psycho
554,Kane20,Review - Psycho (1960),9,1 July 2012,"Psycho is a good, memorable film. I don't love it, but I do like it; it's a good piece of cinema and is notable for many things. First of all, the black-and-white cinematography is good, and it really contributes to the tone and mood of the film. There are several great camera shots and sequences. The music is good too, and it also contributes to the tone of the film, probably even more so than the cinematography. Finally, and probably most importantly, the film is noteworthy for its storytelling. Alfred Hitchcock broke several Hollywood cinema traditions of the time, and created a film that contains elements that can be easily recycled, yet at the same time is very unique, and is a good mystery horror thriller.The story isn't all that great, but what makes it good and involving is the way it develops and unfolds. There are a lot of aspects of the movie that are not so special, and ones that have been used again and again over the years. There are some things about the movie that seem cliché, and possibly a bit cheesy. However, despite all this, after all these years, Psycho still has a uniqueness that is memorable and ultimately not copied to this day. Like I said, it's not the most extraordinary story, but it's structured in a great way. It tampers with some traditional narrative elements. It starts out seemingly normal in terms of narrative. Then, we are shocked at the movie's midpoint as Marion, our protagonist for the first half of the movie, is killed, and the course of the film is drastically changed, and what follows is a series of (like I said before) shocking discoveries and twists. The audience's expectations keep being flouted, especially in the second half of the film, especially in two major ones, the second of which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the film. It doesn't have great story or character complexity, but yes, it's strong.The stark black-and-white cinematography used in the film is very good, and even further contributes the the tone of the film. Also, by far one of the most important aspects of the film is the music. Bernard Herrmann composed an excellent score for the film. The film works fine with its narrative alone, but the music really brings it all to life and supports everything. The music consisted of all string instruments, and the music is consistently dissonant and tense. The music, like everything else about the film, can be easily recycled in movies, but, like I said before, Psycho still has a level of uniqueness that really can't be matched.Overall, it's an important landmark in the history of cinema, and it's still a good film, even to this day - not at a four-star level, but still very good. I found it to be a very good movie experience. If you haven't seen it, I recommend you do.",Psycho
555,dylanwhaley,Nah its still the best.,10,24 May 2021,The birth of all psychological thrillers. Perfect performances from Perkins and Leigh. The musical score is classic and chilling. And Hitchcock has the perfect eye as always. It laid the groundwork for so many of my favorites.,Psycho
556,plsj,Classic Horror Film,10,16 July 2002,"I'm can't say that this is Hitchcock's best film because I have yet to see his other classics (Rear Window, Vertigo, North By Northwest).

Plus an standout performance by Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. 10/10",Psycho
557,jackhamel1987,The original low budget slasher film.,10,30 August 2011,"It's 1960. Alfred Hitchcock had just seen huge success with North by Northwest, and he was considered a master of slow burning, suspense cinema. He could have had any budget he wanted, any cast he wanted - in fact he could have done anything he wanted.So what did he do? He took a cheap TV crew, a virtually unknown cast and a script that a lot of people weren't keen on and he filmed it. He was the only one sure that it would work - so sure that he traded his standard paycheck for 60% of the net profits (earning him the equivalent of $150 million in today's money).The result...? The original slasher film that instantly changed the concept of horrors, thrillers and villains. This might not be as complex as Vertigo, or as relevant as Rear Window, but this is the film that changed cinema and paved the way for the likes of The Exorcist, Scream and most other slashers, horrors and thrillers. Hitchcock created a piece of cinema history with this film, and you would be hard pressed to find any film maker since who hasn't at some point used Psycho for reference.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a lost woman. She wants to get away from everything - her job, her home, her boyfriend, her life. Her chance comes one afternoon when a rich tycoon leaves $40,000 in cash as a deposit for a house. Instead of taking the money to the bank, Marion steals it and goes on the run. After two days, she finds herself a little lost, but near a motel - The Bates Motel. She meets Norman Bates, a shy man who is looking after his invalid mother. She and Norman have a conversation, where she decides that she should go back home and face up to what she has done. However, that night, she is violently murdered by someone, and this coincides with an investigation into her disappearance - an investigation that leads to the best of Hitchcocks's climaxes.What makes this film so good? Well, Hitchcock said it best himself ""It wasn't a message that stirred the audiences, nor was it a great performance...they were aroused by pure film."" This film exists only to terrify us, entertain us, move us, thrill us. There is no message, there is no moral lecture. This film is about one director's vision to take an audience on a roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills. And this film does that to perfection. Nearly all of Hitchcock's most memorable action is in this film (the infamous shower scene is just one), and they are handled so incredibly well that even now they can't cease to entertain. The direction is the winner here. The carefully planned shots, the black and white images, the lighting, the shadows - nothing here has been left to chance and everything has been thought out so, so well. Stanley Kubrick is often accredited with the 'Kubrick stare'. Yet it might well be that he took that idea from Hitchcock, who's final shot of Norman Bates is one of the most chilling and unforgettable shots in film.Of course, whilst this film is brilliant almost exclusively because of Hitchcock's expert direction, we can't forget the cast. Janet Leigh was immortalised in her role as the ill-fated Marion Crane and she does a wonderful job as the woman who is essentially lost in her own life. Martin Balsam adds a touch of class with his portrayal of Arbogast, the private detective. And Vera Miles is strong and effective as Marion's worried sister.But, this acting in this film is virtually owned by Anthony Perkins as the truly chilling Norman Bates, who is arguably the best villain in film. Every second that he is on screen, you know there is something wrong, you know that this sweet, innocent, shy man is hiding a terrible secret. You're afraid to know what it is, but Perkins uses the screen to tease, to make you want to know more about him even though you know it's horrific. Perkins was so good in the role that it actually typecast him and hindered the rest of his career.Between Hitchcock's direction and Perkins acting, there is enough horror to last a lifetime. But added to the strong cast, the wonderful plot and the exceptional soundtrack by Bernard Herrman, and what we have here is something that is truly original, truly groundbreaking and remains a huge milestone in cinema.This is pure cinema at its best. No lectures, no messages. Just action.",Psycho

Her boss spots her, the looming policeman, the suspicious car salesman but all this just a sub-plot. The real plot starts when she arrives at the motel. For people who saw this film the first time must have got a real shock to see a star such as Janet Leigh killed off halfway into the film.

562,claptonisgod53,"""We All Go A Little Mad Sometimes...""",10,29 June 2008,"Psycho takes a lot of credit for starting the modern horror genre. Well, I must say that it deserves it. Before Psycho, censorship was extremely strict. Psycho broke a lot of rules in its day... not only did it go above and beyond with its famous murder sequences, but it also went above and beyond with smaller censorship rules. Psycho was the first American film where the audience could clearly see a flushing toilet in full frame. Psycho was also the first film to show a women walking around in her under-garments for an extended period of time. If Psycho had not come around, it could very well be possible that the idea of Jason stabbing a teenage couple having sex would have been frowned upon by the censorship boards. Psycho changed the way movies where made, which is what opened up the idea of the slasher film, and the horror genre in general.There had been horror films before Psycho, but none broke all of the rules that Psycho had. All the rules that Psycho broke became rules that everyone broke. For this reason, there have been too many Psycho rip-offs to count. Scream, Friday the 13th, Saw, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, and even Black Christmas are all pure rip-offs of Psycho's success. This could very well be Psycho's only con, and it isn't even the film's fault. Now don't get me wrong, Halloween and Friday the 13th are good films, but if you are at all interested in horror/suspense, you have to view the movie that set new standards for the genre when it was released in 1960. Today, in 2008, Psycho doesn't seem nearly as well done as it was when it was released. However, it is just as good as it used to be. The only reason it doesn't seem good is because of one thing... publicity. AFI, Youtube, Google... It's all the same. Surly everyone alive today has seen the shower scene somewhere, whether or not they have seen the movie. I had personally seen certain scenes before viewing the film itself, so a large amount of the impact was lost for me. Psycho still left a chill on my back, and worked very well. If you are one of the lucky few who haven't seen clips of Psyhco, I highly encourage that you do not search for any. Search out the movie itself. As for the film itself, it is purely remarkable. The cast is extremely remarkable. Anthony Perkins is extremely amazing in his role as Norman Bates. Perkin's performance isn't only Oscar-Worthy, it is also one of the greatest performances of all time. It is up there with Anthony Hopkins' role as Hannibal Lector in my book. Janet Leight and Vera Miles are also very good actresses, and fit the role of heroine in Psycho very well. The acting in Psycho doesn't seem dated at all.The suspense is also spectacular in Psycho. Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant directing and Bennard Herrman's chilling score work together to build up atmosphere and suspense for the film. This is done extremely well. Psycho may very well be one of the most suspenseful movies of all time. Another thing that helps with the amount of atmopshere of the movie is how real it looks and feels. Everything in this movie seems realistic to the viewer. You can relate to the people in the film, especially with the way the characters are developed.Psycho may very well be the flawless movie. It has everything to not only make it a great horror film, but a great film as well. Any horror fan should check out Psycho, simply because it set so many new levels in the genre. Any film fan in general should check out Psycho is well, simply because it is so well made. Psycho is a must view for everyone. A lot of the movies from the 50s and 60s seem very cheesy by today's standards of computer animation and slang talk. However, Psycho still fits in with the classics. This is because Alfred Hitchcock directed his movies for the audience, not for the critics. This is obviously why the critics responded terribly to it. There were very few positive reviews for Psycho by all of the huge film critics, yet it still ranks as the 21st greatest film ever made on the IMDb top list. Hitchcock was able to not only make this movie well, but he was also able to make it enjoyable.Psycho still ranks in with the HORROR classics as well. Perhaps this is due the way it inspired so many films to come after it. This may also be due the fact that Psycho plays with all of the fears that thrilled audiences just as much today as it did in 1960; The thrill of running from the police; The fear of run-down motels; The fear of strangers; The feel of taking showers alone; and of course: The fear of our mother's rage.For more horror film reviews, check out my channel on youtube: horrorreviews123",Psycho
563,ecarle,Simply the Best,10,19 July 2003,"It is not really necessary for ""Psycho"" to frighten viewers anymore. In 1960, it was the most terrifying film ever made, and had full houses screaming their lungs out at theaters all over the world.  It was the first ""slasher movie"" and so much more.  Everything in American movies changed after ""Psycho"":  sex, violence, the star system.  It was revolutionary.  And ""Psycho"" ruled the 60's as the shocker of the decade.  CBS had to cancel the TV debut in 1966 because it was too controversial.  When local channels started showing it in 1967, it terrified millions more in the privacy of their own homes.40 years-plus later, maybe ""Psycho"" will scare you, maybe it won't. But what it WILL still do is prove itself a masterpiece of filmmaking.  Hitchcock and his collaborators were at top form. Look at the editing, the composition of shots, the camera movements.  Look at the unforgettable performance of Anthony Perkins as nervous young motel manager Norman Bates.  Look at the unforgettable performance of Janet Leigh as motel guest Marion Crane.  Look at all the great performances in support, from the millionaire at the beginning to the psychiatrist at the end.  (The great overlooked performance is that of Martin Balsam as Arbogast, one smart, funny, and tenacious private detective.)And LISTEN to Bernard Herrmann's classic score -- the greatest score ever written for a thriller.   The ""screeching violins"" are the most famous motif in shocker history (only the ""Jaws"" shark theme comes close),and the ""three notes of madness"" at the very end of the film were so great that Martin Scorcese put them into ""Taxi Driver"" and George Lucas put them into ""Star Wars.""""Psycho"" scared millions in 1960.  It made history, and it really doesn't matter if it scares you the same way today.  But try watching it alone one night, after midnight, with the sound turned up high to catch Herrmann's music.  It's still pretty scary if you let it be.",Psycho

568,laika-lives,Janet Leigh - Hiding In Plain Sight,10,14 May 2006,"There's very little to be said about this most analysed and rewatched of films that hasn't been said multiple times before, but I'd like to draw attention to a great performance that, I think, has been unjustly and perversely neglected. Whilst most commentators (rightly) praise Anthony Perkins for his astonishingly nuanced performance, many overlook the subtler, more measured work done by Janet Leigh.At first, it seems paradoxical that Leigh could be overlooked in what is certainly her most famous role (one of the most famous roles in American cinema, in truth), but it is that very fame that causes people to overlook the actual quality of the work she is doing. After all, the part of Marion Crane is seen almost entirely in relation to the plot's structure - the heroine who is killed half way through the film, and leaves us and the camera somewhat stranded in the Bates Motel, where we begin to follow the story of Norman Bates. It doesn't help that her death scene is probably the most iconic film sequence yet recorded (the Odessa Steps sequence in 'Battleship Potempkin' doesn't have the pop culture cache, trust me). Who notices the actress when Hitchcock's structural and technical experimentation come together with such incendiary force? And yet Leigh is extraordinary, giving what might be the performance of her career. She'd proved herself a winning comedienne and musical star in the fifties, but often seemed to be left on the sidelines - as in the enjoyable 'Scaramouche' and the turgid, tacky 'Black Shield of Falworth' (which nevertheless shows her at her most beautiful - the improbably gorgeous black gown she wears in one scene is the epitome of 'devastating'). Of the three dark thrillers she made in the late fifties and early sixties, she would be excellent in what amounts to three scenes in 'The Manchurian Candidate', and had been perfectly cast but arguably peripheral to the story in 'Touch of Evil'. In 'Psycho', she disappears after forty minutes, but for once gets to hold the screen absolutely in the time she does have.It's a precise performance that shows no strain. She's controlled, immaculate, yet also believably sexual. Mores were changing, and 'Psycho' was at the forefront. There's something oddly shocking about seeing Leigh in her underwear (it would have been taboo under the Hayes code only a short while before), let alone in the shower, but Leigh betrays no discomfort. It's all done so casually, it barely seems as though anything new is being done.What's striking about 'Psycho' on repeat viewings is how melancholy it is. It may be the saddest film the Master ever made ('Vertigo' is bleak in a different way; it has the structure of Tragedy. 'The Wrong Man', meanwhile, has a forced happy ending). A large part of this is down to Leigh, who has to make us care about this woman in a short space of time. She succeeds, but she also succeeds in drawing out the kinkiness and oddness of Marion - the smile she gives when she imagines what is being said about her, for instance, before it gives way to worry and even fear (I've always thought that Leigh was rather wasted as good girls and would have made a great femme fatale - those big eyes and heart-shaped face are perfect - and as Marion she plays on a lot of the qualities that would have made her ideal).A small word here for Vera Miles here, too. Her role is more restricted, but her brittle, guarded performance is another overlooked gem, probably because she isn't warm or sympathetic. Her character is flinty and highly competent, Marion's more respectable counterpart. Their performances resonate with each other astoundingly well given that they don't share any screen time - they really are believable sisters, despite not looking that much alike. Lila Crane is, in many ways, Hitchcock's most straightforward, unkinky heroine. She's also one of his most uncompromising, not brooking argument from Sam Loomis or the Sheriff. Only Arboghast ruffles her. She penetrates to the heart of the mystery with ruthless efficiency. And in a film well known for its ironic one liners, my favourite is Lila's 'I can handle a sick old woman', which works differently depending on whether you know the secret of the film or not (she can't handle that sick old woman - but actually, it isn't a sick old woman at all).",Psycho
569,Hitch-26,The First Modern Horror Classic,10,9 September 2000,"Revolutionary in its time, Hitchcock's Psycho still shocks today when viewed.  It is the standard that every horror movie is judged by.  Filmed in black and white, everything in this movie--the music, the dialogue, the scenery, etc. is perfectly in sync and is a big reason this movie is a classic.  One bad thing is that I read somewhere that one of the goofs in the movie is when Janet Leigh is killed in the bathroom and staring at the camera, you can see her adam's apple moving.  I had never noticed that, but after reading that I noticed it the next time I watched it and it sort of ruined the illusion for me.  Oh well, that was about the only thing wrong with this movie.  Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam are all outstanding.

Don't get me wrong-  I love this movie but there are others equally deserving of attention. Anthony Perkins is outstanding as good old Norman Bates- the stuttering (also used in 1948's Rope) is an outstanding touch. The shower scene is not extremely violent but none-the-less very effective especially for that time period. In fact, one of the things I love about all Hitchcock movies is he knew what to show and what not to show (not like in today's show everything society).

571,b-gallagher2,Movie review,10,4 April 2011,"One of the most influential and innovative horror films ever made!! Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho shows us all just how great of a filmmaker he really was. Strictly one of his best. This movie goes beyond conventional styles of horror films and brings us into the mind of Hitchcock himself. The movie has an exceptional storyline. The movie also does something exceptional that most horror films seem to always lack, CHARACTER RELATIONSHIP! The movie conveys an excellent stylistic form of really working on the characters. Working on them in such a way that we as the audience can actually grow attached to them. So if something happens to a character in Psycho we as the audience actually feel emotion towards these characters and can really relate to it all. This sense of attachment to the characters and our relationships to them is what draws us that much closer to the movie. That's why Psycho is so scary! Most horror movies show us characters in which we don't know so when something scary and bad happens to them, we could care less. In fact we usually just say ""wow, that guy was so stupid for going off alone."" We don't say that in Psycho. This movie actually scares us, we don't feel that the characters are dumb at all. I really found this style so fascinating. Also this movie had one of the most classic horror shower scenes of all time! One other thing I noted when watching this movie was how well Hitchcock developed the core of the entire story. The movie had an excellent core meaning to it and also showed development, progression and movement. Excellent movie. Hitchcock is a legend and so is this movie.",Psycho
572,ChristophCinema,Best Horror Movie of All Time,10,18 December 2012,"I don't have much to say about Psycho because it's already so well known, and I'll probably ruin it for those who haven't seen it; so I'll keep this brief. Psycho is probably the greatest horror movie of all time. It broke new grounds in film violence with its famous shower scene, and launched the slasher genre. No more atomic age, bring on the psychopaths. Now, this movie isn't like The Exorcist or The Shining, where you'll have nightmares over it; but unlike those movies, this movie keeps you on edge constantly. The whole time, there's just this nervous energy, and you never know what to expect. Hitchcock always believed that there's no terror in the bang, just in the anticipation of it. There are these long scenes that just have you biting your nails the whole time. By the end of the movie, you'll be wondering what happened to your fingers. The movie doesn't rely on cheap horror movie gimmicks. It's not gory, it doesn't use jump scares; the horror lies in the dialogue, the performances, the cinematography, the lighting, the music, and the story. This isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but I still believe it's the greatest horror movie of all time. Why? Because it's the classiest the genre has to offer. Today, the horror genre is so dumbed down, and so unoriginal, that it's nice to look back and see that the horror genre can be done well, and respected for something other than blood and nudity. Psycho is one of the greatest, most suspenseful, most controversial films of all time, and I love it. Hitchcock really knows how to bring on the scares.",Psycho
573,graham_525,still great,10,13 July 2010,"I've just watched this again and it still stands up as a truly great piece of cinema. Anthony Perkins is superb as the nervous twitchy Norman Bates. The conversation between him and Janet Leigh is incredibly tense as the dark under currents in Norman's psyche show through. The shower scene is still shocking and Anthony Perkin's reaction when he sees what his ""mother"" has done is great acting. The style of the film is fascinating as well. It has elements of Film Noir but with a 60s art house feel. It was a brave film for Hitchcock to make at that stage in his career and demonstrates what a true master he was of his craft.",Psycho

575,BrianCTyler,Creepy classic slasher film,10,9 March 2006,"PSYCHO (1960)directed by: Alfred Hitchcockstarring: Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, and John Gavinplot: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) runs away from home after stealing $40,000 from her employer so she can marry her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin). One rainy night, she takes refuge in the Bates Motel, run by the kind, young Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who also takes care of his ill mother. This sets off a series of horrific events when Marion, Sam, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and a detective (Martin Balsam) try to discover the secrets of the Bates family.my thoughts: There is really nothing new to say about PSYCHO that hasn't been said already. It's just the perfect thriller. It has a great script, beautiful directing, well developed characters, and much more.The characters are greatly casted. Anthony Perkins definitely portrayed one of the horror genre's best characters in Norman Bates - a kind, handsome young man who has a lot of dark secrets to hide. Janet Leigh is a very classy actress and it works in the role of a woman who has done some pretty bad things but she is still sympathetic enough to care about. Vera Miles, Martin Balsam, and Simon Oakland also do great while John Gavin is a bit wooden. Not as bad as people say but still wooden.The setting is also great. A simple, deserted motel with a large, dark, and creepy mansion just over the hill from it. The Bates Motel is a lot like the character of Norman himself. Seems simple and looks nice, but has terrible secrets behind it. The motel and mansion are just like characters in the film.The music is very suspenseful. I don't think any horror score can match this other than CARRIE. The sound effects that come with the knife make the death scenes much more effective, as the same sound did 16 years later when Carrie used her powers.Alfred Hitchcock is a great director. The shower scene, the staircase scene, and the finale in the cellar alone are reasons to see this film.

In the beginning of the movie we see a long take of showing the city and then the camera focuses on a building and then goes right to the window and into the room. Lila Crane who is played by Vera Miles steals 40,000 thousand dollars from her work and we see her in a car. While she is in the car the camera is facing her and we can see cars in the back. We can also hear her thoughts while she is driving. In this movie the camera like to focus on the objects. Lila arrives at a motel. She meets Norman Bates. Norman plays his character well. He is very psychotic. He has two personalities. But the audience doesn't find that out until the end of the movie. He or should I say his mother ends up killing Lila. We never actually see her get stabbed with the knife just see her struggling and then falling down and see some blood. I like how the camera focuses on the drain in the shower and then we see her eye. The music in this movie lets the audience know that something is gonna happen. So there is a lot of suspense throughout the movie.",Psycho

""Psycho"" truly delivers in every sense of the word.

Janet Leigh screaming while being attacked in the shower is a scene that defines a whole genre, and it's Hitchcock's work that has made that scene, and the whole movie, simply timeless.""Psycho"" is particularly good (and troubling to audiences) because it steps back from the fantastic beasts who stalk towns. Instead of vampires and werewolves, ""Psycho"" has a much more realistic (and thus haunting) beast: one of us. Instead of gore, there is suspense.

Although I felt that the ending was fairly predictable the beginning of the movie definitely had me thinking. I also think that people watching the film back in the sixties appreciate the plot twist and the simpleness of this film. Watching this movie in 2010 the film seems almost jaded but that is because it was one of the better psychological thriller of its time. So the little cliché moments in the movie were at that time probably very scary. For example the shower scene I felt it to be very fake but once again today we see movies such as Saw it is hard to leave anything to the imagination after that. Psycho was a movie that I enjoyed to watch because it had a certain eerie feel throughout the film, and it is one of the only older horror films that have given me chills.",Psycho
581,Alligator_80,Proof that pre-1970's horror existed,10,18 April 2007,"Arguably the most famous horror movie in the history of cinema, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho still stands up well today, despite the numerous parodies of the movie, most notably the shower scene.Though I was unfortunate enough to stumble upon the ending, where one discovers the identity of the killer- Norman Bates donned in women's clothing, Psycho was still very likable.The film's greatest strength for me, was Norman Bates- one of the greatest villains in movie history. Unlike countless horror movies, the villain of Psycho isn't one-dimensional and though a villain he many be, one grows to sympathize with him, and almost like him. A unfortunate childhood and misguided personality, just barely described toward the end, is where the real suspense kicks in. Finishing with a dark glare from Bates, the viewer is left feeling confused and terrified for even after the killer is revealed, why he really murdered who he murdered is left merely half explained.The viewer can grapple for answers all they like, but it is unlikely that they find the true answers to all the questions that float around in their head after the screen has faded to black, which gives Psycho an ingredient that places it above the likes of Halloween, Friday the 13th or even The Shining and is enough proof that Alfred Hitchcock will always be THE master of suspense.",Psycho

584,stealth4933,Wonderful Movie,10,22 July 2008,"Vertigo is defitely Hitchcock's masterpiece from a director's standpoint. It had new and innovative cinematography techniques and a very complex plot line. It was no doubt one of a kind and is still unrivaled by any other thriller because it is impossible to copy it. Psycho is the exact opposite. Psycho was the first true slasher film, but even more, it was the first thriller/horror blockbuster. Sure their had been others before it, The cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Frankenstein for example, but none of them hit home the same way that Psycho did. Psycho is a triumph for the common movie watcher. It is a movie that any one can enjoy because it is deceptively simple. Even more than that, however, it is probably one of, if not the, most influential films ever. Many films have tried, unsuccessfully of course, to imitate its one of a kind plot and execution. Any slasher film about a family going to a secluded place and being stalked by an invisible killer can be traced back to psycho. But even with the endless copies and even one remake, no movie has ever captured the horror of Psycho. The Exorcist was a text book grossout film, Jaws was scary for frequent beach goers, and Alien was a horrific movie about our friends from outer space. All three of these don't approach psycho for one reason and one reason alone: The Shower Scene. It is hard to still get the full efect of the shower scene because there is so little blood. It is nothing compared to some of the brutal murders from movies such as Last House on the Left. It, however, taps a nerve that no one else has, and that is not from too little effort. No, it is great for one reason and one reason alone, it is a SHOWER scene. This is the reason it is so scary. I could not take a shower with the curtain closed for a week after I saw this movie. The reason it is so scary is because most people in America take a shower at least once a day. Sure Jaws is scary, but some people go there whole life time without going to beach. Everyone takes showers. It is also hard for the average person to realize just how vulnerable they are in the shower. This is the reason why this scene is so powerful. It uses an event that happens in many households every day. This is what sets psycho apart and this is why it is so unique. So, in conclusion, My advise to any slasher film fans is to watch Psycho, love Psycho, worship Psycho.",Psycho

I have watched this week both the original 1960 and the 1998 remake for the first time. This movie is overrated. Anthony Perkins did a great job, but the rest of the characters were horribly acted. The story is good, audio line matches harmoniously. But the movie is very slow It could have used some pace. Even Considering it was made in 1960.It isn't as good as its reputation. Psycho surely builds the base of horror movies, but certainly it's not the best one. The remake is slightly better (much better acting especially from Heche compared with Janet Leigh), so if you haven't watch both, i would recommend the latter....",Psycho
588,The_Coffee_Frog,"Saintly is an ambiguous word- ""Psycho"": Why You Should Watch:",10,30 April 2019,"""Psycho""- A review of Hitchcock's slick, insight into an alternative psyche.
""Psycho"" is Hitchcock at his finest, the film was realised in 1960 and was met with staggering adversity. However, as the years passed people recognized it as a masterpiece. The plot centres around a women named Marion (Janet Leigh), who embezzles a large sum of cash, in order to run off with her ""star-crossed lover"". However, midway through her excursion she decides to check into a vacancy for the night at the elusive ""Bates' Motel"", run by the reclusive Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).
One of this films aspects that deserves an abundance of acclaim is its spine-chilling and accurate portrayal of a psychopath. Hitchcock masterfully manipulates the mind of the audience into perceiving things which are not actually shown on screen. Primarily in the notorious ""shower scene"".
Hitch's direction is magnificent and seamless, the characters are well established, the film is littered with cleverly thought out and well placed symbolism and to conclude it all a jaw-dropping/disturbing twist, which will haunt you for the rest of the evening.
In conclusion, those looking for a mindless ""slasher"", then ""Psycho"" is not the film for you! ""Psycho"" may be classified as a ""horror"" but in my mind it will always be a ""psychological thriller"". Simply as must see for any film fanatic- It is also my favourite film. It is unsurprisingly a 10/10.

589,Mulder-51,Alfred Hitchcock's best...,10,18 August 1999,After all these years Alfred Hitchcock decided to make himself the master of horror. Psycho is the film that terrified the generation of '60.But the weird and spectacular thing about Psycho is that it can terrify as well our generation. When I first saw this film I could not have a shower for at least one week! I had the impression that Norman Bates could kill me at any moment. Sir Alfred Hitchcock is the master of horror!,Psycho
590,thisisaj-2,Not all It's Cracked up to be,4,27 October 2000,"I watched Psycho for my Perspectives on Popular Culture, and I was not impressed at all by the shower scene.  The one thing that was really intriguing was the character of Norman Bates, who would make an interesting study in probably any field. I guess what made me dislike Psycho is that I knew the plot ahead of time. I bet that if I saw this film in 1960 I would have enjoyed it a lot more. It reminded me a little of the Sixth Sense, another psychological thriller.L.R.",Psycho
591,mathhater4life,Don't go in the shower!,7,17 November 2001,"What made me love this movie was Norman Bates. He seemed like a such a nice every-day type guy...that just so happens to be psychotic and stab people in their showers. Janet Leigh (who is a much better actress than her daughter) was a great choice for her character. On the other hand, I really hated the whiny girl they cast as her sister. What made psycho work as a thriller/ horror phenonemon was the way it was marketed..because, let's face it--the shower scene isn't THAT scary. The reason why its so memorable is because of the way it shocked people who didn't know what to expect. I mean if you watch the old trailers, it doesn't give away much. So Psycho really should go down in history as a classic.",Psycho
592,stasia_stasia,"No Matter How Old, It's Still a Masterpiece!!",10,29 March 2010,"A great start with the introduction credits cool music and dashing movement. Starts off with a slow long take overlooking the city carefully zooming in on the subject and story line. Over the years I have been told about this movie, how well done it is, how great it is, but I have never seen this film until now. This was such an amazing movie from start to finish, a masterpiece. No matter how old it is, or how many times people have talked about it that one famous shower scene is so suspenseful and scary. Hitchcock is pretty much one of the greatest directors of his time. His use of long takes draws the viewer even deeper into the film. The different angle shots and subtle zoom ins makes even more suspense and horror. (spoiler) Actress Vera Miles who plays Lila Crane did an outstanding job, even though she is in only about half the movie. I was very surprised to see that the main character of the film was murdered in the middle, probably the first or second film I ever saw to have that happen. (End Spoiler)The suspicious man Bates, owner of the motel (Anthony Perkins) sure does pull off that creepy image. Making just about every scene suspenseful.I just ended up loving this movie so much. Alfred Hitchcock again blew me away with his outstanding directing and film making. If you haven't seen this movie yet you should.",Psycho
593,harry-austin,The first and best 'slasher suspense' film ever created.,9,26 August 2009,"I watched this fairly recently, it stood out to me, for I already appreciated that this is THE HORROR film, the one that comes to mind (shower scene with high pitched music). But for me, what is so marvellous about this film, is that it has not been ruined by adding pointless sex scenes or having countless 'stereotypical blonds' being slaughtered by the thousand, for that is all one will typically see in the slasher movies of the past 20 years. It gave me some relief to see a film that was pure genius in terms of acting, directing (Hitchcock, the best) and how the camera is shot from what was originally seen as and still is seen as rather unusual angles. Instead of the naked blonde teen being killed by the lakeside in the height of summer or in bed with her lover straight into the film, Psycho has some background to it. Lila Crane (Vera Miles)is on the run after stealing a large sum of money, and we see her for the fist 10 or 15 minutes of the film driving anxiously out of the city with the constant fear of being caught or tracked down. She then stops of for a rest at the Bates Motel, and from there the story slowly unfolds at a rate that is not so fast the film just gets far to unreal, but at a rate that allows you to get a good idea of the persona's of the characters, especially Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and it gives you time to wonder, why does him mother sit by the window for such long periods of time without moving an inch? I will leave that for you to find out.",Psycho
594,Bobson10,A boy's best friend is his mother.,9,12 April 2013,"Directed by Alfred HitchcockStarring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin.Written by Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch'A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and subsequently encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.'Upon the arrival of the new hit series 'Bates Motel' it has gotten me in a 'Psycho' mood. This was my first Alfred Hitchcock film and I must admit when I watched it, I broke the legendary Director's first and only rule : ""The picture you MUST see from the beginning... Or not at all!""'Psycho' is one of those films I put with the elite like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Amadeus and The Godfather Series. These films changed my perspective on film in some form or another and when I speak about Psycho, I'm referring to storytelling and camera usage. Alfred Hitchcock did an amazing job creating this film. Everything works! The story, the acting, the cinematography and the music! Hitchcock's efforts with the camera reminded me of 'Taxi Driver.' Often, the camera stole so much away from the actors' efforts when creating emotion on screen. There were positions and movements I've never seen before. The classic 'Shower Scene' reminded me a lot of Scorsese due to the fact of the quick cuts throughout and I'm not surprised Scorsese would take a few notes from Hitch.The acting in this picture is something people never really emphasize and it is deservingly so. Not taking anything away from the actors/actresses but it was how 'Psycho' was shot that people will remember forever. But the cast was great! I will point out that I really enjoyed Anthony Perkins' fantastic performance as the legendary Norman Bates. When you see Perkins on screen, it's as if he has an extra layer around him that you want to rip off to reveal something you shouldn't know. You can see he's hiding something of some sort and you want to just shake it out of him. He keeps you on your toes throughout the film and you won't be able to blink without missing a detail.Out of all the aspects I pointed out about 'Psycho', the music comes out as the triumphant winner. It's suspense at its finest! As Janet Leigh's character tries to escape with the $40,000, the music itself tells you everything you need to know about the emotions running through her body. The quick beats and violins' running imitating a heartbeat gives you goose bumps. But nothing is more terrifying than the screeching violins playing throughout the 'mother' scenes. A nice test everybody can attempt is to play the scenes without the music, you will see the impact the sounds has on the film. As every screech is heard, you flinch back and back with discomfort and want it to stop. Truth be told, Hitchcock originally wanted those scenes silent and we can all agree he would've made a huge mistake! It's absolute magic!Psycho is a film that everybody should experience not only for entertainment purposes but as a history lesson in terrific filmmaking. It's difficult attempting to review this film without giving away anything but if you haven't seen 'Psycho', don't make the same mistake I did. Watch it from the beginning and don't stop",Psycho
595,bruscinoa833,Psycho,9,10 May 2010,"Psycho was the first of its kind in many respects, most notably would be the violence and sexuality that was shown in the film. The film opens with a shot of two lovers threw a hotel window then goes on show Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, changing in her hotel room and of course, the infinite shower scene which combines nudity with violence. Such violence had never been shown before in fact caused a great deal of terror within audiences and although film has certainly progressed in terms of the allowance of sexuality and violence this film is yet to seem outdated. In fact, any of the scenes the involve Norman Bates still terrify me. Hitchcock allows the interactions between Marion Crane and Norman Bates to unfold slowly and switches the camera's point of view back and forth between Norman's when he is observing Marion and the omniscient allowing the audience to watch Marion go about her business in the motel room this adds to the suspense during the entire beginning of the film. Anthony Perkins is outstanding in his role as Norman Bates and his mother of course. He plays his role so well that the audience fears and feels for him. He allows the audience to see the struggle between his wants and the control his mother still has over him. There is nothing bad I can say about this film it is fabulous in every aspect.",Psycho
596,Emillion,"""We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you ?""",9,9 December 2014,"Easily one of my all time favorite movies. Hitchcook never disappoints and Psycho is no exception. The story is very simple and straight forward with a great twist at the end that catches audience members by surprise ( although I wasn't so easily fooled. Hitchcook using several foreshadowing techniques and focused shots to push the audience towards a conclusion. His shots, while often simple, are very effective; for example the low lighting and the back-lit people allows the audience to see the outline of the killer but no specific details beyond that. The shower seen was especially brilliant with a wide variety of rapid shots and insinuated actions. Overall the film is amazingly made and a stepping stone for all psycho thrillers to come.",Psycho
597,El_Guapo9,"""We all go a little mad sometimes, haven't you?""",10,9 July 2004,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is one of my favorite films of all time and the best horror film I have ever seen.  Hitchcock does a great job of telling a story with a film, not necessarily pointing everything out to viewer, but keeping the viewer on their toes the whole time.  Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is the heroine of the story who steals $40,000 of her boss's money and flees the city.  Twists and turns abound as Marion is followed by a police officer for much of her trip neither her nor us knowing what he knows or why he finds her suspicious.Eventually Marion meets up with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who runs a run-down hotel much like any you could find along any highway anywhere in the country.  What follows is one of the most famous scenes and events in motion picture history.  If you don't know yet, I won't ruin it for you.Hitchcock is at his best messing with the audience's heads in this flick, in my opinion right up there with his stellar story in ""North by Northwest."" The film is a great thriller and a great horror film that takes you on a roller coaster throughout all the events that take place. 
Not much can top ""Psycho"" and I'm not sure if there is anything that could be done to improve it.  It is just that good.10 out of 10.",Psycho
598,timothy-pinzone,My Psychotic Love for this Movie,10,9 March 2015,"Psycho... What can I say of the greatest thriller ever made? Only repeating what others before me have said time and time again. This is absolutely brilliant no other movie can depict such horror and schizophrenic thriller that could not possibly be remade successfully as the genius Mr Alfred Hitchcock could.Horror today is all over the place with poor production, poor storytelling, poor filmmaking and everything else that is wrong with them. What they don't understand is that the best horror movies need the process that Psycho takes, not just gore and bloodshed but story, emotion and Psycho is how it is done right. The perfect character development, perfect pace, excellent characters and casting and the most shady villain of all cinema history. If you haven't seen it. Watch it. Anyone that wants to study film needs to watch this and learn what true horror is and if only producers would look at this and make horror today like it was in the old days because it truly is horror and thriller at its best.Grade: A+ Comment: Horror made right.",Psycho
599,BatmanAndRobyn,Easily a classic thriller film!,10,10 May 2013,"I absolutely LOVED this film. Every single part of it. The pace was perfect and I never got bored watching it.First off, the cinematography was spectacular. The cinematographer used many high angle and low angle shots to emphasize fear or other feelings throughout the film. The angles paired with the lighting made for some really unforgettable shots in the film. I also enjoyed the sound. Although there was very minimal music, I thought it was really effective every time it played. You would just get relaxed while watching the film, then the classic horror music plays and jolts you back into awareness. I'll also admit that the huge plot twist at the end completely threw me for a whirl. I don't know how I didn't see it coming, but it really surprised me when it happened. The acting was really great too, especially from Anthony Perkins. His performance as Norman Bates had the perfect amount of subtlety and and crazy that made for a truly unforgettable character. Honestly, if the movie had been made with any other actor than him as Norman, it just wouldn't have been the same. I thought the simplicity, yet complexity of the final scene was also really great too. That paired with the internal dialogue coming from Norman was just excellent. I would recommend this movie to anyone.",Psycho
600,codymontanye,Obviously Great,9,13 May 2015,"It's hard to say anything about this movie because it has probably all been said before, but I found Hitchcock's Psycho to be undeniably great. Embarrassingly enough I had just watched this movie recently for the first time ever and of course loved it. The film is filled with so many twists and turns from beginning to end that kept me on my toes, although I already knew of most of them already because I'm clearly the only person who hadn't seen the film. I loved the plot of the movie and how the viewer starts off thinking about the girl and the stolen money, when in fact it isn't about that at all. I also believe that this film is one of the best examples of Hitchcock's mastery of suspense. There are so many scenes that are filmed in such a way that really amps up the viewer's anxiety and I'm not just talking about the shower or stair scene. I think the scene that really showed this was towards the beginning of the film when the cop pulled up behind the woman. I loved how they filmed this scene because they filmed the cop from the point of view of the driver side mirror, which kind of made you anxious because it made you feel like you were being pulled over. I could say so much more about the greatness of this classic, but I'm going to stop before I repeat everything else that has ever been said about this movie.",Psycho
601,joedebritz,Hitchcock at his best,8,13 May 2015,"This is a brilliant film. It takes a little bit of getting used to, it can come off as a little corny at first, but once you get sucked into it, the movie is amazing. I believe that is pretty much paved the way for every single horror movie after it. It is a testament to the genius of Alfred Hitchcock. He really understood suspense and how it effects the audience. The Shots in the is film are brilliantly planned out. They make you think exactly what you are supposed to think, until you learn what is really happening. I already knew what was going to happen when I saw this movie, yet it was still shocking. that is what makes it so great.",Psycho
602,cleigh115,Classic Thriller!,10,11 May 2015,"I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock. Every movie that I've seen by him has been excellent. This one, however, is my favorite. Psycho is brilliant. Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was fantastic. Hitchcock builds the tension and constantly keeps you on your toes. His use of camera angles is superb. This, all while keeping the movie moving along at a brisk pace. At no stage does it drift, or get bogged down. It's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impactful. I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else. I recommend this film to everyone. It's full of twists, turns and surprises that keep you guessing write till the end, and I mean the very end. You can't take your eyes of the screen. You're engrossed by these characters and the plot that you don't want to miss a second.",Psycho
603,maryolalov,A horror classic,8,1 February 2019,I'm not a fan of Hitchcock's works but I have to admit that I really enjoyed this one. The plot is intriguing and makes you watch the movie with interest till the very end.The cinematography isn't perfect but I'll omit this fact because after all Psycho is from 1960 and no one expects its cinematography to be as good as the one in the movie from the next decades.The acting was good. Of course there are a few scenes with overacting such as the one where Marion gets murdered but that's not of vital importance for the overall acting in the movie.The plot is as I already said intriguing and well thought. It is the greatest thing in this movie and is there probably the only reason why Psycho is considered an all time horror classic.,Psycho

And yeah I hear you saying that this was the first of a kind and how it started the trend that we see in movies and yes I know, but lets look at the movies made by Kubrick, his movies are still very unique, and many have tried to imitate his style but frankly most of them never work out, his movies are evergreen.(2) Predictable - The major twist like the guy being the dead mother was very obvious from the moment I first saw the mother from the window, coz c'mon who stands so perfectly still. The only spoiler I had was the shower scene, that's unavoidable.(3) Horror (or the lack of it) - As I am used to much more horror elements in movies and no I am not talking about gore in movies, if you have watched Hereditary or The Other or The Lighthouse you know what I mean, it does not stand a chance against such movies.If you find my review hurt you feelings, Im sorry.But if you want to debate me or chat with me you can contact me at Icy_Jaam on reddit.",Psycho

It's a fateful stop off at the backwoods Bates Motel that changes Marion's life forever when she meets Norman - the boyish motel manager who has a strange relationship with his emotionally abusive mother.Hitchcock created his most perfect film when he decided to adapt Robert Bloch's novel of the same name and turn it into the movie event of the year - even going as far as to tell patrons they wouldn't be seated until the previous screening had come to a close. Hitchock's daring twists are still shocking to this day and his visual language is out of this world.",Psycho
606,a-65018,WOW!,9,10 April 2020,"What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, ""is not herself today."" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that ""Do-Not-Disturb"" sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word ""falsity"" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up ""Mother's"" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for ""Psycho."" Certainly ""Psycho"" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, ""Psycho"" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready.",Psycho

608,ralphgillis,The Greatest Horror Film Ever Made?,9,3 October 2021,"October 3 2000Psycho is considered a cult classic and it is directed by Alfred Hitchcock and this is without a doubt his most renowned film. I saw it for the first time today and I understand all the praise it receives, it's the definition of a perfect horror film.Psycho tells a simple story of a woman who is going rogue with 40,000 dollars in her pocket. When she's in her car, rain starts pouring so she inevitably decides to stop at a tiny and secluded motel. Little does she know that the owner is a crazed psychopath.Filming Psycho in black and white only helps the movie become the cult classic it has turned out to be today, imagine watching the shower scene without the B&W filter, it definitely wouldn't have the same effect. And it doesn't just help certain iconic scenes, it makes the whole movie feel ominous and very sinister. The characters are just remarkable and the most memorable of them all is Norman Bates. It's exciting to delve into this character's hidden psychotic personality. Throughout the movie's runtime he is almost winking at us, giving us hints that we shouldn't be fooled by his formal appearance, he is controlling his sociopathic behaviour inside of him. He does not want to unveil his second personality to the audience until the very end. He is a frightening character because he looks completely normal but there is this impending doom and terror that follows him around wherever he goes. You have the feeling he's a disturbed individual but you don't get enough proof to fully be sure of it.The setting is very chilling and can often be hair-raising. There are multiple frames of the dreary, gloomy, dull and greyish mansion that Norman Bates considers his world. The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful. The camera setups manipulate the audience and ultimately hides them from the truth. Another element of the film that we barely ever see in modern films is when the main character dies in the first act. She was the central figure of the story but her sudden death moves her out of the spotlight and she inevitably becomes a false protagonist.I highly recommend Psycho, it could almost be perceived as a character study. Every dialogue and frame is iconic, it stands the test of time and has the privilege of calling itself the greatest horror movie ever made.",Psycho

I started watching it when Janet Leigh was getting ready to leave about fifteen minutes in.Terrific, flawless acting and directing jobs are done here. WHY DIDN'T IT WIN ANY OSCARS? I have repeatedly been asking myself this question. The adapted screenplay was awesome as well, and the ending was ABSOLUTE GENIUS (but I'm not gonna tell you what it is). My ten-year-old brother had to leave in the middle of the movie, so we taped about the last half hour (yea, I get to watch it again!), and he liked what he's seen. Now I just have to not tell him the ending...One minor note, though: Viewers everywhere think it's a mistake that there was blood all over the wall after the shower scene, and when Norman Bates comes in there isn't. Hello, wasn't the shower still on? It could have washed off the blood.Overall, brilliant, and yes, perfect.

611,thecole777,What I expected.,8,16 December 2011,I've always wanted to see this film because I'm a fan of the horror genre so I was happy to finally watch it. It was just as I had expected in that it was great. The music really made the movie and was really well done. It made the scenes more frightening and more intense. I can see why this is a classic. I loved every scene with Norman dressed up as his mother because of the cinematography and music and how scary it was. But I don't know if I agree with Norman living at the end. I don't see the harm in it and I wouldn't have minded seeing him perish at the end either. The character of Norman was well done by Anthony Perkins. He brought a richness to the character.,Psycho

But then when you saw it again, you anticipate in dread. So it's got REPLAY VALUE. Excellent photograpy and camera work. The house on the hill sure is spooky.

Although I did not find it scary compared to many of the movie and thrillers that you see in the modern movie age. Overall I rather enjoyed watching Psycho after hearing so much about it over the years and I would recommend for anyone to see it at least once.",Psycho
614,JoshuaC96,Psycho,6,7 November 2010,"I didn't really like Hitchcock's Psycho.The plot is way dated by today's standards. You can tell the film was made specifically to shock audiences in 1960, but today it fails miserably to be convincing; especially because of the film's constant attempts to keep you convinced that Norman's mother is the real killer. The film stresses this so much that other aspects of the plot suffer. For example, characters hardly ever have any logical thoughts/theories and don't make logical decisions or actions. I pretty much figured out that he'd already killed his mom from the moment her ""character"" is introduced. I'm sure the film was fantastic when it first came out, but to me it just isn't any more. I can understand why many people would find the film to be really good. It was definitely groundbreaking and utilized a lot of interesting camera and editing techniques. Also I thought that Anthony Perkins' performance was great. However, it is by no means a timeless film like most of the movies we've seen in class. I'm sure I missed some deeper meaning or theme in Physco, but I was far too distracted to think about it and could hardly enjoy the film.",Psycho
615,alexv1208,Review of Psycho,9,7 December 2010,"There is so much to be said about Psycho, from its profound cinematography to the provocative script. Alfred Hitchcock is well known for his horror films, and Psycho definitely proves why. The plot behind the movie really broke a mold for horror films during the 1960's. Movies were become more ""expressive"", and leaving less unsaid, but Psycho revealed some truths behind sex and violence that weren't discussed in society. Alfred Hitchcock helped to change what society thought of as true terror. There was a realness to his films, unlike the studio era horror films. His use of the camera was truly remarkable. It's obvious that Hitchcock knew how to add suspense and fear. His way of showing the actor's reaction then what they were looking at, makes it feel like you are in the film. Also, the famous shower scene depicts how some things are better left to the imagination. Not because it's too much for the audience to handle, but because it makes the viewer think and fill in the blanks in a way. It was obvious that the woman had been killed, but it's more frightening in a way to leave out the whole scene. It adds that gasp effect. Clearly, Psycho was a somewhat ground breaking film, and really paved the way for horror films in general.",Psycho
616,E-reilly3,Horror,6,11 May 2011,"I don't really like horror films but this one was OK. I found it very suspenseful which helped keep my attention. I liked the murder in the shower scene because it is a great example of an early movie right after the abolishment of the Hayes code. Never before were we able to see a showering woman murdered. This is one of the most influential and memorable scenes in not only horror films but American films in general. The beginning of the movie seemed very real and I think helped me get into the movie. The only thing is I don't get why she was trusted with that much money, I feel that is pretty unrealistic, however it is a movie so anything goes. Overall pretty good horror movie and it definitely paved the way for the modern day gory horrors we watch today.",Psycho
617,danburyn,Classic Hitchcock!,8,18 April 2012,"this movie is what Hitchcock was all about the over emotional characters to create tension, using the camera as another character interacting with the movie, has characters break cliché'e, and using suspense as information. these things are just some of the things that he really showed within this movie. in regards to the lighting of the movie is quite stunning, when you see the outside of the house he makes look very bright making it look welcoming. though when any character entered the house, it is very dark and mysterious. the contrast he used in the movie were quite interesting. for example when the lady is being killed in the shower the contrast of the blood on the white tile and white tub gives the flow of blood definition. another interesting thing about that scene is you never see the knife make contact with the lady. it always has a jump cut to a blood splatter or it running down the drain. over all i think this is one of his best movies, the way he keeps you on the edge of your seat makes a movie for me and a added bonus is when a movie can continue to do it no matter how many times you see it!",Psycho

To my discretion, movie like these made in the 60's never really caught my attention because I wasn't a big fan of them. I enjoy movies where there are two sides to a person because it confuses you and have you thinking its anther person.

Alfred Hitchcock made the scene seem so real, but without even showing Marion getting stabbed. Marion's sister and friend come looking for her and soon find out the truth(which i will not give away). The ending was very unpredictable, and well done.

Hitchcock surely is the master of suspense and it shows very much in this movie. on the DVD version there is a ""making of psycho"" feature and it talks about the decision Hitchcock made to shoot the movie in black and white because he thought it would be too gory in color, in my opinion it would not have been too gory, but it certainly would not have felt the same. this film is an absolute classic suspense movie and if you haven't seen it yet i would definitely recommend it.",Psycho

So in order to become a film critic, we needed to learn about the history of films. Psycho was a film that we needed to know the history of. Not being a fan of scary movies, watching this over and over again never gets old. The fact that this film was such a success to Hitchcock's life makes it a better watch. Also the fact that this is the film that all other films, including horror films, make reference to this very movie. The references stem from the music that plays, the scenes that were made, and the shots that were created. This film is the godfather of all horror films, to say the least. The history behind this film makes it a phenomenal film. Seeing the new released film Hitchcock, about the making of the movie with the leading star Anthony Hopkins as Hitchcock, has the original Psycho make so much more sense to those who haven't had the opportunity to study the history of this film. Both movies, recommended see.",Psycho

This has a lot of scenes that I remember, like the infamous shower scene. This is considered the most famous horror scene ever made. I even felt a little scared when I saw it. There are some more good parts about this film, like it had some good camera shots, it was scary and horrifying, and it had a lot of good acting in it. The shower scene sums up the film and the genre perfectly. The only flaw that I found in this one was the setup that it used. It was in black-and-white, but that's one thing about this film that makes it stand out like some of the others. Overall, this happens to be one of the greatest yet most frightening horror movie that I've ever seen.",Psycho

This film is filled with creepy in-harmonic sounds that we have becomes so used to in horror and suspenseful films. The build up in the suspenseful scenes really have feeling uncomfortable. Hitchcock knows how to get his viewers on the edge of their seat and we see that in full effect in this masterpiece. This film is one of the greatest written story lines and has such a fantastic dialog. This is an art that has been completely lost in our modern genre of ""horror"". Character's seem to have no depth and the killing takes priority over the plot in our more recent slasher type films. Psycho has done so much for the genre of horror. Horror movies need to step up their game because this film set a crazy high standard in 1960 that may not have been toped.",Psycho
624,MC_Barton,"""A boy's best friend is his mother""",9,30 March 2015,"""Psycho"" is a masterpiece in all sense of the meaning. It has the two aspects that makes for a riveting adventure into an alternate reality of horror, both aesthetic and apparent qualities. Horror movies are a major component of societal culture and are often executed with the objective of just frightening the viewer with predictable methods such as jump scares or disgusting content. However, once in a while, comes along a psychological horror film that is able to rattle the sense of being and challenge the moral compass of an individual, and ""Psycho"" is one of those films. Needless to say the real fear elicited from the film is that fact that a monster resides in such a normal, compassionate, and kind Norman Bates. Hiding his true intentions, he turns into one of the most provocative killers ever portrayed in any movie and has become a cultural icon. The shower scene in particular needs mentioning, the killing out of context doesn't really have an impact, but taking into account that the protagonist has just been killed about halfway through the movie gives a sense of vulnerability and is truly a shock that is worth noting. If you haven't seen this film, watch it.",Psycho
625,aladar-219-783287,Psycho - My Review,8,27 April 2015,"I've seen this long before the film classes I took. I remember watching it for the first time and really liking it, and it struck me as a different film I could thoroughly enjoy simply for its content and camera work. Of course it had the famous shower scene, but how everything was put together was just so, so pretty. Its black and white film is stunning and crisp, and even the opening credits were interesting to watch.I'm not really sure why certain characters did what they did since it sometimes made them seem out of character, but I guess for the sake of its environment and sequence of events it made sense for what it was. The lighting was great too, especially when the main lead talks with Norman with his taxidermy in the hotel rooms. It looks so eerie yet it draws you in and you want to know more about it when you see it. That and I could see how this movie could be so inspirational for future filmmakers, especially with shows based off of this film like Bates Motel (which I need to watch), simply because Norman's relationship with his mother was mysterious and vague, yet the film showed just enough for you to get the best impression without too much of an explanation. Then again, would anyone really want to know? Considering what happened? All in all, a pretty good watch and something I would recommend to anybody looking for something interesting to watch.",Psycho
626,hagen2357,Psycho Review,7,13 May 2015,"Never seeing this film or any other work of Alfred Hitchcock, I was intrigued to see what many people loved about him. There is just something different about him, but in a good way. First of all, Psycho was released in 1960 in black and white. At this point in film history, almost every single movie that was released was in color and watching this film definitely gave it the feeling of a film released in the 1930s-40s. The shower murder scene is one of the most famous scenes in film history and is definitely worth noting. Never seeing the scene in its entirety, I wasn't sure what to expect. Originally I was a little bit disappointed in the realism of the scene but after further analysis, I realized that Hitchcock might have done this on purpose just to fit his mold of uniqueness. Overall, I was a fan of the film as the suspense seemed to build tremendously behind a very creepy character of Norman Bates. I'm not sure if I would call myself a huge Alfred Hitchcock fan but his work is certainly unique.",Psycho
627,m-carter-68742,Horror classic,10,17 December 2015,"Wow, just wow. Horror films in the early 60's were not what people today would necessarily call ""scary"" but at some points in this film I did find my adrenaline pumping. It is kind of dark to say the Marion got a heavy dose of Karma when she is killed in the shower, but this is where things get interesting. We learn that Normans mother, Norma, has been dead for 10 years. The realization that Norman took his mothers persona was interesting. This film is based on a true serial killer, Ed Gein, who did similar things to Norman. Music was important in setting the mood for specific scenes. Lighting was key in this film with the placement of shadows on the characters. Shadows were important also to show movement of shadows. Editing was important for some of the montages that were used in this film. Overall the film is considered a classic and has set a standard for horror films. Though there have been plenty of horror films made after this, I still consider this to be truly amazing.",Psycho
628,k-ellinger,Fantastic,10,4 April 2016,"Alfred Hitchcock was the master of making films full of suspense and horror. Hitchcock is able to get into the mind of his viewers and leave them shocked and horrified that anyone could do what Norman Bates did. The title describes exactly what Norman Bates is. A psycho. Even though this movie is old school and filming has changed and improved a lot since this movie came out, I still believe today's generation can still sit and enjoy this movie. In this psychological thriller, viewers are left screaming at their T.V. screen trying to tell the characters to get out while they can. This popular 1960 horror film was so successful, there was a current television series created that is just as successful as the movie.",Psycho
629,CriticalViewing,"Aw, what a sweet....psychopath?!",9,7 May 2016,"This film by Alfred Hitchcock does a very good job of hiding the twist ending that comes. My summary line doesn't even begin to tell of what one can expect to see when viewing this film. Through use of close-ups, Hitchcock shows us the facial expression of how a particular character feels by minor changes in their face, even more so their eyes. He enjoys the use of reverse shots, but in his case, I feel they up the sense of suspense through primarily upping the tension one feels during this movie after the famous shower scene. Because if that happened within the first 20 minutes of the film, when will the next, over an hour, time left of this film?! So Hitchcock already has us invested and a bit uneasily inquisitive, to where we're itching to want to low what happens next. The magnetic film is also accentuated by the use of voice-overs not by the on- screen person. The 2 main ones are during the time Marion Crane rushed away into the night after she's committed her crime; the second was at the end, when inner voices, voices that may or may not be one's own, come out to play and act very ""tell tale heart"" with how easily the latter contributes. This film will shock, captivate, and engaging discussion, and a lack of realism that is beneficial to the telling of the film. If one has not seen it, buyer beware, the shower scene will forever be scorched into your memory.",Psycho
630,Andrew-162,"Hitch's 2nd Best, But That Is Saying A Whole Lot",10,30 June 2000,"Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is probably the best horror movie ever made, and though slightly inferior to his Vertigo, it remains a true showcase of the master's talent. Though I was not around the 1st time the movie came out, I was lucky enough to recently catch a screening of it, with a guest appearance by Janet Leigh. I had already seen the movie twice, and anticipated everything that was about to happen, but it didn't really matter. It still scared me so much, I was petrified to think how terrified I would be if I saw it in the theaters in 1960, not knowing what was about to happen. We all know the plot--Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles 40,000 dollars from her company and is on the run. She stops at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a friendly young man who is restrained from being close to anyone but his possessive mother. They talk, and she gets in the shower. Before she is done her shower, she is stabbed to death by Norman's mother. But who really stabbed her? And is she really dead? Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Marion's boyfriend (Jon Gavin) hire detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to investigate. Then he is similarly stabbed to death before he can question Norman's mother.... Psycho is simply amazing, one of the true artistic pieces of the cinema. Joseph Stefano's disturbing, sick screenplay will not soon be forgotten, though the plot is not the main part of the movie. The cinematography is some of the best ever put on the screen, from the several pans from the Bates Motel to Norman's house to the opening shot across the city. It is dark--undeniably bleak and dark, as is the mood of the movie. The art direction is necessarily scary--Norman's house is perfectly secluded from the rest of the world, and looks very spooky, as does the motel. As Balsam notes, the hotel seems to be ""hiding from the world."" The acting varies--Balsam is quite good as the always suspicious detective, Leigh is ideally cast as the every day woman who sees a chance to get away from life and takes it, and Perkins is nothing less than fantastic as Norman Bates, a roll that would define his career, and one he will always be associated with. However, Miles and Gavin are wooden anti-characters with no personality whatsoever showing. But that really doesn't matter. Hitchcock liked the idea from the start--getting a big star and killing her off in the first reel. It certainly shocked audiences, who before came into movies whenever they wanted, sometimes even 30 minutes to an hour into the movie. They were not allowed to do that with Psycho. ""The film you should see from the beginning--or not at all"" the taglines stated. Psycho is a perfect example of audience manipulation--everyone assumes that the story is about Leigh, and when she gets bumped off, Hitchcock takes the audience down a completely different road. The shower scene is one of the most memorable and suprprising scenes in film history. The scenes in which Leigh is driving are suspenseful, even though there's nothing really happening. And when Perkins is trying to dispose of Leigh's car by pushing it into the swamp, the way the car stops sinking for a second--everyone suddenly wonders what he will do now--but then it sinks away again. Surprisingly enough, the audience wants the car to go down--we want Perkins to get rid of the evidence. And untrue to Horror formula, the climax of Psycho takes place not in a rainy dark night--but in the bright, sunny daylight. These are all examples of audience manipulation--which no one does better than Alfred Hitchcock. But yet--Hitchcock's direction, I think, is not the best part of the movie--or at least it is tied for first. The best? BERNARD HERRMANN. If you do not know that name yet, write it down. BERNARD HERRMANN. He has done the score to the Hitchcock movies Marnie, The Birds, The Wrong Man, North By Northwest, Vertigo (ohh, the Vertigo score), and Psycho. He also did the score to Scorcese's Taxi Driver, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. He won an oscar for his score for The Devil And Daniel Webster. His score for Psycho is certainly his most well known--especially the shower scene part. Though not his best (Vertigo is his best) the score is the part of Psycho that stays with you after the film is done, days after. That keeps haunting you, that keeps scaring you. Psycho would be three or four times less scary without the shrieking violins of Herrmann's score. Herrmann also pulled an exercise in audience manipulation--for the score, frightening as it is, consisted of only 4 violins. The music truly sets the mood for the movie. Creating the madness and worry in Marion's mind while she is driving, creating the true horror of the murders, and creating the calm but suspenseful serenity of some of the dialogues, where there is no music at all, and the film is eerily silent. You know the shrieking violins are soon. Bernard Herrmann's scores are not often enough credited as a huge, HUGE part Hitchcock's success with his pictures. So write that name down if you don't know it already: BERNARD HERRMANN. And see Psycho. If you've already seen it, see it again to catch the little things you missed before. I guarantee you there are some.",Psycho

Sometimes the camera gets really close and it feels awkward and disconcerting. There are so many uncomfortable moments in this film. It toys with you. It didn't shy away from taboo subjects. You honestly don't know where it will go until you get there. Anthony Perkins is amazing in this, he's both very human and likable but uncomfortably awkward at the same time.

In addition, I looked at the bar that shows the time of the movie; it was just in the middle of the movie, this encouraged my curiosity to know what was going on and what would happen to the money. The scene of murdering is really classic, especially when the camera zoom out of her eye slowly. Besides, taking a shower is the time to feel relax, is not any idea or attention in the mind. Therefore, when the murder show up, it break down unconscious and makes the audience feel frightened. Nevertheless, it is weird because we could not see the knife touch her body. Moreover, the scene that after she bought the new car, we would hear the voice of the conversation while she was driving. These voices told the other parts of the story that help the audience more understand. Furthermore, the setting is really good, especially the house with the perfect quantity of the light is very horrible. Plus, there are a lot background musics that make the movie more scary and excited.

During the horror scenes and the ending is when the movie really got interesting and even though the music was incredibly cheesy it worked well with the film.

Janet Leigh screaming in the shower is the seminal horror film image of all time. The movie has some of the best plot twists toward the middle I've ever seen, the control of climax and character study, their psychology and manners is impressive. There's a pleasurable amount of photographic technique and detail, of precision throughout the film and that makes it lasting. There's very little gore or violence which is great, because it leaves that up to the imagination unlike other films. Some of the actors come across brilliantly in their creepiness and darkness, and their motives aren't always exactly known, the thrill is skillfully and cleverly composed and arranged and released throughout the film, it lives up to its name.",Psycho

I watch a clip of the shower scene without the music and it didn't feel even half as climatic. The cinematography through out the film was very well done.

Hitchcock is a truly talented director, with many good movies, but this one is definitely up there on his list of great movies directed by him. The plot of ""Psycho"" is extremely engaging. It has a viewer on the edge of their seat during the entire movie. This movie also has some major plot twists that cause the viewer to question what in fact they are actually watching, but since it is a Hitchcock film, that should be expected.

Just hearing the movie's title will inspire the image of Janet Leigh screaming in the shower. Hitchcock did this movie flawlessly - it almost seems silly to review this film because it's common knowledge how perfect it is. The acting is absolutely impeccable. I would almost say that Tony Perkins played Norman Bates too well because he was never really able to be anything ever again. The similar paradox of Bela Lugosi, who could never escape his ""Dracula"" image. I was lucky enough (lucky only for the fact that it gave me an extra element of analysis ability of the original) to see the re-make of Psycho. The movie was pretty much a duplicate, yet just not as good. It's sometimes hard to identify perfect acting, because that's the whole point of it: to not notice the acting. But after watching the shot-for-shot remake and realizing it was no where near as good as the original, my respect for the actors and the black and white cinematography grew even deeper than it already was. Hitchcock's ability to do horror without gore is fantastic.",Psycho

I'm pretty sure this film is to blame for my early and unending love of thrillers and horror films (only the good ones though). As usual, the photography is my favorite part, as well as the editing, since both aid each other extremely well. I'm not even going to touch the shower scene, that's been analyzed to death (but I do love it). My favorite part of the photography is when she's asleep in the car, and the cop comes and talks to her through the window. The close ups in that scene are amazing. A+ acting too, perfect amount of tension. I also like when she's driving and all the bright lights are blinding her from the other side of the road. I'm so pleased they decided to film this is b&w.There are a couple other things I'd like to mention too. First, this film totally flaunts the code, right from the opening scene. I normally wouldn't have noticed it as a casual viewer but bearing in mind film history, this is the beginning of the end of the code (finally!). Second, the score is absolutely brilliant. About 90% of my music collection is film scores and I've been a fan of Bernard Herrmann since realizing he did a great number of soundtracks for Hitchcock films (North by Northwest is great, and some non Hitchcock films like Mysterious Island are good too). But wow, the Psycho score is really quite amazing. It's so unobtrusive yet brilliantly sets the mood. And I'm not talking about the screeching strings, even though they're the most famous.",Psycho

I have to imagine when Alfred Hitchcock made this film he was having fun and wanted the film to be as fun for us as it was for him. It's one of my favorite scary movies, but when I look back to it I don't think of it at all like I do the others on the list. This movie is just a good time.If Psycho was a person, and its fun, creepy atmosphere was its skin, and Anthony Perkins was its face I guess, Its structure would be a crazy adamantite skeleton and its pacing? Well, synthetic cyborg muscles of course. For a horror film to maintain the feeling it needs to keep its viewers attention in the events leading up to the scares, it needs to have a solid setup for the plot that goes on long enough for it to not feel rushed but not so overlong that it becomes boring and takes away from the impact of the scary moments it's building up to. It needs to be interesting enough to not feel like a chore, but still understand its role as a vehicle for the frightening moments in the films. The story takes a back seat to the scary stuff in a horror movie. The good ones understand this, but the best of them do it in a way that doesn't compromise the quality of the story. Psycho is a shining example of a balanced and well executed horror film narrative. It's the king of this technique. the events leading up to Marion Crane's trip to the Bates motel work exceptionally well, and her encounters with the police officers at the dealership and on the road do an amazing job of establishing the spooky feel of the film in a seamless way and work to keep the viewer interested in what's to come. The ease with which Hitchcock leads into the events that take place at the motel are a huge part of what allows him to make the film such a good time.You can't sing the praises of Psycho without applauding the incredible work Anthony Perkins does as the film's criminally insane leading man- the one and only Norman motherloving Bates. Perkins' ability to personify a person with such a severe case of dissociative identity disorder is so unbelievably good you'd think this guy went home at the end of the day and lived life as Norman Bates instead of himself. Not only does he have such an intrinsic ability to play the psycho, but he does such an impeccable job of committing Norman's crimes as well. When he sneaks up on the woman in the legendary and absolutely immortal shower scene, he does so like he was made to be a movie monster, and when he rushes in to attack the detective to the sound of Bernard Herrmann's screeching soundtrack he could scare a banana straight out of its goshdang peel. And bananas don't even have eyes or ears or even watch movies in the first place.I love this film. it's a champion of horror. In a genre where so many films can only be fun by sacrificing the scares or just by being low budget bargain bin Netflix dumpster movies, Psycho triumphs in its ability to conquer everything important to entertain horror fans. Alfred Hitchcock's talent is so palpable in this film it may just as well turn itself into a big spoonful of Bates flavored gelato and fly its way right into the brain mouths of everyone watching. Gelato only has half the calories of regular ice cream, too. You ever try it? It's like ice cream pudding. It's great. Just like this film.",Psycho
644,anthonydavid-25706,Psycho Review,8,18 December 2015,"Psycho is probably Alfred Hitchcock's most popular film, and after watching it you know why. This is a terrific film, it keeps you on the edge of your seat at all times. The cinematography and camera work is legendary, the classic shower scenes come to mind. For being a product of what still known as old Hollywood, Hitchcock still manages to make it feel as if this could be a modern story. Alfred Hitchcock is described to be one of the great American film directors, and you can see why after watching this film. Psycho is truly a masterpiece through and through, from the gut wrenching sound effects,dramatic music, and epic camera angles, I would recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of horror thrillers.",Psycho
645,m-meehan-28239,psycho,7,13 May 2016,This movie really influenced horror movies today so its a great film and easy to appreciate. The use of loud and sharp music adds to the fear. The shower scene is a great example of a lot of things the music that starts to play to imply something sinister is about to happen. The Hand holding the knife and the terrified expressions. All of that is intense. The most brutal part to me though is actually after the killing because the girl is just dead on the shower floor and all wee see is her face and the entire time the shower Is still running that right there is chilling. The shower still going is so genuine the fact that the clip doesn't end right after the act just makes the murder feel real like shes dead and there is nothing left but the water. This film is filled with groundbreaking shots. That being said I find Hitchcock to be a little corny in instances. Like sometimes someone will walk back too far and fall off something to their death and that just seems dumb to me but all in all this was a good movie.,Psycho
646,nbbaiyuchen,HVCC Student Yuchen Bai Review,9,3 April 2016,"Overall I really enjoyed this movie, I was in face surprised by the twist ending and I really enjoyed how well done that was. For a movie of the 1960's it holds its own when compared to mystery movies of today. I think Anthony Perkin's performance was the highlight of a movie full of highlights. It's a movie that has a simple story but adds complexity through the technical knowledge of Alfred Hitchcock. Incredible music, absolute tension, amazing plot, astonishing performances, extraordinary picture etc. And also this film had the best acting during the mid 1900's and is a favorite today. I really love musical movie nowadays since i watched those fantastic works.",Psycho
647,killer13,NOTHING SPECIAL DESPITE AN EXCELLENT PERFORMANCE BY ANTHONY PERKINS!,5,20 April 2000,Psycho**[2 Stars]- There is nothing good or bad about this movie. Its just an ok movie. The acting isn't great nor bad. But Anthony Perkins gives an excellent performance as Norman Bates and theres nothing great about any of the other actors. Also the shower scene is effective but it should have been longer. If you're a major Alfred Hitchock fan than I would recommend this movie to you but if not than skip this and go on to 'Psycho 2***[3 Stars]''.,Psycho
648,kristenwthomas,Artistic film with an unexpected ending,10,9 November 2020,"I loved the cinematography of ""Psycho"". There were so many unique shots like, the overhead of Norman arguing with his mother from the stairway of the house, the different angles of Norman in the parlor with his birds looming behind him, and the close up of him peering through the hole in the wall. The double exposure of Norman and his mother's skeletal face over his was also really artistic and shocking. I was really surprised at the ending, and it was a really satisfying end to all the build up of tension. The scene with Norman's (or rather his mother's) monologue at the end with the fly on his hand was really well done and creative.",Psycho
649,d-callaghan-46578,A great mystery film,6,23 April 2021,"I really enjoyed this film, the reason I didn't rate it higher is because of the slow start. However this slow start was necessary to the film, I was completely fooled into thinking Marion Crane was the main character only for her to be murdered soon after. This helped create the mystery aspect and always kept you guessing and there were a lot of twists.",Psycho
650,dwanehoyt_jrstaff,Classic!,10,16 December 2010,"Psycho, so much to be said about it but it can't possibly be described in words. An amazing American film that revolves around Marion Crane who isn't happy with her life at that current moment in time. The time she can spend with her boyfriend Sam is restricted by her working and his situation of having to pay alimony. One day her employer trusts her with $40,000 in cash, at this point in time she sees the perfect opportunity to take the money and run to meet Sam in California when, during a terrible storm, she has to pull over to stay the night at the Bates Motel. Peculiar things go on at the motel run by a man named Norman who seems to share an odd relationship with his mother.A really great film with amazing camera effects - the shower scene is infamous for many reasons one of which is how many camera takes are really in it. The photography of the film is outstanding and it shall remain a classic to be admired for it's production quality and the writing of the story itself.",Psycho
651,BenjaminBufordBlue,Hitchcock Materpiece,10,11 May 2011,"The story is great, the suspense is excellent, even the score and sounds are perfection. The acting and dialog are extremely realistic and intriguing. This is an absolute masterpiece by Hitchcock. I've seen many people criticize the first act of this movie for being too boring or unrelated to the rest of the film, but for me, it is actually my favorite part of the movie. Not only does it give some background on Marion and put the movie in motion, but it is incredibly well acted and technically sound. Some of the best interactions and dialog are in this first part, such as Marion and the police officer. The police officer is a dark and imposing figure who sees through Marion's acting and realizes something isn't right. Although he is very kind, professional, and concerned for Marion, Hitchcock is able to still make him seem like the bad guy, and builds suspense. Another great exchange is between Marion and the quirky car salesman, whose innocent lines seem to intimidate the paranoid Marion. Although it the salesman also seems to be concerned for Marion, and is nothing more than a quirky and playful in way, the audience feels uneasy due to what Marion is hiding and feeling.",Psycho
652,GoodBen,Psycho review,10,16 December 2011,"This movie was the first Alfred Hitchcock movie I had ever seen. It was very suspenseful and realistic. This movie has a very different style compared to today's horror films which is more about blood and gore rather than suspense and mystery. I thought Anthony Perkins did a wonderful job as Norman Bates. I liked how he could go from playing innocent character to a psychotic madman. I also like Janet Leigh's performance. I think it's too bad that they never released a colored version of this film.I think more horror movies today should try being more suspenseful and adding mystery rather than blood and gore, but with today's horror fans, I doubt that will ever happen. It seems that we've lost touch with suspenseful horror movies and just get into the blood and violence. Every now and then, we do see a horror movie with suspense and mystery, but it always seems to get outnumbered by the slasher movies.",Psycho
653,armycrazy,One of my favorite Hitchcock movies,10,28 March 2012,"I am personally a big fan of horror films, and I love a good mystery or two to go along with it. Psycho did an absolutely wonderful job of keeping me entertained, and the element of insanity or mental illness playing a role in the murders was a great key point of the film. The fact that even the killer doesn't know who he is adds a bigger feeling of mystery, and makes it more difficult for the viewer to find out who the killer is. I love trying to slowly piece together all the information that the movie gives you in order to try and figure out who the killer is, and Psycho did not dissappoint one bit. I would definitely watch this again.",Psycho
654,t-covino,Psycho,10,8 May 2013,One of the most classic horror films in history. It is a Hitchcock film in which a beautiful women finds what she thinks is a very nice proper man but is wrong. He was abused and dominated by his mother as a child which lead him to become the Psycho.Hitchcock plays the code very well and uses different shots and angles to show the horror of his film instead of directly showing the killings. A scene that is almost always mentioned when talking about horror films is in this film the epic shower scene. Which has seemed to be adopted by a lot of horror films after Psycho was made. The story itself is pretty intricate for a horror film and i really enjoyed watching it.,Psycho
655,RoseXGold,Wow,9,11 May 2013,"Okay, so I am obsessed with horror films. Even though this film is quite old and the effects are a bit dated. I would definitely have to say that this horror flick is way better than some out in theaters today! The music went well with the scenes. There were a great deal of lighting and contrasting used to create a sort of eerie feel. The plot was outrageous but not too far fetch. What made this film so great is that it is believable. All the incidents that happen in the film are things are not fantasy. The actors played their characters very well. Their words, feelings and emotions they portrayed felt authentic. The editing allowed for discontinuity during murder scenes, where certain images were a bit choppy. Overall , I give this film an A.",Psycho
656,xander34,Works because of the performances,7,29 October 2007,"Reviewing Alfred Hitchcock's famed black and white opus Psycho from a 21st century perspective gives the film less credit than it deserves. For it's time, it was revolutionary. Now, it is just a well acted, yet somewhat dated horror film. The editing in the shower scene has become a cliché in pop culture, but one cannot deny the original brilliance of the scene. The movie really only works as well as it does because of the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Perkins never really had another role he was better in, save Mike Nichols' Catch-22, a personal favorite. After Hitchcock died, he later starred and directed in numerous Psycho sequels before Perkins' eventual death. Hitchcock's killing of Leigh at the onset is also quite ground-breaking. It was mirrored in Wes Craven's Scream with the Drew Barrymore character, as well as in many other pictures.Psycho also created the character of Dr. Sam Loomis, a name later used in the other revolutionary horror film, John Carpenter's Halloween. Overall, the movie doesn't age as horrible as some other select black and white 50's-60's horror films, but nevertheless it does age a reasonable amount, leading to many cringe worthy and laughable scenes, most likely due lackluster performances by the rest of the cast, low production values, and shady effects and ""skeletons.""",Psycho
657,getchinator189,Classic horror movie,8,28 August 2019,"I feel as though horror movies today are more slasher films then actual horror movies like the works of Alfred Hitchcock's psycho. Watched it, enjoyed it and I feel spoiled by today's horror genre... this feels kinda flat. But looking at it for what it is... suspenseful and creepy! It's a masterpiece of that era, not in the modern era sadly! Alfred Hitchcock in my opinion, is like Steven Spielberg of horror films because he started a trend and change in the genre! I would recommend it as a neat looking back at how movies use to be done!",Psycho
658,cjlance8,Psycho Review,10,12 May 2015,Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock was an amazing thriller movie. Hitchcock kept you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole movie. This movie is flawless and the cinematography is perfect. Using the shadows and covering up the killer in the shower scene was perfect. It couldn't get any better. The shower scene is one of the best scenes I've ever seen in any movie. The camera zooms in as she showering to the shadowy figure in the background. Then he opens the curtain and the score music comes on which was perfect and fit so well. While he is stabbing her his whole figure is still hidden and you can't see his face. Then he leaves the bathroom as she's dying and the camera is just focused on her hand as she is slowly dying. It was perfect and just gave me that weird feeling. I loved it. That scene describes a horror movie perfectly. The acting job too during that scene was great. She made it look so realistic and it was spectacular.,Psycho
659,Mikheil-H,So much more than that shower scene!!,9,17 March 2021,"Despite being 60 years old, Psycho holds up remarkably well. This is thanks to a wholly unique soundtrack that, whilst simple in nature, maintains tension throughout the film.Despite knowing the infamous shower scene and the shocking twist ending which the film is known for, I was pleased to know there was so much more to enjoy with Psycho.To my surprise, Bates Motel doesn't feature until approximately 30 minutes into the film, yet by then, the viewer has become enthralled in the supposed beginning of a cat and mouse chase with Janet Leigh's Marion stealing $40,000 and about to be hunted by her sister, employer, lover and police (er). As such, it is clear to see why the murder in the shower is as iconic as it is. It shatters any preconceived notion for where a first-time viewer would think the story is going. It shifts the protagonist from the innocent yet determined Marion, to Anthony Perkins' consistently panicked motel manager with extreme parental issues.On top of the music, Hitchcock's makes the scenery so vivid you nearly forget it's all in black and white. Furthermore, the dialogue is flawless, with a final line that could rival Silence of the Lambs for being spine chilling in its potential repercussions. The definition of classic!",Psycho
660,k-spain,Great Movie,8,16 December 2015,"If you only ever see one Alfred Hitcock movie in your lifetime, make it Psycho. This film has the perfect elements that every horror films has. What makes this movie more scary is that it is something that could potentially happen in real life. The most famous scene in the movie, the shower scene, is just as good in the film as it is in every promo it has ever been in. The montage that Hitchcock created is truly iconic. I truly admire that fact that Hitchcock also puts little bits of ridiculousness into the film, so that the audience does not get too scared, and it reminds them that it is just a movie. This movie inspired spin-off TV series', and has appeared in countless places, and now I understand why. Truly a great film.",Psycho
661,t-murphy-94619,Thrilling and chilling,8,17 December 2015,"Psycho is one of the best thriller movies. It deserves its iconic place in movies history. Everything in this movies feels creepy. The lighting is foreboding. The strange camera angles give a sense of foreboding. The performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is what ties this film together. Bates' strange naivety yet obsessive personality is shown through his facial expressions alone. The way the tone of his voice changes when sensitive topics come up has a subtle brilliance. The film does have a few immersion breaking moments. The long overly long fall down the stairs, meant to increase suspense, instead reminds the viewer they are in fact just watching a movie. The quick explanation scene at the end breaks the mood as well. However, the film still thrills perfectly except for a very few short instances.",Psycho
662,smcguirk-88356,Alfred Hitchhock at his Finest,9,18 April 2016,"This movie really shows why Alfred Hitchcock is known to be the best filmmaker of suspense and thrilling movies. The suspense shown throughout the movie and especially during the famous scene when Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) was murdered in a shower, this scene exemplified the suspense that was present throughout the entire movie. The highlight of the film is the acting done by Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates). He really becomes the character from the facial tics. Many people prefer the original movie from 1960 than the remake from 1998 and I think this has a lot to do with Anthony Perkins. Overall this is in my top 10 horror movies.",Psycho

Only from Sir Alfred Hitchcock, of course. And this one is one of the best.",Psycho
664,jsteiger,The best horror film ever -- by a wide margin,10,14 August 2003,"Psycho still holds up as brilliant entertainment more than 40 years after its release. So great is the film's influence on modern cinema that this fact is, in itself, amazing. Psycho broke cinematic ground in many areas, and immediately spawned countless imitators (William Castle's ""Homicidal"" comes immediately to mind.)First, consider the elements of the film's success. A razor sharp script. One of the 5 best musical scores in the history of film. One of the best acting performances (and certainly the most underrated) in film history by Anthony Perkins. Near perfect black and white photography. All these things fit together so seamlessly that it is easy to overlook them.Second, consider (and it is difficult for modern viewers, since so much of Psycho has been imitated to the point of becoming a cliche) the ways the film broke new ground.  (WARNING -- SPOILERS FOLLOW)a. It killed a central character, in a completely shocking and surprising way, halfway through the film. It killed a female character! It killed a *sympathetic female* character!!  These things *just weren't done* in a film before then. Let me tell you, I watched the film, at the age of 16, on the big screen. After the shower room scene, people were in a state of complete shock. My mother, who sat next to me, had dug her fingernails about a quarter inch into my forearm. The man sitting in front of me had an asthma attack. The impact of Psycho on film audiences was so powerful it is really difficult to imagine.b. It completely succeeded in fooling the audience with a major twist.Let me assure you. Virtually NO ONE who watched Psycho had ANY IDEA Norman Bates was the killer until the final scenes. The killer with a split personality has now become a tired cliche in cinema, but at the time it was revolutionary. EVERYONE thought the killer was this crazed woman we hadn't seen yet. Every one of my friends and all the adults in my neighborhood saw Psycho. Everyone admitted, laughingly, that they had been completely fooled.c. It actually created a phobia for many of its viewers!For me, and for many other people, Psycho actually created a phobia. For years after watching it, many people actually felt creeping fear every time they drew a shower curtain shut. For the master of suspense, there could be no higher tribute.I cringe when I see people call Psycho ""overrated"" or wonder aloud ""why it wasn't shot in color.""  Good grief!To understand the true genius of the film, you had to be alive at the time and watch it on the big screen. But please, please go back and watch one scene -- the ""sandwich dinner"" and ensuing conversation between Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Watch this scene, and all it manages to convey, then watch the identical scene played, in color, by two pretty good actors (Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche in the dreadful 1998 remake. Vaughn knows what he's up against, and can't begin to come close to Perkins. The question is, could any actor in the history of film play this scene as well?That one scene, in my opinion, should put Tony Perkins in the acting hall of fame, and should have won him an Academy Award. But in those days, horror films were automatically ruled out.",Psycho

666,simranpersaud,psycho movie review,9,4 November 2020,This film tested a lot of different areas and broke some boundaries in terms of what was in the movie itself. It was a very popular movie and still is a good movie to watch. The film has a combination of violence and sexual explicitness which was a reason why this was a popular movie back in 1960. The most iconic scene in the movie was the shower scene and the first time I saw the movie I could see why. Even though the scene wasn't as realistic it was still very violent and gory for that time period. It was in a sense a introduction to the psychological thriller and gory movies that we have now.,Psycho

This Hitchcock classic doesn't disappoint, from the artistic camera angles to the great use of lighting, it gave the movie a unique texture that made it just more unsettling. Hitchcock did a terrific job directing the suspense throughout the movie which was aided by the strategic placement of the soundtrack. Another great aspect of this film was how good of a job each of the actors did. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, was painfully awkward and it made certain scenes so much more uncomfortable to watch.

Psycho is about Marion Crane after she steals 40,000 dollars from her employer and plans to run away with her boyfriend. However, after driving through the back roads on a stormy night, she decides to stop at the Bates Motel where she meets the proprietor of the motel Norman Bates. This movie is a real horror classic that is still studied in film classes around the United States to this day. I personally like this movie and the creepy atmosphere that it gives off, it makes it feel like Marion is stuck at this motel with someone that she can't exactly trust.

This movie is for sure a must watch! I absolutely love movies like this, and most of the time these days, horror movies are not even scary.This movie is about a woman named Marion Crane. She is in love with a man who was recently divorced, his name is Sam Loomis. He wants to marry Marion but says he won't until he pays off the money he still owes his ex-wife. Marion was asked by her boss only a bit later if she would put one of their client's money in the bank. Marion agreed and took the money which was 40,000 dollars. Instead of bringing it to the bank, she decided to take it and run away from the city. During her run away there are scenes of course that make it feel as if she is about to be caught, but lucky enough for her she wasn't... or maybe she would've been in a better situation if she was caught?After getting away from the cops she ends up at the Bates Hotel. This is where she meets the owner whose name is Norman Bates. He ended up offering Marion to dinner, in which she accepted of course. She later went to her room where she took a shower. As she was in the shower she suddenly saw a shadow and was brutally murdered by Norman. The end is crazy in this movie and really leaves you at the end of ur chair!",Psycho
670,jamesfalace,One of Hitchcock's finest pieces of work,10,10 December 2020,"Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most extraordinary directors/brings in all of Hollywood. The way he portrays stories and scenes are spectacular. Psycho is no exception as it is a huge success in the 60s and beyond. Psycho is a very mysterious horror film that follows a couple going to a motel, the couple meet the man who owns it with his mother who lives in the house on the hill behind. Throughout the movie the use of close ups, establishing shots, zoom in shots, low key lighting, low angle shots, and the tremendous acting does a great job shaping this movie. The twist in the end is by far one of the best ever seen I'd written. The use of sound especially when Bates is searching for the woman is nerve wrecking as you hear the violin strings increasing each moment. The over the shoulder shot when the woman finds the truth about the mother creates a shocking moment and reveals the dark twisted secret that lives within Norman Bates. Overall this film is such a good example on how movies are developing into masterpieces with the mind of the creator. Hats off to Hitchcock on this one",Psycho
671,c-hendron,Psycho (1960),10,16 November 2020,"In Psycho, Hitchcock shows off that he can master the feeling of suspense in his films. There's very few moments while watching this film that you don't feel a slight chill running down your spine. While it doesn't have the over-the-top horror aspects of todays films, it actually has one of my favorite jump scares of all time. The scene where Arbogast reaches the top of the stairs and all you see is a figure swiftly come out of the bedroom and stab him, made my skin crawl the very first time I saw it. The sound design and soundtrack are utilized so artfully in making the film as suspenseful and thrilling as it is. You can't mention this film without mentioning the iconic ""shower scene"" which is just a masterclass in filmmaking. The use of cuts, a cut for every slash of the knife, and not a single one containing an actual mark on Janet Leigh's body. The constant cut of the camera and jump to blood running down the drain lets your brain piece it all together without showing almost a single thing. It's things like this that show off just how amazing Hitchcock films are, and why this film is such a smart horror. If you love horror, this film needs to be on your watch list.",Psycho

Anthony Perkins smashed it as Norman Bates and became 'One of the Scariest Villains who Ever graced the Cinema'. Alfred Hitchcock did the best in every aspect to make this movie, one of the Greatest.A movie that transcends the limits of time and became Immortal for fans, critics and the upcoming film makers.

674,hoorayformikereed,The Best Horror Movie Ever Made,10,5 November 2002,"Nobody was ever as good as Hitchcock. Nobody. And Hitch gets to show off the full scope of his directing talents with Psycho, his 1960 masterpiece of terror, suspense, drama and mystery. Drawing the audience in from the first scene, seriously screwing with their minds, then throwing them back out again, the Master of Suspense more than lives up to his prestigious title.In a classic bit of directorial finesse, Hitchcock throws the audience for one of the biggest loops in movie history 50 minutes into the movie. Until then, the film has focused on Janet Leigh's character and the money-stealing plot. Who knew she would die so suddenly? From there the movie goes on to focus on the likable yet obviously troubled Norman Bates and his somewhat suspicious relationship with his mysterious mother.Toying with our emotions like no one else could, Hitch forces us to root for Norman through the rest of the movie, even to a subconcious degree. We know that Norman is covering up a murder, but, admit it, when that car was sinking in the swamp and it stopped, you wanted it to go all the way down just as much as Norman, didn't you? Taken on an intellectual standpoint, this movie can make you question your morals, beliefs, and ethics. Or you can just relax and let it scare the hell out of you. Both ways are equally effective.Words like ""thrilling,"" and ""disturbing"" are thrown around a lot these days. However, this movie inarguably sets the standard by which ""thrilling"" and ""disturbing"" movies will forever be measured. It's a classic of filmmaking, and you cannot rightfully call yourself a movie buff until you have seen it. Be forewarned though - it may make you swear off showers for a lifetime.(****/****)",Psycho
675,k-cronin,Classic Goody!,10,2 December 2009,"AMAZING!!!! Hitchcock was such an artist. He had an amazing way of making a character pop out in each in their own way. The viewer could feel the actors emotions through the film. That is not only great acting, that is good directing as well. The picture and directing were wonderful in so many ways. Each frame in the film was so intense and beautifully lit up. The high-key and low key lighting throughout the whole movie was perfect. Hitchcock knew just how to light up a scene then quickly make it dark and dim for just the right element of three key lighting. He made it look easy. An example is the back lighting he would use whenever the film showed the house normal bates (Anthony Perkins) lived in with his mother. The house looked scary and evil. Hitchcock payed attention to every detail in all of his films. For a film directed in 1960 is still gave me the creeps. Going into this movie i had assumed that it was going to be similar to the movie in 1998, but it was totally different. I loved this one much more.",Psycho
676,tsheridan94,The movie that redefined a genre,7,8 February 2010,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was the movie that revolutionized horror forever. This is a must-see for anyone who calls themselves a connoisseur of horror. And while not the scariest film ever, or even in the top tier, it still provides a marvelous psychological aspect, and some genuinely terrifying moments. Psycho also has one of the most famous horror sequences, and even movie scenes in general. Is there anyone who hasn't heard of the shower scene? This scene is famous for a reason. The eclectic shots, switching so frequently that it almost looks like still frames create an atmosphere of realism. This seems like a newscast, a real event. And that's what is so scary about this movie. It seems completely real, as if these events could happen. Hitchcock caters to the imagination, his brand of fear rooted in emotion, not visuals.Hitchcock's classic black and white tale of passion and horror was revolutionary for the time, and consequently has spawned a slew of imitators. None of these emit the intensity so easily shown in Hitchcock's Psycho. There has even been a remake, a travesty to the original. In the spirit of honor, the 1998 film with Vince Vaughn should change it's name so it won't be associated with this 1960 gem.Hitchcock was, and actually still is, a force to be reckoned with in this league. He is a force of nature. New horror movies come and go, and, aside from a very select few, are forgotten in a matter of months. Hitchcock as shown his staying power in the dog eat dog world of horror by creating not one, or two, but countless classics. The greatest of these, though, was unquestionably his little came changer called Psycho.",Psycho
677,zthaleb,loved this film,9,10 May 2013,"This movie is a great horror movie! I was hiding behind my blanket the entire time and I loved every second of it. I am so glad that I finally had the courage to watch it. The storyline is great and totally unexpected. I always heard people talking about this movie saying how amazing it was and how it was a classic slasher film, so going into it I thought it was a typical slasher film. Little did I know there was a twist at the end, the name Psycho really suits the movie. Bates who is played by Anthony Perkins is the perfect ""psycho"", he played crazy so well. The dark sharp music definitely added to how scared I was! As much as I hate being scared, I loved this movie!",Psycho
678,m-visker,Psycho 1960,9,5 May 2014,"Psycho is a one of a kind, the fact that there is even a remake of this movie is comical, and the remake compared to the original is laughable. Hitchcock's Psycho is intriguing and suspenseful, however I wouldn't personally call Psycho a scary movie, but it definitely leaves you with an uneasy feeling by the end of the movie. Hitchcock is known for many things, one being his use of McGuffins. A McGuffin is when a movie has an item or piece of information that seems to be important to the story but really has no meaning, it is used for suspense. In Psycho the McGuffin would definitely be the envelope of money, in the start we believe that the whole movie is going to surround Marion Crane and how she will get away with the stolen money. But Hitchcock then throws us off track when our main lead is killed within the first 30 minutes of the movie. I liked this aspect of the movie; I found it interesting to spend so much time on the plot only to completely change it, something I personally have never experienced before. Of course many people know the famous shower scene in Psycho, when Marion Crane is murdered. This scene is used as a great example of the use of quick shots, being that this short scene has so many shots, and the shots themselves are so strategically framed. Not once is there any nudity or gore, never do we see the knife cut Marion, but instead we are almost forced to visualize the violence in our own heads, filling in the blank. Psycho is a classic Hitchcockian film; it really shows and illustrates his style and like most of his movies, is very entertaining.",Psycho
679,Bcrosier1674,Hitchcock At His Best,10,8 May 2014,"Alfred Hitchcock delivered a masterpiece with Psycho. The mystique surrounding the film has become almost legendary, if only for the ultimate plot twist at the end of the film. Anthony Perkins, as the one and only Norman Bates, gives an incredible performance of an unfortunately troubled young man, and makes you feel truly sorry for he has endured in his life. Of course, the shower scene has to be addressed, but the music and the events are two special entities. The music, however, is what I feel gives an extra sense of suspense to the already startling moment. This film proves that Alfred Hitchcock was truly an innovator in directing films, and has left behind a legacy that will maybe never be approached again.",Psycho
680,connorsalisbury18,Culturally Significant and Excellent.,9,6 May 2014,"The film Psycho directed by Alfred Hitchcock is teeming with character and an interesting plot line. The film is culturally significant as it portrayed a villain that was not one dimensional but rather detailed. The ending scene where Norman Bates, while dressed up as his mother stabs Marion is iconic. This scene along with the classic music and sound that went along with it is unforgettable. The concept of Psycho has even been re imagined as a television series, since it remains so popular even today. The movie had great acting, and Norman Bates character made the film. He was eccentric and crazy, talking to his dead mother, and even 'becoming' her at times. The setting was ominous and creepy. There was this empty motel with this looming mansion above it on a hill. It emanated spookiness, and added to the mise-en-scene of the film. The movie gave a great feeling of intrusion, and the lack of privacy which made the movie scary and unsettling. Overall the film was an excellent piece of psychological horror that still resonates with fans today.",Psycho
681,JudgeChaos,The Internet Ruins Everything,8,7 May 2015,"There's a shower in this movie...even if you haven't seen Psycho you know this. I really wish people continued to follow Alfred Hitchcock's request to not talk about this movie after you see it. I found the first half boring because everyone knows about the infamous shower! But after that...it got scarier because I didn't know anything post-shower. Okay I knew about Norman's mother but that's beside the point! This movie did manage to creep me out, especially the last shot. If there's one thing I love about this movie, it has to be the music. The music plays your nerves like a fiddle, and it is fantastic. Even Hitchcock himself said the music makes this movie. If you're looking for a suspenseful thriller, then stop by the Bates Motel and stay a while...speaking of the Bates Motel, I haven't seen that show yet, but I hear it's good.",Psycho
682,nhudak-99559,The most memorable horror film of all time.,9,16 December 2015,"Alfred Hitchcock astounds me as to how well he is able to deliver horror in such a way that to the modern day viewer can still send shivers down your spine. With psycho there is more to the horror then simply jump scares. There's suspense and anxiety that the audience feels while watching this because they see what is going to happen with the characters in the film yet they don't. What did bother me however was some of the cheesy scenes in the film that I just couldn't help but to laugh as. Such as, where the murderer kills one of his victims at the top of a star case then he proceeds to fall down them. Its clearly obvious that he is standing in front of a screen and he is standing up flailing his arms around and being over dramatic. Other than that I couldn't find anything wrong with the film. For this being considered Hitchcock's best movie you need to do yourself a service and go check it out.",Psycho

Psycho is a very complicated story, and I also can say that it's too good.I really haven't understood who the psychopath or a lead character is as the story continues because some characters on it are extraordinary. The strangely real story makes us feel all the more scared although it's supposed to be fiction.Furthermore, the weird sound of the violin can set off restlessness and fear among us. The sound is actually used by some horror games as far as I know. Also, you'll be reluctant to take a shower alone for a few days after watching it.",Psycho
684,Tremor,Simply The Best!,10,30 December 1998,"What more can be said about ""PSYCHO"",Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic that spawned an entire genre...the slasher film. To prove that this masterpiece truly stands the test of time,I recommended it to two of the 7th grade students that I teach (who have been subjected to the whole ""Halloween-Friday The 13th-Nightmare On Elm Street-Scream"" recycling bin)...and they loved it! The black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous,and the legendary musical score by Bernard Herrmann has never been matched (with John Carpenter's creepy ""Halloween"" score as a worthy runner-up). The 1998 remake is a pointless,cheap,waste of time (as it wastes the enormous,combined talents of Vince Vaughn,Anne Heche,Julianne Moore,William H.Macy,Philip Baker Hall and Robert Forster). As a movie buff and horror film addict,I cannot recommend ""PSYCHO"" enough...it is the definitive slasher film,and in my opinion,the best horror film ever! I'm not going to waste any time summarizing the now-familiar plot. Let's just say that no one twitched like the late,great Anthony Perkins,and the only actress to match Janet Leigh's shower scream is her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis of ""Halloween"" fame. **** A+ (10/10)",Psycho

686,cwangz,I can see why it was so groundbreaking!,10,9 April 2021,"All I can say is that I could not keep my eyes off of this movie! Hitchcock pulled out all stops for his masterpiece. There was theft, lying, provocativeness with a female character, murder, and psychological trauma for everyone involved, both characters and viewers alike. What was most captivating about the whole film, however, would have to be Alfred Hitchcock's use of close up shots which showed the true fear and anxiousness within each character of the film.",Psycho

Everything about this film was intriguing, mysterious, and kept you on edge. Lighting and shadows were pushed further than I've seen in a film so far. A memorable and iconic film has to do with either the ending, the score, or a specific scene. Psycho takes the cake and checks off all three boxes multiple times. The actors delivered their roles and made you feel like you never truly knew what was going on, which added to the suspense. The ending totally threw me off guard, and made me rethink the whole plot. It's important to note how well the script was written, because it makes the ending that much better. Overall, this was a film of genius and really had you tearing your mind apart trying to piece happenings together. Nothing will prepare you for the ending!",Psycho

The acting is great, story is great, Hitchcock is really a legend when it comes to these kinds of films. The cinematography was good; I thought there were some nice shots like pans, zooming in and zooming out shots, I thought they were done well. Anthony Perkins who played Norman Bates is great; he has great facial acting and he sold the idea that his character was off from the very beginning. The music queues were really good too. During some of the scenes that are meant to be scary or suspenseful, we hear that high pitch violin to really give the full effect of suspension. I give this film an 8 out of 10 because it's such a classic.",Psycho
689,aeiyok,Week 11 IMDb Psycho,10,7 April 2021,"The initial focus of psycho was around Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). We first meet her on. Her lunch break talking with her love interest Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Soon after she goes back to work she's given a money by her boss to give to the bank. $40,000. After she receives this money she goes on the run. While she's on the it starts raining very hard along with the thought of what's going on at home she decides to check into a motel. This where she meets Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). After an awkward interaction Normans mother (Norman) kills Marion. By this time her disappearance has been primary talk of Sam and Marions sister Lila Crane (Vera Miles). Lila and sam worries lead them to hire a private investigator Detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam). Arbogast did his investigation and had found himself in at the bates motel. As he investigated he went into the actual bates house Norman kills him. Finally Sam and Lila go down to the Bates Motel. As they go they take a more calculated approach to see what's actually going on. As Sam distracts Norman, Lila finds out that Normans mom is not alive. During this time Norman knocked Sam out and is blitzed Lila but, Sam comes to just in time to subdue Norman. Normans mother side of his split personality takes over as he's arrested.Psycho is one of the greatest horror films ever made. All of the aspects are executed perfectly. The music whenever a killing or something bad is supposed to happen doesn't make this movie predictable. It creates the tense feeling its supposed to. Norman Bates as a personality was just so off-putting an amazing antagonist for this movie. The mystery hidden in with if Normans mother is alive or not added to the story. The end with Norman's mother taking over his whole mind after the explanation is the cherry on top. The way the movie turned from an easy going movie to a dark murder mystery so fast added to the complete perfection of this horror film.",Psycho
690,chasingllamas,Much-too-human monsters,10,14 December 2009,"Alfred Hitchcock has been considered a master of suspense and an artist of anxiety. In 1960 Hitchcock directed one on the most famous movies of all time, Psycho. Psycho starred Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin. This film helped set the stage for future horror movies.In the beginning of this film, office worker Marion packs her bags and drives off with $40,000 worth of stolen cash. She stops at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman and learns of his controlling mother. Marion is stabbed to death later that night in the shower by what looks like an old woman. This shower scene was famous ever since. The use of believability and artificiality makes Hitchcock stand out because most horror movies at the time were clearly fiction. Throughout the entire film there is something going on that the audience hasn't got completely figured out. It builds up to something big and in the end it's not what the audience expected at all! Hitchcock has perfected his style of creating what is least likely to be expected.

But nothing shocks like the seeing it for yourself. Psycho is the one of best horror film ever made, and I usually hate this movies. The story is incredible and so is everything else. The shower scene was so important because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a naked chick getting stabbed in a shower was something that nobody had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing people having sex and getting hatched to death is nothing uncommon. The soundtrack is so important in this film. Sound is such an important element in movies.

But it seemed to be a bit boring. Now I'm not saying its not great, but for a suspenseful movie it was boring. But it is a movie from the 60s so it is still pretty amazing for being a classic. Plus the acting is great and Anthony Perkins does an amazing job presenting himself , he is just chilling to the bone. All critique aside, I love this film. In particular, the shower scene. It is easily one of the most chilling horror scenes of all time, and I'm sure audiences who first viewed it were floored. It is so effective because the viewer never sees the knife actually penetrating the victim's skin. Its all left to your imagination.",Psycho

The movie overall was great it had all the elements of a great thriller you didn't know who the real killer was until you got close to the end of the film. The plot was great the way the story unfolded was another strong point in the movie. The actors played their roles really well especially the killer his character was great because he was just nervous a the time but got defensive in an instant whenever his mother is involved which kept it really entertaining given the fact that you don't see the mother you only hear her.

695,l-seidel,Not my favorite Hitchcock,7,7 May 2014,"This one was really hurt for me by knowing all of the twists and turns. While a lot of Hitchcock films can stand up even with knowing what happens, I don't think this one does. It's such a pure horror film, there to shock and disturb. If you know where it's going, how can you be shocked? I also wasn't overly thrilled with the concept of a boy who loves his mom that much. I get that was part of what was unsettling for the viewer, but it unsettled me past the point of enjoyment.That being said, I really loved the use of location. It's a film that stays in mostly one place, and yet never feels stale. Hitchcock did a brilliant job turning that motel into something to be feared. The actors also did a fantastic job projecting the sense that something was just slightly off, a feeling that built the farther into the film you got.I can only wonder how I would have felt about this film had the penultimate shower sequence and reveal of the mother not been so ingrained in my memory.",Psycho

I'm not sure), but it's great without it. This movie does such a great job at leading you on, and just smiling at you once you hit a dead in (such as when you think the girl is the first protagonist, when she's really not). The plot twist at the end was certainly uncalled for, and I enjoyed that a lot. The movie tries to make you connect towards some of the characters, mostly with the son, and I almost went with it. Almost. My favorite scene, probably along with most other people, was the shower scene. Very well done, and I loved the movement, the expression, the sound, it was all working.

Fate catches up to her at the bates motel where she is murdered. After the death of the main character so early on in the film, her boyfriend and sister come looking for her, hoping to solve the mystery of her disappearance. By doing so, we are brought into the mind of a psychopath.This film, like Hitchcock's other films ,are extremely suspenseful and fun.

Int the beginning of the movie, her underwear was black. After she decided to give back the money h had stolen, her underwear is white to symbolize her repenting her crimes. Overall the movie is very good. My favorite part of the whole movie is Anthony Perkins' acting. It's excellently creepy which s good to set up an overall feel for the infamous Bates Motel.

It demands you study the camera angles, facial expressions, background of the scenes, clothes, paintings on the walls, etc.  Simply put:  the movie is a masterpiece.  I get so wrapped up into the movie that I forget that it's forty years later and the actors/actresses in this flick are now all old, or dead.  Anthony Perkins, the man who plays the mysterious Norman Bates who struggles with the love of his mother, died in the 1990s.  Anthony Perkins shows the talent of an actor that is second to none.  His performance is brilliant.Vera Miles reminds me of the nosey best-friend that each one of us has. She's not a totally lovable person but her character shows that deep down, she is a caring person.  She has more guts than me when she goes to the house to visit Norman's mother.John Gavin's role would be the role that most of the men watching the movie could relate to the most.  He appears as a clean-cut man who just so happens is having an affair.  He plays the character of Sam. John Gavin, the actor, is complicated, however.  You will understand when you watch the movie.  He really doesn't speak a lot but his body language is excellent.  I would love to know more about Mr. John Gavin but there's very little information about him on the internet.Patricia Hitchcock is the director's daughter.  She plays the role of an office worker.  Her acting is totally believable and I found myself watching the scene in which she appears over and over.Alfred Hitchcock's famous movie Psycho is my favorite-all-time movie and every time I watch it, I see something else in a scene that I did not see before.Lastly, Janet Leigh plays the woman who checks into Bates' Motel  and it's a visit which the viewer will never forget.I love this movie so much that I wish it were possible for me to shake the hand of every actor and actress who starred in this classic tale.  Once you see the movie I think you will agree.The camera men deserves a special pat on the back for their fine work.",Psycho

This one, however, is at the top of the food chain.  Psycho is brilliant.  Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was superb.  Especially Anthony Perkins playing the role of Norman Bates.  He always talked so fast, like he was nervous and anxious all the time.  When he talked to Marion Crane about his mother, it gave me chills down my spine.  ""She just...she just goes a little mad sometimes.  We all go a little mad sometimes.""  At that era, I don't think a better person could have delivered that line than Anthony Perkins.  What makes this movie so great is its originality.  Sure, there have been lots of films about ""psychos,"" but this is pretty much the first one.  The script was excellent, the acting was excellent, the direction was excellent, the cinematography was excellent, the music was excellent, the scenery was incredible, especially that dark old house where ""Mother"" lived.  I could just go on and on about what a great movie this is.  My grade: A+",Psycho
705,Travis69,Psycho review,10,22 October 2003,"Scream all you want, Psycho is the greatest horror flick of all time. Much of the praise is due to three ingenious elements directed by the great auteur Alfred Hitchcock: camerawork, editing, and sounds. Cleverly, our sympathy for first-half protagonist, Marian Crane (the beautiful Janet Leigh-mother of Jamie Lee Curtis), shifts towards a creepy commiseration for antagonist (?), Norman Bates. Both characters are indeed psychotic, though on different levels. We feel for Crane, knowing that her misdeed-scamming her boss out of $40,000-is wrong; and we're just as sure to be annoyed when an ominously curious state policeman tracks behind. Indeed, several could relate to Marian Crane, having had the feeling of splitting from the real world and all its dilemmas before, or merely Arizona, in her case. Crane's destination is Los Angeles, assumingly comparative to the numerous venturing for more glory and escapism. On her way she decides to spend a night at an off-road dive; it's raining hard and who needs more with another pesky trooper? Rather than using the typical fat, old, balding loner from the Psycho novel, Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano employ a relatively more normal, attractive personality to exemplify the Bates Motel manager. With that, Anthony Perkins sets off one of film's greatest performances. For much of the second half, mama's boy Bates becomes the character we are more concerned about.The cinematography in Psycho is as creepy as the plot. Shot in black and white, not because Hitchcock had to, but because he wanted to, our two main characters are followed in medium shot thoroughly at every step. Every reaction is recorded to its highest definition, from Bates searing eyeball scheming on his guest's undergarment, to Crane's multiple changes of expression when the pursuing officer veers right. Psycho is a non-stop showcase of vigorous zooming and follow-framing. What makes this formalist approach to film-making so great is its unconventionality. Alfred Hitchcock was keen on every detail, providing a window for viewers to snatch every bit. Hitchcock also provided psychological clues to the story in his score, perhaps one of the top three to five greatest ever composed (even Busta Rhymes wanted to `Gimme Some More'). The screeching violin play chillingly reflects the screeching sounds of birds, symbolism often found throughout Psycho. Even the sudden clash of windshield wipers during Crane's stormy drive to Los Angeles is a conceivable preview to what lay ahead.Perhaps nothing is more impressive, however, than the editing. Oftentimes the first thing mentioned about Psycho is the notorious `shower scene.' Aside from changing the entire landscape of the film, from a quickly-paced protagonist goal to a slower-moving character study, the scene contains a barrage of amazing edits. In this horrific slashing scene, we miss nudity and contact-gore if you will-yet, to much of our delight. The pacing of this classic montage is more attractive, in essence, because of its unpredictability. And with Hitchcock, why expect nothing else?

While the film itself was enjoyable, much of the camera shots caught my eye, and eyes of many viewers. Many of these scenes appeal to the subconscious of the viewer. While its difficult to discuss the concept of these camera shots without spoiling the film, windows, backdrops, mirrors, lighting and other tools are used to create suspense, foreshadowing, imagery, etc. Using lower angles allowed for the characters to be seen in a menacing position.

The tension was on and off, and every time it felt like it was about to break, they would switch to a calmer scene, and then switch back to the tense one. The constant change made the movie exciting to watch. Another thing I noticed were that almost every character felt like a REAL character. Most of the characters had lines or at least some interaction with the film. It kept pace until a smooth end with all the loose ends tied up. I though this movie really displayed Hitchcocks abilities both in suspense and in cinematography.",Psycho
709,k-boughton,A timeless horror classic,10,20 April 2021,"Psycho is a horror film that defined the genre and to this day is a film that stands the test of time. Norman Bates is a character that is originally shown as a good man who cares for his mother and to the outside world that's all he was. Although deep down he was mentally ill and had brutally murdered multiple people and kept the body of his mother in his basement, taking on her identity as part of his mental illness. On the other hand when the viewer meets Marion Crane she is seen as a woman in a hotel room with a man and stealing money from her boss. The viewer sees her as the criminal but really she was a good person who made a mistake that she was prepared to make right. Psycho does a great job at examining the human psyche while giving the viewer a look into the the thoughts of the main characters and to see the world through their eyes for a moment.Psycho is a movie unlike any other and I think something that I appreciate is although this film is a horror film also brought mental illness to mainstream media by explaining why he did the things he did at the end of the film.",Psycho
710,paleowildchild,Good movie,5,21 April 2021,"Psycho was an intricate and complicated movie with many plot twists. You start out thinking that the film is about theft and then murder.From a plot perspective, the film keeps you on the edge of your seat. However, by the middle of the movie, you can make an educated guess as to what is actually going on. This took away from the overall effect of the movie. It was also done in black and white even tho color was a possibility. Perhaps this was to make the movie a bit more creepy?As for the acting, it was not very good. The shower scene and the truth about mother's sene were particularly bad. Both were terribly drawn out, and the expressions on their faces were, well, it was as if they were just told to hang their mouths open and claw at the air.",Psycho
711,AlexCWM,Almost Perfect,9,14 April 2021,"Psycho is a masterful execution in the horror genre. From the beginning, Psycho gives the viewer a sense of unease. The movie's pacing is perfect, opening with the story of a woman on the run before becoming a sinister descent into madness. The movie is very grounded in reality, making it all the scarier. I really loved this film, and as a new viewer of old movies, it definitely shocked me how much it had to offer. The one complaint I have is that the film seems to contribute to negative stereotypes of the neurodivergent and transgender communities. The killer comes with a stereotypical case of dissociative identity disorder, reinforcing the idea that everyone with DID is to be feared. However, we need to remember that this movie is a product of its time. One may argue that to view it through a modern lens would be unfair.",Psycho
712,CriticalCondition,An Innovative thriller,10,11 May 2011,"Psycho is one of the best horror films, if not one of the best films of all-time. This film became Alfred Hitchcock's signature films and one of the most innovative film of its time. Psycho is not only innovative because of the Hitchcock's mastery of tense moments, cutting between music and silence. But also because Psycho was the first movie to kill off the main actress in the very beginning. Janet Leigh is the star of the film and is killed off almost immediately. This was innovative at that time, because most film goers would show up 10 to 15 minutes late to films. So when these late movie goers arrived, they were shocked to see they missed the big murder seen featuring the starlet. From this time on, people would begin to arrive on time so that they wouldn't miss anything.This film is well made, scare, and iconic. It is a must see for everyone!",Psycho
713,Piratezombie7,Hitchcock knows best,10,14 December 2011,Growing up I knew Psycho references way before I had even seen the movie. The infamy which this movie has earned is totally understandable because of how awesome it is. The storyline is one of my favorite of all suspense movies. Even though there is a lack of violence and gore in the movie it still acts as one of the best horror/suspense movie to date. The acting by the lead man is what i often reference if I am looking for a creepy model to base my acting off of. Hitchcock used a lack of gimmicks and effects in all of his movies but in Psycho the simplicity really adds to the creepiness and really makes for a great movie. Over all this is one of the best movies of all time and should be seen by all people who enjoy classic movies.,Psycho

It's a real pity (I'd rather say a shame) that he didn't earn either an Oscar nomination, because his work was perfect. That's my point of view: without Mr. Hitchcock, ""Psycho"" wouldn't have been the same; but without Tony Perkins, it simply wouldn't have been at all.",Psycho

The shower scene for which Marion is stabbed to death is deemed to be as skill-full as cinematography could get in this time period. The storyline was interesting and served as a bit of a mystery to the viewer. The acting was believable and they could not have possibly cast better actors for each role. The grim and sort of scary storyline stood out to among the films i've viewed from this time period. I liked how it was kept a secret until the end that Norman's mother was dead, although I kind of started to suspect this in the middle. It was unusual for the ""main character"" (Marion) to be killed off so early on, and this came as a bit of a shock to me. And surprises in films are what make them successful as opposed to predictable plots.This film is legendary in the history or horror films and set the bar for scary movies to come.",Psycho
716,alangalpert,Iconic film,10,27 May 2010,"""Psycho"" is unquestionably one of the finest films of all time, and probably the greatest thriller (although there are several other contenders, all directed by Hitchcock). The acting is first-rate; the cinematography is superb; and the musical score (by Bernard Herrmann) is iconic. (Incredibly, the score did not receive an Oscar nomination.) Hitchcock has been deservedly praised for his direction, but I feel it is time to give credit where credit is due. I recently read the book on which the movie was based, also titled ""Psycho"". It was written by Robert Bloch in 1959, a year before the movie was made. Except for two scenes that weren't in the book, and a couple of memorable lines (most notably, ""Well, a boy's best friend is his mother""), the movie follows the book so closely that almost all of the credit should go to the author of the book, not the director of the movie. If you have seen and enjoyed the movie, pick up a copy of the book. Only then can you appreciate who the real genius was behind ""Psycho"".There are quite a few, mostly minor, differences between the book and movie. As I read the book, I wondered why the changes had been made. Here are some examples. In the movie, Ms. Crane's name is Marion; in the book, it is Mary. In the movie, she lives and works in Phoenix, Arizona; in the book, she is from Ft. Worth, Texas. In the movie, Norman Bates is thin and young; in the book, he is fat and middle-aged. In the book, he wears glasses; in the movie, he doesn't. In the movie, there are twelve cabins at the motel; in the book, there are six. I found no fewer than thirty-five differences, but almost none of them made any sense to me.",Psycho
717,theocharous_an,Horror it is!,9,25 December 2015,"I'm not a fan of horror movies. In fact I hadn't watched any horror movie before watching Psycho. I like thrillers though and I've seen many movies with psychopath serial killers (se7en, the silence of the lambs, identity, zodiac, criminal minds...). So I thought, it's a serial killer black and white movie from 1960, how scary can it be? I've never been so wrong. I was familiar with the split personality thing from other movies and so I guessed that Norman and his mother were one person very early. And in the scene in the basement I was almost sure that we would see a skeleton sitting in that chair. The movie wasn't shocking or twisting at all for me. AND YET IT SCARED THE S*** OUT OF ME! It's been three days now and I still have trouble sleeping. I'm not sure why, I mean I've seen much more troubled psychopaths and watched much more brutal murders and wasn't scared a bit. Alfred Hitchcock is definitely a genius. Music is excellent and it seems that it plays a big role in scaring the viewer. Right now, I feel like I don't want to watch a horror movie again. But I'm sure I will never be able to forget Psycho.",Psycho
718,danielefanin-17409,Nomen Omen,9,24 May 2020,"If The Birds is Alfred Hitchcock's most philosophical and technically challenging movie, Psycho is the most evident, even brazen, proof of the Leytonstone's director genius, an impossible movie bet that he won hands down!Against the decision of Paramount, which regarded the filming of the Robert Bloch's 1959 novel of the same name, loosely inspired by a real murderer and grave robber, ""too repulsive"", Hitchcock defied the major and went ahead to fulfil his contractual obligation for a last film with the studio by purchasing the rights of the novel, producing the film with his own money, shooting in black and white after four years he had abandoned this feature, using his TV crew and the Universal studios, which he would then join for The Birds, his next film three years later.But Hitchcock slap in the face of the film establishment was even harsher, punching below the belt of the Motion Picture Production Code, which set the cinema morale of the time, from the very start, with the opening scene showing and openly acknowledging, if not celebrating, an extra-marital affair and half-naked affair, and culminating later on in the pivotal shower sequence, with its nudity and the trailblazing slasher, Grand Guignol effects, used again at the end of the film to reveal Norman's mother, or, more trivially, showing for the first time in American movies a toilet flushing. He didn't stop here, though, introducing a strict and unusual ""no late admission"" policy for the film screenings, inspired by Clouzot's Les Diaboliques, not to mention the game-changer of eliminating the female lead, a false protagonist, just before half of movie running time, leaving a very controversial Norman Bates as the only main character.
Unlikely for Hitchcock, Norman Bates persona is rather closely modelled on the real source of Robert Bloch's novel, Wisconsin killer Ed Gein, who like Norman Bates was a solitary murderer living in an isolated rural location, had a deceased and domineering mother to whom he had built a sealed off shrine in his residence and dressed in her clothes.Notwithstanding all these idiosyncratic deviations, Psycho was an immediate success at the box office and still today is Hitchcock's' movie with the highest cumulative worldwide gross, forcing also part of the critics, originally puzzled by the film, to appreciate its unconventional values and the Academy to nominate it for four Oscars, giving none though and ignoring Anthony Perkins amazing performance.In fact, one of the marvels of Psycho is indeed Anthony Perkins rendering of Norman Bates, making the character the ultimate psycho-murdered, a perverse icon of film history. While homosexuality had already been implied in Rope, Norman Bates' gender dysphoria becomes in Psycho the key element of the story, sublimely as well as subliminally played, most likely helped by his own sexual preferences, by Anthony Perkins, who subtly but unnoticeably reveals it early on during his dinner conversation with Marion, and it is actually plainly explained and theorised, even if maybe too didactically, at the end of the movie, just before the final, haunting close-up on Anthony Perkins' deranged look and female-voiced thoughts, themselves worth an Oscar. RegrettablyA daring, innovative masterpiece that went a long way to seal the 50s cinematography, opening the door for the more controversial 60s.",Psycho
719,lutzkevinandrew,Psycho,8,18 November 2015,Alfred Hitchcock has done it again. Psycho has set the bar for horror films and its still a great film to watch in this day and age. The ways Hitchcock uses the different camera angles to build suspense is incredible. The way director Hitchcock uses sound to unleash a chilling sense of fear to the audience is magnificent. Psycho is a must watch if your interested in watching a suspenseful horror film. Vera Miles as Lila Crane does a great job in this film and her character is outstanding. The ability to create suspense and thrill is an art and Alfred Hitchcock does just that and more. I would recommend this film to anyone who appreciates a classic horror film.,Psycho
720,livieelynn,A woman tries to attain money but ends up in a bad situation.,6,17 December 2015,"For a black and white film, this was extremely well done. The lighting and contrast was perfect and really set the mood for a good film. It wasn't too bright or too dark and it outlined characters faces and the blood during the ""violent"" scenes. The camera was great when shooting at different angles. Especially in dramatic scenes, the camera would focus in and out of the scenes to add more flare to the subject and take long shots. I felt like the meaning behind the movie wasn't that strong because it was just a ""horror"" film. Behind it, though, there was definitely a hint of mistrust and deceit. It kind of showed that psychos are everywhere , no matter where you go and that you should be very careful in going to new places and with strangers because they could not be who they say they are. Acting was okay and some scenes you could tell were really fake but a good film overall.",Psycho
721,hirotohirotogackt,Profound film!,7,18 June 2017,"I think that Hitchcock's films often have the meaning on every scene. For example, he used a mirror and tried to show double sides of a human, or in Vertigo, he reflected the Coital Tower at love scenes. However I thought that ""Psycho"" had scenes that played games with me. They were the parts that Marion Crane had run away with the money of her picked of a man. In that part, policeman picked on her action and shadowed her car with his car. It seemed that his tailing is persistent, but anything did not happen after all. I have another instance. She had been driving in heavy rains until she has arrived at BATES MOTEL. Maybe, the audience thought that something would happen, but it was just heavy rains. Anything have never happen. Are those Hitchcock's mischief? I thought he had kidded the audience. Next, I noticed about Psycho's soundtrack, ""The Murder"". This tune is pretty shrilling. People tend to feel the nervous to the register. So this music matches ""Psycho"". And it is exaggeration that this music makes the film become famous. In Japanese TV shows, it has been often used on the scary shots. I really think that influence which ""Psycho"" brought the world of movies and TV was so huge!",Psycho
722,okk07,Great film,8,9 August 2017,"First, I thought the music of psycho affect our mind deeply. When I saw Psycho, I was into Osycho's world and felt fear as if I was there. I think that if there are no music in this film, I will not be fear. I noticed the importance of music in a film. Second, I thought if Norman's mother killed Marion, his mother may be psycho too. Surely the person who killed Marion was Norman, but Norman was surprised when he saw the corpse of Marion. Also, finally, the Norman's smile that was possessed by his mother gave us fear. Because of that, I thought not only Norman but also his mother was psycho. Third, I thought Norman's name express not only normal but also strong connection with his mother. It is because his mother's name was Norma. The name of Norman resemble Norma very much. Finally, Hitchcock gave us much surprise. First is the scene of love's hotel. Second is the scene that Marion was killed at the first half. Third, the killer was Norman. I enjoyed seeing this film with fear.",Psycho
723,ypandalove,Terrible love,7,31 July 2017,"I have met this movie for the first time. I felt that this movie was the kind of horror all the time, because in a play the multiple murder were repeated and the fact of matter wasn't shown at the end. Moreover, the sound track gave us the feeling of impatience and tension.I think that ""Psycho"" and ""Vertigo"" have something in common with women. In ""Vertigo"" Scottie tried to appropriate Madeline for his personal use by making ideal woman. Whereas in ""Psycho"" there is the description comparing women to stuffed birds from Norman's lines. I felt that these express the men's will wanting to make women their own. I wonder if women are passive compared with men is really the case.Also, this film shows strange relationship of gender, because Norman and his mother have the reference of incest in Norman's brain. Of course mother and son are not lover but family by thinking about blood relationship from commonsense. So the love of between parent and child is ""abnormal"". That unusual love invaded Norman's spirit and ate in his heart. That sounds like so terrible.",Psycho

Anthony Perkins does a fantastic job as Norman Bates. During the entire film he has this nervousness about him that is so believable. Even at the end of the film, he sits there with this blank stare, yet it portrays a lot of emotion. The use of light and shadows was done beautifully. Obviously the famous shower seen is hard to forget, but few remember the scene where ""mother"" kills the private detective.

I mean, ""haunted-house"" dramatic effects, as some people call it, are just plain ridiculous. I know for sure that a lot of people in my generation would have the same reaction I did when I saw the first murder: burst out laughing. But reading some of the comments here, it seems to have scared people in the movie theaters and some users claim to still be scared about it. Well, I really feel like asking, is it all a generation gap thing? Can't be, after all, there are way scarier things around now, in all types of scares, especially visually (heh, the skeleton..).I have to say, though, it's well done and well played, feels good to watch. The only problem here is looking and sounding silly on the climaxes.That, and that the content is.. well, not that complex. I mean, we've all seen a load of stories about multiple personalities by now.. and this one isn't specially interesting. Again, too much emphasis on this. Also, the characters in general are just slightly above general. We see a little too many ""hollywood""esque and shallow personalities. Sometimes, the dialogue flows in mysterious ways (sheriff scene).. showing us that it wasn't very well translated from the script writer's mind.So all in all, it's worth seeing for the laughs and for being a landmark for the genre.

Hitchcock is a master at making the audience feel what he wants them to feel. He knows when to when to hold back for suspense and when to let it all out for shocks. Hitchcock created one of the most chilling characters in cinema with the schizophrenic Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins.

It's nearly insane to have the main actress killed off halfway through the film but it all works as an amazing movie. Anthony Perkins definitely made a name for himself with his amazing work in this film. The soundtrack and score definitely leave you on the edge of you seat.

The way Norman speaks and his odd collection of stuffed birds make me feel weird and thrilling, after that strange murders happen repeatedly, but I couldn't imagine who causes. Especially, the background music is effective for this film. Thanks to BGM and camera works, this film successfully builds scary and tension. Norman has an excessive attachment on his mother and looks eccentric. This film relates to complicated mental disease and criminal emotion. That setting is elaborated and interesting.

Stop reading thse comments, get up, take a shower, then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it, don't rent. You will not regret it.""Psycho"" is easily the best horror-thriller of all time. Nothing even comes close...maybe ""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) but not really.""Psycho"" has one of the best scripts you'll ever find in a movie. The movie's only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses, you realize that Hitchcock (GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS!) in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose, because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best mid-plot point and climactic twist in thriller history, and certainly the best-directed ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer's mind.Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock's direction, which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history's best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh, still radiant, spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock's genius was in his ability to 1) frighten without gore and 2) leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors (like the great Jean Renoir could never do). ""Psycho"" is clearly its own phenomenon, despite all the big-name talent involved.Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while falling-on-the-floor laughing.One more thing...Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got much-deserved accolades for this film, but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant's 1998 (dear God make it stop!) shot-for-shot ""remake."" Though the movies are nearly identical, Hitchcock's is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere (some of the creepiness is lost with color). This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh's character and Perkins, a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role - his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s - proves that he played the part perhaps too well.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.Eleven-and-a-half out of ten stars.",Psycho

I had no idea that she was dead and that Norman was actually Mother. I found it really cool that the conversation between Norman and ""Mother"" was heard from outside the manor. It gave the feel that there were two people talking to each other.
Seeing Norman in his mother's outfit actually gave me the creeps, but I love the fact that at the end of the movie, the psychiatrist explains that Norman has a split-personality, but the personality of mother is the most dominant side now.
I also love how the gore scenes were made for black and white pictures. if I remember correctly, most of those movies used chocolate syrup because it had the right consistency to use as fake blood.",Psycho
741,AlecYager,Favorite 60's film,10,7 November 2020,"This film by Alfred Hitchcock is at the top of the list for my all time favorite films of the 60's. In the beginning while Marion is on the run with the $40,000 and she is being followed by the police you can almost feel how she would feeling. She played off that part very well. When you're on the run like that and you're filled with guilt it just seems like everybody knows what you did and everybody is out to get you. I also love the transition from protagonist to protagonist after Bates commits the two murders. In the beginning you expect to be going on this long journey with Marion while she's on the run with the $40,000 but next thing you know you're 40 minutes into the movie and she's being stabbed to death in the shower. It leaves you thinking ""where does the movie really go from here?"" And then it transitions to the private detective's perspective of him investigating where she might have taken off with the money.... and then BOOM, he gets stabbed by bates and now the mystery continues. In all honesty I was not predicting either of these murders, and unpredictable events in movies are what make me keep my eyes glued to the screen. The best part is probably the ending where the psychiatrist is explaining how Bates is mentally ill with split personalities; one of those personalities being his mother. Overall this film is on the top of my leaderboard when it comes to favorites. 10/10",Psycho
742,colinpsquires,We all go a little mad sometimes......,9,13 November 2020,"As I begin writing this review I can't help but feel a subtle chill run down my back, this is a testament to Alfred Hitchcock's successful execution of such an unsettling story. Viewed by many as one of the greatest films ever made, there's no doubt in my mind as to why Psycho has such a legendary reputation. Released in 1960, Psycho opened the door for many films in the thriller/slasher/horror genre that would follow. Psycho indices you from beginning to end. Each scene has your heart racing increasingly faster as the film progresses and for a different reason each time. This film draws you in to one situations and then turns you around right into another before you can even realize. Hitchcock masterfully pieces this
unique story together. I felt Psycho came across as a very complete movie, captivating performances, appealing cinematography, an unsettling score, and just the ability to draw you in is all pretty remarkable. The score alone is enough to make to shutter a little and it is paired up with every scene perfectly. The shots Hitchcock provides have a way of putting the films situation into perspective for the audience. It makes you feel part of the story and takes you on an intensified journey of angst and curiosity. Psycho's performances were convincing all around, but the real gem of this cast is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins performance is the backbone of Psycho, Norman Bates is a genuinely chilling character with a lot more too him than just simply being strange. The concept of Norman Bates and his mother adds to this films uniqueness and disturbing feel. 100% recommend, especially to horror/thriller fans who have been holding out.",Psycho
743,jcommerford-43129,More than a Thriller,8,16 November 2020,"There is no thriller like this one. This film just feels dark and evil and makes you uncomfortable..and that's what makes this film so fantastic. From the start to the end, something always feels off. This is the type of movie that brings out our inner detective.The visuals in this film are in black and white, however I would not prefer color because the eerie feeling black and white creates. Some people may disagree with that statement, and in response I would recommend watching The Lighthouse, which was release within the last few years. However, it seemed to be m ore creepy than the other thriller released that year. I believe this is because the black and white visuals create a whole new level of sinister.Another thing that made this film uncomfortable was Normans stalking his guests. People always have the fear that someone is watching them, especially when they are attempting to be in privacy. However, Norman intentionally put his guests that he is fond of in the first room. This way, the room is right beside the office, where he has peeking holes. This just makes everyone in the audience cringe. But this is what makes this movie so great, it ventures into ideas and scenarios we do not want to imagine.In conclusion, this is most definitely one of the best thrillers ever made. Every twist and surprise hits harder than the last. I think Alfred Hitchcock Did a wonderful job with this film. I also have seen the show on Netflix which is much different than the original.",Psycho
744,sucks-9,Psycho is the best film ever made!,10,18 November 2008,"Without a single doubt, Alfred Hitchcock is the greatest director who ever lived. So, obviously, the fans of his always choose what film they think his masterpiece. For me, that film would have to be Psycho. There's just no flaws. The score by Bernard Hermann is magnificently ominous and eerie. The cinematography is beautifully photographed in black & white. The story is original (it was in 1960). The script is well-written with crisp dialogue and real people with real emotions. And the acting is superb from Janet Leigh's screaming in the shower to Anthony Perkins' jittery stuttering when he's talking to Detective Arbogast. The best scene in the film is when the psychiatrist is explaining what events had just taken place to Vera Miles & John Gavin. Psycho is the #1 movie ever made!",Psycho

This is an American classic. Every one knows it or at least knows the score or the shower seen. It has been copied in so many movies and TV shows. Every time I think of a spooky house I think of the ""Psycho's"" house on top of the hill. The camera angels used were a major part of the movies uniqueness, it really added drama. And even though the shower scene didn't show the the woman getting stabbed it didn't matter. It was a montage shot (lots of short shots put together) and it added thrill. Then at then end of the scene when you see the blood spinning down the drain and then it spins into her lifeless eye is the BEST.",Psycho
746,imahottieandahalf,is it mystery? is it suspense? no! it's PSYCHO!,9,20 February 2004,"Alfred Hitchcock, born in 1899, is known as the `Master of Suspense.' Becoming a director in 1925, he has been entertaining people ever since. One of the classics, and probably close to the most widely known, is Psycho, made in 1960.     Now putting into fact that they didn't have much to work with concerning special effects in those times, this movie may not be the most frightening ever. But, special effects aren't what Hitchcock was all about. He was a man of mystery and always wanted to keep tension between the viewer and the film. He could create the perfect scene by moving the angle of the shot just one certain way. Filming techniques and plot seem to be his forte.
     In Psycho, one method that Hitchcock used to create a dramatic scene is the placement of the camera shots. For instance, in a ""get away,"" he would film the character while they were in a car, then show a scene out of the car. He repeated this same idea, coming closer to their face every time it re-entered the car...so close that it almost makes the viewer uncomfortable.
     Another aspect of Hitchcock's movies that makes them very memorable are the sets and the way that the characters move, talk and act.  For example, a character may stutter, fidget, or talk fast when presented with certain situations.  With sets and designs, he always tried to play with the look and feel of a scene.  The mansion that was used in this movie created a very mysterious aura around it.  This could be because of the placement, which was, on top of a dark hill with many ascending steps.  It could also be because the lighting was always dim and never really showed the details, creating wonder and mystery.      Obtaining an overall 8.6/10 stars, this movie is clearly brilliantly made, being loved by millions.  With drama, suspense, a good plot and a great director, you've created a masterpiece.",Psycho
747,firstchance,psycho,8,16 December 2011,"Psycho is a movie I have seen more than once in my life. It was usually for different reasons each time, but I have always been a fan of Alfred Hitchcock. I like how the movie is twisted and the characters are very interesting to me. I also like the fact that it's in black and white and I think that the music makes all the difference in the movie. I loved the camera work in this movie as well. The perspective views and then some of the close up were almost abstract in my opinion, but I defiantly enjoyed this film. I think that this film created a lot of suspense in the plot line. The music was also a benefactor in creating drama or suspense as well. I never lost interest in what was happening in the film.",Psycho

I'm honestly thrilled that I took the time to do that for my cinema class, because I've discovered yet another incredible movie I probably never would have watched any other way. It's a perfect example of a late code film that's trying to deal with mature subject matter. I find the use of cuts and editing and lighting to keep a murder mystery to Code really fascinating to watch, and I have, over and over again. While at times the movie has a certain ""underexposed"" feel (very dark, that is to say), that hardly detracts from the plot. In fact, it adds to it. You really feel the imposing darkness at night, the dim lighting of the house above the Bates hotel, and the brightness of day. Also, the use of sound is really interesting not with the voices or the various background noises, but the score itself, especially in the iconic ""Shower scene"". Truly a must-see.",Psycho
749,LindsayHuba,Psycho,9,19 December 2012,"I enjoyed this movie very much. I thought the plot was excellent and really held my attention. Hitchcock is known to make great movies and I don't think he fell short of that with this one. It is a great horror film, and a great film noir. The way it is edited is unique too. For intense, the bathroom shower scene. You never actually see the knife cutting into her body, but the way it is filmed and edited, you know what is happening and feel the intensity of the moment none the less. Another unique, and definitely Hitchcock aspect, is when the private detective falls down the stairs after being stabbed. It is a very dramatic and non-believable way of him falling, but it is done in a unique Albert Hitchcock way. The photography in this film is well done too. The use of low-key lighting helps with the suspense and dramatic feel that Hitchcock is looking for in this film.",Psycho
750,chriswright1969,We all go a little mad sometimes,10,21 June 2020,"It is almost impossible to explain to today's generation that Psycho is the greatest horror movie ever made. Probably also to yesterday's generation. Why ? Because Psycho twisted every rule of movie clichés in 1960. The lead is unexpectedly killed in the first 3rd part of the film. The private eye who usually solves these kind of mysteries gets slashed. The mismatched couple who solves the mystery are unlikable characters. The most identifiable and sympathetic character in the film is Norman Bates. In the final twist this boy-next-door turns out to be a sexually deranged serial killer. His creepy close up in the end scene shows him talking to himself in self-delusion. The greatest terror of all is that nice Norman Bates is insane. There is nothing we can do about it, except to watch out.",Psycho
751,AgentDice,"""A boy's best friend is his mother. """,10,21 October 2013,"Without a doubt one of the most influential films of all time. Timeless classic.Whether this is a true slasher film is debatable, but it's influence on the genres of horror and suspense/thriller is undeniable.This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off.

Still you are thinking of something that will happen and the opposite happens. Maybe murder is expected but getting rid of all evidence that is something different.With black and white this film is done do great that you have to notice the great camera-work with it.

753,jacobclark512,The Perfect Horror Film,10,4 March 2014,"Psycho is a ""less is more"" type of film. The minimal budget allotted to Hitchcock made him simpler and more restrained in his film-making. This allowed the story and acting to shine through instead of the big names and huge flair of earlier films like North by Northwest. Janet Leigh is stunning as Marion Crane and ensures that we remember what little screen time she has. The rest of the supporting cast is memorable to a point and adds emotional depth to the story; however, it is Anthony Perkins who steals the show. His performance as Norman Bates is one of the most stunning performances of all time. Perkins also hides the film's twist well throughout the entire movie, adding to Psycho's suspense. The score by Bernard Herrmann is excellent and adds incredibly to the suspense, especially during the infamous shower scene. That single scene is perhaps the defining scene of Hitchcock's career. It not only serves as the single catalyst for the plot, it also shows the attention to detail he gave to his movies. Psycho is the best horror film ever made for its reliability on every other factor besides gore to create suspense. It revolutionized the genre, along with Hitchcock's career, to be more focused on substance rather than style.",Psycho

This is what horror and psychological thrillers are supposed to do! Mess with your head! Oh, and the camera-work and lighting were awesome too!

In the beginning I wasn't sure how this movie was going to be any kind of thriller or horror. I thought in the beginning the lighting was a lot better than in the end. Towards the end everything was so dark.I believe that to go along with the story the lighting fit in perfectly. I also noticed the music in the background they did an amazing job with that it was just in the right places even if there wasn't something bad going to happen you thought there was going to be.

763,ericglunneborg,Stabbing in the Shower!!!!,9,19 February 2004,"In the opening scene of Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock does a terrific job by playing the dissonant overture of music in the beginning while rolling the credits. In which is giving viewers a taste of what the movie is going to be like beginning to end. As most of us know, Hitchcock is known for holding viewers in suspense during his movies. He is, without a doubt, `The master of suspense.' When Marian Crane (Janet Lee) is fleeing town, that is where the suspense starts. At that point, she is stopped at a traffic light, and people are crossing the cross walk. The man who walks in front of her boss in the crosswalk is Alfred Hitchcock. A typical Alfred Hitchcock film always has him playing a small part, such as a man smoking a pipe while reading a newspaper. After Alfred Hitchcock Walks in front of her car, her boss walks right behind him, and notices Marian in the car. She then notices her boss, and took off. As she is driving down the road, she has voices running in her head about stolen money, while the dissonant music plays in the background. First time viewers think this is when she dies, but she doesn't until later. That just goes to show how Alfred Hitchcock is, `The master of suspense.'
Hitchcock has an interesting way of making movies, too. He was the first person ever to come up with the dissonant music for horror films. His lighting and camera techniques are also interesting. For example, when Marian is being followed by the cop, the camera shows an angle of the cop car in the rear view mirror of her car. Not every movie is perfect, though. In the bathroom at the Bates motel, also known as the classic shower stabbing scene, Marian gets murdered. As Marian is screaming, this reviewer noticed that she giggled a little bit. Other than that, the part it was perfect. If you haven't seen Psycho before, but want to see it, then sit down and watch it till it is done.",Psycho

765,SuperDuperMCA,OG horror,8,2 April 2013,Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a god tier horror movie and I'd say its probably the best example of classic horror. The story has at this point been told and remixed 1000 different ways over the years but because of Alfred's understanding of human fear and his incredible skill as a director no other film maker can come close to creating as captivating of a psychopath as the infamous Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). I love the symbolism in the very last scene where Norman sits alone in the chair and claims he'd never hurt a fly. Very clever and unorthodox camera angles keep the viewer on the edge of their seat while watching this film especially during the scenes where Norman attacks his victims and the famous shrieking sound effect begins to play. If you have never seen this movie and enjoy horror movies it is definitely worth watching. Even though compared to current film it may seem dated because of the lack of special effects and computer animation the rawness and great use of music and sound effects by Hitchcock make this slasher flick stand the test of time.,Psycho
766,Chris042711,Stands the test of time,10,9 May 2014,"I feel that this movie is a classic that all people should watch, especially those who like scary movies. Psycho was released in 1960 and is often the most remembered film from that era. The film uses a great use of lighting by combining low key with high key lighting styles. Low key lighting in the film was used to show eerie settings and to emphasize they mystery of what is really going on their and in the house which is located directly behind the motel which a good portion of the film takes place in.In the film Marion is a respectable lady who is in a relationship that is strained by financial burdens. When a high rolling customer comes into her work looking to buy a house in cash. She is entrusted with the cash and told to put in in the bank immediately. She doesn't do this though. Instead she takes the money and goes on the run. Unfortunately for her she runs into Norman Bate's who runs the bates motel. She takes a room and appeases Norman by having dinner with him. As they are talking she offends Norman when talking about his controlling mother. So Norma does the normal thing anyone else would do and kills her in the shower while dressed up as his mother. This scene is now one of the most know pictures in Hollywood now. After he kills her a private detective comes who is tracking down Marion. he asks to many questions for Normans liking so naturally Norman also kills him too. Norman is later caught thanks to Marion's lover and sister investigating the house behind the hotel when they find the decomposing body of Normans mom. It turns out that normal went crazy and took on and acted as his mother ad Norma but in the end committed to the role of his mom and psychologically in his head became his mother.

Alfred Hitchcock's directing is at its best in this film. I only need to mention the shower scene and the final shot of the movie to prove my point. Psycho sets a creepy and often unsettling atmosphere throughout the movie and Alfred Hitchcock shows the audience that he is in full control of his craft. Psycho can feel slow at times but it is definitely worth it and just adds to the tension of the film. Anthony Perkins gives the performance of his career as the now legendary character of Norman Bates as well as Janet Leigh as Marion Crane. Psycho even though it was made in 1960 can still make the audience feel uneasy even today and is truly a staple of the horror genre.,Psycho
768,boy-13,....ultimate Hitchcockian masterpiece....,10,25 August 1999,"This ultimate Hitchcockian masterpiece is an artful, suspenseful, beautiful, and horrifying thriller! So many taboos of the era were abolished by this film - violence, brief nudity, transvestism, and (gasp!) a flushing toilet. While all of this has lost its shock value by today's standards, the overall grasp this film has on the viewer will never be outdated. Considered by many to be Alfred Hitchcock's greatest work, this is undoubtedly one of the highlights of film history.The story begins in Phoenix, Arizona, with a woman named Marian Crane (Janet Leigh) and her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), in a hotel room enjoying an afternoon tryst. They are in love, but the problem is that Sam is married and can't afford to get a divorce. No problem, actually. Marian happens to work at a bank. So, later, she steals a bundle of cash ($40,000) and heads off to Los Angeles where Sam lives. During her road trip, this blonde beauty tires and checks into the Bates Motel. There, she meets the odd, bird-like hotel proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). She converses with Norman in his scary, bird-filled parlor and soon comes to realize the strange relationship he shares with his mother. Soon, out of left-field, Marian is slashed-off in what is probably one of the most famous scenes in movie history - the wet and bloody shower scene. This was certainly a film first - the demise of the main character halfway through the picture (it was actually an experiment by Hitchcock to gauge audience reaction). Now what? Well, an investigator (Martin Balsam), Sam, and Marian's sister Lila (Vera Miles), all converge on this house of horrors to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Marian. What will happen? Who will survive? It's all too suspenseful and fun.The acting is on a tremendous level and Hitchcock's direction, as always, is just awesome. Plus, it is impossible not to love the violin-drenched soundtrack by composer-extraordinarre, Bernard Herrmann. ""Psycho"" is a historical event. Not only because of the top-notch production itself, but because of the facts behind the film. For instance, did you know that the infamous shower scene that only lasts 45 seconds, took Hitchcock one week to film to his satisfaction? It's interesting to note, too, that actress Miles was chosen for the role of Lila as a consolation prize of sorts. See, Hitchcock had cast her as the lead in 1958's ""Vertigo"", but she became pregnant just before production. Therefore, Kim Novak got the dual role. But Hitchcock didn't forget about the lovely Miles, giving her a role in one of the most famous movies ever. Also, ""Psycho"" was a work of secrecy and surprise. Hitchcock bought the original novel by Bloch, from Bloch, for $9,000, anonymously. Then he bought as many copies of the book that he could find, just to keep the end a secret. Then, when ""Psycho"" was released in theatres, Hitchcock had strict instructions with the theatre owners not to let anyone in the film late, since Leigh's role was so short and she was billed as the ""star"". This is a terrific film in every aspect. No wonder ""Psycho"" was listed by the American Film Institute, in 1998, as one of the 100 Greatest American Films.Hitchcock cameo: He is the man in the cowboy hat standing on the sidewalk outside Marian's office.",Psycho
769,bw92116,The craft of film-making brought to perfection,10,13 July 2007,"There is no finer example of the craft of film-making than ""Psycho."" Every aspect of the production is brilliantly executed, and contributes to the film as a whole, rather than detracting from the whole. The script laden with double meanings, the note-perfect acting, the astonishing camera work and editing, the background music, the sleazy, run-down atmosphere - it all coalesces into one unforgettable excursion through the prurient, dishonest, anxiety-ridden substratum that lies just an inch beneath the supposedly placid, polite surface of American society. Hitchcock masterfully manipulates not only the audience's emotional states but its train of thought as well. The viewer is kept in a subtle state of confusion and bewilderment as to what is actually happening, what is going to happen, and what the characters' true motivations are - while at the same time the story is propelled forward at a brisk and steady pace. Even though I have seen this film all the way through 6 or 7 times, I always find myself irresistibly drawn into it all over again whenever it is shown. This is one of the true masterpieces of cinema, in that it exemplifies masterful film-making in all the disciplines required to produce a great film.",Psycho

Anthony Perkins should have been.Anthony Perkins was so good in that role that he won't be remembered for anything else ever again. The image of him in his mother's dress with the knife before he charged towards Vera Miles is one that will forever be engraved in my mind and the fact that he got no recognition for it is a crime!! This film is truly perfect....I can't think of any flaw at all!!",Psycho

772,carlosmiguel_1987,"""Psicosis"" (1960)",8,17 December 2020,"""Psycho"" (1960) the great masterpiece of Alfred Hitchcock, with the interpretation of Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, John Gavin, Vera Miles, inspired by the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch (1959).The film puts you in tension from the beginning with its claustrophobic music the role Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates) plays is incredible.As a young man, he kills his mother by poisoning her, only to have her mummified in the basement or in the bedroom, believing everyone that her mother is still alive.
Norman works in the motel as if nothing happened, killing his clients and disguising himself as his mother, the most mythical scene of the movie when the actress (Janet Leigh) Marion Crane, is in the shower and sees Norman arrive with his knife, and the background music makes your hair stand on end, shocking when the camera focuses on the blood that falls in the shower.The film was shot in the universal studios, was nominated for 4 Oscars: best actress, best director, best black and white film, best art direction-set or decoration.It won none, in the Golden Globes Janet Leigh managed to win it.",Psycho
773,RickBrands,"Visually impressive, but doesn't hold up.",7,27 November 2010,"While I know I'll anger a lot of thriller fans, here's my two cents: this is one of the least enjoyable Hitchcock classics. To clarify: if you compare Psycho to North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train, Vertigo or Rebecca, I can't see how any self-proclaimed film fan wouldn't conclude that it falls considerably short. Even other Hitch classics I don't particularly love or hate (such as The Birds, Rear Window or Marnie) trigger a wider emotional response than the pretty simplistic shock effects which are all Psycho has to offer. Of course there's some great cinematography, but it isn't backed by any involving factors other than sheer horror, or the kind of hammy pseudo-psychology Hitchcock already tried his hand on in Spellbound.My reasonably kind rating of seven out of ten is mostly motivated by its historical importance - even if you take into account that Peeping Tom, which I think is a far superior film with a similar theme, relentlessly flopped earlier in the same year - as it opened the mainstream public's eyes regarding the horror/thriller genre. But if you've seen Psycho once (which, in fact, any film fanatic should), to me there's no real reason to watch it again.",Psycho
774,xjwx15,Psycho review,8,19 October 2012,"I would recommend this movie to anyone. I'm not one for suspense, but I liked this movie. On the other hand, I personally wouldn't call it a horror film. But for when it was made it is pretty accurate. I thought all the lighting and sound was perfect, I didn't notice anything jumping out at me with those two categories. I thought the camera angles and shots were well done too. What I did notice though, was the pacing of the film. I thought it started out slower and was fast at the end. Overall I liked the twist, I thought it was a good movie to watch and I would watch it again. It kept me entertained the whole time, and waiting for whatever was next.",Psycho
775,askewglasses,Must be Psycho for not Loving It,9,19 August 2013,"Right at the beginning we get an awesome credit sequence from Saul Bass. And that really sets the mood for what Psycho is, a disturbing, constantly changing masterpiece of horror and suspense. So many elements come together in this movie that make it a first-rate film. First off you have the score by Bernard Herrmann, which matches the mood perfectly. It's slow and building, it rises with tension, and it explodes with action. Next you have the plot, which is one of the most well-constructed stories I have seen. It contains such brilliant ideas and portrays then in the most interesting ways. Then you have the wonderful performances. Janet Leigh gives a very enduring performance as She tries to justify her actions while also running away from the consequences. But Psycho also contains one of the best performances in the entirety of film. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is creepy, he is scary, he is awkward, and he is nervous. As the plot moves foreword he gets just more and more interesting. His performance is just amazing to behold, and it is incredibly important in film history. But even with how much I give his performance praise, I still think there is one other element that is the best part of Psycho. It is the cinematography. Every moment is a wonderful shot, everything had a great placement and direction. Every this is stunning visually and I love every minute of Psycho, its nothing but the finest.",Psycho
776,Blondeatheart56,Definitely the best horror film of all time,10,18 February 2004,"""Psycho"" has been called the best horror movie of all time, and it's no surprise that it has considering that it was directed by The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.  Hitchcock, who has directed (and sometimes produced) 53 films,was definitely successful with this one.  It makes no difference that 'Psycho"" is a 1960 film, it is just as good, if not better, than any horror film made today. The film has an eeriness to it.  Even though it is not constant killing after killing, it is still very creepy.  The biggest factor contributing to the ""on the edge of your seat"" feeling in the film is the music.  Throughout the entire film the music is unsettling, suspenseful, and it gives the viewer an uncomfortable feeling that is hard to explain.  A scene as simple as someone driving in a car can becomeintense and even a little scary once the music begins.  It is never dull and it is always interesting.  There is no doubt that ""Psycho"" without it's fast paced, loud, and startling music would not be the truly terrifying film that it is. Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, the psycho.  Perkins' acting job is verywell done and actually really believable.  He doesn't need to stick with one type of acting to be good.  He can be a nice guy, he can be mad, he can be sad, he can even behave as a lunatic and in all situations his acting is realistic. When it comes to Anthony Perkins' acting job in ""Psycho"" there is no cheesiness to be found. There are many other great performances by great actors/actresses in ""Psycho."" Such as Janet Leigh as Marianne Crane, Vera Miles as Lila Crane, and JohnGavin as Sam Lumus.  While all of their acting jobs are believable andentertaining to watch, there are a few times when they may have overdone it or come across as cheesy.   But put those times aside and you're left with one very good actor and two very good actresses.  Besides, nobody's perfect. ""Psycho"" is a black and white film that takes place mostly at night. Because of that, some of the backgrounds in a few scenes don't look as realistic as they could.  The viewer may be able to tell that they aren't real and if they are real the viewer is likely to think that they aren't.  This does not take away from the film at all. Regardless of some cheesy acting or backgrounds that look fake, ""Psycho"" isstill the best horror film of all time, and there's no arguing with that.",Psycho
777,Jennydavis131,a chilling thriller,10,14 March 2004,"Psycho was the movie that put Alfred Hitchcock on the map and leads to his great career. Psycho is an all time thriller and suspense movie for all people. Ten minutes into the film you're on the edge of your seat asking yourself what's going to happen next. Hitchcock was great with developing his characters and the plot. As you sit and watch the film you are amazed by the genius of Hitchcock on the way that he not only shoots the film but also the lighting and music. The lighting helps make everything seem eerie, and the  music puts chills down your spin. The plot twists will keep your head spinning and is mind blowing. Through all this suspense you may even find some humor. As you meet the characters one by one you hope that you will never be in their situation. The reviewer would highly recommend this film to everyone, even if you don't like scary movies. The reviewer would rate this film 10/10.",Psycho
778,Blondi85,great suspense,10,20 February 2004,"This movie will definitely keep you on your toes. It is a great suspense with creativity and an amazing plot that keeps the viewer interested the whole time. Psycho is about a woman named Marion Crane who is on the run for stealing $40,000 and while on the run she is encountered with well, a Psycho. This is a film the viewer needs to see for themselves and not ask any questions to a person who has seen it because the suspense is so great.The acting was well done in this film.  Janet Leigh who played Marion Crane had the most notable performance. She portrayed a sweet, but yet paranoid and guilty crook very well.  Anthony Perkins who played Norman Bates also did a great job portraying his character.What made this movie so amazing is the directing. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in film making. If it wasn't for him, horror films wouldn't be the way they are today. His techniques formed great suspense. The music he chose illustrated the anticipation of the film notably. Comparing this movie to the new version of Psycho which was made in 1998 is incredibly different. Even though the 1998 version was almost identical to the 1960s version, nothing compares to Alfred Hitchcock's version, proving that his techniques of using black and white film makes the film appear scarier. His original camera angles make him truly a great director that sets him apart from the other directors.This is a must see film! Though it is not the scariest movie out there the ingenuity of Psycho makes it one of the best horror films of all time. Psycho   was a definite trendsetter for current horror films.This movie is 10/10 stars.",Psycho

I definitely thought the shower scene was the best part, and I surely won't forget it.However, I think I agree with the rest of Psycho's audience by saying it is one of the most memorable scenes of all time.Hitchcock does an awesome job, in my opinion, with combining crime, sex and suspense, but that's nothing new. He takes an unreal and immortal topic to a realistic level. However, it is definitely not for the young ones! It's filled with blood and surprises but it's a definite must for those adult thrill seekers.",Psycho
780,aristotle61,Great Movie But..................,9,26 April 2019,"I'm not going to bother telling you what's great about this movie. You can look at the gazillion reviews here for that. Overall I would give the movie and 8.5 to 9.0.I'm going to use this review to make a few criticisms because no one seems to talk about that in their reviews. One of the recent reviewers had an interesting perspective. They thought that the movie dragged in the middle. I didn't see it that way. I thought the beginning was very weak. I didn't like it at all. The whole scene in the hotel room at the start was not entertaining in any way for me.There were a lot of little things in the movie that seemed silly to me.One of those was when Norman was clearing out the hotel room after the murder. The last thing he removed from the room was the newspaper that had almost $40,000 dollars in it. There is absolutely no way that someone could pick up a newspaper with all that money in it and not realize there was something in it. He would have needed to hold it together too in order to stop the money from falling out.Another was the camera work for the killing of the detective. I know Hitchcock is much admired for his camera work but the close up of Martin Balsam struggling to not fall backwards down the stairs looked ludicrous. In fact it looked very similar to a scene in another Hitchcock movie, Vertigo, except the scene in Vertigo wasn't this ridiculous. It took as much time for Balsam to fall down the stairs in this movie as it did for someone to fall from a tall building in Vertigo.The biggest problem with the movie by far was finding out that the mother had been dead for ten years and that Norman was himself and also acting as his mother because he had a split personality. One hour, ten minutes, and 27 seconds into the movie, bother Norman and his mother appear in the same scene. I never see where anyone ever mentions this. This is clearly an attempt to make you think that Norman isn't crazy and is not dressing up and acting as his own mother, but how do you justify this? Anyway, I would be interested in what anyone else has to say about this.",Psycho
781,martinjacob49,Hitchcock's Ultimate Masterpiece!,10,2 February 2014,"In the most legendary (and most imitated) film from ""The Master of Suspense"", Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, a chilling, disturbing, and crazy psychopath who causes terror to those who arrive at The Bates Motel. Originally released in 1960, Psycho's violence and implied sexual moments were the center of controversy, especially the now famous shower scene and the opening hotel love scene. While its definitely tame in today's standards, Psycho still manages to be filled with the ultimate suspense and thrills. Anthony Perkins shines as the notorious Norman Bates, and has a ton of maturity while doing it. With the excellent Perkins performance, a stirring and intense Bernard Herrmann score, and telling a horrific story that relies on suspense over gore, Psycho is the ultimate horror flick, and is the definitive film of the great Alfred Hitchcock.",Psycho
782,daniel-n-c180,spell-binding.,10,23 September 2016,"I know exactly how to go about this, I daresay. I'm gonna begin by clearing the air as regards one defining aspect of the movie, namely that it is black and white. Now, you can rest assured- the quality is impeccable, as there are lots of movies of lower quality out there; the cast, in addition,is top-notch.And I mean it. AAAnd the black-and- white thing , if anything, is a huge PERK. You heard me! it is an advantage, amounting, all in all, to the uncertain and suspenseful vibe that the movie conveys.Anyhow, I'm gonna be short and sweet as this is not a book review and nobody (at least I know for a thing that I detest them) really goes in for lengthy comments.The bottom line is that this tour-de-force is a must. A M U S T. and it isn't so because your teacher says so , or some haughty maven crows about it. It is because a friend says so- with a mere interest that people should watch art and good movies instead of preposterous time-wasters. This movie is the best psychological thriller I've ever seen( and certainly the great masterpiece people make it out to be). And there are a great deal of them. I'm not gonna ramble on about this, as there are a couple of movies that come close , but after pondering my choice well enough, I can assert that this is the best all-around, a cut above the competitors, and puts some of the nowadays tentative horror-things to shame, as the principles are timeless.Pick it, no second thoughts about it. I'm gonna say just this- this is even better than Fight Club, as it is better proportioned in terms of length-content , and needless to say other praiseworthy works such as American Psycho.",Psycho
783,nicole10221991,"the ""horror"" movie that changed everything!",10,27 April 2015,"i first watched this movie when i was nine years old and what stuck with me at that young age was the infamous shower scene. as i grew older (im 23 now) i appreciated the movie on many different levels. the first thing i will say is because of this well acted, well directed and nerve wracking film the horror movie genre was changed for the better. before Hitchcock came around there were horror monsters like Dracula and The Wolfman. Psycho gives us a look at a real threat, an average good looking man. Because of this movie that ""showed"" a woman being stabbed to death we now have all these other horror films from Friday the 13th to Saw. Psycho is the reason horror is what it is today. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates was absolutely fantastic! He is cute yet downright insane, something even today most people would look past. we have always wanted to believe that a killer looks gross, crazy or evil not good looking and Anthony Perkins gave us that. The ending is perhaps the greatest in horror history. when Vera miles finds the corpse of Mrs. bates in the cellar and Anthony Perkins appears dressed as his dead mother with a knife.. awesome! words really cant describe this movie, it is so much more than brilliant. it is technically the first slasher film and with good reason, you have mystery, murder and insanity! anyone who appreciates good horror and mystery should watch this, the acting is genuine, you really feel for the victim (janet leigh) and Norman Bates which is hard to do.

The film from the visual effect of speaking, for the audience is a can not forget the nightmare, and Hitchcock is the nightmare of genius maker.

I was fortunate to have avoided the ending of this film before seeing it and I can't be happier that I did. I enjoyed that twist and shock ending, it made perfect sense throughout the story and made the entire story so much creepier and unsettling.

789,voacor,Still Great (Spoilers galore),9,13 August 2006,"I was just flipping channels tonight and this was on. Even though I have seen it before, I just could not move on and became totally caught up in it. That was the genius of Hitchcock. The way the shots were framed, the way the story was laid out, the way the actors moved and talked-- it all works as an organic whole.We have a lot more knowledge of psychology today, or at least we think we do, but the shrink's little wrap-up talk at the end is still fascinating. One thing that probably is dated is the sinister/crazy look on the face of Norman Bates at the end. It works for the spooky effect and sends a chill up your spine, but real-life killers probably never show such ""mad"" expressions. Then again, the way Norman Bates is portrayed at the beginning is realistic, in that most people who meet mad killers so not detect anything unusual about them.John Gavin, who later abandoned acting and became US ambassador to Mexico, was the one stiff and unconvincing actor in this film. At his senate hearing, as I recall, he told the panel, ""I am not an actor and I have several films I can show you to prove it!""There were several great shots in this film beyond the famous shower scene that usually gets all the attention. The scariest single moment was the killing on the stairs. Then there is the swinging light and the skeletal face of the ""mother.""

790,rivardoman,Brilliant Classic!,10,28 March 2014,"It's hard to think of a thriller more well known than Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho! Unfortunately the films popularity may spoil the shock value. Upon seeing the film for the first time I thought knowing the outcome may make the experience less enjoyable. This was not the case! I now see why Psycho is considered masterpiece! Hitchcock is a master of suspense. As the film begins, the plot immediately makes the audience uncomfortable. As Marion Crane makes off with the money, I had no idea what would happen next. Hitchcock adds in various ideas that lead me astray and even stress me out. When the police officer was questioning Marion and began to follow her, I felt her anxiety. Also when she was rushing the car salesmen I felt uneasy. This is great film-making. The emotions that Hitchcock draws out don't exactly correspond with the direct plot. After all we haven't even met the infamous Norman Baits yet and already I am on the edge of my seat with anticipation.We arrive at Baits Motel as the rising action rolls into the main plot. What an astounding actor Anthony Perkins is! Perfect casting for a psychopathic mamma's boy! He is an actor that truly understands his role. When he peers through the hole in the wall, spying on Marion you can almost tell the moment when the mother personality clicks on. The only thing that I could have found more satisfying would have been if we saw Norman doing his mothers voice.I love Hitchcock's style. When Marion was stopped by the police officer the way he shot the actors close-up really gave me the impression of invaded personal space and added to my discomfort. He also had great techniques for moving the camera into may different positions without cutting. When the camera follows Norman Bates up the stairs to his mothers room the camera does a 360 as it climes and we are left with the perspective of a bug on the wall.Psycho is a classic horror/thriller that I will watch again. It provides an outstanding cast and fantastic cinematography. The timeless score that accompanies the film could not be any better.",Psycho

This is a movie that basically everyone in the United States of America has seen or will see, and it should be seen by every one its a great movie. But let's take a look at why it's so great. For starters Psycho is chock full of nerve tingling suspense that's probably one of the movie's greatest strengths. The suspense is handled so well by Alfred Hitchcock , after all the guy's nickname is the master of suspense. Other great strengths that this movie offers is it's amazing performance by it's lead actor Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, he plays a great character who has been broken by his mother to insanity. The rest of the cast does a fine job too especially Janet Leight. The movie is also full of so many twist and turns most of these are common knowledge now but back in 1960 no one knew what hit them. The music, we cant forget Bernard Herman's excellent music score that fits the tone of the movie perfectly, the music was most famously used in the shower scene now one of cinema's most recognizable moments.The twist ending is great it will catch you completely off guard. Psycho; a movie full of twists and turns, suspense at every corner, perfect music, great acting and all lead by probably the greatest film director of all times, Psycho does receive from me a 9.5 out of 10.

She tries to prevent to take Norman by women. The stuffing represents her. It likes a mask. Second, A toilet and an overflow of a bath expresses something. It is death and despair because it is pitch-dark within overflows. I pick up two hints. Final, I remember the mummy of Norman's mother. I like this movie.",Psycho

The best surprise ending ever unveiled. And the best Anthony Perkins film ever (although that isn't saying much).One of the most revolutionary films ever made, Psycho has so many thrills and shocks ever made. What might look like child's play to today's audience, must have completely blown away the minds of movie-goers from its time. Hitchcock throws caution to the wind and it pays off big time. What no other director would dare to put on screen, he does with surprising bluntness.To reveal Psycho's secrets to someone who hasn't seen it would be crime. The score of Herrman is the real star of the film that gives it a legendary status. No other film score has ever added more depth and intensity to propel a story.

796,tombeaman,Considered Great Cinema for a Reason,10,5 March 2004,"$40,000 and poverty.  Honesty and lies.  Infidelity, trust, and honor. Light and Darkness.  Black and white.  Life and death.  Freedom and traps. Sanity and psychosis.  Male and female.    Alfred Hitchcock studies each of these in Psycho.  In fact, it is the study of these dichotomies, these human conditions that make this thriller timeless and allow it to be considered a true classic.Each of us has human fallibilities.  It is the struggle between the perfectibility of man and the imperfection of the human condition that creates the traps that Norman Bates speaks of.  In the foretelling rendezvous in the office parlor, Marion and Norman focus on the human condition and how we each weave our own tangled webs.  In this scene, Hitchcock clearly shows the fragile female, using sinister lighting and superior camera angles to make her appear vulnerable and susceptible. Hitchcock pits her against the male on the prowl who is conflicted with his own demons and trapped, seemingly, by a traveler's hotel that gets no travelers.  Marion is uncomfortable, alone, and on the run straight into a trap of her own making; Norman is uncomfortable, alone, and trapped on what may as well be a dead-end road.  Norman is more than a hotelier; he is clearly the nervous suitor, fetching homemade sandwiches to feed the lovely visitor.  Marion is registered under a false name, believing that the police will catch her at any moment.  If only she were so lucky.When Norman reveals his sexual interest by peering through the hole in the wall, losing yet another struggle to be good, Marion is exposed at a time when each of us would be vulnerable: as we disrobe in an unknown environment, to prepare to rest from a long day.  As the characters lose the struggles that they are fighting, Hitchcock reveals more about ourselves than he does about Norman.Hitchcock's sense of pace throughout the movie, starting slowly and building to a climax, with various false summits along the way, are combined with the musical score to keep the audience attentive.  We find ourselves rooting for the adulterous embezzler, even after her fall from grace, partly because of her decision to extricate herself from her trap while there was still time. Our desire to find out who done it, even after Marion is no longer a part of the story, is a credit to the skillful manipulation of the audience, and of the realization that any of us could find ourselves in a similar predicament, and we would want justice to be served.  Thus Hitchcock is not just spilling blood to scare audiences, but to get us to appreciate our own contradictions and our freedom to choose which road we will travel, which trap we will set.",Psycho

Fast paced cuts between different views of the stabbing, with sound effects of the stabbing and the high pitched violin underscoring the whole scene. The scene also subverts expectations, as the character who was thought to be the protagonist dies and is replaced by another who the story develops around. The ending is another iconic moment as well. The character of Norman Bates is another thing that makes this movie so important and iconic. He subverts the role of a typical evil villain.

799,bunny_hater66,Love It......,9,7 October 2008,"One of the most famous movies of all time, and quite possibly influential horror film in history, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho traded the supernatural beings of the genres past Vampires, werewolves, zombies and the like for an all too human monster. The film made Norman Bates a household name and permanently guaranteed its director's status as the master of suspense.Psycho is a curious shocker devised by the master of suspense Hitchcock as a tease and received most critics as an unpleasant horror piece. After enormous commercial success it achieved classic status over the years, despite effective moments of fright, it has a childish plot and script and its interest is that of a tremendously successful confidence trick, made for very little money. Probably the most visual, most cinematic picture he has ever made. I think the film is a reflection of a most unpleasant mind, a mean, sly, sadistic mind.After many talks about a remake finally one come with Psycho in 1998 starring Julianne Moore, William H Macy and well. A terrible actor called Vince Vaughn. This version isn't a sacrilege, it's just pointless. To those who like the remake it is all very well having your tongue praising the film, but it does help having a brain in your skull. It also spawned two sequels and a TV series starring Lori Petty. The first sequel is a reasonably inventive sequel, if on the gory side. It probably holds the record for longest delayed follow up.The narrative is very unusual for its date of release as there are two separate narrative strands. The storyline firstly is from Marion stealing the money which is helped along with misleading the audience into believing that the patrolman and Marion will be a story about a girl who steals money. The film has influenced many other especially What Lies Beneath which is literally a Hitchcock Pastiche. I also like that it is black and white photography as the blood colour (red) was to gruesome to show in 1960. And also it was less budget. What I like about the film is that it lends to the horror genre like Silence Of The Lambs is that they have no actual supernatural undertones even slashers like Halloween and Friday The 13th have supernatural undertones; honestly how many times can you be shot and survive only to appear in another.The film is definitely one of my favourites. Like Spielberg's Jaws, Coppola's The Godfather, Lynch's Blue Velvet, this is his best film.",Psycho
800,Tha_rick-me,Screech!,10,18 January 2009,"Hitchcock is clearly the master of thrillers. This masterpiece shows the cooperation of thrills, a schizophrenic psycho and good dialog better than any other film.Some of the most iconic scenes are in this movie: the shower scene and the basement scene, to mention two of them. No movie has been aped so much as psycho, peering through a hole, hid behind a painting, shadows of the murderer looming up behind you, delightful plot twists, and yet such a great style.Camera's vanishing in the eye of a murdered woman, atmospherically depicted murder, the music, just, everything's great about this film. The final scene has been spooking in my mind for times, and, if you see this movie, you'll know why.10/10",Psycho
801,The_Stuff_of_Dreams,"Through ugliness, beauty is achieved",10,16 July 2009,"One would expect little from a film like this. In it, a psychopath murders people. It's pretty much as simple as that. There's back-story, of course, and the characters are three-dimensional, but otherwise, this is the typical thriller. However, it sets the standards for all thrillers to come after it. The exaggerated murder scenes and the music are two of the most copied horror techniques I have ever seen, and they originated in this film, and only in this film are they artistic. What sets this film apart from others in its genre is the fact that it is not all massacre. There's more suspense than anything else; impending doom. The murderer is not even the central character. A series of strokes of bad judgment from Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), the character who really stokes the fires, sparks a sinister chain of events. The people this chain of events involves are performed in such a way that they are real people thrust into a frightening situation, all strung together by the dark, confused thoughts of the title character, of the psycho. Interesting and masterful. Ten out of ten.",Psycho
802,cbrueggemeyer,One of those films that will never be forgotten,10,21 April 2011,"Psycho is easily one of the greatest movies of all time. It is made by the ""Master of Suspense"" Alfred Hitchcock, and it is commonly called his greatest work. That being said, most would think that this film already would be great, but great is an understatement as to how awesome this film is. The mix of great suspense, romance, and horror make this movie unique from every film every made. Four characteristics are listed to define a great suspense film: it has to be entertaining, the plot must be complex, it must be strongly visual, and the film must take place in a world beyond good and evil. I think that Psycho definitely has all of these characteristics. First off, I believe that Psycho is one of the most entertaining films ever created. The mix between action-packed, high intensity scenes and passionate, romance scenes make this movie as great as it is. This movie manages to be action packed even in this generation. Younger people who might be watching this for the first time are not going to see the kind of horror film they're accustomed to seeing. A generation back, most directors tended to build up characters and suspense, so there was a lot more storytelling and less action than you see today. Even so, Psycho still manages to be very entertaining and a lot of fun to watch.Secondly, I believe that the plot of Psycho is extremely complex, but not to the point where the audience is completely confused at the end. This films plot has many twists and turns, and it keeps you enthralled throughout the whole movie. One of the reasons why this movie is so complex is Hitchcock's use of ""pieces of plot"". Hitchcock leaves subtle clues around throughout the movie to suggest that they are the main focus of the movie: such as the $40,000 being left on Crane's dresser. These ""pieces of plot"" leave the audience confused as to what the main focus of the story is, and it perfectly sets them up as to what will happen later in the movie. This movies plot is entertaining and complex, and the ending only solidifies the argument that this is one of the greatest movies ever made. I believe that Psycho is strongly visual. Hitchcock, like many of the great directors of all time, employs the use of great visual imagery in this movie. For example, in the shower scene, one of the most famous scenes of all time, no words are spoken. However, the audience still completely understands what just went on in the movie. Hitchcock's telling of the story without the use of words makes this movie great, and many strongly visual scenes in this movie will be remembered as some of the greatest scenes in film history. Psycho definitely takes place in a world beyond good and evil. This movie is not just the simple, stereotypical story of woman goes missing, and people go to look for her. Throughout the movie, it becomes apparent that Hitchcock has way more planned for the audience than just a simple cop versus criminal. Bates is a breed of criminal almost never displayed in movies, a mentally disturbed killer. Bates is one of the best-displayed cases of a psychopath ever seen in film history, and the way he does his crimes exemplifies this. The Bates Hotel represents a place completely oblivious from the laws and punishments of society, a place where anything can happen. Given the evidence of all that happens in the movie Psycho, it becomes apparent that it is easily one of the greatest suspense films ever made. Psycho's uniqueness and overall intrigue made it an instant American classic. Many years from now, films like Psycho will be remembered as classic American films, and it is films like this that will never be forgotten.",Psycho
803,DocD456,Genius,9,20 February 2004,"This psychotic thiller is a work of genius by the director Alfred Hitchcock. Made in 1960 this film was well ahead of its time.  The movie stars Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, a curious motel manager, Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, John Gavin as Sam Loomis, and John McIntire as Sheriff Al Chambers.Psycho forever changed the way films were made in Hollywood.  Alfred Hitchcock's genius shaped this masterpiece in such a way to draw the viewer in and keeping them on the edge of their own seat.  With his experience in movie making, Hitchcock knows just how to influence and play with the mind.Alfred Hitchcock is considered `The Master of Suspense,' and has earned that name rightfully.  He created movies that one would have to watch over and over again in order to get all the little details of a film. Psycho is a perfect example of that, using lighting and camera angles to give the watcher a feeling of being anxious, scared, or weary of what is about to happen.  One might notice that when any certain scene is shown, the camera gets closer and closer to the actor or actress's face, making it very uncomfortable to watch.  Every aspect of this film is amazing for it's time, with a score that has been nominated to be one of the top 100 most influential pieces of music in American history. 
Overall, I give Psycho a 9 out of 10 stars, for being a good movie in general.  It's a powerful film that goes deeper than just scaring people. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves old horror classics.",Psycho
804,godfather199,Hitchcock At His Best,10,6 August 2005,"What can I say? What can anyone say? Psycho is the greatest horror/suspense film classic of all time. Mr. Hitchcock, the master of suspense, gave 1960 audiences, a film they would never forget. And the film started an industry of slasher films. I don't even know if the master knew the impact it would have in film history.Most of you reading this have seen the film, know the plot, and the surprise ending. So I won't bore you all with going over all of it. What I want to do is go over some of my personal feelings about the film, and my reaction when I first saw it on video, in the 80's. I was only a teen, but enjoyed classic movies. Especially this one.WARNING AGAIN-SPOILERS, for anyone out there that have not been lucky enough to see this masterpiece.The shower scene. I remember seeing the figure beyond the curtain, slowly move in. I put myself in the mind frame of a 1960 audience. When that shower curtain was pulled aside, and the figure appeared, along with the screeching music, I was terrified, but could not take my eyes of the screen. How brilliant was Hitchcock? To have his leading lady, star of the film, stabbed to death in the first 40 minutes of the movie. This left us, not knowing what to expect next. Anything could happen now. And a piece of info I learned on the shower scene. With all the brilliant editing, it had always been said, that the knife NEVER touched Marion's flesh. As I studied the scene in slow motion and frame by frame viewing, I found something. There's a shot of the knife going into the stomach of Marion. As I went frame by frame, I found, not only does the knife touch her stomach, but the tip of the knife penetrates the flesh. You can only see this if you have a VCR or DVD player, that can go frame by frame. Try it sometime.Arbogast- The murder of investigator, Arbogast, almost gave me a heart attack. I thought he'd creep into the house, maybe get some answers from Mrs. Bates, etc. But I guess I need not say what happens when he reaches the top of the stairs. My dad told me how he saw Psycho in the theater, when he was a teen in 1960. He said the Arbogast murder made him jump out of his seat, with his heart racing for the next five minutes. He says it was the biggest scare of any movie he's ever seen. I agree.Lila and Norman- This time I thought I had it figured out. Lila would get to Mrs. Bates, and get some answers. Wrong. When Lila goes down to the fruit celler, and finds the dead Mrs. Bates, chills ran through me. But then when Norman appears, dressed as his mother, with the insane look in his eyes, I got more chills than the flu. It finally sunk in. It all came together. That's what makes the film even more frightening to watch now. To know what went on in that old house, overlooking the motel. The madness, the horror, the evil. That's what went on in that house, years before Marion Crane stopped for the night. Pure madness. Pure evil. Pure insanity.Well, that's about it on my comments. The film is the greatest horror/suspense classic ever made. If you haven't seen it for a while, set aside a night, and watch it again. You'll enjoy it.V.M.""We all go a little mad, sometimes.""

805,lachlan-mcdougall,When is too much Hitchcock too much Hitchcock?,7,15 May 2014,"As always, Hitchcock has to be regarded as the consummate film-maker. Psycho builds upon his lavish traditions of suspense building, sly camera work, and jarring shocks delivering everything one wants from the great Auteur dabbling his toes in the waters of horror.The plot revolves around The Bates Motel in which the Freudian wet-dream of a proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) murders unsuspecting women out of some hazy, deep-seated love-hate relationship with his mother. Little more is really needed to form the set-up for an early example of what has come to be known as 'slasher flick'. Also, one doesn't want to give too much of the plot away while writing here as some (such as me until a few nights ago) have managed to avoid seeing this film so far.What I will talk about, however, is the fantastic camera-work that has gone into this film. Hitchcock makes expert use of his decision to produce this film in black and white (some claim he did it to reduce to the gore, others that he did it as a cost cutting measure) casting his demented antagonist in half shadows, highlighting his ambiguity of self and drawing the viewer into his dark, half-formed world of shadows and madness. The conversation scene between Bates and the beautiful Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), for example, is one of the most wonderfully awkward and subtly terrifying dialogue driven moments in the history of cinema, and, of course, no-one can forget the deftly handled and instantly recognisable shower scene.My issues with this film lie precisely and paradoxically in the things that make it so wonderful, however. I mean, Hitchcock's self-conscious and self-aware self-referentiality and toying with Truffaut's Auteur theories are wonderful as an exercise in film theory, but Psycho, at times, runs the risk of piling signature atop signature until it becomes somewhat a pastiche of Hitchcock's own style. The death of Marion so early in the piece, the bird motif, and the unbelieving policeman are all nice flourishes from a film-school perspective, but at the same time they come across as snide and self-important.Now, I won't criticise the man and his style too much, but I will say that Psycho is perhaps not the best example of Hitchcock's ability to weave high-art film-theory in with his genre fiction fantasies of murder and mayhem.Still though, Psycho is up there as one of the finest and earliest in the grand tradition of slasher horror, and as a genre film it really can't get enough kudos. Sharply directed, shot, and edited it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats thrilled to the max even a full fifty years after its initial release, and I imagine it will continue to be a favourite of many switched on film buffs for many, many years to come. An undeniable masterpiece of horror cinema, and a film that must be watched to truly become a part of cinema culture.",Psycho
806,J-Hargett,The best classic horror film to date,10,6 May 2016,"Psycho is without question in my mind, the most intrigued and best display of a thriller/horror film to date. Beginning with Alfred Hitchcock's iconic style, Psycho is a classic Hitchcock film in its anxious, innovative, voyeuristic, and suspenseful camera angles and movements. The film also has a great twist ending that Hitchcock often favored in his films. The voyeuristic camera angles gives the film suspense and anxiety as you feel like you're there watching the violence unfold. Hitchcock pushed the envelope of the time with Psycho and its inherent sex and violence which aids in its timelessness. The story is riveting and kept me engrossed through the films entirety. The events unfold in true Hitchcock fashion leading up to a brilliant climax with a compelling twist. Anthony Perkins' adept performance as the charismatic yet suspicious Norman Bates only aded to the film's grace and tact. Norman Bates' character development is amazing to watch as it is slowly fed to us little by little; as well as other characters such as Marion and Lila Crane, or Norma Bates. Psycho is a classic horror movie that defined the very essence of the horror and psychological thriller genre. It is a film i throughly enjoyed and will continue to enjoy as it is highly re-watchable to me. The film is just simply, perfectly executed.",Psycho

808,walrus-5,We all go a little mad sometimes.,10,29 January 1999,"Can anyone not be frightened by this masterpiece? It's being almost 40 years since the release of this Hitchcock classic, and it's still scary. And it's not just scary, it's also revolutionary and intelligent, like no one else can do. Alfred Hitchcock gives us a perfect technical motion picture, in the camera movements, cinematography, editing (how can you not get thrilled in the shower scene) and special effects, with a surprising and inspired screenplay, that keeps the viewer hypnotized the whole length of the film, a music score that matches the film perfectly, a display of the human experience, with greed, betrayal, sexuality, repression, morality, insanity, instinct, desire, violence, motherhood and passion, and outstanding performances by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, without mentioning the rest of the cast, which is great too. This is just a few comments on one of my top 5 films of all time, but now I gotta go. Need to take a shower.",Psycho
809,witch king,A mind is a terrible thing to lose,10,22 October 1998,"The psychological threads of the film are so complex as to be nearly inexhaustible; this feature alone contributes to its place in film history as one of the great celluloid efforts of all time. Like any genuine work of true genius, it may be enjoyed on more than one level. Alfred Hitchcock forced film-goers to confront head-on just a few of the shadowy corners of the human psyche: the Oedipus/Elektra complexes, jealousy about sexual perceived sexual] rights, guilt, and self-hatred [as in Norman's cross-dresssing], to cite just a few examples of neurotic behavior. Perhaps the most frightening interpretation of the film is that one is responsible for one's actions and cannot, ever, alter the designated course a particular act has set in motion. Here, it is Marion Crane's decision to steal the $40 grand from her employer in order to race to Fairvale to be with her [illicit] lover, Sam Loomis. The opening vista, a bleak mountain and desert landscape over Phoenix [note the metaphor for both the geographical location and the town's name], is replete with the futility of the lovers ever forging a permanent bond with one another. The film is a terrific essay of human desperation and its stray threads: the hunger for sex, for a safe haven, for an ascendant place in one's tiny universe. The barrenness of the emotional landscape is shiveringly mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's shrill, spiky score, which speaks of the desolation of all humankind. Both murders are violent acts of mutilation and hatred, one thinks, not only for the victims, but also for the perpetrator. Fittingly, the killer's ""cleansing"" ritual takes place in a swamp, the normal repository for all kinds of secrets and unclean, dangerous organisms lurking beneath the stagnant surface. Finally, I found most interesting the title on the record label on the turntable in Norman's room: Beethoven's Eroica Symphony [No. 3]. This majestic, noble work bears no resemblance to the music one would justly associate with the tormented mind of young Bates. One can only guess that the boy's impressionable mind was at one time quite normal and receptive to elevated experiences such as a hearing of this great work of Beethoven's, but that jealousy, perhaps having been spurred by an intimacy with his mother, drove the boy to madness. Guilt, one of the human being's great purgatives, finds no outlet here, as we see in Norman's feral smile at the film's end. Hitchcock's use of mirrors works wonderful psychological tricks upon us, forcing us to wonder if what we see in our real and fancied mirrors, is real.",Psycho
810,a-hardaker-03394,One of Hitchcock's Best,10,14 December 2019,"Psycho is a classic Alfred Hitchcock film, the suspense and thrill I felt watching this movie was great. This film has great suspense while not going into the horror genre. The editing and camera cuts to different angles really builds the suspense. This music used in the film really deepens the eerie feeling you get while watching. This movie shows Hitchcock at his finest, the shower scene is now iconic and the twists and turns in the plot make this movie unpredictable in the best way.",Psycho
811,ken-243,The best of the Hitchcock canon,10,30 June 2001,"Probably the best of all of the Hitchcock films, mostly due to the surprise mid-film demise of the film's main character.  The basic problem with any suspense film is the audience can be secure in the knowledge that the big-name star will survive the film--somehow. Psycho breaks this tradition and throws the audience a completely unexpected curve. Psycho also demonstrates what a good director can do with a low budget and, basically, a one-set picture.  Good performances all around, particularly from Perkins. Nearly a perfect piece of cinema, marred only by occasionally sloppy editing and a few unfair red herrings, such as using an actress (Virginia Gregg) as the voice of ""mother"" instead of having Perkins do it. Brilliant Bernard Herrmann score uses only strings. Title sequences by Saul Bass seamlessly set-up the story. Would-be horror film directors need to thoroughly understand what makes this film a masterpiece before they shoot their first frame of film. There is almost no blood or on-screen violence.",Psycho
812,om926,Eerie,7,13 December 2009,"Right off the bat the viewer is immediately mesmerized and engulfed in the film as it begins with classic, intense Hitchcock music which I really loved. Psycho has great camera-work, fitting music and perfect sound. I specifically like the car scene in the beginning when the camera seemed to be fixed on the hood of the car it just looked awesome. The music always fits the scenes throughout the film however, my favorite was probably the shower scene. There were pretty good effects in the movie as well like the rain scenes for example. I thought Janet Leigh was amazing; everything from her body gestures (for example the movement of her hands when she was originally driving and being followed by a car showing her nervousness) and just her overall sense of panic (when she's at the car dealership and is being watched by the cop). I really enjoyed the sound as well, especially in Marion's car ride after she changes cars and you can hear the voices of people the cop is questioning, etc. The film is incredibly suspenseful especially in the car ride when it starts to rain and she can't see anymore; you're on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen. The shower scene is an absolute classic. It's so real yet at the same time so fake, you never even see her getting stabbed and the lack of blood was a little unrealistic. I felt like the only other two scenes that lacked some realism was the staircase scene, and the fact that there was conveniently a swamp right across the motel for Norman to dispose of cars and bodies. The lighting in the film was also really good with a balance of light and dark scenes. Overall, the movie is pretty good and it has its twists and is a little creepy and scary at times. However, in the end, I honestly don't feel like this movie deserves #22 on the top 250. I think The Shining, even though it was 20 years later, tops this movie in the ""horror scale"" but that's just me. Regardless, this is definitely a classic and a great movie.",Psycho
813,ShanghaichickS,FABULOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,10,20 February 2004,"For being known as the `Master of suspense' Hitchcock is definitely successful to fulfill the title he has been given. Psycho wasn't exactly a horrifying experience, however for its time is was quit a spooky film. The techniques used for lighting, camera angle, and music are absolutely phenomenal and very powerful.	For example in one scene of this film, the main character is driving her car and the camera is angled at her face head on. The lighting outside of the car is gloomy and somewhat dark, and the music was extremely intense. The entire mood and atmosphere of this scene made everyone migrate to the edge of their seat, and their knuckles white from gripping their arm rests.	Also very powerful, and wise, was the symbolism that Hitchcock used throughout this film. For example in the beginning we see the main character sleeping with a man in her hotel room. She is clothes with a white skirt, and a white bra. A few scenes later, after she has commited a robbery, she is back in her hotel room wearing a black skirt and a black bra. The fact that she has just commited a sin, and is now dressed in black, is a great example of powerful symolism. 	The camera work was most definetly phenomenal. Part of the movie takes place in or at a hotel complex, and the house that the owner lives out is at the top of a little hill right behind the hotel. The house looks incredibly frightening but the angle that the camera shoots at makes it even more scary, and definetly gives you the chills. 
	I do not wish to get into any more detail regarding this film, because I don't want to spoil it for the viewer. However, I would definitely suggest watching psycho. I have yet to hear of anyone who is not satisfied with this film, and I doubt that I ever will. I rate this movie at a 10 for being 100% extraordinary!!! I suggest it to anyone wanting a good spook, or even just someone who enjoys watching brilliant writing put into motion and displayed through this wonderful and enjoyable movie!",Psycho
814,eyeluvhotboyz,The Master of Suspense?... yea he really is,9,20 February 2004,"Psycho is a fantastic movie, mainly for those who love the details of movies.  The director, Alfred Hitchcock, was the first that did what people would call a `horror movie.'   Using camera angles, music, and voices in a person's head, he creates a truly suspenseful movie.First, he creates suspense by having voices in the character's head.  These are the voices of people that the character knows.  They generally are saying things that may be going on while the character is not there.Then he adds some camera angles.  During a time when the main character is scared Hitchcock will show the face, then quickly, move to something else. Then, when he returns to the character, the shot it much closer to the character's face.  After a few repeated times of doing this, the camera is uncomfortably close to the actor/actress' face.  Lastly, he adds the final touch; loud, clashing, orchestral music.  Music in a film can really alter the viewer's mood.  This music definitely adds to the suspense.If I were to rate this movie on a scale of one to ten (ten being great), I would give this movie a 9.5.  It is a fantastic movie that many people could enjoy.",Psycho
815,OutlanderOmega,F#ck Psycho,6,5 April 2015,"Hitchcock may be one of the greats, but that's no excuse for doing sub par work and making a half-good movie. You can't do that, man. What reasons do I have for assaulting a classic? It's 1 in the morning, I'm not wearing pants, I have insomnia as a result of depression, and I thought that Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece make-you-wet-your-adult- diaper thriller was a load of horse manure.I first saw Psycho with my family one Halloween. I expected what the DVD case said: a thriller. What I got was not much in return. The story follows Marion Something who decides to rob her perfectly nice boss and go on the run with the money. Why? Doesn't matter. She is then pursued by a theorizing cop for a wholesome round of filler suspense. I wasn't embroiled in her life. I was bored. She then stops at a motel and after a long bout of small talk with the creepy care-taker, is murdered. I haven't marked this as a spoiler because it isn't one. It barely happens halfway through.I don't give a flying, enchanted sh!t about shocking the audience if it removes the stupid main character from the stupid movie. The rest of the movie is a detective (about whom I saw no reason to care) looking into Marion's disappearance and ultimately the wacky misadventures of Marion's sister and Marion's butt buddy Sam. THIS WEBSITE lists Marion as fourth in the cast and I'm expected to pay attention. I found myself disengaged from the story. I blame the screenplay. Upon closer inspection and after a second, forced viewing in film class, I saw that there was still three-act structure and an antagonist. There's even the first conflict between the protagonist and primary opposition at the middle as Dan Decker states in Anatomy of a Screenplay. I was still not interested and a movie can be uninteresting if it follows some of the rules. Ask yourself this: how much is actually known about Marion, Lila, or Sam?Psycho was expertly directed, shot, and edited. The shower scene lived up to its expectations. The ending was creepy and plot-twisty enough for me. But for all that, I still found that I didn't care. I hated this movie and the positive qualities didn't come up past the area that failed and is most important to me: story.",Psycho
816,gus81,"If there is one single film that can claim to be THE best of all time, then this is it....",10,6 March 2005,"*POSSIBLE SPOILERS*, if there can be in a film as famous as this....Psycho probably has the most famous (and/or infamous) scene in the history of movies - the shower scene. The shower is in the Bates motel, run by Norman Bates, and his 'mother'. Even today, if someone looks freaky, many still say he looks like Norman Bates. If someone has a clingy or naggy mother, many a Norman Bates allusion is referred to. Psycho has become etched into modern culture and become a household name. Why?...because the film was a milestone, not just of gore, but of cinematic effect and technique. Psycho is, all at the same time, taut, mesmerising and terrifying. It is a textbook example of how to captivate an audience, and then shock them right at the very end.The film starts by introducing a love-lorn and frustrated heroine, complete with a dead-end job, and a relationship that needs a jump start. The audience is introduced to her and her troubles; we follow her, and feel for her - then she is murdered right in front of us. The array of characters introduced in the first half of the film - the arrogant 'Texan' guy who flashes forty thousand dollars, the bumbling boss, the suspicious highway cop, the dumbfounded used-car salesman - all amount to nothing. This pioneering change in plot has the same effect as a tree which you collide with after pulling up the handbrake on a speeding car.Then enter Milton Arbogast, the private detective who begins the search for our slain heroin Marion Crane. He investigates the Bates Motel and finds something amiss. He reports the news to the worried boyfriend and sister of Ms Crane - they all develop some trust and repartee. Then he's dead. Then enter the local town cop who doesn't believe the boyfriend's and the sister's suspicions, while all the time the audience knows what really happened and why people are dying at the hands of an 'evil old lady' who the disturbed Norman Bates is desperate to protect.The whole film was a totally new way of writing a plot, and of manipulating a storyline. The supposed lead character is killed early on, a replacement protagonist suffers the same fate; and all the audience are then left with are the utterly desperate and confused Lila Crane (sister) and Sam Loomis (boyfriend), who have only their suspicions and fear to drive them toward finding the truth. The audience feels for them, because we know that Norman's mother murdered Marion Crane.....or at least we think we do.Psycho only runs for around an hour and a half. It is the tautest thriller I've ever seen. Not one scene is wasted on being filler. Each scene is purposeful, powerful, and extremely economical. The pace is cracking when it needs to be, and slow and hypnotic when emotion and fear need to be emphasised; note the long scene as Norman Bates cleans up the murder scene - this allows the horror of what just happen sink in.The script is rattling, with some flourishing dialogue that even overshadows some wooden acting from John Gavin. The cinematography is brilliant, with great use of lighting and shadows. And, of course, the directing is just simply cutting edge, even for today. Anthony Perkins does a perfectly chilling job as the psychotic Norman Bates, and Martin Balsam is a completely natural private eye. And famously, to complement these ground-breaking plot twists, are the chilling and perfectly executed murder scenes.And finally, the chilling revelation of what really happened at the Bates Motel is kept right until the blood-curdling end, and is realised through a ear-splitting scream, a rotting skull, and a naked swinging lightbulb; a scene which leaves the audience shocked, terrified and thrilled after such a roller-coaster of a movie. For those few people to whom the 'spoliers' warning at the start of this piece applies, go and rent this film. It is simply a must for everyone. It is a defining moment of modern popular culture, and as such if there ever was a convincing candidate for the greatest movie ever made title, well then this is it.",Psycho

The key to ""Psycho"" is that it came out nearly 50 years ago and while viewing the film one should keep this in mind. Most of the surprises and tricks we take for granted today were at one point something totally new and different. Writers so often steal and copy ideas from others that everything becomes predictable--in fact, that is the major problem with today's horror flick: the viewer knows exactly what is going to happen. However, ""Psycho"" is sort of a first cause, it's a film that stole nothing yet inspired everything. Of course, to watch the ""Psycho"" in this day and age isn't nearly as exciting as it would have been back in 1960. But as I stated, in order to truly appreciate Hitchcock's genius one has to put himself back in a theatre during ""Psycho's"" release.The film begins with a young woman, Marion Crane (Leigh). She seems like a respectable girl, but she soon falls to temptation and steals forty thousand dollars from her employer. After this she immediately leaves town and heads towards California. Before she reaches her destination she must first take a night's rest at a roadside motel, the Bates Motel, and here begins our descent into the darkness. At the dilapidated motel, Marion meets the owner, Norman Bates (played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins), and they even have a nice dinner together. Hitchcock has set up the perfect thriller; he dupes us into believing this film is now going to somehow center on Marion and Norman, and in a way it does, but not in the way we anticipate. Hitch starts this film as a classic ""cat and mouse"" game: girl steal money, cops try to get money back. But all of our expectations are shattered as Marion is brutally stabbed to death while she is taking a shower in her motel room. We even discover that the perpetrator is Norman's crazy mother.Marion may be dead, but her crime is well enough alive. A private investigator (Martin Balsam) (hired by Marion's sister and boyfriend)is on her tail, and traces her to the Bates motel. He too meets and untimely death, and once again we are astounded. Hitchcock not only killed his main character, but now he has killed a cop. We are held in complete suspense; we know that Hitch is not afraid to kill anyone, and that means anything can happen. This is the kind of remarkable and groundbreaking stuff I was talking about. No other director before Hitchcock was as brazen as to knock off the female lead (and certainly not while she was naked in the shower). Could you imagine seeing this for the first time?Soon enough Marion's sister (Vera Miles) and boyfriend (John Gavin) decide to go find her themselves. They want to convince Marion to turn herself in so she may receive a lesser penalty for her crime. Right before the private investigator was murdered by Momma Bates, he told them that he had traced Marion to the Bates Motel, and thus the two of them head off to the hellhole. Shortly after this point the film ends, and what an end it is! Hitchcock has set us up for one of the most suspenseful, disturbing, and surprising conclusions in cinematic history. I can only imagine how incredible this experience would have been back in 1960, but alas, ""Psycho's"" ending is hardly a secret anymore and some of its more shocking moments are not nearly as jaw-dropping in this modern age. However, that doesn't change the fact that ""Psycho"" spawned the modern horror genre and gave us some of Hitchcock's best cinematography.We have been exposed to almost fifty years of copycats since ""Psycho"" and because of this I think we have forgotten just how amazing the original was. It is like living in Arizona: one sees the sun so often he forgets how glorious it was when he first moved there. So yes, ""Pyscho"" may seem a bit dated, but that isn't the films fault; that is our fault--we have seen to many duplicates. I will also admit that ""Pyscho"" doesn't really have much of a message (well, unless one counts the film's brief mention of how people create ""traps"" for themselves). However, this movie's goal is not to preach, but to scare and surprise, and I believe it succeeds wonderfully in this area (so long as we can imagine ourselves in a 1960's theatre). ""Pyscho"" is not only a part of American culture, but a milestone in American film-making, and probably Hitchcock's greatest achievement. For all these reasons and them some, I give ""Psycho"": 5 out of 5 stars.",Psycho
818,y-melon0326,surprising,7,16 September 2014,"I cannot decide whether Psycho is good film or not. It is easy to understand the story of this film but a word and existence of psychopath has been spread by this film and it has made the world that allows to reduce a punishment because of psychopath. While I was watching this film, I was frightened because I felt as if I would be killed by someone. In other words, I feel realism when I watch this film. One thing which has us felt realism is camera-work and sound effects. For example, Hitchcock connected a lot of short scenes without a break, which is called montage. It relieves tension of frightening and also a monochrome relieves it too. While Hitchcock removes scares a little, he leaves some fright points. Another thing is angles. In this film, a main character is not decided, so the story is described by a few people' angle and our sympathies for the person who is described mainly then are switched immediately. Finally, I'll mention about the whole picture of this film. I think this film is composed of three parts. As I mentioned before, the main character is not set clearly so our sympathies change quickly. I think the main character is Norman. In the first part, Marion is described mainly, however, she is not the main character any more in the after parts. After that, the main is Norman. I don't know the meaning of the first part. I wonder Hitchcock can make it more surprising.",Psycho

822,Greg Lord,A touching tale of a young man & his mother,10,2 May 2000,"CAUTION: MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSIt's hard to realise the magnitude of Hitchcock's achievement with this film with the handicap of hindsight; I wish I could somehow erase all knowledge of it from my mind so I could view it as if for the first time: I think only then could I appreciate just how revolutionary & subversive this film really is.It seems Hitchcock deliberately set out to change the film-going habits of the Western world, & it also seems that he succeeded. Apparently when it was made (1960) filmgoers were in the habit of wandering in & out of films at the theatre irrespective of the film's starting & finishing times. Trailers for Psycho' blazed the message: ""Make sure you watch this film from the beginning"". Those who heeded this advice could have been forgiven for wondering why: a young woman (Janet Leigh) steals a large sum of money from a business partner of her employer. On the road, she stops at the Bates Motel in order to divert attention from a suspicious cop, & with her boyfriend, her sister & a private detective also on her trail. The proprietor is one Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who, although a little edgy, seems basically OK  apart from a slight maternal fixation. What's the big deal , they might ask  psychological drama, girl on the run etc. etc.: so far, so Hitchcock. After chatting with Bates for a while she retires to her room for a shower, which in hindsight was probably not such a good ideaIn an age when Hollywood was still largely dominated by the star system, half an hour into the movie Hitchcock takes his main lead - an attractive, curvaceous blonde - & kills her off, & with a savagery rarely portrayed on the big screen. He then takes what seemed like a fairly conventional movie & turns it on it's head. No longer is the lead character an attractive yet vulnerable young woman on the run, it is now a twitchy nervous antithesis of a Hollywood or even a Hitchcockian leading man (i.e. Cary Grant, James Stewart, Gregory Peck); no longer is the film a run-of-the-mill crime thriller, it is now a journey into the mind of a madman.I have heard that Hitchcock himself regarded this film as a comedy, & although I've never seen it this way myself I wonder if this is where for him the humour lies: the delight of taking accepted movie conventions, turning them upside-down & inside-out & yet still producing a hugely successful blockbuster by mangling all the rules. I'm sure it made him laugh anyway!Mention has to be made of Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates - he is simply magnificent & puts in one of cinema's greatest performances. His representation of an unhinged madman masquerading as normal is brilliantly done & totally believable: his desperate attempts at normal behaviour & conversation are overlaid with a nervy touchiness; & his twitchy, constantly changing facial expressions make it clear before you know anything more about him that you're looking at a man torn with internal conflict. He delivers lines such as Mother isn't quite herself today' with a superb drollness that is somehow also loaded with hidden meaning, & in hindsight also quite funny. The end scene where we finally see Norman in his true colours done by anyone else would just look silly (i.e. the recent remake) but he makes it extremely chilling  for me one of cinema's great scenes.The directorial craftmanship is equally suberb: who else but Hitchcock could come up with anything like the famous shower scene? Shot over 7 days using 70 different camera set-ups for a minute or so of a naked girl being stabbed in a shower - & yet not once is there visible any of the girl's naughty bits' or of the knife plunging into her flesh, such was the attention to detail. In my opinion it probably still is the greatest cinematic sequence ever made.The scripting, the cinematography, the acting, the sets, but particularly it's subversive delight in turning conventionality on it's head to stunning effect make this film a masterpiece by any standards, a description that still applies 40 years later & I think will do for generations to come.",Psycho
823,j-howard-91663,Psycho Analysis,10,22 April 2020,"Cinematography and lighting of the film are well done; because of the angle of the camera and shadows cast by the light, it's hard to tell that Norman is the murderer dressed up as his mother. In the two murder scenes, you can only make out the female hairstyle and feminine clothing of an older woman, making the audience assume that Norman's mom is the murderer.The use of non-diegetic music throughout the movie adds immersion and suspense to what's happening in the scene. An example of this was when Arbogast was murdered in the house, for the last few minutes of that scene, suspenseful music was played, adding into the build-up. All of a sudden, the music becomes loud and intense, similarly to the action in the scene. It's even used to share the emotional energy of characters to the audience. This is felt when Marion is trying to leave the city with the money she's stolen. You can feel the rush of anxiety that Marion is experiencing as she locked eyes with her boss. This moment along with the fast and loud music playing, expresses the ""oh no"" moment Marion is having.",Psycho
824,patrickbateman-84347,A boy's best friend is his mother.,9,16 January 2021,This is a MASTERPIECE Anthony Perkins is a great actor and the role of Norman Bates was a huge success and how the character evolves through out the movie is great. I really liked that Hitchcock killed the main protagonist( in the famous shower scene) and the second half of the movie is about how the death of Marion Crane affects everyone. The end-twist that Norman is actually his mother was insane - I didn't like the ending explanation however - . Janet Leigh was excellent in the whole movie aswell as the Private Investigator(Martin Balsam). Music was through the roof however from all the uses of that music in the rest of the films after that I was almost laughing when it was playing.It was really a great movie,Psycho
825,kevinmanf,A disturbing masterwork,10,13 March 2006,"In most films we participate as passive voyeurs. Not in Psycho which is a brilliant study of suspense, horror, paranoia, mood and evil hidden under a mask of innocence. From its very beginning to its shocking and ironic ending, we have Alfred Hitchcock directing the audience and in his own words, playing the audience ""like a piano""  leading us exactly where he wants. To call this a chilling masterpiece is a cliché but it is no further from the truth.The film is filled with unforgettable sequences. From Marion's (Janet Leigh) escape always with the company of the police that seems to be following her  a great way of sinking us into Marion's paranoia to her arrival at Bate's Motel where we the audience believe are safe from all danger; the conversation Marion maintains with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) about his hobbie as a taxidermist; and of course, the shocking shower sequence. The horror of this scene comes from the fact that it takes part at a moment of extreme intimacy and vulnerability and also due to Hitchcock's craftsmanship: the screeching violin and the camera which does not focus on the wounds the stabbing causes but rather, leaves it to our imagination which is much more effective than any graphical representation. But even before we arrive at the famous Bate's Motel, where the key events take place, Psycho already feels disturbing perhaps because we fear for Crane's plight, perhaps because of the chilling score, perhaps because we fear the police's intentions, perhaps because Hitchcock gives us minimal vistas except those of suspicion therefore we feel trapped in Crane's guilt and paranoia. Whatever the reason, Psycho has already established itself as a film that is more than anything else about our paranoia and uneasy feelings.Another key element is Hitchcock's character control. We never expect the death of Marion (the film's main character) so early on. But what could have been a dangerous move is handled brilliantly as Hitchcock shifts our sympathy from Crane to Bates so that when he attempts to sink he care, we fear for him (we know that if the car does not sink we will be jabbed by fear and we also feel that Bates is too innocent a character, to suspicious a person that he would inevitably be accused of the crime if the car is discovered), just as much as we feared for Crane. The performances are worthy of mentioning especially Anthony Perkins who embodies innocence but at the same time, a disturbing presence. The ending, a close-up of Crane's assassin is chilling, highlighting this character's evil.The genius of this film is that it is always in full control of the audience, always feels visceral and chilling. We are lead to feel disturbed and uneasy even when there is nothing visible on screen to disturb us.",Psycho
826,blippster,The most suspenseful film I have ever seen. A classic.,10,1 October 2008,"Alfred Hitchcock famously said: ""There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it."" I think that what Hitchcock meant by the line is that a moment in a movie that is considered 'scary', such as a murder or a stabbing, is not scary at all on its own; it is the lead-up to and anticipation of it that is scary. I agree with this statement, especially in the case of 'Psycho'. The murder scenes in 'Psycho' are very sub-par by today's standards, in that you don't see much blood (and the blood you do see isn't very vivid, as it is black and white), and in one stabbing scene, you don't even see the knife penetrate the victim's flesh. The murder scenes are also obviously fake, and by today's standards of gore, are almost laughable.However, these negative points boil down to almost nothing when you compare it with the positive points in ""Psycho"", and I believe that some of the biggest positive points of the movie were the extremely well made suspense sequences, especially the scene where Lila Crane is in the house at the end. Alfred Hitchcock is known as ""The Master of Suspense"" and these scenes are a very good example of why he is called that. As Hitchcock said, the terror is in the suspense. In this movie, there are only three sequences which could be defined as ""violent"", although, because of the heart-pumping terror of the suspense scenes, ""Psycho"" is, for me, one of the scariest movies I've seen.When comparing ""Psycho"" to new horror movies, ""Psycho"" wins hands down. While most modern horror movies are infinitely more violent than ""Psycho"", none of them seem to have the same gripping, heart-wrenching feeling because of their lack of suspense. With most new horror movies I have seen, such as ""Saw"" the movie didn't really get much scarier after the first bit of violence. For ""Psycho"", the effect was almost opposite, and the lack of violence was, in fact, one of the movies strengths.I would say that ""Psycho"" is what a real horror movie is. When making a horror movie, one should focus less on the gore, and take a page out of Hitchcock's book by focusing on the suspense.A solid 10/10!",Psycho

828,BovieMuff-91,All-time classic,10,7 August 2010,"I have seen just one other Hitchcock movie before this one, and this review is from the point of view of a relative beginner. Not to Hollywood in general (fortunately!), but to Hitchcock.The first thing that struck me about this film was how often it has been used as inspiration for the dozen horror-flicks of today. Most of the 21st-century horror flicks concentrate solely on 'scaring' the viewer, and don't give two-hoots about the story (or rather the lack of it), and performances from the so-called 'actors'. The most common sound you will come across in these movies is 'AAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!!' Whereas in Psycho, every performance is memorable, especially that of Anthony Perkins. Not to forget the cunning Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh.The second (and probably the most important) thing that struck me was the brilliant camera-work and sound-effects. The ""film"" experience this movie generated (even if you watch it at home on the computer) was something I hadn't experienced in a long time. During the second murder, the immediate change of camera and (EXTREMELY) loud sound, really gave me the shivers! To conclude, I can safely say this movie will always be on my personal top 3. 10/10P.S: would also like to add, i'd prefer watching psycho for even the 10th time than watch any of the horror movies of today.. in spite of the special effects.. :)",Psycho
829,TheMulderFox,A Masterstroke - Psycho is simply brilliant,9,6 July 2013,"What can I say about Hitchcock that hasn't already been said so many times before? The man was an absolute genius and I adore his work. And just to get it all out of the way I love Psycho, just in case that wasn't already clear.In the late '50's and early '60's there was a flurry of low budget, mostly B&W horror/thriller/suspense movies made. Think the work of Wiliam Castle(The Tingler, House on Haunted Hill, Macabre)as an example. These proved mostly very popular with audiences, and it was this trend that sparked Hitchcock to try his hand at the same formula. The result was Psycho.(as a side note William Castle in turn made ""Strait-Jacket"" as a direct response to Psycho) The true strength of Psycho, for me, lies not in the Famous Shower scene or the brief outbursts of violence(few as they are) heightened by Bernard Herrmann's now signature score. The true strength of this film lies in the casting of Antony Perkins and Janet Leigh. They portray their respective characters perfectly. Watching the subtle nuances in their performances, the minor changes in expression, the inflections and tone of voice is just fascinating. There simply is no Norman Bates without Anthony Perkins.Even to the very last scene Psycho keeps you enthralled where the big pay-off of the story is not stereotypically the apprehension of a maniac(or psychopath if you will)or the solving of a crime with the comforting knowledge that all is well again. Instead it comes with the realisation of just how far down the rabbit hole you've truly gone, and that ""Norman Bates"" can be anyone or anywhere. Be it the unassuming shy owner of a roadside motel or even your neighbour.Psycho is simply a must see picture.",Psycho
830,slugbelle,"Combination technique, directing, and acting make psycho worth the scary parts.",8,19 February 2004,"Alfred Hitchcock shows massive skill in the overall display of his film, Psycho.  Using almost all new views and carefully plotted signs, the ""Master of Suspense"" was one of the first to use dark plots to entice his audiences. Psycho is what would now be considered a lot less than terrifying; with thousands of movies out frightening viewers, a movie from the 1960's wouldn't seem like such a big deal.  Psycho is the number one prototype of scary movies, the movies seen today use ideas and camera angles that Alfred Hitchcock mastered.  The design of the movie is to make the audience uncomfortable; and by using intense orchestral music and close-ups on the emotion of the characters the director accomplishes that goal.  The plot starts out simple and assumingly bland, and what is amazing is that Alfred Hitchcock used such a simple story that could be told in minutes and reformed it into one of the best thrillers of all time.  Combined with the acting Psycho is crucial to the movie industry itself, the characters themselves are outlined wonderfully and add a sense of anxiousness essential to the script.  The movie takes more than one watching, but should be seen by a diverse group of people.  It is a good movie and can therefore be enjoyed by an indifferent audience, while serious moviegoers could also enjoy its subtle hints and background scenes.  From young ages to old, the value of the movie stays mainly constant; it really depends on the opinion of the viewer for that particular genre.  What makes Psycho unique is that even the most frightened person can see the worth of it, if that person gets up enough courage to stick with it.",Psycho
831,Theshapeo31,Rarely any horror film in my opinion as ever toped this,10,13 August 2012,"There have only been a small handful of horror films (in my option) to have toped Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" (The Shining & Halloween I & II). Well what can I say about this timeless classic? Nothing really but I'll try. But first I HAVE to start off by saying that Alfred Hitchcock truly is the master of suspense and this truly is his masterpiece and he has had MANY great films and a handful of them have made Damian's Top 250 Movies of All-Time (The Birds, Vertigo, & Rear Window to name a few). But anyway there's nothing I can really think of to say about this film so I'll have to go into the story which EVERYONE knows.The story starts off with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her boyfriend waking up after an afternoon of sex. Then she goes to work and has to drop off $40,000 at the bank (also with inflammation that's A lot of cash almost or about $250,000 in America's currency). But she decides to runaway with it and stops for the night at Bates Motel where she meets nervous but the seemingly gentle Norman Bates who keeps her company and has dinner with her and gives his famous ""A boys best friend is his mother speech"". Then after that we ALL knows what happens next Marion goes to take a shower and the famous ""shower scene"" happens (and I could imagine how it was for people in theatres). So after she's killed by what was seemingly Norman's mother Norman finds her dead body and cleans up the bathroom and puts her body into her car and pushes it into quicksand. So then the second half of the film is basically Marion's sister, boyfriends & detective Abergast trying to find her but he's killed and the. They find that Norman's mother is skeleton and the one that's supposedly ""Norman's Mother"" is Norman himself!!!! So they apprehend him and Norman is taken away and the film ends there.Now like I said Alfred Hitchcock (may he rest in peace) truly is the master of suspense and this really is his masterpiece and my favorite of all of his films. The acting in this movie is amazing Janet Leigh (mother of successful actress Jamie Lee Curtis who would star in the John Carpenter classic masterpiece ""Halloween"" that was heavily influenced by ""Psycho"") was excellent as Marion Crane, but the real star of the film is the late and great Anthony Perkins (who tragically died of AIDS may he rest along with Mr. Hitchcock) who portrayed Norman Bates PERFECTLY he really seemed like a nervous, shy man who was afraid of his own shadow he played the part down to the T (hell of a lot better than Vince Vaughn in the remake that shall not be spoken of). Hitchcock's brilliant writing and directing has made this one of the greatest films I've ever seen to date and on Damian's Top 250 Films of All-Time this ranks at #29. This film really is amazing. I've only seen this a few times and the VERY first time I saw it the suspense just had me glued to the film and I couldn't look away again and I have to say one more time: bravo Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins may you both rest in peace. ***** Out of ***** Stars",Psycho
832,max-swindlehurst,By far the greatest horror/suspense film of all time.,10,17 May 2012,"Psycho is by far the greatest horror film of all time, and one of the earliest made horror films of all time. Everything about this film is perfect especially the famous 'shower scene'.Visually, Hitchcock subtly represents these theories through symbolism, lighting, shapes (that reflect the characters personality) and dialogue. The most interesting and important concept that ties in with almost every other aspect of the movie are the constant metaphors that represent the psychodynamic theory of the psyche; the id - impulsive, the ego - creates realistic ways to satisfy the id's demands and the superego which is the moral compass that regulates the other two. Throughout the superego is represented in a number of ways; the policeman, the stuffed birds and Marion (just before her murder). And Norman of course represents the ego and id; although his conflict is brought to the surface through schizophrenic means. This concept that I have tried my best to explain barely scratches the surface of what is a movie jam packed with interesting analogies and metaphors. But all this complexity resonates from the focal exploration of the human mind and makes the audience question their own ethics.There is no sloppiness in this movie in terms of a visual and aural experience, as Hitchcock's objective of 'messing' with the audience requires and almost flawless film viewing experience; an that this is.",Psycho

834,ihann,Just the best,10,22 December 2005,"There is a before and after of this movie in the history of movies. Hithcook may be the director with more ""new things"" in his time. Is difficult to know how big could be he now in this special effects time. Psycho is a perfect combination of a great director, a great cast and a great script. Perkins makes his best job in this movie. Norman Bates is a legend. A lot of people did not see Psycho but everybody knows who is Norman Bates. The movie has a lot of symbols and the music is the best. Hitch confirms in this movie that good actors and good staff is enough to make a good movie. North by Northwest was excellent, but it cost 3 or 4 times more than Psycho. It is more than a cult film. Psycho is really a masterpiece. Psycho is a movie that you can watch 20 times and every time that you see it, found new elements. Is full of details. The subliminal presence of the mother figure is present in all the movie. The color of the under ware of Marion changes to black after she left the town trying to express that she feels dirty. And the scene of the bath... is maybe the most famous scene in the history... is difficult to perceive after that yo never saw a naked body and never so a knife inside of the victim.

Very few movies are able to do that, so this is high praise indeed. All the praise you've heard about this film is true. The acting (especially by Perkins) is excellent, the score unsettling, and the cinematography brilliant.The story begins with two lovers in Phoenix sharing a quick romp during Marion's (played by Janet Leigh) lunch break. She returns to her job and is given $40,000 to deposit at the bank. She takes the money and returns to her home, then decides to flee Phoenix and run away with her boyfriend. She drives most of the night, and, tired, pulls in to the Bates motel for the night....Suffice it to say, what follows is one of the best murder-thrillers I've had the pleasure to watch. Everything about this movie is handled well, and Perkins knocks it out of the park playing the friendly, stuttering, and finally chilling Norman Bates. I can only imagine how shocking this movie was when it was released in 1960 -- many of these themes had yet to be explored in cinema, and if the infamous bathroom scene is still a bit unsettling to modern viewers, it must have been truly terrifying at the time.This film is Hitchcock at his finest. Pure suspense.",Psycho
837,silven-87129,cool,10,9 November 2019,"Since the greatness of such a Director as Alfred Hitchcock can be said endlessly, then I, perhaps, focus my attention on acting. Psycho is definitely a Thriller with a capital letter. It is indisputable that it is quite difficult to judge the films that have passed through time, because of our impregnation with the culture of modern cinema. In addition, many Hitchcock classics may seem quite ordinary black and white picture. This happens to people whose eyes fundamentally do not perceive black and white classics. I must say that they lose a lot. Me same this the film hit immediately.In General, I tend to evaluate the film, first of all, from the point of view of acting. I would like to highlight Anthony Perkins ' performance. Let me remind you that his hero is a psychopathic killer who lives as a hermit, creating even more fear about his image. It is necessary to pay tribute that such an image of the main characters of horror films, in turn, is often used in modern horror, which, above all, speaks of the classics of this picture. To be honest, the game Perkins hooked me not childishly. So I watched, literally with my mouth open. This eye that draws you to the screen, monotonous and at the same time sharp movements that speak about his unstable psyche of his character and cause a contradictory first impression, the famous smile - all these details, observed by both Hitchcock and Perkins, deserve praise. And what the film's production and acting do together is difficult to describe in words. I am a fan of non-standard acting. Expressiveness and emotionality used by actors is alien to me. Most of all in the game I like realism, when purely individual qualities of the actor help him not to overplay, that is, to adhere to the Golden mean. Perkins, for the most part, manages to intrigue the viewer thanks to his incredible male charm.As for the work of Vera miles, the role of the weaker sex in A. Hitchcock is, first of all, the embodiment of femininity, which brings its unique charm to the picture, and therefore, speaking about her game it is difficult to find fault or comment on something. Women are an integral part of Hitchcock thrillers, and to me, her acting is no different from that of grace Kelly or Joan Fontaine. In his works, they act on a special pattern-either in danger or in the arms of a man. Thus, women in his films are an integral attribute, but not the basis.Speaking of the film as a whole-it is certainly a masterpiece. It's all so coherent, clear and while watching there is a strange feeling that you-not the only observer, for the most part, because of the use of unusual angles. And, of course, the saddest thing that makes me think about this kind of classic is that such films are one of a kind and some techniques in modern cinema are no longer used.",Psycho
838,AugustK1ng,That Shower Scene,10,22 April 2020,"For those of us born in the 90's or later I can guarantee you know what I'm about to describe. The dramatic orchestral music, a woman stabbed in the shower, and a zoom in shot of the blood running down the shower drain. It's been imitated and referenced for decades and for good reason. While compared to the gore and ""realistic"" murder and horror scenes in films today its far from...well it's a little cheesy. But the film captures and puts you on edge somehow. The dramatic and dark scenery combined with the intense musical score is perfection. Theres not much else I can say that won't sound like repetition so I'll just give it my stamp of approval and a 10/10 would recommend.",Psycho

844,ac947,My favorite from the Master of Suspense,9,23 May 2003,"Psycho is my all time favorite of Hitchcock, although I have to admit that I still haven't yet seen all his silent films. Hitchcock had just finished his television series and obviously had learned something new about BW film making. (And this from the director of many fine BW films including Rebecca.) Too bad that Psycho was his last BW film.Be sure to watch the ""Lee flees by auto"" sequence with the sound turned off at least once to aid in understanding the enormous value of Bernard Herrmann's all string film score to the tension of the film. (the same should be done in the ""Stewart stawks Novak by auto"" sequence in Vertigo- again to Herrmann's score.) I think a compelling case can be made that Herrmann's association with Hitch brought his films to a new level during the Rope to Marnie period.(Spoilers to follow.)Keep an eye out for the foreshadowing here. Wiper blades in Lee's car and the knives on the wall (the only diagonal props) at the hardware store pointed at Arbogast's head from two different angles!! I haven't seen this mentioned in any of the literature about the film, perhaps because the knives pointing effect is so obvious that it is hard to call it ""foreshadowing"". And don't miss the rope pulling the car out of the swamp and ""hanging"" Perkins at the end while the mother's skull/teeth are double exposed for a fraction of a second.",Psycho
845,christopher256_98,Maybe the Greatest of all Horror Films.,10,23 December 2012,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was a revolutionary in the horror genre when it shocked audiences back in 1960. Watching it again on blu-ray I can say confidently it has held up extremely well. It stars Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and John Gavin, all in strong performance, especially Perkins whose creepy yet vulnerable Norman Bates led to him being typecast as that character for the rest of his life. But without the touch of the master Hitchcock it would have been nothing more than a very decent thriller. The atmosphere is amazing, tension builds perfectly, and even if you know the outcome the shocking turns will leave those who haven't had the pleasure of seeing it with their hearts racing.Marion Crane has stolen some money, a lot of money, in the irrational hope she can use it to help her boyfriend. After arousing the suspicion of a cop and a car dealer she arrives at the Bates Motel where she meets the odd but seemingly kind owner, Norman Bates. The rest, well spoiling anything else is either unforgivable because it's so huge or pointless because so many people, even without having seen it, know the major twist going in. I knew the shocker before I first saw the movie, but if it dampened the experience it didn't do it by much. Every scene has a purpose (yes even that ending that some think was unnecessary), every character is meaningful and many shots are unforgettable. This one of Hitchcock's best and arguably the greatest horror film ever made.",Psycho

Lights all turned off to add to the suspense. Its one of those films you can only really see once, but I have watched it more than 10 times! I think that the music for this film is amazing, from the opening credits to the infamous ""Shower Scene"". Obviously I would say it was Hitchcock's best (as a lot of people would agree) and the casting choice is brilliant, unlike the 1998 'disasterpiece' with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates(seriously?!). Anthony Perkins has got to be one of the greatest movie villains ever! I cannot recommend this film enough!

I didn't think it would be an amazing movie or scary at all. I have seen the birds, and some other Hitchcock movies which didn't scare me in any way, so i didn't think this one would either. Well this movie ended up creeping me out. I cant imagine how people reacted to it when it first came out in theaters in 1960. I love horror movies and not many scare me anymore but this one did.I think it would have been even better for me if I hadn't heard it was based off of ed gein, because that sort of gave away the end for me.

848,norse76,Still Amazing After All These Years,10,17 October 2005,"Being an avid movie fan, I have seen too many motion pictures to even bother trying to count. I love all types: drama, comedy, action, sci-fi, foreign and horror. But I would have to say that my favorite genre is suspense. Something about thrilling audiences without the use of special effects, and creating realistic settings which cause a sense of dread for the audience. And nobody, in my opinion, accomplished this with a greater sense of style, polish, and dignity than Alfred Hitchcock. His films are full of great dialog, well-rounded characters, and genuine and original shocks.Of all of his films, my favorite would have to be ""Psycho"". This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off. See it for the first time (and even a tenth) and enjoy a master director at the peak of his craft.",Psycho

The haunting score, chilling atmosphere, and grisly murders struck a chord and created the horror genre of film. For 1960, it deals with then-scandalous matters like domestic abuse, voyeurism, and ""split personality"" very well. Everyone remembers the shower scene, but what has always chilled me is the venomously possessive mother-child relationship. Mrs. Bates berates her son mercilessly, showing a sadistic pleasure in emotionally torturing him. So well before murder rears its fatal head, we knew something evil was happening in that lonely house on the hill. Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates perfectly as the young man with darkness behind his odd, shy manner. Janet Leigh was excellent as Marian. Yes, this film is as good as they say.

852,mrsweeneytodd,Hitchcock: True Cinematic Genius(spoilers),10,28 April 2000,"My mother always used to complain about this movie, it being the one suspense/horror film she actually went to.  The shower scene tormented her dreams for a long period of time.  I am very glad that she never actually gave me the details of the movie, as I was able to enjoy it without anything spoiled.  From the point of the unknowing 90's viewer, this movie still holds up superbly, and becomes even more amazing if enough Hitchcock documentaries are watched.  I find a couple of things are overlooked though. The greatest scene in my opinion is not the shower scene(although having the billed star die halfway through the film is incredible).  It is the conversation between in the hotel room with the stuffed birds in the background.  Subtle with so many distinct ironies and fantastic underplayed acting, mixed with the eerieness of that background creates maybe my second favorite scene in film(the first being the ending stairwell scene from Vertigo)  Perhaps what creeped me out the most was the visual of that lonely forgotten house atop the hill, definitely embued with some unknown prescence that the audience cannot quite put their finger on.  Like all stellar pieces of film or theater, there is a great deal of humor despite the premise of the work.  The most amazing part of this film is its implication on cinema as a whole - the disturbing material inspired countless psychological thrillers and changed film forever.  Although none will be able to match this movie for the sake of pure cinematic beauty, that's where the genius of Hitchcock comes into play.  He is probably the single greatest director of our time(sorry Kubrick), despite many nowadays not being able to enjoy what they consider ""dated"" films.  *Sigh*",Psycho

Let's start with the suspenseful plot, after all it was made by the master of suspense. Throughout the movie I constantly had an unsettling feeling in my stomach like something was wrong even though I was only watching a movie. The scenes were so well thought out that everything seemed like it was leading to something else which got overwhelming after a while and added to the general Mise-en-scene of the movie, creepy. Watching a movie where i constantly had to be thinking something was going to happen made me so uncomfortable but that was i point i guess because honestly it made the big reveal all the better, little teases at something big happening only for the scene to go by leaving an anxious viewer confused and scared of what's to come. The shots in each scene seemed like they served a purpose the longer I looked at something that would've been a shorter shot or a couple of frames the more confused I was. Like staring at the cop across from the dealer was awkward yet helped set the scene of fear for the first victim even though she was committing a crime. The dialogue also does the movie a great justice, constantly referring to rain and dampness, along with the actual rain throughout the movie was a great deal in the vibe of the movie. Along with the dim lights and creepy organ music in the background the movie was just the greatest example of what a horror movie should be. This movie made Alfred Hitchcock earn my respect because before this movie i didn't even know who he was, and now he is one of my favorite directors.",Psycho

Rather than the dialogue serving merely as links between gruesome murders, the script is loaded with innuendo, emotion, and most importantly, clues.The 'sympathy' aspect of the film begins in the opening scene, when Marion Crane is upset that she must meet her lover in secret and cannot yet marry him.  She believes she is hard-done-by and put-upon...until she meets Norman Bates, a good-hearted but spineless young man who is kept tightly under the thumb of his dominating mother.  The scene in the motel parlor between Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh demonstrates the high level of acting that went into this film.  It contains some of the film's most memorable lines, including:""Mother, what is the phrase...isn't quite herself today.""""A boy's best friend is his mother.""""She just goes a little mad sometimes.  We all go a little mad sometimes.""One does not watch this film merely for the forty-five second shower scene (although that scene alone, still as horrifying the fiftieth time as the first, is well worth it).

Psycho is best described as an excellent flick that contains strong and effective scenes with good acting, powerful suspenseful moments and a brilliant plot! And when I say brilliant plot...I mean BRILLIANT!Psycho is shot in black and white, gray-scale/monochrome gray color, but that only makes it more distinguished and interesting as an independent movie from the 60'sA young woman, named Marion Crane, decides to steal 40.000$ from her employer's client when she gets the chance.

A week passes by and one day, Marion's Sister, Lila, arrives at Sam's store only to inform him of her sister's disappearance!Alfred Hitchcock did a great job as a director in this movie. I especially felt that the opening scene was shot amazingly well from a wide angle which then, dives into the house. And not to mention...the legendary shower sequence! Brilliant directing :)The cast is good. Janet Leigh has her moments as Marion. Vera Miles, who played her sister, also did a great job. Martin Balsam was outstanding as detective Milton Arbogast and John Gavin did his job of portraying the heroic Sam Loomis... But the one who I think stole every scene completely and made it into his own, was Anthony Perkins, I mean..that guy was, without any doubts, way ahead of his time! It's stunning to watch him transform into, and become, Norman Bates. His manners and stuttering... he definitely at least deserved an Oscar nomination in my opinion (and probably many others).About the spoilers...Let's just say that this movie has a great conclusive ending and delivers the plot and twist in the best way possible.I thought this movie was extremely good and think that people ought to watch it and forget about modern-day special effects or brainless gore that people have gotten so used to.

You show too much, there's not enough suspense. Show to little, and people don't know what's going on. Different angles and lighting can evoke different feelings. Hitchcock is a master of not only coming up with a great story, but telling that story perfectly. Hitchcock finds the perfect balance between terror, suspense, and mystery in all his films, and Psycho is certainly no exception. It is no surprise that one of the most iconic scenes in Hollywood history is in this movie. To top it off the acting is phenomenal as well. Often times with films at the time scenes of strong emotion would be excessively dramatic and over the top.

871,ryanvaine,you should watch this movie,10,17 April 2020,"In my cinema class, our weekly unit was on Hitchcock films. So, I chose to watch ""Psycho."" Hitchcock is known for his horror films, and this is by far my favorite Hitchcock horror. I think this film has quality cinematography. The sound effects used, really added to the spooky vibe this film gives off. This film has many camera angels, short shots, and clean transitions. The editing and directing was outstanding. Throughout this film I felt like I was on the edge of my seat and had an eerie feeling. ""Psycho"" makes me think twice before staying at a motel. This film uses psychological and physical aspects to make this film original and thrilling. I really enjoy the plot line, and I think the characters really made this film feel realistic. Also, I really enjoy the television show ""Bates Motel"" that was inspired by this film. I would recommend this film to people who love horror films. It is really good, and entertaining.",Psycho
872,lordmaserati,A different level of horror,9,20 October 2020,"Consider this Hitchcock at his very best, for it's like a ""basis"" for horror films.Psycho's plot of simplicity is what transcends this movie into becoming, psychological unique.
The antagonist ""Norman Bates"" or ""Mother"", is one identity controlled by two people; he and his mother.How Norman is taken over by his mother and commits all these murderers, is what truly shows bestows sinister lunacy; showing his mother controlled him like a dog on a leash.It doesn't matter if you hate horror or don't like Hitchcock, this movie needs to be seen once in your life.",Psycho
873,eawelkley,Anthony Perkins: Robbed of Recognition,10,16 November 2020,"There's something rather fitting about the first Alfred Hitchcock film I've seen being one of his most famous. Unfortunately, thanks to pop culture having referenced the now famous shower scene in Psycho, I was already aware of the 'twist' early in the film that shocked audiences of the day, so a fair bit of the impact that Hitchcock had intended to create is lost on me. It is a shame that I can't experience this fantastic film with fresh eyes from 1960, but I would love to have the opportunity. However, the film's score is extremely effective at being unnerving and distinct from almost any other movie I've seen. Using only string instruments as a budget restraint proved to be beneficial to the tone of the movie. The same reasoning also applies to the decision to film in black and white, which may be a point against it to some people, but not me. Also impressive was Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates. He truly gives off the impression of a man completely unhinged, from his occasional stuttering, to the numerous physical things he does like the subtle twitching, and the completely deranged expressions he puts on. I can imagine why he reprised his role for every subsequent Psycho sequel movie, even though I haven't seen them. Definitely worth a watch today, even if some of the more intense moments may have lost their impact over the course of time.",Psycho
874,wmnzr,a supreme classic,10,17 October 2021,"""Psycho"" is the kind of movie that you really have to make sure that you see if you're going to be the kind of people who want to talk about the history of Hollywood movies. Like some others, Mr. Hitchcock produced or directed quite a few famous films. The basic idea in this one is to tell the story of the strange things that happen after a woman checks in at a spooky old motel. In a way, many might claim that this movie by itself could show you that Mr. Hitchcock belongs having a reputation for doing the very highest quality work, but I'd especially recommend ""The Birds"" if you just can't resist a little more scary stuff. And try to get back to the car safely when you're all done!",Psycho
875,hamzaspencer,Brillant horror masterpiece,9,8 October 2020,"There always will be a before and a after Psycho in the cinema history. And besides of being one of the best, if not the best, Hitchcock productions, Psycho is an absolute, timeless, masterpiece for sure. Btw I think the film offers us one of the most iconic scene of all time. (the bathroom scene) And I REALLY wanna talk a little bit about Anthony Perkins's mind-blowing performance as the psychotic character Norman Bates. I mean this guy didn't even win an Oscar for that role. Wtf ? Nothing more to say more. Just The Master of Suspense himself at its best.",Psycho
876,Eliks,Essential thrills for everyone,10,28 January 2006,"A young woman defrauds her boss and attempts to get away with the money. On her way to escape, she stops at a deserted motel owned by an introvert Norman Bates (Perkins), and quite unexpectedly gets killed from the hands of Norman's mother. A young couple, with the helping hand of a private eye, follow the tracks of the missing woman down to the motel. And soon the murder unfolds the mystery behind the perpetrator's mind.Psycho is a masterpiece of a thrilling, typically Hitch meta-genre cinema. Counting the number of references in other movies, you can easily call it a cult classic, which should be dug in the ground inside a time-capsule. The famous shower scene is just one thing why you simply must see this one, although labeling this movie as 'horror' is a bit misleading. Yet, some people consider it a proto-slasher movie, take notice everyone. And after those 45 years it is still a great watch for newbies. Recommended to all the Martians who have fallen on Earth and have no clue about the cinema.",Psycho
877,jidosha,it will catch you off guard,9,27 October 2013,"It will catch you off guard and shock you by the end. It seems so stimulating at the start but as the movie develops you wonder ""why am I watching this?"". It confuses you as to what the hell is going on. Awkward moments and bothersome ambient noise will blur your attention. But if you're open minded and curios enough it will set the viewer for what is really to come.what is brilliant about this is that i think it does that on purpose; to get you nonchalant. It seems like you know what is going on but it springs you off later on.Though the plot is at praise, the acting is really mediocre and the visual and sound effects may seem unsatisfying. But it was the 60's (you could say late 50's) so what could you expect? And it's kind of ludicrous to try and compare it to modern films but it's hard to refrain from that. the shower scene is really iconic as well as the intense music used.",Psycho
878,kowalski_91,I hated it,1,15 March 2005,"If there were negetives in the vote, mine would be much lower than 1. I mean, what was that? I tell you what it was..... It was a waste of resources, and almost two hours of my life! The main character dies?!?! What is this? Now, I've seen some lame movies in my day, but nothing comes even close to the utter crappiness of 'Psycho.' It was the most overrated film in existence.One day, about 6 months ago, I came across this movie at Roger's Video, and I rented it, just to see what all the fuss was about. The story line sucked, and the plot was loose. Who wants to watch a movie about some old hack who works as a real-estate agent? I'll tell you who; perverts, and housewives. Rated 'R'? For what, repulsive? retarded? rendered useless? Here in Canada, it got a 'PG', even that seems a little high! For Chrissakes, I thought I was watching the Bob Hope Christmas Special! It made me laugh! Those losers who say they never took a shower again can burn in hell! Hitchcock's worst, and thats no easy feat! The Birds was good, and thats it! I give it: negative *****/5",Psycho
879,robocopssadside,"For what it is, Psycho pretty much is a perfect film.",10,18 February 2005,"It's very disappointing that Anthony Perkins was type-casted due to this performance. I think he proves here that he could play any type of character. With Bates alone you get more than one personality, and he plays them all up well. One of the best scenes in the movie is the dinner with Bates and Marion. It's a really well-developed sequence. And it shows Bates from both sides of the spectrum. A lonesome nice guy with a bit of sadness, then out pops a slight hint of perhaps madness or insanity.Watching this movie over and over, it still doesn't get boring to me. The build-up of Leigh's character being washed from existence doesn't become boring to me after multiple viewings. It's a Hitchcock movie. His style of filming leaves so much beauty to look at before the horror begins here. I found myself wandering all over the sets while re-watching this. And I think the first 45 minutes gives you a perfect introduction to Marion. At first you think she is going to get away with her spir of the moment crime, then you learn that the good in her knows what she did was wrong, and that she wants to go back and make the best she can of her mistake. Sadly, she never gets to, and one of the most iconic death scenes in horror history is born. And that character that became so solid in your minds that you are just so certain is the lead heroine, is gone. Watching it now and still knowing of the scene in the shower still gives me disbelief that that's how it went down.Richard Band owes a lot of gratitude to the movie's film score. When I watch Re-Animator, the opening of Psycho immediately comes to mind.I'm no expert on film, and I like some real bad crap and no brainer films. But I look at this film as a flawless masterpiece.",Psycho
880,micahbundy,PSYCHOlogical terror at its best!,9,23 January 2018,"Psycho is a slasher/thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock. This film follows a young Phoenix secretary named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). She embezzled forty thousand dollars from her employer so she can get away with her secret lover. During this, she tries to avoid a police officer that is suspicious of her by taking back roads and stops at the Bates Motel. She meets the owner of the motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). At first, he seems like a polite man, but as the film moves on she becomes unsure of him and his intentions. My nitpick with this film comes from the beginning of this film. In the beginning of this film, Alfred Hitchcock does a great job of establishing the character, as he always does. The beginning of this film uses the setting, her job, the things around her, and all the smallest details of her character to do so. This makes her stealing the forty thousand dollars feel like a very believable move for the character. Hitchcock continues to do this and it pays off as the character sees great development throughout the first half of the film. Although, as this happens, this film is simply without an identity and even when Norman Bates arrives on the scene, you can't help but wonder what kind of film your watching.This is quickly shoved aside when you learn what kind of character Norman Bates is and what his intentions are. From here on the film feels perfect. Bernard Herrmann gives a chilling score that becomes even more effective in the second half of the film when it compliments intense murder scenes and Anthony Perkins terrifying performance. Anthony Perkins simply gives one of the best performances ever. He gives a truly disturbing one that still keeps the viewer wanting more. Anthony Perkins takes over this film by himself.The second half of this film moves smoothly and is very unpredictable. This film boasts great character development, an unexpected and fulfilling plot, and one of the greatest performances ever seen on film. This film has one or two negatives that are only nitpicking and doesn't take away from the film. For me, this is a near perfect film, but this is mostly due to Anthony Perkins performance. My score: 9.5/10",Psycho
881,seanang,Good thriller.,10,22 December 2015,"I understand that this is a horror movie, but this is a mystery film of a murder. The director know that we will get scared or petrified in the shower scene. Marion is a office worker who stole money, which is another mystery besides the murder done by Norman. I understand that this have a lot of spoilers and I know all of them. I find this less violent and more sexual base on the content shown in the film. Even worst, this is 1960 and it looks quite wrong to me. This film might be quite horrible and even scary for young children, so parents should watch out before watching this film in the first place due to violence and sexual content, mostly the sexual content. I understand why this film received mixed reviews at first, because of its acting and controversies, but overall, this film is good due to the suspense.",Psycho

The story is pretty linear and follows the grim events that take place at bates motel, it's hard to say much without spoiling the plot but if you're a fan of psychological horror I'm sure you'd enjoy it. The film is also filled with all sorts of neat motifs and symbolism that are fun to discover within the first or second viewing. This film will surely linger in your brain long after watching it.

Just seeing how disturbed Norman Bates is, is a very creepy thing.  Hitchcock filmed this without one imperfection.  He used a lot of mirrors in Psycho, and I personally think the scariest scene in the entire movie is where Marion's sister goes up to ""Mrs. Bates"" room, and she thinks she sees someone behind her, and turns around, but its just herself in the mirror.  Another very interesting thing about Psycho was all the bird references.  Marion's last name is ""Crane"" Norman even says to her ""You eat like a bird"" and Norman's office is filled with stuffed birds.  Psycho's shower scene is by far the most suspenseful moment in the history of film.  I think so anyway!  To finish this up, I'd just like to say that Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a classic, and no one should be remaking it!!! !!",Psycho
885,nickdove,"Overrated, underperformed B-movie",5,27 March 2003,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" has gone down in history as one of the most psychologically disturbing thrillers ever made. I strongly disagree. I started this movie fully expecting to be disturbed and scared, but finished it feeling robbed. The problem with this movie is the hype. Had it not been hyped as the scariest film ever made, than it would have gone over better. But as it stands, Psycho DOESN'T stand. Back in 1960, movie-going Americans were not at all expecting this, had never seen anything like this, and were probably very shocked when they did. This movie started the endless number of slasher-type films we know today, such as ""Halloween"", and the Jason series. Of them, I can't say Psycho is any better. Hitchcock does well with the cinematography, but falls short in the suspense area. His predecessors, such as Ridley Scott (Alien), Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath), and many others succeeded where he failed. The acting in Psycho is pretty good, though sometimes mechanical. Bottom-line: If you have NEVER seen a horror film, particularly of the slasher type, than you will find this a chilling film. But for modern, decensitized America, it will only be looked at as a good B-movie.",Psycho
886,grandmalop911,A classic if there ever was one.,10,27 December 2000,"As much as I like the 1998 remake it was very unnecessary in my opinion. Why remake something that is already perfected? Psycho is probably the best horror movie this world will ever see. I think the fact that it's in black and white actually adds to the suspense of it all. Most of the movies from the 60's have faded with time and aren't spoken of much anymore but psycho even before the remake is still very remembered, very fresh in our heads, and still held in the very highest respects. (and thats not the only one of Hitchcock's movies that is.) I will always love the famous shower scene and always think about when I'm home alone in the shower and hear a noise. Not every movie has a scene in it that can live in your head like that. One of the ideas in this movie that i particularly like is how Marion was going to go back and fix what she had done wrong in the morning but it was too late. No one would have ever known after that that she was sorry and she was going to bring the money back it just brings up and interesting point. I wish todays horror movies were this good.",Psycho

It has this special style that could only be achieved through the eyes of Alfred Hitchcock and the excellent actors in the film.  There is this mysteriousness that presides over the movie, and that is what adds to the overall feeling from Psycho. Hitchcock's eye for great suspense really does the trick for this movie. He also chose to go Black and White in this movie, instead of color for his own stylistic purposes (and to hide the redness of...yeah.) The B&W really makes the movie more ""scary"". No one can forget the Bates Motel or the mysterious house on the hill behind it with ""that person"" in the window.  Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates also has his best performance of his career in this movie, bringing the character of Norman Bates to life. Even 40 years later, no movie is able to stand up to Psycho or make a larger impact on world culture.  Truly the best movie of all time, definitely a 10/10.",Psycho

Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, wonderfully played and delivers a fine performing main iconic role. Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates is very seemingly charismatic on first impressions. Yet is very troubled and eccentric. Sneaky and sideways glancing. With his strange hobby of stuffing birds. All the characters are extremely detailed. The film has so many clever aspects. Atmospheric, orchestral, suspense, the music alone provides all of these essential key areas as well as the visual side. Then there's the mysterious, nagging, possessive mother of Bates who you don't see who dominates him. Strange how bird references come up in this, Hitchcock's fascination. Loved his cameo near the start. The shower scene comprises of utter genius in how it is shot. A stabbing, thrusting, shadowy figure relentlessly going crazy with a deadly blade. Marion's outstretched hand leaving a shocking farewell to her life cruelly ripped away. A close up of her eye, the final montage. Again it's extremely clever how the whole shower scene leaves a bitter taste yet never shows us anything in the regions of graphic violence. Leaves the audience, the viewer's mind to fill in the blanks. A shocker twist regarding the killer and a final revelation at it's peak. An intelligent film from the old master Alfred Hitchcock. Best thriller ever done.",Psycho
892,co_oldman,"Lock Them Bathroom Doors, Kids",10,8 February 2017,"Psycho, one of the best horror films of all time, has become irretrievably embedded in popular consciousness. Few are unaware of the iconic shower scene and the shrill string instrumentation that accompanies it, whether they have seen the film or not. The production values are, without exception, exemplary, even though the film was made on a comparatively small budget and largely with a television crew.The expressive and natural performance of Anthony Perkins in the role of Norman Bates launched his career and dogged him for the rest of it on account of his subsequent typecasting. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane convincingly betrays an increasing sense of alarm at her immoral behaviour and her helplessness at preventing it. Bernard Hermann's score, which adds tension throughout the film, even to seemingly innocuous scenes, has been rightly singled out for praise, not least from the director himself. I doubt whether a better reproduction of the sound of stabbing someone with string instruments is possible. The music for the main credits sets the tone for the film, foreshadowing the drama, danger, and violence that punctuates it.The cinematographer uses black and white film to its full advantage. The result is, in my opinion, as impressive as the film's score. The lack of colour robs the film of vitality and warmth, creating a sense of dread in the viewer. Shadows and darkness provide cover for illicit deeds or an elegant way of framing images. In a memorable scene, the long shadow of various birds of prey makes them appear alive and even more frightening, as if they were ready to attack the character or, by extension, the viewer who shares her perspective.The shower scene deserves a special mention. The scene occurs in the middle of the film, at a point when viewers have become absorbed in the story, forgetting, if only slightly, that what they are watching isn't real. Shooting the scene from the perspective of the killer was a stroke of genius. A tranquil scene of a woman enjoying a warm shower greets the viewer. The woman even begins to hum jauntily. Immediately the viewer feels as if he shouldn't be spying on this woman, much less pulling back the shower curtain. Soon they see themselves stabbing her relentlessly and viciously. Hitchcock grants the viewer no respite as the murder is shown from a multitude of angles. The jarring montage of violent images frightens and disturbs. Indeed, one would be forgiven for looking around the room afterwards to see whether there are any murderers lurking in the shadows. The dissonant strings, at once, accentuate the helpless cries of the woman and the violent rage of the killer. The scene concludes with a close up of the lifeless eye of the woman. The eye may signify the viewer's vicarious participation in the murder through watching it, confronting him with his perverse enjoyment of the gruesome scene.Psycho does have its flaws. The exposition at the end of the film is superfluous as the climactic scene provides the same information, obviating the awkward insertion of an ad hoc monologue. The scene in which a character falls down stairs, which, to be sure, would have thrilled contemporary audiences with its groundbreaking special effects, has not aged well. The clumsy and conspicuous use of special effects shatters the illusion, reminding the viewer that he is watching a film. The deputy sheriff's lack of interest in investigating the theft of $40 000 beggars belief.The virtually unrivalled excellence of the bulk of the film, reaching its apogee during the shower scene, transcends any residual imperfections. Psycho, through its elevation of the horror genre and its inspiration of subsequent generations of filmmakers and film enthusiasts, is surely deserving of its place in the canon of American cinema.",Psycho
893,BonsterT,"Psycho, horror movies, and metaphors in psycho",10,10 April 2006,"Pitch perfect. Every single frame of this film was shot by a genius, and a Genius Hitchcock was. psycho still remains as one of the greatest horror movies of all times. Is it more then just a ""Hooror Movie."" I mean this term has been used very commonly but has been perspective very falsely. When people hear the word ""Horror Movie"" they think of butcher knifes into teenage beauties and screaming but no real meaning. In my opinion this is not true. Throughout history, horror movies have had many metaphoric and subtle yet deep meanings. Even the goriest as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is not just a movie about a guy in a mask chopping up teenagers. Now, about Psycho, this movie is very interesting. Starting with a plot about a young woman, Marion, who steals forty thousand dollars (More like 400 thousand now according to inflation) to have enough money with Sam, her lover, and live with him. When she gets passed the salesman and policeman she creates other people's conversation in her head as she heads off in the Bates Motel.As the viewer is interested in Marions life a brand new character is introduced, Norman Bates. If you notice Norman is very persistent that she calls him Norman instead of Mr. Bates. Twice he corrects her. This, i feel, is him trying to separate from his mother. He feels so controlled by his mother he doesn't want to be Mr. Bates, which contains his mother's last name in it, he wants to be Norman, himself. Now, as they talk about being stuck in a trap, both of the characters have been trapped into a situation. Norman with his mother, Marion with her money. Both characters have many similarities, split personalities, etc. And I think that is the main reason Norman felt such an attraction to her. Not because of her beauty and charm, but him and her connection. As she leaves he looks through a hole to watch her dress. (Notice what painting he removes from the wall, one depicting a rape) Here he watches her, like one of his stuffed birds, while she undress. I notice both their names have a lot to do with their reasoning in the plot. Norman ""Bates"" as he is awaiting to be caught, and Marion ""Crane"" a bird she is to catch Norman. Anyways, now Marion gets nude and takes a shower. Earlier she suggested returning the money so now the audience is nice and happy. As she is taking a shower, we notice a slight blur in the background. This blur turns into a maniac silhouette mother stabbing the young and innocent nude, blonde bombshell with her 12 inch long butcher knife. What makes the shower scene so intense is not the loud, intense music but the shots, from down watching the knife coming at you, to the mouth of Marion screaming in terror while a the violin is screeching.I have a lot to say, theme-wise about this film but then this will be too long, if you want to know give me a private message and I will send you all my reasoning for many lines.",Psycho

But besides that and the good directing, it totally lacks of brilliance. The actors were OK, but not worthy of all the praise they were given for it... Just take a look at what they have achieved in life: Anthony Perkins: 1 Oscar nomination (for supporting role), Janet Leigh: 1 Oscar nomination (for Psycho, which tells us a lot), and I won't even mention Vera Miles simply because there is nothing to mention. These are no great actors, not in any other movies, and neither in Psycho. Then we come to the story, the part of the film I really did not like. There's simply nothing brilliant about it, it's merely a plain story. Also, it was a little too obvious, referring to the fact that Norman's mother was already dead. This should have been worked out better, just like the shower scene. OK, the idea was brilliant, but I just can't believe, even back in 1960, that people find this shocking. It was such a let-down, I had expected so much more of this scene... It really looked like a big comedy. I know that many of the Psycho fans will disagree with my opinion, but let me just quote Hitchcock to add force to my opinion: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy. Had to be."" Then I wondered, how come it still has become a classic? Well, allow me to again quote Hitchcock: ""Even my failures make money and become classics a year after I make them.""",Psycho

Sensational story, superbly directed by Hitchcock and excellent performances from all actors especially Janet Leigh. An amazing film for 1960, the story is the best horror of all time, the lonely hotel, the eerie house and the quiet mysterious deranged proprietor make the atmosphere sensational. Would have been very enjoyable to have seen this movie when it was first released as the story was unknown and to have the beautiful main character (Janet Leigh) killed so early and in the most vicious way in the shower was such an unexpected and shocking turn! The scene is one of the most famous in movie history but was not done by Tony as he was very squeamish and shy around woman! What began as a young woman running away with some money to better her and her boyfriends future turns into the murdering, deranged world of Norman Bates. You never know that Norman is the killer until the end, nor do you know he is mentally ill, but of course you always have this feeling! The film especially for its time is just so different, so wonderfully done and the story is made from amazing imagination. The film is much better than the book as the character in the book is not similar to Tony Perkins Norman. This was Perkins role of a life time and he does it amazingly, he was born to play this part and will always be here with us as Norman as the film will always be in the memory as it is the best film ever made.It has also influenced every horror movie since and continues to be influential to this day.

Hitchcock has always been the master of suspense, and Psycho is just about his most sinister ever.  From the Gothic setting - the imposing mansion on the hill - to Norman's boyish manner and tortured intensity, Psycho delivers.And if it doesn't make you scream (or at least think twice before talking to that self-effacing stranger), nothing will.

899,Psychett,The best horror movie ever,10,18 June 1999,"I have watched this film about four times now, and I can safely say that this is the best horror movie ever. The actors are the best thing about it. Anthony Perkins is superb as the shy, gorgeous, boyish Norman Bates. His twitchings and stammerings are scarily flawless, and the scene where the car stops momentarily sinking into the swamp, and he stares with a look of pure terror in his eyes, then ultimate relief when it continues are unforgettable. His ""...I wouldn't even harm a fly"" face at the end is inimitable. As for Janet Leigh, she couldn't have gotten into her part more. She looks genuinely desperate when confronted by the police officer. Hitchcock controls the audience as if he were pressing keys on a piano with this film. Everything is perfect about this film, and has become one of my personal favourites. If you haven't seen it, see it now.",Psycho

901,reedmilder,My favorite film!!!,10,2 March 2001,"Although it is extremely difficult to pick a single film as one's favorite, this would be my pick if I were forced to choose.  No, it is not because it is the most shocking or original film ever made (as if there could be).  In 40 years, the film has lost much of what made it revolutionary in 1960.  It is simply a fantastic screenplay that keeps me on the edge of my seat at all times.This is Hitchcock's best work as a director in my opinion.  Though he rarely made a bad film, most of Hitch's films are commercially-directed. I think of North By Northwest, Suspicion, Notorious and The Man Who Knew Too Much as examples.  Though each is a fantastic film, they are not terribly stimulating too watch and have minimal artistic merit.  Psycho, by contrast, is a true work of art.  No one could have expected it to be a hit at the time and was a great departure from Hitch's 1950s films.  There are no Cary Grants or Jimmy Stewarts here.  Just minor stars like Anthony Perkins and Martin Balsam.The two aspects of Psycho that set it apart are its cinematography and score.  There are no panoramic views typical of great cinematographic works. In fact, the whole film has the feel of a B movie.  One need only watch the famous shower scene to understand what I am talking about.  It is perhaps the most breathtaking 2 minutes ever put to film.  Hitch's close up shot of Marion's eye is still jolting today.  Imagine watching the scene on the big screen in 1960!  I guess what truly sets this film apart is the score. Perhaps no film is as tied to its score.  Bernard Herrmann may be the best there ever was at his profession.  His scores for Vertigo and Marnie are also top notch.Just watch this film.  If you've never seen it, it will provide a unique and surprising experience.  If you've already seen it, watch it again and enjoy Hitch at his best!  If you love Psycho as I do, check out Polanski's Repulsion, the French film Diabolique, and Hitch's first talkie Blackmail.",Psycho

Yes, Psycho, after 40 years, still has it's sinister touch.Hitchcock's direction is pure brilliance. The way the camera ""strolls"" suggests the work of someone not of this world. Psycho has it all.The most amazing thing, for me, was the fact that the shower scene is shown on every film documentary, and the story is ruined by every film scholar, and yet, they are still scarier than Michael Myers, zombies, hell-beasts, and the Alien.And the fact that the shower scene isn't the biggest scare! 10-10.

903,dannymanning,The OG,10,7 May 2020,"How to begin talking about Psycho... It was the first movie to show a toilet! Beginning with the toilet, like many things in this movie the showing of a toilet showed the boldness's Alfred Hitchcock was willing to do when making this movie. Psycho may have been rated R but even as an R rated movie this movie when above and beyond any horror movie that had been made before it. The usage of black an white color in order to by pass restrictions on showing blood was a great idea that added so much to this movie. Of course how can you discuss this movie without talking about the infamous shower scene? Originally the shower murder was going to be completely without music, however what has become one of the most parodied movie scenes in movie history was most likely thanks to the inclusion of the ere and creepy music played during this scene. The shower murder itself was very bold like much of the movie, while nothing to revealing is shown, we do see and believe Janet Leigh is full blown naked while being realistically stabbed. Where this movie slows down a little is the explanation scene at the end which was a little awkward, long and boring. Psycho is very interesting movie worth seeing, this movie did so many firsts which overtime has really payed off as Psycho is one of the most well known and beloved movies.",Psycho

The black and white cinematography, combined with low key lighting in most of the (indoor)scenes, gives the story a mysterious look which is reminiscent of the film noir genre of the 1940s. The film score is at its most powerful in Marion's driving-in-the-rain scene and in the famous shower scene. Anthony Perkins is really perfect as the psychotic killer, having just the right combination of rage, vulnerability, fear, and compulsion. The finale, where the psychologist explains the character of Norman Bates,completes the film very well. All in all, one of the greatest films ever made.",Psycho

The script was also fantastic, and the camera angles were also perfect there were no over the top moments, they were just right. And finally, the soundtrack to this movie was amazing.Though there are a couple of complaints I have got and one of them is that there is a couple of scenes which were totally pointless and some of the effects were quite, how shall I put it, 'shabby'.Overall though this is one of my new favourites I would have to give this a 10/10.

912,kgm3,One of the greatist movies I have ever seen! !!!SPOILERS!!!,10,8 March 2004,"Psycho is one of the most famous movies in American history. Now that I've seen it, I'm not suprised. The basic plot is: (even though people who haven't seen it already know)The story is about a woman named Marian Crane who steels 40,000 dollars (at that time a 10 years salary!) and runs off to meet her boyfriend. On the way she stops at the BATES MOTEL, a hotel with ""12 rooms and 12 vacancies"" that is owned by a young man named Norman Bates. Norman has his own troubles, he lives with his mother, a spiteful and controlling woman. After a long and moving talk with Norman, Marian makes up her mind to return the money. She goes and takes a shower and is murdered by who appears to be Norman's mother. A few moments later Norman finds her dead. The remainder of the movie is about Marian's sister and boyfriend attempting to find out what happened to Marian, and Norman is trying to cover for ""mom"". Mom ends up to have been dead for 10 years. Norman killed her (for why see movie) and couldn't live with what he had done, so he tried to recreate Mom, in the end he developed Multiple Personality disorder. HE killed Marian and 2 other women before her AS his mother. He would later ""awake as if in a daze"" to discover what he had done. ""Mom"" killed because Norman had been in love with Marian, and the 2 other women and he NEEDED his mother to care about him enough to do anything to keep him with her. At the end we discover the more dominate half of Norman (the ""mother"" half) has probably taken over forever, but he is sent to a place that might be able to help him. (Norman VERY likable when he is him, I hope the place does it's job!)
Amazing performances by all the cast, especially Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. He is believable as the simple, lovable kid and the...... Psycho! I give this movie 10/10 stars, because it is, as far as I can tell, flawless.",Psycho
913,Justin765,A Masterpiece,10,26 June 2014,"Is Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho a masterpiece? In short yes, and is one movie to define a genre for decades. Psycho is the story of a young woman running from a bad decision. The film begins with Marion Crane stealing forty thousand dollars from her employer. On the run from a team of private investigators she comes across the Bates Motel, a hotel in the middle of nowhere ran by Norman Bates. Norman lives alone with only his mother, a mentally disturbed woman. This simple story will progress into one of the most thrilling films of the twentieth century. Alfred Hitchcock directs this terrifying tale with expertise; no detail is left to wonder with all credit due to this monumental director. The script is also top notch with every scene feeling unique and engrossing. I have to say there is one scene in particular that will forever haunt my imagination. To compliment the excellent direction is solid performances by all of the actors, the standout being Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. This masterpiece of the cinema is in every way phenomenal, it will leave you terrified to take a shower and in awe of the plots complexity.",Psycho
914,Acapulqueno,Disorienting in 1960,10,2 August 2005,"Too many reviewers, I think, overlook one of Hitchcock's most effective and disorienting touches. When this film was released in 1960, Janet Leigh was a major star and John Gavin was an important leading man. Those of us who saw it then watched those stars, Leigh and Gavin, plotting a robbery. They seemed to be getting away with it when, with absolutely no warning, the top-billed star gets killed.With the star missing, and the robbery apparently forgotten, the audience was left in the very upsetting position of having no idea as to the possible direction of the story or the identity of the star. In those days Anthony Perkins was little more than a minor juvenile who was listed in a supporting role. Now anybody who sees the movie, even before the first showing, knows that Perkins is the star, and that original disorientation cannot be recreated.",Psycho
915,GrungeFan1996,An American Classic!,9,1 July 2015,"First of all, I'd like to point this out, Psycho is a psychological thriller, not a horror movie, so don't expect a bunch of jump scares or gory scenes, so if you want that, watch the Friday The 13th Series or something. Psycho is undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time! Director Alfred Hitchcock really hit it home with this one. Psycho is about a woman named Marion who steals $40,000 and drives out to Fairville California with the intention of giving the money to her boyfriend Sam. On the way to Fairville, she stops at a motel called the Bates Motel, where she intended to spend the night before finishing her drive. The Bates Motel is run by a young man named Norman Bates who seems harmless, but stutters a lot in his speech. Marion is murdered that night in the motel. A few days later, she (obviously) has not been seen since she left for Fairville, a detective named Arbogast, Marion's sister Lila, and Sam go to look for her, and well, I won't spoil the rest. This film is not scary in terms of jump scares and violence, seeing as there is a very low body count, but it is scary because of the fact that things like these actually happen and you could be a victim of murder. The first half of the film is where the film shines, with fantastic acting and it builds up to the final standoff. The final 20 minutes are typical, cliché moments that we've all seen in thrillers, but Psycho is able to do it without being boring or repetitive. The film has a great ending that you'll probably never forget. Psycho is a classic and a landmark in American filmmaking, one of Hitchcock's greatest pieces of film! 9/10!",Psycho
916,QuenyaSpeaker,Simply Chilling,9,4 January 2006,"You've never experienced chilling until you watch PSYCHO. Alfred Hitchcock was and is the Master of Suspense. The shower scene is one of the most chilling and blood-stopping scenes of all time (especially for its day). However, the real reason the shower scene was so chilling is because of the music. The music is classic and extremely recognizable. Interesting fact: Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) was originally discouraged by friends and family about taking the role of Marion Crane, saying that because she died the role wouldn't be good for her. Well despite all that negative energy from family and friends, Janet took the role. Now that is her most famous role she ever played. As a matter of fact, few people can name any other film she WAS in besides PSYCHO. If you like to be scared but don't like all the gore of many now-a-day horror-suspense films, then PSYCHO is a great Film.*Alexander Smith*",Psycho

The sequel was also good, but the color was for me disturbing. Parts 3 and 4 was bad and the new version was very bad. Why make the same movie with bad actors?

922,bckesler,Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho',10,10 August 2007,"'Psycho' is Alfred Hitchcock's strangest, most disturbing, and best film he has ever made. The movie starts off in Phoenix, Arizona where lovers Sam Loomis and Marion Crane are sharing a secret, passionate afternoon in a cheap hotel. Marion is worried that their relationship won't work because they live so far apart and have to keep their love a secret. In the next scene, Marion is at work, her boss asks her to deliver 40, 000 dollars into the bank. In desperation, she steals the money and pursues California to find her lover and run away with him with their new fortune. On the way, however, Marion goes through several obstacles. A policemen finds her suspicious, as does a car salesman. Marion is a clumsy thief. Finding it hard to see the road through a rainstorm, Marion pulls off into an old inn, The Bates Motel. There she meets Norman Bates, a flirtatious, sad, likable guy who's aggressive mother worries Marion. Here are two people, Marion and Norman, who are both trapped. However, Marion has a chance to redeem herself, and she hopes Norman does too. The choice to film in black and white was an inspiration. Instead of grossing out the audience, Hitchcock disturbs the audience with violent and tragic scenes. Joseph Stefano hands over a brilliant script, making this story extremely interesting from a source material that was rather quite dull. We never know exactly where the storie's going and the melding powers of Hitchcock and Stefano are to thank. The music by Bernard Hermann is pure genius. From the second the film opens, our attention is on the screen. The score is all strings, and it brings out the beauty of the black and white picture. Janet Leigh gives a terrific performance as Marion Crane, as do Gavin Lee, Martan Balsam and Vera Miles as the supporting characters. But the best performances come from a voice over work by Virginia Gregg as 'Mother' and Anthony Perkins' defining role as Norman Bates, not only the best performance in his career, but the best performance given by any actor ever. He captures all the subtleties and tragic struggle of the character so well, that he is one of the most memorable characters of all time. Psycho has a terrific surprise ending and a everything ties up nicely in a psychiatric scene most critics seem to hate, but I find resonate. The film has two reaccuring themes: Dependence and hatred of our own mothers. And describing a word by using the same word: ""Eating in an office is too officious."" ""You make respectability sound disrespectful."" ""I will not speak of such disgusting things because they disgust me."" All in all, Psycho is a near perfect film, and a film that hopefully will live forever.",Psycho

I gave this movie a 10 with a very clear and unbiased viewing.  So believe me when I say: this movie is very best of its field.  The scenes are amazing, everything must have been very intricately imagined by Hitchcock because everything had maximum effect.  Mr. Hitchcock very brilliantly considered all aspects of the movie, even the fact that he had it shot in black and white meshes together so very well.  The villaian is so believable you can almost taste his sweat and franticness.  So are the victims, you can taste their pain.  The murder scene in the shower is the BEST murder scene I have ever seen in my life.  And believe me, I have seen loads of movies to choose from.  The murder scene made Argento's murder scenes look like Sesame Street.  There was an editing of a scene which showed nudity, many people complained about this but I salute the MPAA for cutting out the nudity scene.  This movie is pure, it does not need even a flash of nudity.  I want you all to understand one thing, recently they remade this movie with a newer cast, more money, color, etc. and they could still not come close to touching the power Psycho had.

Director Alfred Hitchcock delivers superb direction and forces you to put your trust in ""Psycho""'s many seedy characters. Anthony Perkins delivers the performance of a lifetime as Norman Bates, the poor pawn of his 'mother'. The film, brilliantly shot in B&W, has become a staple in any movie lover's eye. The entire story revolves around the theft of 400,000 by one Marion Crane(Janet Leigh). This theft entangles her sister(Vera Miles), her lover(John Gavin), a private eye(Martin Balsam), a sheriff(John McIntire), and a lonely hotel manager(Perkins). ""Psycho"" is capable of being rewatched over and over again with little secrets hidden through out. Each character holds some secret: Marion stole some money, Gavin is seeing her on the side, Marion's coworker took tranquilers on her wedding night, her boss has alcohol in the office, client holds undeclared money from the IRS, and Norman has the biggest sequel of all. ""Psycho"" also contains the greatest score of all time which contains only strings which was wonderfully composed by the late Bernard Hermann as well as the best directed scene of all time, the infamous shower scene.

That movement in the shadows that you couldn't possibly have seen...right up until it's too late for you put all those pieces together. What could be more horrifying than that? The last time I saw this film was 15 years ago. I watched it last night and still couldn't get to sleep.",Psycho
937,nostairwaydenied,Hitch is God of Film,10,5 May 2007,"Hitchcock is one fine storyteller.The narrative style is told through the music for the most horrific scenes shown. One other particular scene in which Marion is driving on the freeway toward her boyfriend. The thoughts in her head are coming from first person POV. The majority of the story is told through an overall audience narrative. What we see is what happening. But that isn't always true. There were moments where the story was depicted through the core characters personality. It focuses mainly upon Norman's personality. We really feel what he is going through towards the end and we sympathize slightly as mother takes over his persona. Norman is the central character. His interaction with Marion drives his mother to take over his actions. His mother was a pivoting person in his life. He feels as if his mother won't let him live so his dominate personality takes over permanently at the end. The way everything ties in when it starts with going down a different road, literally. Marion faces choices in the beginning. Weighing of the good with the bad emphases each of her decisions. She has the choice to do the right thing, but she takes a risk and is cramped up into a corner. As soon as she decides to change her mind, she is stopped. Director Alfred Hitchcock shows us that things aren't what they seem just because you think you're doing the right thing for yourself. No matter how much you cover up the evidence, you will be caught and sentenced. The deaths are filmed just a painting come to life. When Detective Arboghast gets killed, he falls backward and we are propelled with him as he tumbles to the floor receiving repetitive stabbings from Norman as mother. Just because you know what is right from wrong, doesn't mean that somehow you'll be pardoned. In Arboghast's position, he read more into the problem and ultimately, that was what killed him. He knew too much and would have told Sam and Lila had he the chance if he wasn't stabbed.The POV in the film changes dramatically after Marion was stabbed. It was Norman's business from than on. The film drives us to believe the story is going to be about Marion when in fact, she was the trigger that set off Norman to be the main setting. But as Hitchcock shows us, Norman is an innocent in all of this. He was held captive by mother. She began dominating his actions more and more as the story progress. Another scene in which Hitchcock plays with POV was the scene where Norman was sitting in the station and asked for a blanket. A truly disturbing part of the scene in where he changed POV was when Norman's mother was complaining and blaming Norman for everything that happened to her. The final lines summed up the reasons why mother was so clever to get away with the things she got away with. ""They'll see and they'll say, 'Why, she wouldn't even hurt a fly!'"" It's a definitive film that means so many things but the main idea was that Hitchcock wanted to understand the main focus of the synopsis. Don't trust just anyone on the run. Truly the greatest terror film ever made!",Psycho
938,movieaddict_8,Classic,10,12 January 2014,"In my opinion, Psycho is what today's movies are not. You have to be watching the whole movie to know what's going on. Today's movies, you could glance at the screen every once in a while, and you could know what's going on. Not Psycho. Psycho keeps you at the edge of your seat, like why was the cop on to her? Is it going to be a big part of the movie? Why do they care so much that she was in a hurry? Loved every minute of it. The music, the ending, this movie should be studied upon by other horror directors! Horror is an art form, an Psycho is the Mona Lisa! So yeah, definitely watch it.",Psycho

940,sxjTheFirst,Whats all the fuss about,5,29 June 2005,"Whats the fuss about the movie anyways? I guess in it's it may have been a hit but when i saw it last year (2004) I was not impressed. The much talked about scary shower scene didn't even mildly startle me. Its a good movie but not sure why its considered a ""timeless classic"". My Dad was full of praise before we even started watching it. There was this last scene where it was meant to be ""all revealed"". I kind of guessed that Norman's mom was dead earlier and again it wasn't scary. I don't find skeletons and corpses on screen scary but then maybe its me coz I never am scared at the movies.The movie is basically good. Well directed, well acted and for its time it must have been technically sound too. But a classic? This seems a case of nostalgia and faddishness taking over in judging a movie than the movie itself. People seem to be rating ti based on what it meant to them than on if they like watching it NOW. If i have to see an old movie I would choose Streetcar Named Desire .",Psycho

It has no flaws what so ever and has some of the best performances in a film of all time. I am not a fan of horror movies which just proves how good a film this is! If you have not already seen this film I suggest you stop reading this and watch it right now! This film features what I consider the greatest twist of all time. It's even better than twists from films like Starwars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back, Planet of The Apes, The Usual Suspects and so on. You've Probably noticed all I'm doing is throwing a bunch of great things about the movie at you and that's because I feel this is the best way to explain the Masterpiece that is PSYCHO!",Psycho

The story is still good of course, that is the one thing that can defy time, but some other aspects are corroded. I don't wan't to leave spoilers and I think if you watch the movie you will understand what I mean, but this movie is worth a watch. What I like the most is that it is dynamic, meaning that the story is always progressing, no big dialogues, no boring stuff. There is romance in the movie, but just enough so that the story has a meaning. Acting is not realistic but theatrical, which is expected from movies from that period. This movie offers a lot of fun even though it is not as scary as it once was. Try and you won't regret it.",Psycho
943,SHBCinema,One of the Wonders of the Cinema,10,17 March 2018,"This film is amazing and can not be described with word. Director of the film director Alfred Hitchcock is directing the film and it's possible to say that he is one of the best directors of cinema history. He is very skilled in this work and uses every minute of the film, and if there is a sequence in his film, he is unreasonable and he will want to send a message to the viewer. In Psycho, there are no lost scenes from the moment the movie starts, until the movie ends. One of the surprises of this movie that puzzled me is the camera movements that make the movie exciting alone, and it's really great; for example, when Norman was talking to his mother in the room, the viewer was very curious and excited, The face of the killer's mother, but the camera does not allow us to do this, and by departing from Norman's mother's face, moving slowly upward and changing our viewing angle. Throughout the film, the viewer may guesses about the end of the film, but in any case, in the sequence Lila goes to the basement and sees the body of Norman's mother, the viewer is shocked, and everything happens so quickly that the viewer no longer has time to think and all his answers In less than a minute, this sequence is very attractive and exciting as the sequence of Marion's murder in the bathroom, and if you look at this sequence, you will not forget about it in your lifetime. The psycho film is not scary, it's so daunting, mysterious, and also full of excitement that the critics have likened to these fears.",Psycho

It was great, awesome. The ending was, at least to me, terribly shocking. Great plot twist. I also did not expect Marion to die so quickly! The shower scene was also great, very well organized, the shoots were amazing, with all the close ups and all. The acting was fantastic, Norman's character was very on point. Hitchcock did a really good job directing this movie. This was actually the first Hitchcok movie I've ever seen, and it definitely left me craving for more. Anyway, it may not look like a really good movie at first sight, but it is. So, yeah, everyone should watch it!",Psycho
945,junkmail-48566,The greatest thriller of them all!,10,26 July 2018,"Get over the concept that Hitchcock chose to film this in black and white! ""Psycho"" was made as a bet with Hitch's agent, Lew Wasserman, after both read an article in Variety that pointed out that an upstart company, American-International, was packing them into drive-in theaters to see low-budget horror films directed by Roger Corman. Hitch claimed he could make a better film than AIP for less money than they spent on a film, and Wasserman took him up on the bet. ""Psycho"" was made for $80,000 using Hitch's television crew instead of his usual cinematic crew. Hitch was always fussy about his leading ladies, and he selected Janet Leigh for the role of Marion Crane, who agreed to play the role for half her usual salary. Anthony Perkins however, as Norman Bates, is the central character of the film, and while his interaction with Marion is minimal, he will forever be remembered for his performance here. Vera Miles, one of Hitchcock's favorite actresses, plays Marion's sister Lila, creating tension over her concern for her sister's well-being. Of Hitchcock's total body of works, ""Psycho"" is the film that stands out in most fan's minds as his greatest. Everyone involved here did their absolute best, and the results are obvious on the screen. The only flaw in the film is the distortion heard in Bernard Hermann's music score. The score exists by itself without the film and is available on LaserDisc, LP and CD, however it's distorted on every medium. Hermann re-recorded the score as a suite for a 1969 Decca/London Phase 4 stereo vinyl release called ""Music from the Great Movie Thrillers."" The LP has been reissued on CD as ""Great Hitchcock Movie Thrillers"" and lacks the distortion of the mono recording in the film. SPOILER: Of note to trivia fans is that the sound effect of the knife used in the famous shower scene was created by using a Cassaba melon, and in no shot of the rapid 45 pieces of film fired at the viewers does a knife penetrate Marion Crane on-camera, and the effect of the blood running down the drain is actually Bosco chocolate syrup.",Psycho

The two movies that affected me most as a child were: ""The Amityville Horror"" (I've had more dreams about that house than any other thing..ever!) and ""Psycho"". After watching ""Psycho"", I never viewed ANYTHING as being 100% safe. No castles, no zombies, no monsters. Normal people in risky situations exposed before all. Everyone has skeletons in their closets. Even those who seem to be as harmless as a fly. (Such as Norman Bates). This movie not only changed the course of movie history, by killing off the apparent heroine 1/3 of the way through the film (making history) but, proved that their was absolutely NOWHERE to be totally safe. It revealed inner demons of the two main characters which reflect on the entire world and maybe the truest description of how the world really is.

I would certainly see it on the silver screen, perhaps along with countless other ""PSYCHO"" fans across the WORLD.

(There are a few spoilers here.) Horror films usually leave you cold and chilled and as shocking and disturbing Psycho is, it's a film you can somehow warm to. The shower scene is a scene like no other.  Its more shocking than frightening, the instant when the curtain draws back and you are faced with a shadowy figure clutching a knife sucks the adrenalin out you like a sponge, after Marion is viciously stabbed she clutches the shower curtain and falls to the floor, so simple yet so powerful. The full story which is one that you really need to know nothing about to get the full affect.  Unfortunately I knew quite a bit about it before I saw it.  If there ever was a film with a plot twist this film would top the list. If you haven't seen it then go, go, go and rent it now, in fact buy it !  You won't be disappointed.",Psycho
952,hveiti,"Legendary, in both a good and a bad way",10,27 November 2000,"Not much to be said about this that hasn't been said before.  Only the second Hitchcock film I've ever seen, and so far there isn't a single positive thing that's been said about him that I can disagree with. Calling someone 'The Master' is terminology that I would usually frown upon as being too dismissive of other greatly talented people, but after witnessing the directing, the cinematography, the subtle performances, the inimitable atmosphere and the quiet genius of this masterpiece, I find myself forced to agree.  The notorious shower scene manages to be shocking, brutal and understated all at once, and its infamy on the pages of motion picture history is well-deserved.  Anthony Perkins is subtly explosive, like a match waiting to be struck.  He plays Bates with a boyish, grinning charm that generally belies his chilling insanity.  Also worthy of mention is Bernard Herrmann's incredible score, possibly one of the best I've ever heard.In a curious way, the one thing I find disagreeable about this movie is, indeed, its legend.  I cannot imagine how much I would have enjoyed it had I not known any of the plot twists beforehand, and could have gone into it unknowingly.  Still, perhaps somewhat paradoxically, the legend is completely due, because this film's merit becomes obvious when you consider that first-time viewers of my generation (I'm 21 years old), who have become inundated with the blood, gore and overblown special effects of today's blockbusters, can still find its subtle ingenuity chilling and scary in equal measure.  Beautiful. 10/10",Psycho

As always with Hitchcock's movies, this one looks better with every time. What more can I say that hasn't already been said? The direction is amazing (and very much ahead of its time), Bernard Herman's score is possibly the best piece of music written for a motion picture, a true work of art(and it's a pity there is not a soundtrack album out) and of course Perkins' performance is totally out of this world. And forget about the famous (and too much copied) shower scene, or the detective's murder; the most horrifying scene is the one at the end where Norman Bates sits alone, thinking  his mother's  thoughts, and then gives to the camera THAT look- it has me scared sh**less every time I see it.

Only Hitchcock could make this film a classic. With only two murders, it is infinitely scarier than any of these slasher films with a murder every two seconds.  This movie was not about the murders, although that was what you were lead to believe by the first murder.  This film was, for lack of a better term, a horrifying character study.  This film will go down in history and be remembered forever for it.  It should never have been remade, and one can only hope that perhaps someday they will re-release it into theaters.",Psycho

It still holds the capability to shock, and even scare a modern audience. The only problem with the film is that, for my personal taste, it is too dark (which is why I prefer Rear Window, it's a much lighter movie) and this laves me with an ugly feeling. However, it is still fast-paced and entertaining. I do consider this movie the most well done for the following reasons: 1. Janet Leigh-HUGE star for her time. Killed off in the middle of the movie.2. Hitchcock spread rumors about casting the mother...who is actually dead.I could go on. But, to boil it all down, he misleads the audience, increasing in their involvement. Truly a masterpiece.",Psycho
957,heverett-10426,Classic Hitchcock Horror Film,10,22 August 2020,"Psycho, directed by Alfred Hitchcock remains one of the most influential horror movies of all time. Every single slasher movie that followed owes a huge debt to Psycho. Apart from pioneering the genre, Psycho is my favorite horror movie of all time. The plot is very unpredictable. In the first third of the movie, Janet Leigh is introduced as the typical Hitchcock protagonist; an average person pulled into the world of crime. We are led to believe that the movie will revolve around the $40,000 she stole from her boss. However, around the halfway mark, Hitchcock subverts our expectations and kills off Leigh in the now legendary shower scene. The unexpectedness of the scene. the quick editing and the shrill Bernard Herrmann score are what make this scene so effective. As for the $40,000, Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins, disposes of it while cleaning up the body. This brings me to another great part of the movie, Anthony Perkins' character. He plays his character as a shy, dutiful mama's boy trapped by his authoritarian mother. We genuinely believe that he is just a dutiful son cleaning up after his psychotic mother till the end. The final twist is a great example of Hitchcock's control over his audience. Due to his expert direction and Perkins' performance, we fail to see the obvious. Easily one of Hitchcock's greatest films.",Psycho

959,blueginkoh,A Masterclass in Suspense,9,14 January 2021,"Hitchcock has always been credited for his ability to create incredibly suspenseful scenes in his films, and Psycho is a great example of this.
Utilizing close ups that make the viewer feel boxed in, uncommon lighting scenarios that accentuate subtle features of the face to just slightly distort them and give off the uneasy feeling of looking at something familiar and yet unfamiliar, and some excellent framing and blocking, Hitchcock creates a timeless thriller masterpiece that had me absolutely hooked.
Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is amazing as well; he creates this unsettling air about him that is noticeable immediately upon first meeting him.
Of course, there is also the famous bathtub drain to eye transition in this film, which has to be mentioned as one of the best match cuts in cinema history.The very few issues I had with the movie are mostly just that the film starts off a bit slow in the beginning, and that the ending fell a little flat for me, although these are basically just nitpicks.

It was good to watch such a classic horror movie in October and also to see how movies have progressed through the years in Hollywood. The ending is also just great and very iconic.

961,jamesbutterford,THE Most Influential Movie of All Time,10,31 May 2010,"I challenge you to think of a more influential movie than Alfred Hitchcock's psycho. Such a movie does not exist.Psycho created its own genre: Sure, there were monster, killer, and ""horror"" movies prior to 1960, but Psycho is the first actually good one. All pre-Psycho films are merely proto-horror movies. People still watch Psycho and, importantly, they still watch it as a horror movie. When people watch Frankenstein or Dracula, they are watching it for A) a laugh, or B) because it's famous. While Dracula and Frankenstein might sell in cheap monster movie box sets, Psycho still sells as a movie on its own, and to a wide and diverse audience that includes kids, adults, cinema lovers, and nacho lovers. No need to mention that every horror movie since Psycho is inspired by Psycho. This brings us to the next point...Psycho is still a little bit scary: At its release, this movie had people screaming and throwing up. This does not happen anymore, but VERY few movies can legitimately scare people for more than a few years after they're released. I'm not claiming that Psycho is still legitimately scary, but compare it to more recent horror movies such as Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street. Those movies are also no longer scary, and Psycho is in fact (in my opinion) scarier to a modern audience. Thus, it has stood the test of time as well as one could hope.The music: you all know it, your grandma knows it, and your 4-year old knows it. How many movies have stolen this score almost note for note?One last thing. Critics everywhere regard Psycho as a masterpiece, but often include a little clause about the psychiatrist scene and how it's out of place. I'll admit that when I first watched the movie, I was petrified when the psychiatrist started his speech because I, too, thought that this would be the undoing of a would-be masterpiece. However, my fears were not realized. Every time I've watched the movie since, I actually enjoy this scene and I don't feel the need to justify it by saying, ""Oh, people back then needed this kind of scene to make sense of the movie and it's just dated now."" No, I can 100% truthfully say that I think the scene adds to the movie, and I consider myself brutally honest when it comes to Hitchcock movies, even though I am a fan. I feel that Vertigo, Shadow of a Doubt, and Notorious are all overrated and have problems, but not Psycho.",Psycho
962,Pteromysvolans,Best horror movie of all times??,6,7 November 2003,"Sorry, but I've never understood why ""Psycho"" is considered by so many people to be the best horror movie of all times (I give it only 7/10). Very influental it is, yes. Maybe also I've just seen a bit too many dozens of mass murderer movies based more or less on ""Psycho"", that the original doesn't feel so special anymore?I think that a good movie must stand time and can be watched many times over and over again. Why should one want to watch ""Psycho"" again? The plot is so easy to guess even when seeing the movie first time that I find there not too much excitement.What's the plot and idea of this movie? Some nut just goes killing innocent people, because he's crazy, and that's the whole story. Period. Scary? Well, as much as irrational violence is scary.I also find it disgusting that in many horror movies psychotic people are often portrayed as the cause of all evil, when most of them are only very sick and mostly not particularly harmful to anyone. What is really scary - in real life or on a film - are people basically having everything ok and a good mental health, but still often doing horrible things, including irrelevant violence. Most violence in the world is done by such ""normal"" people.I think that Hitchcock has many better movies than ""Psycho"". For example ""Rear Window"" is a true classic in its minimalism, though maybe not particularly scary, at least in the way modern horror movies playing mainly on special effects are. Anyway, there you have just an ordinary guy, could be your nextdoor neighbour, who cruelly kills his wife etc., Now that's a scary idea, and the plot makes you think too.",Psycho

It think it's one of the worst movies of Hitchcock.I say again,the movie is good,but it didn't reach the intention: it's not horror. A weak spot is that the movie is filmed in black& white,and it's very very old. ""The shower scene"" is not convincing,and i don't understand why it's so famous.

Now, PSYCHO is only for people from that era or the people from movie-making business.It has got few thrills but it is nothing compared to horror/thriller movies made these days.It surely did sound great in 1960's but now if anyone tries to see it for the first time as I did then I assure you, you will be regretting why you even rented or bought it.

966,gck-31751,A cleverly made psychological thriller film which can take audience wherever Hitchcock wants.,10,13 November 2015,"First of all I was disappointed to see the movie in B&W. But, after watching the movie I can clearly understand why Hitchcock had chosen B&W over colour. If you are also thinking like me, don't care about the colour just watch this.If you don't, you are just giving up on the ""mother"" of all modern horror movies. No movie lover will take a risk of not watching Psycho. The cinema begins normally, in Phoenix, Arizona. The lead actress was a worker in a real-estate service corporation. She stole $40,000, which she had to put in bank and decides to leave the city. When she was driving, there must be scenes at her office and home to be shown. All we expect was to see those but not the face of the actress, but Hitchcock made a remarkable history to just show what is really needed. This makes you realize the mastery of Hitchcock. A psychological thriller which people didn't see till 1960, remains unaltered in its image.This connects to our minds directly. Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), the owner of Bates Motel and a Momma's boy looks like a friendly person. His action really brought the movie to life. An great movie which makes us predict what happens next, but deceives us every time in a HONEST way. Coming to the part which contributed majorly to the movie's success, MUSIC. Bernard Herrmann's score is quintessential. The music he gave makes the movie appealing at the most famous scene ""Shower Scene"". The most frightening scene is the out-of-nowhere murder of the Private Investigator. The music helped a lot here too. By continuously shocking the audience, Hitchcock took the movie in his direction, righteously. At the end, the audience will be shocked again and this is most horrifying too.",Psycho

After all, some movies are lauded as the best just because of their age. This is not one of those films.Hitchcock set the standard for plot twists and suspense with this film. The suspense throughout the film was fantastic, and the main leads were extraordinary in their acting. The film isn't necessarily scary in a ""slash em up"" sense, but also in a psychological sense. The dark twists and turns of the movie, along with solid acting, a plot that knows when to wrap up, among many other things, makes this a must see.",Psycho

976,Jerry_Horne,Technique that defined an art,9,8 January 2001,"This definitely contains **SPOILERS**, and is intended only for those who have seen the film, although it's hard to imagine many of you out there who haven't already seen this remarkable film.Let's start with what is probably the most amazing scene in the film, the conversation between Norman and Marian in the motel office parlor. Anyone interested in learning how to develop dramatic, and/or psychological tension, should study this scene. Sharp dialog, mood swings, marvelous camera angles and great character reactions permeate the scene. Much of the scene, and it's darkly humorous lines, hint at the truth about Norman and his mother without actually revealing it. For example, as Norman is bringing the tray of food into the office for Marian after an argument with mother, he says, ""My mother is ...what's the phrase...she isn't quite herself today"". In the parlor while Marian eats, Norman defends his mother with, ""We all go a little mad sometimes"". And just before Marian leaves the office she tells Norman, ""I stepped into a private trap back there. I'd like to go back and pull myself out of it...if it's not too late"". The irony being that Marian may have decided to try to escape her trap, but she has already, unknowingly been ensnared in Norman's private trap. Yes Marian, it is too late.In another sequence while Norman and Marian are talking in the parlor, the camera is at eye level on both characters. Suddenly, when Marian brings up the subject of Norman's mother, the camera angle changes. Norman is now being viewed from a lower angle. We are looking up at Norman and, in the background, his stuffed owl with it's wings spread, clearly in an attack posture. At the same time, we are now seeing Marian at slight downward angle. Norman has become the predator and Marian the prey!Now, how about lighting? In a scene very near the end of the film, Marian's sister has made her way into the fruit cellar, lit by one bare bulb, where mother sits in a wheelchair. Lila touches her shoulder, the wheelchair swings around revealing mother's well preserved corpse. Lila screams and draws her hand back hitting the light bulb, causing it to swing wildly. The end result is that the remainder of the scene is played out in alternating light and shadow due to the swinging bulb: Lila's terrified face, mother's corpse, Norman running into the cellar in mother's clothes wielding a butcher's knife, Sam running in behind Norman and dragging him to the floor, Norman's face becoming a twisted mask of despair as the knife falls to the floor and the wig slips from his head. It all has the look of a nightmare...macabre, surreal, and sheer genius!I have always loved Hitch's brand of humor, dark or otherwise. Here are some of my favorites from this film: Marian talking to Sam in the motel room at the beginning of the film, ""You make respectability sound...disrespectful"". Charlie the used car salesman, speaking to Marian, who is obviously intent on trading in her car, ""First time I ever saw the customer high pressure the salesman"". Arbogast, the private detective, speaking to Norman at the motel, ""If it doesn't gel, it isn't aspic...and this ain't gelling"". Norman speaking to Sam, after Sam has implied that Marian may have made a fool of him, ""She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother"". Lila to Sam, defending her decision to try to talk to Norman's mother, ""I can handle a sick, old woman"". How about the fact that Norman's hobby is stuffing birds, and in cleaning up mother's mess he stuffs a ""Crane"" into the trunk of a car. Classic Hitch!Let me leave you with one last tidbit. In the final scene of the film Norman is sitting in a cell, wrapped in a blanket, and we hear mother's thought that is the last line of the film, ""Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly"". The scene then dissolves to a shot of Marian's car being dragged from the swamp. Just as Norman's image disappears from the screen, look closely and you will see the face of mother's corpse superimposed over Norman's face for a fraction of a second. One last little (subliminal?) chill from the master! I can see you all rushing to your VCR's now. Enjoy!",Psycho

978,Ahmed_Abdellatif,"A masterpiece, once upon a time",8,14 December 2013,"The movie has a great story writing and quite an ambitious and experimental directing of its time,worthy of Alfred Hitchcock. However it failed to be the timeless masterpiece it is promoted to be, as other titles by Hitchcock like ""Dail M for murder"" as an example. The acting is done in a theatrical, grandiose method that takes off some of the thrill and immersion, as well as the setting which makes everyone ridiculously well dressed and in best shape. In a sense you can't believe a handsome young man who dresses and speaks as royalty can run a shady motel or work in a hardware store, but it happens in the movie consistently which is quite disengaging. Even a psychiatrist speaks in more of a literary manner rather than a scientific one as one should. That was a trend of the time, so it can be forgiven,however it makes the movie end a bit flat and the characters lack connection. This movie is one of those movies that laid the ground to many likes afterwards but fell short of being a masterpiece itself",Psycho

981,bradman-neelabh,THE greatest horror movie ever made.,10,17 February 2007,"A very natural, or unnatural and unpredictable movie about Norman, the owner of Bates Motel and his mother. Truly Hitchcock's greatest ever.Well it starts off when Marion Crane, an employed woman is given duty by her office to carry $40000 to a place. She sees this as her best opportunity to change life forever and live it up to the most. Like any other cunning human being, Marion steals the money and heads to Phoenix in Arizona. On the way, she is forced to change her car to avoid any suspicions by anybody about the crime she's just committed, as the thought goes through her mind every minute. Somehow managing to exchange her car to a pre-owned one, she carries on when suddenly there is a huge storm and finds no other choice but to stop nearby at Bates Motel near the highway, an isolated place. The owner of the motel, Norman Bates escorts her to her room and even offers to have dinner with him. The two have a long conversation, Norman mostly talking about himself and his dear old mother. Marion listens with interest and finally ends up going back to her room for a shower, where the story begins....Remarkably the greatest horror or thriller movie ever made, Hitch's best.

983,Ashes_fayded,Technique,10,27 March 2008,"The whole movie, in my opinion, was very well thought out. Alfred H. began the uses of bringing the viewer into the show, rather than having them just view it. The scene in the movie where Norman Bates (playing his mother) begins to stab the woman in the shower is most interesting to me. Not because of the great sound effects but the set up itself. When Norman begins to stab the woman, notice how he holds the knife, notice how he stabs downward. It is statistically known that when men stab with a knife they hold it in such a way where they stab upward. Women on the other hand stab downward. I like to think that Hitchcock was genius enough and thorough enough to add this technique into the movie. Norman was dressed as his mother, therefore, was in complete character to stab like a woman.",Psycho

Not that it isn't great, maybe I'm one of those 1 out of 100 people not to be fazed by this film. As the title of the film suggest, I anticipated the twist and it the part which is supposed to 'blow your mind' was way too predictable for me. But top notch direction again.

989,mitchellwellstead,Quite simply the greatest horror ever made,10,2 June 2010,"Firstly, I have a love/hate relationship with the horror genre. My previous encounters consisted of a few dozen snickers to my viewing partner about how the film was ridiculously unrealistic and could never happen, and that furthermore, it wasn't really scary because I knew what was coming. This leads to my main problem with the genre: I am an expert at discerning the plot climax well before it happens. This is a massive problem, because it takes away the suspense.Just a heads up, I will not be spoiling anything here, I'll just describe the setting and characters. Nothing story orientated. Anyway, so imagine my surprise when I finally decided to jump into the last of the main four Hitchcock films: Psycho.The film differentiates itself from Rear Window (1954) in more ways that one. Namely; its been filmed in black & white, the setting is purposely lower class and it focuses even more on the psychological rather than the physical. The villain might not have the razor sharp fingers of Freddy Kruger, or the deep seeded hatred of Jigsaw, but he/she is made infinitely more malevolent through the twists and turns conveyed by the director. What makes this villain so much scarier than all the rest? He or she's an inherently plausible evildoer; one who could be sitting right next to you while you watch the film for all you know. The horror of Hitchcock's masterpiece is that it forces you to question whether this could happen to you.The filmography might not be as good as Vertigo (1958), but it's certainly up there, and easily the defining work of the genre. It seems somewhat like Sin City in it's technical codes, the director obviously had the capacity to use color, but he chose to use black & white, why is that I wonder? The lack of color (and the associated filmic codes) isn't a drawback, it's done to keep you ignorant of the horrors to come. In many ways 'Psycho' feels like a last tribute to the genre, but in reality it's simply a new beginning, like Clint Eastwood's 1993 epic 'Unforgiven' was for the Western genre.Hitchcock makes you believe you ARE one of the protagonists. His use of lighting is fantastic: dark scenes preclude a twist, and every time he shows one you tremble in fear, and try to figure out what's going to happen. There's no point. The film is crafted so eloquently that the vast majority of people won't figure it out until well into it, at which point you're not annoyed that you've figured out the main plot element, but rather you become much more involved.This is a masterpiece, and 'Psycho' is one of the few films that'll have you telling yourself that over and over again while you watch it.",Psycho
990,antos,The World's Number One,10,17 April 2003,"First time I watched Psycho when I was fifteen. For me it was a really true movie, because I have also a mother with some despotic states of mind, like Norman. Of course not so horrible, but I can emphathise with Norman very well. From that first watching Hitchcock has become my most favorite director, and I suppose he will always be.Psycho was the complement of almost forty years of his movie-direction work and he took advantage of what he had learnt during the whole cinematographic time. From the silent season where the modern film tricks were not available, through the black-and-white film-noir epoch where metaphysics was essential, until the birth of technics in the time of wide-screen technicolor.I can still listen to Bernard Herrmann's schizophrenic music against a background of the schizo-designed titles, as well as I can still see all the great scenes of the movie, even as I watched it more than twenty times.Anthony Perkins interpreted the performance which is in my opinion the best I have ever seen. And I really know what is behavior, motion and gestures of a boy in a family with a despotic mother, as I mentioned.Some people do not like Psycho because there are some horrible scenes. But they do not take account that the real artist cannot be fashionable. Psycho is one of those movies where the artistic beauty is in everything, included the horrible scenes. And everything in this picture has a sense.For me Psycho is the best movie I have ever watched, and it will probably be the best forever.",Psycho
991,Dr_MIX,The first of a kind,9,10 February 2008,"I had always avoided watching Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho due to its age and how our media has ridiculed its famous shower scene for the past forty years. I just thought I would not be able to take it seriously. However, as I was watching it, I was fully immersed in its world and I couldn't look away. Many criticise it for its somewhat slow pace, I supposed that's to be expected from my generation, who are used to watching quickly paced Michael Bay trash. But I didn't find this film to be terrifying like many believe it is, though I suppose that's because I don't carry that nostalgia of having grown up with this film and also because when it was first released, it was the first if it's kind. ""Slasher"" films had scarcely been done in 1960, but now there are at least two released each week. The lighting in Psycho is terrific; it really made me uneasy in the scenes in which Norman Bates was talking to Marion Crane because the lighting is so atmospherically creepy, especially in relations to the shadows the stuffed birds emitted. Alfred Hitchcock did an amazing job at building suspense as well. I was on the edge of my seat up until the shower scene, it felt like the climax, halfway through the film, and things sort of trailed afterwards I find. Anthony Perkin's acting abilities really impressed me, how he could easily switch between his multiple personas all the while still showing us that there is a crazy man behind all his facial expressions of friendliness was fantastic. The score was extremely well written and the composer really connected the visuals to the music in a way that made the viewer uneasy. However, the actual killings weren't well executed in my humble opinion, they felt more unintentionally comedic than frightening, and I'm sure it wasn't Hitchcock's intention for viewers to feel this way. But back in 1960, I'm sure audiences were scared out of their minds, but by today's standards, explicit gore is more common and the killings in Psycho felt a bit weak. It was an excellent film nevertheless 9/10",Psycho
992,tanmayshlok90,A class apart from its time.,8,28 April 2016,"It took me lot of convincing to watch another black and white movie but this movie was totally worth it. A film like this takes you to inexplicable journey of human relations and shows in as simple way as possible.The movie is interesting and keeps you glued from your chair. The directorial style of Hitchcock spellbinds you once you are halfway through the film. The starting of film seems pretty slow but as the movie keeps on going, it reveals an unorthodox relation between a son and his dominating mother thus giving a viewers a complete worth of their time. In all it's a movie one should watch to explore the extent of domination in a relationship.",Psycho
993,rabidrobertfan,Mother Knows Best...,9,24 March 2014,"Still considered a ground-breaking film today, Psycho shocked audiences when it was released back in 1960 because they had never before seen a graphic murder scene shot with such brutality, intensity and at the same time discretion. Though the infamous ""shower scene"" does not reveal a plunging knife nor a single bare breast, it still manages to be unsettling nonetheless due to its sheer realism and plausibility. The plot of Psycho comes with many twists and turns and is pretty unpredictable seeing as how it starts out very simple. A Phoenix secretary steals forty thousand dollars and takes off. But when she runs into Norman Bates, the peculiar owner of a small motel who is very attached to his invalid mother, things get complicated. The acting in this movie is nothing less than phenomenal. Janet Leigh does not have a large role but still was able to make the most of it. As previously stated, the acting is phenomenal-in the case of Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, a little too phenomenal. I felt he truly could have been a great actor-had it not been for his disturbingly convincing performance in Psycho. He makes you believe he really is a psychopath. Perhaps one of the most disturbing moments in the film is when he stares directly at the viewer, his eyes glowing with evil mischievousness. Psycho is a disturbing but interactive film that tests the viewer's knowledge. Shot in gritty black-and-white, the cinematography only adds to the unsettling nature but it also adds to the artistry of it as well. When one tallies up its great acting, haunting atmosphere and twisting plot, it is easy to see why Psycho is ranked amongst the greatest films ever made.",Psycho
994,vishnu-mmenon,its quite good a watch,7,20 July 2013,"Psycho English, 1960 Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller Direction: Alfred Hitchcock Cast: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, Janet Leigh, Martin Balsam, John Gavin IMDb: 8.6/10A movie is called a classic when the story it tells still remains valid even years after it was released. In that sense, master director Alfred Hitchcock's psychological thriller is very easily a classic. What starts seemingly as a satire on human behavior, quite unexpectedly changes gears and becomes a crime thriller. There are moments where one actually holds his breath. The plot goes like this: A Phoenix secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. The story initially revolves around this secretary, Marion (Janet Leigh), but drifts after some point of time. I won't discuss too much about the story in my reviews as I myself hate to know the story of a movie before watching it. The background music is quite fitting. Psycho's definitely worth your 1 hour and 48 minutes.",Psycho

There is only one bit of this movie i didn't fully understand (and I may sound completely dumb for mentioning it, it's probably something rather easy to understand!) but in the film, the male hotel keeper carry's his mother down the stairs after asking her to hide and you can see him carry his mother down stairs but later on in the movie the policeman says he dressed up as his mother and acted like her etc? If that's so, who was the women that he carried down the stairs? All in all, it's an alright movie, most of the women really reminded me of Marilyn Monroe It's a good old horror though! :)",Psycho
997,kekesholmes,Psycho Review,9,14 October 2015,"WOW is all I can say . At first I wasn't into it because I thought it might be boring because of the black and white, but I'm glad that I stayed tuned to uncover mistaken identities and truth. Marion Crane played an astonishing role as a pretty, innocent, lovely woman, disguising her mischief. Although she had stole money I hoped for her to get away safely. Unfortunately she encounters a dangerous person, Norman Bates, who although is by far the most disturbed person, he has to be my favorite character. He made his role believable, shocking the audience with his dark, mentally illed mind when he turned out to be acting as his mother when all the while she was dead for years. All alone, he made it seem like there were two people in that house where he stayed. Confused, Marion was in for the worst from the beginning and her death was tragic. The killer was definitely a mystery until the end when you find out it was Norman acting as his deceased jealous mother. This movie was crazy, it was exciting after the murder because everyone thought Marion had ran away with the money. Norman kept his cool around her family when they came looking for her, until her sister discovers his mother's dead body in the basement and Norman is forced to reveal himself as the real killer, of his mother, and Marion. It's kind of creepy that he does this, but I love the acting and the multi tasking that he does , and how he leads the audience on to believe the mother was actually alive and killed her. This is a great movie, I loved it . It's a good example of mystery and thriller. Although it is a older movie it is a good modern story because Norman's sickness is a modern disease.",Psycho

Second I really liked the idea , he is a schizophreniac who dresses like his mother because he misses her and feels guilty about killing her, but wasn't it better if the detective in the end didn't tell all the stuff about him they was too evidently. They had to let us think a lil bit.
Third why the movie started with a scene of this woman when she died so soon and what happens with the money and why did she wanted to steal them. It was unexpected to kill her, first I though that she is the psycho. And like the whole movie was centered about her, like she is the psycho.

1000,bostonmania2002,We're all caught in our private traps...,9,20 October 2007,"""We're all caught in our private traps, we scratch and claw at the air, at each other, but for all of it, we never budge an inch"".Yes, ""Psycho"" is missing the vibrancy of ""North by Northwest"", vividity of ""Vertigo"", ambiguity of ""The Birds"", and claustrophobia of ""Rear Window"", but it is a unique movie in its very own league. With Hitchcock's sharp eye with little details, genius camera angles, and keen sense of generating suspense and tension, ""Psycho"" is multi-layered and richly-textured film, actually this is Master's last great picture.The film starts out very slowly. During the first hour, Hitchcock focuses on a single specific event and takes the viewer somewhat familiar point mostly seen in classic film noirs: a confused woman, being stuck in an impasse with a lover bogged down in financial woes, steals money off her employer. Things becomes to go awry en route California (where her lover lives), while she encounters some ""MacGuffins"" such as a mysterious patrolman and suspicious used-car salesman, both are the harbingers of incipient tension and terror. Her edgy trip ends in a sleazy motel off the main highway in a rainy night. Hitchcock startles the viewer while central female antagonist dies half-way through the film, and takes us another sinister place where the real secret is revealed. From this point, Anthony Perkins lead the show as twitchy motel keeper with peculiar idiosyncrasies. This is the role of his life, as everybody is waiting horrified whenever this schizoid time bomb will go off.From the very beginning, Hitchcock imbues the film with a heavy atmosphere of impending doom. Blood-chilling strings of composer Bernard Herrmann adds greatly to the overall moodiness. Today's horror/thrillers depend too much on graphic violence, where blood, gore, decapitations, and dismembered bodies galore. Not overly violent and with almost no blood and gore, the unshakable effectiveness ""Psycho"" mutters up comes from what is implied, but not shown. He always used to make the audience use their imagination. This is the greatness of Hitchcock.Now for the downside, I found the second half of the film somewhat forced. Private eye Arbogast's insatiable obsession with Norman and his ill mother is totally unconvincing. Lila's (Marion's sister) intuition about something bad had happened in the motel is groundless. Sam and Lila's visit to the motel and their sureness about Marion's stay in room number 1 is totally implausible. Also, the secret of the film is predictable half-way through, as soon as all the pieces are put in proper places. But, neither of these weak points undermine the cleverness and effectiveness of this great piece of cinema. ""Psycho"" is definitely a classic and deserves to be called so.",Psycho

1002,JoshJa,"Cool movie, but old",10,28 December 1998,"Although the old movie may turn some people off due to the fact that it's in black and white, this actually an easy movie to follow.Considered a classic by many, people who haven't seen it yet may be surprised when they see how the shower scene was shot (they may have pictured it differently in their mind).Oh, by the way, if you haven't seen it yet, it's better to see the remake first THEN the orginal, instead of the original first, then the remake. That way, you will appreciate both films more.P.S.- I have no idea why they had Anne Heche play Marion Crane on the remake instead of Pamela Anderson.",Psycho
1003,BeamMeUp,"Creepy, Excellent, and Amazing Horror Flick! Best Thriller Ever!!",10,4 November 1998,"The first time I saw this movie it scared me incredibly.  I have been an avid fan of the ""Scream"" movies since they first came out, and I must say, this movie surpasses them to be #1 on my favorite horror movies.I wasn't expecting many scares from a movie made in 1960, but once again, Alfred Hitchcock proves why he is the Master of Suspense.I don't know how the upcoming remake can accurately mimic the original's creepy and frightening feeling, but I'll still be there on opening weekend. BTW, make sure you watch the original BEFORE watching the remake.I know you've heard it a thousand times, but if you haven't seen this movie, MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY!  It's simply incredible.",Psycho

This movie has always been my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie of all time with Vertigo being at #2. Psycho also happens to be my favorite slasher movie of all time. This movie ought to be the very first movie that kick-started the whole notion of a protagonist potential victim and an antagonist killer / stalker kind of trend in movies. Some of the greatest slasher movies of all time including Halloween, Friday the 13th, A Nightmare on Elm Street etc were unequivocally influenced by the blueprint Hitchcock had left behind through Psycho. If it wasn't for Psycho, none of these movies would exist. 10/10 for this Slasher masterpiece from me.",Psycho

1011,Cornpick,An intelligent thriller/horro,7,19 July 2007,"As with most very old films, Psycho is unlikely to have the same impact on a modern audience than it had upon its first release. So those who are watching it expecting the 'masterpeice' they are often told it is, prepare to be disappointed. Having said that, if you take Psycho of its pedestal as 'one of the greatest films of all time' (though through a historical perspective and in terms of influence, the title is richly deserved' and watch it treat it for what it is, a psychological horror, than the film remains very enjoyable. The acting performance put on by Anthony Perkins is highly believable and at times chilling and, if you have not been exposed to the shows twists and ending already, they still have the potential to shock and surprise even the most seasoned horror fan. On the subject of horror fans, it is worth a watch on that merit alone or for any fan of cinema, to see the film that has shaped cinema today more than almost any other film",Psycho

There is not a single fault in the movie, except the title which reveals some of the suspense. But still it is one of the best horror/thriller. There aren't many killings in the movie but one single killing should scare you enough of a lifetime.It just looks like such a simple runaway movie but just explodes suddenly into a real horror movie. The acting was superb from perkins. He just seems at so much ease changing from scared young man to a violent killer. The remaining cast did really well, but they are just so easily outdone by perkins acting. The background score was excellent, it keeps the thrill during the small amounts of silence in the movie. You can just keep watching it again and again and would still be mesmerised with action every time.",Psycho
1013,mistern2@zipmail.com,Best Film Ever Made !,10,22 October 2002,"Psycho is the best film ever made ! I´ve no doubt about it ! It´s perfect ! The direction is perfect and it passes to the viewer the sensation of the bizarre , the suspense , the mystery and the dark mood as Hitchcock pretended to show. It´s a real shocker !The screenplay is out of this world ! Joseph Stefano is a genius ! He and Mr. Hitchcock tricked us ! Everybody thought that It was a film about Marion Crane , a girl confused about her relationship with Sam Loomis , that decides to steal forty thousand dollars ! So we try to figure out how was she going to handle the situation ! But It ain´t the main point anyway ! Joseph and Hitchcock gave us a bait and we bit it !This movie is well remembered by the very imitated shower scene ! Hitchcock (with the help of Saul Bass) designed it and used montage in this scene and it worked very well !This film would not be the same without Mr. Hitchcock (off course) , Joseph Stefano and more two people : Bernard Herrmann and Anthony Perkins !Bernard Herrmann composed an ""all made of strings"" dark music to Psycho and at nowadays it´s suspense synonymous ! It´s brilliant ! My personal favorite song is in that scene when Marion decides to steal the money and she is making her baggage ! By the way , that shot was a masterpiece too ! Hitchcock told us everything without a word (as in the beginning of Rear Window) , just showing the baggage , the money and Marion´s face ! Amazing ! Thrilling !Anthony Perkins gave us the best interpretation in a motion picture ever ! Norman Bates is a very well developed character ! Tony is great as the fragile boy dominated by his crazy mother ! He has a strange glamour that make us believe that he´s innocent and he´s trying to hide the truth about his mother ! You still thinking : ""It can´t be ! He seems to be a good man !"".It´s hard to me to describe the film that changed my life and the way I watched movies ... I didn´t know that a picture could be art ! I´m fanatic for this film ! If you have a chance , RENT IT , BUY IT , STEAL IT ... Whatever !  :)Rating : Perfect.",Psycho
1014,Hejarnold,Greatly overestimated,5,8 October 2003,"This film is very overestimated just as so many other film-classics. It's certainly not a bad film but it's not worth the high ranking. Maybe Hitchcock was a pioneer in his genre and important for future horror-film-directors. But this is not a reason to still love the film. Also worth mentioning is the acting (not realistic) and the technical aspects (the photography isn't that good) which for their time of course wasn't that bad, but compared to, for ex. ""The Shining"" (#87 in the IMDB top 250) is lousy. In the end the film isn't that scary. I recommend ""Dark Water"" (or ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara"") by Hideo Nakata if you want something scary. Maybe Hitchcock WAS a genius, but his films are outdated like Jesse Owens world-records.",Psycho
1015,ladygamer1,Hitch at his best...a preview of things to come,8,17 November 2002,"Having grown-up in the late 70's and early 80's watching such ""scary movies"" as ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Holloween"" and of course ""Friday the 13th"", I thought I knew what scary was, that is until I saw Psycho.Psycho was the only movie that truly scared me, because something like that could really happen.  :::::Spoiler coming:::::Let's face it Norman Bates was Ted Bundy, the Hillside Strangler and the Son of Sam all wrapped up in a neat little albeit warped package!  He was a serial killer before there was such a thing in mainstream media...I even wonder if there was such a term as ""serial killer"" when the movie was filmed, (if anyone knows please let me know).A young woman stops at a roadside motel to spend the night, she meets an unassuming shy and attractive young man.  She checks into her room and she takes her last shower. But the question is who kills her, is it Norman or his mother? Regardless of who it is, the point is that what happen isn't as far farfetched as hockey mask wearing madman or a halloween mask wearing escapee from a mental hospital, stalking his sister, Norman is really the boogie man.  He is what goes bump in the night, he is the stranger that your mother told you not to get into his car! However unlike Bundy and the others, you actually find yourself feeling sorry for Norman Bates, he he truly tortured and definetely psychotic, but you really want to know why he is in such a state, what drove him to madness and then ultimately murder.Psycho was a rude awakening for movie audiences in the 60's, it was a lost of innocence.  How appropriate that a movie that started off the 60's was a preview of things to come...the murders of Martin, Bobby, John, Malcom and Medger.  The Vietnam War, the civil rights movement and race riots in Los Angeles and Detroit. I may be over-simplifying things but if you step back and take a look I may not be too far off.",Psycho
1016,FrankHassell,Brilliantly Done,10,21 November 2002,"This movie will forever hold a special place in most of our hearts. Hitchcock did not have to show much in order for us to be frightened. He simply played upon our imaginations, knowing that we the audience will see everything in our dreams. Psycho also sets itself apart in the fact that most movies hardly do justice to the book, but in this case I believe we have an exception. Brilliantly done and a must watch for all true movie lovers.",Psycho

You could literally transport him into the present day and drop him in just about any movie and he'd shine. I'd give the movie a 10 if it weren't for some 1950's dialogue moments with the detective.

Needless to say, it is no surprise this film is rated as a classic. Every time I return to watch this film it always has me absorbed and gripped from the beginning to the end. Can anyone think of a film where the main character is killed off early? Talk about suspense...! Besides from the infamous shower scene, the most memorable bit in the film for me was the creepy/intimate scene between Norman and Marion in the office parlour - the mise-en-scene, people...! (I chose to write a paper on that for film studies.) The bottom line is, this is definitely one of Hitchcock's best films, along with Rope, Vertigo, North by Northwest... it easily shoots itself up to my top 10 films. I highly recommend this to anyone who has an open mind to films and not seen any Hitchcock films before - the film is one experience you will not forget.",Psycho
1019,bug566,A Benchmark in Cinema,10,24 February 2010,"If you have not seen this film, watch it. Simply because it is Hitchcock's most suspenseful, intricate psychological thriller that has ever been known. It has influenced every horror film in some way.Beginning in Pheonix, Arizona, Marion Crane is having her lunch hour in a hotel room with a married man. They discuss marriage, and money. Later, a discontented Marion easily steals $40,000 to help fix her problems. Frightened, she leaves town and shakes off a policeman and she swaps her car. Later it starts raining and she spends a quiet evening at the Bates Motel...The acting is amazing, especially Anthony Perkins as the innocent, troubled Norman Bates. Bernard Hermann's score is suitably eerie and years ahead of its time, complementing George Tomasini's interesting editing. Add all its shocking ingredients, the famous shower scene and a Hitchcock cameo and you have a perfect film.10/10",Psycho

1021,adriana_nav,!better than a lot of modern day horror films!,9,16 October 2007,"I really liked the movie but I don't think that it lived up to what I had expected I to be. Don't get me wrong it really was a very good film but It had been hyped up so much that I thought it was going to become my favorite. The movie is about a young woman who is having an affair with a married man. The man she is having an affair with is not financially stable to be able to leave his wife and pay alimony. When her boss asks her to deposit 40,000 dollars in the bank for him she decides to take the money instead. She decides to drive to California from Arizona to meet him and start a life with him.Her journey there is very suspenseful, she gets followed by a police officer and you could tell that he's onto her. The police officer even follows her into a car dealership where she decides to trade in her car for a new one. At this point I am already jumping out of my seat because of the music that Hitchcock uses to follow the action in the movie. I can see why the soundtrack to the movie made it even better but I couldn't stand it! It was driving me nuts I had no idea when to expect something bad to happen, I guess it did its job because it sure had me at the edge of my seat.I guess the one thing that did bother me was the pace of the movie, I felt like it was just way too slow. Perhaps this is just because it was in black and white so it seemed a little duller and slow to me. When I was watching it I already knew to expect the shower scene to be the best scene of all. I was absolutely shocked that it happened so fast in the movie. This movie is very well known but the shower scene is infamous so for it to take place so early in the movie it really made me wonder where the movie was going to go next. It is the biggest turning point in the movie, but I have to say it didn't really scare me. Don't get me wrong I love the fact that it was not gory but I just didn't think it was very realistic. Im sure that is just because I have already seen so many movies that were brutally gruesome but considering that this one wasn't it definitely made its point without giving away the identity of the killer. The end of the movie was mind blowingly hilarious and terrifying all at the same time, I don't want to give the ending away but its definitely something that you don't see coming. The twist reminded me of the feeling I had when I watched the sixth sense, it was that good! Overall I have to say the movie was pretty good, the climax and twist definitely makes up for any other shortcomings that the film might have had. I just wish I had been around when it first came out, Im sure that I would have appreciated it a lot more.",Psycho
1022,c-carolinebeat,Best Film by Hitchcock,10,6 June 2016,"I was entirely impressed by this movie, since the beginning you feel something bad is gonna happen because of the music and the dialogues, but you won't understand until the end what is all about. You think the story goes on one direction but then you realized you were wrong talking about the characters and their motivations. You really feel you're watching a thriller, you feel as nervous as Marion all the time. The music was amazing, the scenes and the script. I would say it's a perfect movie. I wanna keep the story like that and won't watch the other Psycho movies. It is also interesting to know all what the movie involved during the production and after. For example the shower scene is one of the most memorable in horror films, the relationship between Norman and his mother is 'represented' in the Simpsons by Director Skyner and his mother, and, Antony Perkins couldn't get more success after his performance and he died in 1992, he got VIH.",Psycho

1024,jarnone822,The best suspense motion picture ever made!,10,1 August 2011,"I don't think that any thriller or horror movie can match the quality of the Master of Suspense Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". It's a vanguard suspense picture. From the amazing score by Bernard Herrmann to the infamous shower scene, this film will always be timeless. The films opens with the kinetic credits, made up of black and gray lines, done by Saul Bass. The film gains more suspense with the musical score made up only by strings. The film's dialogue manages to keep the film interesting, including the parlor scene, between Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, which lasts about 10 minutes, then finally, there's the shower scene, which took a week to film, and it's probably the best scene in movie history. 78 different shots in 45 seconds and it was shot wonderfully. There are only 2 murders in this film, yet this film was the first ""slasher"", which inspired John Carpenter's ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""A Nightmare on Elm Street"" and a couple more. It's amazing thinking that this one movie did that all. I think this film probably has the most shocking ending in movie history. It freaked me out and I could only imagine how scary it must have been seeing it in a theater back in it's original 1960 release. The film's 6 and a half minute trailer, with Alfred Hitchcock giving a tour of the Bates Motel is only a teaser, so it doesn't tell you much about the film, so I wonder how shocking the shower scene must have been. Altogether, ""Psycho"" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, and I think it's probably my favorite film of his. From the amazing acting from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, John Gavin, Vera Miles, and Martin Balsam to the surprisingly small $800,000 budget to the infamous Bates Motel and shower scene, along with the reputation this movie earned (#1 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills and #14 on 100 Years...100 Movies), this film is defiantly the best shocker film from the best director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock.",Psycho

1029,charles_edward_obrien,The Horror That Started It All.,9,31 August 2013,"As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well. Psycho, at the time, was the production that shocked the world, and can still give anyone a strong fright. And the reason for this, is because of the incredible portrayal of the devious Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has inspired many horror movies, such as; American Psycho, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Red Dragon. Of course, Mr Hitchcock used an existing psychopath to gain inspiration for Norman Bates. He gained his inspiration from Ed Gein, the cannibalistic, grave-robbing Psychopath, that had in fact made furniture from body parts. And intended to create a human female skin suit, he stated that he ""Wanted to experience, what it is like to be a woman"". Don't be fooled into believing that the infamous shower scene is the only part of the film with suspense, there is plenty to be witnessed and it never gets old. You may have been told that Psycho is the greatest horror/thriller movie. And it probably is. A film that you will remain shocked by, and the horror that started it all.",Psycho

While most of the parts are just there to build suspense the big ending when you find out that Norman Bates has been playing the role of his mother for the last ten years and has been having conversations with himself in his mothers voice while living in a small house near the Bates Motel you are truly frightened. But near the end while Norman Bates is in a cell at the police station you can hear his inner thoughts, Norman Bates then looks at the camera and smiles and for a brief second you can see his mothers skull. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is one of the greatest horror films to date and one of the greatest films. It's well directed, and well made. Psycho gets an A+ and a 10/10.",Psycho
1031,marlenebjornsen-24-939666,"It's pretty much the scariest movie I've ever seen, and I've seen a lot",8,15 February 2015,"I had seen the shower-scene, I'd seen small parts of it, but never really the whole film in a dark room, until recently. The movie from the 60's, made by one of the best known horror movie creators, Alfred Hitchcock is probably the scariest movie I've ever seen. The guy who took horror to its new higher levels, Alfred Hitchcock, the master of suspense. It all began in 1957 when a farmer named Ed Gein wasn't considered much more than a local eccentric was visited by the police. They were working a missing- persons case, found a bloody body in his barn, four chairs upholstered in human skin, a vest made out of a woman's torso and a soup bowl carved from half of a scull. Gein told the police that he liked to take things apart, to see how they worked. Robert Bloch, an author, read the newspaper stories and got the idea for a mystery novel. The first would be that the person likely to be a heroine, a pretty, impulsive thief named Mary, and a crazy woman who would turn out to be a crazy man. The movie ""Psycho"" begins with titles informing us of the exact place, date and time. The script developing quickly we meet Marion Crane, a young secretary who's just finished up her hotel-room ""quicky"" with Sam her lover. If we're watching real close, we can see that she's wearing white underwear, the pure and angelic color. She goes to her office and hears a vulgar client brag about the house he's about to buy in cash as a wedding present for his daughter. We don't really think that Marion is going to run off with the money, because she seems so nice, so honest, but off she goes with $40,000 to marry Sam.On the run she eventually calls it a night and goes to the Bates Motel, meeting Norman, a nice, charming young man who kind of takes care of Marion, giving her food and is very happy about seeing her. The dialogue between Marion and Norman is wonderful, if you listen carefully you'll hear all about ""private traps"", ""going a little mad sometimes"" and ""struggling to escape and never budging an inch"". When she's in the hotel, she's wearing black underwear, and I think that it kind of is a symbol for the contrast between her pure and good, and then when she's taken the money her underwear is black, dark and bad. She goes into the shower, and all though it's been analyzed endlessly I think it looks far more disturbing for what it really means. Marion has at this point, decided to return the money and face the consequences. So, does she really deserve to die? Hasn't she just decided to make amends? Norman who unknowingly tosses the $40,000 away, cleaning up his mother's work, doesn't he deserve to make the escape Marion couldn't? I think that in this movie, deserving something has nothing to do with it. It kind of reflects upon if our lives have a divine purpose or not. That we're just pointless spans driven by primitive needs. Are we animals?Look at the names, she comes from Phoenix (a bird), her last name is Crane (a bird), Norman keeps a stuffed owl in his office, her room is full of pictures of songbirds. Why does Norman say ""You eat like a bird""? If we look at Hitchcock's next movie, ""The Birds"" he kind of showcases that birds are weird creatures, moving by instinct. Just as likely to fly into their own death as away from it. Hitchcock so often capture the characters facing each other in matching profiles, Marion and Norman are kind of alike names, and Sam, Marion's lover looks a little like Norman. Actual mirrors are everywhere, surprising us and the characters with unexpected reflections.And as I was watching it I couldn't help but think; is Hitchcock just teasing us with the theme of multiple personalities? I don't know, because he doesn't provide us the answers. The private detective who goes looking for Marion falls down the stairs after being slashed, Lila, Marion's sister snoops around and finds an album in Norman's bedroom, but Hitchcock cuts away before we can see the inside. Lila finds the ""mother"" in the end, and we get explained why Norman is the way he is by an ""expert"" who's explanation is so flat and unconvincing that I actually started to think that it was the whole purpose, because then we get to see Norman, or ""mother"". The movie is strange and goes against all of the normal plots. We liked the heroine, she got killed 40 minutes in. The detective was saving the day, he was killed too. Then we thought, okay, so Sam and Lila will fall for each other, no they didn't. A happy ending at least? If you think that the bad guy, or woman now, smiling in the end of the movie is a happy ending, well, then you got your treat, but I think it's rather scary.I was scared to be honest, I mean, the worst horror movies are the kinds that are realistic, the ones where we kind of think that it could actually happen. I mean, think about it for a second, how much more realistic is it that there's a man living next door who's a serial killer, a real psychopath rather than a corpse climbing out of the dark? I think that what makes this movie scary, is that it's totally realistic, and it shows us that the darkness of this world, of the human mind can be just as scary even though it was a low-budget film.",Psycho
1032,acdcrocks11,Psycho Rocks,10,17 January 2006,"Psycho is, without a doubt, one of the best thrillers of all time. here is a quick review. Marion Crane goes on the run with $40,000 to help her boyfriend. She decides to return the money. She then decides to take refugee at the Bates Motel. There she meets Norman Bates, the friendly but strange man that runs the motel. He seems to be controlled by his jealous mother. Marion is taking a shower when ""Mother"" comes in and stabs her to death. Like a good boy, Norman cleans up for mother. when a private detective comes looking for Marion, Norman tells him that ""Mother"" is an invalid. He goes up to the house anyway.

1033,victoriadipalma,You need to watch Psycho!,10,9 June 2015,"Psycho is the most interesting movie I've watched. EVER. After stealing $40,000 from the bank where she works ($40,000 is worth more then than it is now) and wants to drive to where her boyfriend lives. But before she can get there, a huge thunderstorm starts and she takes cover at Bates Motel. At the desk is a shy, nice man, who gives her a room and invites her to dinner. The rest is permanently engraved in horror movie history! Norman Bates is a truly sympathetic villain. In fact, I shouldn't even be calling him a villain. It wasn't his fault that he grew creepily close to his mother, it wasn't his fault that he thought he was her. Anyone would act like that if they grew close with a crazy, demanding, over-bearing mother. His mental illness took over creating the last, creepy, narration by him, or, more correctly, his 'mother'. I don't think anyone was suspecting that twist at the end...I know I wasn't! Psycho isn't ridiculously scary, and you probably won't start screaming during the famous shower scene, but you will be creeped out. And, in my opinion, being creeped out is MUCH more fun than being scared. Thanks for reading my review, now go watch Psycho!",Psycho
1034,Jon-Fougner,Politics of Sight and Height: The Ocular and Epistemological Illogic of Psycho,8,25 March 2006,"For those who can stomach it, Psycho is a technical and visual chef d'oeuvre deserving of multiple viewings. It has yet to be surpassed in the horror/thriller genre. It participates in Hitchcock's lifelong fixation with sight, a theme addressed by these notes, which assume the reader's shot-by-shot familiarity with the film.Hitchcock's interest in the human eye is manifold: aesthetic, physiological, psychological, epistemological. Does eye imagery signify knowledge? Or its opposite? How? Eyes function as the mediating nexus between the unknown, outside world and our internal reckoning of it. But far from being the locus of strength and understanding for protagonist, audience, or even antagonist, eyes (and vision) instead serve Hitchcock's epistemologically sadistic project of illogic and fracture. Hitchcock delights in buffeting his protagonist's eye to assault who resides behind that superficies, just as he enjoys striking through the very screen at the audience seated uncomfortably behind it.That Marion's struggle (and our own) is fundamentally an epistemological one is made transparent by her run-in with the disembodied head of a highway patrolman, eyes shielded behind ludicrous sunglasses. His eyes are not the first to accuse herwe remember her boss' glareand they signal her informational disadvantage. They take in information but betray none of their own secrets (or vacuity?). Thus does Hitchcock subvert Carol Clover's assaultive/projective/masculinereactive/introjective/feminine dipole: the patrolman's gaze is informationally assaultive precisely because it is introjective only. (We will see the assaultive power of the introjective gaze suggested when Norman eyes Marion through the peephole.)Hitchcock showcases his editorial encoding of the epistemological (pseudo-)order of Psycho's world in the driving sequence immediately following this encounter. This sequence intercuts with rigorous regularity among three types of shots: third-person shots facing Marion; POV shots through the front windshield; and POV shots of the patrol car. The exacting regularityfacilitated by mirrors, a classic Hitchcockian tropepretends to signal an order, a logic. We imagine Marion trying to parse the auteur's sententious geometry. But no understanding emerges. Elegant as it is, the shot pattern means nothing and reveals nothing, since Hitchcock is a cynic. Alongside such theoretical obfuscations, physical objects designed to enlighten instead prove occlusive: rather than informing, a newspaper conceals (money); rather illuminating, headlights blind (Marion).Eye imagery participates in another spurious rule-of-thumb: the equation that height equals knowledge and therefore power. Hitchcock implies this parsimony in the dinner scene in the parlor. At first, level shots of Marion are interpolated with steep low-angle shots of Norman's birds eyeing her as their prey. Then level shots of her eating take turns with shallow low-angle shots of Norman, a subtler predator but a predator nonetheless. At the first mention of his mother, his eyes turn up the hill to her, the most psychically powerful predator of all. In contrast to the retina-dominated view we have heretofore had of him, his upturned eyes now acknowledge their own master (Mother) and expose their whitesthe polar opposite of the policeman's absorptive black holes. (There are several other eye references in this scene. For instance, Marion mentions wishing for her own ""private island,"" a pun on the ""private eye-land"" that the Bates residence will become when Abrogast arrives.)This particular ocular motif is one of several at work during the most profoundly dissociative crisis of the film: Marion's murder. The first noteworthy shot is Marion's POV as she looks up at the projective eye of the shower (a six-foot showerhead was built to get the shot). A virtually identical shot follows her murder. But whose POV is it now?! That the POV outlasts its owner is a callous offense to be sure, one which forces the viewer, in the name of consistency, to retroactively recast the first instance as an aperspectival moment of purely aesthetic cinema. Our identification with her is retroactively denied. As we fall into the black hole of the drainwhich, in concert with the projective showerhead to which it cinematographically replies, constitutes a further sham logic on the director's partand then emerge from Marion's vacant retina, we are cast out of all comprehension. The ultra-close-up dismembers her face, as if unseating her very self from her eyes and draining it out her gaping mouth and nostril. It is no accident that her eye now lies an inch from the ground. Her effacement from the land of the knowable is consummated when she is swallowed down into the swamp's mammoth retina. Culminating the corruption of the height heuristic is the relegation of the final battle to the Freudian basement, rather than the Freudian attic, the latter which is understood as the true pinnacle of psychodynamic knowledge and power for several reasons, viz: (1) topologically, the attic has the highest altitude on the Bates estate; (2) historically, it bears all the artifacts of Norman's imprisoned childhood (particularly ironic is the ""Eroica"" record), the personal font of his identificatory crisis; and (3) symbolically, it represents Mother, the ultimate authority. Instead, Marion discovers the truth in the unceremonious fruit cellar! And what a truth: far from projecting from on high, Mother's eyes are instead absorptive sockets, penetrable by a mere swinging light bulb. Meanwhile, the paradoxical co-location of Norman-qua-Mother in the same room with Mother's corpse collapses the Bates family structure, necessitating Norman's exile from Eden.Hitchcock's cinematic forked tongue utters its final deception in the spurious resolution of the last shot, the excavation of Marion's car. Structurally, the shot replies to the opening (rather than swooping down, we are dragging up) and, of course, to the film's fulcrum (the submergence of the car). Has the truth been excavated? The revelations from the exhumation will prove forensic at best, and the arbiters of forensic truththe policehave been shown to be so off-base that we should expect little enlightenment from them. ""Murder will out,"" we hear Chaucer groaning. But will it? Let's not forget: Hitchcock is just kidding, here as always.",Psycho

Except the story that movie follows, it send one very clear message (at least for me) that money, and human greed for money can be very destructive. It also show that we can never know what is hiding in minds of people, even the one we know very good (Not just Norman twisted mind, but Marion Crane's ""betrayal""). Movie has very original story lines, it's not just some ""stereotypical horror movie"" on what are we accustomed when it come to them. I liked that as movie progressing mystery for the main characters become bigger and bigger, but not for us. Trough the whole movie we think that we know what's happening, until that plot twist at the end (one of the best horror movie plot twist ever) which surprise us all. I honesty didn't expect something like that happening! Acting in the movie was awesome,and every single one of the main characters pulled out an excellent performance. Anyway i really like this film, and all though i don't appreciate horror movies that much, i can surely say that this is one of my favorite movies, and possibly best horror movie ever (for me definitely)!",Psycho

The first half of the film has a different subject than the second half. And the first 30 minutes don't contain the real subject. I would count this as a flaw usually, but the movie still works. Psycho is often labelled as a slasher, but this movie is much more sophisticated and subtle. It is interesting that this movie contains themes of psychology that were contemporary at the time, but now would seem outdated and silly. I'd recommend the film to anyone.",Psycho

I guess it was alright but I had a lot of issues with it. The protagonist dies early in the movie. None of the characters are all that interesting to watch or hear so I was never that invested. I could see the plot twist coming from a mile ago and I'm not trying to sound smart or anything but it was just really obvious for me from the moment Bateman has his first argument with his ""mother"". There's not anything interesting being discussed here. The problem starts and ends with Bateman and his mental health. ""Oh this guy's mental illness ended up real bad huh"". So? What am I supposed to get from that? Not much I guess. Also the ending where they basically just explain everything to you as if you were stupid was insulting.",Psycho

Although, people are different and every one seems films differently, I really hope you'll like it.Still remains to be one of my favorites, because it surprised me and blew my mind.

Its one of those perfect edge of your seat films that's brilliant every time you watch. Like even a scene where Janet Leigh is just driving a car is Scary!! So tense. Its such a great film because it starts of with what you think is a lady (Marion Crane) having an affair with a hardware store owner (Sam Loomis) Marion wants to run away with Sam so she steals some money from a bank she works in and takes of to meet Sam. Whilst on her Journey she has confrontations with a policeman and a car sales-man but nothing could have prepared her for her stay at the Bates motel. A huge mistake.

The use of amazing photography and lighting schemes, the classic score, the ""McGuffin"" of the stolen money, and captivating performances by all actors (especially Janet Leigh and, famously and typecasting-ly, Anthony Perkins) add to the mix, pushing the audience's emotions one way and then another: tension, humour, humanity, terror, confusion, and a final horror.

I haven't watched all of his movies, so I can't say if it is his best or not. However, it is a really good movie, mostly because of the great performance of 'Norman Bates'. I don't understand why somebody will consider his performance as dry or dull. His performance is fabulous! It was so scary when you saw him having that evil smile on his face, in the dark when he just said goodbye to Marion. You know there's something wrong with him but you don't know what will happen next. You can guess he's probably the murderer but don't know why. The ending is quite surprising. I like the ending. Very special. Not something we'll see these days. Highly recommend.",Psycho
1050,JamesPaterson,From the point of view of a Media Student,10,2 December 1999,"I am an A-Level student studying this film for part of my total grade. There is so much you can get from this film, as can be seen by anyone who has watched the film. This was the first film to be made where people couldn't come in halfway through and then watch the end, followed by the start. There is, of course, the perhaps urban myth of Hitchcock being phoned by a desperate cinema manager telling him that there was a queue round the block, it was raining, and could he let them in? Hitchcock, undaunted, made him buy everyone umbrellas.Hitchcock himself called Psycho a comedy, and it has comic sections in it, although it is an extremely black comedy. At the end, you really don't expect the psychiatrist, when asked if Norman killed those people, to say ""Yes....""turn of head, raise of eyebrow""and no!"". This made the entire cinema, consisting fully of A-Level students, laugh. You don't expect half of the things that happen in the film to happen, but that doesn't make it necessarily bad. Of course, there was the 3 sequels including a made for TV one, and practically everyone had a go directing, including Perkins himself. Mind you, no-one can beat the master.",Psycho
1051,bamamatman,A Classic in Every Sense of the Word,10,29 December 1999,"To cinema lovers everywhere, Alfred Hitchcock was a god.  And while he may not have created the heavens and the earth, he did create something possibly more amazing: Psycho.  Hitchcock once said that he did not care about the acting so much as the technical elements of the film, but he pulled uniformly outstanding performances from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles.  But, as many other reviewers have noted, it was not the actors that made Psycho one of the pinnacles of cinema; it was Hitch himself.  His skillful use of lighting, effects, editing, and camera work have never been evidenced better than here.  Hitchcock's magic was that he could take such a horrific story and make it so beautiful that you the viewer are entranced by it, not able to wrest yourself away for any reason. Psycho is the only movie I've ever seen that grows scarier each time I watch.  The titles are a work of art in and of themselves, the photography is absolutely amazing, and Anthony Perkins's subtle, nuanced portrayal of Norman will almost have you rooting for him.  Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is truly a classic in every sense of the word, and in every sense of the film to which it can be applied.",Psycho

Anthony Perkins was electric in his performance as a deranged motel owner. I feel the direction was quite magnificent. I was amazed every time the camara pointed up the path to view the house on the hill where Norman Bates lived. The suspense was immense, at the beginning where Janet Leigh is about to steal the money and then sees her boss when she's leaving town to what would be a terrifying death.

And it is no wonder why it was such a huge success. The novel was incredible, and Joseph Stefano's script did a great job of telling the story. The sad thing about it was that it is based on a true event. The People of Plainfield, Wisconsin might remember about Ed Gein. I'll spare people's stomach fluids and not tell you the details.

Not only is this a masterfully directed suspense chiller, it actually set standards by which all fright films since have been measured.  The cinema has produced some great scores, but Bernard Herrmann's music is incredibly enhancing and simply unforgettable, one of the best ever (and it did not even get an Oscar nomination for Best Score). The more I watch ""Psycho,"" the more I prefer the first half, with its sense of dread and a fascinatingly cool Janet Leigh (Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). Hitchcock, of course, never won the Best Director Oscar, but was nominated for ""Psycho,"" one of 1960's biggest box-office hits.  Shockingly, Anthony Perkins, in a career-making role and one of the most famous performances in screen history, failed to win a Best Actor nomination -- probably because the performance was too edgy and disturbing (which is what made it great).  Some scenes are dated, of course, but this film almost never falters.  It gets a ""9"" (and a very high nine at that) from me.",Psycho

The acting is phenomenal (bar a couple of minor characters) and the storyline is excellent. Due to the movie being created in the 1960s, CGI was not used, meaning they had to rely on practical effects. Although not very explicit and violent, the practical effects are done well, and the viewer is allowed to imagine the rest. Psycho has done a great job of leaving me feeling unsettled and intrigued at the same time. The soundtrack is absolutely amazing and the dialogue is so natural and brilliant. It is so cleverly written with a couple of twists and turns at the end, which leaves you feeling so satisfied.

To be honest the shower scene that is so infamous was not my favorite scene. My favorite scene was when Marion's sister goes up and explores the old house.The soundtrack was amazing. I rented this movie from blockbuster and one of the DVD features was seeing the shower scene with and without music. It is a great example of how much music can change a film.

1060,isanchez-09497,Amazing film! - Spoiler Alert,10,9 December 2019,"A quite famous film known as Psycho is one of the classics made by Alfred Hitchcock that was released in 1960 and is very iconic to many people still today. I can certainly understand why. I personally love watching movies and could watch them ten times over and still not be bored. I truly enjoyed viewing this film and was interested the whole way through. Although, I can admit that certain parts of the film were not as enjoyable, but I think that is just because of the age of the film. I couldn't find much at all to complain about this film. That aside older movies are truly unique because it shows the building block to where we have come today in the movie world. Psycho is an outstanding film because it gave me a variety emotions all throughout it, I found myself irritated, on edge, and truly shocked. While viewing this film I caught myself almost yelling at the TV because of what the characters would do. Ms. Crane is a great example because while she was alive in the movie she seemed to make every single wrong and stupid move possible. For example, when she fell asleep in her car on the side of the road and the officer came up to her window the first thing she does is jolt up and start the car. This instantly makes her look incredibly suspicious, which is the last thing she should be doing considering she just stole 40,000 dollars. In my opinion I think Ms. Crane is so stupid the whole time she is alive, but every thriller needs a victim. This is also her character that Hitchcock gave Janet Leigh to play the role of. Ms. Lane is definitely the protagonist in Psycho because what we can take from the movie as in what she says and does. When I was watching the movie I was on edge waiting to find out what happens next. I couldn't believe that an old black and white film would have me as interested as I was. Ms. Crane goes through pretty much the entire movie struggling with her internal thoughts, which gives the film internal conflict. Hitchcock incorporated this element to convey how guilty Marion felt about taking the money. Even though Psycho is an older film, it's really amazing how it can still capture the attention of a modern day audience. When Norman's ""mother"" was sneaking up on Ms. Crane in the shower I found that to be very suspenseful. Hitchcock did a great job at building suspense for the viewers of Psycho. This movie also really shocked me because I wasn't expecting this old 1960 horror film to be such a great movie. This was the first time I have seen this movie and I really enjoyed it, when at first I was critical. Psycho was a great film in my opinion and I took a lot from this viewing experience. I really enjoyed the movie and all it had to offer. More times than not movies have awful endings, but in this case I actually favored the ending because he was at least caught.

Plot is also considered clichè and formulaic, but can't really complain because it was revolutionary (E.g Groundhog Day : Time Loop). Being desentized from modern cinema is also a disadvantage.Some of the scenes will only bore you such as the cleaning sequence (could have been shorter). Perkins as N. Bates is the only reason to watch this movie unless you are a film scholar. This movie isn't entertaining anymore, however, it is great for film study.Hence, the movie has paved the way for modern thrillers and horrors, particularly the slasher genre and psychological ones. Although, it failed to be entertaining for modern audiences that wants to be thrilled. Just don't watch this movie if you know the scenes and/or haven't watched it before because most of you won't appreciate this film in the first viewing as a modern audience.",Psycho

1069,Msmusic84,The best film I have ever critiqued in film class!,10,26 June 2002,"""Psycho"" is one of the best films I have ever seen! After seeing the updated version twice I thought watching it in film class would be boring. But when I began to hear the music in the beginning play and the plot started to unfold I found myself shutting my eyes and jumping out of my seat still. This movie is full of twists and turns that keep you wondering what is going on. Why I like this film? Well there are many points. Alfred Hitchcock puts in so many little details that are noticable and not noticeable that make it interesting to look for the little things. The plot never gets dull, the characters all are formed correctly and their stories make sense. In the end it all comes together in a sensible way which is a big plus for films when I watch them. The movies music and camera style is intense and gave me the creeps. Hitchcock really new what he was doing when he made this film. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again and you still can find new and intresting things. And it will haunt you still!!",Psycho

1072,sierrajo724,The CLASSIC Horror Film,10,18 August 2013,"Being a longtime horror fan, it is quite noticeable that horror has gone from suspenseful to ""torture porn"". Although I love all horror, old and new, Psycho was, in my opinion, the mother of the horror genre. Psycho isn't your stereotypical gory horror flick. The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking.Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film.",Psycho
1073,TheClapper,The Great Cinematic Poem,9,22 November 2014,"The strings of Bernard Herrmann combined with the screams of Janet Leigh, the knife of Norman Bates and the cuts of Alfred Hitchcock makes the movie moment that penetrated pop culture like no other. My impression is that Psycho is perceived as purely a great piece of craft and entertainment, but in my mind what makes Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho such a singular work is the deep and personal poetry it contains.Hitchcock was completely fearless in his ideas at this point. He makes his most radical and innovative film. The movie is heightened from his famous thrillers to a pure and modern horror movie. The visual universe is now dirty and grim as opposed to beautiful and glamorized. The icy and sophisticated blonds are gone and there are no traces of sympathetic heroes. Everyone who has seen an interview with Alfred Hitchcock knows that he hides behind an inflated and parodic character. In his interviews he is very secretive and doesn't revel anything about himself. The opposite is true in his films. In his movies he is often completely open and naked. He exposes the most shameful truths about himself and his life. In Psycho he does a personal examination on a level beyond anything I've ever seen. He puts himself in the space where he is the most vulnerable. He offers a ""peeping hole"" into the darkest corners of his personality. The movie is extremely revealing, but in very subtle ways. One has to work to find the treasures of Psycho. Psycho is like a novel in the way images are often suggested and has to be completed in the heads of the audience. The sexual and violent scenes are never explicit. This makes the movie even more disturbing than it ever could be if we had seen the images, and this was also the only way Hitchcock could convey what he wanted to convey and still get past the ridiculously strict American censorship laws of the time.Sexuality is always a theme in a Hitchcock movie, but he never explored it as profoundly or intimately as he did in Psycho. The shower scene for example feels like a rape as much as it does a murder(the feeling intrusion, the nakedness and so on). Norman desperately desires Marion Crane. He is sexually satisfied by killing her(it might be a stretch, but I see the knife as a symbol of the male sex organ). This scene is all about the childish shame of Normans sexuality. Norman, or the mother side of him, tries to suppress his sexuality completely. This is one of the examples of the openness of Hitchcock in this movie. His catholic upbringing would suggest a lot of shameful sexuality in his life as well. Something he has in common with his biggest contemporary director hero, Luis Bunuel. Bunuel are one of very few directors who explored his own sexuality with anything close to the amount of honesty of Psycho.Psycho is such a rich movie. It is filled with details. I believe you could watch it fifty times over and still find something new the fifty first time you watch it. Pay for example attention to all the little symbols and metaphors scatterd all over every single frame. Notice all the fascinations or ""fetishes"" of Hitchcocks that he put into it. The stuffed birds and the way they mirror Normans mother. The way food and eating connects with murder and sex. The peeping hole as a symbol for voyeurism and the movie camera. The cellar as a symbol of the suppressed and the shameful truths about Norman Bates. I really want to go into all these details, but like I said, there are too many and too much to discuss. It wont fit into the format of an IMDb review... If you don't see the same things I do in this movie, please watch it again. Even more than the magnificent ""Vertigo"" Psycho has the ability to grow immensely on a second viewing, and continue to grow on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth... In my heart it has grown to be one of the absolute best films in movie history.",Psycho
1074,deco-balleti,Hitchcockian Thrilla!!,9,26 March 2012,"Psycho is the movie that everyone has seen at one time or another.Don't get me wrong, it's a great movie but still a bit overrated IMHO. I love this movie but there are others equally deserving of attention. Anthony Perkins is outstanding as good old Norman Bates- the stuttering (also used in 1948's Rope) is an outstanding touch. The shower scene is not extremely violent but none-the-less very effective especially for that time period. In fact, one of the things I love about all Hitchcock movies is he knew what to show and what not to show (not like in today's show everything society). If you haven't seen this, go out and rent it- great film!",Psycho

My brother always told me to watch Psycho but i was like: An old movie like that, NO!!! One day i watched it and i was like wow that is a masterpiece, i could not believe that a black and white movie could make me love it so much. The plot is flawless, it makes you anxious and satisfied in the end. The bathroom scene (which is one of the most famous scenes worldwide) was amazing. Anthony Perkins interpretation was so good. I am a huge fan of movies that conclude crazy main characters. To those who hasn't seen it yet i recommend to choose one rainy night and watch it. Also i believe that psycho is one of the must see thrillers such as Stanley Kubrics: The Shinning, Hide and Seek, Lost in Highway and the others.",Psycho
1077,BigTuna92,Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho changed movie history.,10,23 November 2004,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is the tale of a momma's boy. I guess you could say that Anthony Perkins's chilling portrayal of Norman Bates take the phrase momma's boy to an extreme. Just a boy and his mother living alone. Nothing wrong with that. At least Janet Leigh's character, Marion, doesn't think so. She's stressed, so she steals $40,000 and finds herself at the Bates' Motel where she has a nice dinner with Norman-and goes to take a shower. For it was there, in the shower at the Bates' Motel, that the most horrifying and controversial scene in horror movie history took place.

It has everything that makes a thriller perfect, the start is a bit different from the plot but that is what making psycho even more beautiful, the tension in Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) mind weather to steal and run away or remain loyal, the free way scene with cop following her and then her entry to the BATES Motel, the main concern of the movie, Everything is shot to perfection. The music never gets better, it sounds to be created specially to scare you. Norman Bates has a very special characteristic in his character and no one could have played him better but Anthony Perkins. Hang on guys, because no one is going to relieve himself of the great tension from start lasting through the entire movie up till the final frame. Anthony Perkins is the reason why you are never gonna feel out of the movie for even a second, and you never forget him even after watching this flick. It's not an ordinary horror film because everything makes sense, a mother's love is eternal.Alfred Hitchcock has proved himself to be the cinematic icon, He manages to catch you through his characters in every film he has made, While this one being the best of all.",Psycho

1080,papjimbob,Awesome work of art!,10,5 November 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock takes over an hour and a half in his movie masterpiece, Psycho, to set up the audience for the dénouement scene, i.e. the scene in which Norman Bates' mother first reveals herself. The truth about her is so unexpected that it startles the first-time viewer into immediate and involuntary contemplation concerning the nature of the relationship between her and Norman.The first-time viewer is virtually coerced by Hitchcock to start thinking and theorizing in order to satisfy the viewer's own inherent need to make sense out of what is happening in the movie. It is reminiscent of some of William Faulkner's best work, in that it conjures up all sorts of unshown images in one's mind.The most amazing aspect of this great movie consists of its utter believability from beginning to end. These bizarre events could all really have happened! Go see this movie on the big screen. Don't talk to anyone who has seen it about its many secrets. You are best advised to discover those secrets for yourself, in due course. You will be artfully manipulated and mesmerized by the unexcelled genius of Alfred Hitchcock, in a way that is only rivaled by the likes of the great Orson Wells.If you have heart trouble, don't go to this movie.

1082,mokioniru,Thrills beyond belief and spectacular story-telling and an unforgettable experience.,10,18 May 2013,"Psycho. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock. Based on the novel by Robert Bloch. Starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin. Rated R with a running time of 109 minutes. Given an 8.6/10 on IMDb.com and 97% Fresh on Rottentomatoes.com ""A thirty-something secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, and subsequently encounters a young motel proprietor too long under the domination of his mother.""""Bates Motel"" the modern prequel series to Psycho has left me absolutely intrigued. I had heard of Hitchcock's masterpiece but I had never actually seen and with myself being an immense film addict, how could I have possibly missed such a remarkable gem? I'd known the entire plot. Every twist turn and stab. I honestly thought I was capable of understanding exactly what I was going to get here, but boy was I wrong. Thrills beyond belief and spectacular story-telling. Alfred Hitchcock is an absolute cinematic genius. Choosing to keep the film in black and white, killing off his protagonist halfway through the film, pushing and pulling the audience in every direction he wants them to be in. His camera angles and overall eye for entertainment has yet to be matched by any modern filmmaker. This man and this film are not only responsible for revolutionizing the horror genre, but showing the world the validity of it. Expect to be mesmerized by this piece.We are given Anthony Perkins, who doesn't just play the role of Norman Bates, but he becomes him. The character is embodied with such power and perfection that seeing Perkins in any role but this terrifies me beyond belief. Vera Miles and John Gavin team up as Lila Crane and Sam Loomis. Together they weave a team of compassionate and caring people, searching for answers in a mind bending mystery. Miles performs beautifully. She's innocent and loving and just wants to find her sister, but there's this air to her that strikes me, making me wonder how complex Lila is capable of being. If you're able to portray a character to the point that a viewer wishes to know more about that character, I give you the utmost respect. John Gavin as Sam Loomis bored me at the start but soon he became ideal. Loomis and Bates are compared and contrasted in an ironically obvious but eye-opening light. They are both extremely handsome men but Loomis is intimidating, strong, manly. Whereas, Norman Bates is a shy, childish, coward. The scenes where the two actors battle in out in conversation kept me on the edge of my seat. Once again, I have to add that Anthony Perkins is a genius and every motion, reaction, and word that comes from him in this film delivers an unforgettable experience.My only complaint worth noting is the scene in which the psychologist explains Norman and His Mother to the audience. It's a bit drawn out and the psychologist is delivering shocking and heartbreaking information but there seems to be little reaction from him or anyone in the room. Rather than telling me what happened, I'd have rather seen it for myself, Something that's easy to do in film. But this scene is necessary and it won't take a single thing away from this movie.Overall, Psycho is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's a horrifying thrill-ride with a twist that no one will ever see coming and what it did for the movie world will never be forgotten. Alfred Hitchcock toys with our wildest emotions and fears and spawns a true work of art. I'll have to ask my mother what she thought of the film because, well, mother knows best. But, I'd say that if you decide that Bates Motel has No Vacany's for you, well Norman and I will both in form you that we have 12 Vacancy's and all 12 should be filled by you.",Psycho

1084,ginowilson,How refreshing!,9,22 September 2013,"Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho. I was really reluctant to watch it because it's an old film and I'm so accustomed to all of the new horror films that are appearing all over our screens...but I finally purchased the DVD and sat down with a big bowl of popcorn and galaxy chocolate to watch it. I have to say, taking everything into account, it is my favourite horror film of ALL time. Why? Not just because it was in black and white and is a classic...but because it's so simple and easy to follow and there's no gimmicks. The story is believable and haunting and so refreshing to watch at a time when the world is so advanced and modern with technology being capable of anything. But this film had NO special effects; it was art in its purest form and I adored the film! Alfred Hitchcock is a genius in portraying a really sinister plot in such a clever, straightforward way and it really hones in what it really takes to make a film truly compelling. I felt it was such an honour to watch Anthony Perkins on screen portray such an intriguing character in such a successful way. He really captured the essence of the character and made the film a true gem. I'm not going to give away any spoilers but I have to say that Psycho is the best horror film ever made and the storyline is beautiful in its simplicity and shock factor.

The acting was unbelievably tremendous. Each actor did an excellent job(especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh). The screenplay was great and the writing was tremendous. It's a movie about a woman(Leigh) who is out driving on a rainy night(after stealing a lot of money) and she stops at a motel where the owner has a mother, but is very lonely and befriends her. When she takes a shower, the figure of an old lady walks in and stabs her to death in the shower(this is remembered as the famous ""shower scene"").

But there's so much more to ""Psycho"" than that. It works well as a psychological thriller but if one understands the psyche of ""Psycho"" it works remarkably as a horror movie (notwithstanding that we are immune to on-screen gore now).There is a reason why director is considered to be the most important person in a movie. We have heard about the legend of Hitchcok - the great director. The same story could have been rendered to a derivative b-movie by an average director but Hitchcock took it to unforeseen greatness. He made a great use of Robert Blotch's book. Where else would you see a mainstream suspense-horror film put on the highest pedestal of cinema? There's no emptiness in a Hitchcock film. Every scene has a purpose and underlying meaning. There could be a meta-movie on the relationship between two sisters, who we never see together on screen for the obvious reason. We get a hint of their possibly strained relationship at the end. But it's done very offhandedly, very skilfully by the master. The possibilities of analyses are endless.",Psycho

I love psychological thrillers that make you wonder and think ""outside the box"" and i think this was one of the best i have ever seen. I think that Alfred's choices for the movie, (director, characters, etc.) were great. I thought all the characters did a fabulous job. The story line and plot were very creative too. I felt like i was being surprised every five minutes. I also like that this is an old black and white film.

1088,asianlover-11927,Psycho Review for English 481,9,5 May 2016,"Alfred Hitchcock is so much more than a film director. He is the prototype for the making of suspense thrillers, an exemplar of genius filmmaking, and the innovator of true terror. Hitchcock changed film forever when he released his box office record breaking phenomena Psycho. With an explosive cast starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and Janet Leigh, Psycho is a work of cinematic art. Said to have been the very first slasher film Psycho had both a cinematic and a social influence. Hitchcock opens the film with what many believe to be one of the best opening credit sequences of all time. He splits the words as they come across the screen alluding to what we are going to find out later about Mr. Bates. The story starts with us meeting Marion Crane (played by the beautiful Vera Miles). Hitchcock portrays Marion in a way that regardless of the crime she may be committing the audience cannot help but to root for her. Even though we watch her commit this crime Hitchcock paints it in a way that we do feel like she is justified. She steals the money from a man that does not appear to deserve it and her motive for taking the money is love. Hitchcock even alludes that she was going to return the money but she is murdered before she has the chance to. Which is why the stabbing in the shower scene is so horrifying and to this day seen as one of the most influential scenes in film history. Audiences during this time were not used to their protagonist dying suddenly. This scene was influential in the sense that it influenced society the same way films like Jaws and The Blair Witch Project did. The shower scene made something that normally would not be associated as scary terrifying. After Psycho's release people were afraid to shower showing the influence Hitchcock had even outside the theater. Anthony Perkins gives a stunning performance of Norman Bates, a severely troubled man who appears to live alone with his mother. After our protagonist is murdered, the audience has no choice but to sympathize and find a new one. This is so meticulously done by Hitchcock it is barley even noticed. We start to root for Norman because we do not yet know he is the murderer but associate him as a dedicated son. We watch him cover up the countless number of startling murders his mother commits until we find out that he is actually playing the role of his mother in one of the biggest plot twists of all time. Psycho has indisputably become one of the most renowned films in history. It has influenced an entire genre and has become the blueprint of great horror films. To this day it is seen as frightening for first time viewers and will continue to inspire filmmaker's worldwide.",Psycho

1093,abbydigion,Psycho review,10,29 September 2018,"Psycho was a very interesting and startling film. The Director used non diegetic sound during the shower scene to add suspense, which was brilliant, because the audience got to experience a thrill. The Director used the name "" Bates Motel"" to warn the audience that something is wrong about this certain Motel. The Director wanted to use a name that sticks out and will be remembered. Through out the whole film the Director uses clues that lead up to the most startling part of the film. The Director uses an Aerial shot when Norman Bates carries his mother out of the room to let the audience know something intriguing is going to happen. Near the very end of the movie the audience gets the shock of their lives, because when the detective went down to the cellar there was a chair in the middle of the room. When the detective turns the chair around he and the audience discover a Skeleton sitting in the chair! The Skeleton was Norman Bate's dead mother. Norman killed his mother and kept her Skeleton! At the very end of the film the audience soon discovers Norman Bates has a mental disability and his brain took the form of his mother's personality.",Psycho

You could believe, no, wait, you HAD to believe every word Norman said, until you find out his terrible secret, even if you'd seen it before, or known the truth (like I had). It was, however, a shame to know that the final shot of Norman probably sealed Anthony Perkins' fate of being type-cast as Norman Bates forever, he did that good of a job. Janet Leigh was also incredible, as were Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam. Even if they only had three lines, anyone in this flick made it what it is. The shower scene looked, and sounded, real. The thing that's so freaky about this movie is that it could happen to anyone, it's not about an impossible occurrence like other horror flicks.",Psycho

The angles and the way he let's the camera, lead or suggest to the viewer, the next scene,is alone, among the best direction of any movie.

1112,alcrpntr7,A Descent Into Madness,10,5 May 2019,"Like many Hitchcock films, Psycho plays upon the theme of an emotional mood or effect. Much like Hitchcock's The Birds, the eerie silences create tension and suspense leaving the viewers in anticipation of what might be coming next. Hitchcock further immerses the viewer into a state of suspense with clever editing that accentuates the character's perspective and puts the viewer in the place of the characters on screen.Psycho follows the story of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and the unfortunate events that follow her meeting of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Marion Crane works a normal day job in Phoenix, Arizona but is unhappy in her romance with the Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Sam is facing a great deal of debt and doesn't have the financial means to get married. On one normal day at the office, Marion is asked to make a $40,000 cash deposit on her way home from work. Marion decides to pack her suitcase and take the money in hopes that this will allow her and Sam to run away together.Once on the road, a heavy rainstorm forces Marion to lose her way on the road. She decides to stop at an isolated hotel off the road. Marion checks into the Bates Motel and meets Norman Bates. Norman is a seemingly nice young man who tends to the hotel and his ailing mother who lives in the house just behind the motel. Marion and Norman have a meal together and after hearing Norman's tale and thinking about her own decisions, Marion decides she will return to Phoenix with the money in the morning.Unfortunately, while Marion is taking a shower a shadowy figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Norman runs to the room and discovers Marion's lifeless body lying on the floor. He collects her belongings and with the body, loads them in the trunk of her car and disposes of the vehicle in a local pond. Weeks later, Lila Crane (Vera Miles), Marion's sister, arrives to speak with Sam to determine whether he knows the whereabouts of Marion. The two are approached by Private Investigator Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) who has been hired to return the money to Marion's employer.Milton Arbogast is convinced that Sam and Lila are unaware of Marion's location and he decides to start checking on all the roadside motels to determine if she stopped anywhere. Milton Arbogast finds his way to the Bates Motel where he meets Norman Bates. After a tense conversation, Milton discovers that Marion had indeed stayed at the motel. He finds a pay phone to let Sam and Lila know that he will be checking in with them, but that he had to check out the hotel again. Milton Arbogast decides to check out the home above the Bates Motel to speak to Norman's mother. As he walks up the staircase, a woman comes out of a room and murders him.Sam and Lila go to search for the missing Arbogast and arrive at the Bates Motel. They meet Norman and create a ruse for Sam to occupy Norman, while Lila goes to the house to look for Arbogast. Norman figures out what's going on and knocks out Sam. Meanwhile, Lila searches the house and finds nothing. As she hears Norman entering the house, she hides in the basement. In the basement, she finds the corpse of what appears to be Mrs. Bates. As she screams, we see Norman wearing his mother's clothes coming at her with a knife. Sam arrives just in time to stop Norman. The police take Norman into custody, where we find out Norman's mother personality has taken over his mind.Psycho is an excellent film that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seats. The audience will delve into madness with Norman and make you forever cautious of stopping by a roadside motel.",Psycho

I can't remember if I ever saw the movie in its entirety before, but if I had, I had forgotten most of it. I have just finished watching the movie tonight, and while there certainly were a lot of good moments in the film, I was left feeling a little disappointed at the end. When the psychiatrist is discussing Norman's mental state(s), after he has confirmed that Norman killed Marion, Lila, her sister, just sits there listening, with no reaction, as if attending a lecture. This seemed so unreal, given her frantic hunt for her sister throughout the movie. Surely we would have expected some kind of reaction on learning her sister was, in fact, dead.

When the curtain few open there were screams, and they continued during the stabbing. A state of fright literally hung over the theater. When Ms. Leigh slid down slowly, dying, people were still gasping and crying out. They were there! They had witnessed a real murder!

I think it is a very clever film with many connotations. The storyline is original, it quickly unfolds capturing our attention, leading us from scene to scene as the story gathers danger. The film is particularly enhanced with symbolic interpretations that strongly feature throughout such as the mirrors, birds (and references to), lines, weather conditions and most renowned of all- the screeching discordant tones that warn it's audience that something gruesome is about to happen. This film is one of morals and lost opportunities. The ending is quiet an eye-opener and is a kind of summing-up or conclusion, giving the audience an explanation/answer. Psycho is a thought evoking film that is very watchable.",Psycho
1119,q-21750,Overall good Hitchcock movie,7,22 October 2019,"I watched this because of a film class assignment. Obviously for the infamous Psycho shower scene.
All of Hitchcock's movies revolve around women in affair and how they get beaten up, and also a LOT of peeping lol.
A very unexpected twist in the end OMG didn't see that coming.
I was surprised at how the camera very much focuses on the 40 grand only to be dumped in a swamp.
Did you guys notice how in the end his face dissolves with his mother's skeleton?
I loved the dialogues despite the movie being very old for my age and I'm from a totally different culture(asian). I could connect to what the actors were saying, even the psycho, so good job on that screenwriters!!",Psycho

The tension in the film is remarkable, this film was ahead of its time and many directors have seen this film and it would have inspired them like it has inspired me. AlfredHitchcockhis the best director of all time. He has made some of the best films of all time including rear window, vertigo, strangers on a train and the birds too name but a few.

1121,michaelaezell,Psycho Review,7,9 December 2019,"I think that Hitchcock's Psycho has a great plot, but it does not quite fit the genre it is categorized as. The plot has a lot of elements that make it great, such as the many surprises it contains that keeps the viewer intrigued. The film makes us believe that one thing is happening when it is really another that is completely different. Norman is a good example of these surprises as we learn more about his character. Norman is a very dynamic character; in the beginning of the film the viewer would see him as a poor hotel keeper trying to make a living. As the film progresses the viewer can start to see the weird things Norman does and they start to question his character until the end when they realize what is actually going on. Marion's character is also a great example of how the plot is able to keep the viewers interested with its many surprises. Viewers would see her as an innocent worker at the beginning of the film and then she takes the money and makes a run for it surprising the viewers.
Despite Psycho having a great plot I don't believe it should be categorized as a horror film. During the whole movie I never found anything to be particularly scary. The film did have a creepiness to it, but nothing made me feel frightened. The scene I feel is supposed to be the most terrifying is when Marion is killed in the shower, but I didn't find it scary and thins could just be because of the horror movies I have grown up with. Another scene that I thought was supposed to be terrifying is the scene at the end when Norman is staring into the camera. To me this scene was just creepy but I'm sure when the movie came out people probably thought that it was almost like he was in the room with them so it would have been more scary. There were no jump scares and not really any blood or gory. This may have been a great horror movie when it first came out but compared to today's horror movies this film is not a horror movie.",Psycho

Every minute of this movie is dedicated to guiding the audience in a certain direction and playing on expectations. The incredible style in which it was shot was monumental and taboo for the day. Through the brilliant editing, controlled releasing of information and camera techniques Hitchcock was successfully able to create a classic horror movie. What truly separates Psycho is from other horror movies, including today's horror movies, is the element of surprise and importance on a solid well-written script. Once a solid story was created Hitchcock made Psycho a visual work of art that upholds today as one of the best horror films to date.",Psycho

1125,sanander,The quintessential psychological thriller. Magic.,10,9 September 2006,"""Psycho"" is the ultimate suspense film. The plot is superbly developed and exhilaratingly full of psychological manipulation. It is without any hum-our - voluntary or involuntary - whatsoever, but this only adds to the clarity and starkness of the story, and above all of the images. They stick to your retina and stay lodged in your brain for ever - resemblant of ""Potemkin"" - but without the stills effect. And to round it off, the real mark of excellence: a brilliant ending. I remember coming out of the movie theater after seeing ""Psycho"" for the first time, at the age of 16. I was devastated. Drained. I instinctively knew there was something deeply truthful in this film. Just like ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Disturbing - but absolutely credible. Which - of course - would not have been possible without good actors. So turn off the lights, shut out the world around you, and I can guarantee you will be sucked into this ""flick"".",Psycho

Silence of the Lambs, A Nightmare on Elm Srt., Friday the 13th, Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Need I name more? All of these, stressing ALL of them, are great genre defining motion pictures. BUT, they are not THE genre defining slasher motion picture. That title goes only to Psycho. Nobody else would have dared to have a Serial Killer in drag killing off a naked woman showering before this point.However, influence alone does not make a movie good. Look at the other aspects of the movie. So many of today's horror films focus around so much gore and violence that there's such an uneven mix of gore, emotion, acting, properly introducing characters, etc. Everything in Psycho is just right. Alfred Hitchcock's works are just so great at only using so much of certain things. Everything is well balanced. You meet the characters, you feel sympathetic for the characters. You get to love them before the violence starts. That's what makes this film so good.",Psycho

""Scary"" movies these days generally do not scare me at all.  Alfred Hitchcock's movies have always had an uncanny ability to scare the wits out of me.  Particular Vertigo and this movie.  The Birds was scary also, but not as disturbing as these.  Now, about this review.  I had never seen this before and on a boring Saturday evening I decided to go buy this dvd from the local store. So, I got it and watched it that night.  I watched it with the lights out, my surround system cranked, and on the edge of my seat the whole time.  I cannot tell you how many times my heart skipped a beat in this movie.  The music, the photography, the lighting, everything combined to make this a movie that I will not forget.  The music in the shower scene that is repeated at the very end (screeching violins) is forever engrained in my memory.  I tried watching this movie again by myself today and I cannot do it.  That is how scary it is.  Anthony Perkins is amazing.  Everyone in the cast is amazing, but his is the performance that you will remember from this movie.Now, about the dvd.  This dvd is incredible.  A 90-minute making of Psycho is incredible.  There is also a trailer, another documentary, and tons of other good stuff.  They really crammed a lot onto this dvd to make it worth your money.  The video quality is crystal clear.  The audio quality is stupendous.  It is only Dolby Digital stereo though.  Just be sure to crank this one to let Bernard Herrmanns score scare you out of your mind.

1152,thecarob,A Review,10,9 June 2015,"Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known film invented modern suspense the moment it opened in the cinema. As a child I recognized the iconic imagery and score years before I ever had the chance to watch the movie in its entirety. From the blend of music and cinematography, to its groundbreaking use of ""less-is-more"" violence, ""Psycho"" undoubtedly proves that what we see is far less important that we we DO NOT see. This film married Freud and Freddy, and redefined the horror genre as it is. It explores the often-complex relationship between mother and son, the dangers of cloistered sexuality, hidden desires, unexplored urges, dealing with death, loneliness, perversion, greed, lust, and the law.",Psycho
1153,piggi333,"Thank you, Hitch",10,13 October 2002,"I saw Psycho for the first time when I was seventeen; I saw it for the second time in August 2001. By that time, nothing has been the same. I love Psycho because of two main reasons: 1) in this movie you will find the best shots and the best way of directing of the cinema history; 2)Psycho is best and the easiest way to describe the human being: dreams, nightmares, hopes, obsessions, fears, wills. I'll always be grateful to Hitch for this movie: thank you, Alfred. P.S. Thanks also to Bernard Herrmann, for his dreadful but wonderful soundtrack (""the screaming violins"") and to the unforgettable Norman Perkins for his interpretation of the great Norman Bates. You'll always have a special place in my heart.",Psycho
1154,ScottRob32,Classic Horror Film,8,14 October 2008,"This is an excellent horror film. However it does not contain a lot of gore nor is it particularly scary. It is suspenseful and has an interesting twist in the plot. The music and sound effects are well done. The black and white doesn't take anything away from the film at all. The film is perfectly named as the main character is about as nuts as you can get. The overall acting was good. The few violent scenes looked pretty cheesy, but for its time not horrible. Would recommend this film to any level of viewer from newbie all the way to movie buff. I read that this was based on Ed Gein lightly, same as Texas chainsaw massacre and Silence of the Lambs.",Psycho
1155,mlee0,The Ultimate Movie,10,5 November 2002,"A near perfect film that few today can see in its intended state, ie not knowing anything about it! Hitch masterfully lulls is into thinking the film will be about a girl who takes off with a load of money - yet that has no relevance to the film in the slightest (other than to scare the hell out of you when she dies). I actually watched this film not knowing that Norman Bates was his mother and ultimately gained more from the film than a lot of people that I know have watched it.  Perfect score to the film by Bernard Herrmann which adds to the tension - see especially the music as marion is driving in the rain, and note how the windscreen wipers are a metaphor for the knife the rain is also used like the water from the shower (almost hinting at what will follow) Superb film from the master of suspense! 10/10",Psycho
1156,mark-lovellsamuels,The Perkins Factor,10,27 July 2009,"No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film.",Psycho

1158,rvmann-2,Psycho 1960,10,23 September 2009,"The original screening of ""Psycho"" was released at the former (untitled) Westwood theatre at Pico and Westwood Blvd. in Westwood California, (since than that theatre has been replaced by the Westwood Mall.) A selected invitational viewing was privately projected for the guests, cast and crew prior to it's release. As an undisclosed surreptitiously disguised Hitchcock enigma, this version was edited with a subliminal avant-garde inclusion of a craftily illustrated ""Skull and Crossbones symbol"" and spliced into the film after every nine frames of the shower and detective's butchering scenes. Whether or not once the film industry's critics discovered and banned this effect and allowed Hitchcock to continue projecting this version extensively was unknown, but by the time this well-scripted ""Psycho"" was publicly released the fear factor had already been commonly reputed. The silence, suspended action, proceeded by the dramatic music, and the aerial jump cut filming made it a sleepless producing journey of celluloid-fanaticism. After attending this private screening I was scared out of my innocent mind. A few weeks proceeded and upon it's release to the local theaters, rumor had it that the shrewd Hitchcock created some hanky-panky with this film, so we examined the reel from our local theater's projection room, and discovered the subconscious inclusion of his secret confidential editing. Due to the critical film industry's mere political influence, Hitchcock had to remove this phenomenal strategy. By its reputation alone since ""Nosferatu,"" ""Psycho"" had already stood patented as the most horrifying visual experience ever. ""Psycho"" really didn't need any editing enhancement. Viewing it again recently still sends chills through my skin!The psychiatrist at the climax of this film played a key role and scene of it's finale who explained the events of the nature of what took place at this spine-tingling escapade.The geniuses of Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins will not be forgotten...may they Rest In Peace.",Psycho
1159,mollythebond,My favorite movie,10,21 October 2009,"Exceptional movie. I'm a particular fan of horrors, but I hate the ones that are all gore and no plot. Psycho has hardly any gore, but got me yelling with satisfying fright.Black and white really works with this movie. It's easier to see ominous shadows and I was tense the whole time, on the alert for flickering shapes. The images were beautifully taped. The plot is complex and very thought-provoking, and went along well with my love for all things psychology.My favorite movie changes nearly monthly, but this is definitely going to be my favorite for a long while. Shortly after seeing it, I couldn't stop thinking about it and I researched my favorite scenes on Youtube and made my computer desktop a picture of Norman Bates.Only Hitchcock could have made such a great film!",Psycho

1161,filmmakermr,"Mother turned 50 - Hitchcock's ""Private Trap""",10,21 June 2010,"Psycho is known as the world's first slasher film. Psycho is know 50 years old and it is my one of my favorite films of all time.In this wonderful Hitchcock vehicle, you follow a young woman (played by Janet Leigh) who embezzles $40,000 to give to her boyfriend, who is trying to pay off his father's debt and pay his wife's alimony. During the drive, you are kept in suspense, thinking that she will be caught, due to the fact that she can't hide her emotions.In this movie, you are looking for a private island, but you find a private trap, set brilliantly by Sir Alfred Hitchcock. This movie is also well known for the shocking shower scene (say that five times fast). Now that everyone knows about that scene, first time watchers will know what happens, they will be expecting it. What first-timers don't know is when.I personally like the stairs scene. Everyone talks about the shower, almost no one ever talks about the scene where Martin Balsam walks up the stairs of the Bates home. After watching the movie the first time, I was afraid to go up the stairs. That doesn't me that the shower scene didn't affect me. I hate it when people come in the bathroom when I take a shower.The plot is great. At first, you believe it is about this girl, but really it is about a motel owner who was dominated by his mother his whole life. Then, at the end, our whole view of the plot then twists, which is what makes it my favorite movie. But I can't reveal it. You'll have to watch it for yourself.",Psycho
1162,billertl,Super Thriller!,10,11 August 2010,"The film Psycho is about a woman named Marion who sneaks away from her old life, after stealing a large sum of money from her employer. On her way to see her fiancé, she finds herself at the desolate Bates Motel, whose owner turns out to be the namesake for the title of the film: a psycho. After obsessing about his dead mother for so long, he psychologically turned into her persona at times. The women Norman Bates kills, were killed when his mother's persona was in charge.The main characters are Norman Bates, and Marion Crane, portrayed by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, respectively.The overall theme of this movie seems to deal with the uncertainty of unfamiliar people. When Marion, the main character, happens to meet the socially-awkward Norman Bates, she probably couldn't have imagined getting murdered by him. The message seems to be that you can never really know if the next person you meet is truly crazy.A movie with a similar theme is Hitchhiker, in which a person driving across the country picks up a hitchhiker, who ultimately does many sadistic things to the driver. In that movie, it was also clear that you just don't know which strangers to trust.Perhaps the most famous scene in Psycho is the one in which Marion is stabbed to death in the shower, frequently referred to as the ""shower scene"", in pop culture. This scene is shot and pieced together with many short clips, all shot at different angles. The constant views at different angles make the scene more suspenseful and frightening, in my opinion. Although the attacker in the scene remains obscure, it appears to be that of a woman. Ultimately, it is revealed that Norman also dresses as ""Mother"", whenever he thinks he is ""Mother"".Another scene that best exemplifies how crazy Norman is, is the final scene, in which he's locked up in a prison cell. ""Mother"" is thinking that everyone has it wrong – he wouldn't even hurt a fly! The camera closes in upon him as ""Mother's"" thoughts are narrated. And in the close-up of Norman, an eerie feeling is truly conveyed.When this film was first released, I think it was a first of its kind in some aspects. I think that never before, a murder had been so graphic in a movie. Although, compared to some modern movies (such as Saw), Psycho would be considered a very mild murder film.But in any case, I believe the film was cutting-edge for the day, and remains a classic tribute to a man who truly was ""Psycho"".",Psycho

1164,srryimnotcreative,One of the best most scary movies ever...,10,2 April 2011,This movie is truly scary in a way modern horror movies aren't. There is almost no blood and absolutely no gore in it which modern horror movies are full of. The scary parts of the film is you can never see any gore so its all up to your imagination. And the acting is the best i've ever seen Anthony Perkins plays Norman bates so well i truly believed he was psycho and Janet Leigh even though she wasn't their the entire movie while she was their she owned the screen. The music was terrifying to say the least and was perfect for the movie. What else to say besides if you haven't seen it go get it NOW but make sure you take a shower before you watch it,Psycho

Except, the obvious things like The Murderer scene, or the motel. I only know that Norman is gonna turn mad at some time (I was watching the 2nd season of Bates Motel in that time) and, by the first minutes, everything that I think was ""WTF I'm I watching?"" everything was so ""happy"" in some ways that I seriously doubt that I was watching ""Psycho"", but like 40 or 30 minutes later, everything just blow up my mind. The twist that Hitchcock gives to the movie in the way that he does... just another director simply cannot do it. The minutes before the ""End"" words appears, I admit that I feel very excited about the whole film. I was so proud of being watching that film, and so awful about don't seeing before. ""Psycho"" was an ""after"" and ""before"" in my movie tastes. I totally recommend it.",Psycho

But I don't see any reason why this movie should be rated 1st amongst the Horror movie genre top 10 in contemporary times. Imagine an average Joe who wants to spend his precious weekend day watching a good horror flick with his girlfriend to get to cosying up. He would expect the no. 1 in horror genres on IMDb to be pretty scary to say the least. Not only did this movie failed to ""horrify"" the both of us, we did not find this much of an entertaining thriller as well(as it is just that--a thriller). Not sure why it's listed in the horror category. Do not recommend this movie if your situation is similar to what I described above.

I am only 47, but have been a fan of Hitchcock movies since I was 19 and saw Psycho II in the movie theater back in 1983. When I saw the black/white clip of Psycho in the beginning of the Psycho II movie, I was hooked and had to see the original that started it all. Movies today don't come close to those made by Hitchcock back then. Remakes can never match the original. The acting was tremendous. I was always a fan of Anthony Perkins' work and loved Janet Leigh as Marion Crane. The filming, the scenery, the old cars, all of it had me hooked from the beginning. Psycho is the best!",Psycho
1172,jdubois-213-846049,Psycho,8,15 November 2011,"There is not an abundance of subtlety or the lately familiar Hitchcock bent toward significant and colorful scenery in this obviously low- budget job. With a minimum of complication, it gets off to a black-and- white start with the arrival of a fugitive girl with a stolen bankroll at an eerie motel.Well, perhaps it doesn't get her there too swiftly. That's another little thing about this film. It does seem slowly paced for Mr. Hitchcock and given over to a lot of small detail. But when it does get her to the motel and apparently settled for the night, it turns out this isolated haven is, indeed, a haunted house.The young man who diffidently tends it -- he is Anthony Perkins and the girl is Janet Leigh -- is a queer duck, given to smirks and giggles and swift dashes up to a stark Victorian mansion on a hill. There, it appears, he has a mother -- a cantankerous old woman -- concealed. And that mother, as it soon develops, is deft at creeping up with a knife and sticking holes into people, drawing considerable blood.That's the way it is with Mr. Hitchcock's picture -- slow buildups to sudden shocks that are old-fashioned melodramatics, however effective and sure, until a couple of people have been gruesomely punctured and the mystery of the haunted house has been revealed. Then it may be a matter of question whether Mr. Hitchcock points of psychology, the sort of highly favored by Krafft-Ebing, are as reliable as his melodramatic stunts.Frankly, we feel his explanations are a bit of leg-pulling by a man who has been known to resort to such tactics in his former films.The consequence is his denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair. Mr. Perkins and Miss Leigh perform with verve, and Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam do well enough in other roles.The one thing we would note with disappointment is that, among the stuffed birds that adorn the motel office of Mr. Perkins, there are no significant bats.",Psycho
1173,grogan81,Still mesmerizing!,10,28 June 2021,"Always watch this when it is showing. I remember when I was a kid hearing my mom talking about this film especially the shower scene. I knew I would have to see it at some point. Eventually saw it on tv years later and it didn't disappoint. And it still doesn't to this day. In 2015 it was on the big screen as part of a Fathom Events series and I had to see it in this form. So I took my youngest daughter with me who had never seen it. She was gripping her seat throughout. And this was a kid who grew up watching 80s slasher films. Mission accomplished. This movie is the template for those slasher movies. In the first scene it is obvious that Marion (Janet Leigh) and Sam (John Gavin) are in a sordid relationship. In that later genre this seals her fate. And her sister Lila (Vera Miles) is the original ""Last Girl"". The story is superb. Great acting ( although John Gavin is mediocre) especially Anthony Perkins as Norman . The black-and-white cinematography escalates the creepiness effect. And the music score? Even people who have never seen this film are familiar with it. The camera effects outstanding. The shots when Vera Miles approached the house to confront Mrs. Bates. As for my daughter, the climactic scene in the fruit cellar freaked her out. I would say that is great filmmaking.",Psycho
1174,suzumes_bum,The original great horror movie,10,2 April 2004,"'Psycho' is Alfred Hitchcock's true masterpiece.  Every frame of this movie is intentional, and as a film student, I highly recommend it to any person who is interested in directing or simply in viewing movies as art instead of entertainment.  Hidden within every moment, every camera angle is a metaphor or foreshadowing of what is to come.The unusual plot structure (I will not go into details, I do not want to spoil anything) is just another reason why this movie merits at least one viewing.  The acting by Anthony Perkins is stunning, bone-chilling, unforgettable.  This movie scared me half to death, and the surprise ending shocked me; there is nothing predictable about 'Psycho'.And whatever you do - do NOT compare it to the sequels or remakes.

Perkins makes a terrific performance as Norman Bates (the best i've seen). Janet Leigh equally fantastic, and don't forget Vera Miles, John Gavin and the detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam) who made also a great job.

1179,larswjanssen,Not a real killer of a film,6,6 June 2013,"Not a real killer of a filmThis review contains spoilersPsycho is a film made by Alfred Hitchcock in 1960, in this film you follow Marion Crane who has stolen $40.000 and who is therefore on the run, she is planning to use the money to marry her beloved Sam in California. On the way there however, the weather had turned very bad and she was forced to sleep at a remote motel where she meets Norman, an innocent young man who seems to have a strong relationship with his mother, who is the owner of the motel, and he also seems very harmless. When Marion goes missing however Sam and her sister investigate her missing together and they come to a horrible conclusion. *SPOILERS* When the private detective Arbogast goes to investigate the house of Norman and his mother but he gets killed as well. Sam and Lila (Marion's sister) go to the deputy's office to find out about Normans mother but the deputy tells them that Normans mother is long dead and buried. They go to the motel in disguise as a married couple and search Marion's room, Sam is suspicious and starts to interrogate Norman and tries to make him confess to the murder but Norman knocks Sam out, in the meantime Lila goes to the house on top of the hill and starts to look around there. When she sees Norman approaching she hides in the basement and she finds Normans mother there in a chair but she is dead and rotten. Suddenly Norman comes in from behind with a wig similar to his mothers hair and also clothes that look like his mothers, just before he can stab Lila Sam comes in from behind and subdues him. The shot then changes into a police station where you can see Norman in a chair and talking to himself like he is his mother. *ENDING SPOILERS*Psycho was a rather revolutionary film when it came out. This was because of the shocking ideas, the good camera-work and new ways of producing. Nowadays the ideas aren't shocking anymore and the new ways of producing isn't new. The camera-work is still interesting though. Combined with the music and the special effects it created a lot of tension in some parts of the movie. Because of this the producer Alfred Hitchcock is sometimes called: The master of suspense. It is too bad that the movie had a slow progressing plot, because this causes people to lose their attention. Things like this show us how old the movie actually is, nowadays movie-plots progress really fast to keep the attention of the viewers, but at that time Psycho had a fast-progressing plot. The standards for movies have changed. In our opinion Psycho is getting past its expirations date. The setting of the movie is mostly at the motel of Norman Bates. The place has a dark atmosphere and especially Norman Bates house. The camera-work in the film was good because it was focused on a lot, for example in the famous shower scene over 70 different camera positions were used so you know the director worked hard on the scene to make it as good as he could. The film is also a first of its kind in many aspects, a toilet being flushed and seeing Marion in her underwear, of course nowadays this is not really special to us but back then this was very revolutionary. The use of sound in the film was good because it created a lot of tense moments an when the music started to play you knew something bad was going to happen. The special effects were bad for us though because we automatically compare them to the special effects that are used in films now even though we try not to and they are really laughable. Editing was used effectively in this film and it had to too, because if we again look at the shower scene you never see Marion actually get stabbed but because the film was edited in such a way you automatically know she did get stabbed this is also the case in the scene where the private investigator got stabbed. Then there is the plot, the part of the film that made the film so bad for us, the plot progresses very slowly and it was hard to not get distracted while watching the film, if there was any action which was rare it would only last for a couple of seconds or minutes if you were lucky. We thought the film was not that amazing for us. The film was hard to understand and it was a very slow story. You have to watch it several times to understand everything in full detail. This is very usual in Hitchcock's films so we could have expected this. The film was not very action packed in comparison to today's standard, nowadays we have much more action in films than there was in psycho. The special effects are not that special, but again that has to do with the standards from today. It was not an interesting movie for us however if you look on the other side of things psycho was a renewing movie. Everything was original at that time and the movie was made from a low budget. It set the standard for thriller movies today and the film will always be an example. You will like the movie if you want a good story but if you want more action and adventure we would not recommend this movie.",Psycho

1183,roofparty2003,As devastating today as ever!!!!,10,20 February 2006,"When I began watching this movie I felt that a film from the year 1960 couldn't possibly have an effect on somebody who has seen all the major horror movies of the last 30 years or so. Exorcist, Omen, The Shining, Friday the 13th, etc. etc. etc. etc. Never have I watched a movie that layered such powerful emotional scenarios into digestible brain food that nourishes the darkest places of my psyche. . As the movie went on I felt Norman Bates' madness slowly bubble and build so exquisitely that it was indeed a guilty pleasure to witness his final all out blitzkrieg into sheer madness. At this breaking point it was I too who had lived the moment with all of the unfortunate guests of the Bates Motel. Oh I am not a psycho per SE, but after watching this movie I felt like I lived every experience in the first person. It was after the movie directly after the last scene that I realized that a movie this special had eluded my eyes for so long. I almost felt heartbroken because it would have been the horror/terror movie to judge all others. I recommend to any teenager getting into film to really watch this, perhaps alone, perhaps not. I am just floored by the powerful use of music and the absolute shock value. The psychological thriller was born from this film. I thought SEVEN was shocking, and to some degree it was. But I was shocked deep to my core after viewing this masterpiece. Nothing in film will shock me ever again, I truly believe this. This Hitchcock fellow was something special. It took me 30 years to see this, and its much more than just a shower scene. Thats only the beginning. Oh the classics. Lets not confuse Classic with Old like so many of us are so quick to do. This movie transcends Classic and is more modern than the stuff Hollywood is pushing out these days. Still shocking after 46 years.",Psycho
1184,rachelgoodall,excellent performance,10,14 June 2016,"An exceptional story line. the acting is also some of the best I've seen. I have recently watched the series Bates Motel which tells the story behind the motel in this original film. Also the mental state of Norman and his Mother whom has him completely under control, Norma. The role of Norman Bates was successfully filled by the young Freddy Highmore, maybe this series could prompt a remake of the film? Anthony Perkins performance was outstanding as was Vera Miles whom played Lila Crane. I would most definitely recommend this film to anyone to likes mentally stimulating film. It keeps ypu on your toes and the edge of your seat.",Psycho

Its the only horror I've sat through other than the mummy/returns not that I'm a wuss I love scary games Half life 2 anyone?",Psycho
1186,bohdan-871-19412,The Best Picture of Hitchcock,10,6 July 2016,"Of all the films Alfred Hitchcock is the most famous, the scariest, the most unexpired, the most innovative and unique, despite countless attempts to reproduce this success. However, during the life of the Maestro, no one dared to direct the sequel, and only in 80-e years have appeared three ""Psychosis"" and ""Psycho III"" was shot by actor Anthony Perkins, who almost all his life became a kind of hostage to his role of serial killer Norman Bates. But thousands of all kinds of thrillers, chillers, suspension, shockers and other newly formed genres, efforts were made to intimidate the audience with what Hitchcock techniques. It would seem that ""Psychosis"" was to suffer the fate of some outstanding paintings pilfered, that is, on HR and even angles. The halo of glory around masterpieces often makes overly picky to determine their real incorruptibility. But ""Psychosis"" still draws from the first seconds, holds incredible tension and scares to shiver. Alfred Hitchcock was sensitive to the internal mechanism of the creation of fear and like an experienced psychiatrist, he knew of a secret nerve endings, touching whom are able to bring a state of uncontrolled psychosis, a genuine nightmare. Unlike many imitators, the ""master of fear knew that fear breeds deep within us and not outside. The Director forces us to be afraid primarily of their own assumptions, conjecture, foreboding, happening fancy, just designing myself a terrible starting situation. The viewer inevitably identifies himself with a young Secretary Marion crane, caught by night in a secluded Motel. His owner Norman Bates has a secret, which unravels along with the heroine, who is in double danger, as her on suspicion of stealing money from the Bank is wanted by the police. And it is precisely the nightmare that is hidden in everyday reality, psychosis seemingly normal world — that is the main thing, the fear of the people in the tapes of Hitchcock.In the ""Psychosis"" this feeling pushed to the limit, to the border territory, beyond which is the abyss of madness. And, accordingly, honed to perfection all cinematic techniques, means of artistic expression: from the brilliant to the oppressive music of Bernard Herrmann. The genuine innovations in which formal search is always meaningful, ""tied up"" in the story and accurately understood, still continue to strongly influence several decades later. And in the movie, as in most technical form of art, famous works, and especially, with innovative refinements, saved even harder. This film is still an absolute masterpiece of cinematic professionalism, skillful involvement of spectators in the game of fear. Incidentally, he was also among the most cash in the long career of Hitchcock (budget of $0.8 million was surpassed at the box office in forty times!), and the picture looked in the USA, over fifty million viewers.",Psycho

From the set design, to the perfectly executed shower scene, to the final interrogation scene that really proves it is the average, 'normal' ones to look out for, this film is perfection. (And the 'Bates Motel' series it inspired is not too shabby, either.) Was the actor who played Norman Bates ever able to find another role after this film? I know as a director, myself, I would never be able to get past such a creepy character. And Janet Leigh? Also a brilliant actor choice. All in all, this is a brilliant film made by an insanely talented, but deeply troubled man. Regardless, though, thanks, Hitch.",Psycho

It may be slower than most modern movies today, although you really follow the plot, and feel the evil and insanity that lies within Norman Bates. The only problem I found with this movie was it had a little bit of a slow start. Once the movie gets rolling though it becomes a suspenseful thriller filled with memorable scenes, some you may have seen with out even watching the movie. The movie contains a great sequel 22 years later that holds up just as good as the first.

The movie unfolds at a pace which is perfect according to modern standards. It is a guarantee you'll be spiked on your seats for the entire length of the movie. The acting is outclass with special reference being to Anthony Perkins, the stammering motel manager and of course Vera Miles (also John Gavins acting for me). Hitchcock brings out his best direction techniques and methods in this movie. Everything about this movie just stands out, its cinematography, acting, direction, story telling.. just everything. The plot, though simple, is created with so much suspense that you'll be submerged into the movie. The climax may well be the best we have ever seen (not even comparable to climax in The Usual Suspects). For the climax alone i would rank the movie 10/10. This is one horror/mystery movie that revolutionized the way mystery movies were made. All assured, Vera Miles' screaming picture would be etched in your mind for a long time.

1190,samuelratkinson,Alfred Hitchcock - Physco,9,6 February 2014,"Alfred Hitchcocks ""Physco"" is truly classic horror film, with the main character: Lila Crane who's played by actress Vera Miles is abandoning her previous life with a stolen forty thousand dollars. In her process of escaping she ends up checking in to a remote motel which is run by a young male, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who is strongly controlled by his mother, even though she died on the 10th of June, 1949.The use of shades and shadows throughout the film sets an eerie theme to the entire film. With one of the best scenes taken from behind a shower curtain, at this point you can only see Lila Crane as a silhouette of a person with a knife appears behind the shower curtain, Lila Crane then meets a grizzly demise as she is attacked. The mystery of the character leads you to believe it was either Norma or Norman Bates but at this time you are unaware of Norma Bate's death, so you are torn between the friendly but creepy Norman or the unseen (Except for a shadow in her bedroom window) Norma. The fast edits and audio throughout this scene represent the chaos that is currently taking place, the screeching of a violin shows that it is a violent attack and is used to shock the audience with loud and uncommon sounds. The final scene of the film shows Norman Bates in the prison cell alone, the frame starts of as a wide shot but is slowly getting closer to Normans face while a voice over, which is in his mothers voice is talking about how he's not even going to hurt a fly. This show's that he has truly gone insane and believes he is fully innocent. As the framing of the shot comes closer to his face, he looks into the camera and smiles while the screen fades to the vehicle where he hid Lila Crane's body that is being pulled from the swamp. For a brief second in this shot you see his mothers corpse' teeth over the top of his smile, this represents that his mother's half of his mind has taken over.",Psycho

Marion stealing the $40,000 seems crucial to where the film is going when it happens, and when you realize that it holds no real relevance to the plot, it intensifies the classic and surprising ending.

1193,MCandy14,My favourite film of all time!,10,13 November 2014,"By far the greatest work of The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. When I watched this film for the first time aged 16, I was sucked in by the plot, the characters, Bernard Herrmann's score and the terrific acting. I went in knowing one thing about the movie, and that was that there is a shower scene. It was the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen and it was the first mystery/thriller I'd ever seen. Now I am a big fan of both Hitch and the genre.The best aspect of this movie is the fantastic acting. What can you say that hasn't already been said about the performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates except that it's a tragedy he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His delivering of the script, his shyness and sudden twists is one of the best acting performances I've witnessed. But that doesn't take away from the rest of the cast. Janet Leigh is wonderful Marion Crane, and supporting talent from John Gavin, Martin Balsam and especially Vera Miles, make for a film you can watch over and over.This is the first film I ever saw where afterwards, I wanted to know everything there was to know about it. I watched all the making of documentaries I could find, I wanted to watch all the sequels (Psycho II is also very good by the way) and I even chose the film as my specialist subject in a quiz we did in my college.I recommend this film to everyone. It's full of twists, turns and surprises that keep you guessing write till the end, and I mean the very end. You can't take your eyes of the screen. You're engrossed by these characters and the plot that you don't want to miss a second.Suspenseful, sophisticated, chilling, thrilling and an absolute masterpiece of film making.",Psycho

1195,ItsOnlyABunny,Classic Horror!,10,30 November 2013,"An excellent classic horror flick. Hitchcock raised the bar for all horror movies without showing any blood, guts or nudity. A trailblazer for his time indeed. Hitchcock deliberately wanted ""Psycho"" to look like a cheap exploitation film. . . That is the mystery of why Hitchcock marred the ending of a masterpiece with a sequence that is grotesquely out of place. Whenever anyone speaks about Psycho, the first images that come to mind are those of Janet Leigh being hacked to death in the shower. The scene is so famous that even people who have not seen the movie are aware of it. Bernard Herrmann's strident, discordant music has been used in countless other movies to denote the appearance of a ""psycho."" The brilliance of the scene lies in the editing. Those who go frame-by-frame through it will note how much is left to the imagination. We see a knife, blood (actually chocolate syrup), water, and a woman's naked body (with certain parts strategically concealed from the camera), but only briefly is the penetration of the blade into the flesh shown*. The full horror of the murder is only hinted at on-screen. It takes the power of the viewer's imagination to fill in the blanks. Brilliant movie indeed.",Psycho
1196,movie-guru91,"""He wouldn't even harm a fly...""",10,22 March 2018,"Often referred to as the most famous and influential horror film of all time, Psycho broke down all barriers of comfort and escape when going to the pictures. With people fainting and screaming uncontrollably in their seats at the time of release, the film is still as unsettling and nerve-wrecking as it was 50 years ago, and has cemented Alfred Hitchcock as the true master of suspense.Adapted from the significantly less successful novel from Robert Bloch, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a young attractive woman who has stolen $40,000 from the bank where she works, in order to runaway with her already-married lover. After driving all night in pouring rain, she stops at the Bates motel off the freeway for a night-in, and meets the nervous, bumbling Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who is quite taken with her upon first sight. In one of the most staggering sequences in film history, she is stabbed to death while taking a shower, and as she is reported missing and people begin looking for her, the truth of Norman Bates and his 'motel' will be revealed.Never before had the main character been brutally murdered only halfway through - let alone an attractive leading lady - and never before had such a brutal antagonist been so normal, relatable and above all, human. Beautifully shot in black and white and carried by an unforgettable score from the late Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock in all his genius draws us in with a twisted concoction of sex, murder and madness, never letting us forget even to this day that real horror may be right around the corner. All the performances are top-notch, particularly that of Perkins who as cinema's most unlikely serial killer stumbles through the film with every breath of confidence stripped from him by his overbearing invalid mother.",Psycho

The trouble is it has been over-sold in the last twenty years or so that it is known as the film with THAT scene in the shower. There's so much more to it than that. It is arguably the most influential film ever made, and the best directed one at that. Without it, there would be no Jaws, no Godfather, no Star Wars. Psycho may not be the greatest film ever made, nor the scariest film ever made, but is probably the best crafted thriller and a fine example of cinematic manipulation. Psycho continues to influence filmmakers. Look at the Psycho references in 2005's Houseof Wax (preservered mother, twin sons/ split personality, scary house on the hill.)

The acting is suburb especially for the era the film was made and of course the directing is brilliant. Anthony Perkins does an amazing job as Norman Bates and really made a lasting performance. You really feel he has an unhealthy relationship with his dead mother and you you may be thrown of by the fact he committed the murders, after a while you think ""I knew it"". He is like that weird kid at school who you know is going to snap. In my opinion, he made the movie. Of course he didn't do it alone he had Very Mills, Janet Leigh, and many more supporting actors/actresses. This movie really keeps you hooked until the incredible ending and keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout. This is one of those movies that scares you without using cheap jump scares or tons of gore. One of the major factors contributing to the scare level is the soundtrack. I'm sure most people know the music played over the infamous shower scene, but people overlook the eerie music played throughout the film.

Hitchcock is known for Movies with surprise endings while keeping you wondering what will happen next. This film is a must see for everyone, even those who do not like horror movies.The movie is about a woman, Marion Crain (Janet Leigh)who seems to be a little on the naughty side, but honest. Marion is honest until the day she decides to steal $40,000 in cash from her employer. Marion leaves town by vehicle to be with her boyfriend who is penniless. Marion travels a long distance and starts to get tired and pulls into the Bates Motel. She has a surprise waiting for her there. The plot thickens from here. I will not go into plot detail for those of you who have not viewed the film, but the suspense is uncanny in the way Hitchcock directed the movie.Hitchcock uses music and lighting in a way that draws the audience's full attention and makes the viewers become a part of the film. The suspense in this film is beyond comprehension, in the way that a person has not lived until you have viewed this film. No film of this time has been able to top this suspenseful thriller. The fact that the movie is in black and white makes the film unusually dramatic. Viewers thought Notorious was good, but Psycho is even better. Hitchcock has plenty of surprises and keeps his audience guessing. The dramatic lighting, camera angles, and suspenseful music make Psycho one of his best.If you have seen the 1998 version of this film, it does not do Hitchcock's 1960's version justice. The camera angles and lighting are much better in the 1960 version and keep the audience in suspense throughout. The newer version has dead zones, and the suspense is broken up. The coloring in the later film does not give the audience the feeling of standing in the scene watching what is going on. The acting in the newer film is extremely poor and boring.The 1960's original screenplay, Psycho is almost guaranteed to make you hang onto your chair throughout the movie, even if you are viewing a movie on a cell phone.

Janet Leigh, a popular name back in the day and Jamie Lee Curtis's mother, has enough screen time for her character to be better appreciated and Anthony Perkins's portrayal of Norman Bates is both amiable and creepy.

This Article talks about the purpose of a villain in cinema. There's a quote from this article, ""We're supposed to love hating the villain, yet we can't help hating that we love him."" Says Pedalino. This article might be able to better help people understand why filmmakers are using the anti hero strategy and why it actually can work. Pedalino tells us that the filmmakers are playing more towards the real life scenarios. While watching the hero defeat the villain is satisfying it is not real life, and people soon forget their feelings towards the film. Whereas watching a scenario where the villain either defeats the hero or gets very close to doing so, leaves us with mixed feelings.",Psycho
1207,ashleywiscomb,Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock is a must see,9,4 December 2015,"Being often nicknamed, ""The Master of Suspense"", Alfred Hitchcock certainly does not disappoint in his black and white film, Psycho (1960), with his certain use of psychological examination of his characters that will have you intrigued from the very beginning of his film. Psycho is a classic horror film that challenges the genre for a contemporary audience, a rush of chaotic fear and madness as suspenseful as you would have predicted from the movie that started the slasher genre itself. Despite a slower pace and dated special effects, it's a well crafted if unconventional horror film. Along with it's creativity, it has a more engaging plot filled with more visual disturbing than almost any other film in the horror genre.Hitchcock does this by building a connection to his audience to the characters. By getting into the main character, Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) mind at an early start of the film, has you not only engaged but intensively worried already of what will happen to her. Being a secretary in Phoenix, Marion's conscience drives her insane when she decides to steal 40,000 dollars from a client in order to run away with her love, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). With an eerie feel, you are sucked into the movie trying to figure out how and why things are happening to her. The buildup adds to the intensity of the unknown of who is the killer and why their motives are the way that they are.As Marion Crane tries to run farther away from her problems, not only has she found herself in a huge rainstorm but also exhausted from the endless thoughts of her conscience mind. Having to pull over she is luckily able to find the flickering lights of the Bates Motel to stay the night. There she meets the polite, man of few words, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman welcomes Marion to her stay by casual talk over sandwiches and milk. Norman then explains his interest in taxidermy and his unique relationship with his mother. Hitchcock sets the scene of this encounter by his ability of using foreshadowing with little details of Norman's parlor where the scene takes place. It is there where we find out more about his overbearing, domineering mother. Throughout the entire film, viewers have a sense of suspense always being displayed whether it is through the mysterious music, the director's use of certain angles, or even just the unknown of what we as the audience understand. Hitchcock finds a way of having you always questioning and in a way, overwhelmed with emotions while watching his films. Viewers that are from my generation could say that to be even considered a ""horror"" film or even a ""thriller"" there must be a certain amount of violence or gore to reach this criteria.However, in 1960, horrified viewers saw Psycho as such a thrilling film and to be surprisingly not explicitly violent which our generation today would be uncommonly found in the latest horror, thriller films. Hitchcock doesn't use the violent gestures to make his film what it is. It is about the psychological intellect that he so deliberately has the audience feel. It is about the buildup and the mysterious overall mood of his masterpiece that has you leaving wanting more.If the definition of a good thriller to you is gore and violence, Psycho wouldn't necessarily be the movie for you. Not meaning to say that there isn't a scene or two that will take you by surprise, but there is so much more than the gruesome feel to this movie. It is Hitchcock's way of giving his audience enough suspense, curiosity, and most of all, that thrilling feel that makes the must see Psycho what it is, a worldwide phenomenon.",Psycho
1208,andrewrickel,Classic Film,9,7 February 2016,"Recorded in 1960, Psycho is a film that will remain an ageless classic due to chiefly to the superb storytelling of Alfred Hitchcock. Similar to Robert Wise's film The Haunting, Hitchcock is able to use the audience's imagination against them. Just like the fact that no ghosts are visible in The Haunting, Psycho does not actually show violence. Instead, it is implied and more terrifying that way. Hitchcock's use of sound in this movie makes it more suspenseful as well. Particular creepy is the sharp violin music that plays just before a character is brutally murdered. Hitchcock also uses foreshadowing to create added levels of suspense throughout the film.Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane in the film. She steals $40,000 from her employer in an attempt to get away from the daily stresses of life with actor John Gavin who plays character Sam Loomis. Marion flees Phoenix to join Sam in Fairvale, but the journey is long and Marion is forced to stop for the night. Fearing that she will be caught, Marion chooses to stay at a run-down hotel that is off the beaten track. It is at this hotel where Marion meets Norman Bates who is played by Anthony Perkins. Unknown to Marion, Norman is a violent psychopath who develops an alter ego as his mother. Unable to control himself, Norman eventually stabs Marion to death, puts her body in the truck of her car, and pushes her car into a muddy pond on the property to dispose of the evidence.After Marion's mysterious disappearance, her sister Lila who played by Vera Miles, goes in search of her at Sam's place of employment in Fairvale. Actor Martin Balsam plays Private Detective Arbogast who is hired to track down Marion and the missing money. Arbogast assumes that Marion went to see Sam, so he questions Sam and Lila about her whereabouts. With no leads to go on, Arbogast tries to retrace what would most likely have been Marion's trip from Phoenix to Fairvale. It is during his investigation that Arbogast stops at the Bates Motel and talks to Norman. Norman eventually admits that Marion was at his hotel, but claims that she left. Unconvinced, Arbogast alerts Sam and Lila that he has found a trail and that he is going back to try and talk to Norman's mother.In order to know what will come of the investigation, one will have to watch the film. However, one thing is very clear and that is the theme of this film. Be wary of traveling alone and not letting anyone know where you are going because you never know when you will run into someone like Norman Bates.",Psycho

But because of Hitchcock's guidance, the music, the actors, the mood setting, everything this movie is almost impossible to not be awed by, whether you're a professional or just a film buff like me",Psycho
1210,dannyward-10963,A Classic?,5,27 February 2021,I've been watching a lot of critically acclaimed films lately and this is the first to let me down. I didn't find Psycho to be the least bit scary and I saw the 'twist' coming from a mile away.The only positives I take from the film is Anthony Perkins did a very good job as Norman Bates and the music in the film was quite good. I understand it may have been scary for the time of release and that audiences back then may not have been accustomed to a plot twist but this is a 'classic film' that unfortunately does not hold up today.,Psycho
1211,jordysdav-13170,This is the best Hitchcock movie,10,20 May 2016,I saw this movie thinking that it will be good but not the best but that idea quickly went away.This movie is so suspenseful and that's what makes it good.I was so surprised with the twist at the end I thought it was actually Norman bates mum!!! But then when 'she' came with a knife and Sam grabbed 'her' and a wig fell off .It turns out that it was Norman bates the whole time!!!This movie had me hooked since the start I mean who wouldn't like this movie! Also you should watch all the other Hitchcock movies if you liked this oneIn conclusion this was an amazing movie.,Psycho
1212,drugolebowski,Masterpiece,10,10 June 2016,"One of the most important films in cinema history. Alfred Hitchcock directs not only a masterpiece of the thriller/horror genre , but also of the whole world cinema. All the actors in this film are excellent. Janeth Leigh is wonderful in her role. She is one of the most brilliant actresses who have worked with Alfred Hitchcock. In this film Anthony Perkins succeeds in being resounding, but also disturbing. Vera Miles and all the others secondary actors make great performances. This film is also helped by Bernard Hermann's score, that makes the shower scene immortal. But in this film the protagonist is Hitchcok's direction,that succeeds in scaring and disturbing all the audience, in all times.",Psycho

No doubt, Alfred Hitchcock is still known as the master of suspense. Also the Music and the sound effects makes you to stay awake and focus on every movement that the actors do. What a great job either Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh did in this film which was nominated to several categories at the Academy Awards and Golden Globe Awards. Psicosis has become a cult movie and the fact it is a black and white movie, it makes us to use our imagination in every detail of the movie. So we can picture our own colors at Psicosis. To conclude, I would say this a piece of art, this movie needs to be shown to everyone, from new cinema students, actors and those who love directing suspense movies.",Psycho

1220,lubylou40,Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' - Classic Horror,10,6 October 2005,"Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is arguably one of the most classic horror movies ever made. A great deal of iconography associated with the horror genre these days, for example eerie orchestral soundtracks and use of shadows and simplicity, appear to have originated in this movie.The narrative follows Marion, a young female secretary, who steals a large sum of money from her employer and runs away with the intent of building a new life with her lover. On her journey to her boyfriend's place of work, however, she decides against this action but as it is too dark to either go home or continue the journey she stops to spend the night at a motel. Namely the 'Bates Motel'... Many of the scenes that follow have become infamous in the world of cinema. When Marion is being shown to be stabbed in the shower very little is seen of the murderer and there is very little noticeable blood. Hitchcock clearly knew the way in which to create real horror is through what is NOT seen. Audiences' imaginations tend to scare them the most. The film continues to scare the audiences until the very last scene, which is unusual for a horror film. In typical, mediocre, horror films a new equilibrium is usually created and the horror dead or over. But although the film does typically end on a note of normality (albeit with characters having been murdered) Norman Bates is still alive and as creepy as ever, if not more than to begin with. The film works on a number of levels. It fulfils many different categories of horror, in the sense that it displays blood and murder, but also has psychological disturbances and thriller tendencies. It has continued to scare from the sixties to the present day and i am sure it will carry on scaring future generations to come. I am currently making a Horror Film Trailer for A Level Coursework and will try to feature many ideas from this film in my project! A classic horror film that could only be made by someone of Hitchcock's genius.",Psycho

As I told my friends, ""It's a '60s black&white movie, and I tell you, I was scared"".Anthony Perkins performance is just BRILLIANT. In the last scene he's really scary.One last thing, (because I'm not good at writing reviews, though I HAD to write one for this movie), is that most young people say ""It's black&white, it's too old"", or ""It must be boring, old movies are too slow"". NONSENSE! As I have already said, it's a '60s black&white movie, and I was scared. So if you're one of those who say old movies are always boring, slow, and all that things people say; forget that, do yourself a favor, and watch this. Oh, and, after I watched this I sworn I would never say again that old movies are boring.~Silvia.dark",Psycho

1224,mmonmona,Horror at it's best,10,30 June 2007,This is probably one of the greatest horror movies of all time. And even when seeing it in 2007 it still holds up. This is best seen with all the lights out and a lot of popcorn. I did not see this the first time on the big screen but at home..I was too young but and it still scared me. If you haven't seen it enjoy it will bring goose bumps all over your body. The film does wonders on letting your mind projected the horror. All future movies on psycho paths were made following the guidelines of this film. The remake was lame.. I recommend this to anyone interested in viewing horror films without the blood and gore that now is shown. Enjoy.,Psycho

1227,jrfranco-61599,A film to influence horror films for generations,9,8 February 2018,"As one of the most iconic film that Alfred Hitchcock made, the 1960 noir film Psycho was a film that revolved around what had happened to the missing Marion Crane. At her job, Marion decided to steal the money of wealthy customer as an attempt to wipe the debt of her lover, Sam Loomis, in order to marry him. By stealing the money, Marion left her town to keep the money eventually going to the Bates motel and meet Norman Bates. With no information on her sister, Lila Crane and Sam looked for Marion, they too encountered the Bates motel. After seeing the corpse of Mrs.Bates, it is revealed that Norman Bates killed Marion; however, the murder was not done by Norman, but by his mother's persona that he adopted when she died.One of the best component about the movie is the suspense that the movie provided to its audience, which was executed by its film angles, sound track, and composition of the shots. Looking at the first suspenseful moments of the movie, when Marion was leaving town with the money, the angle of the camera switched between her facial expression and the road ahead of. In this segment, the audience can easily tell that the she is worried and panicking about being caught by the law, also by showing the her view we can tell that she is try hard to stay on the road and get further away from her town as she continued to drive in the rain and night. In addition to the camera switching angles between Marion and her perspective, the background music gave the scenes a sense of urgency and was played louder when she was near the police that pulled her over. Making the viewers believe that she was going to be caught. At the Bates motel when Marion encounters Norman, the suspense that the movie can display shined when the two characters alone at diner. Here, Hitchcock had the camera angled in a way to make it seem like Norman is looking down at Marion and the audience, while he discusses the situation about his mother and what he would like to do. Simultaneously, the composition of the scene and music added to the suspense. As viewers see Norman talk, the taxidermy of animals can be seen in the background hanging ominously. Hitchcock deliberately placed the taxidermy of animals, the stuffing of animals, in the background to emphasize Norman's statement about doing potential harm to his mother and death. By talking about how his mother would become cold and lifeless, viewers are able to imagine his mother being dead; in addition, the taxidermies were used to foreshadow that Norman's mother is already dead. Lastly, the low violin tune played when Norman stated his view on institutions gives viewers the idea that he has a spite towards institution, and would potentially do something to Marion because she mentioned it. All of this made viewers in suspense as they think that Norman may attack Marion.Even though the examples that I used to mention the suspense that the movie is able to demonstrate well were from the beginning of the movie, it does not decrease the ability that the movie displays. In order for a movie to be successful, the movie's beginning needs to be executed well to capture viewers like how this movie was able to do with its tune of suspense.Hitchcock knew his components of film well because he made this film a huge success; evident by future films, even recent ones, which make reference to this movie, showing the impact that the movie was able to do on cinema as a whole.",Psycho

1229,NGRobson,Best Mystery Film Ever,8,3 September 2018,"Sorry for the title of the review for possibly tacky, but that's what my experience with the movie says.
I felt like a real crime scene, we have everything in it, a murderer, the victim, the detective, the relatives of the victim, and the cops.
The whole movie is so well built, since nothing is by chance or has any excuse for the events, from the cause of the trauma and second personality of Norman Bates to Marion's reasons for stopping at the Bates Motel.
Speaking more about ""Quest"" Marion Crane, she's so tense from the moment her boss notices her in the car, right down to the incredible classic murder scene in the bathroom. (It may seem a little obvious that she died in this scene, but I never had taken her spoiler, so for me it was an incredible suspense and tension experience).
Lastly, we have the background of Norman Bates, who I do not know about the others, but I tried a lot to be a detective during the whole movie, so that sheriff scene was spectacular, the plot twist was one of the best I saw.
There are so many more things I would like to talk about, but as it is my first review, I decided not to do much, just what I found necessary, and nothing better than to start with this masterpiece.",Psycho

The only thing I liked in it were the story (which is absolutely the same as in the book), b/w cinematography and acting from Anthony Perkins. Shower scene and the scene when Bates runs in his mother's outfit were hilarious. What makes the film good is its story. Thanks to Robert Bloch, not Alfred Hitchcock! And come on, Hitchcock is overrated. Most of his films are very theatrical and acting in them is not credible. Billy Wilder and Orson Welles are much better directors, in my opinion. Sorry for my English. I'm from Russia.",Psycho
1233,kenthebert,Alfred Hitchcock is an amazing person,8,15 February 2019,"I would like to first start things off by saying that Alfred Hitchcock knew how to create suspense. With the movie psycho it completely frightened the audience when it was first showed in the theaters. Hitchcock for sure was the master of obsession in the movie psycho.
Also any other movies he created for that matter. Psycho was also the very first movie to show an actual toilet. This movie was very important to Hitchcock that he even had a strict entrance policy. Plus the movie made him 32 million for how successful it was. I loved the movie and the suspense it gave me. Psycho has to be one of the top three of my favorite movies. I wonder if Hitchcock had to fight with his production crew to make the movie?",Psycho
1234,rochaaxe,Axel's Review,9,18 February 2019,"This movie is great to watch with friends and family. One of the thing that I really liked about the movie was that it was shoot in black and white. Another thing that stude out was that the music was changing the mood of the characters. Almost every time the people don't notice the way a character changes how they walk,talk or even act because the director wants that to happen. I'll tell you why he need our attention some where else instead of the main point. That's what Alfred Hitshcok did with this movie. That's why this is a master pice that will go on to generations. Honestly the movie will be way better if they didn't show the person who was crazy. That would of being a good turning point where the director could of had the option of continuing the movie or let the people with the urge of watching another part of the story. But I truly recommended to the people who like the old classic movies.",Psycho
1235,ehvynblainebaker,Av Productions,8,18 February 2019,"The movie caught my eye as we watched it but the movie in itself was outstanding. All the scary scenes,were not jumpscares like they are now. No they were more than that. Alfred Hitchcock used psychology, which i think hints the title. He uses your own imagination against you, getting into your brain and playing with your emotions. He lets your imagination run wild before he shows who was doing all these horrific things. He played the system on this one i think, knowing back then the hays code back then was just terrible. Some parts of the movie he will have you thinking and another part he will have you shaking in your boots. Back to the hays code part of this, you have to admit he did slip through the cracks a bit on this one. The code was extremely strict back then not letting homicide,suicide or even nudity be shown back then. He did not put any in there explicitly letting it be shown. Yet he did let you know what was going on in obvious ways , such as showing blood running down a drain and other things of that nature. This movie was outstanding in my opinion . Every dark vs light aspect was just right showing characters in dark clothing to be evil or crooked, and lighter colored characters to be loving and good. Even the small things like the Mcguffin he got just right in my opinion , you didn't know the importance of it until he wanted you to and that was the crazy thing about this movie, i think every actor and actress played their parts very well. Not letting the plot of the story get tangled and brought off course at all, i think this is one of the best if not the best movie of the early years of films.-Ehvyn Baker",Psycho
